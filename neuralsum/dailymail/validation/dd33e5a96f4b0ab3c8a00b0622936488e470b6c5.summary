with its green spaces , pavilions and cafes , this planned redevelopment of the @entity2 waterfront looks like any other city regeneration project			1
but in fact the plans have been designed with a far more serious goal in mind â€“ to protect the island and its 1.6 million residents from a repeat of the devastation wreaked by @entity15 in 2012			1
the 10 miles of parkland and public open space that skirt in a u-shape around @entity2 will in fact be used to camouflage raised barriers and deployable walls that will be essential to battle rising waters in the event of a storm			1
the project by @entity30 designers , the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , aims to create a protective ribbon around lower @entity2 , shielding buildings from flood and storm surges			1
it shows how the @entity2 coastline will be defended from floodwater by use of a series of berms or raised shelves			2
deployable walls , clever planting , kiosks , sport areas , cycle routes and walkways have also been incorporated into the scheme that will defend the city			1
when fully completed the ambitious project will run from @entity62 , down to the battery park and up to @entity65 42nd street			0
' you wo n't see it as a flood wall that separates the life of the city from the water , ' @entity66 told @entity73			0
an @entity75 report recommends eight continuous miles of integrated coastal protection around @entity2 after @entity15 the flooded defences should prevent flooding like that scene seen in @entity2 in the wake of @entity15 in 2012 and also double as leisure amenities before and after : the @entity84 will provide ' robust vertical protection ' for the @entity86 from future storm surges and rising sea levels			1
@entity89 : existing condition , left , and improved condition , right this is the @entity27 's long term vision for the @entity84 , which will be transformed as part of the first phase of the scheme phase one : the @entity96 will create vistas over the @entity86 of @entity2 that visitors will be able to use to relax , socialize and enjoy river views there are also plans for outdoor public pools , similar to the harbour baths in @entity103 , to be incorporated into the proposals on 10th street as part of the @entity84 alongside the @entity84 a new scenic cycle way will be created for bike riders to enjoy on the banks of the @entity2 shoreline this bridge , right , and the view of @entity113 , left , will be improved as part of the first ambitious of the project to protect @entity2 the @entity84 or shelf will provide robust protection for the @entity86 from future storm surge and rising sea levels			1
this shows an accessible ramp connection that will make the greenspace available to all between the @entity124 and @entity125 , deployable walls are attached to the underside of the @entity127 , ready to flip down to prepare for flood events			0
how the flip downs would work in the event of flood water surging towards @entity2 and the homes and businesses ' when you go there you 'll see landscape , you 'll see pavilions , but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects @entity2 from flooding			1
' @entity15 left parts of @entity143 in ruin when it battered the @entity147 eastern seaboard in october 2012 , damaging 305,000 homes and leaving in its wake $ 19 billion worth of destruction			1
the @entity151 was one of six winning projects chosen as part of the @entity155 's ( @entity155 ) rebuild by design competition			2
in fact , @entity27 was the only company to bid to create flood defences for @entity2			1
' it was a bit like going to a big dance , ' mr @entity66 , told the @entity161			0
' no one picks the pretties girl because they are all a bit shy			0
' in total $ 920 million was allocated to the winning schemes across the @entity15 - affected regions of @entity143 , @entity168 and @entity143			2
this set of images show how a raised bank or berm will look in fine weather , right , and how it will protect the island for flooding , left mr @entity66 said : ' when you go there you 'll see landscape , you 'll see pavilions , but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects @entity2 from flooding			1
' pictured : how this bank of @entity2 will be transformed as part of the protect this @entity185 that could be used by the community for @entity187 , pictured left , also protects against most flooding , pictured right in the event of extreme flooding deployable walls could be pulled down to protect areas of the island from the surging water the existing condition of @entity198 , pictured left , and how it will look after the redevelopment the existing @entity200 , right , and how it could be transformed as part @entity201 , left the permanent landscaping that will happen as part of the @entity201 stage of the redevelopment this set of images show how preparations can be made , left , by closing the sliding pavilion doors as a storm approaches , right a ' @entity211 ' which enables visitors to observe tidal variations and sea level rise while providing a flood barrier also features in the design beautiful buildings that have been created as part of the architects vision for the waterfront parks in @entity2 the @entity151 was said to have been inspired by @entity143 's @entity221 - an elevated park built on 2.5 kilmetres of disused railroad tracks transformed into a park			1
there are also now proposals to create the world 's first underground park , known as the @entity230 , in an abandoned trolley terminal below the @entity86			0
as part of the @entity37 project , original called the @entity236 , the design team interviewed residents and local business owner 's to ensure their plans would benefit the local communities			2
as a result the defences may take the form of a grassy knoll in one area , but public community space in another			2
the almost 90 degree angle of the @entity143 ' bight ' acts as a funnel directing storm surges directly into the heart of the city this image show how hurricanes are becoming more and more frequent as the earth grows hotter ' we 're doing it in a way that will be in dialogue with all the neighborhoods along the @entity236 , so that what we 're doing will never be perceived as a war zone , or a piece of resilience infrastructure , ' mr @entity66 previously told @entity266			0
' when you go there in the future you will see amenities that are tailored to the neighborhoods			0
undulating landscapes , street furniture , pavilions , that are part of an environmental and social program			0
' the project is set to be completed in three phases			0
the first phases , has been granted $ 335million funding from @entity155 , and will redevelop the @entity86			0
it will involving raising a 15ft tall bridging berm that will cut through @entity113 and provide a barrier to protect low - lying ground , according to the @entity161			0
the @entity151 project also features plans for swimming pools , aquariums , pavilions , and parks the scheme , created by the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , has been created with the help of local communities when fully completed the ambitious scheme will create new public open spaces running from @entity62 , down to the battery park and up to @entity65 42nd street the design includes open spaces and sports areas that people will be able to use in good weather @entity66 said : ' when you go there you 'll see landscape , you 'll see pavilions , but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects @entity2 from flooding			1
' spanning a mile - and - a - half long , the earthen berm will provide a ' robust vertical protection ' from future storm surges and rising sea levels			2
it will also offers accessible routes into the park and provide space for relaxing , socializing , and enjoying views of the park and river			2
between @entity124 and @entity125 deployable walls will be attached to the underside of the @entity127 , ready to flip down to prepare for flood events			0
the panels will be decorated by local artists and provide a colourful ceiling above the @entity329 when not in use			0
the east and west boundaries of @entity332 , that were key inlets during @entity15 , and led to the flooding of @entity2 and close down the financial district			2
according to the plans by @entity27 - in partnership with one architecture , @entity340 , @entity339 , @entity341 , @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 and the @entity346 at @entity347 - a berm and a series of knolls will not just provide protection , but also a place where people can sunbath , farm and garden			0
fishing piers , an aquarium , swimming pools and pavilions are also said to feature in the 10 - mile long scheme			1
the first phase of the project could be completed within in five years , @entity143 mayor @entity361 told the @entity364 last year			0
@entity15 battered the @entity147 in october 2012 and caused over $ 19 billion dollars worth of damage at the time @entity147 president @entity366 declared the situation a ' major disaster ' flood waters from @entity15 rushing into the @entity370 in october 2012			1

animated video shows what the @entity30 designed @entity37 will look like with green space and pavilions
the 10 mile long waterfront park disguises flood defences that form a ribbon of protection around lower @entity2
it will feature kiosks , cycle routes , sports areas , walkways , swimming baths , aquarium , pavilions and fishing piers
it was one of six winning bids chosen as part of the @entity396 initiative in the wake of @entity15
the storm in october 2012 damaged 305,000 homes and left the island with a bill for $ 19 billion worth of damage
