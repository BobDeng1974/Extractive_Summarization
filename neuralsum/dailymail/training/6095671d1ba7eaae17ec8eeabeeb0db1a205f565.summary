by @entity0 published : 11:12 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 13:41 est , 5 december 2013 an abandoned dog diagnosed with clinical depression has been nursed back to health - thanks to a course of acupuncture			1
@entity5 , a six - year - old mastiff cross , was emaciated and missing patches of fur with her eyes and ears covered in sores when her owner handed her to an animal rescue centre			1
staff at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , managed to treat her visible wounds but found the dejected pet 's acute anxiety and depression far harder to fix			2
to the point : abandoned mastiff cross amber was treated for clinical depression with acupuncture by specialist vet @entity26 they then decided to call on the services of vet @entity26 who specialises in animal acupuncture			1
@entity5 improved immediately with the first treatment and just six sessions later was a changed animal			1
sanctuary volunteer @entity33 said : ' @entity5 was in a bad way when we first took her to the vets and we were told she would need costly care for the rest of her life			1
' that which meant it would have been difficult to re-home her so we decided to try acupuncture			2
treatment : @entity5 , shown here receiving treatment , responded well to her course of acupuncture and her carers had seen a vast improvement after six sessions recovery : following her acupuncture sessions , @entity5 no longer needs to take steroids or anti-depressants ' @entity5 thankfully responded instantly , so much so in fact that when the first needle went in she dropped like a stone to the floor			1
' me and my colleague were so shocked we thought something was wrong - but she just relaxed immediately			0
' from the first session she has continued to pick up and she is no longer on steroids or antibiotics			0
' not only did we see a vast improvement in her skin condition , but also in her demeanour and wellbeing			0
' she 's almost reverted to puppy - hood			1
she 's gone from being a completely sad and dejected lost soul to a happy and excitable dog			0
' she has the most gorgeous personality			0
she 's a sensitive soul who craves affection			0
' @entity5 's acupuncture cost the charity Â£ 300 , which was paid for with money from a grant from the @entity81 donated to help with vet 's bills			1
the remainder of the money went to pay fees relating to the other 50 dogs in the centre 's care			0
sensitive soul : staff at @entity15 said @entity5 had a ' gorgeous personality ' and craves attention animal acupuncture has been popular for years in @entity95 and is just starting to take off in the @entity96			1
ms @entity26 , of @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity17 , says she uses the traditional @entity100 treatment to cure depression in animals , and has also been successful with cats and horses as well as other dogs			2
she said : ' @entity5 was depressed , itchy and miserable			2
i recommended acupuncture as a way of boosting her immune system and calming the painful itching			0
' i put one fine needle into the back of her neck and she immediately relaxed - so much so that she fell asleep for the rest of the session			0
' within four treatments @entity5 was off the drugs , her system supporting itself			2
firm friends : @entity33 of @entity15 watches as animal acupuncture ms @entity26 treats @entity5 ' by six treatments her skin and coat were beautifully healthy , and @entity5 herself , no longer so depressed , was having a second puppy - hood - lively , playing , running			1
' @entity15 crusaders , which looks after around 50 dogs at any one time , are now looking for a new home for @entity5			2
mrs @entity33 added : ' @entity5 's the first dog we 've treated with acupuncture but the results have been fantastic			1
' we get many dogs coming in who suffer from depression or psychological damage so we 'll definitely be using acupuncture as a treatment more often			0
' @entity5 's a one person dog - when someone shows her affection or kindness she gets exceptionally clingy			1
she would make a lovely dog for someone			0
' following her dramatic recovery they plan to regularly use acupuncture which can only be carried out on animals by a qualified vet			0
the treatment has evolved from the ancient art of placing needles into special locations on the body and is used to alleviate pain , improve recovery rates and increase resistance to disease .			0
