but it was not just @entity40 who had his eye on the young postmistress			0
@entity44 , from @entity45 , who was serving in the @entity46 , was also smitten by @entity47 and they also formed a close bond			1
but , as reported by the @entity49 , june 30 , 1918 , was to become a defining moment in all of their young lives			0

despite knowing that the crater was filled with poisonous fumes , two men attempted to get him out			0

the incident left the two men dead and @entity88 was hospitalised			0
