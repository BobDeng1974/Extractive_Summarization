by @entity1 reporter published : 12:01 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 12:30 est , 8 july 2013 @entity2 got rid of his trademark blackboard for his latest performance as he headlined an event this weekend where he told his version of @entity8 history			1
the spectacle was deemed the ' @entity11 ' show , as 18,000 people watched at an outdoor amphitheatre as a tuxedo - clad @entity2 narrated the show that was meant to ' help people see @entity8 ’s history from a completely different point of view '			1
a replica moon was on stage as dancers , actors dressed as soldiers , and fireworks were all used in an effort to add theatrics to the event			2
watch the video here setting the stage : @entity2 spoke from the stage and then later superimposed his face on the giant moon ' replica ' in @entity33 on saturday has he relayed his version of ' the history of the world ' selective history : the performance highlighted key moments that @entity2 believes were truly important , like the flood that led to @entity41 and @entity43 's freeing of the slaves @entity2 is known for weaving his religious beliefs into his public presentations , so it comes as little surprise that there were ' biblical ' elements to the way that he told his version of humanity			1
@entity2 , 49 , is a converted @entity54 and credits the church to helping him turn away from his drug and alcohol dependencies			1
master of ceremonies : the saturday event was just one in a series of massive public rallies held by the former @entity63 commentator ( pictured here in 2009 ) though the @entity11 event was definitely the largest , it was just the latest in a string of public events and motivational speeches he headlined at different venues in @entity72 during the week of the @entity73			2
he considers himself to be a conservative politically with some libertarian views , but the heavy - handed religious elements to his moral speeches make it little surprise that his events are well - attended in @entity72 , which is largely populated by @entity54			1
the @entity82 reports that the saturday event began with two ' soldiers ' walking towards the center of the stage upside down before unfurling an @entity8 flag , along with the haunting caption : ' where were you when the world was turned upside - down ? ' the conservative host then came on stage and added his own ominous threat : ' i warn you , you are really , really not going to like how it ends			1
' from there , he went from being the sharply - dressed emcee to having his face super-imposed onto the replica moon , which was 35 - feet in diameter , so that he could provide insights into how the ' beasts ' of mankind became too greedy and invited a flood			0
references to @entity41 and the @entity108 flowed freely			1
the focus then turned to slightly more modern history as he praised @entity43 for freeing the slaves , and dancers were called on stage to visually represent the creation of electricity			1
the ' @entity11 ' then talked about @entity117 and the atom bomb that put an end to the fighting			0
out with a bang : a fireworks display capped off the theatrical evening the evening ended with some musings by @entity2 , where he said that more ' chapters ' in earth 's history are yet to be written			2
if the philosophical ideas were not enough to capture the attention of the 18,000 people in attendance at the @entity135 in @entity33 , the fireworks display at the end certainly was			0
according to his website , the event was intended to be more than just a performance			0
' the show was designed to tell the story of @entity8 , freedom , and man ’s struggle between light and dark from the beginning of time until today , ' his website says			0
the most recent chapters in the book of @entity2 's own life story led him in different paths than many would have expected after his wildly - popular @entity63 show was cancelled in 2011			1
quite the crowd : 18,000 people filled the @entity157 for the spectacle at the time , @entity63 chief @entity159 said that it was their divergent beliefs on where the show should go that led to the parting of the ways , but @entity2 seemed to think that it was because it had become almost too popular			0
' this show has become a movement			0
it 's not a tv show , and that 's why it does n't belong on television anymore			2
it belongs in your homes			0
it belongs in your neighborhoods , ' @entity2 said			0
since then , he has been hosting a daily program on his own internet subscription - based channel and giving motivational speeches across the country .			0

former @entity189 host organized a massive event to show ' history from a completely different point of view '
