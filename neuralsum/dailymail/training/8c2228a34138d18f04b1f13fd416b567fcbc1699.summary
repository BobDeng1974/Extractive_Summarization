@entity0 is a diligent and talented football manager who is attempting to succeed on limited resources at @entity2			1
last week , a bookmaker announced that his chances of being the first @entity6 manager to be sacked this season were no better than 6 - 5			1
‘ even as his odds have tumbled , the money has continued to come in for @entity13 to go , ’ drivelled the hack hired by @entity9 to deliver these crass tidings			1
@entity14 of @entity15 is equally industrious , equally capable			1
his chances of suffering the same fate were assessed at 3 - 1			1
@entity18 of @entity19 , a manager of the first rank , was similarly out of favour after losing to @entity23 last sunday			1
@entity14 is short odds to be sacked as manager of @entity15 before the end of the season @entity0 ( left ) watched his @entity29 side throw away a two - goal lead to lose 3 - 2 at @entity31 as the bookie ’s runner sensitively explained : ‘ you ’re getting sacked in the morning ’ was the song directed at @entity18 by @entity23 ’s fans , and while it may not be that quick , @entity9 offer 6 - 5 that the @entity19 boss has left @entity38 by the end of the season			1
following a @entity42 win at @entity43 , @entity18 ’ survival prospects moved to a relatively soothing 11 – 2			1
now , the chancers who devise these witless humiliations tend to pass them off as no more than a whimsical flutter , what their charmless trade calls ‘ a fun bet ’			1
the fact that they are undermining the dignity of decent professionals is clearly of no concern , since pliant fools will take the gamble and hustlers will accommodate their folly			2
clearly there is money to be made from potential unemployment			2
in any case , it really does n’t matter , because they ’re ‘ only ’ football managers			2
but suppose we applied a comparable test to the directors of a company such as @entity9 ? who ’ll be the first to leave ? what about the chairman , @entity71 ? before joining @entity72 ’s , mr @entity71 spent 38 years serving the public interest at @entity74			2
he has been an enthusiastic 40 - a - day puffer , and is now 64 years old			2
wheezingly good value at 6 - 5 ? then there ’s the chief executive officer , @entity78 , who has worked for @entity72 ’s for almost three decades but was appointed ceo a few months ago			2
an amply - built @entity80 , he says : ‘ i have a forthright fashion			1
’ survival chance : 3 - 1 sounds reasonable			2
finally , the group finance director , @entity83			2
this 47 - year - old accountant has been with @entity72 ’s for almost five years and , if he has uttered one contentious public statement , then he has kept it well hidden			2
sound survival value at 11 - 2			2
@entity18 has come under increasing pressure at @entity19 after a string of poor results @entity18 ' chances of staying at @entity38 improved with their win over @entity43 last week however @entity92 , is it not ? yet if it ’s good enough for widely respected managers , then it ’s certainly good enough for a bunch of bookies			2
now if all this suggests that football is being heartlessly exploited by betting interests , then the suggestion is quite wrong			1
for the game positively embraces gambling , to the extent that four @entity6 clubs — @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 — have their shirts sponsored by gaming companies , while the @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 carry the title name of @entity117			1
some will see a certain irony in the fact that last year @entity109 ’s shirt was sponsored by a pay - day lender , before they transferred their allegiance to the firm which offers ‘ @entity125 ’s best online sports betting and gambling ’			1
the dangers have been obvious for a long time			2
although players are banned from betting on football , a climate has been created in which betting is the natural , inevitable , wholly acceptable partner of the sport			1
as if the example of international cricket were not sufficient warning , in recent years security experts have told us that match - fixing is ‘ endemic ’ in football			2
yet still the game closes its eyes and ears while selling its shirt and its soul for a bookmaker ’s cheque			1
it is difficult to imagine circumstances which will compel the national sport to face the perils			0
and so it staggers along its slippery path , its stadiums swimming with seductive odds , its matches punctuated by the uproar of pushers and peddlers			0
and it is miserably certain , that a truly titanic scandal waits in the wings ; no longer a slim possibility , but merely a matter of time			0
@entity167 , the blood lab monster , rips up the darts script @entity170 celebrates his famous victory @entity173 , long ago , when darts tournaments were conducted in provincial town halls and champions were strangers to national celebrity , i was given the task of interviewing the players			1
then , as now , they tended to be stoutly lumbering fellows , with shirt - stretching paunches and insatiable thirsts			1
they had no illusions that what they were playing had anything to do with ‘ sport ’			0
no , it was a pub game : no more , no less			0
unfailingly amiable and occasionally incoherent , they would offer standard reflections : ‘ nice game			0
ca n’t hang about , my mate ’s got me a pint			0
’ that last one was always the killer			0
i had prepared my questions about hopes , fears and ambitions , but nobody ever uttered a single memorable word			0
the most interesting character was one i encountered in a @entity205			0
a large , ponderous man , he was starting to outline his career plans when he stepped backwards and toppled off the stage			0
as he lay , stunned , upon the stone floor , his anxious friends surrounded him			0
one offered him a healing lager , which he seized and sank in a gulp			0
i looked at my empty notebook and realised i was chasing a lost cause			0
i could , therefore , imagine the relief today ’s darting scribblers must have felt when they encountered @entity170			1
he is not only a darts player , but also a medical lab assistant in blood services			1
more , he is named after @entity167 , a family hero			0
still more , he defeated @entity222 , thrice a world champion , in the opening match of the @entity113			0
but far and above all this was what he said in the moment of victory			0
‘ if someone had told me i was going to play against a former world champion in the first match on the opening night of the @entity232 , ’ mused @entity167 , ‘ i would have ripped their two arms and two legs off			0
this is what dreams are made of			0
’ the imagery may be disturbing , but the impact is sensational			0
after generations of irredeemably dull darts players , we now have a monster from the blood laboratory who dreams of ripping off arms and legs			1
@entity170 is interesting ! but where was he when i needed him ? @entity251 @entity252 played a fine innings of 66 for the @entity254 in the so - called @entity255 in @entity256			1
then , because he is terminally gauche , he announced : ‘ someone told me the @entity259 selectors were meeting this morning — i hope they ’ve got a screen on			0
’ the broadcaster @entity262 asked its audience if @entity252 should play for @entity259 in next year ’s @entity264			1
some 72 per cent replied ‘ yes ’			0
two pertinent facts : ( a ) this was @entity252 ’s first half - century since may — 16 innings ago			1
( b ) @entity262 is an @entity269 broadcaster and the viewers urging his selection are @entity269			0
before the usual courtiers swoon clean away , they might pause to wonder if a and b may possibly be connected			0
@entity276 @entity252 celebrated his return to form by scoring just one run in his next innings			1
yet still he could tweet to @entity281 : ‘ great news that @ @entity283 is new @entity259 1 - day captain			0
top player , leader and bloke			1
hope i get to play for him ’			0
on reflection , ‘ gauche ’ is far too kind a term for such unrelenting buffoonery			0
@entity252 hit 66 on thursday but could only manage a solitary run two days later for @entity254			1

betting companies run books on how likely a manager is to be sacked
the @entity6 embraces gambling , particularly with shirt sponsors
darts player @entity170 is a *reporter* *'s* dream with his back story
@entity252 celebrated his 66 for @entity254 in *typical* fashion
