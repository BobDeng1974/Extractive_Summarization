by @entity0 published : 20:24 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 02:41 est , 28 march 2013 postboxes in rural areas are to be saved by rules which say that almost everyone must have one within half a mile of their home			2
@entity7 had wanted to lift protection for the country ’s 115,000 postboxes , putting those in remote areas at risk of being removed to save money			1
but in a victory for rural communities , regulator @entity15 has insisted that the iconic red postboxes must be protected			1
saved : @entity15 has insisted that the iconic red postboxes must be protected under its proposals , published yesterday , 98 per cent of @entity20 must have a postbox which is ‘ within half a mile ’ of their home			1
the distance is measured by a ‘ straight line ’ rather than along a winding road			0
it provides more protection for postboxes in obscure locations , such as nestled in the walls of cottages or hidden in bushes on country lanes by the sea			0
yesterday the @entity36 said the new rules , which will be subject to a consultation ending on may 1 , ‘ can only be a good thing ’			0
under the current rules people must have a postbox ‘ within 500 metres ’ of their home			0
but the rules only cover areas where there are at least 200 delivery points – typically , a letter box – per square kilometre , which means people living in rural areas are left out			0
but while @entity15 agreed with @entity7 that the current rules are ‘ not fit for purpose ’ , it said they did not go far enough			1
an @entity15 report said : ‘ they [ the current rules ] do not protect those users who are most likely to need protection – users in rural areas , where postboxes typically have lower volumes of mail and higher costs of collection per item			1
’ foiled : @entity7 had wanted to lift protection for the country ¿ s 115,000 postboxes , putting those in remote areas at risk of being removed to save money around 2 per cent of addresses would not be covered by the new rules			1
typically these are in ‘ very remote or isolated locations such as farmhouses ’ , @entity15 said			2
@entity7 must provide ‘ sufficient ’ postboxes or alternatives			2
@entity80 , from the @entity81 said : ‘ quite apart from the iconic value of our much - loved red postboxes , they provide a vital and necessary service on which many still depend			0
’ @entity15 also ruled out getting rid of the first class next - day delivery service			2
it scrapped an idea , which it had raised last year , of merging first and second class post into one service taking two days to arrive .			0

@entity7 had wanted to *axe* 115,000 postboxes
@entity15 has *stepped* in and *blocked* the move
