if history and a tilt at the career grand slam at the @entity5 seems a world away for @entity7 amidst the water torture of @entity9 , then this is the week when it will all come into blessed focus			1
forget the frustrated figure he cut on friday when he created a @entity14 highlight with his highland toss of his three iron into one of the many hazards that give the @entity19 its name			1
this week it will all feel like stale news when he makes the ultimate golfing road trip			0
how does a couple of days behind closed doors at @entity27 sound , with your dad for company , a couple of mates , a club member who knows all the course secrets and an athlete who is even more celebrated in @entity36 than the world @entity38 ? @entity7 plays a shot on the sixth at the the @entity41 on saturday @entity7 plans to link up with four - time @entity43 champion @entity42 at @entity27 all that awaits the 25 - year - old as he combines a bit of rest and recreation with a touch of sharp prep work with the first major of the season now just a month away			1
‘ to be honest , @entity53 is probably even nicer without the crowds than it is during the masters , so it ’s going to be a great experience , ’ he said			0
the much - decorated athlete ? none other than @entity42 , quarterback with the @entity58 and a four - time @entity43 champion			0
he has played @entity27 once before and shot a 77 , so he is clearly no mean competitor			1
for a massive fan of virtually every sport like @entity7 , the appeal of linking up with @entity42 is obvious			1
as for the club member , @entity63 accompanied @entity7 when he was first man out in the third round of the @entity5 last year			1
acting as marker , the 52 year old actually outscored him shooting 70 to @entity67 ’s 71 , with the latter describing @entity63 ’s performance on the greens as ‘ the best i have ever seen at @entity27 ’			2
@entity67 threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on friday it is not rocket science , therefore , as to why @entity7 would seek him out in a more friendly setting in an attempt to pick his brain			1
at the season ’s first major , @entity7 will be attempting to complete not only the career grand slam but a third major victory in a row , following his successes in @entity88 and the @entity89 last year			2
as for @entity9 and the @entity41 , @entity7 began his third round yesterday eight shots adrift of the leader @entity92			2
he actually made up three strokes on @entity92 on friday despite his three iron following his golf ball into the water at the par - five eighth			0
@entity7 played a lot better once he had let off steam , with the result that there were only nine players ahead of him at the halfway stage			0
among them were some powerful hitters , including @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
@entity112 @entity111 turned in a remarkable opening two rounds to be just three off the lead			0
the @entity112 was not only playing his first tournament for three months , he was using a standard - length putter for the first time in four years .			0

@entity7 created a @entity14 highlight by throwing club into water
world no 1 to spend a couple of days behind closed doors at @entity27
