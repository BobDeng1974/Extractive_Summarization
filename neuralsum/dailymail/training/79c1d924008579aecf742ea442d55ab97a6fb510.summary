@entity2 said the gossip surrounding the case , including claims he and his sisters had travelled to @entity18 for secret meetings with their father , sent his life spiralling out of control			1
the former investment banker , 45 , denies those claims and added that he hopes his revelations will help end the speculation that has caused him and his family so much pain			2
' [ @entity31 ] ith the passage of time , it has become bigger and easier to fabricate complete nonsense and create lies around it , with fewer people left alive to contradict it , ' mr @entity2 told the @entity39 ' any person can get a grainy , slightly out - of - focus @entity41 from the late 70s , of a man with a moustache and say , " that ’s @entity3 "			0
i ca n’t prove they ’re wrong			0
' mr @entity2 's comments today came as it emerged the @entity49 are planning a new documentary which is set to make previously unreported allegations about @entity3			1
they include a claim from a @entity55 - based driver that he drove the aristocrat across @entity58 on the night he went missing in 1974			0

@entity3 vanished without a trace 38 years ago after the brutal killing of @entity75 , nanny to his children , at his family 's home in @entity79 , @entity80 , on november 7 , 1974			1
since the killing and the aristocrat 's disappearance , detectives have developed a theory that @entity3 killed @entity86 by mistake , believing she was his wife with whom he was embroiled in divorce proceedings			1
it is thought that the @entity90 went on to commit suicide , but rumours have since abounded that the @entity90 , aided by associates at the highest levels of the @entity95 , fled the country to evade justice			2
mr @entity2 with his father before the @entity90 's disappearance in 1974 : mr @entity2 attacked rumours about his father being spread by the @entity49 @entity75 , nanny to @entity3 's children , was found dead in @entity79 , @entity80 , in november 1974 although mr @entity2 , who was aged just seven and in the house at the time of the killing , believes his father is innocent of the murder , he is adamant that @entity3 did indeed go on to commit suicide			1
as a teenager he says he ' forgot about ' his father , and it was only when @entity3 was declared officially dead in 1992 , when mr @entity2 was 32 , that memories began to haunt him			2
his struggle to come to terms with the lurid speculation came to a head 13 years ago when he burned everything he owned that reminded him of his father			1
' it ’s one thing not knowing if your father is alive or dead , but quite another thing to rise each day to hear others claiming they have seen him , ' he told the @entity39			0
he described how , feeling close to a ' collapse of the mind ' , he gathered together everything he could relating to his father , including papers , books and photographs			0
' i dumped them in a supermarket trolley and took them to a waste site and watched as they all went up in flames , ' he said			0

he denies the rumours , saying that he in fact went to the desert there to work through stress developed in his high - pressure investment banking job			0
indeed , he says , it would be strange for a white @entity157 aristocrat to attempt to flee to anonymity in a country that is 99 per cent black @entity18			0
a coroner , in the absence of the prime suspect , declared in 1975 that @entity3 had indeed killed @entity86			0
