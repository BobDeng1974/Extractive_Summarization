so , @entity0 picked @entity1 apart in the @entity2 , that name rings a bell … @entity6 manager ? hates referees , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , etc ? @entity0 … @entity0 … @entity11 … tinho … only kidding , yes the @entity13 midfielder with loads of international caps and those oh - so - underrated @entity18 midfield qualities of keeping the ball , passing it to a team - mate , getting it back , controlling the game , sliding through passes to the strikers			1
does n't score much , but you know … @entity0 impressed as @entity25 beat @entity1 3 - 1 in the @entity2 last - 16 first leg the @entity13 star and his @entity25 team - mates celebrate at the @entity29 on wednesday night that 's him , good player , eh , why do n't one of the @entity34 teams sign him ? well , they 've tried			1
for the last seven years they 've been trying , since @entity36 tried to sign him for @entity38 and made an £ 11.8million offer when @entity0 was still a little - known @entity41 @entity40 international who was catching the eye at @entity45			1
always had a good eye , did @entity46 , why did n't he get him ? the buy - out clause was nearly £ 20m			0
@entity38 signed a 20 - year - old @entity50 called @entity51 instead			0
@entity38 manager @entity36 ( rightwas keen on signing the midfielder when he was at @entity45 how did @entity0 wind up at @entity25 ? he stayed in @entity53 for two more years and then moved to @entity54 under cloud with @entity45 chairman @entity56 branding him a ' rotten apple '			1
it was a complicated deal which included his economic rights being split between the two clubs and a third - party investor			0
this tangle probably did n't help when @entity65 tried to sign him in before the transfer deadline in august 2012			2
even with an hour 's extension granted by the @entity70 , they were eight minutes late with the paper work and he went back to @entity54			0
@entity0 made the move to @entity25 after starring at @entity54 - with @entity74 joining him in the transfer that must have been another of those strokes of genius by the transfer master @entity81 … could be			1
@entity82 was furious by all accounts			0
having just replaced @entity65 boss @entity84 , he named @entity0 as a priority target , a fee of £ 24m was eventually agreed and then the deal collapsed in stoppage time			1
@entity82 must 've been hopping mad , literally			0
a year later , the midfielder moved to @entity25 as the cheaper end of a £ 51m package for both him and @entity74			2
at the time , @entity25 's new @entity94 owners were trying to sign anyone who moved , including @entity96			2
@entity81 and @entity65 were minutes away from acquiring @entity0 's services at one stage i thought @entity25 had sold all their big names … yes , the strategy quickly changed			1
@entity74 was sold to @entity103 , a year later , after an impressive @entity104 and @entity105 was loaned to @entity106 where he festers on the bench			2
there were rumours of a bust - up between @entity0 and the club and he was said to have thrown in a transfer request back in august when the exodus was in full swing			2
but he stayed and says he is focused on the season at @entity25 and is in good touch , as @entity1 discovered			1
he returned from an ankle injury in time to sparkle at the @entity29 and remind everyone he is perhaps the last of the club 's prized assets , but the @entity123 club are producing a new generation promising young players			0
@entity0 returned from an ankle injury in time to sparkle at the @entity29 will we see him in @entity34 ? there is still interest from all the big clubs , including @entity1 , @entity6 and @entity106			1
they are aware of his situation and @entity25 's change of strategy under the strict @entity136 rules			0
but they will be aware of his complicated ownership background			0
with his previous failed attempts to move to the @entity70 he might accept his destiny is elsewhere			0
@entity1 , @entity6 and @entity106 are still interested in the @entity13 international			1

@entity25 beat @entity1 3 - 1 in the @entity2 last - 16 first leg
@entity0 sparkled at the @entity29 on wednesday night
the @entity13 midfielder was minutes away from signing for @entity65
@entity106 , @entity1 and @entity6 still interested in @entity0
@entity150 : @entity0 puts in *perfect* *performance*
