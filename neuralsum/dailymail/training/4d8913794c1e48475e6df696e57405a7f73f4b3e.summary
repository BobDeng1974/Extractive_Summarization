it looks like something straight out of @entity2 – and the story behind it is almost as fantastical			0
this cottage cost just £ 150 to build , using only natural or reclaimed materials , and is now rented out for a fee of fresh milk and cream			1
and with no mains electricity , gas or water , the bills do n’t come to much either			0
he taught himself the method by reading a book , even shaping the walls without a single power tool			0
he also made the simple wooden roof frame and thatched it himself with straw from his fields			0
the 300 sq ft of floor space features floorboards rescued from a skip , while an old windscreen from a lorry provided glass for the windows			0
with no central heating , you might think it would be a bit chilly , but he says the cob walls and thatched roof make it incredibly well insulated – and the ceiling is stuffed with sheep ’s wool from a nearby farm to help keep the heat in further			2
@entity78 : mr @entity16 , pictured outside the cob house , said he wanted to challenge the notion that paying for a house should take a lifetime thatched roof : former art teacher mr @entity16 taught himself how to thatch in order to create the cottage 's intricate roof welcoming : cob houses are built according to a method thought to date back to prehistoric times which uses only earth , clay and straw isolated : the cottage , situated in the @entity95 countryside , even has its own thatched outhouse complete with composting toilet there is also a woodburning stove , strategically placed beneath the mezzanine level double bed to ensure residents stay ‘ nice and toasty ’ at night , while candles and lanterns provide light			1
the water supply is free as it comes from a diverted natural spring which gurgles out of a pipe outside , while the ‘ natural ’ fridge is a shallow well a few yards away from the front door and hidden from view by towering cow parsley			2
the @entity112 is a composting lavatory in a separate thatched outhouse with a panoramic view of the @entity95 countryside , and the ‘ bathroom ’ is a tin tub hanging on the wall outside which can be brought in and filled as needed			0
hard at work : mr @entity16 spent two years gathering materials and contructing the house at the bottom of his garden site : mr @entity16 intended to build the cottage for no cost at all but after ' some things went wrong ' he ended up spending £ 150 on it taking shape : mr @entity16 said he wanted the house to ' fit in with the landscape rather than intrude upon it ' development : the cottage is built from locally - sourced materials which , apart from the glass , are biodegradable , mr @entity16 has said natural materials : mr @entity16 said that a house ' does not have to cost the @entity2 - you only need earth to build it '			1
the property boasts free running water from a nearby spring ( right ) retreat : the house features the names of all the people who helped in building it written on the wall , including three cows who provided the dung to help build the walls return to where it came from : mr @entity16 says while the house could last forever with proper maintenance , it could also one day disappear back into the @entity2 if it was left tradition : @entity159 cob was traditionally made by mixing a clay - based subsoil with sand , straw and water before using oxen to trample it despite the somewhat @entity167 arrangements , mr @entity16 is renting out the unusual property			1
but there is n’t a hobbit in sight – and the current tenant is a worker on a neighbouring dairy farm who pays for her lodgings in milk and cream			1
cooking can be done on the woodburner , but she has installed a small gas stove in the kitchenette			0
yesterday father of three mr @entity16 , 59 , who lives in a more conventional home nearby with wife @entity186 , 57 , said : ‘ i wanted to show that houses do n’t have to cost anything			1
we live in a society where we spend our lives paying our mortgages , which many people do n’t enjoy			2
’ mr @entity16 originally aimed to build the house for nothing , but miscalculated the amount of straw needed so had to buy more			1
he also had to buy nails to keep the thatch attached			0
friends pitched in to help with the build and their names are written on the wall , along with the names of three cows – @entity208 – whose dung was used to make plaster			0
mr @entity16 , a former art teacher , drew the plans for the house on the back of an envelope and did not need planning permission as it was classed as a summer house			2
homely : @entity216 is provided by a wood - burning stove - and thanks to the cob walls and thatched roof the house is surprisingly well - insulated achievement : mr @entity16 said he wanted to challenge the idea that people had to ' spend their whole lives paying off their mortgage doing something they do n't enjoy '			1

@entity16 used only natural materials or unwanted items to build ' cob house ' at bottom of his garden
he said he wanted to challenge the notion that paying for a house should take a lifetime
he is now renting out the property to a worker on a *neighouring* farm , who pays for her lodgings in milk
