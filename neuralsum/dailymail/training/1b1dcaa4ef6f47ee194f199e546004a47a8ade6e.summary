by @entity0 published : 17:53 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 17:54 est , 18 june 2013 the @entity1 is set to join peace talks with the @entity3 to bring an end to the 12 - year conflict in @entity6 that has cost more than 400 @entity1 lives			1
the @entity8 announced yesterday that negotiations will begin as early as tomorrow with @entity3 representatives in the @entity12 state of @entity13			0
@entity14 gave his backing to the peace plan and revealed that @entity1 has been ‘ fully engaged ’ in the process			1
but @entity19 @entity18 warned the talks could lead to a sell - out that hands southern @entity6 back to the militants who have killed 444 @entity1 servicemen since 2001			1
it also emerged last night that @entity3 killers are likely to be released as a confidence - building measure during the talks			2
they also revealed that @entity1 spies and diplomats are likely to join in if the initial exchanges suggest that a deal can be done			2
under the terms of the arrangement announced yesterday , the @entity3 vowed to break its links with @entity51 terrorists in exchange for a role in running @entity6 when @entity55 combat troops withdraw at the end of next year			2
the @entity3 said yesterday it would not ‘ permit anyone to threaten other countries using @entity6 soil ’			2
the announcement was made on the day that @entity62 handed over control for combat operations to @entity6 security forces in every region of the country			1
the talks in the @entity13 capital , @entity33 , where the @entity3 has opened an office , will also include representatives of the @entity6 government of president @entity73			1
the @entity74 said it would hold talks with the @entity3 at the group 's newly opened an office a senior official with the @entity80 administration said : ‘ the @entity74 will have its first formal meeting with the @entity3 in several years in @entity33 in the next couple of days			1
‘ i would expect that to be followed up within days by a meeting between the @entity3 and the @entity84 , which is the structure that president @entity73 has set up for talks of this nature			2
’ insiders said the first meeting with the @entity3 would simply be an ‘ exchange of agendas ’ in which both sides laid out what issues they wanted to address			0
but @entity74 officials said prisoner exchanges would be one topic for discussion			0
senior security sources say mr @entity14 and foreign secretary @entity100 gave permission for @entity103 officers to begin talking to the @entity3 more than two years ago			0
a well - placed source said last night : ‘ these things do happen			0
there have been contacts on and off for two years			0
there are different levels and natures of engagement			0
‘ @entity6 talking to @entity6 is something we have encouraged			2
this could lead to a positive outcome			0
’ @entity6 president @entity73 speaking today following a security handover ceremony at a military academy outside @entity119 mr @entity14 acknowledged that talks would be ‘ difficult ’ for some to stomach , but he said : ‘ i have long argued that we need to match the security response in @entity6 with a political process to try and make sure that as many people as possible give up violence and give up armed struggle and join the political process			1
‘ that is exactly what i hope can happen with elements of the @entity3			0
that is the point of the @entity3 office in @entity13			0
‘ we have been fully engaged and involved in this process right from the start , indeed from the moment i became prime minister			0
i think this is the right thing to do			0
’ he added that ‘ we can be very proud of what our armed forces have done ’ because the proportion of terror plots against @entity1 emanating from @entity6 has ‘ radically reduced ’ since 2001			1
could newly - announced @entity74 talks with the @entity3 end the conflict in @entity6 after 12 years ? the @entity145 has swelled in size since 2007 , and now numbers more than 350,000 but @entity19 mp @entity148 , who commanded @entity1 forces in @entity150 , warned that the @entity3 holds the ‘ whip hand ’ and negotiators need to ‘ get the talks right ’ or @entity1 forces would have ‘ died in vain ’			1
he said : ‘ the @entity3 are staying , we are going to get out of the game			0
guess who has the whip hand ? we ’ve got to get this right , otherwise we will have lost all those wonderful men and women in vain			0
’ @entity164 of @entity6 , the former counter-narcotics minister , said the country ’s armed forces would not be able to prevent the return of @entity3 control in the south , including @entity172 province where @entity1 troops have been fighting			1
asked if the south will ‘ fall to the @entity3 ’ , he said : ‘ the @entity145 can not control @entity6 for the long term			1
some parts of @entity6 will fall into the hands of the @entity3			1
’ former defence minister sir @entity178 said : ‘ the military have always been clear that there needs to be a political solution , but it is very important that the country is not just handed back to the @entity3			2
’ @entity6 president @entity73 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity62 secretary - general @entity186 ( right ) during the handover ceremony this move could start the process of a full withdrawal of @entity62 troops from @entity6 in 18 months			1

tories warn talks could lead to a sell - out that hands southern @entity6 back to militants who have killed 444 @entity1 servicemen since 2001
