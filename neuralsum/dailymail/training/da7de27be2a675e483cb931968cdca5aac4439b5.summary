friends of a man who has been arrested five times for drink - driving have staged an elaborate prank in a bid to prevent him doing the same again			1
@entity8 prankster @entity7 , of ' @entity9 ' , from @entity10 , @entity11 , decided to take matters into his own hands when his friend passed out after his latest bender			1
using an office mocked up as a hospital theatre , and a team of actors who posed as medical teams , he convinced his pal he had been in a coma for 10 years			2
after first asking his family for permission , he set up the room - including the ' doctors and nurses ' - and woke his friend , the @entity51 reports			2
he even screened fake news reports into the room as his baffled and still groggy victim wakes to the realisation he has been out cold for ten years			1
as he wakes , a ' nurse ' leans into him and tells him he is in hospital and that she is going to get a doctor , who informs him : ' some time ago you were out drinking and you were in an accident			0
the pranksters transform the room into a hospital , with bed , telephone , and television so they can teach the man a lesson once they were told that he had passed out once again , they quickly enacted the plan			1
after he was first transported to the bed , he wakes up to a ' nurse ' who then runs to fetch a ' doctor ' ' this accident took place in 2013			0
' you have been in a coma for the past ten years			0

the doctor arrives in the room and tells him : ' some time ago you were out drinking and you were in an accident			2
