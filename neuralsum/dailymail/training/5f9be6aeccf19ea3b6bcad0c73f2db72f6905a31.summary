the @entity12 were the winners of that first contest above , a picture of @entity12 great @entity69 in action during the second @entity8 at the @entity71 in @entity72			1
@entity69 is one of only five golfers in the sport 's history to have won all four of the current majors			0
hosts @entity45 were 7 - 5 winners of that second contest			1

the @entity12 won 8 - 4 , the first time the hosts had lost in the event the scoreboard is being changed during the 1933 @entity8 at the @entity94 and @entity95			1
just a two - day event back then , victory once more went to the hosts , with @entity45 claiming a win by the narrow margin of six - and - a - half points to five - and - a - half above , @entity12 @entity105 plays out of a bunker during his singles clash with @entity108 at the 1953 version at @entity110			1

below , @entity45 captain @entity92 holds aloft the @entity8 after a seven - and - a - half to four - and - a - half win at @entity117 's @entity116 in 1957			1
however , there then came a period of dominance by the @entity12 you may recognise the man in the above picture - it 's the voice of golf for generations , @entity127 , teeing off on the first hole at @entity129 during the 1965 @entity8			1
this match was typical of many at the time , with the @entity12 making it a virtual non-contest with an 18 - 11 win @entity33 , still widely seen as the greatest golfer of all time , plays a shot on the third hole at @entity129 during the 1969 @entity8			1
right , @entity33 shakes hands with @entity139 after famously and sportingly conceding a putt , to ensure the 1969 contest finished in a 16 - 16 draw			0
it was the first drawn contest in @entity8 history above , a picture of @entity57 @entity146 celebrating after making the first hole in one in @entity8 history at @entity148 in 1973			2
below , one of @entity152 golf 's all - time heroes , @entity36 , celebrating his singles win over @entity35 at the 1977 @entity8 at @entity154			1
this was @entity36 's first @entity8 , and he carried on playing in the contest until 1997 , with 11 appearances in all			2
he also captained @entity10 at the 2008 @entity8 @entity158 , @entity35 and @entity33 pictured during the 1981 @entity8 at @entity159			2
@entity45 and @entity160 were replaced by @entity10 for the 1979 contest , but there was no immediate effect			1
the @entity12 won in 1981 by 18 - and - a - half to nine - and - a - half points			2
the long wait for an @entity12 defeat was ended in 1985 at @entity167			0
right , a celebrating @entity168 holds his arms aloft after sinking a putt to claim a singles win over @entity172 and clinch victory for @entity10 the 1985 @entity8 proved to be a glorious one for the @entity10 , with @entity139 captaining the hosts to victory at @entity167			1
the @entity12 were beaten in the contest for the first time since 1957			0
here , @entity178 celebrates with members of the team - the man spraying the champagne is all - time great and @entity8 hero @entity34			2
in the background is @entity168 and @entity29 the enduring image of the 1987 contest is surely this , @entity188 @entity187 dancing			0
his partnership with compatriot @entity34 proved to be an inspirational one , with the @entity12 beaten on home soil for the first time			0
it was @entity34 that fittingly sank the putt that clinched victory , with @entity10 15 - 13 winners @entity198 became a @entity8 hero in 1989 , making a dramatic birdie on the 18th to beat @entity201 and claim a crucial point for his @entity10 team			1
here , the @entity204 triumphantly walks on to the 18th green at @entity167			0
the overall score was 14 - 14 in that 1989 contest , the second time in the history of the event that the final score was a draw			0
it was enough for @entity10 to retain the @entity8 , the final one of four in which @entity139 was their captain this must surely rank as the single most dramatic moment in @entity8 history , with @entity29 missing a six - foot putt in 1991 that would have clinched a singles win over @entity218 , a 14 - 14 draw and retention of the trophy for @entity10			1
agonisingly for @entity224 's team , the ball slipped past the hole and the hosts could celebrate victory at @entity228			0
it was an event that was at times so bitter , it was given the name ' @entity233 ' three @entity10 giants pictured next - on the left , @entity236 and @entity36 during the 1995 contest at @entity238			2
the @entity10 came from 9 - 7 behind on the final day to claim a famous win by 14 - and - a - half points to 13 - and - a - half			2
on the right , one of @entity10 's most inspirational figures of all time , @entity34 , pictured with the trophy after captaining @entity10 to victory at @entity247 in 1997			0
@entity248 also played in eight @entity8 contests the @entity12 surged back from behind at @entity250 in 1999 to claim a famous victory			1
@entity10 were 10 - 6 ahead after two days , but the @entity12 dominated the early stages of the singles on the sunday and the momentum inexorably swung their way			1
the contest ended in ugly fashion when @entity12 players , pictured here , invaded the green in delight when @entity262 holed a monster putt on the 17th , even though @entity187 still had a putt that could have kept @entity10 alive of all the memorable celebrations at @entity90 , few have matched @entity268 being thrown into the lake at @entity167 after holing the winning putt in 2002			2
@entity268 played in three @entity10 teams , and all of them were victorious , in 2002 , 2004 and 2006			0
the @entity204 will captain @entity10 in this week 's contest at @entity9 the 2006 @entity8 at the @entity275 in @entity160 was most memorable for the contribution made by @entity277 , pictured above , just weeks after the death of his wife , @entity279			1
@entity277 , a popular figure with golf fans , was given a rapturous reception throughout the event , but particularly on the final day when he claimed a singles win over @entity285			0
@entity10 were comfortable winners by 18 - and - a - half points to nine - and - a - half , and in the below picture home captain @entity288 has just celebrated by drinking a pint of @entity291			0

above , @entity294 celebrates after making a crucial birdie on the 16th in his decisive singles clash with @entity297 at @entity298			0
@entity294 's 3 & 1 victory gave @entity10 the point they needed to beat the @entity12 by 14 - and - a - half points to 13 - and - a - half			1
the same margin of victory was enjoyed by @entity10 two years ago in an even more dramatic contest on @entity12 soil			2
@entity187 's team were 10 - 4 down at one stage , but fought back for an incredible win			2
below , @entity309 celebrates @entity311 's clinching putt , with the @entity10 victory christened the ' miracle of @entity314 '			0

this year 's @entity8 is being held at @entity9 in @entity316 , with hosts @entity10 *favourites* to win
@entity10 are going for a hat - trick of wins , their last success coming in the ' @entity323 ' in 2012
the first @entity8 contest took place in 1927 , and for many decades the @entity12 were dominant
a @entity45 & @entity160 team was replaced by @entity10 in the 1970s , and the contests have been thrilling since
