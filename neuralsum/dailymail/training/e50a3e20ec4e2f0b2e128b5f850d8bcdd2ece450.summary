january 2012 @entity10 and @entity10 are found guilty of murder			2
march 2014 @entity16 report suggests one of the officers in the original investigation was corrupt			1
‘ so despite all the stories that we ’ve heard , all the evidence that we ’ve seen and now this [ the @entity16 ] report , not a single officer has been held to account for any of their failings either in relation to institutional racism and now institutional corruption and this goes to the highest level			2
’ mr @entity33 said it was important to establish who had ordered undercover officers from the @entity6 ’s @entity177 to gather information on the @entity10 family			1
he said : ‘ if these officers from the @entity177 were all junior officers , undercover officers … were doing the things that they were tasked to do , the question then arises , well who told them to do that , why was that done and how high up did this go in terms of the information , how was it used ? ’ his comments heaped pressure on former @entity28 chief @entity69 , who yesterday issued a statement denying he had ordered – or even had knowledge of – the spying operation in the late 1990s			1
asked whether he thought any senior officers had committed criminal offences , mr @entity33 said : ‘ yes			0
' i have no doubt about that			0
' we have had our suspicions from the outset			0
‘ what we want to now have is evidence , so that that evidence can now be presented either in the criminal court or in a tribunal ... and those officers either rooted out or to face , as @entity31 wants , criminal prosecution and ... those officers at senior level who made mistakes or otherwise acted improperly , for their heads to roll			1
’ mr @entity11 was an acting detective inspector 16 years ago when he met the police spy to enable him to brief @entity69			1
the @entity149 inquiry into @entity0 ’s murder was preparing to hear final submissions from interested parties – in particular the @entity28			2
mr @entity11 was part of the @entity28 team set up to assess its response to the inquiry hearings , which had inflicted serious damage on the force ’s image and reputation			1
mr @entity11 said yesterday : ‘ i welcome any scrutiny of my role in these events over more than 16 years ago , including in the forthcoming public inquiry			1
’ in 1999 , the @entity75 revealed that not a single police officer would be disciplined over the botched investigation into @entity0 ’s murder			2
the newspaper named five senior officers who had made crucial mistakes yet escaped serious sanction			0
strict rules to prevent police whistleblowers from speaking to journalists should be reconsidered in light of the @entity10 report , mps said last night			1
@entity244 used his controversial report into media ethics to call for a clampdown on press - police relations , with records kept of all meetings			0
@entity251 , chairman of the @entity253 select committee said he was concerned the rules were too stringent and would deter legitimate journalism			0
there are also fears that scandals would remain secret because officers would not be able to go to the @entity259 to expose them			0
confirmation that police spied on the @entity10 family came only because a former undercover officer went to the media			1
calling for a rethink , mr @entity251 said : ‘ the @entity244 recommendations were around the kind of corruption which has been exposed and has led to criminal charges , when the police may have been paid for information			0
‘ but what one wants to ensure is that these measures do not stop legitimate journalistic investigations to expose the kind of practice horrifically revealed in the case of @entity10			0
