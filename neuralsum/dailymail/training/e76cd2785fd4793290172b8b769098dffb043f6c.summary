@entity1 could face a series of ‘ brownouts ’ this winter that would dim household lights , @entity0 admits			1
@entity1 faces its greatest risk of power shortages in almost a decade , following the closure of coal - fired power stations to meet @entity11 carbon targets			2
the gap between winter supply and demand for electricity will be 4.1 per cent – the lowest level in eight years			2
however , this safety margin would be wiped out for some periods in december and january in the event of an extreme cold snap			1
this is , however , before counting backup supplies or increased imports keeping the lights on : a one - in - 20 - years cold snap would see @entity1 fail to meet basic reserves , a report warns today			2
it blamed recent shutdowns including after a fire at @entity39 , @entity40 ( pictured ) the grid has already made emergency plans to keep lights on – including paying factories to turn off machines during peak times			0
energy firms could also be bribed to switch on back - up power stations , under measures that will also be funded by their customers through higher bills			1
nevertheless , the organisation warns it may occasionally be necessary to ‘ reduce voltage ’ – causing so - called brownouts			1
energy experts say this would not only dim the lights but could also interfere with electronic equipment , computers and electric clocks			0
fossil fuels : @entity0 has contingency plans to restart mothballed oil and gas power stations ( file photo ) knocked out : @entity66 power station in @entity68 is due to come back online after a fire last week the problems were detailed in @entity0 ’s @entity72 report , which states : ‘ in the unlikely event that the amount of generation does not meet the amount of demand for a period of time , there are a number of enduring mitigating actions that @entity0 can take			1
’ these could include ‘ voltage reduction ’ , it adds			2
@entity85 of the @entity86 , which represents major manufacturers , said : ‘ there was an obsession early on with being the greenest government ever			0
‘ we all want to see cleaner energy – who would n’t ? – but it is becoming increasingly obvious that we want clean energy at a price we can afford			0
‘ we urgently need to be building new gas fired power stations and get cracking on the nuclear programme			0
’ @entity1 ’s energy crisis has been exacerbated by a series of fires at power stations this year			2
four nuclear reactors were also shut down in august after investigators identified defects			0
@entity0 and politicians insist there is no chance of homes losing power altogether , with energy secretary @entity113 guaranteeing : ‘ there will be no blackouts			1
’ nuclear reactors including at @entity118 , @entity119 , will only return to 75 per cent capacity , the report said however , energy analyst @entity121 , of @entity122 , warned : ‘ the calculations that @entity0 has done are nothing like the worst - case scenario			1
there may be false comfort from this			0
’ he said the @entity0 ’s calculations assume that both nuclear reactors at @entity118 and @entity132 , currently offline for maintenance , are brought back into service before @entity135 – and that there are no calm days on which wind turbines fail to generate electricity			1
he added : ‘ if we see brownouts , what you will notice is the lights going dimmer			0
but it plays havoc with electronic equipment such as computers and electronic clocks			0

gap between capacity and peak demand 4.1 *%* , *narrowest* since *2006/07*
but safety margin would be wiped out in extreme cold snaps during winter
grid could bribe firms to switch on back - up stations , funded through bills
but organisation warns it may occasionally be necessary to ‘ reduce voltage ’
energy secretary @entity113 insisted days *ago* : ' there will be no blackouts '
figures and details *outlined* in @entity0 's annual @entity171
