by @entity0 published : 18:55 est , 19 may 2012 updated : 18:55 est , 19 may 2012 running into trouble : @entity2 carries the @entity4 torch on the first leg of its @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 tour the @entity4 torch began its 8,000 - mile relay around @entity7 yesterday – and was quickly at the centre of a moment of drama			1
as 76 - year - old @entity2 carried the flame for one section of the journey through @entity17 , a man came out of the cheering crowd and attempted to run alongside him			1
but the interloper quickly found himself bundled unceremoniously into a hedge by a metropolitan police officer in grey jogging gear			1
the officer was a member of the torch ’s security team			1
the incident sent out a clear message to anyone planning to gatecrash the relay over the next 70 days before the torch arrives at the @entity33 in @entity34			1
mr @entity2 , a recipient of the @entity35 in 1962 as a helicopter rescue winchman who helped save six people from a shipwreck at @entity40 , was unfazed by the incident			1
his son @entity42 said : ‘ he ’s had a great day			1
’ in a brief statement , @entity44 said : ‘ we can confirm that officers from the @entity48 ’s @entity47 took action to prevent a man from gaining access to the torch - bearer close to @entity40			1
over zealous : the man emerges from the crowd and attempts to run alongside torch bearer @entity2 oh no you do n't : the man is immediately tackled by guards who swiftly get him out of the way taken down : he is thrown to the floor into some hedges and torch bearer @entity2 carries on as if nothing happened ‘ we would like to remind members of the public not to attempt to breach the security envelope			1
’ the first to carry the torch was sailing champion @entity68 , who said it was ‘ one of the more nervous moments in my life ’ after setting out from @entity40			1
the triple @entity4 gold medallist opted to ‘ savour the moment ’ by walking rather than running his allotted 300 metres			1
he stopped regularly to let some of the 3,500 - strong crowd see the flame close up			1
after passing it on to @entity79 girls surf champion @entity80 , 18 , of @entity82 , @entity17 , he admitted : ‘ i did not really want to rush it			2
i wanted to give everyone the chance to touch the torch			1
’ being the first to carry the flame on home soil would be a treasured memory , said @entity90 , 35 , who is aiming to win his fourth successive gold this summer			2
he said : ‘ that particular moment ranks right up there with winning a gold medal			2
state - backed @entity95 has provoked fury by lavishing corporate hospitality on its clients at the @entity99			2
executives from @entity95 ’s investment banking division , which was widely blamed for the bank ’s near - collapse four years ago , will be able to enjoy gourmet dishes and champagne while they watch the events – most of which are sold out to members of the public			2
@entity95 chiefs have purchased tickets thought to have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds from a company which is charging up to £ 7,500 per seat			2
but despite repeated requests by this newspaper , the bank , which is 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer , refused to reveal the cost of the tickets			2
a spokesman said : ‘ it ’s just not something we want to put out there			2
’ another added : ‘ the policy of not talking about the tickets has been decided way above my grade			0
’ last night @entity128 mp @entity127 said : ‘ it ’s an outrageous use of taxpayers ’ money			0
we have bailed them out to the tune of £ 50 billion			0
‘ it is quite unnecessary at the current time and shows that @entity95 is continuing with the sort of old - style extravagance that we saw when @entity138 was in charge			0
’ the £ 7.5 million pavilion where @entity95 bosses will entertain guests is 50 yards from the stadium in the @entity144 in @entity145			0
guests will be offered a gourmet menu as part of the deal with hospitality firm @entity150			0
dishes will include loin of salmon , smoked duck roulade and @entity155 , which costs £ 25 for a 4oz serving			0
four - course dinners are expected to feature seared scallops , wild nettle risotto and saddle of lamb			0
the wine list includes @entity163 , which costs about £ 60 a bottle			0
@entity95 said : ‘ like all @entity7 companies we have been asked to support this historic event and are happy to do so			0
the @entity99 has provided opportunities for us and our customers to do new business together to the benefit of the wider economy			0
’ ‘ it was incredibly special			0
it is one of those moments in your life where you are just in shock			0
at least i did n’t trip over			0
’ after her leg , miss @entity180 added : ‘ this meant the world to me			0
’ today the torch will head towards @entity185 from @entity186 en route to 1,021 villages , towns and cities across the country			1
the flame , lit by the sun ’s rays at a ceremony in @entity196 , @entity197 , last week , will be carried by an average 110 torch - bearers each day			1
the event will end on july 27 when the final runner – still unnamed – enters the @entity33 to light the @entity202 cauldron .			0
