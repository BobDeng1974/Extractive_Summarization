by @entity1 reporter published : 10:51 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 14:07 est , 6 september 2013 a congresswoman who was told that her unborn baby had a fatal condition has spoken of her joy at watching her now thriving baby grow			1
' she is doing wonderful , she is doing amazing , ' @entity7 told today , after her baby was born prematurely and without kidneys			1
tiny @entity11 , who was born in july , only 28 weeks into the pregnancy , may be the only child with @entity12 to have survived			1
optimistic : congresswoman @entity13 and husband @entity14 say their baby who has @entity12 is doing well ' thriving ' : @entity17 , who was born weighing just over 2lb , is making good progress ' i do n’t think there were any physicians who expected , based on her prenatal diagnosis , to ever reach that stage where she ’s simply a growing preemie , breathing on her own , but requiring dialysis , ' dr @entity27 , of @entity28 , said			1
@entity17 's proud parents , who have only recently been able to hold her for the first time , are also delighted at her progress			2
she will scream when her diaper is dirty			0
she is like any other baby			0
she has a few challenges , but man , she ’s determined , ' mrs @entity7 said			1
she and her husband @entity14 had been expecting to find out whether they were expecting a boy or girl when they were first told their baby had a serious condition at their routine ultrasound			2
' it is the worst moment in your life , ' the @entity47 representative said			0
' he was telling us " your baby has no options " ... and at that moment , she was moving			0
she was moving in me , and he is telling me she ’s not going to live			0
' @entity17 has @entity12 , in which impaired kidney function leads to low amniotic fluid during pregnancy , preventing the lungs from developing properly			1
she is having dialysis now and will need a kidney transplant later this year			0
miracle baby : @entity7 and @entity63 can now hold their daughter @entity17 , who was born with a rare and usually fatal condition when her parents were first told there was no hope for their first child , they were faced with an agonizing decision of whether to accept what their doctor told them , or to continue with their pregnancy			1
' they gave us no options			0
it is the worst moment in your life , ' mrs @entity7 said			1
the couple spoke to several doctors before finding a specialist in @entity86 who agreed to try an experimental treatment that involved injecting saline solution into the womb to replace the crucial amniotic fluid that was missing			1
though only 2lb 12oz at birth , @entity17 had fully developed lungs and is breathing on her own , suggesting that the relatively uncommon treatment had worked			1
they were put in contact with the doctor after another parent slipped them a name and said : ' here 's a doctor who might try			2
' mr @entity63 said that like most parents , they were determined to never give up , and has advised families facing a similar situation to find a doctor willing to help			0
he added : ' there 's no guaranteed solutions and there 's no magical cures ... but do n't be satisfied with just one opinion because there 's a lot of intelligent doctors with different perspectives and experiences			1
miracle baby : the @entity118 with their tiny newborn @entity17 when she was just two weeks old rep. @entity7 ( right ) is pictured with her husband , @entity14 , and @entity122 speaker @entity121 during a mock swearing in			1
@entity124 has announced that her unborn child has @entity12 on a @entity127 page announcing the baby 's birth , the @entity118 revealed how they refused to give up on their baby			1
' multiple doctors explained that based on medical evidence her condition was incompatible with life and that , if she survived to term , she would be unable to breathe and live only moments after birth , ' they wrote			1
' we were also told that dialysis or transplant were not possible			2
the options we were offered were termination or “ expectant management , ” that is , waiting for her to die			0
instead , we chose to pray earnestly for a miracle			0
' dr @entity27 , a neonatologist in @entity148 , said he was cautiously optimistic about the baby 's future			0
' despite @entity17 's prematurity , small size and life - threatening disease , she is doing well , ' he said			2
mrs @entity7 , 34 , is a @entity155 in her second term in @entity157 , representing the 3rd district covering the southwest portion of @entity47			2
joyous : @entity7 and her husband @entity14 say they have no reason to believe their daughter ca n't lead a full and healthy life expectant mother : rep. @entity7 , 34 , had announced on may 1 that she was expecting her first child in the fall babies with @entity12 typically die within a couple days of being born , according to the @entity170			1
the condition 's primary problem is when the kidneys , which normally produce amniotic fluid , fail to develop properly as the baby is growing in the womb			2
without amniotic fluid , the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus , which can lead to abnormal facial and limb development			0
the condition may also stunt the development of the lungs			0
the @entity155 had announced on may 1 that she was expecting her first child in the fall			0
the couple wrote that they did n't know what the future held , ' but we ask for your prayers and appreciate the privacy a family needs in such circumstances			0
' ' according to the medical information and advice we 've received , i will be able to continue to balance the responsibilities of an expectant mother with serving as your representative in @entity157 , ' the message continued .			0

@entity7 's first child was diagnosed with @entity12 in the womb
@entity211 is believed to be the first to survive after birth
