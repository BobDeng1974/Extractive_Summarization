by @entity0 when @entity1 was first tipped off that a young man had accused him of rape he appeared relaxed , never believing the claim would be taken seriously like so many gay men of a certain vintage , it was only after the death of his mother that @entity1 had the courage to come out			1
the loss of @entity13 five years ago was a shattering experience for the @entity16 mp			2
but even the grief he suffered then must pale in comparison with the distress he has endured since the @entity22 decided to charge him with nine sex offences against seven men			1
@entity1 remained relaxed when a close friend tipped him off last may that a young man of 22 had made rape allegations against him to the police			1
he never thought for a second it would be taken seriously			2
today @entity1 must know that , even though he ’s been cleared by a jury , his reputation is in tatters			1
the 56 - year - old was portrayed in court as a sad , lonely , middle - aged man with a penchant for sex with men half his age			1
his own assessment to his legal team was simply that ‘ there ’s no fool like an old fool ’			2
while his @entity47 in @entity48 has been steadfastly loyal , some fellow @entity16 @entity46 fear he might not have the stomach to go on after the next election			2
an intensely private man who hid his sexuality for decades , he has been humiliated by the graphic descriptions of his clumsy and often drunken attempts at seduction inside his small constituency cottage in @entity58			2
though he was a popular choice to become the deputy speaker of the @entity61 four years ago , he had to resign from the job to clear his name			2
even if his successor @entity65 , another @entity16 mp , wanted to resign to give him his job back , it ’s not in her gift to do so			2
it is a matter for the @entity61			2
he also faces potential financial ruin			2
the proceeds from the sale of the 80 - year - old family greengrocer ’s business , which were supposed to support his retirement , have gone on legal fees			2
given his @entity78 roots , it is perhaps surprising that @entity1 became a rising star of the @entity16			1
born in @entity80 , he went to the local state school			0
as soon as his head could be seen above the counter , he began working in the greengrocer ’s established by his grandfather in the 1930s			0
@entity1 likens it to the shop in the sitcom @entity90			1
at 17 , he joined the @entity109 when @entity110 became @entity16 leader			0
‘ i always thought it was @entity106 ’s little joke , ’ he once said			0
‘ he made me born in @entity80 and born a @entity16			0
’ he also wryly commented : ‘ it was n’t so much “ the only gay in the village ” as “ the only @entity16 in @entity80 ”			1
’ @entity1 went on to study politics at the city ’s university , but remained troubled by his sexuality , agonising over whether to tell his mother once his father died of cancer			1
‘ there was just no right time			0
i just did not want to upset her			0
i did n’t know how she would take it , ’ he recalled			0
' there was just no right time			0
i just did not want to upset her			0
i did n’t know how she would take it ' - @entity1 on never telling his mother @entity134 he is gay having fought and lost in two safe @entity136 seats in the 1980s , he was selected to fight a by - election in @entity48 in 1991			1
even though he lost , the local @entity138 stayed true to him and he won the seat in the general election the following year			0
when he became an mp , he made a calculated decision to opt for a life of celibacy			0
he was ambitious and , in a @entity16 hostile to the gay community , he decided that pretending to be heterosexual was the best way to advance his career			1
he even voted in favour of a series of measures which were seen to be anti-gay , such as opposing an equal age of consent			0
but by 2000 , the pressures of living a lie became unbearable and he started to ‘ consummate ’ the gay phase of his life			1
at the bar at @entity16 conferences , or in the @entity159 in the @entity61 , he often drank too much surrounded by young male researchers and was known to have wandering hands			0
he often used to sit hand - in - hand on the @entity163 with one of the men who gave evidence against him in court			1
there was inevitably gossip about the amount of time he spent with male researchers often half his age			0
speaker of the commons @entity173 ( left ) called in police after claims were made by a second man			0
it was during @entity179 's ( right ) reign as leader of the @entity138 that mr @entity1 ' shadow cabinet career came to an end			1
there was an insinuation during the court case he was sacked because of his conduct , it was untrue after the election of @entity189 as @entity16 leader in 2001 , @entity1 was made shadow @entity191			1
he contrived to be absent from the vote allowing civil partnerships , missed three votes on gay adoption and in one vote opposed it			2
in 2003 , @entity1 ’s shadow cabinet career ended with the election of @entity179 as @entity16 leader			1
there was an insinuation during the court case from the prosecution that he was sacked because of his social conduct			0
@entity179 was shrinking the size of the shadow cabinet , and the @entity78 portfolio was reduced in stature			0
@entity1 decided to return to the backbenches rather than carry on in a lesser role			1
' i have never come across somebody who was so open and positive about their sexuality			0
i was impressed ' - @entity1 speaking about his attraction to one of his alleged victims in the years that followed , he became more settled in his sexuality			1
ironically , it was a man who had helped @entity1 come to terms with being gay who , in 2009 , told @entity16 whips that the mp had sexually assaulted him			1
@entity1 readily admits he had wrongly assumed there was a mutual sexual attraction , but flatly denies sexual assault , a claim the jury believed			1
speaking during the trial of the attraction he felt towards the young man , @entity1 told the court : ‘ i have never come across somebody who was so open and positive about their sexuality			1
‘ we would sit very closely together			0
my experiences were somewhat more limited than his			0
’ after the allegations were made to the whips in 2009 , no official action was taken , and a year later @entity1 was elected deputy speaker by his fellow mps			1
by that point , his mother had died and , having stopped his late - night drinking sessions in @entity251 , within months he had come out			2
the three years that followed were some of the happiest of his life			0
but everything changed when further claims were made against him by a second man last year , and the commons speaker @entity173 called in the police .			0

@entity1 came out as gay after the death of his mother @entity134 in 2009
he was cleared of nine sex charges against seven men by a jury
while he was acquitted by his peers , his reputation lies in tatters
