@entity0 today announced it is raising wages for 40percent of its 1.3 million employees as the embattled company tries to reshape the image that its stores offer dead - end jobs			1
the company - the biggest private employer in the nation - announced on thursday that it is funneling $ 1 billion into how it pays and trains its workers			1
as part of the changes , entry level wages will be raised to at least $ 9 an hour by april - which is $ 1.75 above the federal minimum wage - and then $ 10 by next february			1
but while the changes are a move in the right direction , they fall far short of demands by labor groups , which have long protested for @entity0 to raise its starting hourly wages to $ 15 and give employees more consistent hours			1
for part - time workers , the hourly wage will be $ 10 , up from $ 9.48			2
that 's below the $ 14.65 average that hourly retail workers in a non-supervisory role earn , according to government data that includes people who work at auto dealers and other outlets that would likely pay more than discounters like @entity0			2
but it 's also above the $ 9.93 average hourly pay for cashiers and low level retail sales staff , according to @entity54 's survey of 140 retailers with annual sales of $ 500 million			0
about 500,000 workers will receive the raises as part of the company 's $ 1 billion investment			1
on thursday , @entity62 , which has long been protesting for the company to give its employees full - time hours and a wage of $ 15 an hour , responded to the news on its @entity68 page			1
' big day for @entity62 ! ' it wrote			0
' today @entity0 responded to our call for higher pay and more consistent schedules			0
they are committing to raise pay for 500,000 associates by raising the minimum pay to $ 9 per hour this year and $ 10 next year and and also raising the floor and ceiling for most current pay bands			1
' this does n't get most of us to $ 15 and ft ( full - time ) but it shows that by standing together and taking action we can make big change at @entity0			1
ongoing battle : people can be seen protesting low wages outside a @entity0 store in @entity90 last november ' today when we go to work let 's tell our co-workers what we have accomplished and invite them to join us in making even bigger change at @entity0			2
' @entity0 follows other retailers that have boosted hourly pay recently , but because it 's the nation 's largest private employer , the impact of its move will be more closely watched			2
in addition to raises , @entity0 said it plans to make changes to how workers are scheduled and add training programs for sales staff so that employees can more easily map out their future at the company			1
' we are trying to create a meritocracy where you can start somewhere and end up just as high as your hard work and your capacity will enable you to go , ' ceo @entity26 told the @entity29 during an interview this week at the company 's headquarters in @entity117 , @entity118			0
the changes , which @entity0 announced on thursday as it reported fourth quarter results , come at a time when there 's growing concern for the plight of the nation 's hourly workers			1
thousands of hourly workers and their supporters have staged protests across the country in the past couple of years to call attention to their financial struggles			2
business groups and politicians have jumped into the fray , debating a proposal by president @entity138 to raise the federal minimum wage from $ 7.25 to $ 10.10 an hour			1
and a new @entity29 - @entity141 poll found that most @entity142 support increasing the minimum wage			2
at the same time , the competition for retail workers is becoming increasingly stiff			0
as shoppers get more mobile savvy , retailers are seeking sales staff that 's more skilled at customer service			0
but in the improving economy , the most desirable retail workers feel more confident in hopping from job to job			0
@entity0 , which has struggled for two years with sluggish sales , follows other big retailers that have announced plans to increase pay for its workers			0
@entity161 home furnishings retailer @entity160 this year gave thousands of workers at its @entity142 division a 17 percent average raise to $ 10.76 an hour			0
and clothing chain @entity165 raised its minimum hourly wage of employees to $ 9 last year and $ 10 this year			1
@entity168 , a @entity169 economics professor who served as an informal adviser to @entity0 during the past year for the program , applauded @entity0 's moves			0
' it 's positioning itself to be competitive , ' he said			0
' this is a step in the right direction			0

@entity0 is spending $ 1 billion to make changes to how it pays and trains its hourly workers in its biggest ever overhaul
it will boost wages for 40 percent of its 1.3 million employees and entry wages will be raised to $ 9 by april - which is $ 1.75 above minimum wage
it has long faced *pressure* from labor groups to raise the starting hourly wages to $ 15 - but the move falls short of their demands
still , labor group @entity62 applauded the company for making a move in the right direction
programs will be rolled out for fixed schedules and hands - on training
