ten reasons to give @entity1 a sliver of hope that @entity4 can catch @entity5			1
ten reasons to disturb @entity6 as he turns his full focus on the @entity8			1
@entity6 has a five - point lead to preserve at the top of the @entity8 and a game in hand if he is to bring the title to @entity14 for the first time in five years			1
what had seemed set to break into a procession at times could yet become a contest if @entity5 can not kick the habit of throwing away the lead			1
it has happened 10 times this season and the unwanted trend has accelerated since the turn of the year			1
@entity24 headed home to knock @entity5 out of the @entity26 in another poor result after leading @entity5 players surround the referee before @entity30 was sent off during the hot - tempered affair @entity6 's side have let leads slip in no less than 10 games in all compeitions this season problems seemed to kick in after the draw against sunday 's opponents @entity39 , at @entity40 's , on 28 december			1
it was a day when @entity6 fumed about penalties not awarded and a ' campaign ' against his team			1
maybe the @entity5 manager had already detected signs of what might lie ahead			1
2014 - 15 : @entity49 @entity48 before @entity50 : @entity52 @entity51 since @entity50 : @entity54 @entity53 games are more difficult after the @entity56 , with @entity58 semi-finals and a final and the first knock - out round of the @entity26			1
fatigue starts to bite with a manager with a small core of players he seems happy to use , which do n't include @entity66 or @entity67			0
yet it is @entity5 's inability to close out many games which will trouble @entity6			1
his teams have consistently boasted this quality , and it remains			0
they closed out the @entity58 final against @entity76 expertly , but seven times in 15 games since the turn of the year they have let a lead slip			1
@entity30 blasts past @entity82 as @entity5 let a 1 - 0 lead slip in @entity84 @entity85 against @entity86 ( left ) , while @entity87 and @entity88 catch up as @entity4 grab a point @entity90 struggles against @entity91 ( left ) as @entity92 looks on against @entity93 @entity88 offers @entity94 consoling words against @entity76 ( left ) , with @entity97 equalising at @entity98 @entity100 fronts up to @entity101 at the @entity102 , with @entity103 celebrating in front of @entity85 it might be more likely to develop into a battle if @entity4 were not misfiring , too			1
@entity107 and @entity93 are in more fluent form but a little further adrift			0
@entity5 are not about to implode spectacularly			1
@entity109 h ( @entity26 ) led twice 2 - 2 @entity110 @entity86 h ( @entity111 ) led 1 - 1			1
@entity109 a ( @entity26 ) led 1 - 1			2
@entity112 ( @entity111 ) led 1 - 1			0
@entity113 ( @entity114 ) led 2 - 0 lost 2 - 4			0
@entity93 a ( @entity115 ) led 1 - 1			0
@entity76 a ( @entity111 ) led 1 - 0 lost 3 - 5			0
@entity116 a ( @entity111 ) led drew 1 - 1			0
@entity4 a ( @entity111 ) led drew 1 - 1			0
@entity117 ( @entity26 ) led drew 1 - 1 over the campaign , they have been easily the best in the @entity8			2
they will probably win the title			0
rather , tiny problems have cropped up where there were none			0
if nothing else , it will keep @entity6 busy in the summer , in his restless quest for perfection			2
he will prioritise another central defender , with @entity132 top of the list , and will work to tighten up a defence which has shown tiny uncharacteristic flaws			0
opposing teams will have noted how @entity138 , amid a brilliant season , has had issues with crosses whipped in , six yards from goal			2
both @entity109 goals were headed in from this region			0
@entity144 was @entity86 's equaliser			2
and @entity4 's equaliser came after he was beaten in such a duel by @entity148			0
@entity138 has started to struggle to deal with crosses whipped into the box , leading to goals conceded @entity85 , battling @entity152 , has not been firing on all cylinders since @entity154 @entity6 will also like to add another defensive option in midfield , for the really big games at the business end of the @entity26			1
missing only @entity160 from his squad , his midfield was dominated by @entity109 and @entity92 , outstanding all season , played at full stretch , his passing not at its best , under pressure against @entity165 , @entity166 and the excellent @entity152			0
the form of @entity85 has been flat since his return from a hamstring injury and when he does n't dazzle he does not have the defensive strengths to satisfy his manager			0
there are games against teams like @entity109 , when @entity6 would like another strong athletic presence alongside @entity92			2
@entity100 has been more noticeable for his physical play and histrionics than his goalscoring ability without the creative flair of @entity85 , the goals have dried up for @entity100 , who may be off the pace because of his ban , as @entity6 claimed , but also seems to be distracted by the need to prove he will not change his physical game to appease those who do n't like it			1
@entity94 shows no sign of losing his mojo but @entity90 's influence has faded through the season and @entity67 does not appear to be trusted			2
so @entity5 expect be in the market for options up front , too			2
@entity6 always says a manager can never be happy and even if , as expected , he goes on to claim the title , he will be busy this summer			2
some people thought he had already built one of the great teams of the modern era , but there is work to do and no - one knows it more than him .			0

@entity5 have let leads slip 11 times this season
@entity6 's side now out of the @entity26
