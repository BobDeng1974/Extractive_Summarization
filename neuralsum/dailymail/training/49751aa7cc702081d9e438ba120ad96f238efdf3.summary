a couple is suing a hospital over the death of their new - born girl @entity3 , after a planned home birth went tragically wrong			1
parents @entity7 and @entity8 , from @entity9 , say they 're lodging the legal action over her death because ' we just do n’t want this to happen to anyone else '			1
they say the publicly - funded home option , which they insist was offered to them by @entity19 , was the reason the birth went wrong			2
@entity3 died almost 11 days later			0
@entity7 and @entity8 are taking legal action over the home birth of the @entity3 the couple claim in a statement regarding the writ lodged in court , that the home birth program offered by @entity19 ' failed us ' court documents show that ms @entity7 's waters broke at 12.15am on january 26 , 2012 , and after calling the hospital they were told the originally assigned midwife was not available and another was on the way			1
the baby was born at about 12.50am with no midwife present			0
that 's when , they say , @entity3 's colour had them concerned something was wrong			1
the couple says they received a text message from the hospital with a phone number for the midwife , which they allege was wrong			1
it 's further claimed that the midwife arrived at 1.25am , by then the documents state , @entity3 was not breathing			1
she died on february 5			0
' there are really basic things that could have been done to make a difference , that mean that @entity3 would be alive			0
that program failed us , ' they said			0
' mostly it was about communication			0
' giving us the right phone number for a start and being on the phone and asking more questions about how the baby was , what she was doing , instead of hanging up and leaving us on our own			0
' that is what should have happened			0
they knew the midwife would take an extended time to arrive and should have advised us or called an ambulance			0
' it was n’t as if we were demanding a home birth at all costs			1
' they say that at about the 20 week mark , the possibility of a home birth was raised with them by the hospital			1
ms @entity7 and mr @entity8 say after the trauma of a quick labour which led to their oldest daughter being born in the back of ambulance , they decided to move back to @entity9 and within close proximity of a hospital			2
' it was n’t as if we were demanding a home birth at all costs , ' said ms @entity7 and mr @entity8			2
their lawyer told @entity98 ' these people are not ideologically tied to home birth , by any stretch ' their lawyer @entity102 of @entity103 confirmed the action against @entity105 had been lodged			1
' they wanted to make it ( the birth ) as seamless as possible , so if they did have a quick labour , they were close to a hospital , ' she said			0
ms @entity102 added that the couple , who have three other children , did enter into conversation with hospital officials immediately after their daughter 's death but were not happy with the explanations they received			1
' they had a meeting with the hospital soon after @entity3 passed away and had to try pretty hard to get it but they were n't satisfied with the answers they received , ' ms @entity102 added			2
' their primary focus is to make sure it does n't happen to another family			2
there are not many of these home birth situations , so it 's certainly a unique set of facts			1
' these people are not ideologically tied to home birth , by any stretch			2
' ms @entity102 explained that the legal action was based on several factors , the allegation the hospital provided them with the wrong phone contact for the midwife assigned to them , that not enough questions were asked about @entity3 's health in the moments after the birth			1
they were further concerned over how long it took for the midwife to arrive at their home			2
' we did what we were told to do and we did everything that was asked of us , we went to all our antenatal appointments			0
there were shortcomings in that service , ' the couple added			0
@entity105 officials told @entity98 they would be making no comment			0
