rival clubs claim @entity1 , facing @entity3 fines of up to £ 50million for multiple breaches of financial fair play regulations , are making an outrageous attempt to get their man on the inside of the discussions			1
@entity3 board member @entity11 ’s departure from @entity12 to become chief executive of @entity14 has created the need for an election for a @entity18 representative as @entity11 can not automatically keep his place			0
@entity18 clubs have been informed that there are two nominations for the vacant seat — @entity11 and former @entity25 director @entity24 , now chairman of @entity26			1
@entity27 , owner of @entity1 , wants to avoid fines of up to £ 50million for @entity29 breaches @entity24 is a sports lawyer whose firm represents @entity1 over their considerable @entity29 troubles @entity1 are 19th in the @entity33 , four points away from escaping the relegation zone @entity24 is a sports lawyer and his firm @entity36 are representing @entity1 over their considerable @entity29 troubles			1
clubs believe that having @entity24 on the @entity3 board , where @entity29 is the hot topic , would be helpful for @entity1 and a massive conflict of interests			1
however , the highly - respected @entity24 , who has a number of sporting directorships including @entity44 and @entity45 , dismissed the conspiracy theory as ‘ wholly ludicrous ’			2
@entity48 ’s stand - off with @entity49 over a new contract is not just to do with him			1
it will suit @entity48 ’s representative @entity55 , who split with @entity53 ’s @entity56 to set up on his own earlier this season , if any new deal is delayed until his parting from @entity53 has been finalised			2
@entity55 ( left ) is @entity48 's agent and is a key player in his contract negotiations with @entity49 @entity48 ( left ) pictured with @entity49 manager @entity60 ( right ) at @entity49 training the five former @entity63 managers who signed the letter supporting @entity66 ’s homegrown players ’ campaign had nothing to do with writing the missive			1
it was the work of the @entity72 ’s support agency on the issue , @entity74			0
certainly , @entity75 and @entity76 did nothing for the homegrown situation when club managers — @entity76 even shut down @entity81 reserves			0
@entity66 , the @entity72 chairman , wants to more homegrown players playing in @entity63 @entity76 's name is one of five former @entity63 managers to sign a letter supporting @entity66 's idea however , @entity88 are at least helping the @entity72 fight the pr battle toe - to - toe against the all - powerful @entity33 , who ironically have used @entity88 for crisis management advice in the past			1
@entity63 cricket head coach @entity93 ’ considerable good fortune at surviving such a @entity96 humiliation extends to the @entity98 board meeting reviewing that debacle being next thursday			1
by then @entity93 will be preparing for the first test against @entity101 starting four days later			2
@entity63 cricket head coach @entity93 ( right ) will soon begin a review into @entity63 's @entity96 failure @entity93 ( left ) oversaw @entity63 's humiliating group stage exit from the @entity96 if the postmortem had occurred earlier it is difficult to see how @entity93 could still be in charge			1
the breakdown in the relationship between the @entity72 and @entity110 led to the offensive chants during @entity63 ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity113 in @entity114 on tuesday			2
the tasteless repertoire of songs ran from ‘ @entity117 ’ , to ‘ f * * * the @entity118 ’ to ‘ f * * * the @entity72 ’ — the last one due to the huge discontent over the decision to switch double loyalty caps from away trips to home games at @entity124			0
those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games			0
the @entity133 , despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting , believe it is inevitable that the songs — and the @entity137 favourites — will be sung when @entity63 play the @entity138 in @entity139 on june 7			2
there were offensive chants made by @entity63 fans during the game against @entity113 in @entity114 on tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved @entity63 's next international is against @entity148 and takes place in @entity139 on june 7 the @entity133 are in no mood to work with the @entity72 because of the caps dispute and claim that , having taken legal advice , @entity155 and @entity137 songs are not law - breaking and that the @entity72 showed no interest when the @entity133 first tackled @entity63 fans singing offensive songs in 2005			1
the @entity72 regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues			0
staging @entity161 games at @entity163 ’s @entity162 rather than the sport ’s @entity165 stronghold continues to be a problem for organisers			0
the loyal @entity163 rugby public want little to do with their football neighbours , whose three group fixtures are a long way from being sold out			0
@entity175 ’s loveable football commentator @entity174 was not happy at being asked to pay city tax on checking out of @entity114 ’s @entity177 after the @entity63 game			2
@entity174 was overheard at reception moaning it was @entity181 ’s responsibility to settle the bill and not his			0
but @entity174 eventually had to cough up … all of seven euros			0
@entity174 ( left ) was allegedly upset at being asked to pay city tax leaving @entity114 after @entity63 played			0

@entity24 is a sports lawyer whose firm represents @entity1
@entity48 's agent has emerged as key player in his contract talks
@entity93 will begin review into @entity63 's failed @entity96 next week
