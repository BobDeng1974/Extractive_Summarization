in his ruling , he said it was not of a ' high standard of design ' , as required by @entity49			0

last may the council served a temporary notice to prevent further building work			0
at the time , cabinet member for the environment @entity103 said : ' as soon as this issue came to the attention of the council , officers visited the site in the company of the owner			2
in order to prevent any further unauthorised development a @entity110 was served			0

nearby resident @entity133 , 65 , said she has complained to the council about the building			0
she said : ' i feel sorry for whoever will live there			0
people should n’t have to live in a space like that , even with the housing crisis			2
' passing by i ’ve seen inside when the doors open and you can see right through to the back garden			0
there ’s no dividing wall			0
it ’s a garage with a loft			2
' it ’s dreadful and it does n’t fit in at all with the other houses			0
' there are 24,000 people on the council ’s housing waiting list and , as of march , just 60 empty homes in the borough , many of which have been allocated already			0
the council is trying to free up space for housing developments by targeting disused garages			0
it has found 159 sites around the borough , and the strategy is expected to create hundreds of homes			0
@entity170 , 64 , who lives opposite the development , said : ' it ’s a bit rough but other than that it does n’t bother me			0
it has n’t been used for years as a garage so why not ? ' there ’s a shortage of housing so everything helps			0
