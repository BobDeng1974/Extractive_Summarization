by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 gave @entity4 ' side the lead in their last 16 clash with a late header			1
click here to view his goal			1
@entity10 would have been an interested spectator in @entity11 on monday			1
he was , of course , keeping an eye on @entity15 striker @entity14 , who was a surprise starter for the clash against @entity17			1
but @entity10 , working for @entity19 tv in @entity20 , would also have been keeping close tabs on @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
the trio are targets for the @entity27 this season			2
@entity30 right - back @entity23 is a more realistic target for @entity10 , as he continues with his attempts to replace @entity33			2
@entity22 is a long - term target for @entity10 , but looks set to sign a new deal at @entity36 , while @entity24 will cost big money to lure away from @entity38			2
@entity39 has been one of @entity41 's stars of @entity20 2014 so far			1
but how did he get away with his reckless challenge on @entity43 that caused the @entity44 to be stretchered off ? @entity45 man : @entity41 's little wizard @entity46 ran the show as ' les bleus ' reached the quarter - finals tres bien : coach @entity4 acknowledges his playmaker after @entity41 sealed the victory engine : @entity39 , surrounded by three @entity44 , was a livewire in central midfield fortunate : @entity39 was fortunate to only be shown a yellow card after a nasty tackle on @entity43 surely , the @entity19 would have been down to 10 men if referee @entity56 had the benefit of a tv replay			1
@entity59 has been a mainstay of @entity17 's defence during the @entity61			1
and perhaps we 'll be hearing more about him next season			2
his performances have alerted a number of @entity67 clubs , including @entity68 and @entity69			2
he currently plays for @entity71 champions @entity70			2
impressive : @entity59 , of @entity70 and @entity17 , was excellent at right - back as @entity17 put up a brave fight eyes on the prize : @entity2 ( left ) scored in the 79th minute for @entity41 from a corner vs @entity17 @entity77 made his 10th @entity61 appearance in @entity11 , a new @entity44 record			1
but the centre - half , who spent the back end of last season on loan at @entity85 from @entity86 , wo n't remember his red - letter day with much fondness as his side crashed out of the tournament and scored an own goal to boot			1
@entity93 's brilliant half - volley in the second half that rattled off the @entity44 crossbar was the sixth time @entity41 have hit the woodwork during the @entity61 - the most of any other team			1
up for it : @entity2 ( right ) rises high at the back post to score for @entity41 at the @entity101 job done : @entity24 ( left ) watches on as @entity77 scores an own goal to put @entity41 2 - 0 ahead close but no cigar : @entity2 ( left ) nearly put @entity41 ahead in the first - half but with a sweetly - struck volley technique : @entity108 midfielder @entity2 is highly - sought after by some of @entity111 's finest clubs @entity19 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity112 - made some important saves to ensure his side did n't fall behind			1
6.5 @entity23 - the @entity30 right - back continued his fine tournament			2
6.5 @entity118 - looks every inch the world class defender			2
7 @entity122 from strength to strength			2
developing a reputation as one of @entity111 's best			2
7 @entity130 - his experience was vital , but struggled at times			0
6 @entity93 - kept things ticking along nicely in midfield and was unlucky with a long - ranger			0
important defensively and offensively for the @entity19			0
7 @entity136 in central midfield and rewarded with his late winner			0
7.5 @entity46 - a workhorse down the right - hand side and his delivery from wide was wicked at times			1
8 @entity22 - shifted out to the left and did n't look happy until moving back inside			0
6.5 @entity143 starter but did n't grasp the opportunity with both hands			0
5.5 subs : @entity24 ( for @entity14 , 62 ) , 7 ; @entity148 ( on for @entity46 , 90 ) , 5			1
subs not used : @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity33 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158			0
@entity4 : changed the game with his introduction of @entity24			0
7.5 @entity17 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity163 - kept his side in the game with some good stops , but question marks over his role in @entity2 's goal			1
6.5 @entity59 - looks a very useful right - back			0
sound defensively and joined in attack well			0
6.5 @entity77 - dealt well with @entity14 but found problems in stopping @entity22 when he moved inside			0
6.5 @entity174 in the tackle and did n't look overawed by the occasion			0
6.5 @entity178 - found difficulty in stopping @entity46 but stuck to his task as best he could			1
5 @entity43 - played an important role in protecting his back - four before being forced off with injury			0
7 @entity182 for the @entity44 's but a tad slow with his passing at times			0
6.5 @entity186 - @entity17 's danger man could n't provide the same impact he did against @entity188			1
6 @entity189 - floated in and out of the match and could stamp his quality on the game			0
6 @entity194 - @entity193 on the ball too much and nearly cost his side on various occasions			0
5.5 @entity198 - a focal point for his side 's attack but did n't cause too many problems for @entity41			1
6.5 subs : @entity204 ( on for @entity43 , 59 ) , 5 ; @entity205 ( on for @entity189 , 89 ) , 5			0
subs not used : @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215			0
@entity216 : watched his side dominate for large periods but could n't break down the door			0

@entity2 puts @entity41 ahead with header
@entity46 pulls the strings for @entity41
@entity163 makes several saves but costs @entity17 for goal
@entity39 lucky to stay on the pitch
