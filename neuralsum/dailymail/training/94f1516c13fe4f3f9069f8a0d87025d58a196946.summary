test case : unemployed people queue outside a @entity3 job centre			1
six jobless people are claiming compensation from job agency @entity6 for failing to get them work six jobless @entity3 people are suing the country 's employment agency for more than £ 1.5 million because they have not found any work			1
in what is set to become a test case which will have widespread implications across @entity18 , all of the group are being supported by the biggest trade union in the country			2
it comes as @entity3 's @entity23 government struggles to cope with a spiralling unemployment rate which currently sees more than 3.2 million without work			0
while most blame president @entity28 's economic policies for this , the six claimants want the equivalent of £ 257,000 each from their job centres			1
they say they have not been provided them with enough leads or interviews where they can impress prospective bosses			0
@entity37 , a lawyer for the claimants , said that a ' breach in contract ' between them and their job centre has ' already been recognised ' in early proceedings			1
last september one of his clients , a 54 - year - old former executive , said he had been forced to work part time delivering papers because he could not find a well - paid professional job			0
despite being registered as unemployed with his local job centre in the @entity51 suburbs for four years , he has received ' only three appointments ' to discuss a job ' despite repeated requests '			1
none have led to any full - time work			0
big money : the workers each want to sue @entity6 for the equivalent of £ 257,000 the @entity60 has since ordered the job centre to ' meet its obligations ' , which should mean showing a more proactive role in helping the man			1
blame game : many blame @entity3 president @entity28 's policies for the country 's current high rate of unemployment mr @entity37 said his client 's case could not be dealt with as a simple administrative manner , so ' we 're using the routine judicial route , with an appeal for compensation ' from the state employment agency , which is called @entity6			2
representatives of the @entity82 trade union and lawyers for the jobseekers delivered their claim for compensation at the @entity6 headquarters in @entity51 at 10am today			1
' if they reject it or fail to respond , we will get the administrative court involved ' said mr @entity37			0
president @entity28 is , like many of his predecessors , committed to creating state - subsidised jobs , which come with generous perks this has led to an expectation among thousands that they should immediately get a tax payer funded job if they can not find one in the public sector			0
but despite the cost of the vastly inflated public sector becoming untenable , @entity3 governments have steadfastly refused to reduce the vast amount of money it takes to employ someone in @entity3			0
with the explosion in the unemployment figures , @entity6 has been unable to cope with the millions seeking work			2
a parliamentary report last month said it was ' too inefficient ' for the task , and said its work should be ' simplified ' by cutting down on red tape			0
if the claimants are successful in their compensation claim , then the case will become of huge interest to other unemployed people in the @entity123 , including those in @entity125 .			2

the group presented their case to @entity6 in @entity51 this *morning*
they claim they have not been presented with enough interviews
lawyers say a ' breach in contract ' by the job centres has been *identified*
