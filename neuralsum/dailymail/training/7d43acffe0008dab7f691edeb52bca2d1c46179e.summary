mr @entity23 added : ' i found out that the @entity8 people had come and said they would take 15 people to fly from @entity64			2
the @entity8 plane was found to have a technical fault on landing at @entity6 which then led to the flight out to @entity2 being cancelled ' they served us lunch and when i came back @entity8 said there were now 50 seats available to fly from @entity64 and they had enough people			1
' mr @entity23 went back to @entity6 via taxi and was surprised to learn that some of the passengers had got onto a flight due to leave that evening despite being told there was no space			1

there is no way we are going to make it			0
