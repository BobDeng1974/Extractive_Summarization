the woman ’s jeans and long coat are similar to those @entity11 was pictured in in the days following the murder and it has been suggested by the @entity24 tv progamme that aired the footage that the two walk in a similar fashion			1
@entity11 said in court that she had spent the night of the murder with her @entity24 boyfriend @entity44 , reading a @entity46 book and having sex			1

@entity77 , the author of @entity78 , which was inspired by the case , said the footage is not helpful to the prosecution or the defence			0
she told @entity40 : ‘ if the prosecution shows someone like @entity4 walking away from the crime scene it 's not helpful			0
for the defence , if there is a video of her anywhere near the house it 's not helpful to them because her alibi is that she was at @entity44 's house			2
