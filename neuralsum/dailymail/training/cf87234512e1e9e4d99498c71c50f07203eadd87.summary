by @entity0 published : 20:59 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 20:59 est , 31 december 2012 @entity1 says @entity2 is misleading the country by claiming to have slashed the deficit @entity2 is ‘ misleading ’ the public by bragging about having slashed the nation ’s budget deficit , a former conservative cabinet minister said yesterday			1
@entity1 said the boast – repeated in the @entity12 ’s @entity11 message – risked fooling people into thinking that the nation ’s debt was coming under control at a time when borrowing is still running at more than £ 100billion a year , because many voters did not know the difference between the debt and the deficit			1
it came as business leaders warned the economy was in danger of reaching a ‘ @entity27 ’ unless ministers slashed red tape and fast - tracked infrastructure projects to boost growth			1
and @entity32 warned that the government was on course to miss the target set by former chancellor @entity36 to halve the deficit – the amount by which the government ’s expenditure exceeds its revenue – by next year			0
mr @entity1 , who was an economic adviser to mr @entity2 in opposition , has persistently called for deeper cuts to both taxes and spending in order to boost the economy			1
ministers now routinely trot out the statistic that they have cut the huge deficit left by @entity32 by a quarter			0
while this is accurate , mr @entity1 said it could ‘ mislead ’ people into thinking the national debt is falling , when it is still rising fast			1
‘ polling shows that many think there have been big spending cuts in the @entity61 and that the debt is now falling , ’ he said			1
‘ the truth is all too different			0
the @entity61 is still running a deficit of over £ 100billion a year			0
‘ current public spending has been increased by this government			1
that means that the @entity61 state is still adding to our debts by more than £ 100billion again this year , or by nearly £ 1,700 for every man , woman and child in the country			0
‘ meanwhile total state debt exceeds £ 1,000billion , excluding the state banks ’ debts , private finance initiatives , @entity79 and various pension items			1
@entity2 repeated his claim that the government is tackling the country 's deficit in his @entity11 's message ' that ’s nearly £ 17,000 per person of debt already racked up			2
all these debts have to be repaid one day			0
‘ this generation is building up debt to live beyond our means , in the hope that our children will come along and be able to pay it back , or be able to refinance it at sensible interest rates			2
’ yesterday , @entity99 , director general of the @entity100 , said dramatic ‘ once - in - a - century ’ measures were needed to head off the threat of terminal decline , adding : ‘ support those businesses that are looking to venture into new markets by improving access to finance and reducing red tape , and focus on the businessmen and women of the future			2
otherwise it could be a case of too little , much too late			0
’ a @entity114 spokesman insisted the economic programme was ‘ on the right track ’ , with more than a million jobs created since 2010			0
he added the chancellor had outlined a growth package , including tax cuts for 24million basic - rate payers .			2

@entity1 says national debt is still rising fast
prime minister is in danger of ' misleading ' the public
deeper cuts to both taxes and spending needed , he argues
