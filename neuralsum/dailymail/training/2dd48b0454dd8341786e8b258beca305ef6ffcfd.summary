by @entity0 published : 21:10 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 21:10 est , 8 december 2012 @entity1 had the guts to tell it as it is last wednesday			1
we are a trading nation			1
every market to which we sell has its economic problem : @entity10 has a fiscal cliff , @entity12 and @entity13 are both slowing , @entity9 is mired in debt			1
searching for silver linings in such a cloud - laden sky as though we live in an economy divorced from the rest of the world is for the naive or the deceitful			1
hard road to recovery : @entity0 , a former deputy prime minister , is adamant there are no quick fixes to solve the country 's economic problems recovery will be slow as consumers live within their means , banks rebuild their balance sheets and governments get a grip on public extravagance			1
in team @entity36 , we have one of the most determined drivers of strategic growth i have seen			1
this is no flash - in - the - pan gesture or packet of gimmicks			1
this is a government prepared to argue for a strategy for the nation , and much more important , actually do something to implement it			1
chancellor @entity1 has set his face to the wind			1
@entity51 is tackling a country of educational underperformance			1
@entity54 is talking about dependency as though he understands it			1
unlike @entity58 , they are all determined to reduce the levels of debt			1
for there is no serious long - term future for our economy that does not grip the scale of indebtedness			1
leadership : chancellor @entity1 showed guts by not shying away from the difficult decisions needed to set the country on the road to recovery there is no more money , as the outgoing @entity58 chief secretary honourably admitted as @entity58 lost the election			1
nothing has changed – except the official @entity58 line that the economic law of gravity has somehow ceased to exist			1
listening to @entity80 on economic policy has all the coherence of consulting the undertaker before the doctor has called			1
you can not borrow your way out of debt – everyone in the real world knows that			1
so we have to get better value from what we can afford			2
that is the message of my report , @entity98 , which aims to reverse a century of centralisation			2
mr @entity1 has endorsed its localist thrust to revive the local initiative and drive of earlier centuries that made us what we are			2
switching money from departmental administration budgets into building schemes is the right way to go			2
taking cash from bureaucracy and channelling it into house - building , schools and science will create jobs now and provide long - term stability			2
rather than ministers and civil servants in @entity123 saying to places such as @entity125 and @entity126 , ‘ you can have this much for roads , this much for housing , this much for waste ’ , ask those places : ‘ what would you spend it on ? ’ it ’s truly transformational			1
folly : listening to shadow chancellor @entity80 ' economic policy of borrowing your way out of a debt crisis would be disastrous it gives me great encouragement that mr @entity1 said on wednesday that he agrees with that idea and will work up plans in next year ’s @entity140 to achieve it			1
the confidence of a government to turn to someone outside and ask for their thoughts			2
not just anyone , but me			2
the fact is i come with baggage – i have previous , as some would say			2
but that baggage – my 40 years in @entity153 and my 60 years running my own business – has taught me there is another , better way of doing things			2
we are far too over-centralised in the @entity160			1
in the @entity10 , they have the states , in @entity163 the departments and in @entity165 the länder			2
we have no comparable system of real local power , influence and decision - making			2
the chancellor also gave the green light to my suggestion that local enterprise partnerships receive money to develop growth plans for their areas			0
green light : chancellor @entity1 gave the go - ahead in his @entity180 to @entity181 , which will rejuvenate the economy in hard hit areas of the country leps are led by local business people and are a partnership with local government			0
they have thus far relied largely on goodwill , but will now be funded by government to spend two years looking at strengths they wish to build on and weaknesses they wish to overcome			0
just imagine – 39 teams right across @entity197 , beavering away to identify how high streets and businesses can flourish			0
mr @entity1 announced further money for the @entity201			0
to find extra cash for it at such times of economic prudence is a sign of its remarkable success			0
it is delivering long - lasting private sector jobs in the places that most need them			0
the fund is underpinned by all the things i believe in – that government should ask local people for their ideas rather than dictating to them from @entity123 ; that wealth creation should be a joint venture between the private and public sectors ; and that if you make the allocation of public money a competitive process , the amount of match - funding you can lever in from the private sector is staggering			0
hope for growth : under prime minister @entity230 , pictured during a visit to a car maker in @entity233 , and chancellor @entity1 the country has determined drivers for strategic growth there were , of course , things the chancellor did not say i would have liked him to , but i am heartened to hear a full response to my ideas will come in the spring			0
i hope that response will say more about local business support			0
there is little point giving more money , and influence over how it is spent , to our towns and cities if there is not an environment in which firms help each other to get ahead			0
if you are interested in exporting , you need to be able to speak to someone who has been doing it successfully for years			0
if you want to take on apprentices , you need the advice of a firm that already has dozens on its books			0
none of this is rocket science but it ca n’t happen by chance			0
all of our major competitors have sophisticated local business support , yet ours is too fragmented , or non-existent in places			0
the chamber of commerce in @entity274 has 350,000 businesses as members , whereas @entity277 ’s has fewer than 3,000			1
we must do something to remedy that			0
we can not make firms sign up to chambers , so why do n’t we make them attractive bodies that people want to join ? to that end , i suggest letting chambers deliver services that currently sit in @entity153 and its quangos			0
part of the reason we have fallen behind in the global race is that too often people think growth is someone else ’s problem			1
whether it is @entity153 departments not seeing how they contribute to wealth creation , local authorities obsessing about social provision , or coasting businesses not doing more to increase their performance , we all can – and should – do more			0
governments do not have all the answers			0
as a conservative , i have never believed they could do			0
but only the government can empower us to find those answers ourselves			0
i hope that in their full response in the spring , this government will take the opportunity to do just that .			0
