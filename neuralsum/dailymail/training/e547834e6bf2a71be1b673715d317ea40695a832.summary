cleared : @entity0 won a fight to clear his name after being accused of speeding a taxi driver has overturned a fine for doing 50mph in a 30mph zone by using speed camera images to prove he was actually going at only 18mph			1
but @entity0 must still pay hundreds of pounds in costs , despite winning his long legal battle			1
mr @entity0 had been shocked to receive the fixed - penalty notice as he remembered at the time he had been carrying a passenger in her 80s and was driving with extra care			1
determined to clear his name , he appealed against the £ 60 fine which was imposed after he was ‘ caught ’ by a fixed - speed camera in @entity19 , @entity20 , in february last year			1
the father of two , from @entity22 , hired a specialist motoring offences lawyer			0
his battle dragged on for 11 months , until earlier this week the case was dropped moments before a court hearing was due to start			1
using simple maths , two pictures taken by the @entity30 speed camera showed mr @entity0 had been well under the speed limit			1
the images were taken about half a second apart over a distance of four metres marked by white lines on the road – proving his speed was 17.8mph			2
mr @entity0 ’s case was due to be heard at @entity41 ’ court on monday but was dropped when the prosecution looked at the photographic evidence and agreed there had been a mistake			1
but mr @entity0 is entitled to claim only about three - quarters of the £ 1,600 he spent on his solicitor , due to a cap on hourly legal fees that may be claimed in motorists ’ cases			1
when lawyers charge more than the hourly rate , the client has to make up the shortfall			0
the cap on rates was lowered from october 1 , after mr @entity0 set his appeal process in motion			2
but mr @entity0 , 47 , refused to let the expense take the edge off his victory			2
faulty : this speed camera in @entity19 , @entity20 , overstated the speed mr @entity0 was driving by 32mph he said yesterday : ‘ some other people may have just taken the medicine and accepted it , but i was innocent			1
‘ it was nice to walk into court innocent , leave court innocent and be completely vindicated			0
’ @entity70 , of @entity71 , which represented mr @entity0 , said : ‘ nobody knows if there was a fault with this camera			2
‘ we have speculated that it might have taken a reading from another vehicle or another object			0
i have seen similar errors in the past but never one as bad as this			0
’ last year it emerged the number of active fixed speed camera sites in @entity87 had increased from 2,188 to 2,331 in a 12 - month period			1
the number is set to increase , due to plans in a @entity91 report earlier this month			2
the vast majority are @entity30 cameras , a @entity95 brand			0
a @entity97 spokesman said cameras were calibrated annually by the manufacturer and data and images were checked by @entity102 staff before fixed - penalty notices were issued			0
she said : ‘ in this case a fixed penalty notice was issued in error			0
‘ however , we were not notified this ticket was being challenged until monday morning			0
‘ the file was then reviewed and we supported the withdrawal of this case			0

@entity0 accused of driving at 50mph down road he knew well
in fact he was going at just 18mph as he was carrying an *elderly* passenger
managed to clear his name after 11 - month battle but still faces legal bill
