@entity1 's target for 2015 is all too obvious : a return to the top flight			0
and he was provided with further confidence that his @entity6 side have what it takes for promotion with the kind of convincing display that has been expected of them during his 14 - month tenure			1
@entity16 ’s own goal before the break and a @entity19 header shortly after half - time ensured @entity21 were never in this contest			1
it was a night for @entity6 fans to savour as they enjoyed a seventh straight home win over their old rivals in front of a season ’s best crowd of 31,690 , even more than watched the recent defeat to @entity31			1
@entity16 looks on in despair as his attempted clearance flies into the @entity21 net derby youngster @entity35 ( 19 ) watches his low cross deflect into the @entity21 net the @entity21 defender puts his head in his hand after gifting @entity6 a 1 - 0 first half lead @entity6 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity41 6 ; @entity42 7 , @entity43 7 , @entity19 7 , @entity44 6 ; @entity45 6 , @entity46 7 ( @entity47 6 , 80 ) , @entity35 8 ; @entity48 7 ( @entity49 90 ) , @entity50 7 , @entity51 7 ( @entity52 90 )			1

@entity21 had beaten @entity6 2 - 0 at @entity90 earlier this year but their evening got off to a bad start as left back @entity64 injured himself tackling @entity93 and he was replaced by @entity65 with just eight minutes on the clock			1
@entity6 had the better of the play but this game lacked much in the way of clearcut chances early on with @entity71 seeing an effort blocked for the visitors while at the other end @entity35 was also denied by a firm @entity21 defence			2
on - loan @entity103 winger @entity51 was not punished despite going down easily in the area while @entity66 curled wide from distance and @entity70 went close for @entity21			0
but they went on to concede in calamitous fashion on 40 minutes			0
@entity35 burst down the left and his low , teasing cross struck @entity62 and then hit @entity16 before beating @entity60 via the crossbar			2
it was the second game running that @entity21 had conceded an own goal			0
@entity35 celebrates after seeing his cross result in a @entity16 own goal in the 41st minute @entity19 steers his second half header towards the @entity21 goal to put his side into a 2 - 0 lead @entity19 is mobbed by his @entity6 team - mates after putting his side into a commanding lead and up until that point they had been more than in the game			1
@entity6 were buoyed by the goal and could have extended their lead before the break			1
captain @entity43 ’s header from @entity46 ’s free kick was well saved by @entity60 before @entity51 shot wide from the edge of the area			0
the game was as good as up for @entity21 at the start of the second half though			0
@entity19 strained to reach a @entity46 47th - minute free kick but got his head well to the ball to leave @entity137 well beaten			2
it was his first goal since november 2013 but he still received more red cards this season – two – than he has found the net			0
things looked like they would get even worse for @entity21 with confidence visibly draining out of them			0
@entity51 went close to @entity6 ’s third as his long ranger was pushed away by @entity60			2
chances kept coming for @entity6 as @entity21 wilted despite their fanatical support and @entity51 headed wide from another pinpoint @entity42 cross but the fact it was not total humiliation will at least give @entity21 ’ fanatical supporters something to cheer			2
@entity19 bagged his first @entity155 goal of the season during the 2 - 0 win against @entity21 @entity65 ( left ) and @entity46 battle for the ball during the first half on tuesday night @entity6 boss @entity1 looks on as his team stroll to another @entity155 victory			1

@entity16 puts into his own net to give @entity6 first half lead
@entity19 *doubles* home side 's lead shortly after half - time
derby up to third in the @entity155 table after 2 - 0 victory
