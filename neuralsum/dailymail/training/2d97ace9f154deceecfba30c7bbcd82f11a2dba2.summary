an @entity1 judge ordered the state to return 11 exotic animals - six tigers , a black leopard , lion , @entity8 bear , liger , and bobcat - to an animal sanctuary only hours after they were taken away			1
judge @entity13 issued an injunction yesterday ordering that the animals should be returned to owner @entity17 's farm at @entity18 for their safety			1
the state had tranquilized and transported the animals to a holding facility near @entity23 after @entity17 was denied a permit to keep them			1
a wolf hybrid that lives on @entity17 's property was not seized because state law does not prohibit that type of animal			1
owner @entity17 hoped to keep the animals after volunteers helped him improve his facility state veterinarians at the facility will evaluate the animals to determine if they are ready for the 130 - mile return trip			1
it 's unclear when they will be brought back to @entity48			0
@entity49 , an @entity50 spokeswoman , said : ' we 're not going to transport them until they 're safe			0
' she added it 's possible the state could also look into other legal options			2
' they should n't have been taken in the first place , ' @entity17 said after the injunction was granted by @entity61 , according to the @entity62			0
' i should have had a hearing and i never got one			0
' ' today , the @entity1 @entity50 did the right thing by seizing the wild animals at @entity35 who have been held illegally and long neglected			2
now , it 's been reported that the animals will possibly have to endure the stress of being tranquilized again and moved back to the roadside zoo â€” a potentially life - threatening move			2
this is a selfish stunt to prevent the animals from being sent to a sanctuary where they would finally receive the care that they so desperately need			2
@entity80 is calling on the facility to do the right thing and allow these animals to enjoy a peaceful life at a reputable sanctuary where their needs would come first			1
' source : @entity87 @entity17 has been fighting to keep the animals since october , when the state said he needed to surrender them because he had failed to get the necessary permits to keep them			1
if he did not voluntarily surrender the animals they would be taken from him by the state , it said			1
in order to obtain a permit , owners are required to pass a background check , pay fees , obtain liability insurance or surety bonds and show they can properly contain and care for animals			1
regulators denied @entity17 's permit because it was filed late and an inspection found that the facility 's fencing was not adequate , some padlocks and chains were not secured and some cages had exposed metal that could have harmed the animals			1
however , volunteers have helped @entity116 make improvements at the farm			0
exotic animal owners in @entity1 were required to obtain a permit after dozens of wild animals were released by a suicidal owner at his eastern @entity1 farm in @entity123 in 2011			1
authorities hunted down and killed most of those animals , among them black bears , bengal tigers and @entity130 lions			1
@entity17 's daughter said the family is ' not going to stand for it			0
' @entity134 added : ' we 're going to fight it to the end			0
we 're not giving up			0
' a hearing on a permanent injunction stopping the seizure of the animals is set for february 10			2
@entity143 's deputies shot 48 wild animals - including 18 rare bengal tigers and 17 lions - when a suicidal owner released dozens of wild animals from his eastern @entity1 farm in @entity123 in 2011 a sign posted on @entity151 warned drivers of animals on the loose in the area around @entity123 in 2011 a petition has been started on @entity156 urging @entity1 governor @entity157 to help keep @entity35 open			1
it reads : ' @entity17 of @entity160 [ sic ] exotics has been home to many , many exotic big cats			2
' he has been open free of charge 365 days a year for over 20 years			0
' he has been @entity50 licensed since 1989 and has provided a safe and healthy environment for the animals			2
we are in need of all the public support to fight this			0
' this is not some road side zoo , this is a place where thousands of people have brought their families to see some of the most beautiful creatures on earth			0
' these animals are well taken care of , and have never harmed anyone			0
' we just want them to be able to finish out their lives at home where they belong			0
' the animals are in extreme danger of being yanked from the only home they have ever known to be either killed or placed in another facility no better than ours			1
' almost 4,100 people have already signed the petition			0
tigers featured in the @entity196 film @entity194 were born at @entity48 , according to the farm 's official website .			0
