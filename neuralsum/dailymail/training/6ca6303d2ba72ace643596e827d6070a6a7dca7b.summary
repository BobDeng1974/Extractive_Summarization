an ash cloud crisis even worse than the @entity3 eruption , which grounded thousands of flights four years ago , could be possible , scientists have claimed			1
the warning comes after the discovery that volcanic ash has travelled from @entity8 to @entity9 - overturning previously held assumptions about the distances deposits could drift			1
it is the first evidence that ash clouds can travel across the vast @entity14			1
it is the first evidence that suggest ash clouds ( stock image shown ) can cross the @entity14			1
this could mean airways are more susceptible to volcanoes than first thought dr @entity26 , from @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , who helped conduct the research , said it could have major implications for the aviation industry			2
he said : ' the usefulness is the awareness that such a thing can happen			0
' airlines are always interested in risk management			0
this allows them to be better prepared for such eventualities			0
' on monday , @entity8 's most active volcano began to calm down			2
it began spewing ash 35,000ft ( 10,700 metres ) into the air over the weekend , but scientists said the volcano has a pattern of prolonged eruptions of varying intensity and they 're not ready to consider the explosion over			2
@entity49 began erupting on wednesday 12 november , culminating with a major blast on saturday that lasted eight hours before its seismic activity dramatically dropped			0
the @entity52 warned aircraft to avoid the area over the weekend because of the ash plume			0
academics have traced ash found in sites across @entity59 , including @entity60 near @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity9 to the so - called @entity63 resulting from the eruption of the @entity8 volcano , @entity66 , in @entity67			1
@entity69 ' fingerprinting ' was used to match the @entity63 to tephra layers - material produced by volcanoes - in @entity9 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
for 20 years it was believed these layers had come from @entity3 - the source of most ash in @entity59			2
in 2010 , plumes spewed out by the volcano @entity80 in @entity3 caused major disruption and grounded over 100,000 international flights , costing airlines more than £ 2 billion ( $ 3.1 billion )			1
volcanoes like @entity66 in @entity8 are much more volatile and are scheduled to erupt on average every 100 years , increasing the risk of another ash cloud drama with consequences for transatlantic as well as @entity59 travel			1

the latest findings suggest a similar disruption from another volcano may not be as unlikely as thought dr @entity26 , from @entity102 's @entity101 , added : ' if this was to happen again , which is not improbable , it would have massive implications for airspace			2
' this is a very large area and is very busy with travel			0
there could be large - scale disruption			0
' the findings were made by @entity17 scientists in partnership with an international team of academics and have been published in the journal @entity118 researchers also speculate that other tephra layers from similar transatlantic eruptions may yet be uncovered in other @entity123 sites .			0

scientists found that recent volcanic ash had travelled from @entity8 to @entity9
it is the first evidence that suggests ash clouds can cross the @entity14
this could mean airways are more susceptible to ash than first thought
the 2010 eruption of volcano @entity80 caused major disruption
another ash cloud could have similar consequences for transatlantic , as well as @entity59 travel
