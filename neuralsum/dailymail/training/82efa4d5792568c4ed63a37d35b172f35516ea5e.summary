@entity0 remembers an expression @entity2 used during his time at @entity4			1
‘ too much water kills the plant , ’ remarked @entity2 when @entity0 asked why he eased off in the final two sprints of an eight circuit session put on by @entity4 ’s coaching staff			1
the player knew his body			0
he had done the hard yards in 2006 , returning from the @entity13 in @entity14 ripped			0
the stories of @entity2 in the gym performing thousands of sits ups or press ups a day , at @entity4 and with @entity19 , are legendary			1
@entity2 ( right ) showed off his well - honed physique after scoring in the @entity22 final that body has come as a result of the amount of training @entity2 ( right , stretching with @entity26 ) puts in @entity27 warms up in @entity28 after being named on the @entity30 bench after complaining of fatigue @entity0 admits it opened his eyes to new methods , a different way of approaching fitness work after working his way through various academy teams at @entity40			1
‘ i 'd always been brought up to believe that every single minute of every day was a fight and that you had to battle continuously , even in training			2
‘ but though he ( @entity2 ) would work hard , he would train with efficiency			2
’ @entity30 ’s head coach @entity45 is old school and he has admitted on a number of occasions that he has no interest in statistics			1
this is a mistake , particularly when @entity30 bring in some of the leaders in their field to analyse the squad on international duty			2
these days they are not just tracking positions on the pitch			0
the sports scientists in the @entity30 set - up take saliva tests first thing in the morning from each player to check if they have slept properly			1
they know the results within minutes			0
stay up late into the night on the @entity65 or @entity66 and the experts will know about it when they stick a nitric test strip into the mouth of each player when they meet for breakfast			0
they test a player ’s cortisol level , an indicator of stress , as part of the analysis			0
burning the midnight oil , being stressed or anxious about a situation , activates the cortisol hormone			0
on the field , heart rate monitors on each player during every training session are downloaded at the end of training and will tell @entity30 ’s management team if anyone is being overloaded			1
that is the modern way , but by far the most important person to listen to is the player himself			0
@entity27 knows his body better than anyone			2
by flagging up his personal thoughts on the day of @entity30 ’s final training session before they travelled up to @entity97 , it seems @entity27 probably talked himself out of the team			1
it was a little naive , particularly when stories abound about the sacrifices players made in the past to pursue a career in the game			0
for example , in the early days of @entity107 ’s career at @entity108 , when no - one recognised him ( or certainly would n’t dream of ratting on him ) , he would turn out for his uncle ’s sunday side in @entity114 , west @entity115 , the day after a reserve game			2
@entity45 speaks to @entity117 on saturday , but the forward probably talked himself out of the @entity30 team @entity27 ( second right ) sat on the bench for 64 minutes of @entity30 's victory over @entity97 when @entity2 was the same age @entity27 is now , he had played eight more matches			1
the @entity126 man would do well to follow the @entity128 's example @entity2 : @entity130 ( 25 ) , @entity26 @entity129 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 & @entity134 ( 34 ) , @entity26 full national team ( 18 ) , @entity4 ( 60 ) 137 matches @entity117 : @entity126 ( 87 ) , @entity137 , @entity131 , @entity138 , @entity133 ( 31 ) , @entity30 full national team ( 11 )			1
129 matches there are numerous examples from bygone eras of players representing school sides on saturday morning before turning out for a men ’s team in the afternoon			0
there will be sportsmen in other disciplines who will be surprised that a 19 - year - old footballer is prepared to approach his manager and admit to being fatigued			0
take @entity153 , for example , a tennis player who , like the majority of players working at the elite level , relies on explosive power in short bursts to cover his working area			2
listen to him talk about his sessions with physical trainer @entity163 and perhaps football has some lessons to learn from athletes who are the top of their game in other sports			2
writing in his book @entity153 , he talks about his training regime one or two days before match			1
‘ there was another thing @entity175 was emphatic about : that we should stick to the training regime even when i least felt like it , when i was tired or in a bad mood or , for whatever reason , just not feeling up to it			0
video courtesy : @entity183 / @ @entity184 _ @entity153 , pictured in the @entity186 open earlier this year , practises for between four and six hours a day ‘ there were days during a tournament when i would not be feeling at my best either and by training in such circumstances i ’d be better prepared to compete when i was below par. ’ @entity153 practises , including gym and court work , for anywhere between four and six hours a day , depending on his schedule			1
if you apply @entity153 ’s training principles to the @entity30 team then @entity27 had very little to complain about when he spoke with @entity45 on saturday morning			1
perhaps @entity27 is unaware of the sacrifices sportsmen make in other fields , but he paid the price for his honesty			0
@entity45 himself is an inflexible type and he will be very much of the mind that every @entity30 cap has to be earned by the players in his squad			1
after this , it is down to @entity0 to turn mediator			0

@entity2 does thousands of press - ups or sit - ups a day
@entity30 's sports scientists take saliva to see whether stars have slept well
@entity27 was possibly naive in his *conversation* with @entity45
footballers could learn from the training stars such as @entity153 put in
