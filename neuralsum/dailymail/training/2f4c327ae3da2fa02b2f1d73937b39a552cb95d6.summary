by @entity0 @entity1 , hit or myth against the @entity3 ? the @entity5 motormouth with the jumbo - sized talent and an ego to match says he has no intention of ever playing in this country			1
perhaps that has something to do with @entity1 ’s scoring record against @entity3 club teams			1
@entity15 fans might like to grasp hold of these statistics and pray that the trend continues in @entity19 tonight			0
he has seen a total of 1,310 minutes match action but scored just three times			2
breaking that down , the world - class forward only nets once every 437 minutes against @entity42 opposition			0
also , it helps if the opposition is @entity26			0
all three goals have come against @entity47 ’s teams , a double in 2010 for @entity22 and the other for @entity50 in february 2012			2
it would be fair to say that @entity1 has under - achieved , pretty much from the moment he faced @entity26 as a fresh - faced kid for @entity54 in 2003			1
four meetings with @entity56 in @entity58 and @entity59 shirts have drawn a blank , ditto two fixtures against @entity61 , and two games against @entity63			0
at the double : @entity1 netted twice for @entity22 away at @entity26 in the 2010 @entity25 getting used to them : the @entity5 notched against the @entity66 in 2012 while at @entity50 as well @entity68 vein of form ? the enigmatic striker has scored three in his last five games against @entity3 opposition after 10 matches without a goal , @entity1 will argue that he is on a roll with three in the last five			1
he may not have had the goals to showcase his sublime skills but @entity15 manager @entity78 is adamant that the player he had at @entity59 would be a huge asset to the @entity42			2
@entity1 says no. but @entity27 loves a mean , moody , larger - than - life character who can play a bit			1
think @entity84 , think @entity85 , think @entity86			0
hero or villain , football fans throughout the country would love to see another big , controversial personality strutting his stuff on the domestic stage			0
take a bow ! the 32 - year - old scored a sumptuous overhead kick for @entity98 against @entity27 in 2012 wishful thinking ! @entity78 claims it was a pity that the player never plied his trade in the @entity42 sadly , at the age of 32 , the clock is ticking down on @entity1 ’s peak years			1
even he has suggested that this might be his last chance for @entity25 glory			0
having said that , he has been in awesome form this season			1
his total of 40 goals is a club record at @entity28 and he has netted 10 times in seven @entity25 appearances , including four against @entity115			1
finally , and @entity15 supporters might like to look away now , @entity1 certainly has no problems with the @entity27 national side			2
go back to november 2012			0
four goals , including the 2013 goal of the year with that bicycle kick .			0

@entity5 striker has scored three goals in 15 matches against @entity3 sides
but @entity1 is in top form this season *...* *bagging* 40 goals already
