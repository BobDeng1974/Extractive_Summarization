by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 sir @entity2 was something to everyone ; the grandfather of the game , a father figure to his players and the son of a proud @entity10			1
his death was mourned but his life celebrated , every tear dried with a smile			1
five years on , his legacy is tangible in the form of the sir @entity17 , the brilliant charity which has raised £ 7.3million for cancer research , treatment and care			1
his popularity , however , is everlasting , the memories make sure of that			2
italia 90 , of course , came some years before his success at @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , but it is the image of @entity2 dancing on the touchline in the wake of @entity55 ’s winning goal against @entity56 which remains his most overriding ; bronzed skin , silver hair , gold standard			1
@entity39 ’s joyous journey to the semi-final in @entity63 triggered the explosion of football ’s popularity and its appeal to a new generation , not , as many would have you believe , the birth of the @entity71			1
special : @entity2 cared , not only about his players , but every supporter who walked through the turnstile former @entity50 goalkeeper @entity75 took to @entity76 to pay tribute to his former boss , writing : ' 5yrs ago today we lost not only a great manager but a great man too			1
his tremendous legacy lives on through the fantastic @ @entity84 ' prior to this summer ’s @entity86 , a television feature asked @entity39 ’s players for their @entity39 hero – to a man they replied ‘ @entity89 ’ , the star of 1990			1
@entity89 , however , attributes everything to @entity2			1
‘ he was like a second dad , a phenomenal human being , ’ he once said			2
the sir @entity95 at @entity94 recreated the semi-final between @entity39 and @entity97 and came just five days before @entity2 ’s death			1
@entity101 and in a wheelchair , it was his final appearance in public			2
until the end , however , his first thought was football and the players he had nurtured			2
on his way home from the game he asked , ‘ how was @entity89 ? how did @entity89 do ? ’			0
honoured : the sir @entity2 statue stands proudly outside @entity50 's stadium @entity2 cared			1
another @entity89 anecdote springs to mind			0
the night before that semi-final against the @entity117 , @entity2 ’s star midfielder was missing			1
the manager tracked him down to a tennis court where he was taking on two @entity121 tourists			2
rather than turn on @entity89 , @entity2 asked the unsuspecting @entity121 why they were expending his player ’s energy the night before the biggest game of his life			1
@entity89 took advantage and headed straight for bed			0
twenty - four hours later and @entity2 was again looking out for his prodigious talent following the booking which would rule him out of the final			1
@entity132 , famously , turned to @entity2 in the wake of @entity89 ’s tears			1
@entity132 later said : ‘ out of everything in my career , the moment people ask me about most often was when @entity89 got booked in that semi-final			0
‘ i could see his bottom lip was going			0
i think it says a lot about @entity2 that it was him i turned to , to ask him to have a word			1
‘ @entity2 knew instinctively when to scold him and when to put an arm round his shoulder			1
@entity89 was an emotional guy and i know he exasperated @entity148 on occasions but @entity2 was brilliant at connecting with people			1
’ remembering @entity2 - the miner ’s son who was raised in a @entity154 pit village - sir @entity152 said : ‘ i was never too big or proud to ask him for advice , which he gave freely and unconditionally			1
thoughts : the @entity35 will honour the former @entity39 manager with a sir @entity38 celebration giving : the sir @entity17 has raised £ 7.3m for cancer research , treatment and care ‘ his character was hewn out of the coalface ; developed by the @entity154 mining background that he came from			1
‘ his parents instilled in him the discipline and standards which forged the character of a colossal human being			0
’ @entity132 and @entity152 ’s words have been , and will continue to be , echoed by the game ’s greatest ; from @entity177 to ronaldo to @entity178			0
but it is @entity2 ’s own words which best capture the emotion he still manages to evoke			2
in his book , my kind of @entity185 , @entity2 wrote : ‘ what is a club in any case ? @entity189 : @entity89 pictured hugging @entity39 manager @entity2 after @entity39 's victory over @entity191 in the @entity193 quater - final down : @entity89 being consoled by @entity2 during @entity39 's @entity193 semi-final with @entity97 ‘ not the buildings or the directors or the people who are paid to represent it			1
‘ it ’s not the television contracts , get - out clauses , marketing departments or executive boxes			0
‘ it ’s the noise , the passion , the feeling of belonging , the pride in your city			0
‘ it ’s a small boy clambering up stadium steps for the very first time , gripping his father ’s hand , gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him and , without being able to do a thing about it , falling in love			0
he cared , not only about his players , but every supporter who walked through the turnstile			0
he had been one of them as a boy at @entity50 ’s @entity94 and never lost sight of that			2
and that is why football will never lose sight of @entity2 – be it five years or 50 , the grandfather of football will never get old			2
sharing a joke : @entity2 flies back from the 1982 @entity86 with then - manager @entity236 @entity178 , who worked with @entity2 at @entity49			1
‘ i will keep with me always the @entity2 of every day , a person who had extraordinary passion for life and for football , with an extraordinary enthusiasm			1
‘ @entity2 is one of those people who never die , not so much for what he did in his career , for one victory more or less , but for what he knew to give to those who had , like me , the good fortune to know him and walk by his side			2
’ @entity253 , the @entity252 striker @entity2 described as one of his greatest players			2
‘ it makes me feel happy to hear how highly sir @entity2 talked about me because he ’s a legend of football			1
‘ i ’m proud to have worked with him			0
he was an awesome coach and an awesome person			0
he was like a father to me			0
‘ i have had a lot of managers in football but the difference between all of them and sir @entity2 was his humanity and the relationships he had with the players			1
he was always like a father to everyone			0
’ legend : ronaldo scoring for @entity275 against @entity97 in the 2002 @entity86 final in @entity277 @entity75 , his @entity50 goalkeeper with a more light - hearted recollection			2
‘ we were once training at @entity281 and a guy was trying to land a helicopter on a newly seeded pitch			0
‘ sir @entity2 was underneath the blades , whirling round three feet over his head , shouting , “ what you doing , what you doing ? ” pointing him back over the fence			1
he was nearly decapitated , protecting the grass as if he had paid for every seed			0
’ @entity177 , whose career he rejuvenated at @entity50			2
‘ i was disillusioned ( before @entity2 came in as manager ) , i was n’t enjoying the game			1
i was n’t scoring goals and was n’t playing as i knew i could			0
‘ he knew me as a person , i ’d spoken to him many times			0
he knew me as a player			0
he tried to buy me when he was manager at @entity49 , and he just came in and he got me playing in a different way			2
‘ he got me playing again with a smile on my face and enjoying football			0
if it was n’t for him then certainly my @entity50 career would have ended early			2
‘ he was just a unique man			0
he was able to light the dressing room up			0
because of his experience and because of the respect that everyone had for him when he spoke people listened			0
‘ and when he spoke and asked you to do well you wanted to do well for him because you liked him and you adored him and you felt for him and you felt the pressures and the pain he was going through			0
he had that aura about him			0
‘ he will never , ever be beaten			0
