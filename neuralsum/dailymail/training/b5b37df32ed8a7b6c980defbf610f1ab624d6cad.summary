by @entity0 published : 17:33 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 01:58 est , 25 june 2013 senior doctors say it is ‘ utter folly ’ for patients to be able to get routine appointments and surgery on the @entity6 seven days a week			1
they say running the health service ‘ like @entity9 ’ – which has many stores open 24 hours a day – is unaffordable			1
the expense would be further ‘ magnified ’ , one doctor said , because staff working on sundays would expect a ‘ premium rate of pay ’			1
senior doctors say that it is unaffordable to open surgeries seven days a week , like a @entity9 the government wants to improve staffing levels and the availability of @entity6 services at weekends following concerns that patients are dying because current standards are poor			1
last month a study revealed that patients undergoing routine surgery at the weekend were 82 per cent more likely to die compared with on a monday – partly because fewer consultants were on duty			0
the @entity30 , which represents senior doctors , said the @entity6 can not afford to provide the same tests and treatments at weekends as it does during the week			2
dr @entity34 , a member of the @entity30 ’s gp committee , said : ‘ it ’s utter folly to compare the @entity6 therefore with a seven days a week supermarket			1
‘ @entity9 opens for seven days for commercial reasons alone			2
’ dr @entity34 nagpaulsaid that @entity9 opens seven days a week for commercial reasons , and it is unrealistic to compare the supermarket with a gp addressing the association ’s annual conference yesterday , he said : ‘ nurses and physios in hospital and community , health visitors , social workers , pharmacists will all need to be funded and open seven days a week or it would be a nonsense to claim a routine @entity6 service if it is only partial and piecemeal			1
‘ and of course staff working on sundays will expect a premium rate of pay magnifying the expense			1
’ @entity61 , co-director of @entity62 , said doctors simply did not want to work out - of - hours and were putting their ‘ own interests before the patients ’			0
she said : ‘ when you are ill it does n’t matter what time it is , you need the appropriate care			0
’ gps can opt out of working evenings and weekends under a contract negotiated under @entity74 which also led to their salaries doubling			0
last month a study revealed that patients undergoing routine surgery at the weekend were 82 per cent more likely to die compared with on a monday a similar contract for hospital consultants in 2003 allowed them to work fewer evenings and weekends			0
the chairman of the @entity30 , dr @entity82 , said ‘ we all want ’ weekend care to be at the same standard as that provided during the week			0
but he added : ‘ the calls we sometimes hear for a @entity6 , full service , 24/7 , are just ridiculous when the health service can barely afford its current model			2
’ @entity91 , chief executive of the @entity92 ’ @entity30 said the ‘ nhs should be an organisation that puts the patient at the centre of everything that it does ’			0
she said : ‘ it is time for all professionals to accept that the @entity6 must be a 24 hours a day , seven day a week service			0
