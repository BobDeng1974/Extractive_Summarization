a smiling prince @entity0 crouches over the body of one - ton water buffalo moments after he shot it dead on a hunting trip			1
this photograph has emerged less than a week after the young royal pledged to do all he could to save @entity8 ’s critically endangered wildlife			1
and it also follows worldwide condemnation of another royal hunting trip just ten days ago when prince @entity12 went boar shooting in @entity14			1
croucing over the body of a water buffalo : the picture was taken in november 2004 , when the then 20 - year - old was on a gap year trip to @entity20 shortly before he enrolled at @entity22 military academy @entity0 , who is also known to stalk stag , is likely to face similar attention following the publication of this picture , which has not been seen before in the @entity27			1
it was taken in november 2004 , when the then 20 - year - old was on a gap year trip to @entity20 shortly before he enrolled at @entity22 military academy			1
the prince spent several months working on the @entity33 polo farm in @entity34			1
during the trip , he and his then girlfriend @entity35 joined an expedition to hunt big game , staying at a private lodge in the province of @entity41			2
the ranch was owned by count @entity43 , one of the country ’s most powerful landowners with more than 170,000 acres stocked with game			2
worries : speaking at a conference on thursday , @entity49 - flanked by his two sons - warned that the imminent extinction of some of the world 's most precious species would have ' dire consequences for humanity ' a firm called @entity58 organised the shooting party			2
the company offers huntsmen the chance to bag red stag , wild deer , puma , antelope , boar and birds such as doves and pigeon			2
but the water buffalo , which can turn deadly if wounded , is the ‘ trophy kill ’ for any @entity34 hunter			1
prince @entity12 has reportedly promised to destroy all the ivory from the @entity75 at @entity76			2
the @entity77 , 31 , is said to want to act in the hope that it will ‘ send a message ’ to illegal elephant poachers and encourage other heads of state to follow suit			2
the priceless collection includes around 1,200 items which contain ivory – from fans and miniatures to a throne from @entity89 presented to @entity91 @entity90 with elephant - ivory plaques			0
@entity93 , a veteran primatologist , said she had spoken to the prince and he declared he would ‘ like to see all the ivory owned by @entity76 destroyed ’			0
the plan has been widely praised , with @entity98 mp @entity97 saying : ‘ it ’s difficult to imagine a stronger symbol of the horrors of ivory than @entity76 publicly destroying its own			0
good for prince @entity12 for pushing this			0
’ but art critic @entity103 called the move ‘ pointless ’ , adding : ‘ i ca n’t see the connection between saving elephants and destroying works of art made centuries ago			0
’ the collection comprises more than a million paintings , antiques and artefacts held in trust on behalf of the nation			0
a @entity116 spokesman declined to comment			0
at the time , a local newspaper claimed the head of the animal in the picture , and that of a wild boar shot by @entity0 , were embalmed so they could be shipped back to the @entity27 as a gift for the prince			1
it is not clear whether this ever took place			0
a @entity116 spokesman declined to comment on the photo last night			0
but a senior royal aide said : ‘ it would be a great shame if the publication of this picture were to detract from the efforts being made by the three princes to curb the appalling illegal wildlife trade			1
‘ like his father and brother , prince @entity0 has always been a strong supporter of the campaign to protect endangered species			1
’ speaking at a conference on thursday , prince @entity49 – flanked by his two sons – warned that the imminent extinction of some of the world ’s most precious species would have ‘ dire consequences for humanity ’			0
the heir to the throne told the meeting of international leaders in @entity154 that the ‘ appalling ’ illegal trade in ivory , rhino horn , tiger parts and endangered animals was ‘ annihilating our threatened wildlife ’			1
there is no suggestion that any member of the @entity164 has ever shot an animal illegally			0
in 1961 , on an official visit to @entity89 with the @entity91 , prince @entity166 , a former president of the @entity167 , shot a tiger at @entity170 , while a guest of the @entity172 of @entity173			1
on the same trip the royal – once a keen big game - hunter who shot stag , pheasant and grouse until recently – killed a crocodile and six urials , a type of mountain sheep			2
his actions prompted widespread condemnation from @entity27 and @entity89 politicians			0
but , significantly , they were not against the law at the time .			0

picture was taken in 2004 when he was on @entity20 gap year trip
@entity166 spent months working on the @entity33 polo farm in @entity34
@entity0 has pledged to do all he can to save @entity8 's endangered wildlife
