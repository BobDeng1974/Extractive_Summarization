selected by the @entity0 on friday by @entity1 and @entity2 published : 19:12 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 26 april 2013 @entity3 is headed to @entity0 after being chosen early in the second round of the @entity6 draft by the @entity0 on friday after being passed over by the first round picks			1
@entity3 , who led @entity8 to the national championship game , was projected as a first - rounder last year but because of the hoax involving his fake girlfriend and his poor performance in a rout at the hands of @entity15 dropped his stock			1
the @entity19 @entity18 linebacker drew a loud roar from the fans when he was finally selected , but he was nowhere in sight having skipped the ceremony and stayed in @entity24			2
completion : @entity3 was chosen by the @entity0 on friday during the second round of the @entity6 draft when former @entity0 defensive back @entity27 was handed the card to make the announcement by commissioner @entity31 , he was told , ' you 're going to get a big cheer when you announce this pick			1
' it was more a mix of surprise and recognition of the most talked - about player in the draft finally finding a landing spot at no. 38 overall			0
unpicked : @entity3 , a former @entity8 linebacker , was not present at @entity42 for the draft , opting instead to stay at his home in @entity24 the @entity0 traded up with @entity44 to grab @entity3 , whose tabloid - ready story of the woman who supposedly died during the season - only for the @entity49 runner - up to acknowledge in january that he had been a victim of a hoax - made for a national soap opera			1
@entity3 ran a 4.82 - second 40 - yard dash at the @entity6 combine , slow for a linebacker			1
he did better at @entity8 's pro day , but @entity6 teams already had plenty of football reasons to doubt his worthiness as a first - round pick			1
the regular - season dominance by the 6 - foot - 1 , 240 - pound @entity18 now seems so long ago			0
he led one of the top defenses in the country for an undefeated team			0
his seven interceptions were more than any other linebacker in 2012 , and he finished second in the @entity49 voting behind @entity68 quarterback @entity67			0
he was the third linebacker chosen in this draft			0
the teams believed to have taken the most interest in @entity3 - the @entity73 ( 20th pick ) and the @entity75 ( 23rd pick ) - decided to go with and tackle @entity77 and cornerback @entity78 , respectively			1
the @entity75 had another shot at a first - rounder with the 25th pick , but went with @entity83 cornerback @entity82 instead			0
hyped up : he was expected to be selected during the first round but was passed over by multiple interested parties , perhaps because of a combination of his poor recent performance and his girlfriend hoax scandal even before the draft started , football fans could not resist taking digs at @entity3 on social networking sites like @entity95 and @entity96			1
one user tweeted a picture of an empty chair with the caption : ' waiting with manti teo 's gf waiting to see what team will draft him			0
' another posted : ' @entity3 has a better chance of getting a call from his fake girlfriend rather than an @entity6 team			1
' @entity3 's tragic story about his girlfriend , @entity110 , tugged on @entity112 's heartstrings last september as @entity8 began their push into the @entity115 championships			1
@entity110 supposedly died around september 12 from leukemia after recovering from a near fatal car crash - just six hours after his grandmother passed away			0
among those that paid tribute to @entity122 was @entity123 , which showed a picture of her on this morning with a direct quote she has supposedly said to @entity3 : ' @entity131 , if anything happens to me , you promise that you 'll stay there and you 'll play and you 'll honor me through the way you play			1
' fake : the @entity95 account of @entity110 was made using photos of @entity136 , a high school classmate of @entity137 who claimed she had never met nor spoken to @entity3 but it was n't until a groundbreaking article on @entity141 that @entity142 was exposed as an elaborate hoax			1
the scheme was found to be orchestrated by @entity145 , who admitted that he used phony @entity95 and @entity96 accounts to get @entity3 's attention , win his affection and carry on an exclusive online relationship			1
in those fake accounts was a picture of a woman , later identified as @entity136 , a high school classmate of @entity137 who claimed that she had never met or spoken to @entity3			2
@entity3 claimed that he was a victim , and was not in on the scandal			2
in an interview with @entity154 in late january , @entity3 said that he briefly lied about his online girlfriend , after discovering she did n't exist			2
but he maintained that he had no part in creating the hoax			0
deceived : earlier this week @entity3 emotionally denied he was involved in any sort of cover - up while instead admitting he believed @entity110 , played by @entity145 , was real self - indulging : @entity145 said that he fell ' deeply , romantically in love ' with @entity3 though he was playing him for a fool while pretending to be a woman pressed by @entity154 to admit that he was in on the deception , @entity3 said he believed that ' @entity142 ' had died of cancer			2
' you stuck to the script			0
and you knew that something was amiss , @entity3 , ' the talk show host said			2
he replied : ' @entity154 , put yourself in my situation			0
@entity173 , my whole world told me that she died on september 12			0
this girl , who i committed myself to , died on september 12			0
' @entity154 also asked @entity3 point blank : ' are you gay ? ' cracking a smile , he responded : ' @entity181 from it			2
' in an interview with dr @entity185 , @entity145 admitted that he was gay and fell ' deeply , romantically in love ' with the @entity8 linebacker even though he was deceiving him			0
@entity145 also confirmed that it was him impersonating ' @entity142 , ' despite the fact that voicemail recordings sound high - pitched and feminine			0
since the @entity154 interview , @entity3 has mostly stayed out of the limelight , but appeared at the @entity6 scouting combine in february and was pictured during various workouts .			1
