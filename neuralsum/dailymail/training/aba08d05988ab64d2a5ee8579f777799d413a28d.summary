by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 13 september 2012 the world 's oldest @entity2 motor car is expected to fetch more than £ 300,000 when it comes up for auction next month			1
not only is it 109 years old , but the vehicle - known as chassis 30 - can also be credited with having saved the fledgling firm from bankruptcy			1
the ' @entity10 ' was @entity2 's first design , and @entity12 was the third of 1,750 units rolled out between 1903 and 1904			1
with its two predecessors consigned to the scrapheap , the vehicle takes the title of the oldest surviving @entity2			1
unique opportunity : the oldest surviving @entity20 ' was the third car ever to be built by the company preserved : the vintage vehicle stayed in the same family for nearly fifty years , and has been lovingly preserved by every one of its owners			2
it is expected to fetch upwards of £ 300,000 when it comes to auction in october the @entity31 giant has since sold more than 350 million cars around the world , and is more popular in the @entity34 than any other manufacturer			1
but if it was n’t for this particular vehicle , then the company might have gone bust before it had even got off the ground			0
in july 1903 the newly - established @entity2 was in dire straits with cash reserves of just $ 223.65			1
deposits received on @entity12 and two other @entity43 helped see it through to the end of the month			0
with a 1668cc , two - cylinder engine , the four - seat @entity10 put out a mere 8bhp to give it a top speed of 28mph			0
chassis 30 was bought new in 1903 by butter maker @entity49 , and stayed within the same family until 1950			0
advanced for its time : the @entity10 's 8bhp engine could propel it to a top speed of 28mph despite its age it has had just five owners in 109 - years and underwent a full restoration in 2007			1
the antique automobile will go under the hammer at @entity61 ’ @entity63 sale in @entity64 , @entity31 on october 11			0
it is being offered with an estimate of between $ 300,000 and $ 500,000 ( £ 186,000 - £ 310,000 )			2
lifeline : the deposit on @entity12 saved the fledgling @entity2 from bankruptcy and ensured @entity70 would become a centre of automobile manufacturing a statement from @entity61 , which is handling the sale , said : ' it is impossible to overstate the importance of chassis number 30			1
' it is accompanied by extensive documentation , detailing its extraordinary history , and its condition is exemplary			0
' no automobile manufacturer has had anywhere close to the impact of the @entity2			2
setting a precedent : @entity2 would go on to sell over 350 million vehicles worldwide since 1903 ' without @entity88 ’s $ 170 cheque , modern day motorists might be driving @entity89 or @entity90 or @entity91 , and might speak of @entity92 or @entity93 in the same way they speak of @entity70			2
' chassis number 30 is one of three @entity2 sold on the first day the @entity98 orders			0
' it is the only survivor of the three , has had only five owners in the nearly 110 years since it was built , has been carefully maintained and restored , and its history and provenance are impeccable			0

109 - year - old model a was third car ever made by @entity2
