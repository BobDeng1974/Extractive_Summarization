by @entity0 struggling teen fashion chain @entity1 has announced that the days of its tired nightclub themed stores are over , and will be undergoing a major makeover			1
or a make - under as the case may be			2
in the coming months , the dim lights of its some 400 @entity11 stores will be turned up , the thumping music turned down , the half - naked lingering models will acquire clothing and even the pungent perfume spritzes will be reduced by 25 per cent , according to @entity14			0
' [ @entity1 ] is targeted to its customer , its customer is changing , and we ’re ready to change with her and him ' , says @entity21 , its characteristically stubborn 69 - year - old ceo , notorious for once insisting that the brand only caters to ' cool ' and ' attractive ' kids			1
growing up ? @entity1 will be toning down its @entity11 stores , lifting the lights , quietening the thumping music , covering up its bare - chested models and even lessening the over-zealous perfume spritzes as part of the overhaul , the heavy , daylight obscuring shutters on the windows have already been removed in 240 stores around the @entity11 even the logos are being toned down and made less prominent			0
the store , which still does n't offer women 's clothing in sizes that exceed ' large ' , a notably small size ten , will also introduce the larger sizes it promised in november , later on this year			1
and in another 360 degree spin for mr @entity21 , black will be introduced to some of the new designs , after years of his refusal to permit it previously			1
hardly flying off the shelves : in response to poor sales , the brand 's logos will also be made less prominent and clothes in larger sizes will be on sale later this year a leaf out of their book ? teen favorite @entity59 ( pictured ) is popular for its cheap , fast revolving stock which satisfies the fickle tastes of youngsters around the @entity11 the ailing teen fashion brand has long been struggling to compete with cheaper , fast - turnaround chains such as @entity65 and @entity59 , as well as with the storming success of online portals with cult social media followings such as @entity69 with that in mind , @entity1 is also attempting to infiltrate the heaving beast of the teen blogosphere by striking deals with key influencers in the manner of its competitors			1
which might be somewhat of a challenge , given the brand 's persistent hangover from comments mr @entity21 made back in 2006 , sparking a boycott from stars including @entity86 and @entity87			1
current season : @entity1 's preppy , flesh exposing clothing once crawled the hallways of @entity11 high schools and remained popular and highly - desirable for decades hunks : some shoppers swoon over the @entity97 god physiques of the @entity1 models scattered around stores , others are intimidated , but either way , the shirts are going back on ' we hire good - looking people in our stores , ' @entity21 said in 2006			1
' because good - looking people attract other good - looking people , and we want to market to cool , good - looking people			0
we do n't market to anyone other than that			0
' he continued : ' in every school there are the cool and popular kids , and then there are the not - so - cool kids			0
candidly , we go after the cool kids			0
' when asked if he considered @entity1 ' exclusionary ' , he replied : ' absolutely			0
a lot of people do n't belong [ in our clothes ] , and they ca n't belong			0
' ceo : @entity21 , 69 , caused outrage in 2006 for agreeing that yes , @entity1 is ' exclusionary ' , saying that ' a lot of people do n't belong , and ca n't belong ' in his stores @entity1 was originally established as a sporting goods retailer in 1892 , and operated a @entity128 store that was frequented by game - hunting enthusiasts like @entity130			1
the retailer changed ownership and direction many times and by the mid- 1990s had transformed itself into a hub for teenage fashion			2
@entity1 ’s skin - tight ribbed tank tops , ripped flare jeans , hooded sweatshirts , and leather flip - flop sandals became stalwarts in the hallways of @entity11 high schools			0
' we want to market to cool , good - looking people			0
we do n't market to anyone other than that ' but the brand - confident in its established standing - has ultimately failed to innovate in recent years			2
last november , even @entity1 's own head of planning , @entity152 , called the label ‘ a stale brand , ’ @entity151 reported			1
‘ we recognize that our businesses have been and will continue to be disrupted by both fast fashion and pure play e-commerce competitors , ’ she said , further explaining : ‘ while the company is playing good defense by cutting expenses , this does little to revitalize what we believe is a stale brand			2

the ailing teen fashion label will also be introducing larger sizes later this year
