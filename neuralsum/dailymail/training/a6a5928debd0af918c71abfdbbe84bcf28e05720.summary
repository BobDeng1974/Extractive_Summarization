by @entity0 the final survivor of the elite @entity3 codebreaking team that cracked @entity5 's secret messages during the @entity6 has died aged 93			1
@entity8 ' @entity7 - who helped crack the system carrying messages between @entity5 and his top generals – died at his home in @entity13 , @entity14 on tuesday following a short illness			1
captain @entity16 was the last remaining founder member of a team which cracked the @entity20 ’s @entity19 code , and in doing so shortened the @entity6 by at least two years			1
@entity3 codebreaker @entity16 , who helped smash the @entity23 high command 's @entity19 system , has died aged 93 the @entity23 tunny system was used by @entity5 , @entity25 and other high ranking generals during the @entity6 , and was made up of four times as many encryption wheels as the famous enigma machine			1
last year , to mark the significance of captain @entity32 ’s work , he received an mbe and a set of commemorative stamps issued in his name			2
he told the @entity38 : ‘ this was intelligence gold dust , really top level stuff			2
[ we cracked the ] movements of troops , not just divisions or regiments but of [ whole ] armies			0
’ he also described seeing the messages between @entity5 and his generals and says a landmark moment in his career was ' seeing the signature come up - of ' @entity5 , spacer , @entity5 , spacer , fuhrer , spacer '			1
' ' a very simple signature ; i imagine the person who received the signature stood up and saluted			0
' the rebuilt @entity19 machine at @entity60 at @entity3 and a wartime photograph of captain @entity16 , one of the four man team who cracked the code the highly - secretive work at the @entity3 listening post , is believed to have shortened the length of the war by at least two years capt @entity16 joined @entity3 as a cryptographer and linguist in 1941 and was one of four founder members of the @entity74 , an elite unit named after the man leading it , @entity75 , which cracked the @entity19 code - making it possible to read @entity5 's messages during the war			1
the @entity74 team , which grew to 118 by the end of the war , managed to reverse - engineer the @entity19 , which had 12 encryption wheels to the enigma machine 's three , described by @entity3 as ' an incredible feat of dedication '			1
the spokeswoman said : ' @entity90 came to @entity3 straight from university but they were all in unchartered territory			0
it was new ground for everybody			0
' the intelligence gathered at @entity3 is credited with providing strategic information that was passing between the top level commanders and is believed to have shortened the war by two years and helped to save millions of lives			0
captain @entity16 worked at @entity3 until 1945 before moving to the @entity101 for two years , followed by a 50 - year career in marketing and research			0
honoured : captain @entity16 receives his mbe from the @entity106 at @entity107 last year later in life he became a tireless ambassador for the memory of those who had served in secret , and spent years campaigning for acknowledgement of his colleagues , including @entity115 , who broke the @entity116			0
he argued the @entity74 as a whole should be honoured for its work - including @entity119 who broke the @entity19 system to help shorten the war ; and @entity122 , who designed and built the @entity123 , which sped up some stages of the breaking of @entity19 traffic			2
their stream of intelligence proved vital in the d - day invasion and helped save many lives			0
the codebreaker , originally from @entity13 in @entity14 , worked at @entity3 , @entity133 , until the end of the @entity6 before spending two years at the @entity101 , and then moved on to a 50 - year career in marketing and research			0
the rebuilt @entity19 machine now sits in the new @entity139 at @entity60 the intelligence war waging in a quiet corner of @entity133 was to be decisive in the @entity143 effort to win the @entity6			1
@entity3 - known now as @entity3 - was the hub of @entity146 's code - backing effort , where hugely talented mathematicians and inventors worked tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping - hand			1
as @entity153 himself made clear , the accurate information which flowed from @entity3 , at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day , saved lives and gave @entity146 a crucial edge in battle			2
codenamed @entity159 the intelligence provided crucial assistance to the @entity143 war effort			0
sir @entity162 , a @entity163 veteran and the official historian of @entity165 during the @entity6 , said that @entity159 shortened the war by two to four years and that the outcome of the war would have been uncertain without it			0
captain @entity16 was one of the four founder members of the @entity74 in october 1941 , along with team leader @entity75 , major @entity171 and captain @entity173			2
after a few months of breaking of a @entity177 cipher system used by the @entity178 , the unit was tasked with breaking the @entity20 ’s most top - level code @entity19			1
despite being @entity5 ’s most secret code system and having 12 wheels against well - known 3 wheel @entity116 , tens of thousands of @entity19 messages were intercepted by the @entity146 and broken at @entity3			1
by the @entity184 , the @entity74 had grown to 9 cryptanalysts , a team of 24 ats , a total staff of 118 , organised in three shifts working round the clock .			0

captain @entity192 was last survivor of crucial codebreaking team
they succeeded in cracking the @entity20 's @entity19 code
@entity19 used four times as many encryption wheels as the enigma machine
it was used to send messages between @entity5 and his top generals
