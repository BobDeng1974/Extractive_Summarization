help : the @entity1 spray could be in bathroom cabinets as early as next year he has already helped prevent millions of men from flopping in the bedroom			1
now one of the inventors of @entity8 claims to have a drug that will help many more experience the joy of sex			0
@entity13 , one of the team of scientists who developed @entity8 in the @entity16 , is poised to launch a treatment for premature ejaculation			1
@entity1 , a spray - on medication , has been judged safe and effective by the @entity20 and is expected in bedroom cabinets early next year			1
premature ejaculation is a problem that affects at least one in four men , making it more common than the impotence caused by @entity8			0
in trials , men who used the spray ahead of sex lasted on average five times longer			1
women also benefited from longer love making , with both sexes expressing greater satisfaction with their sex life			2
dr @entity13 , formerly of pharmaceutical giant @entity37 and now of small @entity39 biotech firm @entity38 , said : ‘ premature ejaculation does n’t just make the patient feel bad			1
‘ it does affect the partner and can completely destroy relationships			0
i feel this could save relationships			0
’ premature ejaculation can wreck self - esteem , make it difficult to form and maintain relationships and , at its worst , can make it impossible for partner to become pregnant			2
despite its toll , there is just one pill specifically designed to tackle the problem but it is expensive and not widely available in the @entity39			0
the exact causes are unclear but it is thought over-sensitivity is part of the problem			0
the @entity1 spray contains low doses of two anaesthetics which help give a man more control			1
it only takes around five minutes to get work , although those who like to be spontaneous will be pleased to know it can be sprayed on up to two hours before sex			0
a pocket - sized can will last a year , if a man has sex five or six times a month			1
however , some of those who tested the drug experienced side - effects , including burning sensations and headaches			2
and some fear that using a drug as a ‘ quick fix ’ will prevent couples from confronting the stress , anxiety and relationship troubles that could be at the heart of the problem			0
research : dr @entity13 helped develop @entity8 , pictured , which made £ 1.3billion worldwide last year @entity1 will only be available on private prescription initially			1
but it is hoped that it will be judged cheap enough in the long - run to be prescribed to some men on the @entity97			2
with sales of @entity8 worth £ 1.3billion a year worldwide , the new drug has the potential to be a blockbuster			2
however , dr @entity13 will not receive any royalties from the sales and only has a very small holding in @entity38			1
he says he was motivated by scientific curiosity and that the launch will be a triumph for a small @entity39 company that lacks the manpower and resources of the big players in the market			0
@entity1 ’s preliminary approval for sale @entity114 is expected to be rubber - stamped by the @entity116 in the next few weeks			1
@entity117 , one of @entity39 ’s leading experts on male sexual problems and a past president of the @entity122 , said : ‘ whilst premature ejaculation is not a life - threatening condition , its consequences can be serious			0
‘ this is a chronic , debilitating problem , affecting both men and their partners			0

dr @entity13 developed spray - on medication @entity1
trials *suggest* that those who used the spray lasted five times longer
judged safe by @entity20 and expected on sale next year
