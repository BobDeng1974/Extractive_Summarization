the true extent of the security threat posed by @entity3 whistleblower @entity2 is ' unknown ' , according to a top government aid , as it is revealed the @entity5 is unsure what secret files he possesses			1
the revelation came as a new batch of highly classified documents was made public across the internet yesterday , revealing how the @entity14 government has collected online data in bulk			1
fugitive leaker mr @entity2 , who worked as an undercover computer specialist with the @entity18 before contracting with the @entity3 , remains in the transit area of @entity20 , in @entity21			1
he had been expected to fly to @entity22 but has not reportedly left @entity23			0
support : @entity2 supporters hold posters outside @entity20 , airport in @entity21 that read : ' @entity2 ! @entity23 is your second @entity27 ! ' ( left ) and , ' @entity23 is for @entity2 ! ' @entity23 and foreign journalists continued to monitor the @entity20 , where @entity2 is believed to remain at the transit zone			1
this poster reads : ' we will not give @entity2 to world gendarme ! ' speaking in @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , deputy national security adviser to president @entity37 , said : ' look , i do n't know with certainty what mr @entity2 has			1
that 's something we 're actively seeking to determine			0
' quoted in an @entity44 article , mr @entity36 said @entity2 had already compromised ' very classified programs ' by leaking secret files to three newspapers and by taking files out of the country			2
@entity36 said it was still believed that @entity2 was carrying the classified files on his person			2
the government adviser said there were ' strict protocols ' for how to handle classified information			0
' it does n't involve getting on a plane and going to @entity59 and then getting on a plane and going to @entity23 , ' he said			1
officials in the @entity14 are actively trying to determine which documents have been accessed by the former contract worker , carrying out forensic audits of computers and systems @entity2 had used			1
but there are fears the computer specialist may have hidden his tracks so well at the @entity3 that it will be impossible to identify exactly what was copied			2
the intelligence community is also in the process of assessing the potential damage to national security relating to leaked information so far			0
mr @entity2 was expected to fly to @entity22 on monday , having booked a ticket from @entity21 , but he did not board the plane			2
it is believed he may be having difficulties with his documents since the @entity14 revoked his passport			2

' , ' we will not give @entity2 to world gendarme ! ' and ' @entity2 we are with you ! ' despite the @entity14 urging @entity23 to extradite him immediately , president @entity90 has refused , saying there is no extradition treaty with the @entity14 , and @entity2 has not committed any crimes in his country			1
for such a long stay , he must have secured a transit visa from a consulate operating in the zone			0

both require a valid passport or other identification ; the @entity14 has revoked @entity2 's passport			2
the next possible flight to @entity22 is saturday			0
president @entity37 has said he wo n't engage in any ' wheeling , dealing and trading ' to get @entity3 leaker @entity2 extradited from @entity23 to the @entity14			1

' he said that the documents leaked by @entity2 have had their effect but that the government has responded that the surveillance programs are conducted legally and with proper oversight			0
he added that @entity2 's story has the makings of a big - screen spy film or a ' made - for - tv movie '			0
on the run : @entity2 is currently believed to be in a transit terminal of a @entity23 airport as he waits for asylum papers from @entity144 the comments come after it emerged that the @entity14 embarrassingly failed to extradite @entity2 from @entity59 after using the wrong middle name on papers			1
@entity150 arrest warrant documents listed his middle name as @entity152 , whereas it is @entity153			0
in other papers , he was just called @entity2 , @entity59 's secretary of justice @entity154 said			2
when @entity59 asked the @entity14 for clarification last friday , they failed to respond in time for officials to stop @entity2 's flight to @entity23 on sunday			1
' until the minute of @entity2 's departure , the @entity14 government had n't yet replied to our requests for clarification , ' @entity154 told the @entity165			1
' @entity59 's government had no legal basis to block his departure			0
' it is believed he hopes to seek asylum in @entity144 , a process which could take months			0

foreign minister @entity197 confirmed that he remained there on wednesday			0
@entity2 had also booked a seat on a @entity201 - bound flight on monday en route to @entity203 and then possible asylum in @entity144 , but he failed to board the plane			0
despite @entity14 officials called for @entity2 to be extradited immediately , but @entity23 said it would not as they have no extradition treaty with the country and @entity2 has not committed a crime in @entity23			1
hurdles : @entity144 's foreign minister @entity180 said it could take months to secure asylum for @entity2 ' he has n't violated any of our laws , he has n't crossed our border , he is in the transit zone of the airport and has the right to fly in any direction he wants , ' @entity197 said			2
