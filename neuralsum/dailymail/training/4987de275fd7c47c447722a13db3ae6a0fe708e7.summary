this amazing picture shows winter sweeping south in dramatic style as a huge dust cloud is blasted over @entity3			1
the storm is part of a frigid wave of arctic air pushing south into the @entity8 , coating parts of the @entity10 with more than a foot of snow			2
and along with dumps of snow - which will spread across the country later in the week - the influx of cold air sent temperatures tumbling as much as 50 degrees in hours			1
dust storm : this image , taken from the window of a passenger plane over @entity3 , was caused by cold air pushing south thanks to an unusual weather system that sent temperatures plummeting the dust storm , seen from the window of a passenger plane headed to @entity29 from @entity30 , was created when winds plunging south kicked up loose dirt particles and carried them along in their wake			1
passenger @entity34 managed to get the aerial shot from the plane window , which shows the boundary between the new , cold front and the warmer air it is pushing out of the way			0
the phenomenon , known as a haboob , was also caught in satellite images by the @entity44			0
it is part of the ' @entity47 ' weather system being caused by the remnants of a @entity49 sat in the @entity50			2
from space : this weather satellite image , uploaded and annotated by the @entity44 , shows the ' haboob ' front ( circled ) sweeping south from @entity3 from above pushing south : the unseasonably cold air ( blue and purple above ) has been spreading south over the weekend , reaching as far as @entity56 , where temperatures tumbled some 50 degrees in a matter of hours the system alters the path of the jet stream - fast - flowing winds which separate warm and cold air - bringing unusual temperatures across @entity64			1
cold air which usually sits around @entity66 and the north of the @entity8 has been dragged as far south as @entity56 , while the warm air which usually sits around the middle of the @entity8 has been sucked up towards @entity70 , and is set to make the region unusually warm			2
the boundaries of these temperature changes are accompanied by dramatic changes in climate , and spectacular weather formations such as the pictured dust storm			0
snowstorms : midwestern states have been hit by intense snowstorms as part of the weather formation			0
pictured is the scene in @entity85 , @entity86 road chaos : pictured is a pick - up truck that overturned near @entity90 , @entity91 , yesterday parts of @entity56 which were enjoying temperatures in the mid to high 70s over the weekend found themselves plunged into the teens in a matter of hours when the cold air rolled in			0
by thursday full effects of the displacement will have set in , meaning areas like @entity100 , the northernmost point of @entity70 , could have temperatures in the 50s			0
this outstrips estimates for @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 for now , the most visible effect of the weather system has been huge snowstorms pummeling the @entity10 , where schools have closed and hundreds of accidents have been reported on roads around @entity115 and @entity91 , where as much as 16.5 inches of snow have fallen .			1
