by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 06:46 est , 19 september 2013 for most people , the thought of a bonus often goes hand in hand with dreams of acquiring the latest designer handbag or gadget			2
but new research suggests that giving it all away could in fact give you the biggest buzz of all			0
scientists believe that individuals gain happiness and productivity at work as well as better team performance by sharing their bonus money			1
a series of studies found providing employees with a bonus to spend on charities or their co-workers also led to uplifted team sales			1
researchers at @entity30 believe individuals gain happiness and productivity at work as well as better team performance by sharing their work bonus the research was conducted by @entity36 at @entity30 and published in the @entity38 journal			1
in three studies where some employees at an @entity45 bank were given a $ 25 or $ 50 voucher to donate to charity on behalf of their company , employees who donated the larger amount to charity reported enhanced happiness and job satisfaction , compared to those who did not donate to charity or donated the smaller amount			1
in subsequent experiments , the researchers measured the performance of 11 sports teams in @entity57 and 14 pharmaceutical sales teams in @entity59 after receiving bonuses			1
a third of each team was selected to receive $ 20 to spend either on themselves or on their teammates			1
in both experiments , the researchers found that when participants spent their bonuses on teammates , the whole team performed significantly better than when individuals spent their bonuses on themselves			1

in the case of pharmaceutical sales , for every $ 10 given to a team member to spend on their colleagues , the team received $ 52 in sales			1
@entity92 from the university said : ' the results across three studies suggest that a minor adjustment to employee bonuses - shifting the focus from the self to others - can create more altruistic , satisfying , and productive workplace			2
' recent research by the university into the relationship between job satisfaction and money found most people would pick a boring job over a stimulating one if they do not think they are being paid enough for the extra efforts , even if they claim otherwise			1
marketing professor @entity111 explored the idea of ' effort aversion ' or why people choose to put less effort into a task even if they do not again as much satisfaction from it			2
another study by @entity30 found most people would pick a boring job over a stimulating one if they do not think they are being paid enough for their extra efforts he said : ' we found even when an effortful job would be more interesting and enjoyable than one requiring less effort , people might price themselves out of the job market because they feel their effort needs to be rewarded			1
' together with researchers from @entity132 , professor @entity111 conducted studies that showed how wages impact a job seeker 's willingness to take on more challenges			1
in the first experiment they asked 144 people which job they would choose from two on offer at a cultural festival			2
the usher role required considerably more effort than the monitor role			0
while 82 per cent of people preferred the job description of the usher role , only 36 per cent would take the job if it payed more than the less demanding monitor position			2
