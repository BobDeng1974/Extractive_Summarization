out : @entity1 politician @entity0 quit the party yesterday following his suspension last week controversial mep @entity0 ‘ quit ’ @entity1 yesterday with an extraordinary parting rant at the party and the journalist who helped bring about his downfall			1
mr @entity0 was suspended by the @entity8 @entity1 last week after causing uproar at the party ’s conference by describing female activists as ‘ sluts			1
’ on the same day he also got embroiled in an altercation with @entity16 reporter @entity15			1
yesterday he said he would sit as an independent mep until next year ’s @entity19 elections , although he will ‘ privately ’ remain a party member			1
in a characteristically provocative intervention he told the @entity22 he was now thinking of taking up shooting , adding that ‘ @entity15 might be the first cartridge , if it is n’t my own party chairman ’			1
his departure means that five of the 13 @entity29 elected in 2009 have now parted company with the organisation			0
mr @entity0 is popular with party members but his headline - grabbing public statements have been the source of growing irritation to @entity1 ’s leadership as it tries to portray a more professional public image			1
last month he provoked accusations of racism by complaining that foreign aid is sent to ‘ @entity42 ’			2
he has also irritated women with a series of sexist remarks , including saying : ‘ i just do n’t think they clean behind the fridge enough ’ - a notorious comment that indirectly led to his downfall			2
when female @entity1 activists at a fringe meeting last friday declared they were too busy to ‘ clean behind the fridge ’ mr @entity0 declared : ‘ the room is full of sluts ! ’ the remark was meant as a joke but provoked a media storm , particularly as mr @entity0 then hit mr @entity15 over the head with a @entity1 conference programme outside the fringe event in a row about racism			1
outburst : @entity1 mep @entity0 said an event to promote women in politics was ' full of sluts ' before falling foul of @entity70 reporter @entity15 ( left ) @entity73 party leader @entity72 said mr @entity0 ’s antics had ‘ destroyed ’ coverage of the party ’s annual conference , and he was suspended from the party just two hours after giving his keynote address as @entity1 ’s defence spokesman			1
in the past @entity1 has delighted in being politically incorrect			2
but the leadership is trying to adopt a more serious image in the run - up to next year ’s @entity19 elections which it believes it could win			1
upset : @entity1 leader @entity72 , pictured , has said he is ' sorry ' @entity0 has left the party mr @entity0 , an mep for @entity86 and the @entity87 since 2004 , yesterday said the ‘ @entity88 ’ was ‘ not really right for me any more ’			1
he said he would continue to support @entity1 , but refused to rule out standing as an independent next year , saying : ‘ never say never ’			1
in a statement he said : ‘ i have felt for some time now that the @entity90 is not really right for me anymore perhaps than @entity91 was right for the @entity93 “ @entity92			0
’ mr @entity72 , who shares a flat with mr @entity0 in @entity95 , said he did not want to see his old friend kicked out of the party altogether as he had not crossed the lines of extremism or racism			2
he said : ‘ i ’m very sorry it has come to this , he ’s been with us for 15 years , he ’s sat in the @entity19 since 2004 , he absolutely 100 per cent believes in everything @entity1 stands for and he ’s been a good , loyal mep for us			1
it ’s a sorry state of affairs			0
‘ all the things @entity107 has said have not been meant in malice but they have all been tremendous distractions from the main messages @entity1 is trying to push out ... nearly everything he has said has been meant as a joke			2
‘ i do n’t want to see him hounded out of the party ... we ’re very clear , racism , extremism , we would n’t tolerate anything like that			0
’ meanwhile , a @entity1 councillor yesterday apologised after making repeated references to ‘ coloured people ’ during a television interview			2
@entity122 - faced : @entity1 suffered further embarrassment when councillor @entity124 , pictured , continually used the offensive term ' coloured ' during a television interview @entity124 , a councillor in @entity127 , insisted he was not racist as he had holidayed in the @entity128			0
during a tv interview he said : ‘ racist i am not			0
i have been to the @entity131			0
i have sampled their hospitality			0
’ apologising yesterday , he said : ‘ when i was growing up , with children from elsewhere , it was quite acceptable			2
you could n’t call them black then but apparently you can now			0
‘ i want to apologise to anyone that was offended			0
it is not something you will hear me say again			0
’ ‘ i want to apologise to anyone that was offended			0
it is not something you will hear me say again			0
