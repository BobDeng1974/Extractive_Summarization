by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 16:28 est , 7 march 2013 workers at a @entity3 tyre - making factory clashed with riot police today as last - ditch protests aimed at saving their jobs turned violent			1
staff from the @entity9 factory in northern @entity3 gathered outside the company 's offices near @entity12 as they continued to rally against attempts to restructure or close the @entity16 plant which employs 1,200 people			1
but as union representatives met with company management inside , protestors fought with police on the streets outside , setting fire to piles of tyres			1
the trouble flared as it was announced that unemployment figures in @entity3 had reached their highest for more than 13 years in the last quarter of 2012			1
it also comes after @entity31 tycoon @entity30 - chairman of @entity31 tyre giant @entity32 - refused to rescue the @entity9 tyre factory because its workers are ' lazy , overpaid and talk too much '			1
the workers were told in january that their factory in @entity16 is to close imminently @entity54 delivered the crushing summary of how some outsiders view @entity3 's work ethic in a letter in the letter released on feburary 19 , mr @entity30 said his company would not be buying a @entity9 tyre plant in @entity16 that is threatened with closure and the loss of 1,170 jobs , telling @entity3 industry ministry @entity65 : ' i have visited the factory several times			1
' the @entity3 workforce gets paid high wages but works only three hours			2
' they get one hour for breaks and lunch , talk for three hours and work for three			0
i told the @entity3 union workers this to their faces			1
they told me that 's the @entity3 way ! ' the letter sent by mr @entity30 sparked a row with the government , with mr @entity83 branding the description ‘ ridiculous ’ , saying that he would instruct government agencies – including the tax office – to examine mr @entity30 ’s business with ‘ redoubled zeal ’			1
@entity9 said on january 31 that it would be closing its main @entity3 plant and cutting its workforce in @entity3 by 39 percent amid labor disputes and plunging car demand in @entity94			1
the issue is now creating unrest in @entity12 as one demonstrator tore away a policeman 's shield while another hit the officer on the head			2
only a spray of tear gas pushed the mob back			0
the tyre firm announced that it was to close the plant at the end of january			1
today 's meetings between unions and management are said to be to discover the findings of an independent report into the social and economic impact that the closure of the plant will have			0
the @entity3 government is proposing to reform the labor regulation that has held up the factory 's closure after five years of attempts by the company to restructure the plant			1
line of defence : police sprayed tear gas at demonstrators in a bid to drive them back burning rubber : officers look on as a demonstrator wearing a @entity9 protest slogan t shirt throws another tyre onto a raging fire running battles : protestors attempt to storm a barricade as police fend them off outside the @entity9 offices in west @entity12 the workers were infuriated last month when tyre executive @entity30 , ceo of @entity32 , said the plant was ' not worth saving '			1
the fortunes of the @entity9 plant are in stark contrast to that of a @entity150 plant just across the road which is going from strength to strength			1
the two plants , whose shared parent is @entity150 , chose different destinies four years ago when @entity150 's unions accepted tougher labour conditions and @entity9 's rejected them			2
now @entity9 faces closure , while @entity150 has received more than 50 million euros in investment			0
@entity163 leaders at the two plants on the outskirts of @entity16 , where riots erupted last august , were friends before a management request to merge the plants and switch to four daily work shifts from three previously tore them apart in 2009			0
scuffle : one worker is seen kicking out at a riot policeman who tries to use his shield to protect himself violence : one protestor was seen taking a policeman 's shield while another threw a punch at him defending the country 's work ethic a fortnight ago , mr @entity65 said that @entity31 was in fact the top foreign investor in @entity3 , with 4,200 @entity31 companies employing nearly half a million people within the country			0
@entity187 has been present in @entity3 since 1842 , @entity188 since 1914 , @entity189 since 1933 and @entity190 since 1974 , while last year companies including @entity192 , @entity194 chocolate and @entity195 chose to invest further in @entity3			0
mr @entity65 added : ‘ but most importantly , in contrast to your ridiculous and derogatory comments , all these companies know and appreciate the quality and productivity of the @entity3 workforce and the commitment , know - how , talent and skills of @entity3 workers			2
’ apparently warning mr @entity30 against further attacks , mr @entity65 wrote : ‘ in the meantime , rest assured that you can count on me to have the competent government agencies survey your imported tyres with a redoubled zeal			0
’ but the government is now facing a growing problem to find a rescuer for the troubled plant			0
heated : a plume of black smoke billows high into the air as riot police stand close to the flames generated by the burning tyres the trouble erupted as it was announced today that @entity3 unemployment figures had reached their highest for more than 13 years			1
the sixth consecutive quarterly increase means that 10.6 per cent of @entity3 residents were unemployed in the last quarter of 2012 , according to the @entity229			0
it also means that unemployment in the country is at its highest since the second quarter of 1999 and is the latest bad news for a government that has admitted it will fall far short of growth and public deficit targets this year			2
the @entity3 economy also contracted by 0.6 per cent in the last three months of the year			0
other data published on thursday showed a widening trade deficit			0
the figures prompted renewed calls from the @entity3 government for action at a @entity94 level to help improve the @entity248 's second largest economy			2
the @entity94 commission has predicted that unemployment in the country will reach 10.7 per cent this year , nearly double the unemployment rate in @entity252 and only slightly behind @entity253 's 11.6 per cent			0
but @entity3 's unemployment rate is still far better than in @entity255 and @entity256			2
president @entity257 took power last may promising to halt a relentless rise in unemployment which has left one in four youths out of work and vowing to restore @entity3 ’s industrial competitiveness			2
the president ’s approval ratings have slumped to around 30 percent since then as his government battles against a tide of factory closures			0
after backtracking last month on growth and deficit targets , he conceded the unemployment goal would now be harder to reach .			0

they were told at the end of january that the plant would close imminently
as union *bosses* met with managers the protest in @entity12 turned violent
