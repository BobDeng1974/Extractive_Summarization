cabinet minister @entity0 today accused the @entity1 of launching a ‘ politically - motivated ’ attack on government plans to cap benefits at £ 26,000			1
in an extraordinary on - air blast , the @entity5 accused the corporation of using ‘ lots of little cases ’ to claim that limiting welfare payments would not get people back to work			1
the confrontation live on @entity15 ’s today programme marks a significant escalation in the political row between mr @entity0 and the @entity1 over reforms to the benefits system			1
clash : work and pensions secretary @entity0 ( left ) accused @entity1 presenter @entity21 of using politically - motivated cases to undermine his welfare reforms from today the maximum amount of benefits a family can claim will be capped at £ 26,000 a year – a figure equal to a pre-tax salary of more than £ 34,000			1
a poll today reveals that almost three - quarters of the public back the cap , with two - thirds saying it will help get people on benefits back into work			1
mr @entity0 was grilled by @entity1 presenter @entity21 , after the today programme aired an interview with one benefits claimant who said she did not want to leave her home in @entity42 to find work			1
as the debate heated up , mr @entity0 insisted many working people who commute long distances every day			1
he added : ‘ the reality is there are plenty of families out there working and paying their taxes who will be asking this question : “ why are we arguing about this , why having a debate as to whether or not somebody should be earning more than they are on welfare payments not working ? ” ’ mr @entity21 intervened to argue : ‘ but that ’s not the point i am putting to you			1
’ mr @entity0 then tore into the @entity1 ’s attempts to undermine his reforms			1
he hit back : ‘ no , cos what you are doing as always happens in the @entity1 is seeking out lots of little cases from people who are politically motivated to say this is wrong			1
’ mr @entity21 said : ‘ there are facts and beliefs and you can believe whatever you like			2
’ the minister responded : ‘ the facts we have got , the fact is that people will not be earning more than average earnings sitting out of work unless they are in the exempt categories			0
‘ the way to resolve that is to go back to work , to earn your money so that as a result of that you no longer are capped			2
this is the incentive to take the right choices , it ’s fair to taxpayers			0
’ incentive : people told their benefits will be capped are already making renewed efforts to find work , mr @entity0 insisted under the benefits cap , couples and lone parents will not receive more than £ 500 a week under the new cap , with single people limited to £ 350 a week			1
the coalition argues it is fair on people who do work and pay taxes that those on state - funded benefits do not receive more than the average working family			2
an @entity107 poll commissioned by the @entity108 found that just 11 per cent of the public think the benefits system is working effectively			2
some 59 per cent said they wanted politicians to do more to cut @entity114 ’s welfare bill			2
a total of 74 per cent said they supported the benefits cap			2
however , during today ’s radio clash mr @entity21 insisted : ‘ we are arguing because it is n’t working			1
nobody argues with the principle , that people who are capable of working , they should work			0
‘ the question is whether your scheme is going to do what it sets out to do , and the evidence such as it is - admittedly little so far - seems to suggest it does n’t work			2
’ @entity132 blundered on @entity133 today when he confused a cabinet minister with a spoof @entity133 account			1
the prime minister , who once warned ' too many tweets might make a tw * t ' , wrote : we 're rolling out a cap on benefits today - @ @entity142 and i are determined to make work pay			1
' but @ @entity145 is not work and pensions secretary @entity0 but a parody @entity133 account based on the minister			1
the clues should have been there			0
the account biography includes ' parodia ' and the phrase ' chin chin old bean '			0
the most recent tweet reads : ' i 've always supported a @entity157			0
your tax buys my mansion			0
@entity161 ! ' this morning the account reacted to the prime minister 's gaffe : ' @entity165			0
round mine for a @entity167 later ? ' mr @entity0 , who repeatedly interrupted to insist his reforms are working , responded : ‘ i believe we are right			2
‘ that what we are seeing , and this is the view of lots of people working in @entity176			0
‘ that they are getting people who were notified of the cap , their belief – this is advisers , they talk to me. , i have been out on the ground , i have seen it myself , i talk to people actually in the @entity186 – our belief generally is that they are going to seek work where they might not have sought work			0
’ relations between the senior @entity191 and the @entity1 deteriorated in april after he was ambushed on air over whether he was challenged over whether he could live on £ 53 - a - week by market trader @entity197 questions were later raised about the true level of mr @entity200 's income			1
mr @entity0 has also heavily criticised the @entity1 's use of the phrase ' bedroom tax ' to describe changes to housing benefit			1
the government says it is ending the ' spare room subsidy ' for people receiving taxpayer support for rooms they do not need			0
but the @entity211 took to using @entity214 's ' bedroom tax ' slogan , which mr @entity0 said was a ' disgrace '			2
however , charities criticised the introduction of the benefits cap			0
@entity219 , chief executive of the @entity220 , accused the government of trying to use a ' blunt instrument ' to solve a complex problem			0
he added : ' the debate around this cap has focused solely on workless adults , but the reality is that children are seven times more likely than adults to lose out			0
' 140,000 children , compared to 60,000 adults , will pay the price as parents have less to spend on food , clothing and rent			0
' we fully support efforts to make work pay			0
but it is not right to do this by putting more children on the breadline			0
instead , the government should do more to help families by tackling the sky high rents in some parts of the @entity114 and making childcare affordable			0

@entity0 clashes with today presenter @entity21
claims @entity1 uses ' little cases ' to claim entire welfare programme is wrong
from today benefits will be capped at £ 26,000 - a - year
