by @entity0 and @entity1 business secretary @entity2 yesterday warned against a premature rise in interest rates @entity2 yesterday warned against a premature rise in interest rates			1
the business secretary sounded the alarm about homebuyers who are being lent mortgages equal to ‘ five times ’ their salary			1
an outspoken critic of @entity13 ’s banks , mr @entity2 questioned whether such super-size loans were ‘ sensible ’			2
he warned that the overheating housing market could lead to a premature rise in interest rates which would jeopardise the recovery			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ there is a risk that the destabilising effects of the rise in house prices , certainly in @entity24 and the @entity25 , potentially has a major impact on the economy as a whole			1
‘ if , for example , interest rates were to rise sooner than they otherwise would have done on the basis of the overall position of the economy , then this potentially is a negative consequence of the imbalance that is happening			1
’ his comments came as the @entity37 gave its strongest signal yet that interest rates will rise before the end of the year – pushing up mortgage costs of millions of families			1
mr @entity2 said a home loan which is five times bigger than a worker ’s salary ‘ must raise all kinds of questions about whether this is sensible for lenders and sensible for borrowers ’			2
mr @entity2 said the ‘ traditional ’ model was to lend around three to 3.5 times ’ somebody ’s salary			2
speaking in @entity24 yesterday at the headquarters of @entity55 , the financial newswire , he said : ‘ what is going on here ? ’ the @entity57 this week said house prices have risen by nearly 19 per cent in @entity24 over the last year			1
this is the second fastest rise in house prices in the capital since its records began , and means the average @entity24 home now costs nearly £ 500,000			1
mr @entity2 said his views were not just ‘ a personal prejudice ’ , and cited the recent warning by the @entity66			2
recently , it said some buyers are ‘ at risk of borrowing more than they can afford to pay ’ , he said			0
in mr @entity2 ’s constituency of @entity73 , the average person who lives in the leafy @entity24 borough and works full - time in the area earns £ 33,000			1
sky high : the @entity57 this week said house prices have risen by nearly 19 per cent in @entity24 over the last year but the average house price is nearly £ 595,000 , according to the property website @entity81			1
if they want to buy a house , they would need to borrow a mortgage which is 18 times bigger than their salary			2
last week , the @entity37 governor also raised his concerns that the mortgage market is ‘ becoming more lax ’ , less than two months since new rules were meant to make it safer			0
around four in ten people who have taken out a mortgage recently are borrowing a loan which is ‘ at least ’ 3.5 times their salary , which is an all - time high			0
one in ten borrowed ‘ at least ’ 4.5 times their salary			0
for example , this means if they earn £ 50,000 , they are borrowing more than £ 225,000			0
the worry is that people are taking out loans that they can afford when interest rates are low , but not when they inevitably go up			1
more than one million people have bought their first home since 2007 , the last time that interest rates were increased in this country			1
there are fears of the ‘ interest rate shock ’ that will hit them because they have never experienced an increase in the cost of their mortgage			2
warning : @entity37 governor @entity116 said that the first increase in @entity118 since 2007 ' could happen sooner than markets currently expect ' the @entity37 yesterday hinted that rates will rise before the end of the year having been frozen at 0.5 per cent since march 2009			2
officials on the panel that sets rates said it was ‘ somewhat surprising ’ that a hike in 2014 was not more widely expected			0
the comments followed last week ’s warning from governor @entity116 that the first increase in @entity118 since 2007 ‘ could happen sooner than markets currently expect ’			0
@entity130 , @entity13 economist at @entity131 , said : ‘ the risk of 2014 hike is clearly growing			0
’ @entity134 , chief economist at @entity135 , said : ‘ clearly savers will be cheered by the rewards that higher interest rates will bring but the big unknown is how households will react to the prospect of more expensive mortgages			1
‘ if consumer spending falls as higher mortgage costs eat into disposable incomes the wider economic recovery could be in jeopardy			0
’ all nine members of the @entity37 ’s rate - setting monetary policy committee voted to hold rates at 0.5 per cent this month , according to minutes of the meeting published yesterday			0
but the report showed that for some the decision ‘ had become more balanced in the past couple of months than earlier in the year ’ – suggesting at least one official is close to breaking ranks			0
the minutes said : ‘ the economy was starting to return to normal			0
part of that normalisation would be a rise in @entity118 at some point			0
’ the @entity37 added that ‘ it still seemed likely that when @entity118 began to rise it would do so gradually and to a level below its pre-crisis average rate ’ of around 5 per cent .			0
