by @entity0 published : 10:42 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 11:33 est , 24 may 2013 the shadow chancellor was a close ally of @entity2 @entity3 says he is ‘ more bothered ’ about passing a grade 8 exam on the piano than serving in the next @entity7 cabinet			1
the shadow chancellor he would ‘ love ’ to be a part of a future @entity7 government but that it is not an ‘ all - consuming passion ’ for him			1
mr @entity3 is widely regarded as one of the most ambitious figures in @entity15 , but in an interview with the @entity17 he says he has already achieved enough that his next career move is not his priority			0
‘ i would love to be part of @entity3 ’s @entity7 government but what i do next for me is not an all - consuming passion			1
' i ’m more bothered , in a personal sense , about getting to grade 8 piano by the time i ’m 50			0
’ mr @entity3 , who is 46 , took his grade 1 exam last year and passed his grade two a couple of months ago			0
asked about his leadership ambitions , mr @entity3 said : ‘ i ’ve played an important role in making the @entity32 independent and the @entity34 agenda in education			0
‘ i ’ve done enough things which i know have made things better , or good , in our country to not feel as though the most important thing is what i do next in my career			0
’ he added : ‘ the danger for a politician is always that you worry that once you ’ve gone your epitaph will say “ hopes unfulfilled ” but i think mine would be “ he did some good things and he did his best ” and that ’s enough			0
’ mr @entity3 used the interview to warn that @entity7 should not rule out holding a referendum on @entity54 ’s relationship with the @entity55			1
he said it is ‘ economically very dangerous ’ for @entity57 to call for a referendum by 2017 ‘ because it leads to great instability and uncertainty ’			2
key change : the shadow chancellor has made steady progress with his piano lessons , which he demonstrated at last year 's @entity7 conference sour note : mr @entity3 claims he could do a better job than @entity69 at tuning up the economy but he added : ‘ i do n’t think we should set our face against a referendum and i certainly do n’t think we can ever afford to give the impression that we know better than the voting public and that we ’re going to carry on regardless			1
’ mr @entity3 also admitted that the last @entity7 government got it wrong on immigration by not restricting immigrants from @entity79 in 2004			1
‘ the problem for @entity7 is the perception , and there ’s some truth in this perception , that the controls were n’t tough enough , ’ he said			2
‘ when they joined the @entity55 , we did n’t have the transitional controls and that was a mistake			2
‘ also , we did n’t do enough to enforce the minimum wage to make sure the agency workers coming from @entity79 could n’t be brought in to do the same job , undercutting the wages of people in the same workplace			0
that caused us a big problem at the last election , there ’s no doubt about that			0
’ duo : there has been speculation that mr @entity3 might not remain in charge of @entity7 economic policy under @entity105 right up to the next election hobbies : the @entity7 heavyweight is also a keen cook and has run the @entity110 marathon twice mr @entity3 also conceded that @entity7 has yet to convince voters it can be trusted with the economy			1
‘ we have n’t won that argument yet , but both @entity69 and @entity57 have lost the argument , ’ he said			2
a spokesman for mr @entity3 said that he is very keen to become the next chancellor and that his comments were intended to indicate that he is more interested in the piano than being @entity7 leader rather than serving in another @entity121			1
‘ it ’s pretty clear what he would like to do on that front , ’ the spokesman said .			0
