trying to ' catalyze change ' : @entity2 ceo @entity1 and his wife @entity1 are donating $ 120 million over the next five years to the @entity6 's public school system @entity2 founder @entity1 and his wife @entity1 are donating $ 120million to the @entity6 's public school system			1
the couple 's gift will be spread over the next five years and is the biggest allocation to date of the $ 1.1billion of @entity2 stock the couple pledged last year to the nonprofit @entity11			1
' education is incredibly expensive and this is a drop in the bucket , ' @entity12 said at @entity2 's @entity16 , @entity17 headquarters			1
' what we are trying to do is catalyze change by exploring and promoting the development of new interventions and new models			0
' the first $ 5million will go to school districts in @entity6 , @entity25 and @entity26 and will focus on principal training , classroom technology and helping students transition from the 8th to the 9th grade			0
the couple and their foundation , called @entity35 : education , determined the issues of most urgent need based on discussions with school administrators and local leaders			0
@entity1 and @entity12 , a pediatrician , discussed the donation in an exclusive interview with the @entity44			1
it was @entity12 's first significant step into the public spotlight and the couple 's premier interview together			0
the two met while studying at @entity51 and married in their @entity53 backyard on may 19 , 2012 â€” the day after @entity2 's stock began publicly trading in a rocky initial public offering that now seems a distant memory			1
in 2010 , they joined @entity57 , an effort led by @entity60 founder @entity59 and @entity62 ceo @entity61 to get the country 's richest people to donate most of their wealth			0
' i 'm really focused on connecting the world			0
that 's my main thing , and you 're primarily focused on children , ' said @entity1 , turning to @entity12			1
' and we 're able to do some of this work together , which is neat ... there are interesting overlaps			0
' @entity12 , 29 , and @entity1 , 30 , have made philanthropy a central theme of their life together			2
the two made the largest charitable gift on record for 2013			0
that $ 1.1billion donation was on top of another $ 500million the couple gave a year earlier to the @entity87 foundation , which helps donors allocate their gifts			2
' i just think that philanthropy is a fancy way to say that you care about others and that you want to serve others			0
philanthropists : the couple have donated more than $ 1billion to the @entity87 foundation , which helps donors allocate their gifts ' and that 's been a part of me for as long as i can remember , ' said @entity12 , fresh from a pediatrics residency shift at the @entity102 , @entity6 medical center , where she works primarily with underserved , immigrant families			2
' ( we ) have this amazing opportunity it 's really important to me that we use this opportunity to continue to give back and create even more change to affect other people 's lives			0
' last year , @entity1 was no 21 on the @entity114 list of the world 's richest people , right behind @entity118 's @entity117 and ahead of well - known billionaires such as activist investor @entity120 and philanthropist @entity122			1
he owns @entity2 stock worth over $ 27billion			1
@entity1 's latest donation comes while questions are still being asked about the success of his $ 100 million @entity128 's public school system in @entity129 four years ago			1
critics say the donation and the chain of events it set in motion has done little to fix the city 's ailing school system			1
observers argue that the process lacked meaningful community input and that much of the money has been spent on high - paid contractors and consultants			1
@entity144 , president of the @entity145 of @entity146 , once said : ' everybody 's getting paid , but @entity148 still ca n't read			1
' @entity1 has been quick to point out that the results in @entity128 are too early to measure			1
he said : ' the schools and programs that the folks put in place , only now are they ramping up and students are starting to go through them			0
' so you wo n't know what the outcomes are until like five , seven , 10 years from now			2
' in 2013 , as the median yearly pay for @entity162 ceos crossed the $ 10million mark amid a widening income gap , @entity1 took a symbolic annual salary of $ 1			1
though it 's been long in the works , the latest gift comes at a time when critics are still questioning what became of @entity1 's $ 100 million donation to @entity129 , @entity128 's public school system			1
four years ago , he announced the donation flanked by then - mayor @entity175 and @entity128 governor @entity176			1
a recent @entity178 article criticises the donation and the chain of events it set in motion			0
while well - intentioned , the money has so far failed to fix the city 's ailing school system			1
the process lacked meaningful community input and much of the money has been spent on high - paid contractors and consultants			1
four years later , the money is nearly gone and a lot of people are angry			2
the story 's most poignant quote is from @entity144 , president of the @entity145 of @entity146 , who says ' everybody 's getting paid , but @entity148 still ca n't read			1
' @entity1 said the @entity129 experience is ' a big influence on our thinking ' with the @entity6 donation			1
taking the long view , he 's quick to point out that the results in @entity128 are too early to measure			1
' the schools and programs that the folks put in place , only now are they ramping up and students are starting to go through them			0
so you wo n't know what the outcomes are until like 5 , 7 , 10 years from now , ' he said			2
' that said , i think there are some things that are going generally better than we 'd expected and some things that we 've definitely taken as lessons			0
' controversy : the donation comes at a time when critics are still questioning what became of @entity1 's $ 100m donation to @entity128 's schools , revealed four years ago by @entity128 governor @entity176 ( left ) and then - mayor @entity175 ( second right ) , seen here with @entity227 at the time of the announcement one of the positive outcomes @entity1 points to : @entity129 's teacher contracts , which , among other things , provide for performance - based pay bonuses for the district 's best teachers			1
he says the contracts are ' better than anything that had been negotiated before ... to reward teachers who were the top performing teachers and hold teachers accountable who were not performing well			0
' @entity1 admits that he and local leaders could have done a better job engaging the community and soliciting ideas about how to spend the money			1
' i think one of the things that we took away from this is that we wanted to do our next set of work in a place where we can engage more directly with the community and a place that we care about a lot			0
the @entity6 just fit that well , ' @entity1 said			2
the couple 's broader philanthropic goals center on children , education and health , though @entity1 is also active in immigration reform			1
last year , he and other tech leaders formed @entity264 , a political group aimed at changing immigration policy , boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research			0
through @entity2 , he 's also spearheading @entity269 , which aims to connect the more than 70 per cent of the world 's 7 billion people who are not yet online			1

@entity1 , who turned 30 earlier this month , said he and @entity12 are inspired by @entity59 and @entity316 and others who believe philanthropy ' is n't just something where you can wake up one day and decide to give away a bunch of money and do it effectively			1
like anything else , you need practice			0
' to help prepare for their charitable work in education , @entity1 and @entity12 decided they needed hands - on experience			1
