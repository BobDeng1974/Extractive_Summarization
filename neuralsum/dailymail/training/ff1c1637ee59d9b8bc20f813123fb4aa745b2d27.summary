a bitter @entity1 row over spending cuts escalated today , as @entity3 claimed the @entity4 are ' all over the place ' on how to tackle the deficit			1
the prime minister joined the war of words as @entity4 treasury minister @entity10 said the @entity11 want to ' inflict unnecessary pain on the people of @entity14 ' and are no longer ' economically credible '			1
together with @entity16 and @entity17 clashing yesterday , it means the four most senior figures in the @entity1 are now at odds about how to repair the nation 's finances			0
prime minister @entity3 claimed the @entity4 were ' all over the place ' while chief secretary to the treasury @entity10 accused the @entity11 of wanting to ' inflict unnecessary pain on the people of @entity14 ' chancellor @entity16 and his @entity4 deputy @entity10 , pictured leaving the @entity24 last week , have clashed over how to tackle the deficit tensions in the coalition have mounted in the wake of mr @entity16 's mini-budget , in which he overhauled stamp duty and targeted non-doms and foreign firms for tax rises , but also admitted dramatic spending cuts were still needed to balance the books			1
the @entity4 sought to insist scrapping the ' slab ' system of stamp duty had been their policy since 2007 , while also claiming credit for increasing the income tax personal allowance to £ 10,600			2
both parties signed up to billions of pounds in spending on roads , housing and flood defences			2
but the prospect of huge spending cuts to eradicate a deficit of £ 91billion has caused bitter divisions			1
the @entity11 say the money can be found entirely through spending cuts , with welfare bearing the brunt			1
but the @entity4 argue a fifth of the money can be raise through extra taxes , including a mansion tax on £ 2million homes			2
mr @entity10 during the growing row with a claim that the @entity11 are gripped by ' pre-election panic ' , resorting to ' pandering to @entity63 ' and pursuing a policy of ' austerity for ever '			1
the chief secretary to the treasury was last week the only senior @entity4 to publicly back the chancellor 's spending measures in the @entity70			2
the @entity11 are furious that @entity71 hailed the @entity70 as ' excellent ' in a meeting for the @entity73 before criticising it in public			0
but writing in the @entity76 , mr @entity10 added to the criticism of the conservatives			2
he said : ' the @entity4 approach is to stay the course we 've set in this @entity82 until the job is complete in 2017 - 18			0
' it is sad to see the @entity78 move away from the sensible , balanced approach of the @entity1 , to a more doctrinaire policy that would inflict unnecessary pain on the people of @entity14			0
' a mix of unfunded tax promises , harsh spending plans and pandering to @entity63 may be born of pre-election panic , but it is not economically credible			1
' deputy pm @entity17 said the @entity11 had to ' come clean ' about the impact of trying to eradicate the deficit from spending cuts alone @entity3 : ' the @entity4 are all over the place , unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it			1
' @entity16 : ' the battle lines for the general election have been drawn this week			0
there 's a clear choice : a competent plan to stay on course to prosperity with us or a return to economic chaos with all the alternatives			0
it 's hard to work out exactly what they ( the @entity4 ) think			2
while they sign up to deficit reduction , they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts			1
' but they should n't pretend to people that the sums required can be achieved by their homes tax alone			0
if you want higher taxes to do the heavy lifting , you 'd also need to increase taxes like income tax or national insurance			0
' @entity17 : ' the conservatives are kidding themselves and seeking to kid @entity14 voters if they are claiming that it is possible to balance the books , deliver unfunded tax cuts , shrink the state and support public services in the way that everybody wants – it just does n't add up			0
the conservatives now need to come clean			0
' @entity10 : ' it is sad to see the @entity78 move away from the sensible , balanced approach of the @entity1 , to a more doctrinaire policy that would inflict unnecessary pain on the people of @entity14			0
' a mix of unfunded tax promises , harsh spending plans and pandering to @entity63 may be born of pre-election panic , but it is not economically credible			1
' the @entity150 waded into the row , using a letter to all @entity154 mps to launch a sustained attack on the @entity4			1
mr @entity3 said their coalition partners were ' unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it '			1
mr @entity3 dubbed last week 's @entity70 as ' distinctly @entity154 ' because it overhauled stamp duty and supported business and said voters face a clear choice ' between competence and chaos '			1
he wrote : ' all @entity167 offer is more of the same : more spending , more borrowing , more taxes , more debt … the @entity4 are all over the place , unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it			1
' chancellor mr @entity16 also defended his blueprint today			0
he told the @entity178 : ' we are going to have to make savings ... we are going to have to cut certain welfare bills like benefits that go to working - age people			0
' but the prize is economic stability , growth , jobs in the future , brighter future , i think that 's a price that works for our country			0
' it was the @entity4 that were ' offering ... a chaotic alternative of higher taxes , higher borrowing and a return to economic chaos ' that would take @entity14 ' back to square one ' , he suggested			0
public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018 - 19 , according to the @entity203 's forecasts of spending cuts yesterday mr @entity16 insisted the measure would do little to balance the books and the @entity4 would have to use other hikes to make up the shortfall			1
' it 's hard to work out exactly what they ( the @entity4 ) think , ' mr @entity16 wrote in @entity212			1
' while they sign up to deficit reduction , they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts			1
' but they should n't pretend to people that the sums required can be achieved by their homes tax alone			0
' if you want higher taxes to do the heavy lifting , you 'd also need to increase taxes like income tax or national insurance			0
' mr @entity17 responded by saying the @entity11 were ' kidding themselves ' and voters over the ' huge ' scale of cuts they would impose if they won the election			2
the deputy prime minister also hit back at claims by chancellor @entity16 that the @entity4 would wreak ' economic chaos ' , and said the @entity11 would have to ' hack back ' education and other services if they were to eliminate the deficit without putting up taxes			2
on @entity240 's @entity239 , mr @entity17 said : ' i think the @entity78 are kidding themselves and seeking to kid @entity14 voters if they are claiming that it is possible to balance the books , deliver unfunded tax cuts , shrink the state and support public services in the way that everybody wants			2
' mr @entity16 said a @entity154 government would save billions on welfare , with initiatives such as restricting child benefit to the first two children in a family			0
he told the @entity212 : ' while [ the @entity4 ] sign up to deficit reduction , they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts			1

@entity4 @entity10 said @entity11 were gripped by ' pre-election panic '
*highlights* how it is increasingly difficult for two parties to work together
coalition partners are in *disagreement* over depth of spending cuts
mr @entity3 waded into the row , claiming @entity4 dems are ' all over the place '
