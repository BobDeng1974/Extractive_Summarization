still , he added , terrorism is n't necessarily contingent upon the mental state of the perpetrator			0

‘ he tried to kill me for no reason and came with milliseconds of getting his wish			0
’ @entity101 said she pulled over and saw the bullet hole in her car door and believes @entity23 was aiming at her rib cage			0
she said he likely would have succeeded had she not been speeding - which drew some laughs from the law enforcement officials standing around her			0
@entity6 attorney general @entity131 said it was a miracle nobody was hurt or killed , but argued that does n't lessen his belief that the terrorism charge and conviction ‘ squarely ’ aligned with the state law			1
@entity6 attorney general @entity131 , center , said it was a miracle nobody was hurt or killed by @entity23 during the shootings in october 2012 ‘ for three days people were intimidated - afraid to take their normal route to work ... or school , ’ he said			1
