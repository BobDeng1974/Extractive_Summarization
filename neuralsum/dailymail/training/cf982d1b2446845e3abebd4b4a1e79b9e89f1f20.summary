among the thousands of men slain on the battlefield at @entity3 , he died , unrecognised and uncelebrated			0
but almost 200 years later , archaeologists have unearthed the remains of the soldier – with the musket ball that felled him still between his ribs			1
historians believe he is from one of the @entity15 ’s @entity14 regiments , and described the discovery of the skeleton as one of the best ever war finds			1
amazing discovery : the almost complete skeleton , found buried on land the @entity14 held , is believed to be a 20 - year - old soldier from one of the @entity15 's regiments who died during the @entity27 cause of death : a musket ball in the soldier 's rib cage is believed to have felled him on june 18 , 1815 they are now hoping that the thick @entity34 mud has preserved his personal items well enough to help them identify him			1
archaeologists have uncovered a regimental spoon , a piece of decorated leather from his uniform , coins , and a piece of wood , possibly a rifle butt , inscribed with the initials ‘ @entity50 ’			1
analysis of the items could lead them to the army , regiment and even the name of the fallen hero			0
@entity34 archaeologist @entity57 said : ‘ the remains were found behind the @entity14 lines close to the infirmary which makes the soldier most likely @entity14			1
‘ the position where the skeleton was found would make it very difficult for it to be from a @entity67 soldier			1
a musket ball was found inside the rib cage			2
this was probably the cause of death – a gunshot wound to the chest			0
‘ we believe that after he was injured he was carried back from the line and that is where he died			0
’ clue : the initials @entity50 carved into a nearby piece of wood - possibly a rifle butt - may help reveal his identity possessions : some coins found by the skeleton 's remains might also help archeologists identify him preserved : a large spoon was also found lying next to the engraved piece of wood the skeleton came to light as @entity34 prepares for the 200th anniversary of the battle that ended the reign of @entity101 and @entity67 ’s domination of @entity103			1
the remains were unearthed during the excavation of plots of land for a car park close to the @entity110 monument , near the hamlet of @entity112			1
sadly the skull was crushed by the mechanical digger before the remains became visible			0
but the skeleton is still one of the best preserved from the battle , although it is missing a foot and some small hand bones			0
@entity101 and his ruthlessly efficient @entity121 once dominated continental @entity103			1
@entity14 - fearing the diminutive general ’s spread of revolutionary republicanism - engaged in seven campaigns against him , losing five			1
@entity101 ’s greatest victory came in 1805 at @entity128 in 1805 , where @entity67 troops killed 19,000 of their numerically superior adversaries while sustaining only 7,000 casualties themselves			2
what made the win even more impressive was that his soldiers completed the rout in just six hours			0
yet , by 1814 , he had abdicated as emporer after failing to encourage the @entity67 to continue fighting following his disastrous 1812 invasion of @entity140			0
but despite his exile in the isle of @entity144 , the great general managed to return to @entity67 , raise an army and fight one last epic battle			0
on june 18 , 1815 , @entity101 led his 72,000 - strong army into battle with 120,000 @entity150 soldiers on the gently rolling plateau of @entity3 in @entity34			1
the @entity150 army was a coalition of @entity14 , @entity153 , @entity155 , @entity34 and @entity156 soldiers			2
the two sides remained in a bloody embrace for several hours that resulted in the slaughter of 9,500 men			0
but at the end of the afternoon the @entity67 emperor 's @entity121 was defeated by the @entity15 and @entity163 , commander of the @entity156 army			0
early analysis suggests the remains are of a 20 - year - old man , who was 5ft 1in tall with teeth worn by biting open gunpowder tubes			1
most of the @entity14 casualties were buried at a cemetery in @entity173 , near @entity174 , but many remained where they fell			1
@entity177 , director of the @entity178 , said : ‘ this is a major discovery			0
' it is the first time for over a hundred years that a complete corpse of a combatant from the time has been discovered in such a good state			2
‘ the body clearly has not been robbed as we found money on him , including a half franc coin from 1811			2
' there were also other coins which we are having analysed			0
‘ he could have been buried by a comrade or simply missed when the bodies were gathered up after the battle for burial			2
‘ we hope to find evidence of his regiment from the spoon and the leather epaulets that were found with the corpse			2
and we know the names of the combatants thanks to military records of the time			0
‘ when the soldier ’s regiment can be determined we should be able to find his identity			0
’ the @entity27 , on june 18 , 1815 , was fought in a sprawling field some ten miles south of @entity174			0
the battle was between @entity67 and the @entity150 armies of @entity14 , @entity155 , @entity153 and @entity34 soldiers under the command of the @entity15 and @entity216 of @entity217			1
the @entity67 defeat drew to a close 23 years of war that had begun with the @entity221 in 1792 and continued with the @entity222 from 1803			2
@entity110 : the body was found on a bulldozed site near the monument to @entity226 last stand : @entity67 emperor @entity101 , who returned from exile to fight the battle in a bid to regain dominance of @entity103 , was defeated by @entity153 , @entity156 and @entity14 troops led by the @entity15 , right @entity233 outfitted warriors : how @entity14 troops looked during the battle as portrayed in the iconic 1970 film @entity3			1
