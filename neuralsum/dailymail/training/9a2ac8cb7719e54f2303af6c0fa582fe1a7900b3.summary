' ms @entity8 started putting on weight rapidly after @entity14 , her only child , was born			1
she said : ' @entity14 was my miracle baby			1
i ’d been told i had polycystic ovaries and conceiving would be difficult , so to have her was a dream come true			0
' after she was born and as she grew older i put all my attention on her			2
i made sure she ate properly and was always healthy , but i let myself slip			0
' i was fairly lazy and did n’t have a good understanding of nutrition , so i would feed myself ready meals , takeaways and processed food - anything that was easy to grab			2
' @entity14 was eating healthy meals but because i was working later hours i would eat separately from her later on			1
' by the time she tipped the scales at 22st , ms @entity8 began to wonder whether she was doomed to be an unhealthy mum forever			2

i was in hospital for two weeks and was n’t able to return to work for six weeks			0

within a month she had lost an impressive 11lb , and her daughter @entity14 began to measure her progress using her special hug test			1
she said : ' it upset @entity14 that i was n’t like all the other mums - that she could n’t get her arms around me and give me a cuddle , something which seemed so normal for her school friends			1
' one day she realised she could bring her fingertips together			0
then , she was able to clasp her hands			0
then she could get her arms around me			2
it was a real motivator			0
' she also wrote me really encouraging notes which i have come to treasure			1

she would snack on chocolate and crisps throughout the day			0
