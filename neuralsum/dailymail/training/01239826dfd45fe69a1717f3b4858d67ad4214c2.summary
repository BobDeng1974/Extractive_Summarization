@entity0 has never forgotten being at home on his couch seven years ago , watching on helplessly as @entity3 grimly clung on for dear life at the @entity5 against @entity6			1
although capped away to @entity7 in june 2007 , @entity0 , then 21 , was excluded from @entity9 ’s squad who bombed at the tournament that september			2
defeats to host nation @entity13 and @entity7 confirmed their pool elimination after an embarrassingly - poor win over unfancied @entity6 was only secured when the television match official ruled @entity18 had somehow managed to hold up prop @entity19 over the line and prevented him from scoring			1
@entity0 has warned against complacency as @entity3 take on @entity6 this weekend the 28 - year - old is refusing to get carried away with @entity3 's 29 - 15 win over @entity24 on saturday ‘ i ’d the chance of being in the @entity5 squad but i was n’t really that close to it , ’ recalled @entity0			1
‘ the whole thing was just a nightmare , that whole @entity5 , and it just went from bad to worse			0
‘ when things started to go a little bit wrong , it was very evident from looking at them [ the @entity3 team ] that they were all in a huge , high - stress situation			1
‘ you can learn from that a little bit			0
it comes back to having a huge amount of confidence in your own ability when things do go bad , never getting too carried away with how bad they can potentially get			2
‘ i ’d like to think — and i genuinely do believe — that we are a very different team to the one that took the field in @entity49 that day			0
@entity3 's @entity50 kicks the ball during the surprise win over @entity24 on saturday @entity24 's centre @entity54 ( centre ) is tackled by prop @entity56 ( left ) and @entity57 ( right ) ‘ you ’ve probably got a better squad , you ’ve got more depth			1
and our mental capacity for the big day is probably a little bit better ; we ’ve had more better performances against some bigger teams over the last 12 months			0
‘ but it has been stressed to us already and it will be stressed to us a lot more throughout the week not to underestimate these [ @entity6 ] guys			2
‘ we ’ll look at a lot of footage of them over the last few months and their players , their key players in particular , and i ’m sure we ’ll see guys who are more than capable of playing a really good standard , ’ he added			0
having emerged from a build - up to last saturday ’s @entity24 game where @entity3 were largely written off , despite having a strong spine available , the wildly - oscillating boom - or - bust psyche surrounding @entity81 rugby was again illustrated yesterday by @entity0 , now suddenly fielding questions about just how good they are with an upcoming @entity87 title defence and the @entity5 next year			1
@entity88 of @entity3 clears the ball down field during the @entity91 against @entity24 in @entity92 however , the 28 - year - old is too wily to buy into the hype that has gone into overdrive in recent days			1
‘ i just stress that it ’s just so important not to get too carried away , ’ he cautioned			2
‘ what happens inside our team room and our meetings is very different to what goes on in newspapers and stuff			0
‘ subsequently , at times when we ’ve been written off , within that room we know we have huge capabilities and know we have it within us to win big games			0
‘ one of the strengths of the quality of players we have and the coaching staff is we all take a pretty realistic view of where we ’re at that moment in time , ’ he added , outlining what he considered a work - on that must be addressed despite the fashion of @entity3 ’s 29 - 15 dismissal of @entity24			1
‘ we did n’t get into their 22 a huge amount and did n’t build too many phases around that area that put us in a position to score some tries			0
