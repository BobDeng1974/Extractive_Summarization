when you consider 80 per cent of our information about the outside world comes through our eyes , it 's hardly surprising studies show eye contact to be the most effective way to signal sexual interest			1
eighteen times more sensitive than our ears , our eyes are capable of responding to one and a half million simultaneous messages			2
so finely tuned , they 'll subconsciously spot when someone starts looking at us - even if we have n't noticed - and start taking mental notes			2
@entity37 is the season for flirting so the perfect time to find out the five eye contact techniques that are scientifically proven to get you noticed ! the four - and - half second @entity42 a normal face scan lasts three seconds , scan for four - and - a - half and it 's clear someone has ' caught your eye '			1
eye contact of more than ten seconds between two people means one of two things : you 're about to fight or have sex ( well , you want to anyway )			1
prolonged eye contact produces intense emotional reactions regardless of whether it 's a fist or a pair of lips heading your way			1
it activates the nervous system , raises our heart rate and blood flow and stimulates the production of certain hormones			2
on average we scan a face for three seconds , scan for four and a half to register your interest the slide and settle studies have shown this to be an almost foolproof way to find out if a stranger is interested in you			1
let your eyes settle on someone so they 're aware you 've noticed them , then as they 're still watching you , slide your eyes around the room before settling back on them again			0
this effectively says , ' you instantly attracted me and you 're still the pick of the room even after i 've checked out the competition			0
' if they 're interested , most people drop their eyes straight down , then directly up again to lock eyes after a few seconds			0
if someone 's eyes instead slide away from yours and do n't return after a minute or two , they 're almost definitely not interested			0
@entity16 says the simple act of blinking can also make someone aware that you 're attracted to them it 's a quick movement - the whole thing 's over in ten to 15 seconds â€“ but it 's impressively accurate			1
the flirting triangle eye movement studies show we look at different parts of other people 's faces depending on the situation and level of attractiveness			1
when looking at strangers or in business situations , we make a small triangle by moving our eyes from eye to eye , dipping them as we move across the bridge of the nose			1
with friends , the triangle widens as our eyes drop below eye level to include the nose and the mouth			2
with lovers and people we fancy , the triangle broadens even further , dropping below the mouth to include the breasts and other good bits like the genitals			0
as flirting becomes more intense , eye to eye contact becomes fast , furious and constant , seconded by long periods spent staring at the mouth			1
our eyes spend the rest of the time making little side journeys to the bits at the bottom of the triangle			0
the blink it 's easy to see where the term ' batting your eyelashes ' originated from : if someone looks at us and likes what they see , they tend to blink more			0
because the brain associates rapid blinking with finding someone sexually attractive , the more you blink at someone , the more attracted you feel to them			2
the function of blinking is to clean the eye and keep the moisture level constant			1
as intense emotion almost always produces tears , it stands to reason our blink rate increases when we 're incredibly happy , sad , attracted or excited as the eye tries to clear excess liquid			2
the lover 's gaze staring directly into someone 's eyes triggers an arousal reaction			0
sadly , this does n't mean you boring a hole into @entity170 's smouldering brown pair will guarantee he 'll gallop you off into the sunset			0
how the arousal develops depends on who is staring at who			0
if it 's an unattractive stranger , it will turn into a fear response			0
but if you like the look of the person looking at you , the brain interprets it as a sexual signal and responds by getting your body ready for sex			1
