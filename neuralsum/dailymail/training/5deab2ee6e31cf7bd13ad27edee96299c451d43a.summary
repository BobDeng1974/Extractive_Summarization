by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 25 april 2012 updated : 01:26 est , 26 april 2012 @entity2 's senior military chief has claimed that @entity3 will decide against building a nuclear bomb as the @entity3 leadership is composed of ' very rational people '			1
lt gen @entity7 said he believes that diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions , along with @entity2 's determination to strike if necessary , will deter @entity3 from pursuing nuclear weapons			1
@entity7 's comments have put him at odds with @entity2 's more pessimistic prime minister , @entity14 , who has complained that international sanctions have not changed @entity3 's behavior			1
lt gen @entity7 's assertion that @entity3 is not building nuclear weapons is in contrast to that of @entity2 prime minister @entity14 but speaking to the @entity24 daily , lt gen @entity7 said : ' i do n't think ( @entity3 supreme leader @entity26 ) will want to go the extra mile			1
' i think the @entity3 leadership is composed of very rational people			1
' at the same time , he warned that @entity2 is moving forward with its preparations to take military action if necessary			2
' we are preparing for it in a credible manner			2
that 's my job , as a military man , ' he said			2
he said this year would be critical in determining whether @entity3 decides to take the final steps needed for a weapon			1
' we 're in a period when something must happen : either @entity3 takes its nuclear weapon to a civilian footing only or the world , perhaps we too , will have to do something			1
we 're closer to the end of the discussions than the middle , ' he said			0
@entity7 's comments contrasted with much tougher statements by prime minister @entity14 , who complained in an interview with @entity52 on tuesday that international sanctions have not changed @entity3 's behavior			1
he told the network that @entity3 continues to enrich uranium - a key step toward developing a weapon			1
leaked documents earlier this year have shown that @entity3 has made significant improvements to its nuclear enrichment facility in the central city of @entity63 the sanctions ' are certainly taking a bite out of the @entity3 economy , but so far they have n't rolled back the @entity3 program or even stopped it by one iota , ' @entity14 said			1
nuclear centrifuges are ' spinning as we speak			0
' so if the sanctions are going to work , they better work soon , ' he said			2
@entity2 and much of the @entity73 believe @entity3 is trying to develop a nuclear weapon			1
but differences have emerged on how to deal with the issue			0
the @entity77 and other major powers have imposed a series of economic sanctions while opening a dialogue with @entity3			1
@entity14 has voiced skepticism about the negotiations , saying @entity3 is merely trying to buy time as it pushes forward with a weapons program , while hinting that @entity2 would be ready to attack @entity3 's nuclear installations			1
@entity2 views a nuclear - armed @entity3 as a threat to its very existence			2
@entity3 claims that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			2
western concern has been steadily building over @entity3 's nuclear capabilities as they develop the @entity63 nuclear enrichment plant @entity14 sarcastically dismissed the denials			1
he cited @entity3 's development of missiles capable of dropping a bomb on @entity2 , @entity3 leaders ' repeated calls for @entity2 's destruction , and fortifying @entity3 nuclear facilities deep underground			2
' nobody can take them seriously , ' he said			0
both @entity14 and @entity7 gave the interviews as @entity2 marked its annual @entity107 for soldiers and civilians killed in violence with @entity112 neighbors - a solemn day that leads into the festive @entity114 at sundown			2
under @entity14 , peace efforts with the @entity117 have ground to a standstill due to disagreements over @entity2 settlement construction in occupied areas claimed by the @entity117			0
in the interview , @entity14 said he is not convinced that @entity117 leaders are serious about making peace with @entity2			0
he said if he believed @entity117 would be ready to compromise for peace , he could convince the @entity2 public to support a peace treaty			0
he said @entity2 has no interest in ruling another people , and that he wants an independent but demilitarized @entity117 state			0
worry : @entity2 prime minister @entity14 has complained recently that international sanctions have not changed @entity3 's behavior he also voiced support for a contiguous @entity117 state - addressing @entity117 fears that @entity14 wants to give them little more than autonomous cantons in the @entity137 separated by @entity2 forces and settlements			1
he said a @entity117 state would not be ' @entity142 cheese			0
' earlier this week , @entity2 president @entity143 told @entity24 that in contrast to @entity14 , he is convinced that @entity117 president @entity145 is a credible partner for peace			0
on wednesday morning , @entity2 stood for two minutes as sirens wailed throughout the country in an annual ritual to remember fallen soldiers and victims of @entity117 militants			0
memorial ceremonies were held throughout the day , bereaved families visited the graves of their dead relatives , flags were at half - staff and radios played somber songs			0
