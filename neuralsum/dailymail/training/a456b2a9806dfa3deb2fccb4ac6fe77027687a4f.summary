@entity48 crime minister @entity47 said : ‘ we can have confidence that @entity3 and @entity4 are safer than they have been for decades , with crime at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981			1
’ the number of reports of sex offences was up 17 per cent , which has been linked in part to the ongoing publicity of abuse cases including that of shamed dj @entity62			2
theft and violent crime saw falls of up to 22 per cent , the latest figures showed the prime minister used @entity35 to congratulate the police on falling crime figures official figures recorded by the police showed a 2 per cent fall in total crime , but this smaller drop has been linked to ongoing concerns about the quality of officers ’ data			2
police figures have been stripped of their official ‘ gold standard ’ status by the statistics watchdog			0
the drop in violent crime comes after a poll published yesterday , which suggested that an increase in alcohol prices is partly responsible for a reduction in binge - drinking and serious violence for the fifth consecutive year			0
