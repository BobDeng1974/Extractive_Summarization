they were a symbol of the @entity3 ’s vision for world domination , produced a lot of dung down in deepest @entity7 … and now , it turns out , have ended up in some ‘ very tasty ’ sausages			1
the mouth - watering , if unfortunate , end of half of the only herd of ‘ @entity15 ’ cattle in @entity14 was revealed yesterday as the farmer who owns them told how he was forced to send seven to the abattoir because they were ‘ incredibly aggressive ’			1
@entity20 , 49 , said : ‘ the ones we had to get rid of would just attack you any chance they could			1
they would try to kill anyone			2
dealing with that was not a lot of fun at all			0
they arrived in @entity43 for the first time in 2009 when mr @entity20 imported 13 cows the cows in question are a relic of @entity40 ’s support for a scheme to revive the mighty auroch – a huge beast which featured heavily in @entity54 folklore			1
the aurochs had been hunted to extinction in @entity57 by 1627 , but two zoologist brothers decided to ‘ bring them back to life ’ in a breeding plan which later won @entity15 support			1
@entity63 and @entity64 mixed animals from the @entity66 , @entity67 and the @entity68 , as well as @entity70 fighting bulls			2
after the fall of the @entity74 , the @entity72 cattle were seen as an unwanted reminder of @entity77 oppression and efforts to build a master race , and almost all of them were destroyed			2
but a few survived , and 13 were shipped from a conservation park in @entity84 to mr @entity20 ’s farm at @entity86 on the @entity7 - @entity88 border in 2009			1
it was the first time the beasts had been seen in @entity43 for more than 4,000 years			0
but yesterday mr @entity20 said he ‘ could n’t handle ’ the rogue members of the herd , adding : ‘ what the @entity77 did with their breeding programme was create something truly primeval			2
the aurochs were wild bulls			0
’ the @entity99 ’ programme was so successful the cows flourished and were used in propaganda material during the @entity102			2
mr @entity20 says they are shorter than the aurochs , but retain their half - ton ancestors ’ muscular build and lethal horns			1
mr @entity20 , a father of two , said he had to reduce his herd ( pictured ) because the cows had tried to kill some members of his staff and would ' attack at any chance they could '			1
they have now been sent to an abattoir mr @entity20 said the cows he sent to the abattoir will be turned into sausages and will be sold in @entity57 he added : ‘ as far as being a commercial breed is concerned , they have little value , but they are a significant animal from a conservation point of view			1
for instance , each cow can produce its own weight in dung every year , which is a great source of food for insects and bugs and nutrients for the environment			2
’ but he added of the aggressive ones : ‘ i have worked with a range of different animals from bison to deer and i have never come across anything like these			0
‘ to get them into the trailer to get them off the farm we used a young and very athletic young man to stand on the ramp and they charged at him before he quickly jumped out the way			0
' when the @entity77 were selecting them to create this animal they used @entity70 fighting cattle to give them the shape and ferocity they wanted			0
the @entity35 breed was brought ' back to life ' under orders by @entity40 ( pictured ) in the 1930s the half - tonne cattle died out in @entity43 4,000 years ago but remained widespread across much of @entity57 until the 1600s			1
however , they were finally wiped out in 1627 after they were hunted to extinction for their horns , hide and meat			0
they were saved in the early 1930s when @entity40 wanted to recreate the breed to evoke the power of the ' runes , folklore and legends of the germanic peoples '			1
@entity63 and @entity64 found their descendants in a cattle from the @entity66 , @entity67 and the @entity68 , as well as @entity70 fighting bulls			1
they then identified the particular @entity35 gene , which they were able to use to bring them back from the ' dead '			1
the cows were later transported to game parks in @entity184 near @entity185 , and the @entity186 in @entity187			0
mr @entity20 said : ' the @entity35 were wild bulls			1
@entity189 recorded them as being bulls as big as elephants			0
' young men hunted these bulls as preparation for battle and leadership in war , but also to obtain these huge 6ft - wide horns that the bulls had as drinking vessels and war horns			0
' ' the reason the @entity74 were so supportive of the project is they wanted them to be fierce and aggressive			0
' since they have gone it is all peaceful again			0
peace reigns supreme on the farm			0
' despite these problems , i have no regrets at all			0
it has been a good thing to do and the history of them is fascinating			0
' the meat from the slaughtered cows was turned into sausages which mr @entity20 said were ‘ very tasty ’ – and a bit like a cross between venison and beef			1
they will be sold in @entity57 , he said , but probably not marketed as ‘ @entity15 sausages ’			1
he explained : ' i 'm not sure how appealing @entity15 sausages would be but they might be popular with some			1
' they are very tasty though and taste like a cross between beef and venison and are sought after in @entity231 and @entity77			0
they are a different product with low fat and cholesterol			0
' i do n't imagine any of them are sold locally but we are looking in the future to create a speciality market for them			0
' but we need to get to a stage where it is a manageable herd that can be used for normal farming			0
' @entity40 saw the ' super cows ' as a symbol of @entity77 and @entity247 might and tasked leading geneticists , brothers @entity63 and @entity64 , to bring the @entity35 ' back into existence '			1
the pair traced the species ' descendants to domestic breeds and managed to ' pull the wild genes out ' in a @entity257 - style experiment			0
the @entity259 ' programme at zoos in @entity185 and @entity261 was so successful that the new @entity35 flourished and were used in propaganda material during the @entity102			2
mr @entity20 , a father of two , said his cows were slightly shorter than the original @entity35 , but retain their ancestors ' muscular build , deep brown complexion , and shaggy coffee - coloured fringe			1
he added : ' importing the cattle has been an interesting project for us - they have such an unusual history			2
' there was a thinking around that time that you could selectively breed animals for @entity247 characteristics , which were rooted in runes , folklore and legend			0
' heck cattle were the product of an attempt to back - breed using a number of existing older species , including @entity70 fighting bulls , @entity288 and @entity289			1
' the cattle , which have lethal - looking horns and a muscular build , are unlike any modern commercial breed of cow			1
they were almost destroyed following the defeat of @entity297 in 1945 , but some survived after they were shipped to game parks in @entity57			0
mr @entity20 said : ' as far as being a commercial breed is concerned , they have little value , but they are a significant animal from a conservation point of view			1
' for instance , each cow can produce its own weight in dung every year , which is a great source of food for insects and bugs and nutrients for the environment			0
' the @entity35 was extinct , but domestic descendants - @entity315 , simmentals and everything else - were still kicking around the countryside			2
' the two brothers argued that if the one wild animal that spawned all of these had gone , through a process of back - breeding domestic cattle , you could pull the wild genes out and recreate the ancestor			2
' between the two wars , there was a thinking that you could selectively breed animals - and indeed people - for @entity247 characteristics , for characteristics that were rooted in runes , folklore and legend			2

farmer @entity20 imported 13 ' @entity64 ' cattle from @entity84 to @entity32 , @entity7
he has now been forced to get rid of seven of the cows *due* to their nature
49 - year - old said they had tried to kill his staff and ' attack at any chance '
@entity35 breed - *dubbed* @entity15 cows - brought back by @entity40 in 1930s
father of two said cows would be turned into meat and *joked* : ' i 'm not sure how appealing @entity15 sausages would be but they might be popular '
