new drug : @entity3 , when taken in combination with the current treatment options , cures up to 90 per cent of patients experts have declared the end of hepatitis c , thanks to a three - month course of tablets that could see the killer blood disease eradicated from @entity12			1
the development of @entity3 ( sofosbuvir ) has been hailed as a ‘ game - changer ’ in the treatment of the illness			1
‘ this new drug gives us the opportunity to clear hepatitis c from the @entity12 , ’ says @entity17 , professor of hepatology at @entity18			1
@entity22 is a blood - borne virus that was first identified in 1989			1
many of those affected received contaminated blood from transfusions or medical procedures prior to 1989 , or by sharing needles or having tattoos			1
famous sufferers include @entity31 founder @entity30 , who died of a brain haemorrhage in 2007 , and former baywatch star @entity33			0
the virus is estimated to affect 215,000 adults in the @entity12 , of whom more than half remain undiagnosed			1
untreated , it rots the liver and , over a period of 30 to 40 years , leads to cirrhosis and liver cancer			0
death rates have been rising rapidly			0
in 2011 there were 381 deaths from hepatitis c , but it now kills more people than diseases related to @entity50			0
until now , treatments , which can last up to a year , have been fairly effective , with a 60 to 70 per cent cure rate			2
but they have unpleasant side effects			0
@entity3 , when taken in combination with the current treatment options – injections of interferon and ribavirin tablets – cures up to 90 per cent of patients in just 12 weeks , and is tolerated by almost everyone			1
prof @entity17 says : ‘ if we treat 20,000 patients every year for the next ten years , nobody will transmit the virus and it will be gone			2
‘ @entity22 mutates every time it copies itself , making treating it like hitting a moving target			1
‘ @entity3 hits at the enzyme at the very heart of the virus , stopping it from mutating or becoming resistant			0
’ the drug is now awaiting approval from watchdog @entity74			2
at a cost of £ 35,000 for a 12 - week course , it is not cheap , but experts are optimistic it will be seen as cost - effective			2
‘ it is estimated that hepatitis c currently costs the @entity86 £ 156 million per year , ’ says @entity82 , professor of hepatology at @entity83			2
blame game : sufferer @entity33 claims she got @entity22 from her ex-husband @entity88 after they shared tattoo needles prof @entity17 adds : ‘ later this year we expect to see the availability of other new drugs , which we can combine with sofosbuvir			1
this will allow us to stop using interferon , which causes the worst side effects and ca n’t be tolerated by the sickest patients			0
‘ studies show these new drugs administered with sofosbuvir have a 97 per cent success rate			0
it ’s possible the treatment period will go down to a few weeks			0
’ there is just one shadow on the horizon : the low hepatitis c detection rate in the @entity12 , which means many of those needing treatment will not be identified until they are seriously ill. the @entity12 has no comprehensive screening programme , meaning we lag behind other @entity114 countries and the @entity115 in identifying sufferers			1
‘ we need a proper screening programme if we are to gain full benefit from these drugs , ’ says prof @entity82			0
@entity120 , chief executive of the @entity121 , says : ‘ this will be a huge step forward for patients towards the goal of short , easy - to - tolerate treatments that will cure hepatitis c in almost everyone who takes them			1
‘ we will be able to stop thinking of the virus as a chronic illness leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer and think of it instead as a nasty virus that is easily treatable			0
i hope this means that many more people will think about getting tested			0

@entity22 is estimated to affect 215,000 adults in @entity12
