catch him if you can			0
unfortunately for the entire @entity5 field in 2014 , keeping pace with @entity3 has proved totally impossible this season			1
the world champion made it 10 wins from as many races this year after triumphing at @entity11 on sunday			1
the defending world champ shattered the series ’ previous record for the youngest driver to win 10 in a row			0
@entity17 was 24 years and 86 days old when he did it in 1964			0
@entity3 is 21 years , 174 days			0
with his dominance so great , questions of whether he will retain the title have long since passed - replaced with whether the @entity22 can clean sweep all 18 races this term			2
@entity3 is the first rider since @entity25 in 1997 to win 10 successive premier class races			0
for instance , @entity3 is in just his second year of @entity5 - winning the title in his rookie season			1
and while he rides a factory @entity41 - arguably the best bike in the field - he is consistently leaving team - mate , @entity57 for dust at every grand prix			2
@entity57 is n't the only one struggling to keep pace with the 21 - year - old			1
seven - time premier class world champion @entity45 and team - mate @entity43 also ca n't beat @entity3 this year and the @entity44 pair , as well as @entity57 , are among the finest riders the sport has seen - at least in recent times			1
clear the way : @entity3 won the @entity5 championship in his rookie season in 2013 and is set to dominate the sport in the future with his aggressive riding style coming through : @entity3 ( 93 ) shows little fear when overtaking as he scythes past @entity43 ( 99 ) and @entity45 to take the lead at @entity11 first choice : @entity3 is tied down to ride with @entity41 for the foreseeable future , with rivals including @entity43 ( right ) struggling to match his pace on track video @entity3 : 2013 @entity81 highlights @entity82 : three ( 2010 - 125 cc ) , ( 2012 - @entity81 2 ) , 2013 - @entity5 ) @entity84 pole position in @entity5 : 20 years , 62 days @entity84 winner in @entity86 : 20 years , 63 days youngest rider to take a fastest lap in the @entity86 : 20 years , 49 days ( @entity89 2013 ) youngest rider to win at least 1 race in 3 classes of @entity93 first rookie to win 4 races back to back in @entity86 : ( @entity98 - @entity97 - @entity11 - @entity96 2013 ) youngest rider to set fastest times in every session from a @entity103 @entity102 : ( @entity11 2013 ) most wins as a rookie in @entity86 : 6 most pole positions as a rookie in @entity86 : 9 most podium finishes in rookie season of @entity86 : 16 most podium finishes in single season of @entity86 : 16 ( shared with @entity45 , @entity112 and @entity43 ) most points scored as a rookie in @entity86 : 334 first rookie to take 4 consecutive pole positions in @entity86 youngest rider to win the title in @entity86 : 20 years , 266 days first rider to win intermediate class and premier class titles back to back second rookie to win premier @entity86 title ( after @entity125 in 1978 ) first rider in @entity5 era ( 2002 - ) to win first 10 races of a season @entity130 to win 10 races in a row in @entity86 : 21 years , 174 days most pole positions from start of season in 4 @entity5 ( 2002 – ) era : 6 most consecutive race wins in premier class ( 1949 – ) era : 10 ( shared with @entity25 and @entity140 ) only rider @entity5 era to win 6 successive premier class races from pole since making his debut , last year , @entity3 has finished on the podium in 26 of his 28 races - the two anomalies include a rare crash at @entity149 last season , as well as a team mix - up resulting in his disqualification at @entity153 , @entity154			1
it 's a level of dominance that should on paper be boring , but @entity3 's riding this year has not been simple lights to flags victories - he really has had to work for some of his wins			2
his poor race starts need attention for instance , and it often leads to the @entity22 falling well out the top three on the first lap , whether he qualifies on pole or not			0
but he has proven time and again this term he is more than capable of fighting through the field			0
among the highlights of his victories include @entity174 where he came from 10th to pass @entity45 and sprint off into the distance with half the race still to go			0
. my time is now : @entity3 has built up a large fan following in @entity5 as he bids to take the sport into a new era still got it : @entity45 has won just one race in the last four seasons but is still among the top riders in the sport at 35 - years - old top dog : @entity45 is still the most popular rider in the paddock having won an impressive seven premier class titles since 2001 while at the @entity188 in @entity98 , he pitted before the race to switch on to dry tyres , but still scythed through the field unchallenged to claim victory			1
his biggest test came at @entity149 where late on he exchange in a highly entertaining duel with @entity43 , beating his @entity197 compatriot by just 0.1 of a second			0
since the start of the century , @entity5 's golden boy has been @entity45 who still is by far the most popular rider even if his best days are coming to an end			2
the @entity203 is a global ' fan favourite ' but despite signing a new two - year deals with @entity44 , talks of who will lead the sport in the future have been asked for some time			2
@entity112 has come and gone , @entity57 and @entity43 have led a challenge but @entity3 's total dominance which has seen him smash records left , right and centre surely pave the way for the start of an exciting new era in the premier class of motor cycle racing .			1

@entity3 continued *perfect* start to the @entity5 season after winning tenth straight race at @entity11
@entity41 rider continues to dominate sport since becoming world champion in 2013 - his rookie season
rivals including @entity45 , @entity43 and @entity57 struggling to match 21 - year - old 's pace
@entity3 on course to clean sweep 2014 season and dominate the future
