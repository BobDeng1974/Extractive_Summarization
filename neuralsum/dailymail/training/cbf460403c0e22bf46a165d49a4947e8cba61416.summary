by @entity1 reporter last updated at 6:45 pm on 28th october 2011 nowadays quirky weddings are all the rage , with couples being read their nuptials anywhere from hot - air balloons to under the ocean			1
but meet the @entity8 , who 20 years ago were ahead of their time with a bizarre marriage stunt			1
in 1991 @entity11 and @entity12 won a radio competition 's ' mystery prize ' , meaning they spent the evening after they tied the knot circling the @entity18 in a huge bus			1
@entity12 and @entity20 who spent their wedding night driving around the @entity18 in a coach their odd story has emerged in a @entity27 documentary about the @entity18 being screened on its 25th anniversary tomorrow			1
today mr @entity12 , 44 , a metal polisher from @entity30 , @entity31 , spoke of their delight after they were picked for the unusual stunt			1
' they told us the night before that we would be travelling at 50mph			1
' my wife was thinking we were going to be on the @entity40			1
' instead , after their wedding in @entity44 on march 27 , 1991 , they were driven to the newly opened @entity46 service station for the reception			1
then came their big treat : a bus arrived to take them and their guests around the full 114 - mile length of the @entity18			1
@entity54 on the happy day in march 1991 four hours and one complete circuit later , the guests were dropped off - and the happy couple were driven around the orbital twice more			1
' there was a massive four - poster bed fitted into the bus , with a tv , video and ice box			1
it was a bumpy night ... but quiet , ' said mr @entity12			2
eventually the bus pulled back into the service station where the couple enjoyed a hearty fry - up			2
mrs @entity20 , 43 , a self - employed cleaner , said she was ' shocked ' when they found out what lay in store on their wedding night			2
the love bus : the happy couple take to the wheel , in a quirky story which will be remembered in a documentary about the @entity18 but she soon realised she 'd be just as happy being mrs @entity20 on a bus as she would in a five - star hotel			2
' as long as we were going to be together , that 's all that mattered			2
' most people want to see the back of the @entity18 as quickly as possible			2
i just hope i 'm never stuck on it			0
i do n't want to tarnish the memories			0
' the @entity18 took more than 11 years to build at a cost of £ 1 billion			0
it was opened by the then prime minister @entity90 to a fanfare on october 29 , 1986			0
another £ 1 billion is now being spent on an expansion that will see the motorway grow to eight lanes wide in parts			0
the documentary , the road to nowhere , tells how house prices have gone up 300 - 400 per cent since the @entity18 opened , making huge profits for the landowners whose farmland was snapped up by developers			0
its construction saw a big influx of @entity106 companies attracted to @entity106 - style business parks that sprang up near the route			0
the @entity18 was also the centre of an illegal rave scene that developed shortly after it opened			0
