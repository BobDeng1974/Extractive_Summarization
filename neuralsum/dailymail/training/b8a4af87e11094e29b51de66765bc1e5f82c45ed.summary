by @entity0 published : 08:55 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 10:07 est , 2 december 2013 president @entity2 's beleaguered health care programme has received a ringing endorsement - from @entity5 's legal prostitutes			1
the controversial scheme - otherwise known as @entity7 - is accused of being too expensive by some critics and faced anger after crippling glitches on its website prevented many from signing up when it first launched			2
but the @entity7 has enabled the legal prostitutes to get health insurance cover for the first time			1
high price : @entity19 , owner of the @entity20 , center , says @entity7 is good for the legal prostitutes working in his brothel , but will cost him a fortune in extra tax ' having this profession , we are n't exactly offered group health insurance ... i 'm excited , ' @entity28 , who works at @entity20 , told @entity5 's news4			1
ms @entity28 said she had repeatedly refused health cover prior to @entity2 signing the statute			1
@entity5 is the only state in @entity33 where , under certain strict circumstances , prostitution is legal			1
risk : @entity33 president @entity2 has staked his political legacy on the @entity7 , otherwise known as @entity7 but despite working within the tightly controlled and regulated brothels , many of the women found they were nonetheless shunned by health insurers , until now			1
@entity43 told news4 : ' they equate us to illegal working girls who have very high @entity48 's and @entity49 rates which we have none of the above			0
we 're legal , licensed prostitutes			0
she added : ' we 're independent contractors			0
we have to get our own insurance but this is truly a blessing			0
' ' blessing : @entity5 's legal prostitutes say @entity7 , which extends health insurance to millions of @entity33 previously shunned by the health care industry , is a ' blessing ' but to pay for the extension of health insurance , the @entity7 includes new taxes on high - earners , the healthcare industry and large businesses - including the brothel 's owner			1
@entity19 claims the new healthcare system will cost him , as an owner of seven separate brothels - all employing about 15 people each - a strip club , restaurants and a truck stop , across the state , a fortune			2
he told news4 : ' i 'm the sole stockholder but because i 'm the owner for all these different businesses , they lump them together			0
' what am i going to do ? i 'm either going to have to spend a lot of money on health insurance because the rates are going up or i 'm going to have to face severe penalties , so i 'm really perplexed about all of this			0
' criticism : @entity2 's @entity7 has been slammed after the signup page on the @entity93 kept crashing after it was launched the @entity20 , in @entity95 , @entity5 , is @entity33 's most famous brothel and featured on @entity98 's chat show			1
working girl @entity99 gave the crew a guided tour of the ranch where punters can legally pay for sex - including its on - site sexual health clinic			0
the blonde took the cameras inside the room where the 500 girls who are licensed to work at the ranch are tested for sexually transmitted diseases every week and @entity112 once a month			0
@entity7 has antagonised many @entity113 and those on the @entity115 because it is seen as too much state interference , extremely expensive and inefficient			2
while lower - income people could see lower costs because of government subsidies , many in the middle class risk a rude awakenings when they access the websites to discover they may have to pay significantly more			0
but many have welcomed the changes as the first time millions of @entity33 will have access to health care insurance .			2
