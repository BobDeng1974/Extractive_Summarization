by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 5 november 2013 @entity2 star @entity1 tested positive for a banned substance in 2006 , sources linked to baseball 's drug tests have revealed			1
but the damning results were never disclosed because a @entity9 player must fail two drug tests before his name is released			2
the 38 - year - old 's legal team has denied the claims and has accused senior baseball officials of leaking the evidence because they are ' desperate ' to win the drug arbitration case against the athlete , the @entity12 reported			1
the revelations have also raised concerns about the credibility of past statements the player has made about his connection with performance - enhancing drugs			0
confidential : @entity2 ' star @entity1 tested positive for a banned substance in 2006 , but his name was not released because of @entity9 drug test regulations the third baseman is in the middle of a heated legal battle to overturn the 211 - game ban handed down by @entity9 in august to him and 13 other players			1
he was given the suspension after violating doping regulations in the league 's collective bargaining agreement and is the only player challenging the decision			1
the uncovering of the failed drugs test will not lead to any further sanctions by the league , because players are only banned after their second substance offence , but his legal team claim it will damage his reputation even further			1
@entity51 , a lawyer for the three - time @entity52 , did not address whether @entity1 had a positive test , only that he was not banned as a result			1
he said : ' @entity1 was never suspended for use of stimulants or any violation of the @entity9 drug program			2
' the fact that @entity9 has resorted to leaking federally protected medical information about a player speaks volumes of the weakness of their case against @entity1 - and their desperation to secure a win in the arbitration , at all costs			1
@entity70 , former boss of @entity71 anti-aging clinic biogenesis , is the star witness in the @entity9 case against @entity1			2
it has been alleged @entity70 supplied baseball superstars with banned substances in a statement , @entity76 a former @entity78 administration official working for @entity1 's legal team , called for a government probe into @entity9 's methods			1
the league has admitted paying for documents and @entity1 's lawyers have claimed baseball 's representatives have intimidated witnesses			2
' @entity90 authorities should initiate an investigation as to whether any federal crimes have been committed by @entity9 investigators as well as those in the commissioner 's office who may have been complicit in this misconduct			1
' his legal representatives also claim that the player has abided by the confidentiality laws set out in the drugs agreement , while the league have gone against it			1
when he arrived at spring training in 2008 , @entity1 said : ' last year , i got tested 9 to 10 times			0
... we have a very , very strict policy , and i think the game is making tremendous strides			0
' the new revelation comes just three weeks after it was revealed the player paid $ 305,000 to buy evidence and hide potentially incriminating links to @entity70 , the @entity71 clinic behind baseball 's doping scandal			2
as the proceeding to end the dispute between @entity9 and @entity1 reached its halfway point , it was revealed @entity1 handed over cash for documents that included videotapes and affidavits that could incriminate him or be used in defense against doping allegations , the @entity118 reported			2
@entity1 is the only player contesting the ban and is allowed to play for the @entity2 during his appeal			0
a source with knowledge of the closed - door proceedings , held in @entity9 's @entity137 @entity136 offices , told the @entity118 that @entity1 and his representatives confirmed during sworn testimony that @entity1 forked over the $ 305,000 to buy the evidence from @entity70 - a claim that boosts @entity9 's case against the fallen star			1
but with @entity9 seemingly set to strike out @entity1 , @entity1 's team hit back with a counter claim that the league also paid cash to @entity70 for its own evidence in the case			1
the @entity150 claims its own source revealed that @entity9 chief operating officer @entity152 testified on thursday that he authorized a payment of $ 125,000 in cash in return for documents from the @entity71 clinic			2
but @entity1 's legal team denied the allegation the 38 - year - old third baseman paid any money to acquire data from the disgraced anti-aging clinic			1
' the notion that we paid any money for any @entity70 documents is patently false , and anyone who is leaking this information knows it ’s false , ' said a-rod attorney @entity170			0
but a third source told the @entity150 the tit - for - tat claims over cash payments was all about the detail			0
@entity1 apparently did acquire copies of @entity70 information but did not pay for it , a point that shows just how much the he - said she - said desperate details of the proceeding have turned ugly			0
@entity1 strikes out against the @entity182 at @entity183 in september			0
his 211 - game ban is not in effect while he appeals the decision			0
@entity1 's career could be on the line as the @entity9 doping dispute gets ugly and uglier a @entity150 source claimed @entity152 's testimony stated a member of @entity9 's investigation team made one payment of $ 100,000 and a second payment of $ 25,000 to @entity196 , a former @entity70 employee , for information stolen from @entity70 founder @entity70			1
after receiving his 211 - game ban based on connections to @entity70 , @entity1 sued @entity9 and included in his filing that : ' @entity201 of @entity9 purchased what were represented to be these stolen documents for $ 150,000 in cash , which was handed off in a bag at a @entity208 , @entity71 area restaurant			0
' @entity9 denied those allegations and said : ' none of those allegations is relevant to the real issue : whether mr. @entity1 violated the @entity213 and @entity214			0
' @entity9 coo @entity152 said that if the league did buy evidence from third parties it was to reveal the illegal activities of players @entity152 said @entity9 buying evidence was legal			1
' there is nothing wrong with purchasing documents in an investigation , ' he told the @entity118			0
' we did it in the course of trying to see if we had players using performance - enhancing drugs in violation of our agreement			2
i ’ve acknowledged it previously			0
' arbiter @entity235 is expected to rule in december whether @entity1 ’s suspension by @entity9 will be hit out of the park or stand firm			0
if confirmed , the ban will be the longest in @entity9 history			0
@entity1 's career - and legacy - depend on the decision .			0
