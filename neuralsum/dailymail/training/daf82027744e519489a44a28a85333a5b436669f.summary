by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 13:04 est , 1 june 2012 disgusted parents today condemned primary school teachers after they set their young children the task of memorising a ' thuggish ' song about threatening to kill people			1
pupils at @entity8 , in @entity9 , were told to learn the lyrics to the song entitled ' we 're going to kill you ' about the @entity14 as part of a project linked to the @entity17			1
but the words more closely resembled a gangster rap than an educational singalong with most of the verses referring to extreme violence			2
violent words : excerpt of lyrics from a song about killing people that were given to children at @entity8 in @entity9 who were then told to memorise the words @entity8 : the song sheet distributed to ' impressionable ' pupils at the village school included the lyrics : ' we 're going to kill you ' and ' i 'll break your arms and legs ' lines in the song , taken from a play called @entity44 : the legend of @entity46 , include : ' you think you ’ve got a chance , you think you ’ll make us dance , but when you make your stance , we ’re going to kill you			1
' you think you ’re really tough , that you have trained enough , but we do n’t give a stuff , we ’re going to kill you			0
' i 'll break your arms and legs , i 'll make it that you ’ll beg , for me to stop the pain , think again			0
apology : @entity54 , head - teacher at @entity8 in @entity9 , apologised for the ' unsuitable ' song lyrics ' you think you 're going to win , i tell you think again , i ’ll put you in a spin , we 're going to kill you			1
' i 'm afraid your time is up , i think it 's time to ruck , so it 's time that we showed our stuff , so the going just got tough , let me know when you 've had enough , we 're going to kill you			0
' i 'll break your arms and legs , i 'll make it that you beg , for me to stop the pain , think again			0
' furious parent branded the song ' thuggish ' and claimed the teacher could not justify such lyrics being handed out to ' young and impressionable children '			1
the first @entity44 games , which started in 776 @entity73 , featured running , boxing , wrestling , and pankration - a type of martial art. the fights could be very brutal as they had no rest periods and no rules against hitting a man while he was down			0
the bouts continued until one man either surrendered or died but contenders tried to avoid killing their opponent as the dead boxer was automatically declared the winner			2
but the ancient @entity44 were not just about sporting events but featured songs , plays and poetry as well			0
the ancient olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event and were held in honor of the @entity96 god @entity95			0
artistic expression was a major part of the @entity17 and sculptors , poets and other actors would come to the @entity17 to display their works			2
the play chosen by the school was a fictional tale based around a story written by a @entity96 traveller @entity108 , that described ancient @entity110 and the games , around 150 ad and translated by @entity112 of @entity113 in 1918			0
the play charts the adventures of @entity46 who could n't attend the games because she was a married woman so donned a wig so she could go and help her son to become an @entity120 champion			0
inappropriate : parents criticised the choice of song to to rouse @entity120 spirit among pupils the play book , which features many other songs as well as ' we 're going to kill you ' , which can be purchased online through numerous school education websites			1
but @entity131 , the father of one of the school 's pupils , said : ' i ’m furious that anyone would allow children to recite , rehearse and sing this song			1
' it ’s supposed to support the @entity44 , and this certainly is n’t in the @entity120 spirit			0
' children need a good education at an early age , not learning thuggish lyrics in school			1
' but the school ’s headteacher , @entity54 , has defended the lyrics , saying they were contained in a published educational musical about the @entity14 that the school planned to produce to tie in with the @entity17			1
however , they have withdrawn the song following concern from angry parents			1
ms @entity54 said : ' as soon as their unsuitability was brought to my attention , i told staff they must be withdrawn and re-written			2
' i can only apologise to anyone who has been offended by these lyrics , and trust they have been reassured by our swift action to redress the mistake			2

song was part of a musical production set to be performed by pupils
outraged parents brand violent lyrics about killing as ' thuggish '
@entity176 in @entity9 has now withdrawn the song from *classes*
