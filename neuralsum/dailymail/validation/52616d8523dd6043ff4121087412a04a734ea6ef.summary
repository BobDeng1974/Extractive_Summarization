all foreign nurses , midwives and dentists will have to pass tough new @entity4 language checks before being allowed to treat patients in the @entity6			1
@entity8 trusts will be required to check the language competency of all their healthcare workers , before they are given licence to practise in the @entity6			1
the move marks an extension of legislation introduced early last year , which demands that all foreign doctors are now subjected to tough language checks before treating patients			1
since the new law was passed 429 doctors have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the @entity6 because their @entity4 language skills are not up to scratch			1
until now only nurses , midwives and dentists from outside the @entity26 were subject to any language competency tests			1
all foreign nurses , midwives and dentists will be required to pass @entity4 competency tests before treating patients in the @entity6 after mps voted to extend legislation introduced last year for all foreign doctors but today @entity31 voted to extend the rules to cover those from member states			1
today health minister dr @entity36 said voting to include all healthcare professionals , as well as doctors , would offer ' better protection for patients '			2
debating the final stage of the legislation , he said : ' we all value the contribution that doctors , nurses and healthcare professionals from all over the world make to our @entity8 , but being able to speak and communicate to a good standard of @entity4 is essential to provide high quality and safe patient care			1
' these new laws will provide protection for patients and the public			0
' currently the @entity56 is only required to test the language skills of those nurses and midwives coming to work in the @entity6 from outside the @entity26			1
those moving from member states are permitted to begin work without taking a language test			2
the @entity56 said there are currently 26,474 nurses and midwives from the @entity26 on their register , while another 66,163 are from @entity69 countries			2
there are a total of 685,262 nurses and midwives on the register			0
under the new powers if an applicant can not provide evidence of their language competency , the @entity56 will be able to ask them to take an internationally recognised test			2
the @entity56 's new powers are expected to come into effect later this year			0
a change in the law , which was passed for doctors last year , came after @entity85 doctor @entity84 killed his patient @entity86 , when he confused two drugs and gave mr @entity86 an overdose until last year when the law changed , the @entity89 only had the powers to test the language skills of foreign doctors from outside the @entity26			1
since 1983 , the doctors ' regulatory body had been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from @entity26 countries			0
last year 's change in law for doctors was prompted by an ' alarming ' number of cases where patients complained about poor treatment from doctors with a poor grasp of the @entity4 language			1
in 2008 @entity85 doctor , dr @entity84 killed his patient @entity86 , when he confused two drugs			0
as a result dr @entity84 , who was working his first shift in the @entity6 providing out - of - hours cover , injected mr @entity86 with 10 times the recommended dose of diamorphine			0
an inquest later found he was unfamiliar with the drug and had poor @entity4			0
the @entity116 - born medic was struck off by the @entity89 but was able to continue working in his adopted country of @entity85 after the authorities there let him off with a nine - month suspended prison sentence and a small fine			0
in addition , an alarming 66 cases were investigated by senior @entity8 staff in 2011 after patients complained of inadequate treatment , citing language difficulties			0
in an attempt to tackle the problem , the government proposed changing the law in september 2013			0
the language tests were to be introduced for the first time , for doctors arriving from the @entity26			1
health minister , dr @entity36 added : ' as a practising @entity8 doctor , i know the importance of good communication skills to ensure the very best patient care			0
' and i have seen first hand when poor communication has let down patients			0
' as a minister , i am pleased to be using my front line healthcare experience to give our healthcare regulators these important new language testing powers , which will benefit and protect patients and the public			0
' the bodies that regulate nurses , midwives , dentists and pharmacists will be given the same powers as the @entity89			1
the @entity89 now has the power to investigate any complaints made about doctors ' poor language skills			2
and as part of their regular appraisals , and the new medical revalidation process for doctors , which they must pass to continue treating patients , the @entity89 now checks language skills of those medics from overseas .			2

all healthcare workers from the @entity26 will now have to undergo language test
last year @entity128 passed new law to make all foreign doctors take test
*previously* only those from outside the @entity26 had to prove competency
but in *interests* of patient safety , @entity89 can now investigate doctors ' @entity4
since law passed 429 doctors have been refused licence to treat patients
today mps have voted to extend the law to cover nurses and midwives
pharmacists , dentists and other healthcare workers will also take tests
marks first time those from @entity26 will have to take language competency tests
