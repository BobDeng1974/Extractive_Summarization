it is the elite gentleman ’s establishment whose members have included @entity3 , @entity4 and innumerable politicians and aristocrats			1
now the historic @entity7 is at the centre of an intrigue that has embroiled @entity11 leader @entity10 , scandal - hit @entity14 mp @entity13 and a peer accused of being a government spy			1
the @entity17 has learned that mr @entity13 , who resigned from the @entity18 last weekend for sending x-rated pictures of himself , met mr @entity10 for lunch at @entity21 ’s in early july – at a time when the @entity11 leader was trying to woo disaffected @entity14 mps to his party			1
mr @entity41 growled : ‘ @entity13 , you are very unwise to have lunch with @entity10 so close to a reshuffle			2
’ the nature of mr @entity13 ’s exchanges with mr @entity10 and mr @entity41 has remained private			1
but it was followed by a sudden – if short - lived – turnaround in mr @entity13 ’s political fortunes			0
just two weeks after they dined , mr @entity13 , a previously rebellious malcontent who was sacked from the @entity53 ’ office last year , received a surprise promotion to @entity56			1
a number of disaffected @entity14 mps suspected of ‘ flirting ’ with @entity11 have been subject to a no 10 charm offensive , including offers of career advancement designed to stop them from joining @entity63 and @entity64 in defecting			1
last night mr @entity10 declined to reveal the content of his discussion with mr @entity13			1
he said : ‘ i meet a lot of mps			0
’ so how did no 10 find out about the @entity69 ? @entity32 's @entity71 's club in @entity35 , central @entity36 , is now at the centre of the scandal involving @entity10 friends of mr @entity13 accused the moustachioed @entity14 peer @entity76 , who was also dining at @entity78 ’s that day , of ‘ grassing him up ’ to @entity80			1
lord @entity76 , 69 , a veteran @entity14 fixer and official historian of the @entity14 , is a long - term ally of mr @entity41			0
last night the peer admitted : ‘ it was indeed brought to my attention that mr @entity10 and mr @entity13 were having lunch together across the room			1
but i am an old - fashioned gentleman who does n’t carry a mobile phone , so it would have been impossible for me to have tipped off @entity80 within that timeframe			0
‘ i do know mr @entity41 , or rather @entity90 as i prefer to call him , but i did n’t tell him about the lunch			0
not guilty ! ’ @entity32 ’s was founded in 1762 by the future prime minister @entity92 and named after original head waiter @entity78			0
it was the model for ‘ @entity94 ’ in the @entity96 books , written by club member @entity97 , while other members have included economist @entity99 , anti-slavery campaigner @entity100 and actor @entity101			0
mr @entity13 , 56 , was handed his new ministerial responsibility on july 15 ; the day before he made the catastrophic decision to send a semi-naked self - portrait , while clad in @entity106 pyjamas , to an undercover male reporter posing as a blonde pr girl			2
when the story emerged on the first day of last month ’s @entity14 – the same day as mr @entity64 ’s defection – mr @entity13 resigned his ministerial post			2
last weekend he announced that he would also be quitting the @entity18 at the next election after it emerged that he had sent other naked ‘ selfies ’ to a woman with whom he had been having an affair			0
he wrote in @entity17 of ‘ battling demons ’			0
@entity11 will target mr @entity13 ’s @entity118 seat , in its @entity120 heartland , hoping that the scandalous nature of the mp ’s downfall will swell the party ’s support			2
mr @entity13 declined to comment last night .			0
