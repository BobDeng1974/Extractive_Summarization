until now it ’s been widely assumed that @entity11 would put up the majority of the libel payout to @entity14 , whose name was briefly visible on a card that the 51 - year - old presenter handed to @entity18 during his appearance on this morning			1
however , i ’m told @entity2 has agreed to split the £ 125,000 damages plus legal costs , meaning he will lose at least £ 62,500 from his £ 1million salary this year			1

he felt very grateful to @entity11 for the significant public support they showed him at the time when there were many calls for him to be sacked			1
‘ obviously £ 60,000 is a significant amount of money , even for someone making as much as him			1
' it shows how seriously he took the situation , but he has no plans to speak publicly about it			1
he wants to move on			2

i ’m told @entity66 , 25 ( whose father is comic @entity77 ) has been axed from comedy series @entity79			2
her comedy group @entity81 were dropped after a tasteless @entity83 - themed sketch had to be scrapped because it featured torture			2
my @entity71 source reveals : ‘ @entity66 ’s group did n’t cut the mustard with @entity71 bosses			2
the fact she ’s @entity69 and @entity77 ’s daughter could n’t save her			2
’ but @entity66 ( above ) was given another chance — the @entity71 offered her a role on new @entity95 sitcom @entity96 , which has been widely panned by the critics			2
@entity98 will remain host of @entity11 panel show @entity100 , despite sending flirtatious messages behind his wife ’s back for a second time			1
in 2010 he sent explicit tweets to a fan , resulting in his exit from @entity110 ’s @entity109			0
but the show ’s executive producer @entity111 insists : ‘ it ’s irrelevant			0
he ’s a comic host doing a fine job			0
’ adventurer : @entity116 is at the centre of a very showbiz bidding war between the @entity71 , @entity11 and @entity119 @entity120 became a worldwide star after drinking his own urine and eating ants to survive in the wild , but now he is at the centre of a very showbiz bidding war between the @entity71 , @entity11 and @entity119			1
the channels are battling to sign the @entity128 ’s chief scout after the former @entity130 soldier signed a deal with @entity132 allowing him to work with @entity128 terrestrial broadcasters for the first time			0
‘ this will turn him into one of the biggest tv stars in @entity140 , ’ an insider predicts			0
broadcasters want to launch a version of his new @entity144 format @entity146			0
my source reveals : ‘ he takes 20 pairs of ordinary people into the wild and sends them on brutal and dangerous journeys			0
they are fighting for a £ 500,000 prize so the stakes are high			1
’ @entity11 also want him to compete on i ’m a celebrity ... and @entity119 already have an agreement to make another series of @entity159			1
meanwhile , @entity160 is expected to begin filming for another new show called @entity162 across @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 next month			0
returning : @entity11 's decision to bring back @entity168 for a second series was down to ' people power ' @entity11 ’s decision to bring back @entity168 for a second series was down to ‘ people power ’ , according to sources on the hit drama that came to a dramatic conclusion on monday night			1
i ’m told writer @entity177 and @entity11 executives only ever envisioned it as a one - off whodunit , meaning planning for series two is at a very initial stage			1
most of the cast have no idea whether they will be asked back , although there is an assumption that the leads @entity189 and @entity191 have ‘ expressed interest ’ in returning			0
@entity192 , who plays @entity193 , tells me : ‘ i have no idea if i ’ll be asked back			0
