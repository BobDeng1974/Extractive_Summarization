by @entity0 it ’s rare to walk into a house and instantly yearn to live there			0
so it must have been a wrench for @entity5 and @entity6 to decide to sell their enchanting @entity8 home			1
the @entity11 , on sale for £ 1.3 million , is just outside @entity12 in @entity13 , fortunately several miles from the flood - hit parts of the county			1
from each upstairs window is a magnificent view across to green rolling hills			0
‘ we have lived in @entity13 for six years and in the @entity20 for a year , ’ says @entity5 , 43			1

@entity5 ’s daughter with singer @entity48 is 25 - year - old model @entity49			1
‘ the great thing about @entity13 is that i can drop @entity46 at school , whizz up to town by train for meetings and pick her up at the end of school , ’ says @entity5			1
‘ i love the buzz of @entity39 , but a quieter family life in the country is wonderful			0
’ in the 1990s , @entity5 and @entity6 were part of the @entity62 , the group of actors , musicians and models living in @entity39 who became known for their party lifestyles			1
but just as members such as @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 now have a settled way of life , so have @entity5 and @entity6			1
room for family : one of the six bedrooms in the @entity20 , which @entity5 and her family are selling to find something smaller @entity80 and behold : the kitchen boasts a blue @entity83 stove as well as a sizable pantry @entity85 : the @entity87 family snuggle up on the leopard - skin sofa on chilly evenings to watch television swimming in style : @entity5 refurbished the @entity20 , including the baroque - style master en - suite bathroom , which has a roll - top bath @entity95 : not satisfied with the family home , @entity5 also renovated a gypsy caravan with six bedrooms and four bathrooms , there is plenty of space in the @entity20 for a large family and guests , including @entity49			1
before moving in , @entity5 spent six months refurbishing from top to bottom			1
she says : ‘ everything needed replacing – electricity , plumbing , the avocado 1970s bathrooms			0
’ most of the walls are white , with clever touches of colour – in the high - ceilinged drawing room the window frames are a delicate lilac , and the windows hung with @entity5 ’s own - design lace curtains			1
the large kitchen has pastel woodwork and a pale blue @entity83 warms the whole room			0
‘ we had to have a pantry as @entity6 loves to cook , ’ says @entity5			1
beyond the kitchen is a cosy snug where the family watch telly together on chilly evenings			0
walking up the wide stairs , you are faced with a large , light landing with rows of bookcases on either side			0
‘ this is a great place to sit and read , ’ says @entity5			2
fashionable family : @entity5 with her daughters @entity46 and @entity49 at a 2010 fashion show her vintage style is evident upstairs			2
@entity46 ’s bathroom has a pale - blue cast - iron bath , and the sink is patterned with wild flowers			2
the master bedroom leads into probably the coolest ( not literally ) bathroom in the country			0
with silver - and - black - lace - patterned wallpaper , grey - black curtains and freestanding bath , it is stunningly opulent			0
an enormous dressing room is lined with cupboards for @entity5 ’s clothes			2
outside the back door is an enchanting walled courtyard with picnic table and chairs			0
the rest of the three - acre garden is mostly lawn and orchard , with a paddock			0
‘ @entity46 wants a pony , but we have n’t got round to it , ’ says @entity5			2
a little outhouse constitutes another spare room			0
this one boasts an en suite bathroom and would be ideal for a nanny			0
