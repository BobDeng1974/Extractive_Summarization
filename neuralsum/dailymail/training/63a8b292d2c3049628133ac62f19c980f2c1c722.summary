by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 23 november 2013 she arrived with a smile on her face , hoping to walk away with £ 300million plus expenses			2
hours later , @entity5 was £ 20million richer but her cheery grin had been replaced with a look of disgust			1
after an ‘ extraordinary ’ legal fight that has spanned more than six years , 65 hearings and cost millions of pounds – mrs @entity5 , 49 , has finally won her right to a slice of her estranged husband ’s fortune			1
warring : @entity15 , left , and his estranged wife @entity16 , right , pictured arriving at the @entity17 in @entity18 today			1
she has always maintained that her husband was hiding his assets yesterday a judge ruled that ‘ fixer for the super-rich ’ @entity24 , 51 , appeared to have hidden around £ 45million from the court			1
he gave the wife £ 20million , despite the fact that she told the court she needed enough money to buy a £ 25million mansion in @entity18 ’s exclusive @entity30			1
but the judge launched a scathing attack on the @entity33 , saying he felt ‘ nothing but sympathy ’ for their two children , and criticising the warring couple for failing to be ‘ child - focused ’			2
in his ruling , mr @entity39 said : ‘ it is undoubtedly the most difficult financial remedy case i have ever come across			2
‘ this case has been extraordinary even by the standards of the most bitter matrimonial breakdowns			2
extremely serious allegations have been bandied around like confetti			2
‘ some of these allegations can only be described as “ wild ”			2
the case has cost the wife millions in litigation fees			2
‘ in many respects this is about as bad an example of how to litigate as i have encountered			0
’ he finished by saying : ‘ finally , i feel nothing but sympathy for the two children of these parties			0
through no fault of their own , their parents ’ marriage broke down			0
‘ a marital breakdown is distressing enough for any child , but for the divorce to then be played out in the full glare of the media must have been absolutely appalling for them			0
‘ what has occurred has not been child - focused			0
i truly hope that the parents will reflect on this			0
i hope it does not happen to any other children			0
’ speaking outside the court , mrs @entity5 – who has been refusing to finalise the divorce until the finances are resolved – said : ‘ it is a disgrace			1
i stand by what i said			0
life of luxury : @entity5 , pictured on the runway in @entity86 with @entity15 and their daughter after their flight on @entity90			1
she told the trial they went on four exotic holidays a year i feel nothing but sympathy for the two children			0
this must have been absolutely appalling for them mr @entity39 ‘ many people will be watching this and think it ’s a fortune but all this order is is a piece of paper			1
not for my two daughters and not for mr @entity24			1
’ asked about his wife ’s reaction to the ruling , mr @entity24 said : ‘ disgraceful ? that was my wife ’s quote was it ? no comment			0
’ mrs @entity5 had demanded half her husband ’s assets , claiming that he was worth ‘ a few billion pounds at least ’ but had hidden away his cash in a series of secret investments			1
he was said to have created a business structure called ‘ @entity125 ’ to hide assets from his wife as their marriage hit the rocks			1
luxury lifestyle : @entity127 in @entity128 is just one of the properties belonging to @entity24 five star family fun : @entity15 and @entity16 with daughters @entity132 and @entity134 on holiday in the @entity136 in 2000 wedding day : @entity15 and @entity5 signing a marriage register in 1995 wronged : @entity5 has been forced to pursue her estranged husband through the courts for years , claiming that he tried to avoid reaching a divorce settlement moving on : @entity24 pictured his model and tv presenter girlfriend @entity143 after employing 13 sets of lawyers and four teams of accountants , she remains convinced that property tycoon mr @entity24 ’s claims of bankruptcy are ‘ lies ’			1
but handing down his ruling , mr @entity39 said : ’ doing as best as i can , i find that he still has £ 45million hidden from this court			1
‘ the wife is entitled to a lump sum of £ 20million			0
i can see no reasons why the husband should not pay the sum quickly – i therefore order him to pay within 28 days			1
’ he added : ‘ i have rejected all the more fanciful allegations made against him			0
‘ i can not see how he would have complied with an order for a lump sum of £ 300million let alone £ 400million			0
i hope that he will take the view that he is better off paying the lower sum of £ 20million so that he can concentrate on rebuilding his life			0
’ after beginning their relationship in 1989 and having two daughters , the @entity33 had bought a home in @entity18 , a mansion in @entity128 , luxurious residences around the globe and travelled by private jet			1
but after they separated in 2006 a bitter battle for cash began			1
mr @entity24 offered his wife a £ 300million settlement on 25 august 2009 – but the next year insisted that he had suffered a financial ‘ meltdown ’			0
the court heard a further claim that mr @entity24 had then suggested another offer of £ 27million , saying that ‘ only a greedy cow would refuse that ’			1
by @entity184 this is n't over : speaking outside court today @entity5 said she was furious and branded the judgment ' disgraceful ' they enjoyed a lifestyle known only by the world ’s wealthiest , globe - trotting by private jet between their vast homes			1
inhabiting a world few people can imagine , @entity15 and @entity5 mixed in a superleague of power players			1
but as details of their fantastic riches were aired in court during one of @entity205 ’s most acrimonious and colourful divorce battles , perhaps the most eyebrow - raising moment was the revelation of the largesse of mr @entity24 ’s friends after the marriage fell apart			1
in a statement to the court , retail tycoon sir @entity210 said he had loaned mr @entity24 £ 80,000 in 2008 ‘ as a favour ’ to help pay for a @entity216 flat for mrs @entity5			1
restaurateur @entity217 confirmed that he loaned mr @entity24 £ 50,000 as he had known him for many years and wanted to help him through his financial difficulties			0
mrs @entity5 , 49 , sensationally alleged that the two men , along with @entity221 impresario @entity220 and the late @entity223 oligarch @entity222 were involved in a conspiracy to hide her husband ’s assets			1
her bombshell claim to the @entity17 came as she pursued former property developer mr @entity24 for part of the billions of pounds she said he had hidden			1
but mr @entity24 , 51 , said he was left penniless after the collapse of a @entity231 deal that cost him his entire fortune virtually overnight			2
she even alleged her husband was a major shareholder with @entity220 ’s @entity236 show , and added : ‘ i am told i will never find out the truth because these people are wealthy and powerful			2
’ mr @entity24 , a former fixer to the super-rich , told the court his wife ’s claims were those of a ‘ fantasist ’ and rejected her accusation that his friends were ‘ sheltering ’ his money			2
he had met @entity220 fewer than five times and had ‘ never had any business with him ’ , and it was ‘ laughable ’ that he had a secret shareholding @entity236			0
mr @entity24 claimed he had ‘ probably bumped into sir @entity210 in the street once and seen him outside a nightclub once ’ in two years			0
he said he had had no income since 2006 and was living ‘ with the support of friends ’			0
sir @entity210 , mr @entity220 , mr @entity217 and mr @entity222 , who was found hanged at his @entity262 mansion earlier this year , all dismissed her allegations of a conspiracy			0
in his ruling yesterday , the judge said that he ‘ entirely and unreservedly ’ accepted the evidence given to the court by sir @entity210 and mr @entity217 about their loans to mr @entity24			2
before their split , the couple lived in unimaginable luxury			0
they owned six mansions in @entity30 , @entity205 ’s most exclusive postcode , and the family home was £ 21million @entity127 in @entity128 , described as ‘ @entity278 in miniature ’			0
they also had a £ 3.5million beach house in @entity282 , a yacht in @entity284 , employed a small army of servants and housekeepers , and dined in the finest restaurants			0
they drove fabulous cars , including two @entity291 worth £ 700,000 each			2
mr @entity24 had a £ 70,000 watch , and said jewellery he bought for his wife ’s 40th cost £ 150,000 .			0

@entity5 had demanded half her husband @entity15 *'s* assets , maintaining he was worth ' a few billion at least ' but had hidden away ' a vast fortune '
speaking outside court she described her *lengthy* legal battle as ' a desperate struggle for me and my daughters '
accusing her husband of making a ' *mockery* of the justice *system* ' she vowed ' this is not over '
