by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:43 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 20 june 2013 to any onlooker who saw her on her way to class yesterday , she would have seemed like just another smiling seven - year - old			0
but for @entity8 , the day marked the milestone end of a remarkable journey			2
almost two years ago , the little girl was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of cancer , and her parents were told she had just weeks to live			1
@entity8 , 7 , had pancreatoblastoma - a rare cancer of the pancreas			1
she has now been given the all - clear after receiving part of her mother , @entity19 's , liver during a life - saving transplant operation but she defied the odds to beat pancreatoblastoma - a condition which only affects one child every two years in the @entity25			1
doctors told her parents @entity19 , 35 , and @entity28 , 39 , there was nothing they could do after finding a tumour on @entity8 's pancreas near the main blood vessels of her bowel			1
further tests showed the cancer had spread to @entity8 's liver , where a cluster of nine small tumours were growing			1
after being told she was dying , her parents devoted their time to making the most of @entity8 's final months and the family even travelled to @entity43 courtesy of the @entity45 which helps terminally ill children			1
but the couple from @entity48 , in @entity49 , refused to give up on their daughter and kept pushing to find a cure for her			0
one of the doctors at their local hospital discussed her case with surgeons at @entity57 , 116 miles away , who said they may be able to perform transplant surgery to save her			2
@entity8 was diagnosed after becoming fatigued and developing a swollen stomach			2
her parents were told her cancer was terminal and had spread to her liver			1
but just three months after the operation , she has now returned to school as a result , her mother , a children 's care home manager , donated part of her own liver after tests showed her organs were a perfect match for @entity8			1
in april , @entity8 underwent a six - hour operation to have her entire liver removed and replaced with a portion of her mother ’s			1
now , just three months after her life - saving operation , she has returned to school , after being given the all - clear by her doctors			1
mrs @entity8 said : ‘ as soon as we knew i was the right blood type it was a no brainer , it 's just what any mother would do for their child			1
‘ when i found out i was the right blood group i just thought “ it 's up to me then ”			0
‘ i feel happy knowing that @entity8 has got a part of my liver and she feels happy as well			1
‘ it 's still very surreal to think about but it 's unbelievable , she 's a miracle			0
from the first diagnosis i ca n't believe how far we have come			0
‘ from being told she was dying to now see her jumping and laughing with her friends at school is wonderful			2
we 're really grateful and feel very lucky			0
’ @entity8 was first diagnosed with pancreatoblastoma in september 2011 after her parents noticed her energy levels waning			1
the family were given hope when doctors said that they might be able to cure her with a transplant - they removed her liver , spleen and most of her pancreas and gave her part of her mother 's liver mrs @entity8 said : ‘ she just was n't herself , there was nothing significant but she just seemed a bit sluggish			1
‘ her stomach swelled up and we took her to @entity123 where they told us it was definitely cancer but they were n't sure what kind			2
‘ we were transferred to @entity128 where they initially thought it was lymphoma but more tests showed it was pancreatoblastoma			0
‘ it had spread to the lymph nodes and the liver - from the outset her prognosis was n't hopeful			2
‘ the consultant sat us down and said there was nothing more they could do			0
‘ the treatment continued but they basically said “ go and enjoy life , make the most of it because she wo n't survive ”			0
‘ as a parent to be told your little girl is going to die and there 's nothing they can do is the most horrendous thing to hear			0
when it was believed that @entity8 was dying , her parents decided to make the most of every last minute so they took her to @entity43 in the @entity156 @entity157 is a rare cancer of the pancreas which usually occurs during childhood			1
children with the disease rarely show symptoms when it is in its early stages , most do not have any symptoms until it is quite advanced			0
at this point , symptoms include abdominal pain , jaundice and vomiting			0
the tumours tend to be between two and twenty centimetres in size			0
treatment usually involves an operation , if the tumour is operable , and then chemotherapy			0
‘ we tried to make the most of things , we went to @entity43 in @entity156 , visited family in @entity183 and made a few trips to @entity185 , which is a family favourite			0
‘ every time we were thinking “ this could be the last ”			0
‘ the strange thing was that @entity8 seemed to be getting better to us , she was still going swimming , yet we were being told she was terminal			1
’ @entity8 underwent six bouts of chemotherapy but on @entity195 2011 her family was told that , although the tumours had shrunk , they had n't disappeared			2
@entity8 was referred to @entity57 - one of two centres in the @entity25 that can perform liver and small bowel transplants - where a specialist team reviewed the scans and said they may be able to cure @entity8			1
surgeons performed the first step of a two - stage procedure in november last year , removing the primary tumour along with @entity8 's spleen and two - thirds of her pancreas			1
at the same time medics assessed the youngster 's liver and decided that it would be possible to deal with the tumours using a liver transplant - meaning an agonising wait for a donor			1
@entity8 was put on a waiting list but during a discussion with a donor co-ordinator mrs @entity8 found out it was possible to be considered for a live organ donation			0
@entity8 has since made a remarkable recovery and yesterday said she was ¿ chuffed ¿ to be back at school mrs @entity8 went under the knife at the @entity226 , five miles away from where @entity8 lay waiting for her donor liver			1
during the six - hour procedure , part of mrs @entity8 ’s liver was transported across @entity232 to be transplanted into @entity8			1
two teams of liver transplant consultants performed each operation - mr @entity235 and mr @entity236 on @entity8 , and @entity237 and @entity238 performed the operation on her mother			1
mr @entity235 said : ‘ it was a two - step procedure			0
first we removed the spleen , part of the pancreas and the main tumour			2
‘ while carrying out that operation it gave us chance to consider the tumours on her liver - the options were to leave it or actively go for it			2
‘ we thought we can not let the family live with this - so we decided to go for the second step and perform a transplant			2
’ @entity8 has since made a remarkable recovery and yesterday said she was ‘ chuffed ’ to be back at school			2
she said : ‘ i have missed all my friends and could n't wait to see them all again			0
‘ my favourite subject is maths and i 'm looking forward to going swimming again			0
i 'm chuffed it 's all over			0
’ the youngster will have to take medication for the rest of her life to ensure her body does not reject the donor liver , and her hearing was damaged by chemotherapy .			0
