with his menacing grin and a devilish look in his eye , does this shark remind you of anyone ? he 's a dead ringer for @entity7 , the great white from hit 2003 children 's film @entity12			1
as movie fans will know , @entity7 ( voiced by @entity13 ) is a friendly shark who tries – not always successfully – to resist the urge to eat other fish			1
it was one of 20 blacktip and tiger sharks that swarmed around photographer @entity19 off the coast of @entity28 in @entity20			1
they munched on floating bait , leaving mr @entity19 free to take this snap			1
mr @entity19 said : ' swimming with sharks is like stress relief for me			1
what could be better ? ' it is not very dangerous if you know what are you doing and how to do it correctly and safely			2
' @entity40 are not interested in humans			2
they need only a tasty fish to satisfy their hunger			2
' you just have to keep everything under control			0
do not wave your hands and try to keep the sharks in sight at all times			0
' sometimes they will even collide with you , bump into the camera , but nothing bad happens			0
' the photographer , who runs an adventure travel company , says taking pictures of sharks ' is not dangerous ' the 32 - year - old , who runs an adventure travel company and a group of divers placed bait into the water around their boat to entice the sharks			1
within a few minutes they were surrounded by blacktip and tiger sharks			0
in search of a free meal , the sharks quickly devoured the fish - completely ignoring the humans in their territory			0
describing the dive , he added : ' the main problem when shooting sharks in @entity20 is that there are too many ! everything is teeming with sharks			1
' they 're everywhere - swarming around your face , crashing into the camera , their sensitive noses poking into your legs			0
' therefore , to make a picture is extremely difficult			0
' at the beginning of the dive , there was around seven sharks			0
but by the end we counted 20 already around us			2
