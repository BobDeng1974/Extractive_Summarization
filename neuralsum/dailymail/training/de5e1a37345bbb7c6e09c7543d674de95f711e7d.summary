the @entity5 is targeting people hunting illegally , hare coursing , badger baiting and other wildlife crimes ( file photo ) the charity will use cameras mounted on remote - controlled aircraft to monitor land previously off - limits ( file photo ) chief executive @entity24 said : ' there is a war in the countryside and whilst there are still individuals determined to flout the law and seek new ways to avoid detection , the @entity5 will continue to explore safe , tested and innovative technology to further our charitable aim of ending cruelty to animals in the name of sport			1
' the charity said the use of drones would support its teams on the ground already gathering intelligence and evidence of illegal activity			2
it maintained that all its operations were ' proportionate , necessary and justified ' and were only carried out when there was a ' strong possibility of cruel criminality taking place '			0
mr @entity24 added : ' we are excited to be the first animal welfare charity in @entity56 to be exploring drone technology			0
' we are confident that it will make a fantastic contribution to bringing wildlife criminals to justice			0
' the charity is working with non-profit aerial surveillance and monitoring organisation @entity64 to use the drones			0
@entity67 , of the pro-hunting @entity68 , said the @entity5 was becoming ' increasingly desperate ' and was living in ' cloud cuckoo land '			1
' we think this is completely impractical and the @entity5 has spent the last three years talking about the investment in what it calls " surveillance " , ' he said			1
' they have nâ€™t had a single conviction under the @entity76 of a hunt as a result of their activities in the last three hunting seasons			0
' we think they are increasingly desperate			0
the idea that flying a drone over a hunt is suddenly going to lead to convictions [ ... ] they are living in cloud cuckoo land			1
' the fact is that the law is unworkable and in our view a ridiculous piece of legislation			0
' the chance of multiple prosecutions of hunts are very , very limited			0
' mr @entity67 said there were also civil liberty questions to answer on drones flying over private property filming			1
activists from the @entity5 staged a protest against proposed badger culls in october , and now the charity is to use drones to spy on wildlife crimes ' they are some really quite profound arguments going on about whether a non-governmental organisation should be able to carry out these sort of activities without proper scrutiny , ' he said			1
' if this was a serious attempt to bring hunts to court we would have expected to have heard about it in the courts and from lawyers - and not in the newspapers			2
' they are increasingly desperate and when you look at the effort organisations like the @entity5 put on using the legislation , we consistently beat them in the courts			1
' there have been a handful of hunts prosecuted in the last eight years			0
' there are nearly 300 hunts in the country and between 20,000 to 25,000 individual hunting days each season , and from that you are seeing a tiny number of prosecutions - most of which fail			2
