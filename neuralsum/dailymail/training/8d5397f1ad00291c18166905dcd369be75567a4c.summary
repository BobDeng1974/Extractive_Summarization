@entity0 was born just six months after @entity2 's last appearance at a @entity4 finals , but they might not have to wait another decade and a half before they 're back on the biggest stage if @entity11 's latest teenage sensation fulfills the hype			1
@entity14 's midfield magician has been linked with @entity11 's finest at the tender age of 15 , and is already the @entity2 @entity16 's most talked - about player			1
video : scroll down to see 15 - year - old wonderkid @entity0 in action wonderkid : @entity0 in action for @entity14 , but will we see him in the @entity22 before long ? hot property : the 15 - year - old already has three goals for the @entity2 side he 's a @entity27 fan - you can probably thank @entity29 for that - but @entity31 could be ready to table a £ 12million plus bid for the attacking midfielder , who is already firmly bedded into @entity36 's side , scoring three times in 12 league and cup appearances with half the season gone			1
fellow @entity42 giants @entity43 and @entity44 have already seen @entity0 in action first - hand , welcoming the wonderkid to train with them last winter			1
he also trained with @entity49 side @entity48 , and supposedly ' visited ' @entity50 last year			2
he signed a professional contract with @entity14 in may to keep him at the club for 2014 and 2015 , but the two - time @entity2 champions will be bracing themselves for a bombardment of interest , and could receive a fee to strengthen their finances for years to come			1
still a kid : @entity0 signed a professional contract with @entity14 earlier this year even at this age , @entity0 lacks very little			1
he has balance , agility , confidence and a ferocious shot			0
to add , the @entity66 - born star has shown the strength to suggest he can mix it with the big boys in the big leagues , not shying away from duels with defenders twice his size			0
@entity0 has attracted some firm attention on these isles , but from north of the border from @entity76			2
earlier in july , @entity78 manager @entity77 rejected claims the @entity81 champions could not afford to sign the young starlet			0
' it ’s incorrect to say that @entity0 is outwith our range , ' @entity77 told @entity2 tv			2
' @entity0 must do what is best for him and we will do what is best for us - we ’ll see if our paths meet at a later date			2
' @entity0 is a good player but not even close to being a @entity76 player at the moment			0
but there ’s no doubt that he has the capability to be in the future			0
' invest in youth : @entity2 press have suggested @entity99 's @entity31 are eyeing up at the youngster get them young : @entity0 trained at @entity44 last year , along with @entity43 , but new @entity103 boss @entity102 has other transfer targets on his mind it is not uncommon for clubs to battle it out with several other giants for the signature of a young star , and this is no different			1
in fact , @entity0 's father , former professional @entity112 , told @entity2 newspaper @entity114 there have been over 30 clubs asking about his son			2
' i ca n't name the clubs , but almost regardless of who you name , they have been in contact with us , ' @entity0 senior told @entity114			0
@entity114 reported that clubs such as @entity126 , @entity44 , @entity50 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 have visited @entity14 's @entity131 home ground to see @entity0 in action			1
in the heart : @entity0 is a @entity27 fan , and is thought to have had over 30 clubs contact him compatriot : former left - back @entity29 , a @entity27 fan favourite , hailed from @entity2 ' we want @entity0 to develop , ' said his 40 - year - old father , adding that it would be impossible to visit all the clubs that have been in contact			1
' that ( development ) has been the focus over the years			0
if you start to think about other things , i think the development comes to a halt , ' @entity0 said			0
this is n't a matter of if @entity0 will leave @entity2 , more a matter of when			0
with just weeks until the new season in the @entity153 , @entity49 and @entity154 - and with the @entity2 league still in progress - scouts will have to act quick to capture the youngster .			0
