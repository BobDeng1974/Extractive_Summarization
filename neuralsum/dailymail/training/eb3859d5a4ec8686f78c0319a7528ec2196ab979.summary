strains of highly antibiotic - resistant bacteria have been found in river water downstream of a sewage treatment plant , scientists have warned			1
the contamination of the @entity6 , near @entity7 , has sparked concern over the growing threat caused by superbugs that are resistant to ‘ last resort ’ antibiotics			1
the drug - resistant bugs were detected in samples taken by specialists from @entity16 near the @entity18 sewage treatment works			1
the resistant bacteria , which is carried in faecal matter , were strains of @entity20 that produce extended - spectrum beta - lactamases ( @entity22 ) - enzymes that can destroy many antibiotics including all penicillins			1
these microscopic images show a strain of antibiotic resistant bacteria found in the @entity6 near @entity7 @entity22 infections are particularly dangerous because treatment options are limited and drugs need to be given by injection in serious cases			1
study leader professor @entity34 , a lecturer in @entity35 at @entity16 , along with colleagues from @entity38 universities and the @entity39 ( now @entity40 ) , analysed sediment samples from upstream and downstream			2
they found bacteria resistant to important antibiotics used to treat a range of problems , including meningitis , septicaemia , and so - called hospital - acquired infections			1
they also found resistant @entity20 were seven times more common downstream of a @entity53 sewage plant than upstream			2
their findings suggest resistance is spreading because of a gene called @entity58 which bacteria collect to adapt to their environment			2
the researchers say stricter regulations and higher levels of treatment are needed to halt the rise in antibiotic resistance in the environment			2
prof @entity68 said : ‘ if you disturb the sediment and then consume just 5ml of the water then you run the risk of getting gastroenteritis , which can make you extremely ill. ‘ it would be like getting @entity76 up your nose and could be untreatable			0
‘ if the resistant bacteria colonised in your gut and through , say a urinary infection , was able to leave the body , then the bacteria would be out in the open , no longer just in the river sediment ’ she added			1
the findings were published in the @entity87 this month after the tests took place between 2009 and 2011			0
professor @entity90 , head of @entity40 ’s @entity91 and @entity92 , said the extent of the health risk caused by @entity22 - positive bacteria was unclear			2
professor @entity34 , a lecturer in @entity35 at the @entity16 said the bacteria could pose a threat he said the agency was undertaking a three - year study to establish the variety of different strains in circulation			1
this is not the first time that antibiotic - resistant bacteria have been found in river water , he added			1
he said : ‘ this finding causes concern although we have to keep it in perspective			0
‘ just having had skin contact with the river water is not sufficient to cause illness			0
‘ for it to become a problem would require a particular chain of events to occur and the likelihood of these all happening needs to be borne in mind			0
‘ our advice is that if anyone does become ill after swimming in rivers or streams then they should always advise their gp of their recent activities			0
’ a spokesman for @entity130 , which runs the sewage plant at @entity18 , said : ' @entity130 takes its environmental responsibilities extremely seriously			0
' earlier this month we received confirmation from our environmental regulator , @entity135 , that we have achieved a four star rating and leading company status for our environmental performance ( we were the only company in the @entity53 water industry to reach this standard )			0
‘ the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria is without question an internationally important issue , and we are already engaged in increasing our knowledge to determine whether waste water treatment has role to play in this area			1
‘ in conjunction with all the other @entity53 water and sewerage companies , we are actively involved in a multi-million pound national research project to look at the levels of pharmaceuticals in the sewage entering our treatment works			0
’ antibiotic resistance is a growing worldwide problem , where common bacteria that cause infections are becoming resistant to drugs used to treat them			2
@entity165 resistance is a broader term , suggesting resistance to drugs to treat infections caused by other microbes as well , such as parasites , viruses and fungi			0
many hospital - acquired infections including pneumonia and bloodstream infections are caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin - resistant @entity177 ( @entity76 ) or multidrug - resistant gram - negative bacteria			1
patients with infections caused by drug - resistant bacteria are generally at increased risk of worse health and death - people with @entity76 are estimated to be 64 per cent more likely to die than people with a non-resistant form of the infection			1
many hospital - acquired infections caused by highly resistant bacteria as standard treatments become ineffective , infections persist which increases the risk of spread to others			1
resistance to the treatment of last resort for life - threatening infections caused by common intestinal bacteria – carbapenem antibiotics – has spread globally and many countries lack basic systems to track and monitor the problem			2
the evolution of resistant strains is a natural phenomenon that occurs when microorganisms replicate themselves erroneously or when resistant traits are exchanged between them			2
but experts say the use and misuse of antimicrobial drugs accelerates the emergence of drug - resistant strains			1
this includes over-prescribing of such drugs – for example to treat viruses that do not respond to antibiotics – and easy over-the - counter availability in some other countries			0
poor infection control practices , inadequate sanitary conditions and inappropriate food - handling encourages further spread			0
the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in cattle has also come under scrutiny			0
a 2014 report from the @entity234 says antibiotic resistance is no longer a prediction for the future ; it is happening right now , across the world , and is putting at risk the ability to treat common infections in the community and hospitals			0
‘ without urgent , coordinated action , the world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era , in which common infections and minor injuries , which have been treatable for decades , can once again kill ’ , it says .			0
