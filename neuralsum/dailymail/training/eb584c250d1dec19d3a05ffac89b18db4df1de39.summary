by @entity0 published : 08:34 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 18:05 est , 30 november 2012 a former @entity2 policeman has come to the rescue of sweet - toothed vegetarians who want to enjoy treats made without animal extracts			1
@entity7 , 56 , has opened the @entity9 's first entirely vegetarian sweet shop with products made using plant extracts instead of gelatine			1
his store , called @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , is modelled on a traditional sweet shop with the animal - free treats displayed in giant jars and served by weight			1
serving up animal - free treats : @entity7 runs the @entity9 's first - ever entirely vegetarian sweet shop in @entity16 @entity7 said he decided to open the store because he was fed up of missing out on eating sweets after becoming a vegetarian at the age of 12 when growing up on a farm			1
he said : ' i gave up meat because i loved the animals too much			0
when i told my mum she told me i was going through a funny phase			0
' it is very difficult when you are a vegetarian to find products that you know are 100 per cent meat - free			2
most people do n't know when they buy some red coloured sweets they are coloured with cochineal - in other words they are eating crushed beetles			1
sweet expectations : the store is modelled on a traditional sweet shop but only has products made using plant extracts not gelatine ' now we only sell sweets which contain beetroot			1
there are so many vegetarians across the @entity9 now and i think my shop has filed a gap in the market			0
' many sweets contain gelatin which is derived from collagen from animal by - products			2
confectioners traditionally extract the chemical from animals then use it to make most chewy and boiled sweets and marshmallows			0
@entity7 uses carnauba wax from @entity70 palm leaves and agar agar from red marine algae to make his vegetarian versions			2
business is booming : @entity7 said there is a gap in the market for his sweets and his success has meant he can take on staff like assistant @entity81 , pictured his shop is the only entirely veggie sweet shop in the @entity9 according to the @entity84			2
the father - of - two said business has been booming since he opened his store and the lifestyle is a complete change of pace to his old police job			0
he served 30 years with the @entity2 - including five years in @entity93 's @entity92 - before investing his pension in his dream to create a sweet heaven for vegetarians			1
change of pace : the former policeman , pictured in uniform on the day of his wedding to wife @entity102 , served with the @entity2 for 30 years he said : ' working for the police is all encompassing and it can be hard when you retire			1
now i have a new challenge to focus on			0
' he added that his wife , @entity102 , 56 , ' was n't that keen ' on the idea at first as she thought it would mean he would be working on saturdays			0
but the business has been such a success @entity7 can afford staff to cover the weekend shifts for him .			0

most common sweets use gelatin - made from animal bones and *hooves* or cochineal - a red colouring made from crushed beetles
@entity7 , who served 30 years in the force , says he was fed up of missing out on sweets after becoming vegetarian aged 12
@entity7 's sweets use plant extracts and beetroot as *substitutes*
