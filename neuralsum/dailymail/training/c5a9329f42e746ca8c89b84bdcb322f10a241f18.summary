the @entity0 is now building a facility that will make it more than seven times the size of the @entity4 , making the secretive compounds the biggest in the country			2
in addition to building a $ 1.9billion data center in @entity10 , crews also started construction on a computing center that is expected to cost $ 792million near @entity13			1
together , the two facilities total 228 acres , much of which is dedicated to the collection of emails and phone calls that it was recently revealed the @entity0 stores without an individual knowledge			2
information overload : a report in july showed the @entity0 is doing a lot more than spying on @entity24 with terrorist connections , perhaps with the help of its $ 1.7 billion @entity27 more convenient : as opposed to the remote @entity30 facility , there is also a 28 - acre facility owned by the @entity0 that in outside of @entity13 , @entity33 outnumbered : the two @entity0 sites are now more than seven times the size of the @entity4 much attention has been paid to the secretive practices of the @entity0 since consultant @entity38 leaked classified documents proving that the intelligence agency had free reign to the electronic footprint of people , both in and out of the country , who used certain phone carriers			1
@entity0 official @entity47 told @entity48 that the @entity10 facility is ' only brick and mortar ' but they need the space because ' it 's required to be big ' as a result of their growing surveillance			1
' i think we 're crossing into content , ' he told the site			0
@entity60 , a former cover field operations officer for the @entity61 , told @entity62 that the paranoia surrounding the billion dollar project was understandable yet exaggerated , adding that the main problem was the size of the data collection warehouse			2
more : the @entity27 , near @entity68 , was rumored to be one of the sites where personal data extracted by the @entity0 was stored storage : an aerial photograph shows the center ' the fact that they ’re building a new data center is n’t news , ' @entity60 told @entity62			1
' they ’ve got several other [ similar ] facilities			0
the size of this is what is creating the stir			0
' once built , the million square foot centre will be more than five times the size of the @entity24 @entity87 , and will use an estimated $ 40m of electricity every year , according to one estimate			0
@entity0 public information officer @entity90 added : ' many allegations have been made about the planned activities of the @entity27 ' what it will be is a state - of - the - art facility designed to support the @entity97 ’s efforts to further strengthen and protect the nation			2
@entity0 is the executive agent for the @entity100 , and will be the lead agency at the center			0
' mystery : a close - up section of @entity0 's @entity27 is shown in @entity68 in july powerhouse : these images were released last year as it emerged the government is secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of @entity111 customers , as well as data from companies including @entity114 and @entity115 the @entity27 which is being constructed on @entity116 on the @entity30 - @entity118 line will be completed in october - but officials have been tight - lipped about what will be stored there			1

the plans note they must all be @entity24 citizens			0
in light of the nature of the site they are building , many will have to have a higher degree of security clearance than an average construction worker			0

stash : the government has been tight - lipped about what will be stored in the center 's four ' data halls ' plans : sketches released by @entity151 engineers show the massive center , which is believed to cost $ 1.7 billion ' we 're mining data , we 're gathering data and it 's all done secretly , ' @entity137 of @entity10 director @entity153 told @entity158			1
' we do n't even know what 's going on			0
' ' when the @entity0 facility in @entity10 was announced , local officials praised it for the jobs it would bring , ' @entity161 director @entity160 added			1
