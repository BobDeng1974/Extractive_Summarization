a @entity1 hedge fund company is about to cash - in this week on a surprisingly secure investment - madonna			1
the organisation bought more than 140 @entity5 items , mostly costumes and jewellery she wore during her movie and singing career			1
the goods included dozens of outfits from the 1996 hit musical evita as well as the star 's peach baseball dress and glove from her 1992 movie ' @entity18 ' and a vest top and jeans she wore for her music video of @entity21			1
the glittery gold cowboy hat from her 2000 video for ' music ' also made up the collection , as did a tuxedo jacket she wore in the 1985 comedy film @entity51			0
@entity5 starring in the film @entity27 wearing the iconic ivory ball gown which is now set to fetch $ 4,000 - 6,000 ( £ 2,499 - £ 3,755 ) it is not known exactly how much money the group paid for the collection but it is estimated it could sell at auction for up to £ 400,000 this friday , which would at least double their investment			1
one of the reasons why the outfits have shot up in value over the last decade is because @entity65 has shown them off around the world in their ' simply madonna - materials of the girl ' exhibition			1
the display has helped raise the profile and interest in the items			0
@entity65 was launched in 2005 looking for investors to raise a six - figure kitty to snap up celebrity memorabilia			1
the group targeted @entity5 material because the collectors ' market for merchandise relating to the @entity85 , @entity80 and @entity81 was already well - established			2
the deep pink satin gown worn by @entity5 in the 1984 music video @entity43 is estimated to sell for $ 60,000 ( £ 37,541 ) while the white fox fur stole worn with it is estimated to go for $ 6,000 ( £ 3,755 ) the group targeted @entity5 material because the collectors ' market for merchandise for the singer was less established than other stars - and it has proved to be a wise investment @entity94 , 42 , the chief executive of @entity65 , said : ' we set up @entity65 in 2005 because nobody in the market had set up a fund to invest in entertainment collectibles unlike art funds and vintage car funds			1
' we built up a network of investors who had to earn over £ 100,000 a year or who had £ 250,000 worth of assets not including a house			0
' we then had to decide who were were going to invest in			0
@entity81 and the @entity85 are a bit played out so we decided on @entity5 as she transcends two generations and her stuff if quite rare on the open market			2
even just these song lyrics written by @entity5 for an unknown song and scribbled on a piece of note paper is expected to reach $ 800 - 1,200 ( £ 500 - £ 750 ) as die hard fans clamor to own any piece of the songstress other items up for grabs are the @entity122 uniform worn by @entity5 , in @entity18 in 1992 ( @entity28 , $ 3,000 - 5,000 or £ 1,877 - £ 3,128 ) and , right , the @entity123 for @entity124 ( @entity28 , $ 4,000 - 6,000 or £ 2,502 - £ 3,753 ) ' in @entity27 , @entity5 set a record for the number of costume changes , which was 88			1
' we went to the costume house that supplied the dresses and bought 35 of them			0
we were cash rich and made them an offer they could n't refuse			0
' the fund sourced and bought dozens of other outfits , shoes and items of jewellery used by @entity5 during her career spanning 20 years			1
mr @entity94 said : ' it was a 10 year investment but we did n't just want the collection to sit there and hope it would increase in value which is why she showed it off around the world			2
' we have three years left to run but we feel that now is a prime opportunity to offload it as the market has picked up			0
' the pink @entity43 gown is likely to sell at auction for about £ 37,000 while a blue taffeta dress @entity5 wore while performing ' @entity156 ' on stage during her 1987 tour is tipped to sell for £ 40,000			2
@entity159 , of @entity161 - based @entity160 , said : ' @entity5 is one of the most collectible living celebrities			2
' we hope to break $ 100,000 with the pink dress that she wore in the video ' @entity43 '			0
' @entity65 was very smart in investing in @entity5 and we are going to show them a sound return for their investment			1
@entity5 is not only a global pop icons but a blue chip when it comes to investing			0
