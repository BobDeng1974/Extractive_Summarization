a father has been left unable to recognise the faces of his wife or two children after suffering a stroke			1
after the devastating episode @entity6 , from @entity7 , south east @entity8 , even looked at a picture of a couple holding a baby and did n't recognise it was him , his wife and their daughter			1
the 58 - year - old discovered he had suffered a minor stroke after he woke in the night thinking that he had gone blind			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , south east @entity8 , has been left unable to recognise the faces of his wife or two children after suffering a stroke mr @entity6 was diagnosed with a severe case of prosopagnosia - otherwise known as face blindness - which is a surprisingly common condition , but usually inherited doctors said the attack had been triggered by a blood clot on the brain and he was discharged once the swelling on his brain had gone down			1
he had thought that a slight loss of vision in part of his eye was the only lasting legacy of his stroke			2
but he soon realised his problem was far more serious when he went to school to pick up his six - year - old son @entity36 and could n't pick him out among the rest of the children			1
and when he looked through family photo albums he found he could n't recognise his own children when they were younger - or even a picture of himself			1
when he looked through photo albums of family holidays ( pictured ) he found he could n't recognise his own children when they were younger - or even a picture of himself mr @entity6 said now his children are grown up he ca n't really remember what they looked like when they were younger he also had difficulty identifying @entity47 his wife of 22 years if her hair was tied back in other photos			1
mr @entity6 was diagnosed with a severe case of prosopagnosia - otherwise known as face blindness - which is a surprisingly common condition , but usually inherited			1
since then he has struggled to recognise friends and workmates but copes by memorising people 's distinctive features , such as posture , mannerisms and speech			1
he has decided to speak out about it now to raise awareness of the condition			0
mr @entity6 , a director at the @entity64 - an initiative funded by the @entity67 's national innovation agency - said : ' when i used to pick my son up from school all the kids were in their uniform so i was unable to recognise him			1
@entity73 can result from stroke , traumatic brain injury , or some neurodegenerative diseases			2
mr @entity6 , who married @entity47 in 1993 , is father to @entity36 , 13 , and daughter @entity77 , 17 , and says they have all come to terms with his bizarre condition since his stroke in 2008 @entity73 is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people 's faces			1
also known as ' face - blindness ' , the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers			1
some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face , while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces , and in more severe cases sufferers can not distinguish a face as being different from an object			2
some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces			2
the condition is not related to memory loss , impaired vision or learning disabilities			0
it is thought to be the result of abnormalities , damage , or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory			2
@entity73 can result from stroke , traumatic brain injury , or some neurodegenerative diseases			2
in some cases the condition is congenital , and present at birth			0
it appears to run in families , which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion			0
some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and @entity134			0
treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies , including relying on voice recognition , clothing , or unique physical attributes			0
source : @entity143 ' there was a similar occasion at @entity147 station with my daughter - she did n't tell me what she was wearing so i had n't a clue who she was			2
' i thought i only had a mild version of the condition but after i did some tests the doctors told me i had a severe impairment			0
' it is very difficult to imagine really			0
people find it impossible to believe that i ca n't recognise their face			1
' it is difficult for people i know to comprehend that my brain ca n't work out what they look like			0
' he added : ' it is only the faces that i ca n't recognise , so i can identify people by their hair or clothing or their mannerisms and posture			1
' if there are people who look similar in the same place then i would really struggle			0
i wait for people to approach me			0
' when i am in the supermarket my wife will whisper in my ear and say " that 's @entity178 our neighbour " or something like that			0
' if a picture of my wife was in front of me and her hair was tied back i would n't be able to say who it was			0
' there was one time when i was looking at a couple holding a baby and i recognised the baby 's outfit but i did n't realise it was me and my wife holding it			0
' now the kids are grown up i ca n't really remember what they looked like when they were children			2

@entity200 , a director at @entity67 which @entity6 is a member of , said : ' you ca n't cure face blindness but there are lots of strategies to help cope with it if we can raise some awareness			1
' people certainly become more isolated because it is just too awkward and embarrassing to put themselves in certain social situations			0
