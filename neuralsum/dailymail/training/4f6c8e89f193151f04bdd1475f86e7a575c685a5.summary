@entity0 was driving to visit his girlfriend when he was struck by the beauty of the rolling vineyards			0
many people would have carried on without bothering to stop and take a photograph			0
but the former @entity7 photographer was so entranced by the green of the grass and the white clouds in the perfectly blue @entity12 sky that he pulled over and got out his camera			0
never for a moment did he think the shot would become the most viewed image on the planet			2
scene grab : the area shot by @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity12 , for his ' @entity24 ' photo used by @entity25 familiar view : the @entity25 default background image recognisable to @entity29 users when it comes to famous photographs , a computer desktop image is unlikely to be the first thought on most people ’s minds			1
but more than a billion people around the world have seen mr @entity0 ’s photo of the countryside near his @entity41 home			2
most of them do n’t even realise they have been looking at it			2
for it was chosen by @entity47 engineers as the desktop image for their @entity25 background			1
although the 69 - year - old photographer signed a confidentiality agreement so he ca n’t say how much he got paid – it is reportedly the second most expensive photo licence ever purchased			1
‘ i drove the same route between @entity22 and @entity55 a couple of times a week in 2002 or 2003 but this was january when the grass is the most brilliant green here so i jumped out and took a couple of shots and then carried on my way , ’ said mr @entity0			0
mr @entity20 's shot purchased for an undisclosed sun by @entity47 he did n’t give much more thought to the picture after picking up girlfriend @entity67 , who he married shortly after			1
it was only when he got a call from his agent with the @entity72 photo archive telling him that @entity47 wanted the original of the picture that he discovered he ’d hit the jackpot			1
‘ i had no idea when i took the photograph that anything like that could happen			0
it is probably the most recognized photo on the planet			2
if you took it to some village in @entity86 the might recognise it or you could stop somebody walking down the street in @entity89 and they may know what it is , ’ he added			0
mr @entity0 , who began his career with the @entity94 and the @entity95 , worked for 25 years for the @entity7 and now specialises in photographing winemaking in @entity22 and around the world			0
but unlike many pc users , he does n’t get to see his @entity25 photo every day – because he uses a @entity100 the @entity25 screensaver fits seemlessly over the scenery as it looks today			1

@entity20 's photo was used by @entity47 for it 's xp background
he ca n’t say how much he got paid for the rights to the image
it is reportedly the second most expensive photo licence ever purchased
