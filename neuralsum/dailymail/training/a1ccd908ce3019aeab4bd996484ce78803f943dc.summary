by @entity0 published : 12:20 est , 9 june 2012 updated : 14:12 est , 9 june 2012 fat - busting : scientists believe a drug could be developed to tackle obesity by targeting hunger pangs in the brain a super diet pill aimed at curbing fat people 's appetites could soon be a reality thanks to boffins who have found the secret to tackling obesity may lie in the brain			1
the pill would not only shrink waist lines but also the Â£ 4.2 billion @entity18 bill for treating obesity related illness such as cancer , diabetes and heart disease			2
scientists in the @entity25 believe the hypothalmus area of the brain - a receptor controlling body temperature , hunger , thirst and fatigue - is particularly sensitive to drugs which could hold the key to fighting flab			1
professor @entity36 , from @entity37 , said : ' we 've identified a receptor that is immediately involved in regulating food intake			2
' what is especially encouraging is that it is a highly ' druggable ' target			0
in fact , several existing medications already seem to interact with this receptor			2
' the researchers , whose findings are published in the @entity49 journal , studied insulin and leptin hormones , which inhabit the @entity53 molecule and are vital to maintaining the body 's energy balance			0
they did so by creating a strain of mice to explore the effects of appetite stimulation and discovered a gene called @entity61			0
the scientists found that when the gene was injected into normal rodents , it resulted in an increase in appetite and a decrease when it was blocked - without negative side effects			1
they said the gene is also found in humans and would be a good target for fat busting drugs , which could be available in only a few months by modifying existing medicines to target the brain			1
nearly a quarter of adults in the @entity78 are classed as obese , with the figure predicted to rise to 40 per cent by 2022			0
@entity81 , from the @entity80 , told the @entity82 : ' of all the measures that over time will quell obesity this has got to be one of the most promising avenues			0

scientists in the @entity25 have found the secret to fighting the flab may lie in the brain
a *gut* - shrinking drug that targets the receptor controlling hunger could be available within months
