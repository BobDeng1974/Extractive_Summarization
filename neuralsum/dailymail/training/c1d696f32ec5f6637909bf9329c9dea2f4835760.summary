by @entity0 a biker has been filmed performing a series of death - defying tricks inside a hollowed - out mansion on ' @entity6 ' in @entity7			2
@entity8 rode his dirt bike into the former @entity11 embassy on @entity7 - reputed to be the most expensive street in @entity13 - which is now owned by the founder of @entity16 estate agent			1
once inside the @entity18 - listed building , which is currently undergoing a total renovation , he carried out stunts such as doughnuts , wheelies and jumps before going up to the roof			1
scroll down to watch the amazing video imposing : mansion is thought to be worth around £ 100 million despite needing total renovation stunt : rider used his @entity30 trials bike to perform doughnuts , wheelies and other tricks throughout the building beams : stunts included balancing over wooden beams where the floorboards had been removed he sped towards the edge of the roof at high speed , repeatedly braking just in time to stop inches short of a 50ft drop			1
the 27 year - old , who works for a biking magazine , also jumped onto the window ledges , hopping from one to another in a fearless display			0
but perhaps the most daunting move of all was abseiling through a skylight while still on his @entity55 48v trials bike , worth around £ 1,800			1
basement : at one point in the video the rider is seen zipping through arches underneath the house balance : later @entity62 appears on the roof of the mansion and balances on the apex with his leg ajar on the edge : he also bounces across the tops of small bay windows ' it was a really good experience , ' said mr @entity8 , from @entity74 in @entity75			1
' all that was going through my head when i got up there was do n't fall off , as i could be really badly hurt or die			0
' but once i started it was like riding on a pavement			0
i 've done a few stunts before but the abseiling bit was was terrifying			0
' it was all quite surreal as we were on the roof and people were down on the ground looking up			0
' the bike was brilliant			0
they market them as children 's bikes but it 's really strong and i 've had loads of fun with it			0
' jump : the daredevil could be seen jumping between windows from the ground without any ropes or safety net long way down : @entity8 considers a shortcut down from the roof through a skylight swing : he uses a lanyard to swing through safely into the room below the house used to be the @entity11 embassy , but in 2005 it was bought by entrepreneur @entity110 for £ 14million			1
mr @entity110 , who founded @entity16 in 1981 and sold it for £ 390million in 2001 , gave mr @entity8 permission to film his stunts in the house last summer			1
he is currently carrying out a major programme of renovation on the property , which is now estimated to be worth around £ 100million			2
among the features of the home when it is finally finished are set to be an underground tennis court , health centre and a private motor museum for mr @entity110 's six vintage ferraris			2
steady : @entity8 used careful control of his brakes to ensure he did n't slip over the edge relief : he removes his helmet at the end of the video the owner is known as a lover of motorsports - he hosts classic car exhibitions and motorcycle stunt shows at @entity136 , his country estate in @entity137			1
mr @entity8 's video , entitled ' @entity139 ' , has been viewed more than 320,000 times since it was first posted on @entity141			2
' when the video got to 20,000 views we went out and celebrated as we did n't expect it - but it has kept going , ' he said .			0
