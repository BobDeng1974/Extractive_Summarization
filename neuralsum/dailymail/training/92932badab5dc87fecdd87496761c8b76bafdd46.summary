by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 12:08 est , 9 july 2013 scientists have revealed the key to predicting climate change - and it lies in the excrement produced by earthworms			1
researchers from the @entity7 and the @entity8 discovered that earthworm faeces - also known as casting - contain tiny granules of calcite			2
after keeping different earthworms at different temperatures , they were able to prove that these granules retain a ' memory ' of the temperature of the air in which they are excreted			1
this means that by studying fossilised samples of earthworm poo and testing the residual temperature of the granules inside , scientists can now track changes in the @entity27 's climate over thousands of years			1
researchers from @entity30 and @entity8 universities have discovered the tiny granules of calcite found in the faeces of earthworms , pictured , retain the outside temperature at the time it 's excreted			1
by studying fossilised samples of this casting , scientists can track how the @entity27 's climate has changed over the years the small lumps of chalk - like material and their change in temperature can then be used to predict future climate trends			1
in the study , published in the journal @entity47 , researchers said the lumps appear to be uniquely marked by whatever temperatures they encountered in the surrounding environment at the time the worm excreted them			2
the researchers proved this by keeping the earthworms at different temperatures			2
isotopic testing - a test which monitors the movement and in turn the temperature of molecules - was then carried out on the calcite granules in each earthworm 's casting to discover that the different granules retained the temperature at which they were formed			1
tiny granules of calcite , similar to the one pictured , are found in earthworm casting			2
it retains the temperature of the air around it and can be used to track changes in the @entity27 's climate principal investigator prof @entity76 , of the @entity7 ’s environment department , said : ' there are many conflicting theories about why earthworms produce calcite granules , but until now , the small lumps of chalk - like material found in earthworm poo have been seen as little more than a biological curiosity			1
' however , our research shows they may well have an important role to play , offering a window into past climates			0
' lead author dr @entity92 , from the department of geography and environmental science at the @entity8 , added : ' this knowledge about past climates is of vital importance for developing and benchmarking climate models that make predictions for the future			0
' these chalk balls will allow us to reconstruct temperatures for specific time intervals in which they were formed			0
' @entity8 professor of archaeology @entity104 said : ' we believe this new method of delving into past climates has distinct advantages over other biological proxies			0
' for example , we believe it will work for the full seasonal range of temperatures			0
' the researchers are now collecting samples from archaeological sites dating back thousands of years to build up a picture of past climates and how the future climate will develop			1
dr @entity104 , from the @entity8 ’s @entity118 , added : ' we believe this new method of delving into past climates has distinct advantages over other biological proxies			0
' for example , we believe it will work for the full seasonal range of temperatures , whereas methods such as tree rings , do not ' record ' during winter			0
' in addition , because the chalk balls are found in direct context with archaeological finds , they will reveal temperatures at the same location			0

*experts* monitored the faeces of earthworms kept at different temperatures
using isotopic testing , they found granules of calcite in the earthworm 's poo contained a ' memory ' of its temperature it was when it was excreted
by studying fossilised samples of this excrement , scientists can track changes in the @entity27 's climate over thousands of years
these findings could be now be used to predict future climate trends
