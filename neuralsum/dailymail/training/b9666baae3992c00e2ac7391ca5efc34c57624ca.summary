@entity2 ’s former @entity1 whizzkid @entity0 has reclaimed the @entity4 shirt he wore when tipped to be the next @entity5			1
@entity0 has signed for @entity6 after failing to live up to the early hype when he made his @entity9 debut at 17			1
in a live webchat with @entity2 fans on friday night , @entity0 predicted the good times would return for him in @entity13 and explained why he ’s chosen to wear the 27 shirt this season			1
i wore 11 at @entity29 on loan last season			2
‘ i still feel the same player as i did when i began at @entity1 and i feel i have more experience now that will hopefully help me here			2
’ though unflattering comparisons have been made between @entity1 and @entity2 , 23 - year - old @entity0 has been impressed with the quality of his new team - mates in his first day in training			1
‘ i saw that the idea here is to get the ball down and play good football , ’ he said			2
‘ there are many good players here who want to play with the ball at their feet			0
i think that will suit the style i want to play			0
‘ i know what i am capable of on the pitch			0
i like to get the ball on the ground , make good plays and move the ball around the pitch quickly at a good tempo			0
i like to build good relationships with other players too , which is important			0
’ prodigy : @entity0 was younger than even @entity5 ( r ) when he made his @entity1 debut @entity0 beat @entity5 ’s post-war record when he made his @entity1 debut in @entity63 aged 17 years and 19 days			1
he was capped by @entity21 at 18 and was originally named in their @entity65 squad as a teenager before withdrawing because of fatigue			0
but he ’s not lived up to his teenage promise since , having spells at @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity29 before @entity1 decided to sell him to @entity73 for a nominal fee			1
part of the problem the player believes is that he ’s been used as a winger too often and he is adamant he would like a more central role at @entity2			2
‘ i like to play as a striker or second striker			2
in recent seasons , i have played out wide but i do feel that my best position is in a more central role , ’ he said			0
pot luck : the 23 - year - old has consulted former teammate @entity87 ( @entity88 ) before signing for @entity2 @entity0 consulted with former @entity1 team - mate @entity87 who joined @entity2 last season before agreeing his own switch			1
the forward whose own idol growing up was @entity93 was also aware that manager @entity6 played for @entity1 in the 1980s			1
‘ i wanted to come here to play for a team on the up , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity96 is somewhere i always wanted to play , so this is a good opportunity for me			0
‘ it is a very exciting league and one i am excited to play in			0
@entity6 also told me of the ambitions here and that was important to me			2
’ great expectations : @entity2 will be hoping to improve after signing the likes of @entity102 @entity87 also joined in the webchat and warned @entity0 that he may need to toughen up			1
he said : ‘ i understand that the managers like the players to be stronger maybe than in @entity21 , and over the 12 months , i did a lot of gym work that has helped me			0
’ @entity2 finished ninth last season and @entity6 is hoping to go even higher this season having already signed five new players including @entity0 and @entity111 striker @entity102 .			1
