each has her own sense of style			2
but the wives of @entity4 managed to blend beautifully together yesterday			0
@entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 were a portrait in pastels as they joined the historic order of the @entity12 service at @entity13			1
laughing and chatting , the @entity14 of @entity15 and @entity16 and the @entity7 were waiting together to watch their princes parade past			0
@entity7 wore a pale pink suit - and all three wore nude court shoes snap ! the royal trio ( from left , @entity7 , @entity20 and @entity16 ) wore almost identical shoes with their matching outfits and although the ladies were elegantly subtle in creams , beige blush and pale pinks , there was no chance of missing their husbands in the bright blue velvet cloaks of the @entity47 and hats topped with a froth of feathers			1
founded by @entity51 in 1348 , the @entity12 is the country ’s oldest order of chivalry and the last remaining honour to be given at the discretion of the sovereign			0
prince @entity58 , prince @entity59 and @entity60 were all marching proudly , along with the @entity61 , who is recovering well from his recent illness			0
comparing style notes ? the @entity16 , known for her great sense of humour , entertains @entity5 and @entity7 as they enjoy the procession tender moment : crowds line the streets of @entity4 to watch the @entity15 and prince @entity59 during the procession to the annual @entity73 at @entity74 in the grounds of @entity13 today the @entity61 and @entity20 share a tender moment as they leave the chapel after the ceremony there 's one way to ensure you ’re not outdone by a stylish new addition to the family – turn up wearing almost the same thing			1
yesterday @entity7 and @entity6 co-ordinated their outfits with @entity5 in shades of beige , cream and blush			1
and all three wore the seemingly obligatory nude heels			1
@entity5 gave her @entity27 coat dress ( £ 2,290 ) another outing after she wore it at last year ’s @entity94			1
@entity7 ’s @entity96 suit with shawl collar was first worn to @entity99 ’s wedding last summer			0
also sticking to an old favourite was @entity6 , in a custom - made @entity30 cream chiffon dress and pink coat			2
this glamorous trio is proof , if any were needed , that a style that looks good on a woman in her 30s can also be reworked for a lady in her 60s			0
@entity108 as the procession wound its way through the grounds of @entity13 to @entity74 , a lively @entity6 regaled a giggling @entity7 and @entity5 with amusing tales			1
the three wore remarkably similar outfits in co-ordinating pale pinks and creams			2
@entity5 , 30 , dazzled in a white @entity27 coat dress and @entity119 hat			1
@entity6 , 65 , sported an @entity30 cream chiffon dress and pale pink coat with a dramatic @entity33 hat			2
and the @entity7 , 47 , looked elegant in bespoke @entity96 suit and saucer - shaped hat			0
it was hard to spot the difference when it came to shoes , however			0
@entity5 was in her trusty @entity129 £ 185 nude @entity131 heels			1
@entity6 ’s slightly lower £ 165 heels were from @entity133 at @entity134 and @entity135 while @entity7 went for platform @entity136 at £ 435			0
there was one other big star on the day			0
prince @entity33 , 91 , joined the @entity140 for the half - mile walk from the castle to the chapel			0
she looked delighted to have him at her side again			0
celebration : @entity6 and @entity5 are all smiles as they leave the chapel after the ceremony , while @entity58 seems relieved to be able to remove his velvet hat the @entity61 had recovered sufficiently from his bladder infection to be able to join the @entity140 on the half mile procession from @entity13 to @entity74 's chapel today			1
the two departed in a coach after the ceremony by royal order : the @entity140 herself hands out the @entity12 , and unlike the obe or @entity161 honours list , she does not need to consult the government to discuss who will receive the honour			0
membership in the order is strictly limited and includes the monarch , the @entity59 , not more than 24 companion members , and a number of supernumerary members members of the @entity12 princess anne , princess royal ; prince @entity173 , @entity174 ( centre right ) ; prince @entity176 , @entity177 ; prince edward , earl of wessex ; prince @entity58 , @entity15 and prince @entity59 , @entity59 join the procession @entity180 and sir @entity181 led the procession from @entity13 to the chapel today @entity59 , @entity6 , @entity58 and @entity5 returned by carriage to the castle after the new members were welcomed to the order no doubt grateful for the sunny weather , the royals travelled by open top carriage - a far cry from the wet weather of the jubilee weekend the @entity12 is the most senior and oldest @entity195 order of @entity196 , founded by @entity51 in 1348 majestic : there were spectacular scenes at @entity13 today as the @entity140 was joined by fellow @entity12 members for the annual ceremony at @entity74 's chapel 2011 : @entity5 wore the same @entity27 coat - dress on 16 june last year for the @entity94 ceremony on the @entity140 's official birthday she has earned the moniker @entity5 thanks to her penchant for @entity99 , @entity208 and @entity209			1
but the @entity20 has long been fond of a designer outfit - although she is careful to recycle the most expensive ones on subsequent events , avoiding falling into the trap of being seen as simply a well - appointed clothes horse			2
@entity5 's @entity27 coat - dress , a £ 2,290 garment designed by @entity217 , the designer behind the duchess 's lace wedding dress , had been debuted by @entity5 almost exactly one year ago today			1
@entity5 chose the dress to wear for the @entity94 ceremony on 16 june last year , another spectacular occasion of pomp and pageantry that saw the duchess turn up to support her husband as her wore yet another dramatic outfit			1
the choice of cream today was a wise one - the simple hue made for a neutral backdrop that allowed the vibrant colours and rich fabrics and feathers of her husband 's @entity12 costume to shine			2
equally , just as it did it 's last airing , it co-ordinated perfectly with @entity6 's cream dress - this time an @entity30 piece			2
and @entity7 's pink @entity96 skirt suit topped the trio off nicely			0

@entity5 wore cream @entity27 outfit she *previously* wore for trooping the colour last year
