respected @entity10 law professor @entity7 , 50 , who made national headlines last month after accidentally emailing her students a porn link , has spoken out about reclaiming her dignity since the scandal the legal writing professor , who earned a doctorate from @entity23 , writes that she was sure she had lost her ' dignity forever ' when news of the scandal first broke			1
' everyone was talking about me , ' she said			0
' everyone was speculating about whether i watched porn , or used sex toys , or liked kinky sex			0
some people were calling for my job and law license			0
' the professor said she would not divulge in her column how the mistake happened			2
' if you 're hoping to find out here how that happened , among the many possibilities that have been raised by gleeful commentators , i ’m sorry to tell you you ’re going to be disappointed			0
' but @entity7 did explain her concern that , with a profession where she teaches ' students to project a dignified image ' and ' possess integrity ' , people would no longer believe the teacher could follow her own lessons			1
@entity10 conducted an internal investigation after the incident and found that @entity7 , a tenured professor , had not violated the the university 's sexual harassment and misconduct policy			1
the university said in a statement that federal law requires it investigate all reports of ' inappropriate behaviors of a sexual nature '			2
the professor defends @entity10 's decision to investigate the matter			1
she wrote that critics of the university were ' dismissing the dignity of the law ' and ' giving no consideration to an atmosphere in which the law exists to protect people and an investigation may be necessary '			2
but @entity7 said she wondered why no one thought to question the ' dignity of those who forwarded the unintended post '			1
' no one asked why , if they found it so offensive , students opened the link , with its unmistakable web address , and watched the video long enough to know what it contained , ' she said			2
in fact , @entity7 writes , there was n't anything newsworthy about the mistake she calls ' pretty trivial ' at all			1
' my students are adults			0
the link was quickly removed			0
there was nothing illegal in the video ... yet , because it was porn and i 'm a law professor , news organizations spread the story around the world			2
' @entity7 said she was ' mortified ' and ' in terrible shape ' when she found out she sent her students an explicit link under the subject line ' great article on writing briefs ' on march 31 @entity7 also questions both the dignity of the ' tabloid journalists ' , who called her cellphone number and waited outside her office to interview students , and the ' intended audience ' they knew would want to read the story in the first place			1
readers , she said , ' enjoyed the scandal ( where is @entity116 when you need her ? ) , the thrill of the sexual and the salacious , the speculation '			0
' the professor said the incident made her wonder what the definition of dignity - and who holds the power to decide it - really was			2
' is it the degraded person who lacks dignity ? or the person who seeks to degrade her ? ' she asks			0
' if a person is portrayed as less than dignified , does that mean she is ? who has the power to decide ? ' but @entity7 said that , almost a month later , she has found the power to decide at least what her own personal definition of dignity is - realizing that it 's something she can get back			1
' you can reimagine yourself , and your reputation , and your professional image , ' she writes			0
' you can come to realize that there are worse things than humiliation			0
and there is the willingness — even the desire — to bring others down to lift yourself up			0
' you can go back			0
