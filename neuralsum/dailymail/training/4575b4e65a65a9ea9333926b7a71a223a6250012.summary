the red paint may have been chipped , the bodywork a bit bashed up and the foot has perhaps eased on the accelerator ever so slightly			2
but the juggernaut keeps moving along			2
the notion that a home draw with @entity9 could possibly be construed as a point gained by the @entity11 would have seemed faintly absurd before kick - off			1
eight straight league wins without conceding tends to offer that kind of all - or - nothing perspective			1
by the time @entity17 bundled home the sixth and final goal of an enthralling match deep into injury time , though , no one was thinking of two points lost - save the sizeable , shell - shocked @entity26 contingent of course			1
@entity28 ( left ) celebrates his goal for @entity11 against @entity9 with striker @entity30 two goals behind with three minutes of regulation time to play , the salvation of the match from the league leaders was every bit as remarkable as the fact they had not bludgeoned @entity9 into submission by the time half - an - hour had elapsed			1
it was a captivating , bizarre afternoon			2
the kind of day when neither laughing nor crying seemed appropriate for either manager			2
once breath had been drawn , @entity42 was closer to the former , with @entity44 , his opposite number , solemnly scratching around for positives			2
there were many of those			0
@entity9 were magnificent in patches , most notably in the 10 minutes before half - time when @entity52 and @entity53 finished excellent team moves to cancel out @entity28 ’s opener			1
they were efficient and effective for much of the second period and not ill - deserving of the deflection that took @entity59 ’ volley beyond @entity60 to make it 3 - 1 - only to wilt at the end when their leaden feet became planted in their own box			1
@entity9 's @entity66 ( right ) tries to evade the challenge of @entity11 @entity68 you could only admire @entity11 ’s steadfast refusal to bow down to the seemingly inevitable			1
invigorated by the late introductions of @entity73 , @entity74 and , most tellingly , @entity75 , they strained every sinew to restore parity with two late goals			0
a crowd of nigh on 17,000 inside @entity79 bellowed its approval at their favourites ’ indefatigability			0
if this goes down as a bad day at the office by recent standards , then they will take them now and again			0
it almost goes without saying that , if hopes of the title are to remain alive , they wo n’t want to be emulating @entity96 too often but , occasionally , such acts of escapology are necessary			1
@entity75 , a 19 - year - old contemporary of @entity98 from their @entity99 days , was the unlikely hero of the hour			1
@entity11 's @entity68 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity9 's @entity66 o saturday thrown from the bench to replace @entity30 with seven minutes remaining , he repeatedly displayed that most coveted of striking habits - being in the right place at the right time			1
having made sure @entity105 clipped his ankles to allow @entity107 to score from the spot on 87 minutes , he then teed up @entity17 with a headed flick in the second of four added - on minutes to win a point that was celebrated as fervently as any last - gasp victory			1
the @entity11 may have had their lead at the top over @entity119 cut to two points but , as @entity9 found to their cost , their grasp of the meaning of the word defeat is becoming increasingly flimsy			1
‘ we all believed , ’ said @entity75			0
‘ you never give up in a game and there were still a lot of minutes to go			1
ten minutes is enough to score two goals , as we showed			1
we are delighted to get the draw in the end			0
’ the expected script was being rigidly adhered to when @entity28 smashed @entity136 ’s cross high beyond @entity137 inside seven minutes , the goal stemming from @entity132 picking @entity134 ’s pocket			1
@entity9 's @entity53 runs off in celebration with his arms aloft after he scores against @entity11 for the next 20 minutes , the only debate seemed the margin of @entity11 ’s victory			1
@entity136 somehow missed a pinch from three yards after @entity107 ’ initial shot had been blocked by a defender , @entity17 ’s strike flew a yard wide and @entity9 just could n’t get up for air			1
then , remarkably , having not lost a league goal in 757 minutes , the @entity11 conceded two in 180 seconds			1
@entity52 redeemed himself with a lung - bursting run and a splendid finish to a sweeping six - pass move			1
then , before calm could be restored , @entity53 marched onto @entity156 ’s sumptuous flick and artfully found the bottom corner with the outside of his boot			0
had @entity136 found the net and not the base of the post two minutes after the restart , the game may have veered in a different direction but , as it was , @entity59 ’ fearsome volley , which nipped the leg of @entity167 , a minute later set the hare racing			2
if question marks were raised about whether @entity11 were about to suffer a serious blow to their aspirations , there seemed no doubt about the validity of @entity177 ’s spot - kick award , which @entity107 just about squeezed past the @entity9 keeper and , from that moment on , the visitors were on the ropes			1
@entity9 's @entity53 scores for his side to put them 2 - 1 up against @entity11 @entity184 ’s speculative cross was helped on by @entity75 and @entity17 ’s gamble paid off handsomely as he bundled the ball home from a matter of two yards			1
every title - winning team enjoys such moments of relief			2
@entity42 stated afterwards that it could be a huge point for his side but was characteristically elusive when pressed on exactly what it could mean in the final reckoning			2
improvement - whether week by week or season on season - remains the mantra of those inside @entity79			2
@entity75 , the scorer of 19 goals for the development team this season , is certainly growing in stature and is the kind of livewire presence that suggests the depth of @entity42 ’ squad is very much in keeping with that of a genuine title contender			0
‘ we looked out of it at the end , but i managed to get two assists , ’ beamed the 19 - year - old @entity209			2
‘ the manager sent me on and told me to do what i could			0
he said : “ you have got your minutes on the pitch , so go and do what you can			2
” ‘ the gaffer wants me to score goals and that is my job as a striker			0
i have not managed to score , but i got the assists , so i am happy			0
i try to get myself into good positions on the pitch and , hopefully , i can put one in			0
’ not quite confident enough yet to spot the ball for the penalty he won , however			0
‘ no , there are a few experienced boys and i left it to them , ’ smiled @entity75			0
‘ @entity107 took it well , to be fair			0
’ despite the formidable figures of @entity28 and @entity136 standing ahead of him in the queue for a starting berth , in @entity17 - again invaluable to the @entity11 ’ cause here - @entity75 sees a road map to regular involvement			1
‘ we have a really strong squad and the strikers have been doing really well and scoring goals , ’ he said			0
‘ they have created a lot for the team and so i had to be patient , work hard in training and , when i get my chance , i know i have to have as much impact on the game as i can			0
‘ @entity252 is a good player and we have a lot of them at the club			0
they have taken their chance when it has come along and that is what i need to do to get myself into the team			0
’ and so to @entity259 on friday			0
shorn of @entity167 for around a month after the defender hobbled off with a knee complaint around the hour mark , @entity42 will have to move his pieces around the board and re-strategise			0
but they are still in the game .			0

@entity11 drew 3 - 3 at home to @entity9 in @entity270 on saturday
