@entity1 cyber criminals have destroyed a pump used to supply water to thousands of homes in @entity5 , according to an infrastructure control systems expert			1
hackers accessed the public water facility in the city of @entity10 and are believed to have then broken the pump by remotely turning it on and off in quick succession			2
the incident , which took place on november 8 , sets a worrying precedent for security officials - particularly after another hacker has since claimed to have taken control of a second @entity21 facility			1
hackers using a computer in @entity1 have accessed an @entity5 public water facility and are believed to have then broken the pump by remotely turning it on and off quickly @entity27 , who advises utilities on how to protect themselves against hackers , told the @entity31 news agency : ' this is arguably the first case where we have had a hack of critical infrastructure from outside the @entity21 that caused damage			1
' that is what is so big about this			2
they could have done anything because they had access to the master station			2
' the attack , which is being investigated by the @entity46 and the @entity21 @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , has been traced to a computer in @entity1 , mr @entity27 said			1
it first came to light after mr @entity27 , of @entity51 , posted on his blog quotations taken from a one - page report by the @entity54 and @entity55			2
the report said hackers obtained access using stolen login names and passwords			0
these were taken during a hack on a @entity21 company that makes @entity65 ( @entity65 ) software , which is used around the world to control machines in critical industrial facilities			1
@entity65 software is in place at nuclear power stations and oil rigs ; the @entity5 infiltration therefore sets a frightening precedent			1
mr @entity27 said : ' we do n't know how many other @entity65 systems have been compromised because they do n't really have cyber forensics			0
' further embarrassment : a second hacker has posted this screenshot of the internal control systems for a waste water treatment plant in @entity82 a twitter profile picture of the @entity82 hacker - he claimed said that the water system was only protected by a three - character password he claimed the report said ' glitches ' in the remote access system for the pump had been notices for months before the pump was destroyed			0
' no one realised the hackers were in there until they started turning on and off the pump , ' he said			0
@entity99 , a spokeman for the @entity48 , said : ' at this time there is no credible corroborated data that indicates a risk to critical infrastructure entities or a threat to public safety			1
' however , a hacker using the online name ' pr0f ' has responded to mr @entity99 's statement by claiming to have taken control of a second @entity21 public facility , this time in @entity82 , @entity111			0
astonishingly , he said that @entity65 system was only protected by a three - character password			0
to prove his point , he then posted links - on the @entity122 website - to what he claims are screenshots of the internal control systems for the waste water treatment plant			0
the issue of securing @entity65 systems from cyber attacks made international headlines last year after the mysterious @entity128 virus attacked a centrifuge at a uranium enrichment facility in @entity131			1
many experts said that was a major setback for @entity131 's nuclear weapons program and attribute the attack to the @entity21 and @entity137			1
in 2007 , researchers at the @entity21 government 's @entity139 identified a vulnerability in the electric grid , demonstrating how much damage a cyber attack could inflict on a large diesel generator			2
@entity146 , who retired in september as senior policy adviser to the chairman of the @entity149 , said @entity21 should take the possibility of a cyber attack seriously			2
she said : ' the going in hypothesis is always that it 's just an incident or coincidence			0
and if every incident is seen in isolation , it 's hard - if not impossible - to discern a pattern or connect the dots			0
' failure to connect the dots led us to be surprised on 9/11			0
' representative @entity163 , a @entity164 from @entity165 , said that the report of the attack highlighted the need to pass legislation to improve cyber security of the @entity21 critical infrastructure			1
he said : ' the stakes are too high for us to fail , and our citizens will be the ones to suffer the consequences of our inaction			0

attacks on critical infrastructure set worrying precedent for security officials
