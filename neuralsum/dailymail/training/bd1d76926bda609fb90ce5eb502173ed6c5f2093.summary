by @entity0 published : 15:27 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 15:27 est , 1 august 2013 @entity3 's most active death penalty state is running out of its execution drug , the @entity1 said today			2
@entity6 ' remaining supply of pentobarbital expires in september and no alternatives have been found			1
it was n't immediately clear whether two executions scheduled for next month would be delayed			1
the state has already executed 11 death - row inmates this year , and at least seven more have execution dates in coming months			1
death chamber : @entity1 officials say their remaining supply of pentobarbital - which is what they 've been using to execute inmates in chamber like this one ' we will be unable to use our current supply of pentobarbital after it expires , ' agency spokesman @entity21 said			1
' we are exploring all options at this time			0
' @entity6 switched to the lethal , single - dose sedative last year after one of the drugs used in its three - drug execution process became difficult to obtain and the state 's supply expired			1
other death - penalty states have encountered similar problems after some drug suppliers barred the drugs ' use for executions or have refused , under pressure from death - penalty opponents , to sell or manufacture drugs for use in executions			1
no executions in @entity6 were delayed because of that shortfall			1
' when @entity6 raises a flag that it 's having a problem , obviously numerically it 's significant around the country because they 're doing half the executions in the country right now , ' @entity46 , executive director of the @entity48 - based @entity47 , an anti-death penalty organization , said today			1
' the states really scramble to go all over to get drugs , ' he said			0
' some went overseas , some got from each other			0
but these manufacturers , a number them are based in @entity63 , do n't want to participate in our executions			1
so they 've clamped down as much as they can , ' @entity46 said			0
executions take place in @entity1 @entity71 ( pictured ) some death penalty states , most recently @entity73 , have announced they 're turning to compounding pharmacies , which make customized drugs that are not scrutinized by the @entity76 , to obtain a lethal drug for execution use			2
@entity80 wants to use propofol , the anesthetic blamed for pop star @entity89 's 2009 death - even though the drug has n't been used to execute prisoners in the @entity3 its potential for lethal injection is under scrutiny by the courts and its first use is n't likely anytime soon			0
the @entity90 has declined to allow execution dates to be set in that state until the legal issues are resolved			0
@entity80 attorney general @entity94 recently suggested that if a suitable execution drug ca n't be found , the state should consider the gas chamber			2
state law still allows for execution by lethal gas , though @entity80 no longer even has a gas chamber			0
a return to the gas chamber or electric chair anywhere would be difficult , @entity46 suggested			0
' those things just raise the spectacle level and i do n't think it 's where states want to go , ' he said			0
@entity111 , which has been used along or in concert with other drugs in all executions in the @entity3 the past two years , was more readily available because it was commonly used as a sedative			2
' but i guess restrictions have been put on its distribution , ' @entity46 said			0
' it 's uncertain where all of this goes because it 's inherently a medical kind of procedure involving some health professionals who are largely focused on keeping people alive			0
it runs into contradictions with executions - people strapped to a table			2
executions are n't exactly what the medical model is			2
' @entity6 has by far executed more inmates than any other state in the @entity3 since the @entity90 allowed executions to resume			1
since 1982 , six years after the high court 's order , @entity6 has executed 503 inmates			1
@entity140 is a distant second at 110			0
as of may 2012 , @entity6 had 46 of the 2.5 - gram vials of pentobarbital , presumably enough to execute as many as 23 prisoners since each execution requires a 5 - gram dose			1
the execution wednesday of an inmate convicted in two road - rage killings was the 20th lethal injection since that disclosure .			0

@entity6 ' remaining supply of pentobarbital expires in september and no alternatives have been found
