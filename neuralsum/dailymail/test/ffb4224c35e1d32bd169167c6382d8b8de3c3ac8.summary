a @entity1 man who had his penis enlarged with silicone injections claims it now weighs half a stone			1
@entity6 , has a 9 inch - long , 3.5 inch penis that now weighs between 7.5 – 9.5lbs , between 3 and 4.3kg , he says			1
‘ i ca n’t say exactly how much it weighs , i just know that my kitchen scale , which shows up to 6.6lb , has n’t been enough for a while , ’ he told @entity8			1
mr @entity12 , 45 , who lives in @entity13 , said he had his penis permanently enlarged in this way , not because it makes him feel more beautiful , but because it makes him feel ‘ better ’			1
@entity12 , 45 , has permanently enlarged his penis with silicone injections			1
it is now 9 inches long and weighs up to 9.5lbs ( 4.3kg ) , he claims he uses his satchel to cover up his groin area when he is in public			1
‘ i ’m actually a pretty shy person , ’ he said curiously , the silicone implants provide no physical pleasure and actually make sex much more difficult for him - although it is not impossible			1
he can not get a normal erection – and any increase in size is not visible due to all the silicone			1
but although his giant penis restricts his sex life , he says it makes him more creative in the bedroom			1
he told vice : ‘ after you reach a certain size , you ca n't do certain things any more			1
‘ at least not with everyone and not without some foreplay			2
but there are other things you can do with it			2
you just have to free yourself from established roles and ideas about sex and be ready to play			1
’ mr @entity12 ’s interest in penis modification 20 years ago , when he was given a pump as a present			1
‘ i was way too curious not to try it out			2
first , i tried it secretly for myself , ’ he said			2
‘ and i found that when i went out pumped up , it was a good feeling , it felt great			2
’ mr @entity12 's interest in penis modifications were piqued when he was given a penis pump at 20 - years - old and found it felt ' great '			1
he moved on to saline injections before opting for the more permanent silicone ones ‘ i had the feeling that i was n't trapped in the body i was born with , but that i had the possibility to shape it myself to change it			1
’ he then began enlarging himself with saline injections			1
‘ the feeling was great , ’ he said , ‘ but i did n't like getting the injections - there 's always a risk of infection			1
‘ and also the people around me started to wonder why my groin area would change in size			1
‘ that 's why i started looking for something more permanent			2
’ it took him several years to find out about silicone injections , which were only available in @entity74 when he first began researching them			1
however , rather than seeking professional medical help , he met a medical student who agreed to perform the first injections			1
to date , mr @entity12 has had four procedures which involved injecting silicone into his penis and scrotum			1
however , dr @entity83 , a urologist in @entity13 who carries out penis enlargements , warns that an injecting silicon into the penis can lead to an infection that will leave it ‘ mutilated ’			2
‘ in worst cases , it can lead to an enlarged artery in the scrotum and the testicles die , ’ he told @entity8 journalists , urging people who opt for the procedure to have it done by a medical professional			0
in fact , a 2012 study in the @entity100 , said : ‘ we conclude that penile enhancement procedures with liquid silicone by non-medical personnel could result in devastating consequences			2
’ mr @entity12 said he uses a satchel to cover his modesty and refrains from telling certain people - such as his boss or his extended relations - about his enlarged penis mr @entity12 accepts this advice , and agrees that others thinking of having their penis enlarged with silicone should make sure they are fully informed			1
while his situation might seem extreme , he claims he leads a ‘ normal life ’			0
he said : ‘ i go to work , buy groceries , go to bars , clubs , and to the movies			0
i usually try to make sure it is n't too obvious			0
but i guess it is n't easy buying a new pair of pants			0
’ penis size has been a source of anxiety for men throughout history - and this concern has been found to transcend ethnicity and cultural barriers			1
@entity141 , holy men of @entity136 and male of @entity139 tribe in @entity140 used weights to increase their penile lengths			0
males of the @entity146 tribe in @entity147 resorted to self mutilation by forming holes on their penises and then sticking decorative items through them for their partner 's pleasure			0
brazilians of the @entity157 tribe allowed poisonous snakes to bite their penises in order to enlarge them			0
men in some areas of @entity162 , the @entity163 , @entity164 , and @entity165 have a long history of inserting or implanting various objects in their penises			2
several documented papers have described how ' the bigger the better ' mantra has been the motto for more than a century - and being too small is still regarded as very humiliating in many cultures			0
these stigmas of apparently small penises , as well as the increasing influence of the media on sexual issues , have increased the demand for penile enhancements , figures show			0
however the majority of men who request penile enhancement surgery usually have a normally sized and normally functioning penis , doctors say			2
these patients interpret normal appearances as abnormal , and as such are distressed and depressed			0
source : urology @entity100 he also prefers to urinate sitting down in a cubicle as he attracts odd looks when using urinals			0
while sometimes he says he is pleased to get so much attention , at other points he hides his modesty			0
he uses a satchel bag to ‘ hide his bulge ’ and refrains from telling some people in his life about his physical appearance			0
‘ there are definitely situations when i say “ the other person does n’t need to know right now ”			0
when it ’s the boss or all the extended relations , then i ’ll tell a white lie			0
‘ i ’m actually a pretty shy person , ’ he explains , while leather - clad at a bondage festival			0
indeed , one of his favourite events of the year is the @entity211 – a bondage , fetish and latex affair in @entity13			0
when he attends the carnival , he wears a specially - made pair of latex pants to show off his huge penis			2
speaking of why he loves the event , he said : ‘ you can offer up who you are and show yourself the way you want without having to think about what other people will think of you			0
’ he sometimes worries that potential partners are only interested in him for his manhood			1
he said : ‘ you get reduced to the bulge obviously			0
there ’s always that danger in the relationship			0
‘ but if you take the time to get to know the other person , you find out whether he really loves you or just a part of you			0
’ ultimately , mr @entity12 believed the interest in his penis modification belies deep - rooted sexism			2
‘ if some woman gets breast enlargements , nobody says anything about it , ’ he said			0
‘ if a man does something very similar to his body , it ’s worth making a documentary about it because it ’s so extraordinary			2
‘ i hope that changes soon because the difference really is n’t that big			0
’ mr @entity12 said the silicone implants make sex much more difficult , although it is not impossible			1
he is pictured wearing specially made latex pants at the @entity254 – a bondage and fetish festival in @entity13			0

@entity6 , has enhanced his penis with several silicone injections
it is 9 inches long , 3.5 inches wide and weighs up to 9.5lbs ( 4.3kg ) , he says
the size of his manhood makes sex difficult , although it is not impossible
he worries that *future* partners might only love him for his body
