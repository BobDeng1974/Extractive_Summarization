with @entity115 taking charge of the goalkeepers ' coaching , @entity105 's role largely involves player interaction and specific training drills			0
@entity105 is clearly heavily involved in @entity9 's set - piece practice as @entity0 praised his colleague following @entity124 's brilliant free - kick against @entity125 last october			1
