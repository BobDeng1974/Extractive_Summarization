by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 08:33 est , 13 may 2013 stalking : former @entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 , 32 , admitted harassing his ex-lover relentlessly former @entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 relentlessly harassed his ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him , booking a holiday for them both and even turning up at her office , a court heard			1
ex-england youth international @entity1 was branded a ' true stalker ' by a judge after he admitted harassing the probation officer , with whom he had a six - month relationship after meeting her on a dating website			1
@entity1 , who now sells hair and beauty products online , played for @entity2 and @entity17 as a youngster but left the club without making a first team appearance			1
he later turned out for @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
the 32 - year - old from @entity24 , @entity28 , bombarded his former lover with 70 emails and text messages in a campaign that drove her to the brink of suicide , @entity26 magistrates heard			1
@entity1 , who has since posted online photographs of himself in a bath full of money , was given a 10 - week suspended prison sentence , given a restraining order banning him from contacting his ex-lover , and ordered to pay compensation and costs after admitting harassment last week			1
the court heard that on one occasion @entity1 , who was previously convicted of attacking another ex-girlfriend , even turned up at the woman ’s office and only left when her colleagues threatened to call the police			1
in a statement handed to the judge , his 30 - year - old victim said she was receiving counselling and had even considered suicide after she was harassed by @entity1 last july			1
passing sentence , deputy district judge @entity56 said : ' this was an exceptionally unpleasant case of true stalking behaviour			2
' this is exactly the kind of behaviour that this law was designed to combat			0
' i have been made aware of the very profound effect that this behaviour has had on the victim ’s life			0
this is not the first time you have been convicted of an offence like this and you have a previous record that shows you have engaged in this type of behaviour before			0
' i must pass a prison sentence but can provide greater , long - term protection to those that need it by suspending the sentence			1
' if you fail to moderate your behaviour , you will go to prison for a long time			2
' a foolish brag : @entity1 posted this photograph of himself drinking and smoking in a bath full of money on his @entity90 page last month @entity91 , prosecuting , told the court that @entity1 had been ' very controlling ' during the couple ’s turbulent relationship			1
they broke up last may and @entity1 was given a harassment warning by police after a complaint by the victim			1
but the court heard he then booked a holiday for the couple , without her knowledge , last july and tried to convince her to go with him			1
he mounted the campaign of harassment when she refused			2
between july 10 and 25 , the court heard @entity1 sent dozens of emails and texts and also deposited money into her online @entity114 account			1
he turned up at a probation service office where she worked on july 18			0
@entity118 , defending , said @entity1 ’s behaviour had not been threatening and he had suffered difficulties since the end of his football career			2
mr @entity118 said : ' he accepts he sent a number of emails and messages but they were not threatening in nature			0
' he has suffered from difficulties since his career ended , but he has always participated fully in courses ordered by the courts			0
poor control : the prosecutor said @entity1 , pictured above , had been ' very controlling ' during the relationship ' there is now a degree of openness about his behaviour , which is perhaps more difficult to admit in the macho world he is from			2
' mr @entity118 asked for a suspended jail sentence to be imposed to ensure @entity1 was punished but that there was ' appropriate monitoring and support in respect of him and the people he has relationships with in the future '			1
@entity1 was also ordered to pay the victim £ 750 compensation and £ 135 costs			2
judge @entity56 added : ' no amount of money would really truly reflect what has happened in this lady ’s life			0
' the most important part of the sentence is the indefinite restraining order			1
' if you try to contact her in any way possible you will breach the terms of the suspended sentence and will be sent to prison			1
' @entity1 ’s latest victim told the court her life had ' changed beyond recognition ' since they met and she now planned to quit her job and move abroad			2
a @entity170 in the dock : @entity1 , seen here in the middle row , sixth from left , played for @entity2 and @entity17 as a youngster in a moving witness statement , the woman said : ' i have gone from being a safe , independent and confident woman to someone who is constantly looking over their shoulder			2
' i have never felt so trapped and isolated while in the relationship			0
everything i did and said was in an effort to placate @entity1 and to avoid situations of confrontation and aggression			2
i was constantly treading on egg shells , left feeling confused , in fear for myself , my friends , my family and my pets			0
' i was downtrodden and broken , lacking confidence and spark and i always seemed vacant and distracted			0
' her statement added that she was receiving counselling , had considered suicide and had been prescribed anxiety drugs			0
and the document said her ordeal had also impacted on her job as a probation officer			0
she added : ' my employers had to implement an employee safety plan , which involved the entire centre being alerted to the potential risks of the situation , at huge embarrassment to myself			0
it has affected the way i work with particular cases			0
' i also find it particularly difficult when i am in the courts as part of my job			0
i am still exploring the idea of moving and working abroad , to escape and have a fresh start			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
