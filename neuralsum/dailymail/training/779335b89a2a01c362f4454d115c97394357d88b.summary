@entity0 was planning a terrorist outrage to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11 with @entity4 number one on his hit list			1
the former leader of @entity7 wanted to shoot down the @entity11 president ’s jet @entity8 during a trip abroad			1
he also wanted to murder general @entity13 , the top @entity11 commander in @entity14 , and was still obsessed with using planes to carry out terror attacks			0
attack : @entity0 was planning to bring down @entity8 with president @entity4 on board @entity19 : @entity0 was hoping to take out the presidential jet while it transported @entity4 on a foreign visit plot : @entity0 had been planning to attack the @entity11 on the 10th anniversary of 9/11			1
every year since the initial attack two blue lights have shone in the place of the towers in memory of the victims but was he in control ? other intelligence gleaned from the @entity34 lair suggested @entity0 was losing his grip over @entity7 the terror chief had already begun putting a team of militants together for the attack , according to communications seized by @entity41 from his @entity34 lair			1
ideally one of his followers would fly a jet into a major sporting event in @entity11 , leading to massive loss of life			0
the disclosures came from the ‘ treasure trove ’ of intelligence seized at the mansion hideout in @entity34 where @entity0 was killed during a raid by @entity11 special forces earlier this year			1
officials say that the attack he was planning was in the preliminary stage and that @entity0 had been discussing who would carry it out with his operations chief @entity61			1
the plan was to shoot down air force one or @entity64 , the president ’s helicopter , whilst it was in mid-flight by firing a missile or rocket propelled grenade from another aircraft			0
@entity13 would also be killed in a similar fashion , the documents show			2
former @entity75 agent @entity74 said that despite improvements in security the plan to hijack a small jet and fly it into a sports stadium could work			0
‘ we have so many small airports , you could fly below radar , ’ he said			0
‘ that 's possibly doable			2
' although at the embryonic stage , the details of the plot lead @entity90 acting director @entity89 to tell staff that one of their top priorities was to ensure such an attack never took place			2
the haul of computers and handwritten journals recovered from the compound in @entity101 have taught @entity90 operatives more in the past weeks than they knew in the previous 10 years			0
but he had been having disagreements with his operations chief @entity61 , on who should be included in the attack team , the @entity103 reported			2
interestingly @entity0 may have been losing his grip on control of the terror group			1
according to other materials in the treasure trove of documents found at his @entity101 lair during the may 2 raid , he was often ignored by his henchmen			1
' what we found was that he was very isolated , and it is clearly the case he was struggling to continue to hold on to the type of influence and to direct operations in ways he may have been able to do in the past , ' a @entity11 official said			2
plans for an attack on the 9/11 anniversary were only in the discussion phase , according to @entity11 officials who added they had n't seen any signs the plot was ready to be carried out			0
the plot was one of a smattering of threats to come out of the materials seized during the raid in which @entity0 was killed			1
in those first days afterwards , intelligence officials confirmed there had been strong evidence @entity0 was all for carrying out attacks on significant @entity11 dates - july 4 and september 11 for example			1
but this is the first time they have spoken of an actual attempt planned for this year 's anniversary			0
counter-terrorism staff from half - a - dozen @entity11 agencies have now raked over the entire bounty collected from the raid , but have had little success extracting any concrete leads from the documents			1
intelligence : documents seized in the raid indicated @entity0 was keen to carry out future attacks on significant @entity11 dates , like july 4 , left , and september 11 , right information including phone numbers that could have led to other terrorist leaders were rendered useless almost as soon as they fell into the government 's hands , officials revealed			1
' the treasure trove has not led to any big takedowns , because the bad guys knew we had it and adapted , ' a senior @entity11 official told the @entity103			0
the two phone numbers that @entity0 had sewn into his clothing at the time of his death led nowhere , they added			2
little yield : other material gathered during the raid at the hideout in @entity101 has not led to many concrete leads situation room : @entity4 and vice president @entity185 , along with members of the national security team , and secretary of state @entity188 receive an update on the mission against @entity0 before he is killed by @entity41 one connected to a public phone centre in the tribal areas of @entity34 ; the other was a dead end			1
other numbers scattered about the compound also led nowhere			0
meanwhile relations between the @entity11 and @entity34 continue to go down hill			0
the @entity34 government are livid about the raid , claiming not to have known anything about it before it was carried out			0
historic : president @entity4 announces the death of @entity0 from the @entity205 of the @entity206 on may 2			2
the @entity4 administration has said it has ' no regrets ' about the raid despite relations with @entity34 at an all - time low celebration : thousands took to the streets in @entity214 to celebrate the death of @entity0 ill feeling : the may 2 raid has caused a lot of anti-american feeling in @entity34 and has left relations between the two nations frosty the @entity4 administration , worried about leaks within the @entity34 government , did n't want to tell @entity226 before the raid , it has been reported			2
some @entity11 officials believe certain fractions of the @entity34 government knew about @entity0 's whereabouts			1
the @entity90 has met repeatedly with @entity34 's intelligence agency to try and smooth things over			0
the most recent meeting came today when @entity34 intelligence chief , lt gen @entity234 met with @entity90 acting director @entity89 to discus how the two nations could move forward in the fight against terrorism			0
the @entity4 administration announce last sunday it was suspending $ 800million in aid to @entity34 , as a punishment for what it sees as not aiding the ongoing counter-terrorism threat .			0

documents found at @entity0 's lair reveal attack was in planning stages
other communications seized have not yielded many concrete leads
