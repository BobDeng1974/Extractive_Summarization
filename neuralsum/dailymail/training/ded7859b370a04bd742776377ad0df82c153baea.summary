by @entity0 two leading officials at the scandal - hit police union dramatically quit yesterday , just days after it faced fresh , disturbing questions over its role in the @entity8 affair			1
@entity9 , chairman of the @entity11 , and general secretary @entity12 resigned days after the @entity13 revealed it had hired a @entity15 firm to mastermind a ‘ guerrilla ’ and ‘ blitzkrieg ’ campaign against the government			1
in addition , the @entity13 has run a series of investigations revealing : quit : chairman @entity9 and general secretary @entity12 will step down , plunging the @entity11 into crisis after a turbulent period both mr @entity9 and mr @entity12 were aware of the decision to award a £ 10,000 - a - month deal to a controversial public relations company to oppose @entity28 plans on police pay and reform			1
the ‘ guerrilla tactics ’ deal had been agreed just weeks before the now infamous @entity8 incident in september 2012 , involving then chief whip @entity34 and a policeman at the gates of @entity37			1
critics of the @entity11 argue that the union mercilessly exploited mr @entity34 ’s bust up at the gates as part of its ongoing campaign against ministers who wanted to reform its working practices			1
last week police minister @entity47 said that the @entity11 – which represents 125,000 rank and file officers – should put its house in order or face tough new laws forcing it to reform			0
shock jock : @entity55 was hired to wage ' guerilla war ' on ministers mr @entity9 and mr @entity12 will leave in late may after the union ’s annual conference – plunging one of @entity62 ’s most powerful staff bodies into crisis			1
last night their decision to leave at such a sensitive time was greeted with surprise by senior politicians			0
@entity70 chairman @entity69 will today hear evidence about sir @entity73 ’s highly critical review of the union which called for top - to - bottom reform and an end to a bullying culture			2
last night mr @entity69 said : ‘ i am amazed and surprised by the proposed retirement of two people who have been instrumental in instigating reform in the @entity11			0
‘ these retirements will leave this important organisation with a huge vacuum and leaderless at a time when they need strong direction			0
it will remain to be seen if the @entity11 will continue on the path of change			0
’ home secretary @entity88 said : ‘ as chairman , @entity9 understood that the @entity11 needs to change , and i am sorry that he will be retiring in may			1
‘ if the @entity11 is to have public legitimacy , the @entity91 recommendations now need to be implemented , in full and in good time			0
’ pointedly , mrs may made no comment on mr @entity12 ’s resignation			2
insiders predicted last night that further heads would roll over the @entity11 scandal			0
a source said : ‘ there are a lot of unresolved issues at the @entity11 , not least the offshore bank accounts , outrageous spending on credit cards and general culture of secrecy			1
’ details of the ‘ guerrilla tactics ’ plan were confirmed by a former senior @entity11 official when she appeared before the @entity70 last week			1
@entity113 – who says she was sacked after advocating reform at the @entity11 – said the @entity116 plot was outlined in a contract handed to a public relations company run by former dj @entity55 in 2012			0
the deal , agreed by national @entity11 leaders , lasted only two months but mr @entity55 continued to provide pr advice to three branches of the @entity11 in the @entity123 , all central to the ‘ @entity8 ’ storm			2
but cracks in the @entity11 ’s unity had started to emerge in january , when an independent review of the union by former @entity132 mandarin sir @entity73 concluded that the organisation had a staggering £ 95million in reserves and assets			1
scandal : mr @entity55 provided pr advice to three branches of the @entity11 in the @entity123 , all central to the ' @entity8 ' storm investigators found there were centrally held funds of £ 29.5million and those held by branch boards stood at around £ 35million , but there was also another estimated £ 30million in separate accounts , details of which were not given to the national heads of the organisation			1
in a statement mr @entity9 , who according to miss @entity113 ’s testimony had previously been ‘ bullied and ridiculed ’ by senior colleagues , acknowledged the union had faced a ‘ turbulent period ’			2
the chairman , who has been in the post barely a year , said : ‘ when i took up office it was quite clear that as an organisation we were not fit for purpose and that is why i … commissioned an independent review … it delivered a hard - hitting report that clearly showed that we were not delivering what our members wanted , were failing in key areas and that many of our practices were outdated			0
i have made no secret of my fears that unless we get this right and embrace the change required others will do it to us , a view echoed recently by the policing minister , @entity47			0
’ mr @entity12 , who had been in the post for six years and was regarded as a hardliner on police pay and conditions , said he was stepping down after it became clear he no longer had the support of a number of senior colleagues			0
yesterday it was claimed that the @entity188 was set to reject demands for ‘ top - to - bottom ’ reforms			0
