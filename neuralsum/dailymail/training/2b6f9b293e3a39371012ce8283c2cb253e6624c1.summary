@entity16 had just left the maternity hospital when he was killed in a car crash sleep-fest : @entity16 , played by @entity17 , made a dramatic exit from @entity6 but failed to attract viewers competition : @entity28 ( left ) in @entity29 and @entity30 in @entity31 ( right ) also featured in programmes on @entity14 it was soundly beaten by @entity29 , which was shown at the same time and attracted 9.4million viewers			1
@entity6 was also trounced by @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , and @entity38			1

the @entity14 ratings battle was dominated by the @entity43 , which drew in almost a third of the peak - time viewers , compared to a quarter who watched @entity8			1
the corporation had seven of the top ten programmes			0
however it is believed that many more viewers recorded @entity6 , preferring to watch it after it had been broadcast to avoid the frequent advert breaks			2
@entity8 has previously been criticised for broadcasting one minute of commercials for every three minutes of the programme			2
family ties : @entity76 and @entity77 reunited for their @entity14 special and managed to finish in fourth place @entity14 sickness : @entity31 failed to live up to expectation and only drew in 7.2million viewers despite the dramatic storyline – which included the death of @entity17 ’s character @entity16 after becoming a father – fans said the two - hour episode was too long			2
others said the decision to broadcast it from 8.45pm made it too late for many families			0
it is the lowest ever viewing figure for the programme , which has performed well on sunday evenings			0
the previous lowest was the third episode of series one in 2010 , which got 8.9million viewers			0
the highest - rating episode was the finale of series two which recorded 12.4million			0
one fan wrote on @entity105 : ‘ as much as i love @entity6 i really ca n’t be bothered with two hours of it			0
’ another , @entity108 , wrote : ‘ i looked forward to the @entity109 special , but i came very close to turning it off altogether			0
i stuck with it for the four seconds of action that happened right at the end			0
i wo n’t be watching again			0
’ jumping for joy : @entity117 singer @entity116 leaps over partner @entity118 to win the @entity14 special title it is the fourth year in a row that @entity29 has triumphed in the @entity14 ratings			1
