nearly all are now in good jobs			1
pictured is @entity7 near @entity8 nearly half of pupils from poorer backgrounds whose private school fees were paid by the last @entity14 government are now earning at least £ 90,000 a year			1

a study revealed ‘ virtually all ’ have gone into well paid professional and managerial positions , including more than 40 per cent whose annual pay is £ 90,000 or more – nearly four times the national average salary of £ 24,000			1
two - thirds said the economic crisis had not affected their standard of living			1
even those who did n’t go on to university were still found to be in ‘ solidly middle - class occupations with a good income ’			1
most also reported they believed their schools had helped them develop important personal attributes including self - discipline and self - reliance			1
the @entity33 , which campaigns to improve social mobility through education and commissioned the report , said its findings were powerful evidence that a similar scheme should be brought back			2
chairman sir @entity40 said : ‘ the new research shows the extent to which able children from less advantaged homes gain from an independent school education			0
‘ it shows the importance of ensuring that access to the best independent day schools is not restricted to those who can afford to pay full fees			2

report author professor @entity94 said : ‘ the relative unimportance the @entity3 holders attach to factors such as luck and social background suggests that , for these individuals , the scheme alleviated the impact of socio - economic disadvantage			1
’ the @entity33 set up a similar scheme at @entity105 in @entity106 from 2000 to 2007 , with all places based on merit alone			0
