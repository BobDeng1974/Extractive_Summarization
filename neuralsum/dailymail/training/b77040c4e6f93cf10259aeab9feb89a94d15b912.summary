@entity0 broke the habit of a lifetime on sunday , winning an away game against one of their top - four rivals			1
their 2 - 0 win over @entity8 could well be a watershed moment in the @entity11 ' stuttering season			1
but what was different about @entity14 's side at the @entity15 and what lessons can they learn going into future clashes against their direct rivals ? @entity0 boss @entity14 got his side 's tactics spot on as they won 2 - 0 away at @entity8 1 ) discipline and concentration throwing away leads in search of more goals has been an unwanted characteristic of @entity0 's season so far			1
conceding a 3 - 0 lead against @entity29 in the @entity30 has been one of the low - lights of their campaign			1
but there was no gung - ho approach against @entity8			2
having taken the lead through @entity38 's penalty , the @entity11 were much more conservative , remaining compact , not trying to stretch the game as they stifled @entity8 's attack			2
@entity38 's first half penalty gave @entity0 a platform to build upon in sunday 's 2 - 0 win at the @entity45 the diminutive @entity46 international ( left ) celebrates his opener with @entity49 ( centre ) and @entity51 2 ) killing the game it 's not , perhaps , in keeping with @entity0 's attacking mantra but they showed guile and know - how of getting over the line at the @entity45			1
time wasting in the corners , passing the ball sideways and backwards all wastes valuable seconds when you are ahead in a game			0
we do n't usually see @entity0 lower themselves to that sort of thing			0
but they did on sunday and came away with the best win of the season so far			0
@entity0 's second goalscorer @entity49 ( centre ) held the ball up well as the visitors closed the game out 3 ) @entity77 - midfield enforcer @entity0 have been crying out for an out - and - out defensive midfielder all season			1
it looks like they have found one in @entity82			0
the young @entity83 was instrumental against @entity8			0
breaking up play in midfield and passing the ball to those who can do damage			0
whether @entity77 is the answer to the @entity11 midfield conundrum in the long term remains to be seen			0
but , for the time being , @entity14 looks to have the midfield enforcer he has been desperate for			0
@entity77 ( centre ) had an excellent game in midfield for the @entity11 protecting the defence 4 ) mixing it up we all know @entity0 can pass the ball as well as most teams in @entity101 , but they showed a different side to their game on sunday			1
goalkeeper @entity105 's long balls into centre forward @entity49 was a feature of the @entity11 ' game plan			0
is it a shame @entity14 's side were forced to part with their passing principles ? perhaps			1
but @entity0 supporters certainly wo n't be concerned about that this morning			0
@entity105 's ( left ) long balls into @entity49 were one asset of an astute tactical plan deployed by @entity0 5 ) happy not to have the ball @entity0 are most comfortable with the ball at their feet ; when they dictating play			2
but on sunday they had just 35 per cent of possession - but came away with a 2 - 0 win			1
figure that one out ? you do n't always have to control the pace of a game to win it , as the @entity11 proved as they stifled @entity8 's attack			2
they showed efficiency in their counter-attacks against @entity134 's side			1
they had three shots on target - two of which were goals			0
gunners used the counter-attack to good effect against @entity8 - with @entity51 ( left ) a key weapon on the break			2

gunners had just 35 per cent of possession in their @entity45 *victory*
@entity14 's side were tactically set up *brilliantly* against @entity8
