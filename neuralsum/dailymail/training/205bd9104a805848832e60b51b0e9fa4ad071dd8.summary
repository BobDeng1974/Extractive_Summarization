by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 16:24 est , 8 september 2012 for decades , it has been the picturesque gateway for millions of visitors to the @entity3			2
countless sightseers en route to the rolling countryside have discovered the gentle charms of @entity8 , with its cobbled , tree - dotted @entity10 market square , traditional tea shops and the famous @entity13			2
but now the tranquillity of the ancient town on the banks of the @entity17 has been punctured by a very @entity19 battle between residents and the bureaucrats they blame for pushing it ‘ off the map ’			2
once a popular tourist route to the @entity26 , the picturesque village of @entity8 is now far quieter as passing trade is no longer directed to the village visitor numbers have plummeted since long - standing road signs directing drivers to the town from the nearby @entity33 were removed as part of a multi-million - pound upgrade of the dual carriageway to a six - lane motorway			1
the original turn - off to the town was closed and no new signs were erected at a new junction two miles further south			1
many drivers now do not leave the @entity33 until the next junction , about 11 miles further north – depriving local businesses of hundreds of thousands of pounds in passing trade			1
caravan park owner and parish councillor @entity46 , 66 , will soon permanently close her @entity49 cafe on the road into @entity8 , with the loss of five part - time jobs and an estimated annual income of £ 50,000 to £ 60,000			1
she said : ‘ we used to be open most days of the week but recently we have reduced this to weekends , which is not sustainable			2
the number of cars on this road has dropped hugely			1
’ in the market square , @entity60 , who runs a plant and pet food stall , said : ‘ something needs to be done			0
we are losing passing trade as tourists use other routes			1
’ @entity13 's @entity68 relies heavily on passing trade			0
pictured attending the @entity69 held at the end of september in the village @entity71 @entity73 , who has run the sweet shop @entity75 for eight years , said : ‘ business has been dreadful			1
i have experienced a 20 per cent drop in sales			1
some people think the issue of the signs is a small matter , but to us it is having a significant impact			0
’ her sentiments are echoed in other shops , from the @entity87 to the @entity89 tea rooms			0
@entity91 chairman @entity90 warned that other businesses , from a farm making its own ice cream to a restaurant favoured by @entity96 , are also vulnerable			2
‘ the route through @entity8 and the lower @entity99 area is about 12 miles long , and other villages such as @entity101 could lose out , ’ he said			0
‘ we are not talking about a pub and six houses			0
there are hundreds of businesses involved			2
’ the parish council was told it would have to pay more than £ 36,000 to erect brown tourist signs , an amount it can not afford			0
@entity111 , the 36 - year - old marketing director of the renowned @entity113 brewery , one of two in the town run by the @entity118 brewing family , said his business relied heavily on the tourists who stopped off at its visitor centre			2
‘ i am extremely angry , ’ he said			0
‘ it has been such a long campaign and now they say we have to pay			0
this is one of the most iconic and well - known tourist areas in the country			0
’ his cousin @entity130 , 55 , the executive director of @entity13 in @entity8 , added : ‘ i do n’t think the government could have done a better job in inconveniencing people			0
i do n’t know who is to blame , but whoever it is should be deeply embarrassed			0
i am angry because it is completely incompetent			0
’ the traditional junction on the @entity33 for @entity8 was closed as part of an upgrade of the road			1
under a scheme agreed between the @entity142 and the @entity143 , a new turn - off was created – junction 50 – some two miles further south			1
the roads into and out of the @entity3 village are far quieter since the changes were made to the @entity33 but parish councillors in @entity8 – pronounced ‘ @entity153 ’ – say it was only when the disruptive road - widening work began that they found out all six signs that had previously directed drivers to @entity8 were to disappear and would not be replaced			1
councillors were told that because the @entity33 was becoming a motorway , new criteria applied , and @entity8 did not qualify for signs as it was not a ‘ primary destination ’			1
however , after a campaign by @entity161 mp @entity160 , the @entity162 ruled @entity8 could have two large brown tourist signs at the new @entity164 to help regenerate its flagging tourist trade			0
but as the signs are ‘ outside normal regulations ’ , the town was expected to fund them itself			0
businesses in the picturesque village of @entity8 are in uproar as the traffic to the village has fallen dramatically due to the lack of signs to the horror of mr @entity160 , an initial assessment by the @entity143 costed the two signs at £ 190,000			1
this was eventually reduced to £ 36,000 on the condition that the parish council would sign an open - ended deal agreeing to meet any unforeseen extra costs – something the council feared could lead to bankruptcy			0
mr @entity160 said : ‘ i have been staggered by the sums of money quoted for the installation of two brown signs and very disappointed by the lack of appreciation by the @entity143 of the devastating economic impact that not having signage is having on @entity8			1
’ last night , the @entity143 said it has now placed tourist signs to @entity8 for motorists driving down from the north – at @entity200 where the @entity33 is still a trunk road – but that it was still trying to find an ‘ affordable solution ’ for drivers travelling from the south .			1

work to expand the number of lanes on @entity33 has resulted in the village losing its *signpost* and its old exit
traders say sales are down at least 20 per cent this year due to the changes
some businesses have gone bust *including* a local cafe
the @entity143 is trying to find an affordable solution to the problem for traffic coming from the south
