it is one of the most mysterious substances in the universe , but it appears dark matter could hold the key to the future of our species			2
scientists have found evidence that suggests encounters between the @entity13 and concentrations of dark matter in our galaxy trigger mass extinctions			1
they claim that as the @entity13 hits patches of dark matter , it can lead to additional heating of our planet 's core , causing geological events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions			1
dark matter clustered within the dense disk of the @entity28 ( shown above ) could trigger extinction events by sending comets on a collision course with our planet and sparking geological disruption on the @entity13 the dark matter is also thought to disrupt the orbits of comets , potentially sending them on a collision course with the @entity13 , such as the strike 66 million years ago that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs			1
dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			2
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			0
the @entity54 says : ' shine a torch in a completely dark room , and you will see only what the torch illuminates			0
' that does not mean that the room around you does not exist			0
' similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly			2
' scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe , but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it			0
professor @entity73 , a biologist at @entity74 , has found that these events appear to occur every 30 million years , broadly in time with our solar system 's path through the galactic disk of the @entity28 in a scientific paper for the @entity81 , he said the @entity13 could be still be experiencing the effects of the most recent encounters and may even result in future extinctions			1
he said that the solar system is thought to have last passed through the plane of the @entity28 around two to three million years ago and this might explain a cluster of recent impact craters and a minor extinction event in the @entity91			1
professor @entity73 said : ' several researchers have suggested that we are in a comet shower at present			2
' this may be a long - term driver of evolution , since the mass extinctions are followed by evolutionary radiations filling all the vacant niches			2
' of course , if we are in a shower now we might expect enhanced rates of large body impacts			0
' he also said that the heat generated in the @entity13 's core by dark matter can take millions of years to bubble to the surface			1
professor added : ' we are fortunate enough to live on a planet that is ideal for the development of complex life			0
' but the history of the @entity13 is punctuated by large scale extinction events , some of which we struggle to explain			1
' it may be that dark matter – the nature of which is still unclear but which makes up around a quarter of the universe – holds the answer			2
' as well as being important on the largest scales , dark matter may have a direct influence on life on @entity13			2
' our solar system sits on a sprial arm of our galaxy , the @entity28 , as can be seen in the graphic above the study found the @entity13 's path through the main disk of the galaxy ( marked with x on the solid line ) coincide with impact craters ( hatched area ) , floods of volcanic bassalt ( dots ) and mass extinctions ( arrows ) if he is right , then it would mean that the future of life on @entity13 and our own civilisation may be determined by encounters with clumps of dark matter in the future			1
dark matter is thought to be clustered in dense clumps within the plane of the galactic disk of the @entity28 galaxy			1
this is the area of our spiral shaped galaxy that is particularly crowded with stars and interstellar dust			0
although dark matter can not be seen with conventional telescopes , it thought to exist due to the gravitational effects it has on the light and matter around it			2
our own solar system sits on one of the spiral arms of the galaxy but as it orbits the supermassive blackhole at the heart of the @entity28 , it follows a wavy path that winds through the plane galactic disk every 33 to 42 million years			1
dark matter can not be seen directly with telescopes but its effect on the light from other objects in the universe can be seen , like the ghostly rink in the picture taken by the @entity185 above professor @entity73 claims that as the solar system passes through the patches of dark matter here , the gravity it produces can disrupt the huge swarm of comets that sit in the @entity195 cloud around the very outer edges of our solar system			1
this can throw them into the inner reaches of the solar system and some can impact the @entity13			1
he found that there appeared to be regular correlations between extinction events on @entity13 and the movement of the solar system through the galactic disk			1
his conclusions echo those made by @entity211 and @entity212 at @entity213 in @entity214 who calculated last year that the solar system would move through a dark matter disc every 35 million years			1
they said this matched a similar pattern seen in comet impacts on @entity13			0
professor @entity73 , however , also claims that major geological events also appear to be correlated to this movement through the galaxy and may also trigger extinctions			0
he said that major changes in sea level and tectonic episodes appeared to occur on a 26 - 27 million year cycle			0
dark matter may be linked to increases in volcanic activity by heating up the @entity13 's core , the paper claims professor @entity73 believes that dark matter particles could become trapped within the @entity13 's gravity and accumulate in the @entity13 's core , where they may reach densities high enough for mutual annihilation			1
this , he says , would release huge amounts of energy and heat the planet 's interior , leading to geological disruption millions of years later			0
if correct , this could mean the @entity13 will experience an increase in earthquakes and volcanoes as a result of the last crossing our solar system made through the plane of the @entity28 two to three million years ago			1
it could explain why geologists are finding that the @entity13 appears to be growing more active - certainly compared to the 20 year period since the mid- 1970s			0
professor @entity257 said : ' excess heat near the core - mantle boundary could trigger upwelling plumes of mantle material			0
' these plumes could rise to the surface in possibly as short as a few million years , depending on mantle vicosity			0
' the plumes would create volcanic hotspots , rift apart continents and perturb mantle convection , possibly leading to pulses of tectonic unrest , changes in direction and rate of sea floor spreading and associated changes in volcanism , sea level and climate			0
' geological events that have been thought of as independent occurrences might have common roots and might be partly related to extraterrestrial forces			0

scientists have found a correlation between extinction events on @entity13 to the path our solar system takes through crowded areas of the @entity28
the galactic disk of the @entity28 contains dense clumps of dark matter
our planet is thought to encounter these roughly every 30 million years
researchers claim the dark matter can throw comets into our solar system
it also may heat up the core of our planet and trigger geological activity
scientists say this may explain the timings of mass extinctions on @entity13
recent encounters with dark matter may have triggered a comet shower
