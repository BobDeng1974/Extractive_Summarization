charged : @entity0 , 40 , now faces aggravated assault , abuse and neglect , and bail violation charges in connection with @entity7 's death last thursday a malnourished young disabled woman who weighed only 40 pounds has died and her mother has been charged for having a role in her condition			1
@entity12 was 22 - years - old and had been previously diagnosed with cerebral palsy			0
her mother @entity0 , 40 , now faces aggravated assault , abuse and neglect , and bail violation charges in connection with @entity7 's death last thursday			1
local @entity22 station @entity20 reports that authorities had been previously alerted to the alleged abuse that the mother inflicted on her daughter when @entity0 was ordered to stay away from @entity7 after the young woman was found in a hot car			1
at the time of that august 2013 incident , @entity7 weighed 55 pounds and was five feet tall and was tested to have traces of methamphetamine in her system			0
police were called to the scene when there were reports that people - including @entity0 - were doing drugs in a nearby home			2
when police arrived , they found @entity7 in the car with the engine off and the windows rolled up all the way			2
@entity0 's brother then took @entity7 to his house after the incident and told the station that his mother , @entity7 's grandmother , took care of the girl before her death			1
malnourished : @entity12 , pictured , was severely neglected but her mother 's live - in boyfriend claims that she did her best for the girl , even though she is now facing multiple abuse charges questions : relatives do not know how the young woman 's condition got so drastic , and she was unable to communicate making the investigation process even more difficult when police got involved last year @entity7 's condition is so drastic that she was completely unable to communicate , so family members and investigators do not know how her health deteriorated so dramatically			1
@entity20 spoke to @entity0 's unidentified brother at that point , after a meeting with @entity74 's services , and the mother reportedly said that there was an explanation - but her relatives contradicted her statements			1
' she told them she has a eating disorder and when she eats , she spits up and she spits the food back out and does n’t consume it , which has not happened since we ’ve had her , ' @entity0 's brother told the station			2
at some point , @entity86 returned @entity7 to her mother 's care - which @entity0 's boyfriend said was because he could n't handle the demands of an individual with special needs - and the situation did not improve			1
neglect : @entity7 was about 5 - feet tall and 22 years old but only weighed what a toddler normally weighs it is unclear exactly when @entity7 's uncle @entity86 brought her back to her mother , but both @entity0 and @entity7 were injured in a house fire in early may - just weeks before @entity7 was found dead			1
@entity0 took @entity7 to a house in the @entity104 neighborhood of @entity22 where there was no electricity and she left her there for an unreported reason			0
police responded to that scene when there was a fire and both @entity0 and @entity7 were inside			2
they both had to be treated for burns sustained in the fire			0
neither @entity0 nor her brother , who was only identified by @entity116 using his first name , have spoken publicly since @entity7 's death last week , but @entity0 's longtime boyfriend has said that she was doing the best she could and she should not be blamed			1
' @entity0 's the only one who ever cared for that child or done anything			0
she 's the only one who would , ' @entity122 told @entity20			0
defending his girlfriend : @entity122 said that @entity0 did the best she could and was the only one who cared about @entity7 ' nobody wants to change the diaper of a 22 - year - old kid			1
nobody wants that ! ' he went on to claim that while @entity86 did take care of @entity7 after the august arrest , it did not last long and he quickly returned the young woman to her mother because he could not handle the constant care she needed			2
' they tried to give the kid to everybody - nobody wanted her ! nobody ! ' mr @entity122 said			0
' the police would n't even do anything about it			0
they said " nobody wants her , what can we do ? " now y'all are going to lock people up for trying to take care of a child			0
' single mother raised three kids on her own and worked with disabled children all her life - why was she on her own ? this was a terrible accident to happen .			0

@entity12 , 22 , was severely malnourished and unable to communicate *due* to her *disability*
police *originally* took her out of the care of her her mother @entity0 , 40 , last year after she was found in a hot car while @entity0 was doing drugs
@entity7 was sent to live with her uncle , @entity0 's brother , but he ' returned her to @entity164 because he could n't handle the special care '
at the time , the then - *21* - year - old weighed 55lbs
now @entity0 faces abuse and aggravated assault charges over her daughter 's death
