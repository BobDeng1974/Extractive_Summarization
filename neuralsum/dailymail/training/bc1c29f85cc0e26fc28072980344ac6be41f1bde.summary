a dating expert set out to find out exactly what attracts men to women on @entity4 , and ended up proving men can be as superficial as feared when it comes to choosing matches			0
@entity8 set up two contrasting profiles , using doctored images of herself and a ' dumbed down ' bio on one on to find out whether men preferred the real her - or a more superficial ' sexy ' version of herself			1
the @entity14 - based dating pro tested the relationship between the type of attention women get on @entity4 in relation to the type of profile they created			0
@entity8 created two contrasting profiles on the dating app ; one for ' real ' @entity8 ( left ) and one for her sexed up alter ego ' @entity25 ' ( right ) the 27 - year - old created two accounts - with the first for ' normal @entity8 ' describing herself as a yoga and hiking geek , who loves peanut butter and runs her own business			1
the first account also used photographs that showed @entity8 on holiday abroad or in everyday situations , such as after a workout at the gym			2
the profile for fictitious ' @entity25 ' was then given the ' ultimate @entity4 selfie makeover ' with false eyelashes , hair extensions and ample cleavage on show , as well as enhancing the photos with various filters			1
and the much more simplistic bio simply read : ' @entity48			1

the real @entity8 's profile used undoctored photos that showed her on holiday or in everyday situations the first profile for @entity8 received 195 matches - but this was beaten by @entity25 who received 324 matches but while the ' sexier ' profile got the most male attention - @entity86 found that men were more genuinely interested in her and interacted more with the profile that listed her interests and hobbies			1
@entity8 , who has helped more than 100,000 men find love , said : ' i decided to do the video because we live in a world that is lived out online			2
' i was concerned that people were buying into a fake ' perfect ' version of reality : rather than focusing on the real life changes that could find them a better partner			0
' i was pleasantly surprised though that although the fake ' sexy ' profile did better , there seemed to be more sincere interest in ' real ' @entity8			2
' the message seemed to be whatever you put out there will come right back to you			0
