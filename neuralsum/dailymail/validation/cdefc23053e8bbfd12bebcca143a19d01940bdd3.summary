of all the players @entity2 might have expected to drive the final nail into their @entity5 coffin @entity0 was a long way down the list , but it was the former @entity9 midfielder who got the goal on wednesday night			1
here @entity12 takes a closer look at the @entity15 midfielder more than proving his worth in his first season at the @entity18			0
@entity0 superbly lifts the ball over the on - rushing @entity20 to give @entity21 the lead against @entity2 @entity0 loops the ball over @entity20 and past @entity23 to earn @entity21 a 1 - 0 lead at the @entity18 when he signed in the summer what was the reaction ? there was no hysteria but it was considered a welcome addition for two reasons – firstly they need midfielders after selling @entity32 to @entity33 and @entity34 to @entity35 , and second @entity0 was , along with his fellow countryman @entity36 , the best midfielder in @entity37 last season			1
is he an improvement on the aforementioned @entity32 and @entity34 ? @entity34 has the potential to be the best of the three but appalling luck with injuries has stalled his career			0
is @entity0 better than @entity32 ? probably not but he has many of the same characteristics so that has made him a worthy replacement			2
the @entity49 international challenges for the ball with @entity2 midfielder @entity51 @entity0 was brought to @entity21 from @entity9 for £ 14million to replace @entity32 , who joined @entity33 and those characteristics are ? he is versatile in as much as he can play behind the striker and score goals as he did regularly for his former club @entity9 and he can play deep in front of the centre - back as he also did , although less so for his former team , and as he did for @entity21 last saturday away at @entity59			1
much like his compatriot at @entity61 , he can tackle , pass , and shoot			0
he ’s a very complete midfielder			0
who brought him to @entity64 ? @entity9 signed him from @entity65 for € 2.5m			1
it was another work of genius from the club ’s @entity68 because within a very short space of time it was clear @entity0 was destined for bigger things and would make the club a tidy profit			2
@entity0 ( laying down on left of trophy ) captained @entity9 to @entity79 glory in 2014 @entity0 was born in @entity80 but plays international football for @entity49 did he consider @entity82 ? his wife , @entity83 , is a hairdresser from @entity9 , and so he preferred to stay in @entity64			1
when @entity21 came calling it was a no - brainer			1
he was close to going to @entity33 as a 16 - year - old but his father advised him to move to @entity65 instead			1
the language was not going to be a problem wherever he went because the @entity80 born @entity15 international speaks five languages			0
and his battle with @entity36 will be one to look out for on sunday ? it will			0
and even more so because @entity0 was denied the chance to face his international team - mate in the first @entity95 of the season because he was left out of the starting eleven			1
@entity0 is mobbed by his @entity21 team - mates after opening the scoring against @entity2 on wednesday midfielder @entity0 is joined in celebration by @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 how did that work out for @entity104 ? badly			1
many had tipped the coach to resist the temptation of giving @entity101 his debut after so long out , move @entity109 forward to the front three and bring in @entity110 alongside @entity0			0
instead @entity104 dropped @entity0 despite the fact that he had been playing well and lined @entity110 up alongside @entity109			0
‘ they are great players but they are not getting any younger , ’ @entity112 told me after the game			0
@entity21 started well but lost control of midfielder and ultimately the match			2
without @entity0 they were completely out - run in the middle of the park			2
when he is at his best , he is their engine			0
now he ’s back in the team for good ? he did n’t start against @entity127 and @entity21 lost 1 - 0			2
he then played and scored against @entity128			0
he is becoming a leader on the pitch and has bought into the ideas of sacrifice and generosity at @entity21 having been very much the talisman of the team at @entity9			1
when he scored against @entity138 he approached the bench to dedicate the goal to his best pal in the dressing room – the @entity144 keeper @entity143 and he even said of @entity104 : ‘ he knows what he is doing , we have to trust in him			0
’ former @entity9 and @entity65 midfielder @entity0 attempts to escape the attention of @entity147			1

@entity0 scored winning goal against @entity2 on wednesday
@entity49 midfielder joined @entity21 from @entity9 last summer for £ 14m
@entity0 was close to joining @entity33 at 16 but opted for @entity65 instead
@entity154 tells you all you need to know about the 27 - year - old
