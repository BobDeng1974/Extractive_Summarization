by @entity0 captain fantastic @entity1 spared @entity4 's blushes after earning @entity5 a 3 - 2 win - with two goals - against @entity10 minnows @entity8			1
the @entity12 side was two down with 16 minutes to go - after being roughed up by 16st powerhouse @entity13 ' @entity16 ' @entity15 and outrun by the hungry stars of the 12 - year - old football club			0
but the half - time introduction of @entity1 and @entity20 turned around their fortunes and helped them to triumph			1

subs not used : @entity78 the @entity79 were undone by an @entity45 header inside 40 seconds before @entity81 crashed a penalty past @entity60			0
@entity1 pulled one back for his side and @entity71 levelled things up with seven minutes left on the clock			1
only for @entity1 to grab the glory - after a summer spent on holiday instead of at the @entity88 – and help his side keep face			2
the opener stunned the travelling fans at @entity28			0
@entity5 conceded a harmless looking early corner but when @entity94 whipped it in and @entity45 out - jumped the @entity12 side 's defence @entity5 were stunned			2
the visitors had plenty of the ball for the remainder of the first - half but it was largely passed along the back - four and occasionally lent to midfielder anchorman @entity102 who all - too - often played it safe or sidewards			2
@entity8 then produced another shock when they doubled the lead with six minutes of the half left			0
an ideally lofted pass into @entity48 allowed the tireless forward to control the ball and cut across @entity61 in one movement that left the centre - back perplexed			1
@entity111 went @entity48 and @entity61 should have got his marching orders as he was clearly the last man but no cards were shown , clearly due to the games ' friendly ' status			0
the only thing @entity5 fans had to smile about , based on saturday 's performance , was their occasional witty song about @entity15 's hulking figure			0
physical : @entity122 ( left ) tussles with @entity43 ( right ) as he stretches to keep the ball in play big man : @entity15 ( left ) shrugs off the challenge of @entity5 youngster @entity62 ( right ) benched : @entity5 skipper @entity1 takes his seat on the substitutes ' bench before kick - off but the man labelled the ' strongest man in @entity136 football ' due to his ability to benchpress 180kg – almost twice his bodyweight - looked like he was well on his way having the last laugh			1
time after time he rolled defenders , shook off challenges and shrugged off the attentions of @entity5 's million - pound men before he was withdrawn on 66 minutes with his side in charge			1
@entity5 's first good chance of the match did n't arrived until the 44th minute when @entity62 , playing at left - back , surged forward into oodles of space but his effort was poor and gifted @entity8 another goal - kick			1
@entity5 rung the changes at half - time and @entity63 should have scored when he was found at the back post , with a lofted pass , but he was caught between a header and volley and let the ball drift out			1
my ball ! @entity8 's @entity45 ( right ) tugs back @entity5 youngster @entity78 ( left ) animated : @entity4 shouts instructions to his players during an eventful clash in south west @entity166 substitute @entity69 was then left unmarked to take aim at @entity40 's goal with an easy header but it was straight at the grateful keeper			2
@entity8 's dogged defence could not hold out forever and was finally breached by the @entity5 skipper on 74 minutes when he arrived late at the back - post and poked home			2
@entity4 's men finally found some momentum and were soon level			0
the @entity178 picked up a pass from deep meandered through the @entity181 ' defence and rifled home to hurt the depleted @entity181 and , with the home side all out of gas , it was down to @entity1 to rise to the occasion			0
with seconds left he jumped above the shattered @entity181 players to nod home at the front post and crush the @entity8 dream .			0

@entity1 came off the bench at half - time to score twice
@entity5 had been 2 - 0 down but fought back to win
@entity71 grabbed the @entity79 ' *equaliser* to make it 2 - 2
@entity37 , @entity63 and @entity61 also in *action*
