stick or twist ? that was the dilemma for @entity1			1
move or die ? they have taken the right decision , but they are going in the wrong direction			2
sentiment and tradition are all very well , but in the professional era they sometimes have to give way to cold , hard reality			0
@entity1 ’ tenancy in @entity13 was n’t working			1
crowds of 5 - 6,000 simply wo n’t suffice			0
no wonder the club have been losing £ 3million a year			0
the announcement of their relocation to @entity19 has been accompanied by an outcry on behalf of the supporters , but a lack of them is one of the primary problems			0
of course , the loyal followers who turn up at game after game are entitled to vent their angst , but the bottom line is that the club had to gamble on developing a larger fan - base elsewhere			0
that ’s modern sport – for better or worse			2
@entity1 ' @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 during the announcement of a new stadium and sponsor @entity39 ( right ) speaks to press during the announcement of @entity44 as the new club sponsors @entity1 ’ training ground in @entity47 is sub-standard , as is the venue they have played in for so long			1
shifting to the @entity50 and – eventually – a new , purpose - built training ground in @entity19 makes sense in terms of facilities and growth potential , but not in terms of geography			1
why the @entity58 ? this column ’s misgivings are not sentimental ones			2
@entity1 may have been a ‘ @entity64 ’ club for the bulk of their long history , but in the professional era they have drifted , from @entity66 to @entity68 ’s @entity67 and on to @entity69 – 30 miles from the capital			1
alternative options in their familiar territory were considered and discarded			0
they have decided to take the caravan to a large city with a strong rugby heritage , which is wise , but it is in a congested area of elite clubs			2
worcester are angry at what they regard as rivals parking a tank on their lawn , with some justification			0
@entity86 are even nearer – just 24 miles away and @entity87 are also in close proximity			1
a major sponsorship deal partly explains the choice of location , but they had a prime chance to expand the map of the sport in this country , which is too narrow			0
large swathes of the south and east represent an untapped market			0
three regular starters in the @entity102 team ; @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , come from @entity106 and the impressive @entity107 is hosting @entity108 matches next year			1
why not harness that galvanising factor and head for the coast ? there are potentially suitable stadia in @entity114 and @entity115 too , or @entity116 and @entity117 – where the @entity119 brothers hail from			1
@entity120 have only recently returned to the @entity50 after a year away wasps are moving away from @entity122 , located in @entity13 , to further their ambitions as a club places exist where an ambitious club could establish strong roots , without straying on to patches which are already occupied			1
but now that @entity1 have made their decision , more pertinent even than the grievance of fans will be the views of the players			1
if their leading men are prepared to embrace the relocation and strong links are forged with @entity138 and @entity120 , the move may not be doomed to failure as many suggest			2
but if life away from @entity64 does n’t appeal to the likes of @entity104 , @entity38 and @entity144 – leading to a break - up of the current squad – the venture is destined to fail			0
good news for @entity86 and @entity102 – @entity149 is back			1
the wrecking - ball centre has recovered from a persistent groin problem to start for the @entity86 in friday night 's @entity153 clash against @entity154 at @entity155			1
how the @entity157 club need him			0
with @entity149 in midfield , they won their first two games of the season			2
in his absence , they have lost three on the bounce			0
if @entity86 are beaten on friday night , it would be the first time in a decade they have lost four in a row , but @entity149 ’s timely return means @entity171 reverts to the wing and @entity173 is fit to resume at full back			1
@entity176 prop @entity175 has completed the long - haul trek from @entity178 to a place on the @entity86 ’ bench , six days after being at the vanguard of his country ’s historic victory over @entity184			1
@entity185 is missing again – which suggests that his knee injury is worse than first thought			0
meanwhile , @entity154 have recalled @entity189 at tighthead prop in an otherwise unchanged side			0
@entity149 will be hoping to steady the @entity86 ship as he makes his return from injury on friday night the backlash has begun			1
just four days after @entity198 ’s selfless heroics for @entity199 in the @entity200 , rugby league authorities in @entity184 have asked the club to explain why the @entity202 was allowed to play the whole game with a broken cheekbone and eye socket			1
at a time when concussion is a hot topic , acclaim for @entity198 ’s brave contribution to an epic triumph has been superseded by accusations that he should n’t have been allowed to keep taking so many punishing hits when he had already incurred significant damage			1
the 25 - year - old has had four metal plates inserted into his face and his cross-code move to @entity219 has been delayed by a month , at least , as he recovers from surgery			2
his staggering commitment last sunday served to whet union ’s appetite – beyond the confines of the @entity225 – for their next convert			2
@entity198 is a prodigious talent and a true warrior , but @entity219 and @entity102 must be prepared to occasionally save him from himself			2
@entity198 ( left ) played on with a broken cheekbone and eye socket for @entity199 in the @entity200 @entity231 ’s gravy train continues to rumble on in @entity232			1
the @entity234 ’ playmaker , @entity233 , is angling for a return to the @entity232 game – after a previous , injury - wrecked stint at @entity238 – and the asking price is thought to be @entity240 per year			2
that was the figure that @entity242 reportedly offered in a vain attempt to lure @entity244 from @entity245 , so the @entity248 club ’s owner , @entity246 , wo n’t want to miss out on another iconic southern hemisphere player to replace the departing @entity250			0
initial indications are that @entity245 wo n’t enter this particular auction , so @entity242 may have a clear run , as even most rich @entity232 clubs will baulk at an unprecedented seven - figure salary			0
@entity233 ’s fitness and playing powers may be in gradual decline , but he remains a stellar talent with commercial clout – the world ’s ultimate bums - on - seats signing			1
@entity233 is being linked with a big money move to @entity264 after next year 's @entity108 last word – the state of turmoil in @entity269 rugby is reaching critical levels			1
last weekend , the @entity184 became @entity176 ’s first victims in the @entity272 , as their scrum and discipline disintegrated			0
amid fears about a @entity279 player exodus , the outlook for @entity276 looks increasingly bleak as he faces an investigation over allegations of sending ‘ inappropriate and deeply offensive ’ texts about a member of @entity285 staff			0
meanwhile , @entity286 has released a book savaging the players who capitulated to the @entity289 last year , in his final match as national coach , and @entity244 has shown @entity184 what they are missing by earning the award for @entity294 in @entity232 ’s @entity296 league			0
all this comes against a backdrop of panic that the @entity285 could be insolvent next year , as revenues have slumped			0
trouble and strife @entity302 wo n’t elicit much sympathy in these parts , but it is not good for the game at large			0
the @entity184 are stumbling towards next year ’s @entity108 , but @entity308 opponents @entity102 and @entity309 should be wary of seeing them as easy prey			1
@entity276 has been suspended by @entity269 @entity231 over an allegation of deeply offensive text messages			0

@entity106 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 are all crying out for @entity153 rugby
@entity1 settled for a move to a the @entity50 , inside a rugby hotbed
@entity149 will make his @entity86 comeback on friday night
@entity198 ’s selfless heroics for @entity199 have *re-opened* the concussion debate after he played on with a fractured eye socket
@entity233 is seeking a big money move to @entity264 after the @entity108
