@entity0 claims he is still waiting for a ' proper crack ' at one - day international cricket			1
the big - hitting top - order batsman has nine @entity5 caps to date , since his debut against @entity7 last august			1
but after opening alongside @entity8 four times in that series defeat , @entity0 has played in only five of @entity5 's subsequent 18 matches - including at the @entity13 - and has batted instead at number three on three occasions			1
@entity0 is hoping for a ' proper crack ' at one - day international cricket with @entity5 the 26 - year - old is hoping for more continuity when @entity5 resume their odi schedule this summer			1
asked if he thinks he has had little of that so far , he told @entity22 : ' honestly , yes i do			0
' i do n't feel like i 've had a proper crack at it yet			1
' i played the back - end of last summer against @entity7 , did okay without setting the world alight - and since then , it has been the odd game , coming in , dropping out again			2
' @entity0 was his own critic , after making an encouraging 40 on debut in @entity30			2
since the series against @entity7 last august , @entity0 has played in only five of @entity5 's subsequent 18 matches he admitted back then , before his second innings , that @entity7 's seamers had limited his strokeplay , claiming : ' they were just very cunning			1
once i got past 30 , they were one step ahead of me			0
' so it 's up to me to put that right , and have that game smartness			0
' nonetheless , he takes issue with the theory that he has been ' worked out ' already at @entity44			0
he added : ' i read the press and saw the stuff about ' bringing the ball back in ' and that i had been worked out - i got bowled once by @entity48 with an inswinger			0
' that 's not being worked out - that 's a good delivery			0
' @entity52 big - hitter @entity0 was run out last sunday as his county battled to draw against @entity54 @entity55 was preferred at the top of the order , alongside @entity8 in the series defeat in @entity59 and then with @entity60 at the @entity13			1
' getting the news at the start of that @entity59 tour that i was n't going to get first crack dented my confidence quite a bit , ' said @entity0			2
' maybe i let it affect me in a negative way			0
' i am still learning my game , but i would definitely not say i have been " worked out "			0
