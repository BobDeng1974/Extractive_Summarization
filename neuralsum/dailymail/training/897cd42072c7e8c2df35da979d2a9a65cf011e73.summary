by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 20:02 est , 28 june 2012 after more than a decade hanging in a corridor , a never - before - seen picture of prince @entity2 has emerged on to the art market			1
the portrait by distinguished painter @entity6 is one of only three canvases of the @entity2 thought to be in existence			1
but what makes the picture so unique is that it is a study of @entity2 as a schoolboy and was painted when he was just 17			2
rare : the never - before - seen picture of the @entity16 - pictured here with his wife @entity18 - has made its way on to the art market it is for that reason that his old school @entity26 are keen to obtain the painting			2
if they are successful , they will need deep pockets — or a generous benefactor			2
this week , the picture was quietly put up for sale by @entity34 ’s , the @entity36 art dealers , with a price tag of £ 120,000			0
intriguingly , they are also selling another of @entity6 ’s portraits — this time of the @entity41 — for £ 20,000 less			1
the story of the 12in - by - 9in oil is fascinating			0
in 1999 , @entity44 began work on a vast canvas of four generations of the @entity48 to mark the @entity50 ’s 100th birthday			0
it featured the @entity50 , the @entity41 , prince @entity52 , prince @entity53 , prince @entity2 and prince @entity54			2
it was so large it had to be completed in five sections and fitted together , but it also involved a huge logistical operation			0
distinguished : the artist @entity6 in front of one of his other paintings of prince @entity2 potential buyer : @entity2 's old school @entity26 ( pictured ) is keen to obtain the painting - but they will need deep pockets each of the royals sat seven times for the artist but separately			1
@entity2 , who was in his final year at @entity26 , was painted in his housemaster ’s study			0
to complete the commission , @entity6 worked on drawings he had made in his studio at @entity76 , @entity77			1
it was from the drawings of @entity2 that the artist decided to make a separate painting			0
‘ i had no plans for it — it just hung in my “ royal corridor ” at my home , ’ @entity6 tells me			1
‘ no one knew i had done it			0
’ it might have remained there had not curators at @entity34 ’s come to look at some other work			0
‘ i think i was making them something to eat and they sneaked around to see what else i had got and saw the @entity2 picture and said they had to have it , ’ @entity6 says			1
its unique selling point is that it shows @entity2 in his @entity26 tailcoat			0
@entity6 recalls : ‘ i remember he turned up in some ghastly leopardskin waistcoat and i had to tell him to go and change			1
