that is the verdict of the documentary crew who traveled with eccentric sports legend @entity11 to the secretive communist nation in late february where he infamously declared himself a ' friend for life ' to the 29 - year - old despot as they bonded during a basketball game			1
indeed , the surreal trip was more bizarre than anyone could have first imagined - as details emerged of @entity11 serenading @entity1 with @entity22 's ' @entity21 ' at a dinner reception to mark the game but not before they had heard a female @entity2 pop band play the theme song to ' @entity27 ' on electric violins			1

incredibly , the crew had no idea it would meet the reclusive country 's young leader , @entity1 , until he showed up at a basketball game it was filming with @entity11 - which led to the unlikely bromance between the pair			1
the crew from @entity34 discovered that @entity1 loves basketball so much that he overlooked his government 's antipathy for vice founder @entity53 , who had made two critical documentaries on @entity2 , and personally invited the crew in			1
@entity53 was n't allowed back but @entity34 's @entity33 accompanied @entity11 and three members of the @entity39 traveling basketball troupe			2
asked yesterday about the meeting that forms the center point of their documentary , @entity33 said that @entity1 was ' socially awkward ' - but not as weird as @entity11 who does not once speak to the camera - even though @entity34 organized the entire trip			1
instead , he is only seen as a distant figure , wearing dark sunglasses and a baseball cap			0

i do n't like you and i do n't like your company , ' he said wednesday			0
the crew was told when it could turn on its cameras and when they had to be off , and feared landing in a @entity2 prison if it did n't comply , he said			0
the crew went through an elaborate week - long organized tour of @entity2 's capital of @entity32 , visiting a well - stocked mall with no other customers and the country 's version of @entity112			1
at one point , it was shown a classroom with students sitting behind computers , but only one person either knew how or was allowed to use one of the machines			0
one student sat before @entity123 's home page and never searched for anything , just moving the cursor back and forth randomly			0

@entity33 said the group was surprised when @entity1 arrived to watch what was essentially a pickup basketball game with the @entity39 and some members of a @entity2 youth team			2
@entity11 did n't play ; he sat in the stands watching with @entity1			2
after the game , the vice crew and players were rushed across @entity32 unexpectedly for a dinner with @entity1 and other members of the @entity2 government			2
@entity11 was only in the country for two days for the vice show but he and @entity1 got on so well that @entity11 was able to reveal stunning snippets of the dictator 's life			1
he said to journalists after he returned that @entity1 the ruler that @entity11 called a ' kid ' - has a young baby girl and that he heard @entity1 's wife talk all about her at length during his trip to the exiled regime			1

host and executive producer @entity53 attends the " vice " @entity196 at @entity197 on april 2 , 2013 in @entity198 the description that @entity11 is touting comes in direct contrast to the widespread understanding of the dictatorial leader and the military rogue state that constantly threatens nuclear war			0
' it was insane , they treat him like a god			0
but @entity1 is not one of these @entity210 - type characters that wants to take over the world , ' @entity11 told @entity212 ' his grandad built all this s * * t and then his dad built some more s * * t but he is a normal guy , ' @entity11 told @entity212 @entity11 revealed other details about the lavish trip , including the contents of the 15 - course banquet ( fish , noodles , and meat ) , the décor of the palace ( ‘ marble everywhere ’ ) and the height of @entity1 ’s wife , comrade @entity229 ( 5 ’ 5 ” which is ‘ quite tall for a @entity2 ’ )			1
the trip was apparently a major success , and @entity11 has already accepted a second invitation to visit @entity1 again for six days in august			2
although @entity11 was key to securing the visit and played the most prominent role of any of the visiting @entity6 , he 's only a bit player in @entity34 's documentary			0
@entity53 said @entity11 declined to be interviewed about the trip by vice afterward			0
the @entity6 group brought in some basketballs and basketball equipment to distribute to young @entity2 , but was n't asked for anything else by its hosts , @entity53 said			0
@entity34 has n't spoken to anyone in the @entity247 administration about the trip , he said			0
during the trip , the administration had refrained from commenting about it			0
@entity74 and @entity34 have not agreed to continue its series of news documentaries beyond this season , but the arrangement is likely			0
@entity74 said the show gets solid ratings , while @entity34 said the network gives vice valuable exposure beyond the young audience that traditionally follows its product .			0

the documentary crew that accompanied @entity11 to @entity2 over the winter says it had no idea it would meet the reclusive country 's young leader , @entity1
media company vice arranged the trip and invited @entity11 after its first choice , @entity273 , expressed no interest
they were *entertained* for two days by the reclusive dictator - who struck up an *unusual* friendship with @entity11
