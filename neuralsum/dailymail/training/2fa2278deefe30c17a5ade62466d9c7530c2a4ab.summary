by @entity1 reporter published : 10:28 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 13:13 est , 19 march 2014 accused : @entity3 says she underwent a sex change in 2000 to stop being violent a transgender woman accused of shooting dead three prostitutes in 1990 has blamed the killings on her violent male persona			1
@entity3 , 62 , appeared in court in @entity10 , @entity11 on tuesday - 24 years after she allegedly murdered the women and dumped their bodies on the banks of the @entity15			1
when @entity16 was arrested in connection with the crimes in 2012 , she claimed that she had transitioned into a female in 2000 to stop her male persona - @entity16 - from being violent			1
' @entity20 did n't stop , @entity3 stopped it , ' @entity16 told police about the killings , according to an affidavit filed in january			1
' i 'm not going to admit i killed anybody , i did n't			2
' when asked if @entity16 was responsible , she responded : ' i do n't know if @entity16 did or not , it was 20 years ago and i have no idea whether he did or did not , ' according to @entity30			1
in claims that experts say will only fuel misunderstandings about transgender people , @entity16 claimed she had the sex - change operation in @entity36 - which involves removing the testicles and therefore affecting testosterone production - ' as a permanent way to control violence '			1
she claimed when a person transitions from male to female , ' there 's a great downturn in violence ' - which experts deny			0
she is accused of killing @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , whom police say were prostitutes , and dumping their naked bodies on the river banks			1
according to the affidavit , detectives also interviewed a woman who had shared a cell with @entity16 during a stint in an @entity79 prison in 1998			2
she claimed that @entity16 said she had killed nine prostitutes ' because she could n't breed and the women had the ability to have children and they were wasting it being " pond scum "			2
' @entity16 is being held on $ 1 million bond in a @entity87 jail and initially refused to appear in court on monday			2
on tuesday , the judge issued a drag order and she was forced to appear , @entity66 reported			0
victim : @entity52 shot : @entity51 loss : @entity50 but experts have hit out at @entity16 's claim that her former identity was to blame , @entity30 reported			1
' for some people , it 's a metaphor : " i was a different person before i came out " , ' said dr. @entity98 , a @entity99 psychiatrist			0
' it 's a certain way that they use the metaphor when transitioning for those who were very unhappy before and now are happy			0
but it 's different when a person makes a claim that somehow they have no linkage to the person they used to be - that would be more of a disturbed presentation			0
' experts also say there is no evidence that hormone therapy in gender treatments helps reduce aggression or violence			0
scene : the women were shot and their naked bodies were dumped on the banks of the @entity15 mystery : the case was cold for more than two decades until @entity16 was linked to it through dna evidence @entity127 , a transgender professor of @entity129 and gender studies at @entity130 , said that @entity16 's publicized statements are a ' weak defense '			1
' even if we as a person are less aggressive once we resolved a gender disorder , it does not absolve the responsibility of killing three women , ' he said			0
' as a legal defense , putting away the science , it 's absolute nonsense			0
' he added : ' making being transgender into a motivating factor for murder is almost like the horror film , " dressed to kill "			0
it feeds directly into the horror stories about gender identity disorder			0

@entity3 is accused of killing @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity152 and dumping their naked bodies in @entity10 , @entity11
case fell cold for 20 years until dna from @entity16 , who had a long rap sheet , ' *matched* *samples* found at the crime scenes '
@entity16 told detectives she underwent a sex change operation in 2000 in order to stop the violence she committed as a man , @entity16
' @entity20 did n't stop it , @entity3 stopped it , ' she told detectives
