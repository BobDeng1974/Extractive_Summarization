though most of @entity1 's dates were positive , even though she says the first one with a 23 - year - old had a ' vague @entity88 sauciness about it ' she has admitted that some verged on dangerous , recalling one man who put his hands around her throat during sex			2

' i 've deleted all my online dating accounts now , ' she says ' i 've got something out of my system - it was just a reaction to my situation and not something you can do for very long , you have to move on			0
' there were some people who said " who 'd want to be with her now ? " but actually i have had lots of lovely messages from age - appropriate men , eligible men , who want to take me out so i do n't think i 'll have to go on a dating site again			2
