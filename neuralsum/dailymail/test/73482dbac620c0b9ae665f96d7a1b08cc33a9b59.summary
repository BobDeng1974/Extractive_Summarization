a mother - of - four calls herself the ' real life vampire ' as she has a rare medical condition that makes her allergic to the sun. @entity4 suffers from the rare disease erythropoietic protoporphyria which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight or uv light			1
a holiday abroad left the 42 - year - old in hospital for six days , as the heat caused her entire body to swell			1
her sun allergy means she has to keep herself completely covered , as even a small dose of sun on her skin leaves her in pain			1
in summer , everyday tasks like picking her children up from school or going to buy some milk become extremely difficult			2
@entity4 , 42 , calls herself the ' real life vampire ' as she has a rare medical condition meaning she is allergic to the sun miss @entity4 suffers from erythropoietic protoporphyria ( @entity7 ) which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight now , as temperatures in the @entity30 are set to soar , she is desperate for a drug that can help her			1
miss @entity4 , of @entity32 , said : ' it 's always worst when the sun first comes out because i have no time to adjust			1
' i have to pull the curtains closed and have to have a fan on , as any heat is painful			2
' she was first diagnosed with @entity7 , a rare blood condition which attacks the liver , when she was nine			1
the condition â€“ which is incurable - is caused by a build - up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood			1
as blood passes through the skin , the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues			1
the nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain , and it can also cause the tissues to swell up			1
for miss @entity4 , even tasks like going to the supermarket are painful , as uv light reflects up from the floor , burning her skin			1
@entity7 occurs when there is a build - up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood			1
the skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths ( @entity70 ) and to visible light			1
it is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem			2
as a result of this enzyme deficiency , protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood			0
as blood passes through the skin , the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues			2
the nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain , and if the blood vessels are affected , they can leak fluid , causing swelling			2
the condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling , itching and burning when exposed to sunlight			1
there is currently no cure			0
source : @entity102 ' from march to november i completely cover up when i 'm going to pick up the kids , ' she said			1
' when it 's boiling hot and i 'm wearing boots , jeans , a big cardigan , scarf and hat , i do get funny looks off the parents			0
' they think i 'm a bit strange			0
' i try and do normal things and not let it affect me			0
@entity119 , 18 , @entity120 14 , @entity121 , 12 and @entity122 , 10 , are understanding , but the family lives very close to the beach and so miss @entity4 feels guilty she can not join them when the weather is good			1
she said : ' it was difficult for them growing up			0
' when i was crying because i was in so much pain , they could n't even hold my hand			2
' the slightest touch puts me in agony			0
' ' they 're understanding , but the beach is just ten minutes away			0
i should be on the beach with the kids , but i ca n't			0
' i 'm just trying not to get sunned on			0
' even driving somewhere , my arm is in pain from the sun coming through the window			2
' i do n't know what i 'll do when it gets even hotter			0
' in june last year , miss @entity4 decided to take her children on a summer holiday to @entity147 , as she did n't want them to miss out on this right of passage			1
she bought special uv protection socks to block out sunlight , and booked an expensive apartment right near the pool			1
she hoped this would mean she could stay indoors if she needed , but could watch her children enjoy swimming			0
she found the only way she could enjoy the holiday was to stay indoors , emerging at night to go to the beach and explore the town in the dark			2
' we went in june because i thought it would be less hot , but how wrong i was , ' she said			0
last june , miss @entity4 went on a holiday to @entity147 but was hospitalised for six days afterwards , as the sun irritated her skin			1
she must wait until the sun sets before going to the beach near her home ( pictured ) miss @entity4 , pictured on holiday with her 10 - year - old son @entity122 , said her children are ' understanding ' but when she is crying in pain they are unable to hold her hand , as any touch puts her in agony ' even though i stayed in the shade , i ended up being covered up and in pain wherever i went			1
' i had to borrow a fan to sleep and spent most of the evenings in the toilets of the entertainment area putting cold water on my burning feet			0
' the kids would give me the ice from their drinks to put on my feet			0
' when they flew back a week later , her ordeal was n't over			0
she said : ' on the plane i cried , trying to sit there for four hours with the pain of the burns			1
' i had the air hostesses get me ice in the end			0
i was in such pain , i was crying and so upset			2
' i went through security and left the kids while i raced to get some cold water and some paper towels to try and ease the pain			2
miss @entity4 , pictured ( left to right ) with daughter @entity119 , 18 , @entity121 , 12 , @entity122 , 10 and @entity120 , 14 , is now fundraising for other sufferers of the disease five hours later , when the family landed in the @entity30 , miss @entity4 was admitted to hospital			1
she was kept in for six days as her liver was n't functioning properly ; the condition can cause liver damage in severe cases			1
now , she is running the @entity214 for @entity215 to help raise funds for other sufferers of the disease			0
she is hoping an experimental drug called @entity220 will bring hope for her and other sufferers			0
the drug acts as an anti-oxidant and activates melanin in skin , providing a barrier between the skin and wavelengths of light that trigger the burning and itching			2
' i 'll battle for this , ' she said			0
' i 've suffered for so long and been through so much			0
there needs to be treatment available			0
