with miss @entity2 standing next to him , @entity3 withdrew £ 300 , pocketing £ 270 whilst handing over the rest – so she could pay the fare			1
miss @entity2 , who was with her guide dog @entity32 , handed over £ 14 and gave him a £ 4 tip , to which he said ‘ are you sure ? ’ miss @entity2 ’s bank later contacted her about her balance and she was shocked to learn that £ 300 had been withdrawn			1
