@entity0 with cat , @entity2 , who got stuck up a tree for six days and fire crews refused to rescue her @entity6 refused to risk their safety by rescuing a cat that had been stuck in a tree for six days – so two young men stepped in to save the day			1

' while rescuing animals is an important part of our work , it can not be at the risk of our firefighter 's safety			0
' although the service can not condone members of the public putting themselves at risk we 're pleased the cat has been safely returned to its owner and that the young people involved were not injured whilst carrying out the rescue			0
' however , we must also be mindful of the fact that the rescuers may have put themselves at serious risk and , as we have seen in the past , would - be rescuers can become victims , sometimes with tragic consequences			0
