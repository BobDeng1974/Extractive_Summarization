a man who was brutally beaten and left for dead after witnessing his mother 's murder is still fighting for justice 36 years on - and says he knows who is responsible for her death			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was just four when a man entered the home he shared with his mother , 22 - year - old @entity11 , on march 25 , 1979 and savagely beat them with a blunt object - killing her and fracturing the little boy 's skull			1
a few weeks later , when he was finally well enough to speak with police , he named the attacker as @entity18 , his mother 's on - off boyfriend and a married father - of - four			1
even though prosecutors concluded @entity18 was not responsible for the attack , @entity6 continues to stand by his childhood claim , while neighbors have also recounted the couple 's troubled relationship			1
witness : @entity6 , pictured left , is calling for a new investigation into the 1979 murder of his mother , 22 - year - old @entity11 , right			1
he says he saw her boyfriend in their apartment before the attack ' this case is n't unsolved , it 's just unprosecuted , ' @entity6 , now 40 , told @entity38			2
@entity11 and @entity18 had met at the restaurant where @entity11 worked as a waitress and the night before her death , he was at her apartment , investigators told @entity38 's @entity44			1
@entity18 told police that he left late that night and then visited her apartment the following afternoon , where he came across her body			2
but family members told @entity38 's @entity44 that @entity18 had been possessive and abusive , and that @entity11 had been trying to break up with him at the time of her death			1
a neighbor , @entity51 , added to @entity38 that he often heard the couple fighting and the night she was killed , he heard @entity18 shout : ' you think you 're going to get away with this ? ' the following day , @entity18 barged into @entity51 's apartment and told the neighbor that @entity11 had killed herself , he said			1
when @entity51 rushed into the apartment with @entity18 , ' i immediately realized this was no suicide ' , he said			0
' he also noticed that her son was covered in blood on the ground but was opening his eyes			0
he picked up the boy 's limp body - all while @entity18 did nothing , @entity51 said			2
when @entity6 was well enough to speak to police , he named the man and picked his photo from a lineup			2
he told @entity38 that he had been sleeping when @entity18 walked in and switched on the light , giving him a good view of his mother 's killer			1
but a defense team today would raise issues with @entity6 's claims , considering his age , the passage of time and the injuries he sustained in the attack , experts told @entity38			0
questions : no one has ever been charged in the murder of @entity11 , left , or the attack on her son @entity6 , when he was four			1
her boyfriend was initially arrested but was freed after passing a lie detector test two months after the death , @entity18 was arrested and charged with his girlfriend 's murder , although he protested his innocence			1
his wife and children also stood by him			0
during a bond hearing , a neighbor testified that they saw @entity18 rushing away from the home around 3am on the night of the murder			2
he underwent two polygraph tests , both of which he failed			0
but there were questions over how the tests were carried out so police took him to @entity112 for a further test			0
after taking it , @entity18 went to the restroom and escaped police custody			2
the next day , after it emerged he had passed the third test , police spoke to him on the phone and convinced him to turn himself in			0
he was taken back to @entity8 where prosecutors dropped the charges - to the anger of police , @entity120 reported			1
despite the decision , @entity6 's father , @entity125 , said that his son maintained @entity18 ' sent my mommy to heaven '			1
in 1981 , the case was turned over to a countywide homicide investigation team after a grand jury decided the original probe was ' incomplete and one - sided '			0
the city later withdrew this decision			0
prosecutor @entity137 told @entity38 that there was no specific evidence indicating @entity18 was the killer			2
he suggested that the killing could have been motivated by a robbery or a sexual assault			0
testimony : neighbors said they often heard the young single mother , pictured with her son , arguing with her boyfriend , while one testified that he saw the boyfriend , @entity18 , near her apartment that night ' i was pretty well convinced he did n't commit the crime based on evidence at the scene , ' he said			1
' i did n't like the idea of charging someone on phony evidence			0
' police officers from the original case and members of @entity6 's family have since called for officials to reopen the case , and @entity165 prosecutor @entity164 said that he has met with @entity6 and has asked police to look for further leads			0
but right now there is no new evidence to bring charges , he said			0
after the attack , @entity6 , who was struck as many as 15 times with the blunt object , was left with partial paralysis on his right side and still has nine dimples on his head where his skull was fractured			1
he was raised by relatives and graduated high school			0
he still lives in the area with his dog			0
@entity18 refused to speak with @entity38 and his daughter told reporters to stop contacting them .			0
