by @entity1 reporter published : 08:02 est , 19 may 2013 updated : 09:59 est , 19 may 2013 @entity2 , the man allegedly behind calling @entity5 grassroots supporters ' swivel - eyed loons , ' has been a loyal presence at @entity8 's side for thirty years			1
yet he never gives interviews , has never stood for elected office , and is virtually unknown outside @entity11			0
but now , it is the sheer strength and longevity of @entity8 's friendship with @entity2 which makes the furore so damaging for the @entity5 leader because it is widely assumed their views are shared			1
centuries old : tennis partners : @entity8 ( back row , far right ) and @entity2 ( back row , 2nd left )			1
the pair first established their rapport as students at @entity28 , @entity29 , in the mid- 1980s and have remained extremely close since then the pair first established their rapport as students at @entity28 , @entity29 , in the mid- 1980s and have remained extremely close since then			1
profiles of the peer usually describe the 47 - year - old as either as ' mr @entity8 's tennis partner ' or ' the @entity36 's oldest political friend ' – fuelling critics ' claims that the government is being run by a socially elite clique of old ' chums '			1
the impression is enhanced by photos of them as young men , posing for the college tennis club team ( the pair are circled , left ) and standing next to each other at the summer ball , which they had helped to organise – lord @entity2 was chairman of the committee , while mr @entity8 booked the entertainment			1
critics : profiles of the peer usually describe him either as ' mr @entity8 's tennis partner ' or ' the @entity36 's oldest political friend ' – fuelling critics ' claims that the government is being run by a socially elite clique of old ' chums ' so who is who is @entity2 of @entity62 , and how has he become so close to the seat of power ? born into a well - off family , he went to @entity66 ’ @entity67 in @entity68 , where he won a place to study law at @entity29			1
it was at @entity28 , @entity29 , that he met @entity8			1
they organised a college may ball together and discovered they had a mutual love of racquet sports ( another similarity shared between tennis - playing @entity79 and @entity81 )			0
lord @entity2 urged @entity8 to run for the @entity5 leadership as the dark horse candidate when @entity84 announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 since those college days , the friendship has been cemented , with mr @entity8 describing @entity2 as ‘ one of my oldest and best friends ’			1
scandal : @entity2 's most serious brush with scandal came in 2008 when he was entangled with @entity93 in the ' yachtgate ' saga : both @entity2 and @entity95 were guests on billionaire @entity98 's yacht @entity99 like @entity8 , @entity2 got a @entity100 in his final exams ; then he took a job with management consultants @entity104 before , in 1991 , being called to the @entity105 and practising as a commercial barrister at one of the country ’s top chambers			1
his family owns @entity111 , a multinational textile company making ladies ’ clothes , and in 1995 , aged 29 , he joined the firm , drawing a salary of £ 900,000 in one year alone			1
it meant he was able to buy the £ 3million house in @entity118 , @entity119 , where he lives with his wife @entity120 and their three children round the corner from @entity8 ’s house in @entity125			1
@entity5 figures describe @entity2 as likeable , friendly , extremely bright and unassuming			1
he skis regularly , enjoys yoga , and owns another house in @entity129 , southern @entity130			0
it was @entity2 who not only urged mr @entity8 to run for the @entity5 leadership as the dark horse candidate when @entity84 announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 after the party ’s third successive general election defeat , but also masterminded his campaign			1
encouragement : @entity2 urged @entity8 to run for the @entity5 leadership as the dark horse candidate when @entity84 announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 lord @entity2 helped run mr @entity8 ’s bid with ruthless efficiency , calling in favours from his network of contacts in the business world and raising tens of thousands of pounds in the process			1
through his family clothing firm , @entity2 himself donated £ 10,000 to the successful cause			1
he was appointed deputy treasurer of the party in 2005 , and – ironically given the circumstances today – immediately let it be known that he wanted to end the dependency on major donors			0
‘ he ’s not comfortable with individuals giving large amounts			0
he wants a wider base of people giving smaller amounts , ’ said a party official at the time			0
but even before the @entity5 got into power , @entity2 made the wrong call			1
in 2007 , he was chairman of the @entity168 ’ club , a dining group for @entity5 donors who each gave a minimum £ 50,000 to party funds each year			1
they would have lunch or dinner in mr @entity8 ’s office in the @entity179 and meet senior @entity5 politicians			1
but this arrangement was in breach of @entity184 ’s rules , which do not allow party - political fundraising in the @entity186 , and mr @entity8 was forced to ‘ unreservedly apologise ’ after he was rebuked by the parliamentary commissioner for standards , sir @entity188			2
in 2008 , @entity2 was appointed chief executive of the @entity5 and was given specific responsibility for attracting party donors			2
until now , lord @entity2 's most serious brush with scandal came in 2008 when he was entangled with @entity93 in the ' yachtgate ' saga : both @entity2 and @entity95 were guests on billionaire @entity98 's yacht off @entity197 when mr @entity93 was accused of soliciting for a £ 50,000 donation to the party – at a time when @entity2 had been given responsibility for ' widening the party 's fundraising base '			2
donations from foreign nationals such as @entity98 are illegal and mr @entity93 insisted neither he nor @entity2 had discussed donations with the @entity207 , and the storm passed			0
in january lord @entity2 said ' i did not know who mr @entity98 was			0
i was going over because i had been invited , and it ’s a human weakness i ’m afraid because i was fascinated to see this boat			0
i had never seen a boat of that size close up			0
' rise : after the @entity215 entered @entity216 in 2010 , @entity2 was made co-chairman of the party and later in the year became @entity219 of @entity62 after the @entity215 entered @entity216 in 2010 , he was made co-chairman of the party and later in the year became @entity219 of @entity62			0
lord @entity2 's key party roles mean he will have been privy to some of the most closely guarded secrets of the ' @entity224 ' from the outset – no doubt reinforcing the prime minister 's feelings of personal loyalty			0
lord @entity2 's importance to mr @entity8 , who has publicly described him as ' one of my oldest and best friends ' , was emphasised when he was tasked with ' prepping ' the pm for his appearance at the @entity234 into press standards			1
he played the role of @entity237 , the counsel for the inquiry , by peppering mr @entity8 with likely questions about his relationship with newspaper owners			1
colleagues regard the peer as ' virtually indispensable ' to the prime minister			0
' he is direct , easy - going and has an extremely sharp business brain , ' says one			0
' plus , he is one of the few people around @entity8 who can talk to him on the same level			2
it would take a minor earthquake to shift him from his side			0
' in 2007 , @entity2 was chairman of the @entity254 , a dining group for @entity5 donors who each gave a minimum £ 50,000 to party funds each year - they would have lunch or dinner in mr @entity8 's office in the @entity262 @entity2 , one of the prime minister 's closest friends and political allies , was accused of making the ' swivel - eyed loons ' remark to journalists at a @entity119 hotel			1
they reported that an unnamed ' close ally ' of the prime minister blamed @entity5 activists for pressuring mps to take hardline stances on @entity276			2
they said he stated : ' there 's really no problem			0
the mps just have to do it because the [ @entity5 ] associations tell them to , and the associations are all mad , swivel - eyed loons			2
' but yesterday afternoon , after crisis talks with mr @entity8 , and amid growing claims on @entity287 that the unnamed person was @entity2 , the peer issued a statement , saying the allegations against him were ' completely untrue ' and he was considering legal action			2
' i did not , nor have ever , described our associations in this way or in any similar manner			0
nor do these alleged comments represent my view of our activists , ' he said			0
' on the contrary , i have found them to be hard - working , committed and reasonable people , the backbone of the party			0
' mr @entity8 fully backed @entity2			2
a no 10 spokesman said : ' the prime minister supports lord @entity2 's position			2
it is categorically untrue that anyone in @entity311 made the comments reported in the @entity313 and the @entity314			2
' both @entity313 and @entity314 stood by their reports			0
a source at @entity317 , which owns @entity313 , said : ' there is no doubt @entity2 used the words loons and swivel - eyed			0
' a titanic trial of strength between @entity323 and the two newspapers now seems inevitable			0
defeat for @entity2 would force him to resign and could inflict potentially catastrophic damage to mr @entity8 .			2
