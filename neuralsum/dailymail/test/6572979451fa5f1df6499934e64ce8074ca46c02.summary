they ’ve won seven on the spin in the @entity3 and made @entity4 look like relegation candidates as opposed to @entity7 rivals during saturday ’s first - half slaughter			1
so why are @entity9 destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top - four finish and not a serious title challenge ? finish second they may well , but never have they entered the race for the top - flight crown			1
this term they are simply the best of the ragged rest , each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a ‘ no contest ’			1
@entity9 celebrate after a fine strike from @entity26 put them 3 - 0 up against @entity4 on saturday this is the most impressive team the @entity28 have boasted since the dying embers of the @entity31 side of more than a decade ago			1
they have pace , power , energy and invention in attack – and that is just @entity26			2
at the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since @entity44			0
but their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them , again			0
this year , however , is a reverse of previous seasons			0
more recently we have built up @entity55 ’s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring , only for it all to fall flat			1
@entity55 watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top - four spot this time , it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress			1
by mid-october they had already dropped 13 points			1
there was talk of @entity55 not even seeing the season out , let alone extending his stay into next term and beyond			2
but is the long - serving @entity73 finally about to hit upon a team which , given the manner in which they ’re finishing this campaign , could well be installed as title favourites come august ? should @entity55 strengthen in key areas then they would surely be vying for such status at the head of the market			1
he needs no more @entity85 , no more @entity86 or @entity87			0
rather , he needs a new spine and characters with backbone			0
@entity91 celebrates his goal on saturday as the @entity95 @entity94 winner continued his fine form a central defender , central midfielder and centre forward need to arrive if this current vintage is to avoid going the same way as those who have promised so much yet delivered so little in recent years			1
interestingly , @entity55 ’s policy of chasing the best @entity105 talent could be on the way out			0
yes , there was the capture of @entity108 last summer , but that was more opportunistic than a long - term pursuit			2
@entity108 , in turn , has netted just four league goals and watched from the bench as @entity4 were torn apart			1
so , too , did @entity114			0
he has the mitigation of injury , of course , but does @entity55 trust him to remain fit for an entire campaign ? likewise , @entity119			0
teams which win titles have players who , in short , play			2
@entity119 ( centre ) watches on from the stands on saturday after missing out through injury @entity114 ( left ) has struggled since returning from a year - long injury lay - off @entity128 and @entity129 have both started just 17 of 31 league games			1
for the latter , a return of four goals is a sorry show given the 16 he plundered last season			2
so while there is the promise of better times ahead , issues remain for @entity55 to sort			0
you feel he is finally on the cusp of something exciting at the @entity144			0
but then we have been there before and it ultimately ends in the celebration of failure			0
@entity55 needs to think big this summer , or else goodwill from frustrated fans could be in short supply .			0

@entity9 moved up to second with 4 - 1 win over @entity4 on saturday
*gunners* are *bucking* their recent trend of ending the season badly
but they had already dropped 13 points in @entity3 by mid-october
signing a defender , midfielder and forward may make them title favourites
