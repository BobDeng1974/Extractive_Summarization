when archaeologists claimed to have found the bones of @entity2 amid the ruins of an ancient @entity5 monastery experts were understandably sceptical			1
but carbon dating tests carried out at @entity7 have provided scientific evidence to support the extraordinary claim			1
a knucklebone has been dated to the @entity11 - a time when the revered @entity13 prophet is believed to have lived			1
the remains of @entity2 ? clockwise from top left , the knucklebone , the ulna , part of cranial bone and molar ( together ) , and a rib find : an excavation on the island of @entity25 resulted in the discovery of human bones in a sarcophagus researchers were said to be ' surprised ' when they discovered the very early age of the remains , but admit ' dating evidence alone can not prove the bones to be of @entity2 '			1
the new dating evidence will be revealed in a tv documentary to be shown on the @entity36 on sunday			2
the remains - small fragments of a skull , bones from a jaw and an arm , and a tooth - were discovered two years ago embedded in an altar in the ruins of the ancient monastery , on an island in the @entity47			1
they were kept inside a reliquary - a container for holy relics - on @entity25 - which translates into @entity53 as @entity55 - off @entity54 on @entity5 ’s southern coast			1
find : the new dating evidence will be revealed in a tv documentary to be shown on the @entity36 on sunday the knucklebone has been dated to the @entity11 - a time when the revered @entity13 prophet is believed to have lived			1
the ‘ key ’ clue to the relics ’ origins was a tiny sandstone box found alongside the reliquary with a @entity66 inscription : ' @entity67 , save your servant @entity69			2
' the date is believed to be @entity2 ’s birthday			1
one theory is that the person referred to as @entity69 had been given the task of bringing the relics to the island			0
@entity7 professors @entity77 and @entity79 attempted to radiocarbon date four of the human bones , but only one of them could be dated successfully			1
professor @entity77 said : ‘ we were surprised when the radiocarbon dating produced this very early age			0
we had suspected that the bones may have been more recent than this , perhaps from the third or fourth centuries			2
‘ however , the result from the metacarpal hand bone is clearly consistent with someone who lived in the early first century @entity93			0
whether that person is @entity2 is a question that we can not yet definitely answer and probably never will			1
dna tests at the @entity97 on three bones confirmed they were from the same person and probably from someone of @entity102 origin - where @entity2 came from			1
they also established they were probably from a man			1
dr @entity106 , who carried out the research , said : ‘ of course , this does not prove that these were the remains of @entity2 but nor does it refute that theory			1
’ dig : archaeologists and students work at the site on @entity114 , @entity5 the bones were found amid the ruins of an ancient monastery @entity2 was the son of @entity119 , a priest of the @entity121 in @entity122 , and @entity123 - who was related to the @entity124			1
he lived as a hermit in the desert of @entity127 until about a.d. 27			0
when he was thirty , he began to preach on the banks of the @entity129 against the evils of the times and called men to penance and baptism ' for the @entity135 is close at hand '			0
@entity55 anticipated a messianic figure who would be greater than himself and , in the @entity140 , @entity137 is the one whose coming @entity55 foretold			0
when @entity141 came to him , @entity55 baptised him , saying : ' it is i who need baptism from you "			0
when @entity141 left to preach in @entity146 , @entity55 continued preaching in the @entity129 valley			0
fearful of his great power with the people , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity146 , had him arrested and imprisoned at @entity153 on the @entity154 after @entity55 denounced his adultrous and incestuous marriage with @entity156 , wife of his half brother @entity158			0
@entity55 was beheaded at the request of @entity160 , daughter of @entity156 , who asked for his head at the instigation of her mother			0
@entity55 is presented in the @entity140 as the last of the @entity168 prophets			0
source : @entity170 one theory is that the person referred to as @entity69 in the inscription was given the task of bringing the relics to the island monastery			0
@entity5 researchers believe that the bones probably came to @entity5 via @entity179 , an ancient @entity180 city , where the right hand of @entity55 was kept until the tenth century			2
many countries around the @entity183 claim to have remains of @entity55 , including @entity180 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
according to the bible he was the cousin of @entity137 and a revered holy man who baptised the son of @entity67			2
he is said to have foretold the coming of @entity141 before being beheaded on the orders of @entity194 , with his head served up on a plate			0
in a separate study , another @entity7 researcher dr @entity197 has used historical documents to show that in the latter part of the fourth century , monks had taken relics of @entity2 out of @entity122 and these included portions of skull			1
these relics were soon summoned to @entity206 by the @entity207 who built a church to house them there			0
further research by dr @entity197 suggests that the reliquary used to contain them may have resembled the sarcophagus - shaped casket discovered at @entity25			2
archaeological and written records suggest that these reliquaries were first developed and used at @entity206 by the city ’s ruling elite at around the time that the relics of @entity2 are said to have arrived there			1
the marble sarcophagus , which contained a collection of human and animal bones , was found directly beneath the church altar proof ? the reliquary box thought to have been used to carry the bones to the island			2
the exterior has inscriptions written in ancient @entity66 mentioning @entity2 and his feast day dr @entity197 said : ' my research suggests that during the fifth or early sixth century , the monastery of @entity25 may well have received a significant portion of @entity2 ’s relics , as well as a prestige reliquary in the shape of a sarcophagus , from a member of @entity206 ’s elite			1
' this gift could have been to dedicate or rededicate the church and the monastery to @entity55 , which the patron or patrons may have supported financially			0
' the scientific analysis of the relics undertaken by @entity251 and @entity79 at @entity7 , and their colleagues in @entity253 was supported by the @entity254			0
the documentary @entity255 , featuring the scientists ' work is due to be shown on the @entity36 at 8pm on 17 june 2012			0
resting place ? the island of @entity25 - which translates as @entity55 - lies just off the @entity260			2

dna tests on three bones confirmed they were probably from someone of @entity102 origin - where @entity2 came from
they also established they were likely to be from a man
