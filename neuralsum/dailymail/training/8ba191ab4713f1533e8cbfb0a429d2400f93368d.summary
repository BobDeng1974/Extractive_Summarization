on trial : reverend @entity2 , 54 , claimed he married large numbers of illegal immigrants because he feared they would ' live in sin ' , court told a vicar who ran an alleged sham wedding racket was ‘ fast - tracked ’ because the @entity9 wanted more black clergy , a court heard yesterday			1
reverend @entity2 did not have training in the law surrounding marriages when he was appointed as a parish priest , his trial was told			1
but officials thought he brought ‘ a bit of colour to proceedings ’ in the @entity9 , a senior clergyman said			1
@entity2 , 55 , is accused of presiding over a ‘ matrimonial conveyor belt ’ , where migrants from outside the @entity22 are said to have married those with the right to remain in @entity25 before applying to the @entity26 to stay here themselves			1
the prosecution alleges that the plot was ‘ an industrial - scale abuse of the system of immigration control within the @entity25 ’ but lawyers for @entity31 questioned if he had been made a ‘ scapegoat ’ for a wider problem			1
@entity2 started working at @entity37 ’s in @entity38 , @entity39 , in 2002 and became the parish vicar in 2007			0
the former @entity41 of @entity42 , @entity43 , said vicars normally served a form of apprenticeship but that @entity2 had not done so because he previously worked in a cathedral in @entity48			0
he said @entity2 ’s lack of experience meant he struggled with rules and paperwork but added : ‘ because we were trying to appoint more black and @entity58 clergy , the bishop said it was something that we needed to take account of			1
’ he said : ‘ one of his great benefits was that he was not @entity9 background … whereas we are considered quite grey and dull , he brought a bit of colour to proceedings , which changed things ... for the better			1
’ he told the court @entity68 , who came to the church from @entity48 in 2002 , had difficulties sticking to the laws in @entity73			1
' having been trained abroad , @entity2 did not have a sure grasp of the rules of the @entity9 and how it applied to a @entity77 , ; he said			1
he said he challenged @entity68 during a visit to the church in 2007 about the number of marriages happening there , and questioned whether the correct procedures were being carried out			1
@entity84 said : ' @entity31 's reply to me was " what i 'm trying to achieve is so no - one feels they are not living outside the law of @entity90 and church , by living together without being married "			1
' he told me living in his country without being married was considered sinful , so he wanted to get as many people married as possible			0
' i said it was very commendable but it must be carried out by the law of @entity73 , not law of @entity48			1
i reminded him of his duties as a registrar and he could be sent to prison if he did not observe the law			1
' it is true the clergy are not immigration officers , but the priest must make every effort to ensure marriage is lawful and the procedures are observed so the marriage is not void			0
not taking care of procedures means all sorts of problems can occur			2
' women were seen queuing out of the door at @entity37 's and @entity117 's in @entity38 , south @entity39 , pictured , while other brides got changed in the garden , the court heard he said he had been to the church in 2004 to check the records and found @entity2 was not filling them out correctly , in that he was filling out one copy of the register instead of the two he was meant to			2
he said : ' i spent three days going through the records with him , showing him how to fill them out correctly			0
' he introduced me to his registrar , @entity129 , and i told him she could not be the registrar because he could not delegate the registrar 's duties			1
' but apart from the hiccup with the registrar he seemed to be doing a very fine job			2
' he called @entity68 a ' good friend ' and said he was a very ' spiritual and dynamic person ' , adding : ' he was a good man and the @entity136 had confidence in him			0
' he added : ' the increase in baptisms was proportional to the increase in weddings and the increase in the congregation			2
it became a very thriving church			2
' when a church grows exponentially some administrative errors occur			2
we say get the marriage law right and we can help with other matters			2
' witnesses : @entity155 @entity154 said @entity156 told him ' living together without being married was sinful ' while former church warden @entity157 said weddings went from ' 5 weddings a year to 10 a week ' @entity84 said the @entity160 and other dioceses in @entity39 had been plagued by a rise in sham marriages , leading to the @entity41 and @entity136 writing letters to warn all the priests in the diocese of the correct procedures			1
he said : ' the practice of sham marriages was not widespread , but it happened			2
' there was a wedding between a @entity171 and a @entity173 woman of easy virtue at another church , which was stopped			2
there were gangs of people roaming around doing this			0
' when prompted by @entity2 's defence lawyer @entity180 , @entity84 remembered @entity2 had come to him with concerns about eight marriages that he considered could be sham			2
he said : ' it led me to believe he was following the rules because he was bringing important things to my attention			2
' @entity157 , who has been a member of the church since 1939 and had acted as church warden and vice chairman of the @entity192 council , also gave evidence			1
he described @entity2 as a man of ' integrity and principle ' but said he favoured @entity48 and @entity48 customs at the expense of his other parishioners			0
he also remarked on the number of marriages happening in the community and his surprise at their ' remarkable increase '			0
ringleader : @entity68 is accused of pocketing £ 70,000 and sending huge sums back to his native @entity48 mr @entity157 said ' @entity2 came to the church in 2002 , he had new ideas in the running of the church			1
' in the early days he asked me to be a mentor to remind me about how things used to be in the church			0
we worked very closely together until he started to go his own way , this disintegrated slightly			0
' when he arrived at the church we got on splendidly , he called me ' @entity220 '			0
we were good friends , but this tended to change when his way of doing things moved away from what i was used to			0
' the number of marriages went from four or five weddings a year to 10 a week , there were two a day some days			1
' when @entity2 was introduced to the church he said he would support the @entity48 population over here			0
most of the people being married were not members of our church , they were strangers to us			0
i did n't recognise any of the brides or grooms and did not see them again			0
' i had the job of reading out the banns in church			0
they were difficult to read			0
i had problems pronouncing some of the names which gave quite a bit of amusement			1
' the number of marriages in the church and other changes in procedure meant he was elected to send a letter in 2009 to the bishop , saying they were worried about the way things were being done in the church			0
mr @entity157 said : ' it was a result of old members of church feeling something was not quite right			1
we mentioned the large number of weddings and the fact the accounts had not been produced for three years			0
' the pastoral care suffered , the problem was so much time was taken up by weddings that he did n't get round to the rest of his duties as he should have done			1
' however , he said the population of the church itself had doubled in the time , which could have led to an increase in the number of marriages			0
he added : ' in one year we had the biggest number of confirmations in the country , 57			0
' seven defendants deny a total of 51 charges relating to immigration offences			1

officials thought @entity292 brought ' a bit of colour to proceedings '

@entity155 claims @entity301 had problems sticking to rules
' i reminded him of his duties as a registrar and he could be sent to prison if he did not observe the law ' , @entity154 said
