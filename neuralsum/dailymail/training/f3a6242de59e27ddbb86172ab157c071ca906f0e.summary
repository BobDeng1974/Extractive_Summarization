@entity0 is acutely aware the last two years have seen him pictured more frequently perusing the shops of @entity2 alongside his famous girlfriend than on the pitch			1
he hopes his move to @entity6 will redress that balance , beginning with sunday 's trip to @entity9			1
@entity0 is bursting to remind people of his talent , of those performances for @entity13 that earned him an £ 8million move to @entity15 in 2012			1
his career at the @entity17 , on wages of £ 50,000 per week , never got going and reached a nadir when he was forced to train alone as his team - mates competed for points in matches			2
new signing @entity0 poses with his new @entity6 shirt following his arrival from @entity15 @entity6 could make @entity0 's loan deal permanent at the end of the season @entity0 claims his best is yet to come following his arrival at @entity6 from @entity15 as the profile of his long - term partner @entity32 rocketed through her appearance on ‘ @entity34 ! ’ , @entity0 was left looking like a forgotten footballer			1
a loan to @entity37 last season was undermined by a three - month hamstring injury and managerial upheaval , meaning he has not completed 90 minutes of a @entity42 match since may 2012			1
he sees this move to @entity44 — where he has a clause in his contract that allows him to pull out of a permanent £ 2.5m summer transfer if they are relegated this season — as key in kick - starting his career			1
he said : ‘ at @entity15 , i would be on my own with another coach and just going through drills			1
it has been very difficult			2
it has tested me mentally as a football player			2
hopefully now there is light at the end of the tunnel and i can leave that behind me			2
@entity6 new boy @entity0 is greeted by @entity59 at the club 's training ground at @entity62 @entity59 and @entity0 share a joke as @entity0 seals a move away from @entity15 @entity0 had started to become overshadowed by his long - term partner @entity32 ‘ it defines you as a person how much you want to play football			1
that ’s why i ’m here now			2
i want to show everyone — and most of all i want to prove to myself — that it ’s not just about the money			0
i want to be back out there			0
‘ what i ’ve done on the pitch has n’t left me			0
the only thing is form			0
because i have n’t played for so long maybe it ’s going to take me a few games			0
’ he smiles when it is suggested he might want to wrestle back the column inches from @entity32 , the former @entity82 actress , but acknowledges his presence in the sports pages will provide a gauge of his success			0
‘ we have a baby on the way and she is not too fussed about being in the public eye at this moment in time			2
i want to be on back pages , ’ he said			0
‘ she is due in june			0
that is another reason why i want to be settled and know where i am going			0
i have to focus and want to stay here at @entity6			1
‘ people who do n’t know me think , “ @entity100 , @entity0 , he has a celebrity girlfriend , he has money and he does n’t care about football ”			1
i know that ’s not true			0
i still have the love of the game and want to be out there and starting to prove myself			0

@entity0 *struggled* to impress during his time at @entity15
he has *joined* @entity6 on loan until the rest of the season
@entity6 will have *opportunity* to sign @entity0 on permanent deal in summer
