by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 02:56 est , 5 march 2013 twisted , snapped and buckled , a once sinuous strip of black tarmac has been contorted into the most unimaginable shapes and structures			2
deep cracks criss - cross the road next to perilous cliffs where the right of way has shifted vertically below where cars once drove safely along a main road in @entity12			1
amazingly , the abandoned half - mile long section of road has become one of the county ’s busiest tourist routes as cyclists , walkers and off - road bikers are being drawn to explore the challenges of the disused road			1
mountain bikers playground : the tarmac on the former @entity26 road in @entity12 now looks more like an adventure track for performing bike jumps and tricks sheer drop : father @entity31 , 43 , gets close to the edge of the twisted road , pictured left , while his son @entity34 , five , takes in the stunning scenery , pictured right the @entity26 was closed to traffic in 1979 after road repairers eventually gave up a losing battle against a landslide that has slowly been moving down a hillside for thousands of years			1
looking like they have been randomly sketched on the road surface , many of the road ’s original white lines , now point in haphazard directions separated by deep fissures in the tarmac			2
mountain - biker @entity31 , 43 , who was riding the road with his son today , said : ' it ’s an amazing place to ride – it ’s got some really challenging sections and jumps			1
' although it ’s not just mountain bikers that are using it – i ’ve seen a couple of road bikes , loads of walkers and a couple of motorbikes up here today too			1
' some people are using this as a route to link up other trails and paths and others are just coming up here to experience the broken road			2
' daring : @entity31 jumps off a nine foot tarmac cliff on the @entity26 in @entity12 , which has slowly been destroyed by a landslide moving down a hillside for thousands of years lying below @entity78 , the road was built in 1819 linking @entity79 and @entity80 in the @entity81			1
also known locally as ‘ @entity83 ’ , the new section bypassed the steeper @entity85 route and crossed the ancient @entity78 landslip			0
as a result of further movement , major road works were required in 1912 , 1933 , 1946 , 1952 and 1966			2
in 1974 large parts of the @entity78 section collapsed during a massive landslip			0
more road works were carried out but the force of millions of tons of rock pushing the road further downhill could not be stopped and eventually the road was abandoned to @entity99 now have to use @entity100 pass again as another route around the narrow pass has not been built			0
@entity103 , 5 , rides on the road in the @entity81 that was closed to traffic in 1979 the ' old @entity26 ' has now become a favourite spot for ramblers and cyclists , especially off - road bikers geological research suggests the @entity78 landslide happened 3500 to 4000 years ago and the average downward movement of the landslide is about 25 centimetres per year but this movement increases considerably during a very wet winter following a significantly wet summer			1
the landslide is about 1000 metres long , the top is about 300 metres across and the spread increases at the bottom to about 450 metres			0
maximum thickness of the landslide is about 40 metres			0
at a rough estimate the landslide contains about 15 million cubic metres of slipping debris weighing in the region of 45 million tonnes			0
the speed of the landslide appears to be increasing			0
professor of @entity129 , @entity130 , warned : ' since 1880 the lower arm of the highway has moved over 40 metres downhill			0
' before : the @entity26 pictured when it was still open in 1976 - and already showing several uneven patches after : a @entity136 image showing a recent view of the road which has been closed to traffic since 1979 the @entity141 academic monitors the landslide with probes buried near the old road added : ' the amount of sliding over the winter months is about one meter in the centre of the slide , with a local anomaly of high slip near the upper car park – which we keep a close eye on because it is likely to become more unstable with time			1
' it seems likely that the present - day relatively rapid rates of movement in the @entity78 slide are related to higher winter ground - water levels in recent centuries than for much of the time since the landslide first formed			2
' on the @entity163 website a post warns : ' i would n’t be at all surprised if we woke up one day and found the whole lot down in the bottom ' .			0

the @entity26 was closed to traffic in 1979 because of a slow - moving landslide
half - mile stretch of torn up and twisted road is now *unrecognisable*
the site in @entity12 has become *popular* with walkers and cyclists
