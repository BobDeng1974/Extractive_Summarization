@entity0 lit up the new - look @entity1 with a stunning 195 as @entity2 bossed day one of their first test with @entity5			1
the @entity2 captain made sure the first day day of international cricket at the redeveloped @entity8 would be remembered as he raced to his score off 134 balls as part of a team total of 429 for seven			2
there were many highlights , but perhaps his stand of 153 for the fifth wicket with @entity17 was the best , the pair scoring at 7.84 an over while together			0
@entity0 hit a superb 195 off just 134 balls to propel his @entity2 side to 429 - 7 on day one @entity0 was at his aggressive best , smashing the bowlers to all parts as the @entity2 took control @entity17 would make 85 from 80 and @entity24 a more considered 54 from 98 as @entity5 toiled			1
they had looked on song at one point , though , reducing the hosts to 60 for two and 80 for three , but after that it went downhill			0
there were some teething problems for the venue , with both opening bowlers losing their footing , but they were quickly amended			0
@entity34 went first for 18 , cleaned up by @entity35 , with @entity36 then holing out to point for 27			0
the @entity2 captain reached his century off just 74 balls , the fastest in a test by a @entity41 @entity5 had the early edge when @entity34 's off stump was expertly removed by @entity35 @entity44 appeals for a decision as @entity5 looked to get on top during the first session @entity48 followed for seven , run out attempting a quick single , but that brought @entity0 to the crease and he set about causing chaos			1
@entity24 made a watchful 54 in his company before he was bowled by @entity54 , but by this point all eyes were on @entity0			1
treating the occasion like a @entity59 game , he broke his own 78 - ball @entity2 record for a fastest century in tests by four balls and continued to swing from the hips			2
coming in with his side in a spot of bother at 88 - 3 @entity0 took back the momentum with a blistering knock the @entity2 captain salutes the crowd after finally being dismissed five runs short of a double century @entity17 did the same at the other end , with the pair both shelled by @entity73			1
@entity0 was on course for the quickest double hundred in @entity62 - having gone to 200 in his last outing too - when he holed out to long off when facing @entity77 , with his stand including 18 fours and 11 sixes			0
@entity81 came out and added 26 before going to @entity82 , with @entity17 then removed by the visiting captain for 85 , with @entity73 finally taking one .			0

@entity2 close day on 429 - 7 after *dominating* day one of @entity62
