by @entity0 last updated at 8:36 pm on 28th february 2012 a @entity2 photographer was smuggled out of the besieged @entity4 city of @entity5 on a stretcher in a 26 - hour operation that is reported to have seen a dozen volunteers killed			1
the extraordinary escape of wounded @entity11 cameraman and film - maker @entity12 into @entity13 along a 20 - mile smuggling route came despite the continued withering bombardment of @entity5			1
but it emerged that three other journalists , including the badly injured @entity19 correspondent @entity18 , had been separated from the 47 - year - old @entity20 by the intensity of @entity23 fire and forced to turn back			1
wounded : @entity2 photojournalist @entity12 has been smuggled out of the besieged @entity4 city of @entity5 this evening @entity19 president @entity25 said 31 - year - old @entity18 , who works for @entity26 , had been officially evacuated after ' tough negotiations			1
' he gave no details but said she was suffering from ' multiple fractures			0
' news of the dramatic escape came as the total death toll in @entity4 climbed past 7,500 , according to @entity35 estimates			1
the @entity35 has reports that ' the death toll now often exceeds 100 civilians a day , including women and children			0
' mr @entity12 , a former soldier and father - of - three , was said to be in ' good shape and good spirits ' as he received treatment in @entity43 for three leg wounds sustained last week during the shelling of a makeshift press centre in @entity5 that killed veteran correspondent @entity47 and @entity19 photographer @entity48			1
speaking at the family home in @entity51 , @entity52 , mr @entity12 's wife , @entity49 , confirmed the release , adding : ' all i can say is that we are delighted and overjoyed at the news			1
' appeal : @entity58 , the mother of journalist @entity47 , who was killed in @entity4 last week , today made an emotional appeal ' begging ' for help as she told how she could not rest ' with my daughter 's remains in that country ' his father @entity65 described his son as being in ' very good spirits , ' adding : ' we 're all very relieved and happy that @entity12 's out			1
' after several frustrated attempts to rescue the injured and recover the two bodies , mr @entity12 and his colleagues had taken the decision to try and escape with the help of @entity4 volunteers during a respite in the shelling of @entity5 on sunday night			1
they chose instead to take their chances along the precarious smuggling route which had successfully taken 40 wounded @entity4 out of the country to neighbouring @entity13 in the previous six days			1
the route , which is in nightly use to ferry in medical supplies and food and to extract the wounded from @entity5 , was established 10 months ago by @entity4 activists with the help of @entity89 , the human rights campaign group			1
' that night all four decided to go for it , ' the @entity89 spokesman in @entity43 said , ' they wanted to go together			0
so the activists that we co-ordinate got them all to the exit place from the actual neighbourhood where they had been waiting			0
' from that point the operation went wrong			0
three activists were killed , and @entity12 was the only one to get out			2
the others got split up , and we believe that they turned back to @entity5			0
' leg injuries : @entity19 photojournalist @entity18 was also wounded in the deadly bombardment last week			1
her whereabouts are today unclear tragic : ms @entity47 ( left ) died alongside @entity19 photojournalist @entity48 ( right ) @entity108 chaired a meeting of the government ’s @entity110 ( @entity110 ) today which focused on how to increase the political and economic pressure on the @entity115 regime			1
although @entity4 has been discussed at previously meetings of the @entity110 , it was the first to be devoted exclusively to the escalating crisis in the @entity120 country			1
it was attended by senior ministers as well as the chief of defence staff general sir @entity123 , said the prime minister ’s spokesman			0
further @entity110 meetings are expected in the coming weeks			2
asked if military options , such as the supply of weapons to rebels , were also discussed , the spokesman said : ‘ the focus of our efforts is on how we can bring further political and economic pressure to bear			0
’ he added : ‘ the purpose of the meeting was to take stock of the situation			0
clearly there is a very challenging situation in @entity4			2
‘ the prime minister believes that there is a moral imperative for the international community to do more to stop the violence and support a political solution in @entity4			2
‘ they were discussing different economic and political options to bring pressure on the regime			0
’ the possibility of seeking a @entity155 resolution narrowly focused on humanitarian issues in the hope of gaining the support of @entity159 and @entity160 , who refused to back a resolution condemning the violence , was ‘ one option we would be considering ’ , said the spokesman			0
however he stressed that there was as yet no international consensus on any of the issues surrounding @entity4			2
amid great secrecy , mr @entity12 continued with his helpers towards the border			2
' the route is very complex because they are dodging the @entity4 army , minefields and a huge military base , ' the spokesman explained			2
' they get to one position , they talk to each other very quickly by satellite phone , decide whether it 's safe , then move again			2
' they were shelled again and more of our activists were killed			0
we do n't know exactly how many but we think about 10			0
@entity12 went into hiding again and we finally got him out after 26 hours from start to finish			1
' there is no news on whether the bodies of ms @entity47 or @entity48 had been moved from @entity5 but her mother , @entity58 made an emotional appeal today ' begging ' for help as she told how she could not rest ' with my daughter 's remains in that country '			1
speaking on the @entity202 , she said she would not accept the award winning correspondent being buried in @entity4 , insisting : ' no , i ca n't accept that ... i want my daughter back			1
' sometime , somehow we will bring her home			0
i ca n't rest myself , i ca n't have peace in my life with my daughter 's remains in that country			1
i think that mothers listening to me would feel the same way and understand how a mother feels			0
' anyone who can help in any way , i would just beg them to do it			0
' she added : ' i 'm going to miss her			0
i did n't want her to be the cause or the reason but i do wish that her death does mean something and that perhaps it would help to end some of these terrible , terrible things that are happening			0
' meanwhile today @entity227 secretary of state @entity226 said @entity4 president @entity115 could be tried for war crimes , but has admitted pursuing charges against him could make it more difficult to persuade him to give up power			2
@entity233 president @entity232 said he is ready to offer asylum to @entity4 's leader @entity115 and senior figures in his regime as part of a negotiated solution to end the @entity4 conflict			1
@entity233 would be a surprising choice for @entity115 's retirement as it was the first @entity242 nation to topple a longtime autocrat when its former president fled the country a year ago in the face of protests			0
during a stormy meeting today , the @entity250 meeting in @entity251 called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire			0
@entity35 human rights chief @entity254 said she had received reports that ' massive campaigns of arrests ' by @entity4 troops against rebels had deprived many civilians of food , water and medical supplies			2
@entity4 's representative to the @entity35 , @entity264 , stormed out of the session , accusing countries of " inciting sectarianism and providing arms "			1
smoke rising from shelling in the @entity5 neighbourhood in the city of @entity5 @entity5 was said to have come under some of its heaviest bombardment yet , with the government sending in units of an elite armoured division into rebel - held districts			0
the @entity4 government appears to have stepped up its offensive against rebels across the country this week - sending forces into several towns in northern @entity4 for the first time			1
up to 144 people died in @entity4 on monday , many of them in a single incident at a checkpoint in @entity5 , the opposition said			2
