by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity1 have hailed the ‘ x factor ’ of @entity9 after his recall to the squad for next week ’s first test against @entity6 at @entity7			1
the @entity11 all - rounder was the lone shining light to emerge from the disastrous 5 - 0 whitewash in @entity15 during the winter , scoring a century at @entity17 and grabbing six wickets in @entity19			1
but he missed the @entity21 in @entity22 and the recent series against @entity24 after fracturing a wrist punching a dressing - room locker in frustration during @entity1 ’s tour of the @entity29 in march			1
with @entity74 cricket looking for an instant pick - up following the unexpected 1 - 0 defeat by @entity24 , national selector @entity72 said of @entity9 : ‘ he ’s a vivacious character , he ’s got some x factor and he ’s fantastic on flat wickets			1
‘ he gets movement off the ball and the pitch and we ’re really encouraged by @entity9			1
’ @entity9 could bat as low as no 8 and , with @entity72 insisting that the new - ball pairing of @entity50 and @entity56 are ‘ 100 per cent fit ’ , he is likely to replace @entity59 all - rounder @entity58 in the starting @entity85 , as well as leapfrog @entity55 ’s @entity65			1
it is a move that would lend depth to the batting and the seam bowling , which is sure to be stretched to its limits in an exhausting schedule			2
@entity72 said : ‘ we have five tests in a very short space of time and one of the reasons to include six seamers is that we believe at some stage they ’re all going to play			2
‘ we would like to think the four who get picked on the day play brilliantly and stay fit and the world ’s perfect but realistically we need a group			2
’ potential : @entity9 was one of very few bright spots in @entity1 's unsuccessful @entity36 winter @entity58 had his moments against @entity24 and is one for the future , but his five test wickets have cost 54 apiece			1
@entity72 also had words of support for @entity45 , whose leadership skills came under fire from , among others , @entity113 and @entity114 following his display in the field on the fourth day of the @entity117			0
‘ we believe , given he is a person of integrity and has scored so many runs , that he will turn it around and help us to be successful , ’ said @entity72			0
‘ he is creating a very good environment and culture with @entity126 that enables guys coming into the team to succeed			0
there ’s proof in the performances from @entity62 , @entity48 , @entity52 , @entity64 and @entity60			0
once we start winning it will be the icing on the cake			0
‘ ever since @entity133 stood down we knew we had to rebalance the team , look at different options			0
@entity48 will help the spin department and so will @entity64			0
it ’s a different way of balancing the team			0
regret : @entity9 thinks he has to be more mature and says ' i do n't think punching lockers is the way forward ' ‘ it might be difficult for the public to get used to but we ’ve got three or four youngish spinners operating in country cricket who we , as selectors , feel are not quite ready yet			1
we have faith in @entity152 and think he ’ll perform well			0
’ meanwhile , @entity6 ’s preparations for wednesday ’s first test in @entity155 were boosted by a classy innings of 81 from their no 3 @entity157 in the three - day game against @entity159			2
when @entity1 and @entity6 last met in a test series at the end of 2012 , @entity157 scored 382 runs before he was dismissed			1
he provided a reminder of his adhesive qualities against an inexperienced @entity159 attack after the tourists had slipped to 18 for two			0
openers @entity167 and @entity169 were both dismissed for six before @entity170 — @entity172 ’s heir at @entity173 — was bowled for 36 by @entity174 , a 20 - year - old seamer from @entity175 making his first - team debut			1
@entity6 captain @entity177 then bashed a quick 46 before he was bowled on the charge against left - arm spinner @entity179			2
@entity157 promptly retired out on 81 .			0

@entity9 back in @entity1 fold after being recalled in a 13 - man squad
the *23* - year - old all - rounder was not selected to face @entity24 *due* to a self - inflicted wrist injury
@entity9 broke a bone in his hand when he punched a dressing - room locker
@entity9 was one of few to emerge with credit from @entity36 horror show
