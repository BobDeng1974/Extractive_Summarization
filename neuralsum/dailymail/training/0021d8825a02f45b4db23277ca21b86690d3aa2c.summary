but the hosts stunned @entity3 five minutes after the restart with @entity9 heading in a pinpoint @entity32 cross			1
as expected it turned out to be a one - sided second half with @entity3 attacking and the @entity110 waiting to hit back on the break			0
@entity3 substitute @entity85 shook the crossbar with his first touch of the ball before @entity48 sealed @entity0 's win when he tapped in from a @entity62 assist in the 88th minute			2
