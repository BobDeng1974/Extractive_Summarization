by @entity0 it is the time of year when most of us are dreaming of getting away from the cold weather and the hum drum of being back in the office			0
for conscientious pet owners though the thought of a beloved furry companion suffering in a cold concrete kennel while they live the high life is reason enough not to book that trip			2
a new hotel could be the answer : the @entity17 is an upmarket retreat designed exclusively for pet dogs aiming to offer them a relaxing holiday while their owners are away			1

@entity23 is struggling to keep up with demand for the luxury accommodation and has even been asked if owners can stay , too			0
she said : ‘ i have always looked after dogs for friends and have always had my own dogs here			0
‘ but the idea for the @entity17 started after a friend told me their dog always seemed so happy after a stay at our house , and we realised it could be a business			2
‘ i had wanted to set up a business i could run from home and we had room to accommodate dogs so it seemed ideal			0
