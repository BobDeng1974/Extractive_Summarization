it was love at first sight for @entity27 and @entity28 , from @entity29 , @entity30 who have now taken @entity4 home - weeks before rescue centre staff believed the dog would be re-homed			1

when i took him on a few weeks ago he was so frightened and biting me - it was fear aggression			0
the neglected dog , pictured with @entity28 , has been given a new lease of life with his new family ' but he seems to adore these people and their children			1
he 's gone from a mess of a dog and a shell of himself to a really confident , bouncy thing			2
' accountant @entity27 , 43 , said @entity4 settled right in with the family and even sits at the front window waiting to welcome new people to the house			1
' he 's a little daddy 's boy			2
he seemed to take to us straight away			0
he was all over me			0
' i 'm thrilled we could give him a new home , especially after what he had been through			2
he 's very happy a settled with us			0
' he still seems very puppy like			0
the children love playing ball with him - he just wants attention and to be loved			0

he then had to be sedated to allow them to put a jacket over his tiny body to keep him warm			0
@entity4 the @entity5 arrived at a dog rescue centre in @entity108 , @entity13 , with fur so matted vets spent five hours shaving two kilograms of it off @entity4 's condition was so dire when he arrived at the centre , owner @entity35 was reduced to tears rescuer @entity35 said she had been reduced to tears by his condition			1
' his coat was so covered in petrol , she said , a drink of water may have poisoned him if any fur had got in his mouth , ' she said			1
' he came into our rescue from a member of the public			0
his fur was very , very long and matted like felt and all his legs were like tree trunks with chemical smelling fur			2
' it looked like he was thick with oil , fuel or petrol			2
he really , really stank			0
when @entity4 arrived at the centre , his previous owner could not touch him , said mrs @entity35			0
petrol and oil that was staining his coat meant the dog , who had never been groomed , gave off a strong stench after spending time recovering at the centre , @entity4 has overcome his fear of interaction with humans , and plays happily with the other dogs in its care ' cases like this keep me awake at night and in tears - we are not trained to handle the emotional strain of taking in rescue dogs			1

' she handed him over on a lead because she would n't even touch him			0
it is clear he has never been groomed			0
' ' it 's wonderful to see him so happy again , ' she added			0
