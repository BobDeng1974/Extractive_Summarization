by @entity0 police who arrested a suspected schoolgirl psychopath on suspicion that she cut off the head of a friend discovered that the alleged killer had been practising by cutting off animal 's heads			2
the 16 - year - old schoolgirl had even told her father and stepmother that she planned to kill someone after getting bored of torturing animals , yet when her desperate parents tried to raise the alarm they were told there was no room for any more patients in the psychiatric hospital , and advised them to call back again in a week			1
the schoolgirl , not named for legal reasons , had also attacked her father with a baseball bat before allegedly attacking and severing the head of fellow student @entity25 , 15 , in the western @entity27 city of @entity28			0

he had re-married about three months ago , after the girl 's mother died of cancer last year , and is believed to have given cash to his daughter so that she could get by on her own after he failed to get her admitted to a psychiatric institution			0
the rejection was made despite the fact that she had told her parents that she " wanted to dissect someone "			0

the murder comes just 10 years after @entity28 was rocked by a primary school girl being stabbed to death by a classmate a day before the incident , her parents consulted with a psychiatrist and tried to get the girl hospitalised but the request was turned down due to lack of space at the facility			0
the father then called a local child welfare office , but a security guard told him to telephone back after the weekend			0
but before he could do that , the murder had been carried out			0
after the alarm had been raised , police who went to the high school girl 's apartment in @entity28 , 900 miles south west of @entity109 , found the bedroom soaked in blood , with the decapitated body of her friend lying on the bed			2

police alleged that the suspect struck @entity25 on the back of the head more than 10 times with a blunt instrument and while she was unconscious strangled her			2
then as a final act , it is alleged , the suspect cut off @entity25 's head and her left hand with a large knife			1
the horrific crime came to light after @entity25 's parents contacted police to say their daughter had not returned home			1
police said @entity25 had earlier sent a message to her parents to say she was going to visit her friend at her apartment - then later sent her parents a text at around 7pm to say she was about to leave for home			2
