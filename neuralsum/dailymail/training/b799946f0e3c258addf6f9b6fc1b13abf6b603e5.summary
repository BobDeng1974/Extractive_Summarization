mr @entity17 , 32 , had rushed back from work after ms @entity9 sent him frantic text messages about the damaged pipe , saying : ‘ the electrics were sparking ’			2
a court heard the supermarket worker ’s death was caused by a catalogue of blunders by ' negligent ' electricians who worked on the ' inadequate ' boiler			0
the block of one and two bedroom flats had been built less than two years earlier in 2006 and a company called @entity44 and @entity45 were responsible for all the insulations in the building			0
electrician 's mate @entity48 carried out electrical insulation tests in the flat where miss @entity9 lived on march 8 , 2006			2
ms @entity9 's mother , @entity51 , right , has said she is ' very disappointed ' by @entity7 's £ 1,000 fine the work at ms @entity9 's flat on @entity27 , @entity28 was approved the year before her fatal accident @entity48 , 52 , who worked for @entity55 , said the circuits were safe and also signed a document to say he had exercised reasonable care			1

passing sentence , judge @entity70 explained law set out he could only fix an amount the defendant could afford to pay within 12 months , which is why it ' may seem light '			0
ms @entity9 's family say they have been unable to grieve during the six years it has taken for the case to come to court flowers left at the building , which was built less than two years before the tragic death in 2007 the judge told @entity7 : ' you have been convicted of a grave breach of duty			1
' the testing of electrical circuits is absolutely vital			0
you were responsible for the failures in checking paperwork			0
' because of your failures and those of others who created this situation , you failed to detect a metal stud frame behind a plaster board at the house was live for a period of some 18 months			2
' there was a leak in the boiler , the water soaked the carpet and that too became live and led to the inevitable death of @entity9			2
' i accept there are a number of other individuals who are as culpable as you			0
' the court heard that during the construction of the flat a screw used to attach plasterboard to the metal frame in the wall in the store cupboard penetrated a cable causing it to become live			1
as a result of the blunder , when miss @entity9 ’s boiler leaked , the puddle of water in her store cupboard crept under the skirting board and touched the frame - meaning it was also live			1

@entity9 , 22 , was electrocuted and died when her kitchen flooded in 2007
blunders in the wiring of the flat meant a metal frame in her wall was live

he was found guilty of breaching the @entity16
he was given a £ 1,000 fine for his role in the death - the *maximum* sentence
victim 's mother , @entity51 , hits out , branding the sentence ' a joke '
