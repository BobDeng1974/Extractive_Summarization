too much sugar may be bad for the waistline , but it could help doctors heal the sick			2
new research shows folk medicine from @entity5 may hold the key to treating wounds that defy modern medicine			1
a study found granulated sugar poured directly into bed sores , leg ulcers and even amputations promotes healing when antibiotics and other treatments have failed			1
according to the study , sugar draws water from the wound into a dressing accelerating the healing process			1
the traditional remedy was suggested by @entity23 ( left ) for treating @entity24 ( right ) the study is headed by @entity23 , a senior lecturer in adult nursing at @entity27 , who grew up in @entity28 where his father used sugar to heal wounds and reduce pain when he was a child			1
@entity33 draws water from the wound into a dressing - bacteria needs water to survive - which allows accelerates the healing process , or kick starts it where progress has stalled			1
when mr @entity23 moved to the @entity43 he realised that sugar was not recognised as a traditional medicine that had something to offer			1
one of the patients receiving treatment as part of the research is @entity24 , from @entity51 , who was being treated at @entity53 ’s amputee rehabilitation ward			2
he underwent an above the knee amputation on his right leg due to an ulcer at the @entity57 ( @entity58 ) @entity51 in january 2013 , and as part of the surgery a vein was removed from his left leg			2
for his post-surgery rehabilitation , mr @entity24 was moved to @entity53 where standard dressings were used but the left leg cavity wound was not healing effectively			1
nurses contacted mr @entity23 and mr @entity24 was given the sugar treatment and within two weeks the wound had drastically reduced in size			1
mr @entity24 , a 62 - year - old electrical engineer , said : ‘ it has been revolutionary			2
the actual wound was very deep - it was almost as big as my finger ‘ when @entity23 first did the dressing he almost used the whole pot of sugar , but two weeks later he only needed to use 4 or 5 teaspoons			1
a @entity43 amputee had an open wound healed with the novel sugar treatment			1
@entity24 , from @entity51 , had his right leg amputated above the knee , and one of his veins removed after developing a huge ulcer			2
however , the resulting wound refused to heal , until a nursing lecturer suggested a sugar treatment used in his native @entity28			1
@entity23 applied a whole pot of sugar at first , but was down to five teaspoons two weeks later			2
he said it works by drawing water away from the wound , as water is needed for bacteria to multiply			1
now the electrical engineer is on the road to recovery at the @entity53 , @entity51			2
mr @entity24 , 62 , said : ' it has made me feel so much better and i 'm not in pain anymore			0
' it 's three weeks later and the wound has really come together			1
' mr @entity23 is now halfway through his randomised control trial at three @entity104 hospitals - @entity53 , the @entity105 and @entity106 in @entity107			0
so far 35 patients have successfully received the treatment , with no adverse effects reported			0
mr @entity23 , 47 , said : ' i 'm so pleased with the results and the reaction my treatment is receiving			0
" when i was a child my father used to treat my cuts with sugar , so i was to surprised to find that did n't exist here in the @entity43			0
' ‘ i am very pleased indeed			0
i feel that it has speeded up my recovery a lot , and it has been a positive step forward			0
' i was a little sceptical at first but once i saw the sugar in operation and how much it was drawing the wound out , i was impressed			1
’ staff nurse @entity126 said : ‘ one of the main benefits has been the morale of the patient			0
he could see the cavity in his leg as well as having been unwell and through operations			0
‘ but the sugar has given something to hold on to			1
it is amazing that something as simple as sugar has given him a morale boost - the psychological benefit is up there with the physical benefits			0
' the patient is ecstatic with the results			0
’ mr @entity23 is undertaking a trial at three @entity104 hospitals - @entity53 , the @entity147 and @entity106 in @entity107 - into using the sugar paste			0
so far 35 patients receiving treatment have seen their condition improve , with no adverse effects reported , compared with 16 patients who did not have the treatment			0
the treatment works because bacteria need water to grow , so applying sugar to a wound draws the water away and starves the bacteria of water			1
this prevents the bacteria from multiplying and they die			0
mr @entity23 said pure sugar was used which had to go through infection control procedures			0
he said ‘ in @entity5 we would get the sugar from the supermarket , here it has to go through our aseptic services department			1
‘ the only problem we have is asking people to be prepared not to get the treatment - they have already been on standard treatment of antibiotics and modern dressings which has n’t worked			2
’ mr @entity23 , who has won an innovation award for his research , said : ‘ it is very pleasing for me to see the results , especially now that the nurses are able to take over and administer the treatment after i have made the initial assessment , and also that the patients are experiencing the benefits			0
‘ i believe in the sugar and the nurses and doctors who see the effects are beginning to believe in it too			0
i ’d like to thank the @entity27 and the @entity190 for their support and also the patients for taking part			0
