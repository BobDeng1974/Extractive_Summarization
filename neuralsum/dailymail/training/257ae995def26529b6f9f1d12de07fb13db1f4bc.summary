by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 05:11 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 05:26 est , 26 february 2013 @entity2 are facing the prospect of playing a home @entity5 tie behind closed doors after @entity8 charged their supporters with offences of a racist nature for the fourth time this season			1
@entity16 football 's governing body confirmed today they have charged the @entity18 club for the ' racist behaviour ' of their fans during last thursday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity22 as well as the ' throwing of missiles and or fireworks ' and ' insufficient organisation '			1
@entity2 fans were found guilty of similar racist offences in the home and away ties against @entity29 and the game with @entity31			1
punishment : @entity2 could be forced to play their next @entity5 game behind closed doors following the game in @entity35 , @entity8 suspended a sanction of playing a @entity5 tie behind closed doors for a probationary period of two years			1
that could now be imposed when @entity8 's @entity41 meet tomorrow and could mean the @entity42 is empty when @entity2 host @entity44 on march 14 in the second leg of their last - 16 tie			0
@entity48 also face a charge after their fans lit fireworks in the stadium as @entity2 advanced 5 - 3 on aggregate following a 3 - 3 draw in the first leg			1
the build - up to the match was overshadowed by trouble with 8,000 @entity60 fans having descended on @entity18			0
three monchengladbach fans were stabbed in confrontations although none of the injuries were serious			0
trouble : @entity2 fans have been charged with ' racist behaviour ' for the fourth time this season ( this a a file photo - there is no suggestion that fans in this picture are responsible ) @entity2 president @entity72 was dismayed by the latest outbreak of violence although he felt it was unfair to blame the club			2
he told @entity77 : ' i would urge the media not to label the protagonists of all these incidents as ' @entity2 fans '			2
@entity18 is a metropolis and as such is inhabited also by bad people			0
' for example , there is no suggestion so far that those behind these incidents were part of @entity2 's organised fan groups			2
' nobody is trying to justify this behaviour , but i say this because i am in constant contact with the police and want to understand if these people really are linked with @entity2			0
' in my view they should do a quick trial and send them to prison for some time , so they do n't have the chance to do it again			0
