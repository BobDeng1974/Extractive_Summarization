by @entity0 one look at @entity2 told you that a life of splendour and a world of riches is still no protection from the turmoil caused by affairs of the heart			1
here was @entity2 with all the privileges stripped away , just another 25 - year - old struggling like so many with true love and all that it means			1
during his short press conference at @entity16 on wednesday , he answered one question with the distant look of a man with his mind placed firmly somewhere else			1
there was one awful moment during another when he looked like he might lose it completely			2
in the balance : @entity2 's split from fiancee @entity27 has threatened his chances in the @entity29 happy couple : @entity2 proposed to tennis player @entity27 in december going steady : the pair had been an item for over two years down : the pair ( pictured last week ) only sent out invitations to their wedding at the weekend this was @entity2 as we have not seen him , wrought and strung - out			1
a man who did not appear in any fit mental state to make a decent fist of playing in the @entity42 ’s flagship event , the @entity43 which , lest we forget , begins on thursday			2
who knows the reason for the break - up , which comes only a few days after the wedding invitations were sent out			0
less than a month ago , @entity27 was talking of starting a family and @entity2 was tweeting a photo of their scenic location for dinner only last friday			1
let us hope there really is nothing more to it than the official explanation of cold feet			0
but the news certainly caught everyone cold on the practice ground			0
‘ i ’m surprised , i think we all must be , ’ said @entity63			1
typical @entity2 , to front up and answer questions when things have gone wrong			1
what he must surely be asking himself , though , is why things are always going off @entity68 was one more twist to the legend : ‘ it always seems to happen to @entity2			1
’ one of these days he will have a season where all the talk is about golf but it does n’t look as if it will be any time soon			2
@entity74 to see you : @entity2 is offered words of wisdom from television legend sir @entity78 in awe : @entity80 played alongside @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 hero status : @entity2 was distracted by @entity82 , who won the @entity85 with @entity86 in 1999 gobsmacked : @entity83 won five @entity88 titles during a successful stay at @entity90 gift : @entity81 presented @entity2 with a @entity86 shirt which appeared to brighten his mood the main man : @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity81 watch on @entity2 takes a shot this time last year the break - up in question was with his manager , @entity101			1
the year before that he made the startling confession that he had taken his eye off the ball			0
‘ i ’ve spent enough time with lawyers this year to last me a lifetime , ’ he said wistfully last november			0
now , as we head into the meat of the season with this prestigious event followed by three majors in as many months before the @entity114 in september , here we go again			0
fifteen months ago , @entity115 got to play with @entity2 when his mind was whirling so much he walked off the course at the @entity118 after nine holes			1
on thursday afternoon , the great @entity120 will get another close - up of a distracted @entity2 as they have been drawn together in the first round			1
how on earth can you play with such a huge obstacle between you and thinking clearly ? the only thing @entity2 ’s got going for him today is that he has had plenty of practice , although perhaps nothing quite so distracting as this			1
‘ i ’m not going to lie , i think it is going to be very difficult , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ when i get inside the ropes i ’m just going to try to concentrate on the shot at hand but that ’s easier said than done			0
’ fatherly advice : @entity2 speaks to his @entity138 , @entity139 ahead of the @entity29 at @entity16 @entity140 was so cut up after he was dumped by @entity142 ’s daughter @entity141 that eventually he took some time away from the game			1
‘ i ’ll definitely be putting an arm around @entity2 ’s shoulder and asking if he wants to talk about it , ’ said the @entity145			2
‘ i ’ve been through it from both sides			0
i split up with @entity152 but @entity141 was the one who left me			0
it should be easier if it ’s mutual but when it is a really painful break - up the temptation to throw yourself into golf more than ever does n’t always work out			0
every case is different but for me i had to stop playing for a while			0
’ right now , @entity2 is determined to plough on			2
in eight strokeplay tournaments this year , he has finished outside the top 10 only once but now that consistent spell of form has to be set against yet another off - course complication			0
a friend in need : @entity140 will offer @entity2 someone to talk to if he needs @entity63 said : ‘ obviously i wish both of them the best but i ’m guessing this is going to be very distracting for @entity2			1
we know how hard this game is when you have a clear mind , and i ca n’t imagine what ’s going through his head now			0
’ @entity2 stepped back into the public spotlight on wednesday with three former @entity86 footballers for company , in the shape of @entity83 , @entity82 and @entity81			1
a lifelong @entity86 fan , he must have been thinking a week ago that this was a pro-am round he could really savour , rather than a chore			0
now there was a rueful grin as he shook hands with each in turn			0
his dad @entity189 was there beside the first tee as well , offering moral support			0
this time last year the build - up to this tournament was overshadowed by an ill - advised remark from @entity140 about @entity197 , made at an awards dinner designed to celebrate the winning of the @entity114			1
now it is affairs of the heart that have taken the place of matters of race			0
it is such a shame			0
just like last year , a heck of a golf tournament is bursting to break out on thursday			1
this is the 60th anniversary of the @entity29 and the biggest one yet , with record crowds expected to descend on this beautiful corner of @entity213 to greet virtually everyone who is anyone in the @entity216 game			2
let us hope it emerges			0
but , right now , @entity2 ’s bombshell is the only topic in town			2
all change then : @entity2 posted this tweet just last week which did n't indicate any problems since meeting in july 2011 , @entity2 and @entity27 have had their fair share of career ups and downs ... 2011 : @entity228 at the @entity229 , leaves his management team and finishes the year ranked @entity231 3			1
@entity27 - loses to @entity232 in @entity233 semi-final and ends the year as @entity231 1 for the second time			1
2012 : @entity2 - wins the @entity229 , the @entity114 , tops the @entity216 and @entity237 money lists and is @entity231 1			2
@entity27 - makes @entity239 quarter - final but loses in the first round at @entity241 and the @entity233			2
2013 : @entity245 a $ 155m @entity243 deal but loses form , quits the @entity118 mid-round and drops to @entity231 6			0
@entity27 - fails to make it past the fourth round in any of the @entity249 , but maintains her top 10 ranking			2
2014 : mcilroy - starts with seven top 10 finishes but drops to @entity231 11 in april , his lowest ranking in three years			0
@entity27 - a change of racket and injuries see her struggling for form and drop out of the world 's top 10 .			2

@entity2 looked affected by the split from his fiancee @entity27
latest distraction after split from manager @entity101 last year
talks of desire to focus on golf but may not be able to do that
offered support by fellow golfers @entity63 and @entity140
