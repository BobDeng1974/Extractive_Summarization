by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 13:26 est , 5 march 2014 a former contractor to @entity4 security services has built his own nuclear fusion reactor in the basement of his home			1
engineer @entity8 was once a ' @entity9 bandit ' - a term for private companies located in or near @entity12 that provide services to the government - making signal processing and radio gadgets			1
now he lives in a remote area of @entity18 and works as a gunsmith , posting his creations in his engineering forum online			0
he has created the reactor by hand , using components from other gadgets			2
mr @entity8 , who has been chronicled in a documentary by @entity43 , said : ' i learned to do electrical engineering from parts scavenged from dumpsters from behind the tv store			2
i had to learn to design things with what i had			0
' ' we started with parts designed to do something else			0
this is one of our cooling fans , it came out of a computer system			0
' many scientists believe nuclear fusion is one of the most promising options for generating large amounts of carbon - free energy in the future			1
@entity8 is a former ' @entity65 ' , producing technology for the intelligence community mr @entity8 is a gunsmith by trade			1
right , a sign in mr @entity8 's ' box full of creative chaos ' fusion is the process that heats the @entity74 and all other stars , where atomic nuclei collide together and release energy			1
fusion scientists and engineers are developing the technology to use this process in tomorrow 's power stations , but so far there is no viable model			2
he said : ' this has the power to replace all the electricity companies on the planet , all of the gasoline companies on the planet			0
' the @entity93 of fusion is to make this into a viable power source			1
' @entity8 is a champion of sharing information , using his forum to share technological secrets with a like - minded community he lives in a remote area of @entity18 and works as a gunsmith he laughs off concerns about radiation leaks			1
' there 's a lot of seconds were we get no radiation , ' he said			0
' this is actually one of the most radiation - quiet places on this planet			0
' this is what i do for fun and giggles			0
' @entity8 is also a champion of sharing information , using his forum to share technological secrets with a like - minded community , including how to build guns and make ammunition .			2

@entity8 has used components from other machines to create reactor
he calls nuclear fusion the ' @entity93 ' of safe , clean , *abundant* energy
the gunsmith says it could put world 's energy companies out of business
