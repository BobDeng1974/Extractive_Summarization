by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's like tearing down a child 's hopes and dreams			0
@entity6 and @entity7 , from @entity8 , in @entity10 's western suburbs , have been ordered by their local council to remove the @entity14 cubby house they built for their three children			1
the order from @entity18 follows complaints that had been made by their neighbours claiming the cubby blocked their views and compromised their privacy			1
mr and mrs @entity27 started to built the elaborate tree house in their backyard in mid 2013 and have been in a dispute with neighbours and council since october			1
it started out as a simple @entity14 project to encourage their three children @entity38 , 7 , @entity39 , 5 , and @entity40 , 2 , to play outdoors rather than watch television or play video games			0
this was only made clear to them after the neighbours complained			0
' what people are forgetting to mention is that there is a four - metre lane way between the two properties , ' mrs @entity27 told the today show on thursday morning			0
the neighbour 's property faces the back of the @entity27 cubby and a laneway			1
mr @entity7 added a roof , railings and swings to add some safety to the kids play area			2
@entity79 , @entity80 told @entity81 he was sympathetic to the @entity82 , but council has an obligation to act when it received complaints			0
the cubby house that has caused an uproar in the neighbourhood in @entity89 , @entity90 ' my attitude to a lot of those things is that people should be able to do what they want in their own backyards without much interference from council , unless it does have some adverse impact on surrounding properties , ' he said			1
' living space for the kids outside where they can play is a good thing , but if it adversely affects the neighbours then they are entitled to an opinion as well			0
' ' in the beginning it was more than one complaint , but we spoke to the neighbour and while she was n't happy at first she was so moved by the children 's love of their cubby house that she came around , ' mrs @entity27 told @entity1			1
' it 's funny now that the only person complaining does n't even have a house on the block of land behind the cubby , his house would just be overlooking a laneway not just our yard and cubby			2
' in the meantime , ms @entity27 said she is hopeful an amended plan may give the tree house a last - minute reprieve			2
mr @entity7 started out building the cubby from old wooden pallets and slowly added to the structure his kids love the railings were added for safety but may need to be removed in order to comply with council @entity141 has told the family that they may approve the new plans if they remove the railings and other parts of the cubby which were added for the children 's safety			1
on the today show , @entity38 , the oldest @entity27 boy told @entity149 , ' if they tore it down it would be horrible because all of my friends who come over love it and i love it			0
' although the family is passionate about fighting the dispute , they do not want it to affect their relationship with their neighbours			0
' we tried to do the neighbourly thing and went around to chat to all out neighbours before we knew who made the complaints , because we care so much about our neighbourhood , ' said mrs @entity27			1
' at the end of the day if it has to come down , it has to come down			0
we just hope council will reconsider the amended plans , ' said mr @entity7			2
the family will find out the outcome of their retrospective proposal on tuesday			0
mr @entity7 family will find out on tuesday whether or not they need to tear down their cubby house			1

@entity141 has ordered the removal of a backyard cubby house after receiving complaints
the cubby was built without council approval
@entity6 and @entity7 built the play house to promote outdoor play with their young children
the @entity27 's neighbours are claiming the structure is obstructing their views and *disrupting* their privacy
the @entity27 's are hoping to *overturn* council 's *decision* to tear the cubby down
