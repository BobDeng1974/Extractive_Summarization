' the hopes and dreams of @entity3 fans were left in ruins after @entity101 upset the odds by beating @entity103 1 - 0			2
in their worst performance in the tournament since 1958 - losses to @entity103 and @entity106 in their first two fixtures mean they will be leaving @entity110 before the knockout stages			0
