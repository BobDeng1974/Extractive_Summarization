@entity1 's investigation into alleged racial , sexist and homophobic messages sent by @entity3 and @entity4 shocked football to it 's very core on wednesday night			1
here 's how those involved in the game reacted ... @entity10 - @entity9 manager you can be lost in this game very quickly			1
you can take years to build up your reputation – there ’s lots of top - quality managers of my era that very rarely get an opportunity now			1
reputation : @entity9 boss @entity10 says lots of managers from his era rarely get any opportunities now investigation : @entity3 ( right ) and @entity4 have been accused of being racist , sexist and homophobicin a series of text messages dating back to their time together at @entity31 @entity32 - chairman , @entity33 these revelations are further confirmation of how football is tainted with racism , sexism , homophobia and anti-semitism , and the culture which continues to exist throughout the game			1
@entity42 - former @entity31 player no one knows what happens behind the scenes in football clubs			0
at the time when you ’re a young pro , no one will listen			0
people would listen to the manager not me so i chose to keep my mouth shut			2
@entity56 caretaker manager @entity4 was brought in to recruit players , and the chairman will look at that			1
each day something ’s unfolded , something ’s come out , it ’s been difficult			0
i had a chat with the players about staying focused			1
difficult : @entity66 caretaker manager @entity65 has told his @entity66 players they must remain focused @entity69 - chairman of the @entity70 ’ trust the @entity68 condemns without reservation any racist , homophobic and sexist comments whenever and wherever they are made			1
the gay football supporters ’ network the @entity75 is saddened to hear reports of alleged homophobic comments			2
homophobia is still a problem in football			0
we will be following the story closely and asking the @entity83 to fully investigate the allegations			2
@entity86 @entity85 and @entity88 striker @entity90 statement			1
* * * * * * * disgraceful			2
institutional acceptance of the ‘ banter ’ of casual racism			0
disgraceful : former @entity85 and @entity88 striker @entity94 was unhappy with the @entity90 statement women in football we ’re gravely concerned by recent revelations of sexist , racist , homophobic & anti-semitic texts			1
this year has shown us that sexism is endemic in the game			0
it should not be acceptable to make bigoted comments ... irrespective of whether these are made publicly or privately			0
@entity104 - former @entity106 striker it ’s ok people , nothing to see , it was just banter ! @entity111 , the @entity90 ... @entity112 ! i ’m done , the @entity90 said it better than i ever could			2
they are actually being serious ! somebody drafted that ... @entity117 ! shock : former @entity119 striker @entity104 could n't believe the @entity90 's statement was serious the @entity90 wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during @entity3 ’s time at @entity31			1
in the course of a search by the @entity130 in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during mr @entity3 ’s employment at @entity31 , in relation to other matters , it emerged that @entity138 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity138 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			0
that said , @entity138 believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions			0
the precise details need to remain private for the time being until any @entity83 process is complete			2
the @entity90 does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees , like @entity138 , working under great pressure in highly charged situations			1
if @entity138 has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would , however , wish to sincerely apologise			0
@entity138 finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the @entity83 and in the media now , 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of @entity66			1
@entity138 is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media			0
it has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so			1
further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of @entity138 ’s involvement in this matter			0
@entity138 looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter			0
@entity138 can not of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others			0
@entity138 has said that he will be fully co-operating with any @entity83 investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter .			2
