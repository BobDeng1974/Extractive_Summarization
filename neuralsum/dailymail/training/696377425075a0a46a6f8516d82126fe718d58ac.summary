@entity0 and @entity1 are prepared to take @entity2 on loan for a year , in a deal which will appeal to @entity5 if they can secure the right to recall him			1
@entity2 is facing the prospect of a year on the sidelines after @entity10 selected @entity11 for the opening game of the season at @entity14			1
@entity10 , who is also exploring the idea of swapping @entity16 with 23 - year - old @entity18 striker @entity17 , would prefer to keep both goalkeepers at the club but accepts @entity2 ’s desire to play regularly			1
@entity2 is an obvious candidate to leave , although @entity10 is concerned in case @entity11 suffers any problems with fitness or form as he adjusts to the @entity37 game			2
there were no adjustment issues at @entity40 though and @entity11 has played consistently well on loan at @entity42			0
back - up keeper @entity43 will be 42 in october and @entity10 will have doubts that he can play for an extended run as @entity5 challenge on four fronts , should it be necessary			0
the loan with a recall option would deliver @entity5 some peace of mind , although any recall would only be possible in january			0
the deal for @entity17 and @entity16 is less straightforward as it requires an agreement over @entity16 ’ wages			0
happy with both : @entity10 insists he wants both to stay but must cut a foreign player from his squad			2

@entity2 set to join @entity0 and @entity1 on year - long loan
@entity5 must cut one foreign player from @entity27 squad and two from @entity30 squad before transfer window ends on september 1
@entity10 appears to make @entity11 first - choice goalkeeper at @entity5 after opting for *22* - year - old in opening game at @entity14
