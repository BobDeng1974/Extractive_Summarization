by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 recorded one of the best and one of the worst victories of his life in the second round of the @entity8			1
the 20 - year - old @entity9 is among the most exciting young talents around and he made the last 32 at a grand slam for the first time by coming from two sets down to defeat 11th seed @entity14 4 - 6 3 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 3			1
but it was not a match he enjoyed because @entity14 is his training partner and mentor			1
inspired : @entity2 came from two sets down for the first time in his career to beat @entity14 good friends : the pair train together and @entity2 says he did not enjoy beating his @entity26 friend the pair share a coach in @entity29 and travel the world together			1
they even warmed up together before friday 's match , but that was all that was normal about it			2
' i hated the situation , ' said @entity2			1
' it 's something really , really special , it 's a really great win for me			1
it 's my first time coming back from two sets to zero , first time five sets			1
' but i would prefer it against anybody else			2
' @entity14 appeared to have the match in his grasp but struggled with cramp in the fourth and fifth sets			1
he said : ' a lot of my energy went on the mental part , the nerves that started before the match			2
probably if i would play somebody else , i would be more relaxed			2
' i thought that it 's not going to be so difficult , but mentally it was difficult			2
we were both really nervous throughout the match			0
we both played far from our best tennis			0
eyes on the prize : @entity59 , 20 , stayed strong physically and mentally to reach the last 32 for the first time distraught : @entity14 has been unable to replicate his @entity63 form since reaching the semi-final in @entity65 ' the level we play in practice is much higher than we did today			1
this was not a nice game			0
but he showed character , so it 's really good			0
it 's good for him			0
' @entity76 plays 19th seed @entity77 , and @entity14 hopes his friend can keep his run going			1
' the positive is that @entity2 is in the third round , ' said the @entity26			1
' he has an okay draw , so i wish him the best			0
nothing is positive for me			0
' @entity14 was once where @entity2 is now as a bright young thing of the tour , but he enjoyed life away from the court too much to realise his potential			1
over the last two seasons @entity14 has grown up and knuckled down and the results have followed , the highlight being a run to the @entity63 semi-finals this summer			1
since @entity65 , though , he has won just four matches in five tournaments , slipping out of the top 10 almost as soon as he climbed into it			0
feeling the heat : despite a good start the @entity26 was unable to close out the game , blaming mental fatigue ' at @entity105 definitely i was a little bit overwhelmed from my @entity65 results , ' he said			0
' it was tough for me			0
' afterwards i took some time off			2
then i had a good two weeks of practice			0
' i did my homework			0
you never know when the results are going to come			0
' unfortunately now is a grand slam			1
everybody wishes that his top form is coming for the grand slam			1
' now i have to look forward to @entity119			0
if i play really , really well , i still have a chance for the @entity121			0
i just need to win something big			2
a loss is a loss , but it 's fine			0

@entity9 reaches grand slam last 32 for the first time by beating @entity14
