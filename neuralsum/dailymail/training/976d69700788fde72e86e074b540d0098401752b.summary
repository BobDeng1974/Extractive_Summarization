these extraordinary photographs appear to show a tree hovering in the air after despite having had a section cut out of its trunk			1
but in fact it is a clever optical illusion - created using nothing more than a piece of plastic and some spray paint			0
the surreal creation was the brainchild of graphic designers @entity16 and @entity17 , from @entity18 in @entity19			1
they found an appropriate tree by the side of the road , and wrapped part of its trunk in plastic sheeting			1
the artists then painted a landscape on the plastic designed to imitate the countryside around it perfectly			2
this gives the illusion that the tree is completely see - through			0
work in progress : the artists first applied the plastic sheeting before painting the landscape with spray paint close - up : the artwork is somewhat less convincing when viewed from an alternative angle mr @entity17 explained that the experiment was inspired by their work for design firm @entity60 , where they are used to making objects camouflaged in their surroundings			2
' the majority of customers like the transformer stations hidden so we paint the background on the object , ' he said			1
' last december just for fun - we had the idea on our minds and just wanted to try it out - we 'd never expected it to cross the world through the internet like this , the feedback is colossal			0
' now we 're asked to paint for events and customers around the world			0
' a video of the illusion in place has attracted nearly 800,000 views since being posted on @entity85 .			0

@entity19 graphic designers wrapped tree trunk in plastic sheet then painted *hyper* - realistic landscape on it
they got idea from being asked to make transformer stations *disappear*
