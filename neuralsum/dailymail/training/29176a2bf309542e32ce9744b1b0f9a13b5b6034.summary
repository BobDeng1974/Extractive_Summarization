more than @entity3 ’s form , @entity5 ’s fitness or the future of @entity7 , @entity1 manager @entity0 will ultimately be judged on the nine players he signed last summer at a cost of £ 117 million			1
the early signs are not good			0
as they return to @entity14 , the scene of @entity17 ’s tears when the title was conceded in may , only full back @entity11 could be labelled a success			1
others like @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 — total spend £ 65m — have fallen far short of expectations			1
way off his @entity40 form			0
only six @entity34 appearances , average less than 70 minutes each			0
@entity42 , 25 , @entity43 , £ 20m verdict : hit			1
played every minute of every top - flight game but ca n’t defend alone			0
@entity45 , 20 , @entity37 , £ 20m verdict : miss. failed to adapt to the @entity35 game so far , is n’t playing regularly and low on confidence			2
@entity21 @entity48 , 24 , @entity49 , £ 16m verdict : miss. has not lived up to his truculent reputation and has yet to score in the @entity34 so far this season			1
@entity53 , 22 , @entity43 , £ 12m verdict : decent			2
has played full 90 minutes in nine of 11 @entity34 games			0
@entity27 @entity55 , 20 , @entity37 , £ 10m verdict : middling			2
a spectacular goal against @entity57 showed his talent			0
@entity22 @entity35 , 32 , @entity49 , £ 4m verdict : miss. no goals and averaging 19 minutes over nine @entity34 games			1
@entity63 ( @entity64 , 20 , @entity43 , loan verdict : settling ) & @entity66 ( @entity67 , 19 , @entity49 , £ 10m ) @entity68 taking time to adapt to a much - rotated squad			2
@entity70 on loan at @entity72			0
it was not meant to be like this			0
@entity0 was aware of the dangers of replacing superstar @entity17 with an assortment of inferior players because he had seen how @entity78 squandered their @entity80 revenue 12 months earlier after he was sold to @entity81 for a world record fee in excess of £ 85m			1
yet so far , @entity0 seems to have fallen into the same trap			1
@entity21 and @entity22 have failed to score a @entity34 goal , while @entity24 has looked shaky at the back			1
@entity27 , a £ 10m buy from @entity87 , strained a calf muscle on his debut in a pre-season friendly at @entity91 and then suffered an ankle injury on duty for the @entity55 under - 21s which kept him out for several weeks			2
it was not until his goal against @entity57 that @entity1 fans caught a glimpse of why @entity0 went for the midfielder , whose gifts are technical rather than athletic			1
can , a @entity55 of @entity105 family origin , acknowledges that the new recruits have taken time to settle			0
and he knows it is time for them to show their potential and lift @entity1 from a mid-table position towards a top - four spot			1
‘ we ’ve had a lot of players coming in and it will take a little bit of time to adapt , but i am certain there will be better results , ’ he said , speaking on a visit to the @entity115 where he and other first - team players met and talked to the next generation of @entity120 stars			2
‘ i struggled in the beginning because i was injured in my first game and could n’t get back to 100 per cent fitness			0
i have n’t played many games yet , but the season is long so there is time for people to improve and come in and show what they have been bought for			0
‘ i see every day in training that we have a great team working together really well			0
we have been unlucky at certain points , but we know it ’s about time that we got results , and i ’m confident we can do that			0
’ @entity27 has been hampered by injuries since sealing a summer move from @entity87 having sold @entity17 to @entity144 , for £ 75m , @entity0 could have done without @entity5 suffering a series of injuries which will keep him out at least until the @entity147			1
three players — @entity149 , @entity3 and @entity7 — are in contract negotiations and none of the trio are playing at their peak			2
club captain @entity7 has been dismayed at the length of time it has taken to approach him over a deal and he knows there are clubs like @entity160 who want him			2
so , from being on the brink of a new era last season , @entity1 appear to be back in decline			1
which is why it makes sense for owner @entity169 and chairman @entity170 to look for added investment , and why the chatter around @entity173 will not go away			0
it is two weeks since @entity169 was joined by former @entity1 chief executive @entity175 in @entity173 to meet @entity176 , a prominent businessman in the emirate			1
the club insist it was a private meeting unrelated to football and it is true that @entity169 and @entity176 do share an interest in healthcare , the latter being the chief executive of @entity186 while @entity169 and his wife , @entity188 , fund health research as part of their charitable foundation in @entity192			2
@entity1 sold star striker @entity17 to @entity144 for £ 75million in the summer owner @entity169 was joined by former chief executive @entity175 in @entity173 to meet @entity176 but @entity176 is also on the board of @entity194 , a real estate company which built the world ’s largest skyscraper , the @entity197			1
and he has close links to sheik @entity199 , the vice-president and prime minister of the @entity202 and monarch of @entity173			0
in addition , he sits on the @entity194 board with @entity206 , the chairman of @entity207 , the @entity199 ’s personal wealth fund , which agreed to buy the club in 2007 but lost out to @entity210 and @entity211			2
@entity1 lost £ 48.85m last season and £ 40.52m the year before			1
# if @entity213 use the figures provided by the club ’s holding company , @entity215 , the prognosis is even worse : £ 69.67m loss recorded in 2013 and £ 54.68m in 2012			1
the club are on notice from @entity213 for being in potential breach of the @entity223 regulations and will submit their latest figures this month			0
under @entity213 rules , a @entity173 investor could not wipe out the debts but @entity1 could increase their sponsorship and commercial income through @entity232 links			1
the rebuild of the main stand — the £ 75m investment would be exempt from @entity213 rules — could be funded by @entity173			0
a naming rights sponsor would ease expenditure and a new club sponsor needs to be negotiated because the @entity239 deal expires in 2016			0
it looks as though work will begin in the @entity147 and @entity1 have requested that their final game of the season is away in order to squeeze in an extra week of work			1
that will lift stadium capacity to 55,000 and the @entity120 expansion will then take it up to 60,000			0
@entity175 , with contacts in the @entity232 and a direct line to @entity169 , might be the man to broker the deals to build the stadium			0
first , though , they must exorcise the ghosts of @entity256			0
with top - four hopes fading and their @entity260 bid resting on a midweek trip to @entity262 , it is time for @entity0 ’ new buys to start showing their true worth .			1

@entity0 will be judged on the nine players he signed in summer
