once tipped for greatness like his @entity3 team - mate @entity2 , @entity0 hit rock bottom with a telephone call from his club @entity6 in february 2013			1
@entity0 was ordered in and it was confirmed he had failed a drugs test			1
the anabolic steroid nandrolone had been discovered in his system and once the wheels of justice had turned , he was hit with a two - year ban — the longest punishment for any current professional player in @entity16			1
but behind the bald facts of a so - called ‘ drugs cheat ’ is a tragic story of a young player driven to depression and despair by the difficulties he faced trying to achieve his dream			1
@entity0 always maintained he never deliberately took performance - enhancing drugs			1
he was in constant agony caused by a chronic shoulder injury that saw it come out of its socket every day in training			0
when his cousin @entity53 offered pain relief with an injection , @entity0 agreed out of desperation , not suspecting he might be contravening anti-doping regulations			1
that summer of 2013 when the ban was imposed passed in a blur for @entity0 , who was 21 at the time			1
‘ i thought , that ’s me finished , ’ he said			0
‘ i could n’t be bothered with football any more			2
‘ i kept playing it over in my mind			0
i was sure my chance in football was over and all i ’d ever be remembered for was failing a drugs test			1
’ it seemed a devastating end to a once promising career			0
having first joined @entity3 at the tender age of seven , @entity0 was held in high regard at the club during his teenage years			1
but the @entity43 has given him the green light to find a new club and start training again he had been on the books at @entity3 since the age of just seven experienced coaches there including @entity82 , a league championship and @entity85 trophy winner with the club , and academy director @entity87 thought he would make it along with another emerging youngster , @entity2			1
but the downward spiral began when he suffered the first dislocation of his shoulder			0
what happened next would fill a medical journal			0
two operations on his shoulder , a fractured metatarsal , broken collar bone , torn cartilage , viral meningitis and four separate ankle ligament injuries , the worst after chipping an ankle with the @entity104 under - 16s			2
@entity3 manager @entity105 reluctantly let him go at 19			1
but spells at @entity107 and @entity6 , punctuated by a loan spell at @entity110 club @entity111 , saw the curse continue			0
so when @entity53 offered him a cure for the pain , @entity0 foolishly took it			1
he said : ‘ looking back , i was just desperate			0
i was going to training and my shoulder was popping out all the time			0
sometimes , it would n’t even be a tackle			0
i ’d just be running and it happened			0
‘ i felt a fraud			0
i could n’t call myself a footballer because i could n’t train or play properly			0
i had n’t had a full season since i was 16			0
’ @entity6 , then in @entity121 , ripped up his contract when the ban was confirmed			0
at @entity0 ’s lowest ebb , an unlikely saviour stepped forward			1
his brother @entity126 , a former junior goalkeeper with @entity127 , had been in prison for drug smuggling when @entity0 went through his injury hell			1
@entity0 for @entity3 during the @entity132 match against @entity133 in 2011 @entity0 was a former team - mate of current @entity3 and @entity16 star @entity2 former @entity3 boss @entity105 reluctantly let @entity0 leave the club when he was 19 now back out and clean , @entity126 decided to make up for lost time and help his younger sibling			1
he arranged for the shoulder injury to be cleared up properly , with one of the country ’s leading surgeons operating on @entity0 for five hours			2
@entity126 also persuaded the leading stakeholders in football that his brother was a victim of circumstance rather than a deliberate drugs cheat			2
the players ’ union , the @entity146 , arranged for @entity0 to use the facilities used by @entity16 players at @entity150 because his ban prevented him from training with football clubs			1
most importantly , the @entity43 ’s disciplinary committee decided to allow him to train again with a football club from november 5 , ahead of the complete lifting of his playing ban on february 4 , 2015			1
the midfielder will take advantage by training with his local club @entity127 from the @entity160 , though the longer - term hope would be to play higher up the pyramid			2
‘ this will be like starting all over again , ’ he says			0
a fortnight ago , @entity0 was shopping in @entity127 town centre and by chance bumped into his pal @entity2 , now an @entity16 international			1
‘ of course we stopped and chatted to each other , we played together for years did n’t we , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ funnily enough , the conversation was n’t about football , more about how we ’re doing and everything else			0
@entity2 was a talent even at 14 , it ’s no surprise to me he ’s flying now			2
’ the pair could not have travelled in more opposite directions since their youth - team days			2
but training with @entity127 next month is a huge date in @entity0 ’s diary			2
the dream is still alive .			0
