by @entity0 published : 15:37 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 13 september 2013 support : archbishop dr @entity2 said it made ' no theological sense ' to oppose women bishops women will be allowed to become bishops in @entity8 ’ @entity10 churches following a landmark vote that will surely put pressure on the @entity10 to follow suit			1
members of the @entity8 ’ 144 - strong governing body voted through the proposals at a meeting in @entity18 , near @entity19 in west @entity8 , earlier today			1
supporters and women ’s rights groups called the decision long overdue , arguing the exclusion of women from the top roles made the church less relevant in modern society			1
@entity8 has now joined @entity28 and @entity29 in opening their doors to the ordination of women bishops , leaving just the @entity10 opposed to the idea			1
the issue was hotly debated at the @entity8 ’ governing body meeting in the @entity36			1
the vote needed a two thirds majority from three of the @entity8 ’ ' houses ' - @entity39 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
@entity39 voted 57 for and 14 against , with @entity41 backing the move 37 to 10			2
@entity42 ’ vote was unanimously in favour of the plan			2
archbishop of @entity8 , dr @entity48 , said it made ' no theological sense ' to continue opposing the ordination of women as bishops when the church already ordained them as deacons and priests			1
it is the second time in five years it had faced the issue			0
a previous proposal was defeated in 2008 by just three votes			0
the @entity62 was proposed by the six diocesan bishops of the @entity8			1
@entity65 @entity64 of @entity66 , @entity67 , said : ' i ’m happy with @entity69 but would be just as happy with bishop @entity70			0
' @entity71 , stewardship officer for the @entity72 , added : ' do we really care whether the bishop has external or internal plumbing ? ' @entity65 @entity75 , from @entity76 , @entity77 , said the @entity78 itself says there should be no differences between people			0
' it ’s @entity85 - like people that the church chooses as bishops and i hope and pray that the @entity8 gives an unqualified and unreserved yes to the @entity85 - like qualities of our women priests alongside our men , ' she added			1
however , father @entity93 , from @entity2 , said it could be difficult for some people to stay in the church if women bishops were allowed			1
he said : ' the bishop ’s role is to hold the diocese together , and for those of us who in good conscience can not accept the sacramental ministry of a woman bishop means we can not be in communion with that bishop			0
' we are told we have an honoured place within the church but that place is going to be difficult if not impossible for us to stay and remain			0
@entity85 - like : @entity111 argued there were no differences between people in the @entity78 ' there may come a time when it is impossible for me to function as a priest in the @entity8			2
' dr @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 , said the church should not feel it has to do what secular society says			0
however , unlike democratic political elections , the @entity8 takes all views into account in making its decisions			2
and one contentious microcosm of debate was what level of protection should be afforded to those who fiercely objected to the plans			0
calls had been made for changes to the @entity8 ’ constitution for priests who did not want to be led by a woman , which would have prompted a second vote at a later date			1
some argued that allowing greater room for objectors by going to a second vote later in the year could avert a division opening up in the church			2
however , those in favour of going to a straight yes / no vote - where any decision would come into effect within one year - said the matter needed to be resolved now			0
passionate : archbishop of @entity159 @entity158 is in favour of women bishops the decision to allow women to be ordained as bishops in the @entity10 was narrowly defeated last year			1
the matter went before the @entity10 's @entity167 's governing body in november			2
despite it being approved by the @entity169 and @entity170 , the proposition was rejected by the @entity167 's @entity170			0
as with the @entity8 , each house needed a two thirds majority in favour for the vote to be approved			2
in the @entity170 , 74 voted against with 132 in for			0
had another six members voted in favour , the motion would have been passed			0
archbishop of @entity159 the @entity179 @entity158 is firmly in favour of the ordination of women bishops and had been looking at dissolving the @entity167 and holding fresh elections			1
but in july the @entity167 voted in favour of looking at the matter again by 319 votes to 84			0
the @entity167 is unlikely to vote on the matter again until 2015 at the earliest .			0

the @entity10 in @entity8 ' three houses were *overwhelmingly* in support
archbishop said it made ' no theological sense ' to oppose women bishops
@entity10 joins @entity28 and @entity29 in allowing women bishops
just the @entity10 now remains opposed to the idea
