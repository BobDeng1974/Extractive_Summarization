@entity0 upstaged title rivals @entity1 and @entity3 by posting the quickest lap during the opening practice session for the @entity6			1
@entity0 relished the tight confines of the marina bay street circuit , setting a time of 1 minute , 49.056 seconds - a tenth of a second ahead of @entity3 , with third - place @entity1 only two hundredths of a second off the pace of his team - mate and championship rival			1
the @entity17 pair of @entity18 and @entity19 finished fourth and fifth on the timesheets , but the former suffered an engine problem at the end of the session and was forced to stop on track			1
@entity0 was quickest under the lights during the opening practice session at the @entity27 @entity1 towels himself down ahead of the first session			1
@entity3 is 22 points adrift of the @entity30 @entity1 had an issue with a loose wing mirror during the session and had to remove it while he was driving @entity0 's team - mate , @entity35 , put in a competitive showing with seventh place , behind @entity39 's @entity38 , who performed strongly before his car suffered an electronics failure that briefly saw him block the pit exit			1
@entity43 also had technical difficulties that restricted his running but was eighth fastest , followed by @entity39 's @entity46 and @entity48 's @entity47			0
the @entity50 cars were surprisingly uncompetitive			0
while this twisty circuit was expected to count against a team that thrived on the flowing @entity55 and @entity56 tracks in the previous two races , it was still surprising to see @entity58 down in the 13th and @entity59 in 15th			2
@entity18 , who has been plagued by reliability issues this season , stopped on track at the end of the session near the pit - lane exit complaining of an engine issue			1
@entity18 was hit with an engine issue during the clsoing stages of the opening session in @entity70 team principal @entity71 has confirmed @entity18 will be lucky to make it back on track for the second session			1
@entity71 said : ' it looks like an engine problem , a sudden loss of engine oil pressure , which usually means something pretty nasty			2
' the engine changes on this car take around three and a half hours , so there 's a lot of work to do			2
' it 's going to be tough			0
the biggest loss is the track time and the long run			2
@entity18 does n't seem to have much luck at the moment			1

@entity121 ( @entity94 ) @entity115 - @entity92 1:55.170 it was the first session run under the new restrictions on pit - car radio transmissions			0
while the @entity126 relented on friday and delayed until 2015 a ban on radio messages about car performance , they did retain a ban on driver coaching - instructions on braking points , gear selection , car set - up at various points on the circuit , etc. however old habits die hard , and @entity1 , who suffered with a loose wing mirror early on in the session , and @entity3 were heard asking their team about other drivers ' tyres and performance - banned under the new regulations - and received curt replies from the garage			1
when @entity3 asked as to the wear rate on rivals ' tyres , the radio message in reply was : ' just carry on with our program and we 'll discuss it in the garage			2
' the opening 90 - minute session was free of any major incident , with all but @entity100 's @entity103 having driven the circuit before and learnt to adjust to its bumpy surface , long and technical layout , and close - in barriers			2
@entity3 appeared in relaxed spirits during the session			1
he won last time out at the @entity56 @entity6			0

@entity0 was quicker than both of the @entity95 drivers in opening session
@entity18 stopped on track at end of the session with engine issue
@entity1 22 points ahead of @entity3 with six races remaining
