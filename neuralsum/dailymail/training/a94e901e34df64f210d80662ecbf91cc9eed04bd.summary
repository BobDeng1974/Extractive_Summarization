by @entity1 reporter published : 19:35 est , 14 july 2013 updated : 19:37 est , 14 july 2013 with everything you can eat and drink thrown in , all - inclusive deals are promoted as the most economic way of enjoying your holiday			2
but they may not always be such good value , according to a survey			0
bed and breakfast holidays where you buy your own drinks and eat out at restaurants can be £ 700 a week cheaper than a comparable all - inclusive break			0
a seven - night bed and breakfast trip to the @entity19 , for example , could be £ 648 cheaper per couple than an all - inclusive break in the same region where food and drink are part of the cost			1
@entity27 trips to @entity28 and to @entity30 ’s @entity29 are also better value than all - inclusives			1
however , those visiting @entity30 ’s @entity34 , @entity35 or @entity36 would be better off going all - inclusive			1
bargain : a couple travelling to the @entity19 in @entity39 could save almost £ 700 by not going all inclusive the study by @entity41 also found that one in six holidaymakers on all - inclusive breaks went out for restaurant meals , at extra cost , to avoid the repetition of eating in the hotel			1
researchers compared the cheapest seven - night @entity27 and all - inclusive packages for two adults departing from @entity53 airports available on june 21 for travel between july 24 and august 6 this year			2
package prices included return flights and three / four - star accommodation for two adults			0
for @entity27 packages the cost of evening meals , beer and @entity62 was added to provide a comparison with all - inclusive			0
the findings showed that those on @entity27 deals would pay £ 857 per couple compared with £ 1,505 for an all - inclusive package			2
in @entity28 , the @entity27 deal was £ 144 better than the all - inclusive one , and in the @entity29 those on @entity70 would be £ 5.43 better off			1
savings : but all inclusive breaks in @entity35 are better value than paying for meals yourself an all - inclusive deal was the better option by £ 54 in both @entity36 and @entity35 and by £ 6.69 in the @entity34 of 40 hotels surveyed , 30 excluded bottles of wine from their all - inclusive deals , although house wine by the glass was on offer			1
dates in early july and september were also checked and results were consistent with the july / august findings			0
@entity88 of @entity41 said : ‘ holidaymakers need to be aware of what is included to avoid getting caught out			0
‘ in some destinations like the @entity19 and @entity93 , where restaurant prices have fallen dramatically this year , it may be cheaper to book a @entity27 package and eat out each day			0

couples can save £ 648 by not going all - inclusive in the @entity19 , @entity39
@entity27 is also better value in @entity28 and the @entity29 , @entity30
but all - inclusive is best in @entity36 , @entity35 and @entity30 *'s* @entity34
