the average full - time salary in the @entity12 is £ 27,000			1
to add to their good fortune , it emerged @entity2 , yesterday dubbed ' @entity16 ' , plans to pay its workers even more to get round controversial new @entity19 bonus laws			1
@entity2 ( chief executive @entity20 pictured ) made more money in its investment banking division in 2013 than in any other year in its history @entity23 , the @entity25 mp and member of the @entity27 , said : ' @entity2 would be better renamed ' @entity16 ' with these extraordinary levels of pay			0

' under the new rules , a banker can be paid a bonus equal to their annual salary			1
it is also possible to pay a bonus worth twice their annual salary , if shareholders approve			1
the new rules only affect @entity19 banks , or the @entity19 offices of banks whose headquarters are based elsewhere in the world			1
as a result , @entity54 - based bankers at @entity2 were demanding to leave the capital and move to places such as @entity58 and @entity59 where they would not be hit by the cap			2
at present , a @entity2 worker is typically paid a basic salary plus an annual bonus			1
under the new proposals , senior staff will also get a third tranche of pay , known as ' role - based pay '			1
@entity25 mp @entity23 said the bank ' would be better renamed @entity16 ' this will protect their bonus payouts because it will be a multiple - one or two times - of a larger payout , that is their basic salary plus their new role - based pay			1

the shares , priced at £ 3.30 , were yesterday worth nearly double at £ 6.04 each			0
it comes after sir @entity114 , chairman of @entity115 , expressed his shock at bankers who are ' absolutely outraged ' to only earn £ 4million a year			2
at a conference last year , he revealed the ' completely out of body experiences ' negotiating people 's pay packages at the state - owned bank with people who occupy a ' different world			1
' sir @entity114 recalled one meeting when a man was complaining bitterly that he only earned £ 4million a year when a rival at another bank earned £ 6million for doing the same job			2
he said : ' i can tell you i 've had some completely out of body experiences in recent years where i was talking to somebody about potentially getting a £ 4million pay package			2
the bank also announced plans to pay employees more as a way to get round new @entity19 bonus laws ' and outrage coming across the table from the other side because they know that somebody doing a comparable job at another bank is getting £ 6million			1
' and this is absolutely outrageous to them			0
that somebody is getting 50 per cent more			0
' sir @entity114 , who earns a basic salary of £ 750,000 a year , said many bankers think it is ' very , very , very unfair that they are only left with £ 4million to rub along with			2
