the hardest thing about being one of the actors in @entity3 is that people expect me to know all the answers			1
for two long years after @entity8 ’ apparent jump to his death , wherever i went people would ask me ‘ how will they do it ? how will they bring him back ? ’ when i told them i did n’t know , it was the truth			1
and as much as i asked , nudged , and twisted arms to find out , no one would tell me anything until the scripts were finished			1
there ’s a culture of secrecy around them which is absolutely right , even it if it is infuriating			1
equally clueless : @entity27 tells his story of of life behind the scenes of @entity3 and how he still does not know exactly how @entity3 faked his death the scripts for the third series arrived at my @entity36 home last spring , and if you ’d been the kind of @entity3 - obsessive who listens at doors , you would have heard a mixture of ‘ wow ’ , ‘ oh my @entity40 ! ’ and ‘ i ca n’t believe you did that ! ’			1
the scripts arrived just a couple of days before our first read - through at a rundown church in @entity46			1
it was the first time the cast had been in the same room together for two years , and we all got a bit giggly because we were so excited			2
it ’s a lovely team — and the success of the show binds us together			2
it ’s rare to be in anything that has an impact as big as @entity3 , and we are all enjoying it			1
afterwards , the show ’s creator and writer @entity60 reminded us not to breathe a word			2
the scripts are carefully crafted and you do n’t want to ruin the surprise — however much people ask			2
and , boy , do they keep asking			2
@entity67 ’s life changed the moment the first episode of @entity3 aired			1
his profile has become extraordinary			2
i think he found it overwhelming at first			2
he gets a huge amount of attention wherever he goes , and i do n’t think he can even get on the @entity76			2
love and hate : @entity27 's character inspector @entity79 has mixed feelings about @entity3 because my role is so much smaller , i do n’t have to deal with anything like that , though people often think they know me and sometimes mistake me for someone they met at their daughter ’s wedding			1
from the moment i read the very first @entity3 script , i knew i wanted to be involved			1
it was an astonishing , adrenalin - filled action story , without actually much action in it			1
the adrenalin is all verbal : it comes from @entity3 ’s mouth			1
his reasoning and intelligence is almost like that of a superpower			2
i like being the character who anchors him into the real police world			2
i ’m the hapless @entity79 , whose relationship with @entity3 is interesting			1
he both loves him and he resents him			2
it ’s not really anything do to with class			2
he knows he needs @entity3 ’s brilliance , and he is angry at himself for not being brilliant			1
he is quite out of his depth with @entity3 — and he knows it			1
he looks flummoxed a lot			2
i ’ve never played a copper before , and not playing the upper - class boy for once is nice			2
because my name is @entity27 and i starred in some glossy @entity116 films , people have always assumed i ’m posh and put me up for those parts			1
it ’s never something i ’ve been comfortable with			0
for a long time i wanted to change my name to @entity120			0
i love working with @entity67 and am full of admiration for him			0
he ’ll have to learn three pages of speeches which are like verbal car chases — and i ’ll just have to interject with the odd word , like ‘ @entity127 ’			0
he has to work hugely long hours , but even when he ’s doing night scenes after working all day , he ’ll still be spinning around the room			1
it ’s like watching fireworks go off			0
i ’d be lying if i did n’t admit there was a part of me that would have loved to have been @entity3			1
after i ’ve been on the show , i spend about a week pretending to be him			0
did that woman have those shoes on before ? if she changed them , why ? what caused that scratch on that man ’s face ? but there are very few actors who could have played this version of @entity3 , and @entity67 is the best of them			1
he has this very fast front - footed energy , which is perfect for this part			0
he always runs full pelt into a speech , and each take is always different			0
it does mean he occasionally stumbles , but what he does is brave ; alive			0
filming the wedding scenes in this last series were particularly fun			1
we spent two weeks at @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160			0
it was a great chance to catch up as we do n’t often get to appear in scenes together			1
we watched , chewing three - day old cheese , as @entity67 and @entity164 recorded scene after scene			0
there are worse ways to earn a living ; it felt like a little holiday			0
there was some socialising — but i think people would be surprised at how tame our nights out are			0
when i started out , actors would get drunk all the time , but people work a lot harder now			0
@entity3 has always been very much a family affair			1
it ’s produced by creator @entity60 ’s partner @entity182 , and her mother @entity183 , a @entity184 stalwart , is the executive producer			0
for me , that ’s what makes it so good			0
together , they have the power and the ability and the means to achieve their vision			0
not over yet : @entity67 as @entity8 and @entity194 as doctor @entity195 are set to return for a fourth and a fifth season being with @entity60 and fellow creator @entity197 is sometimes like stumbling into a @entity3 geek convention , because they know everything there is to know about him			1
you can see how they love the fact they ’ve made @entity3 into the extraordinary character he was when he was invented all those years ago			1
the detective genre has moved on since @entity208 wrote the books , but now he has been reinvented he is a well - loved and astonishing figure all over again			0
the family theme has continued this series			0
@entity3 ’s parents were played by @entity67 ’s real parents , who are both actors			1
they were both very nice , very normal people , who seemed really excited to be on the set			0
dr @entity195 ’s wife @entity216 was played by @entity164 ’s partner @entity217 , while @entity60 and @entity182 ’s son @entity218 was cast as the young @entity3			1
do i know what will happen next ? of course not			0
i ’m still as confused as anyone about exactly how @entity3 came back			1
i think it was a bit smoke and mirrors , but that was deliberate			0
it ’s always dull hearing how a magic trick was done			0
everyone is keen to make another series soon , and i ’ve already driven my agent mad to find out when it will be			0
we are all waiting to find out what will happen next			0
is @entity234 really back ? did he actually die ? will there be a @entity237 special ? i would n’t tell you even if i knew			0
but i genuinely wo n’t know until that script lands on my doormat			0
hopefully it will be soon .			0
