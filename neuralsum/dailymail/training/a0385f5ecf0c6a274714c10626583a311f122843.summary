@entity0 competed in 152 @entity2 races over 10 years			2
he won five times , including the @entity4 for @entity5 , and scored 169 career points			2
after leaving the sport in 1985 , @entity0 has forged a successful media career , and today he writes for @entity9			2
following the fall - out from the @entity11 , @entity0 assesses the fractious relationship beetween @entity13 and @entity14 , and asks whether @entity15 could have handled the situation in a better fashion			1
if you go back to qualifying , i can understand why @entity13 was upset because he did not do anything wrong and he got caught up in @entity14 ’s incident which , in my opinion , was not pre-meditated			1
that said , it did work advantageously for @entity14			1
i had an incident for @entity5 at the 1980 @entity11 where i did n’t qualify for the race and i was overly negative about everything			0
from then i learned that all you can do is put what has happened behind you			0
you can not change it , so there is no point carrying the grudge forward			0
if @entity13 wanted to believe @entity14 ’s accident was pre-meditated then there is nothing anyone could have said to him to change his mind			1
but nonetheless , it is history and you ca n’t do anything about it			0
frosty : @entity13 's attitude after @entity14 's ' error ' in qualifying reflected badly and did n't help him controversial : @entity14 was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in saturday 's qualifying session it reflected badly on him that he retained the grudge , taking it right through to saturday evening , then the race , the podium , and , i gather , later on when the pair of them were out that evening socialising			1
both @entity13 and @entity14 are playing mind games , and on this occasion @entity14 won the battle , and he won the grand prix , too			1
@entity13 was irked about the pit - stops , but that is what happens during a safety car period			2
it is almost as if he has got a conspiracy theory going on in his head that he was being conspired against by his own team , which is not the case , but to be honest they are both acting like a couple of pre-pubescent girls in the playground			1
@entity2 has always needed a ruck of this nature going on in a team			0
you had it with @entity83 and @entity84 , and you had it with @entity86 and @entity87 , although they were at rival teams , but it does n’t do the sport any harm			2
the trouble comes with the fact that @entity2 is potentially a dangerous sport , but both drivers behaved in the correct manner on sunday and had the right wisdom and insight to leave their handbags off the circuit			0
there was a foundation of truth in @entity13 ’s comments before the race that he is hungrier than @entity14 because of their differing backgrounds , but lest us not forget that @entity13 got picked up by @entity5 when he was 12 , and all his motor - racing from that point forward was paid for by @entity15 and @entity5 and @entity112			1
but while he may have grown up in @entity113 he is not a child anymore , he is a man			0
differing moods : @entity14 puts his thumbs up while @entity13 storms off after @entity11 qualifying it is phenomenal what he has achieved in @entity2 and he has achieved it from the determination , in part of his start in life , but he has to move on			1
both @entity13 and @entity14 have grown up in a gilded world which is as real as fantasy is			1
they are not emotionally equipped or developed to know how to deal with this battle , and i do n’t believe there is anyone of the quality of @entity134 at @entity15 who has that ability either			0
indeed , if @entity134 had been running the team , as he had been up until last year , the situation between the two drivers would have been handled a lot better			0
what you have got now at @entity15 is a very different management structure based on a different platform with different managers all at a similar level			0
then you have got @entity86 acting as ‘ the @entity147 ’			1
@entity86 is on record as saying @entity13 was ‘ unbeatable ’ after winning in @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 , and i have no doubt that there will have been an element of “ what about me ? ” from @entity14			1
in @entity151 , his body language was not positive			0
i noticed that when they were doing the group photograph , they all gave a big cheer , but @entity14 did n’t			2
tough day : @entity13 complained about getting dirt in his eye ... it was a disappointing weekend pressure : @entity15 director @entity165 must try and control the duo unconciusly , the team gravitates towards the the driver who is getting the job done , and ahead of the race in @entity11 that would have been @entity13			1
so , @entity14 will have begun to feel that he was getting subjugated out of the picture because everything was focused on @entity13 - the @entity171 having won four races on the spin			1
also , in @entity151 , it turned out that @entity13 had used a power boost button , which is saved for qualifying principally , during the race to defend his position against @entity14 who was catching him up			1
he should n’t have done that , and suddenly , all those resentments from @entity14 build into big issues			2
@entity86 said he will ‘ sort it out ’ , and he is a very pragmatic man , but in a sense he is part of the problem because has been ‘ bigging up ’ @entity13			1
i do n’t see anyone at @entity15 with the authority , the credibility and the gravitas that @entity134 had			0
if you think back to last year ’s @entity194 , @entity14 wanted to catch and pass @entity13 , and @entity134 emphatically said : “ no. hold position			1
” it is not just what you say , it is the way you say it and it is the person who says it			0
@entity14 thought about it , but then obeyed the command			2
conflict : @entity15 team boss @entity86 may have upset @entity14 by saying @entity13 was ' unbeatable ' is @entity165 more interested in talking to the press and projecting himself ? does he really have the authority ? and what of @entity209 ? he is a fantastic guy , but he is not the person to deal with this feud			1
@entity86 is a very clever man , but i do n’t know what authority he has either			2
at the end of the day , if there was one person who could kick ass in that team , it is the person that they let go			0
@entity2 is n’t like golf , tennis , boxing or any other individual sport			0
you are playing for a team , and there are responsibilities that come with that			0
it goes back to having someone on the pit - wall with authority that everybody in the team - drivers , engineers , whoever - actually respect			0
and at the minute there is nobody i see at @entity15 who has that level of respect within that management structure that @entity134 would have carried			0
@entity0 was speaking to @entity245			0

@entity13 had every right to be upset with @entity14 after qualifying
but his attitude did n't help anybody , let alone himself
@entity14 has looked upset this *season* after @entity86 praised @entity13
pair are acting like pre-pubescent girls on the playground
@entity165 must show responsibility and control them
