' i 'm mad about her ' : the photographer with his fourth wife @entity3 his reputation as a lothario during his heyday earned him the nickname @entity8			1
several decades on , with four marriages under his belt and about to turn 75 , @entity9 is as controversial as ever			1
the fashion photographer reveals he still enjoys making love to his 51 - year - old wife @entity3 , is friends with his ex-girlfriends and ex-wives – and remains unapologetic about his penchant for one night stands			1
it was a habit which saw him clash with feminist critics in the 1970s			1
but in a new tv interview he says of his conquests : ‘ like it ’s my fault they slept with me ? they had a choice , it was n’t rape or anything			2
’ the @entity31 , who will be 75 on january 2 , is inextricabily linked with the @entity32			2
the @entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity35 all posed for him			2
he established himself at @entity36 where he took pictures of @entity38 , now 70 , who was his girlfriend at one stage , and also developed his love of women			1
in the past he has said : ‘ you used to be a bad boy if you slept with a lot of women			2
people ca n’t bear that			2
i ca n’t see what ’s wrong with that really			0
’ in his interview with @entity50 to be screened on january 8 , he says : ‘ it was a bit of fun really			0
i got used , they got used			0
’ but he adds : ‘ i had a terrible time in the 70s with all those silly feminists			0
’ in a previous interview @entity8 told how he was brought up by his mother and aunt after his father walked out when he was young , and said : ‘ i was surrounded by strong women so it had never even occurred to me that women were anything other than equal to men			0
‘ then all those bloody feminists started attacking me , the silly uptight cows , having a go because i slept with more than one woman			0
’ his girlfriends included @entity71 , who lasted three years , and his former muse and model @entity72 , who survived eight years			1
happy marriage : model @entity75 appears to have finally tamed @entity8 - the couple have three children swinging @entity32 : @entity9 with @entity38 in 1963 - the photographer established himself at @entity36 taking photos of the model his marriage to first wife @entity83 lasted three years , and his second , to actress @entity85 , now 69 , lasted two			1
third wife @entity86 , 60 , was with him for ten			1
but it is model @entity75 , his fourth wife , who appears to have tamed him			1
they married in 1986 and she is the only one to present him with children – they have three : @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
and @entity8 appears to be as enamoured with her as the day he first set eyes on her			0
he said : ‘ i love making love , i love sex … i am mad about my wife			1
i think she is the sexiest woman i ’ve ever met and we ’ve been together for 30 years and if i could choose this moment who i ’d sleep with tonight it would be her			0
if i can persuade her			0
’ however , @entity8 confesses he is still close to most of his former lovers , especially 62 - year - old @entity107			0
i ’m mad about her , i think she ’s wonderful but we could n’t live together			0
‘ all my ex-girlfriends or wives are all kind of great friends and i ’ve never understood somebody who can live with somebody for five or six years and then not like them			0
