by @entity0 last week , a snappy @entity2 post from a narky bride - to - be went viral , in which the woman writes a list telling her @entity2 friends , in no uncertain terms , exactly ' why you 're not invited to our wedding			1
' the list of reasons in the rude rant include ' if your ( sic ) only going to show up for food and alcohol and really have no reason other than that ' and ' if at any point you have ever talked s * * t about me ... your ( sic ) definitely not invited			0
' but according to a @entity28 - based wedding planner , bridezillas are not a rare breed - they are everywhere and they can be terrifying			1
‘ there are a lot of crying women in the wedding - planning process			1
it ’s all just part of the job , ’ said @entity30 of @entity31			2
' it can be a stressful time , sometimes they need to have a couple of tanties or a good cry to get all the anger out			1
' a @entity2 post from a narky bride - to - be went viral last week , when the bride wrote a status explaining in very blunt terms to reasons why her friends might not have made the cut to attend her wedding according to @entity28 - based wedding planner @entity30 , bridezillas are not a rare breed ... they are everywhere and even the loveliest of woman can lose their minds during the wedding planning process ‘ lots of brides do get quite frustrated and aggravated and can take it out on people quite badly , but i do n’t think they even realise that they are doing it at the time			1
' this is where the wedding planner comes in , keeping the worst of the bridezilla behaviour at bay			1
‘ the smaller things can really get to the girls			2
you have those times when you feel like you ’re looking at three almost - identical shades of pink for a little bit too long , or worrying because the chair sash does n’t match the flower colour or something a little bit mad like that			2
' you have requests and think to yourself , ‘ flowers are natural things , you ca n’t order flowers in a specific colour shade ! ’ but , it ’s our job to find solutions , ’ explains the ever - patient mrs @entity30			1
‘ you often hear horror stories from people that work in the wedding industry and it ’s really scary			0
during the process , brides can lose it			2
i ’m always careful when i choose clients or that could be my reality ! ' laughs mrs @entity105			0
mrs @entity30 says that she is very wary of bridezillas and has learnt how to pick them out when she first meets with the future brides			0
‘ i try to weed out the bridezillas in the preliminary interviews			0
there are a lot of warning signs in that first meeting - if they ’re already hard work at that stage , it ’s going to be a long 18 months			0
’ wedding planner @entity119 , of @entity120 , on her own wedding day but even the most down - to - earth , amiable women can crack under the pressure			1
‘ each girl can get quite stressed before their wedding and can have their own bridezilla moments			1
when that happens you realise that the pressure is getting to them			0
‘ i choose to work with clients that i click with in the first meeting			0
i know that way we ’ll have a great relationship			0
but everyone can get very stressed and stop thinking rationally , ' said mrs @entity105			0
the strain of the organising the nuptials means the wedding planner often bears the brunt of the client 's stress			1
mrs @entity105 is n't surprised that the bride lost her cool over invitations , because she 's seen it happen many a time			2
' one of the most stressful parts of planning a wedding are the invitations			1
there ’s so much information to need to get right , lots of details to have to get right and the couple have to rely on people to give them addresses in time			2
i find it ’s at that point that cracks begin to show sometimes			0
' if a bride is potentially going to get stressed , it ’s also probably going to happen about two weeks before the wedding			2
girls get very emotional and that ’s when it ’s the wedding planner ’s job to be their best friend , to come up with solutions and let them know everything ’s going to be okay ! wedding planner @entity119 says that sometimes the pressure becomes too much for brides and that ' sometimes a few tanties or a good little cry is a good way to get the anger out ' the seasoned wedding planner admits she had a bridezilla moment in the lead up to her big day			1
' even i remember crying on the week of my wedding ! i cried over an issue with the ceremony booklets … but once the tantrum was done realised that no one cared about it except for me ! ’ mrs @entity30 says a wedding planner 's job is to help the event run smoothly and juggle the expectations of the many people involved			1
‘ for the wedding planner , i think it ’s just a matter of making everyone happy			1
the trickiest part of the job is n’t just the brides , there are a lot of expectations to manage			2
parents and people close to them have a lot of opinions too and can become quite precious			0
it ’s important to become the negotiator and friend to make everyone happy at the end of the day			0
' despite the challenges , mrs @entity30 says ' it 's a really fantastic job and i love my brides			1
' ' being patient is a super important trait for a wedding planner			1
you have to be organised and a great listener , to listen to what people want			0
' no matter what happens , you just have to always be upbeat and friendly and build great relationships with the brides			0
' ' the bride has a lot of expectations			0
how they 'll feel on the day , how they 'll feel in their dress , what their wedding 's going to be like			2
we need to help them make it happen			0
