@entity1 prop @entity0 has said ' i feel like i am more than just injury cover ' after announcing his retirement from international rugby			1
@entity0 , 33 , won 95 @entity1 caps and played in five tests for the @entity8			1
he is also among a group of just six @entity1 players to have featured in three @entity12 - winning teams			1
@entity1 ' @entity8 prop @entity0 had decided to call time on his international career the @entity16 prop , though , was left out of @entity1 coach @entity19 's 34 - man @entity18 training squad , which followed his omission from the autumn international series earlier this season			1
@entity19 opted for current number one @entity24 , plus @entity25 and @entity26 as his tighthead prop options in the @entity18 , which kicks off when @entity1 host @entity28 on friday week			1
in a statement released by his agents @entity32 , @entity0 said : ' this year , i promised myself that i would work as hard as possible and do everything within my power to get back into the @entity1 squad			1
' despite putting my all into this , it has become apparent that it was n't enough			0
' i feel like i am more than just injury cover , and have therefore decided to call it a day			0
' it has been a tough week for me , but the support from the @entity45 fans has been overwhelming , just as it has been ever since my first cap			0
' the 33 - year - old , pictured for the @entity8 in june 2013 , insists he is more than just injury cover @entity19 has not yet responded to @entity0 ' decision , but it is clear that the veteran tighthead has been left unimpressed by missing out on the @entity18 squad			1
before the squad was announced last tuesday , @entity0 had been strongly backed to earn a recall , especially when @entity55 forward @entity56 was ruled out of the entire @entity18 tournament due to a shoulder injury			2
speaking last tuesday during his squad announcement press conference , @entity19 said : ' at the moment , @entity24 is our number one tighthead and we have been very impressed with his progress			0
' we know exactly what @entity0 can and ca n't do , and things that he is still working on			2
' i do n't think he is the sort of player that you pick on the bench and ask to make an impact			0
he is a starting number three			0
' i know that he is working hard and the door is definitely not closed			0
when we name a larger squad of 45 in the summer to start preparing for the @entity76 , he has got a big chance of being part of that			0
' @entity0 is not the sort of player you pick on the bench and ask to make an impact , according to @entity19 @entity0 continued : ' playing for my country has been the proudest moment of my professional career			2
' however , it is now time for me to step aside and let new talent run out in the red jersey of @entity1			2
' i am committed to my club @entity16 and look forward to the rest of the season where we are targeting success in @entity95 and the @entity96			0
' as a child it was my dream to play rugby for @entity1			1
' the sport is almost a religion here , and i am honoured to have played for my country and to have represented the @entity8			1
' i have loved every minute playing for @entity1 - the highs far outweighing the lows - and i am incredibly proud of what i 've achieved and accomplished in the red jersey			2
' @entity0 and @entity106 ( left ) celebrate @entity1 ' @entity18 victory at the @entity108 in 2013 former @entity1 captain @entity109 , meanwhile , has hailed @entity0 for giving ' everything to the sport of rugby ' after he announced he is stepping down from the test arena			1
@entity0 , who skippered his namesake in @entity1 and @entity116 colours , said : ' playing alongside bomb , as he is affectionately known , has been an honour and a privilege			1
' during my captaincy and career he 's been ever - present and always one of the first names on the team sheet			0
' he was feared , respected and liked by the opposition , and a huge personality in the changing room			0
' he has given everything to the sport of rugby , and i wish him all the best at the @entity16 as he continues his club career			0
