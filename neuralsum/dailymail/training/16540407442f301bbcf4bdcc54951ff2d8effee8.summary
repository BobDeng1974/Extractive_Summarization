shocked father @entity113 , 31 , of @entity114 , @entity115 , spotted white patches covering pieces of the fruit from a @entity120 shop after he put them in a bowl - but assumed this was mould			1
however , upon closer inspection , he realised the fruit was infested with a spider nest - and immediately rang pest controllers who advised his family to leave their home immediately			2

it is not clear if these have been completed			0
