@entity0 became an internet sensation after an interview in which he just ca n't stop saying the word ' apparently ' garnered more than 4.6million views on @entity5			1
but - apparently - the adorable five - year - old is not actually sure what his favorite word even means			1
in an interview with the today show this morning , the @entity11 , @entity10 youngster earnestly admitted : ' no , i do n't know how to spell " apparently "			1
i do n't know what it means , but i use it in , " wow , this is apparently annoying			2
' i 'm tired of it , ' he said while perched on a swing in his back yard			0
still , there 's no doubt that the confident redhead has thoroughly enjoyed his 15 minutes of fame			0
when asked what it 's been like to be an overnight star , he gushed rather eloquently : ' it 's like being a thousand drops of heaven			1
' in @entity0 's original live television interview , which appeared on @entity49 on friday , a newscaster is seen approaching him on the opening day of the @entity51 in nearby @entity52			1
while reporter @entity53 was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather , @entity0 had his own agenda			1
exhibiting a fondness for the word ' apparently ' , he said : ' it was great and apparently i ’ve never been on live television but apparently sometimes i do n’t watch the news because i ’m a kid and apparently every time @entity64 just gives me the remote i have to watch the @entity66			1
' the preschooler was clearly excited to share his views , confidently holding the microphone and speaking in a somewhat newscaster - y voice			2
still attempting to get her soundbite , ms @entity53 asked again how @entity0 had enjoyed his ride , only to get more of his adorable perspective on life			2
moment in the spotlight : @entity0 confidently held the microphone and spoke in a somewhat newscaster - y voice perk of the job : the clearly amused reporter , @entity53 , is just seen crouching down to speak at @entity0 's level , while a little girl tries to get her fifteen seconds of fame too ' well , it was great because apparently you ’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy , that ’s all you do is get dizzy , ' he said			1
' i ’ve never ever been on live television			0
i 've never been on live television			0
' the amused reporter , who is seen crouching down to speak at his level , asks : ' are you excited ? ' to which @entity0 replies : ' yeah , and apparently i only went down the super slide			1
i was scared half to death			0
' @entity0 used the word ' apparently ' no less than eight times during the one - and - a - half - minute interview , and repeated that he had never been on live television three times			1
@entity0 's grandfather , @entity103 , who had accompanied him to the fair , told @entity105 : ' @entity0 is pretty talkative			2
he has a large vocabulary			0
' ' i 'm a celebrity ! ' : @entity0 's grandfather , @entity103 , says the youngster is enjoying his newfound fame @entity109 - in - the - making : @entity0 poses with his bicycle outside his home in @entity112 , @entity10 apparently , he 's now famous : @entity0 's performance has been watched over 4million times on @entity5 he added that the youngster appears to be enjoying his newfound fame			1
' we were watching it on the computer and it replayed on the local news , ' mr @entity103 said			0
' he ’s going , " that ’s me			0
" ' but for @entity0 , who is spending the summer with his grandfather , tv fame comes a lowly third place in his list of favorite things			2
mr @entity103 says his first loves are dinosaurs and swimming			0
' we go down to the history museum in @entity132 about once a month because he loves the dinosaurs , ' he said			0
' and we go for swim lessons every saturday morning because he loves to swim			0
' visit @entity134 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy			0
