two @entity1 starlets have controversially claimed that press intrusion is comparable to war and rape - in the space of just two days			1
@entity7 - winning actress @entity6 likened press coverage to ' feeling raped ' , just days after @entity10 said online abuse was like the ' dehumanising ' plight of soldiers going through war			1
both sets of remarks prompted a backlash on social media , with one charity which campaigns for sexual violence victims claiming @entity20 had ' trivialised ' rape			1
she said : ' @entity10 is a joke			2
her life is like taking bullets for a soldier			0
what a joke ! my 2 sons serving in the military should talk to her			0
' @entity55 - born @entity20 , who is in the @entity56 to promote her new film @entity59 , made the remarks after she was asked by @entity62 if she ever googled herself			1
during the interview , the 38 - year - old said : ' i do n’t do that , so that ’s my saving grace			0
when you start living in that world , and doing that , you start i guess feeling raped			0
' asked by the interviewer if she felt that strongly about the issue , she said : ' well , you know when it comes to your son and your private life			2
maybe that ’s just me			0
' some people might relish all that stuff but there are certain things in my life that i think of as very sacred and i am very protective over them			0
' backlash : one man reacted angrily to the actress 's comments on @entity88 days earlier , @entity10 had caused fury when she told a tech conference in @entity91 : ' you come across [ online comments ] about yourself and about your friends , and it 's a very dehumanising thing			1
' it 's almost like how , in war , you go through this bloody , dehumanizing thing , and then something is defined out of it			2
my hope is , as we get out of it , we 'll reach the next level of conscience			0
' i see myself as a chalkboard or a whiteboard or a screen , ' the star mused , ' and someone is just putting up their own projection on it			0
' since both sets of comments were made , social media sites have been awash with criticism for the two actresses			2
twilight star @entity121 was forced to apologise when she made similar remarks in 2010 during an interview with @entity124			1
angry : another user accused @entity20 of being a ' hypocrite ' and ' disgusting ' criticism : @entity128 said the comparison was ' ill - advised at best ' speaking about @entity20 's comments , one @entity88 user said : ' she should try telling that to a real rape victim '			1
another said : ' how stupid to comment about press intrusion the same as being raped			0
makes my blood boil ! ! ' @entity139 said : ' how dare @entity6 compare press intrusion to rape - try telling a victim of rape that			2
' @entity142 added : ' so @entity6 compared @entity144 intrusion to rape whilst giving an interview to a member of the press ... she 's a hypocrite and disgusting			0
' joint criticism : a @entity88 uses condemns both @entity6 and @entity10			1
earlier this week the @entity10 said receiving abusive comments online was like going to war @entity152 from @entity153 told @entity154 : ' to us , it is always disappointing when someone high profile uses that language and turns sexual violence into a metaphor for something else			1
' it is never appropriate and it trivialises the experience of sexual violence			1
' the experience is devastating , as we have come to learn working with women who have been through it , and the impact can be life - long or very long term			0
' press intrusion is a very difficult experience but it is not appropriate to compare it to sexual violence			1
' it 's particularly disappointing in this case because @entity6 has campaigned against sexual violence before			1
' she does n't really have an excuse and it will upset people who have survived attacks			0
' @entity183 , a victim of sexual violence , told @entity154 : ' flippant use of the word ' rape ' has somewhat devalued its devastating impact and so we must all be careful how we use it			1
' one user described the actress as a ' stupid woman ' after comparing the ' complete opposites ' @entity195 : another user was shocked by the remarks made during the interview ' vain ' : a woman advises the actress to ' get back into the real world ' after hearing the comments ' stupid statement ' : another user joins the backlash on social media by saying : ' i 'm pretty certain that press intrusion is not at all like rape			1
' ' no idea ' : one woman 's reaction to the controversial statement was straight to the point condemnation : @entity216 says the actress 's comments were ' tasteless and shallow ' the author of @entity220 , a book about her experiences , added : ' i am sure as an intelligent and insightful woman , @entity6 understands what rape truly is			2
' unsolicited press intrusion is one of the downsides of fame and @entity6 regrettably used the wrong word to describe it			0
' @entity6 , who is mother to two - year - old son @entity232 , recently opened up about her ‘ unexpected ’ romance with the 53 - year - old actor @entity234			0
the pair began a relationship at the end of last year and flew to @entity238 to celebrate @entity240 's @entity239 together			0
there have been reports in the press that he is ready to propose , but in previous interviews she has vowed not to walk down the aisle until same - sex marriage is legalised in the @entity42			0
in 1999 , the actress appeared in an advert in @entity55 where she outlined the country 's shocking rape statistics			2
a week before news of her ' conscious uncoupling ' from husband @entity254 broke , 41 - year - old @entity10 also infuriated working women across @entity42 when she said they had it easier than famous mothers			2
