' the physical you can only do so much if your mental you is lost inside of all the confusion			1

' she said she enjoyed a ' blessed and privileged ' upbringing on a small farm outside @entity45 , but later met a man who was abusive , which she suggests was caused because his ' mother was abusive to him '			1
however , she does not reveal any further details			2
she intended to finish her talk by telling them : ' go home and tell your parents , siblings , neighbours that they are appreciated			1
' you will go to bed with a happy heart and open mind for the future			2
' the speech was set to take place the day after she excitedly tweeted about her own plans for @entity8			1
the model asked her followers on @entity67 : ‘ what do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow ? ? ? # getexcited			1
’ she added : ' it should be a day of love for everyone			1

' too much to bear : @entity154 weeps in the dock as he is formally charged with the murder of his model girlfriend @entity1 at @entity91 worldwide attention : the hearing came after a two - hour delay while @entity6 's lawyers objected to the scrum of reporters that packed into the courtroom miss @entity1 was about to embark on the next stage of her dynamic and varied career , this time as a tv star , when she was killed			1
born in @entity45 on august 19 , 1983 , she later moved to @entity168 as a child where she grew up with her mother june and father @entity121 , a racehorse trainer			2
after graduating , she made a dynamic career change after being scouted and named the first face of cosmetics giant @entity174			0
she became a keen horse rider but broke her back in an horrific fall six years ago , suffering injuries so severe that she had to learn to walk again			0
her rehabilitation may have brought her into @entity6 's path , and friends said she had admired his single - minded determination to race			1
she moved to @entity18 six years ago and since then has travelled between the city and @entity45 to film and shoot some of @entity100 's leading campaigns and commercials			0
@entity185 , @entity12 , @entity186 and @entity188 brand @entity187 are some of the more prestigious clients she has worked for			0
speaking in an interview in 2012 , she said : ' at the end of last year i made an application to the bar			2
' it was a nerve - wracking experience			0
as i walked out i got the call for the @entity12 shoot as well as two others			0
i made a decision to take the modelling shoots			0
i believe in destiny and faith			0
' this weekend , @entity1 was set to star in @entity100 reality television series @entity202 , in which celebrities and ordinary people compete in remote , exotic locations in a variety of daily challenges			0
below are the rough notes @entity107 made for the speech at @entity211 , a co-educational government school in @entity18			1
they are reproduced exactly as she wrote them			0
' @entity214 ' stands for @entity168 , the town on @entity100 's south coast where @entity107 grew up , while ' @entity18 ' is @entity100 's commercial capital @entity217 received flowers / chocolates / cards / messages / tweets / etc today ( february 14 ) for @entity8 ? tell them what i received , make a small joke about this			1
and then tell them that receiving those things is very special but not receiving anything does n't define you as a person or make you less valued ! ! ! 1			2
i was raised on a small farm just outside of @entity45			0
in a way i was blessed and privileged to be away from the pressures of city life and i grew up to appreciate the simpler things above the superficial			0
i will chat about life on the farm , having no money but being blessed with amazing parents who never allowed me to be aware of my circumstances			2
some ' looking back now ' points somewhere after this would fit in			0
after moving to @entity214 and deciding to study law despite our financial situation , i worked hard to be acknowledged as one of the top 15 per cent academics at university so that my studies could be 80 % covered by bursaries and i worked to pay off the rest			0
i broke my back towards the end of varsity			2
learnt mobility again and made a massive life decision with regards to my career			0
i will elaborate on this part of my journey			0
i was in an abusive relationship at the same time ( his mother used to abuse him ) and all together these factors encouraged my move to @entity18			1
despite my height disadvantage and the difficulty in general of breaking into the modeling industry , i put my head down and worked hard towards my dream			0
i lost a lot of self worth during my last year in @entity214 before i moved to @entity18 and it took some serious soul searching to remind myself of my value in this world			1
being loved by others , although an amazing feeling to have the appreciation of others , does not define your place in the world			0
acknowledge your absolute ' @entity289 ' in life and work on your ' @entity291 ' so that you can be a better person for the ultimate upliftment of those around you			2
no matter how many people say that they ' love ' you , if you do not love your person then you will never step outside of the physical you			1
the physical you can only do so much if your mental you is lost inside of all the confusion			1
and the presence of your mental you felt			0
its that culmination of your person that will leave a legacy and uplift			2
i hope that you have the most amazing vd and that you are spoilt with love and roses and chocolates			2
go home and tell your parents , siblings , neighbours that they are appreciated			1
you will go to bed with a happy heart and open mind for the future			0
