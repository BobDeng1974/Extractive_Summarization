not happy : @entity0 criticized @entity1 for running the faked interview @entity0 has lashed out at a golf magazine which published a ' below the belt ' fake interview with him			1
woods described the parody piece in @entity1 - which featured photographs of a professional lookalike - as a ' grudge - fueled piece of character assassination '			1
in the piece an outlandish parody of the champion golfer plays up to his worst stereotypes - and says the five best golfers of all time are all him			2
the article - entitled @entity18 * , with the subtitle ' ( or how it plays out in my mind ) was written by respected golf journalist @entity23 for the magazine 's december 2014 issue			1
it includes segments where the fake voice of @entity0 waxes lyrical about his love of firing everybody close to him , and seems to have no idea who his longtime friend and ally @entity33 even is			2
the comedy persona also takes on @entity0 's reputation for being a lousy tipper , and suggests waiters should ' get a better job '			2
towards the end of the interview , @entity42 also takes the unusual step of naming himself as all five entries in a list of the best golfers of all time			0
the character said : ' i rank me at @entity52 in 2000 first , me in the ' 97 masters second , me at @entity54 in 2000 third , me at @entity55 in 2006 fourth , and me at @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 fifth ... pick a year			0
' however , the real @entity0 failed to see the funny side of the piece , and tried to get even writing a blog post attacking @entity1 's journalism			1
he began : ' did you read @entity23 ’ interview with me in the latest @entity1 ? i hope not			2
' because it was n’t me			0
it was some jerk he created to pretend he was talking to me			0
' he continued : ' all athletes know that we will be under scrutiny from the media			0
but this concocted article was below the belt			0
' good - natured satire is one thing , but no fair - minded writer would put someone in the position of having to publicly deny that he mistreats his friends , takes pleasure in firing people , and stiffs on tips - and a lot of other slurs , too			1
' @entity0 added that he and his agent have written to @entity1 demanding an explanation - though editors of the magazine have already responded by reiterating that their article is a clearly - marked parody			1
' below the belt ' : @entity0 wrote an angry blog post about the non-interview , which was trailed on the cover ( bottom center )			0

woods lashed out at article in latest issue of @entity1 magazine
was entitled @entity18 * - but still drew player 's anger
in the piece a parody @entity0 talks about firing people and not *paying* tips
also says that he should be slots 1 - 5 in *history* 's five best golfers
woods *hit* out at the *portrayal* as ' some jerk ' who does not *resemble* him
