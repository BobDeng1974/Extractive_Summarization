by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell the @entity1 are exploring the possibility of introducing the vanishing spray that was implemented at the @entity4 to much success			1
head of officiating in @entity8 @entity7 , who attended @entity9 2014 , has been asked for a report on the spray ’s suitability to the top - flight			1
it was seen as a positive addition to matches at the @entity4 , used by referees to draw lines for defensive walls to stop encroachment as well as around the dead ball to prevent attackers moving it nearer goal			1
for the time being nothing has been ruled out or in by those in charge at the @entity1 , who still need to establish what domestic referees think , whether there is a desperate need , and how much time it may add to the game			1
even if reports are favourable , it is unlikely the spray will be used next season			2
thin white line vanishing spray to mark out free - kicks has been used at the @entity4 meanwhile , @entity42 , 43 , the man who invented the , is set to reap the financial rewards after years in poverty and facing bankruptcy			1
@entity42 told the @entity46 that seeing the spray being used for the first time at the @entity4 was a ' magical moment ' and added : ' i dedicated 14 years of my life to this idea			1
' after the referee brought it out the first time i started receiving text messages from my family and friends			2
' it was the first time i got emotional , my eyes welled up			0
i remember thinking , '' i ’m not crazy			0
it was all worth it "			0
' @entity42 grew up as one of five children living in a crowded three - bedroom house in @entity65 , a small town between @entity66 and @entity67			2
in the air : the @entity1 is expected to discuss with clubs whether to use it in action : the spray stops defensive walls from encroaching too far forward ' we all slept together in one small room			1
i never had any toys and we had few clothes			0
my parents sent me out to work at the age of eight			0
but now , @entity42 acknowledges he is set to make a lot of money if his product is adopted globally			1
' i hope that whatever financial gain is comparable to my 14 years of struggle			0
i ’ve paid a high price			0
i chose not to see my children grow up so that i could make this work			2
' he continued : ' @entity90 , though , i hope to have contributed to football – that we now have a tool that will help referees to keep order , help free kick takers score more goals , and improve the experience of football for everyone			0

vanishing spray was *hugely* successful during the @entity4
the foam has been used to make sure defensive walls do not encroach
@entity42 worked with a company to *concoct* the spray from *vegetable* *oil* derivatives
the spray is being considered for use in the @entity1
head of officiating @entity7 will provide a report on spray *'s* suitability
