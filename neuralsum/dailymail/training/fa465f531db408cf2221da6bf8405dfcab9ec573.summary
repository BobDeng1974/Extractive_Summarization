it may seem unlikely , but the humble rabbit helped kill off the @entity3 , researchers have claimed			1
experts have long thought that the demise of the @entity3 was down to food			1
now a new theory claims that it was their inability to adapt to hunting small animals like rabbits that was the final nail in their coffin			1
is this what killed the @entity3 ? researchers believe an inability to hunt small animals like rabbits led to their demise @entity18 , of the @entity19 in @entity20 , counted the skeletons of animals found in three excavation sites in @entity24 and southern @entity25			1
the remains of large animals such as deer that had been dated as far back as 30,000 years ago were abundant in caves			1
but from then on , coinciding with the disappearance of @entity3 , rabbit remains became more prevalent			1
as deer ran out , experts believe the @entity3 were unable to learn how to hunt small animals , and died out as modern man was better able to adapt the authors believe that humans were more successful at switching to catching and eating rabbits			1
' high dependence on the hunting and consumption of large mammals by some hominins may have limited their survival once their preferred quarry became scarce or disappeared , ' he wrote			0
' adaptation to smaller residual prey would have been essential after the many large - bodied species decreased in numbers			0
' the researchers focused on the rabbit , described as a ' super-abundant species '			0
' analysis of bone remains from excavations throughout @entity57 show that this lagomorph was a crucial part of the diet of @entity61 but was relatively unutilised during the @entity62 , when @entity3 were present , ' they found			2
' we suggest that hunters that could shift focus to rabbits and other smaller residual fauna , once larger - bodied species decreased in numbers , would have been able to persist			0
' however , the team admit it is not clear why @entity3 would have had more trouble changing prey			2
some believe they may have been less able to cooperate			0
rather than using spears , early humans probably surrounded a warren and flushed out rabbits with fire , smoke or dogs , it is believed			1
neanderthals and the ancestors of modern humans never co-existed , according to a recent study which , if correct , could rewrite conventional accounts of our species ' early history			2
the study suggests that our evolutionary cousins became extinct in their last refuge in @entity24 much earlier than previously thought			0
previous dating of bone fossils found at @entity3 sites in the region put the youngest at about 35,000 years			2
now researchers from @entity100 and @entity101 have re-examined the bones using an improved method to filter out contamination and concluded that the remains are actually about 15,000 years older			0
if true , the study casts doubt on the idea that modern humans and @entity3 co-existed - and possibly even interbred - for millennia			1
humans are n't believed to have settled in the region until 42,000 years ago , but the new dating has neanderthals disappearing from there around 50,000 years ago			0
' the results of our study suggest that there are major problems with the dating of the last neanderthals in modern - day @entity24 , ' said @entity124 , deputy director of the @entity125 at @entity126			0
' it is unlikely that @entity3 survived any later in this area than they did elsewhere in mainland @entity101			0

researchers believe @entity3 failed to adapt to hunting small animals once deer *population* *dwindled*
believed early humans were able to adapt and *prosper* by eating small animals
