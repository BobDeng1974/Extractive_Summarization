by @entity0 @entity1 demanded new rights for @entity3 to restrict handouts to @entity6 migrants in @entity7 today @entity1 opened up a new front in the @entity10 battle with @entity11 last night , demanding new rights for @entity3 to restrict welfare handouts for @entity6 migrants			1
the @entity14 made a provocative speech in @entity7 in which he hit out at the @entity16 for telling us ‘ we will have to pay benefits to anyone who comes here from @entity22 , regardless of their circumstances ’ , and that doing otherwise is ‘ akin to xenophobia ’			1
he said the government had already banned new migrants from claiming housing benefit and stopped them from getting unemployment or family support until they have been living in the @entity3 for at least three months			2
migrants without work are also now required to prove they can speak @entity34 and that they will be able to get a job in order to claim			0
but mr @entity1 said @entity3 wanted to go further , and demanded ‘ the right to say to migrants that we require a much longer record of commitment before you get benefits and shortening the duration of any benefit claim that is allowed ’			1
he condemned @entity6 interference in the @entity3 welfare system as ‘ unwarranted and unwanted ’ and said it should abandon its efforts to hold up a series of further welfare reforms he would like to make with a ‘ constant stream ’ of legal challenges			1
meanwhile @entity11 officials came under attack from senior @entity59 – even europhile deputy prime minister @entity60 – for ‘ lecturing ’ @entity3 on its economic policy , despite growth here far outpacing that of struggling eurozone countries			2
@entity67 mayor @entity66 said the @entity16 could ‘ take a running jump ’ over one proposal for the @entity3 to impose higher property taxes on owners of expensive homes			1
mr @entity60 said @entity11 should concentrate on cutting red tape and regulation for businesses , rather than delivering ‘ lectures ’ to the @entity3			0
mr @entity1 insisted @entity3 ‘ strongly believes that the @entity6 must change ’			1
mr @entity60 said @entity11 should concentrate on cutting red tape and regulation for businesses , rather than delivering ¿ lectures ¿ to the @entity3 today he said the government wanted to end the ‘ absurdity of paying family benefits to workers who have moved country , yet whose children remain back at home , at a rate that bears little relation to the level of benefits in the country where the children actually live ’			0
and he complained that the @entity6 ‘ wrongly cites the freedom of movement as a justification for interfering with our national welfare system , telling us we will have to pay benefits to anyone who comes here from @entity22 , regardless of their circumstances … and that to do otherwise is ... akin to “ xenophobia ”			1
he added : ‘ if we fail to change ... then we run the risk of damaging the reputation of free movement altogether			0
’ @entity109 chancellor @entity108 reportedly asked the @entity111 government if it would put forward @entity112 – who is currently head of the @entity113 – to be the next president of the @entity16			1
the appointment would be seen as a great victory for @entity117 in its efforts to prevent so - called ‘ mr @entity120 ’ @entity119 from getting the job			0
@entity3 pay higher property taxes than people living in any other developed country , according to new figures			0
property taxes in the @entity3 represent 4.2 per cent of the country ’s total economic output , the @entity127 revealed			2
the average in the @entity127 is 1.8 per cent			0
the revelation makes a mockery of @entity16 calls for new property and land levies to hit more expensive homes in @entity3			2
the @entity138 ’ @entity137 said : ‘ the housing market is already over-taxed			0
the answer is planning reform , not headline - grabbing wealth taxes			0

@entity1 hitting out at @entity16 during speech in @entity7
demanded new rights for @entity3 to restrict welfare handouts of @entity6 migrants
condemned @entity6 interference in @entity3 welfare system as ' unwarranted '
@entity154 ’s efforts to block an arch *federalist* from a top @entity6 job were *bolstered* last night after a senior @entity111 politician was put in the frame for the post .
