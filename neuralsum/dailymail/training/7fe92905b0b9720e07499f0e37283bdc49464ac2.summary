on @entity2 ’s left wrist there is a tattoo of a young boy wearing a no 10 shirt and looking longingly at @entity6			1
@entity2 grew up on the mean streets of the notorious @entity9 estate and used to ride his bike with his mates to @entity6 market on a sunday morning			1
in the shadow of the new stadium they would play football in the car parks and dream of growing up to represent their country at a @entity20			2
last saturday , in @entity21 , @entity2 slipped on the shirt for real			2
‘ the stadium was literally round the corner and i ’ve always wanted to play for @entity25 and be the best i can be			2
‘ i grew up five minutes away from the stadium			0
i used to ride my bike around this little car park and i used to say to myself , “ one day , when this stadium is built , i ’d like to play in there ”			0
i am really grateful to be given that opportunity			0
’ @entity2 impressed against @entity43 after he was thrust into the role just behind @entity45 during @entity25 ’s opening group game			1
it was @entity2 ’s pass out to @entity49 on the left that began the move which led to @entity45 ’s 37th - minute equaliser in the @entity53			1
‘ every time i had the ball there were about three players around me , ’ he said			0
@entity43 recognised his qualities from the off			2
youngster : @entity2 has enjoyed a quick rise to the top after climbing through the ranks at @entity65 all smiles : @entity2 shares a joke with @entity25 team - mate @entity68 during training @entity2 made an impressive start to his @entity20 against @entity43			1
the youngster had four shots at goal , more than any other @entity25 player			1
as his confidence grew in the second half , he even sprinted back nearly 40 yards to cheekily dispossess the great @entity77 when he was idling on the ball just outside @entity25 ’s penalty area			2
‘ i knew it was him on the ball and i will do anything for my team if it is something that i need to do , ’ he added matter - of - factly			2
‘ to take it off such a good player is something i needed to do , but in the first half there was no point pressing him because he is so good he would just bounce around the corner			0
’ @entity2 shows no inhibitions and this streetwise kid is ready for the next phase of his international career against @entity24 on thursday in @entity97			1
the @entity25 forward can make things happen and he has come a long way since his @entity101 manager @entity100 barked out ‘ @entity2 - if you say " steady " one more time you ’ll be on the first flight home ’ in the @entity105 documentary being : @entity65 in the summer of 2012			1
two years on , after a brilliant second half of the season alongside @entity45 and @entity108 , he knows the qualities required to stay at the top of his game			1
@entity112 : @entity2 put in a lively performance during @entity25 's defeat against @entity43 @entity2 takes defeat personally and was so distraught after the game with @entity43 that he could not even respond to his mum ’s text message			1
‘ before the game she told me to relax and not to put too much pressure on myself , or beat myself up , ’ he added			0
‘ after the game , she dropped me a text and knew i would n’t reply until the next day because we lost , but she told me to get over it as quickly as possible			0
‘ she said i had to make everyone in the country proud , not just my family			0
’ he did that with an enterprising and energetic performance in his first full @entity25 start			2
now the stage is set			0
@entity2 has no inhibitions , playing fearlessly and enjoying the experience of life at a @entity20 as an @entity25 international			1
in the hole : @entity49 ( left ) could play in his favoured no 10 role against @entity24 ‘ i ’m young and i ’m learning , but i ’ve got a lot to learn and i ’ve got to grow up , ’ he added			1
‘ i do worry about stuff , but i ’m learning every day and have people around me guiding me in the right way , ’ he added			0
on tuesday his @entity25 team - mate @entity143 , who has been acting as his chaperone , spoke highly of the young @entity65 forward			1
@entity143 turns 36 on friday and has seen it all as an international , good and bad , during his distinguished career			0
reds : @entity2 will come up against his @entity65 team - mate @entity108 on thursday @entity149 : @entity108 ‘ @entity2 is instinctive , he can think on the pitch at the last second because of his ability and pace , ’ claimed @entity143			1
‘ @entity2 is not the sort of kid walking around now as if he runs the hotel behind the scenes just because he ’s been playing well			2
‘ it is such a goldfish bowl , but he has to live his own life			0
it sounds like his mother ’s very strong with him and that will always help			0
he wo n’t want to upset her too much			0
we all need one of those			0
’ @entity143 was particularly close to his late mother , @entity168 , and his advice to @entity2 on tuesday was striking			2
the youngster , to his credit , listened intently			0
impressed : @entity25 veteran @entity143 says @entity2 is an instinctive footballer as he did when captain @entity172 put an arm round him after the red card @entity2 received against @entity175 during the build - up game in @entity177 , for a reckless challenge on @entity179			1
that indiscretion is all in the past , @entity24 is all that counts now			0
@entity25 face @entity108 and his pals in a game @entity184 simply can not afford to lose			1
@entity25 ’s head coach gambled by shifting @entity49 out to the left against the @entity187 to accommodate @entity2 in a central role after his eye - catching performances on the training ground			1
in charge : @entity184 looks on during a training session at the @entity194 military base on monday ‘ the manager thought at the time that playing me in the middle was the best thing to do , ’ explained @entity2			2
‘ but i do n’t think the team was built around me			0
i do n’t think he changed anything for me			0
’ it was a modest response , but this @entity20 is made for players like @entity2 .			1
