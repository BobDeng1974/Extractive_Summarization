@entity1 ’s comet is a unique , multi-faceted world that features huge cliffs , plunging craters and house - sized boulders			2
now a colourful map revealing its stunning landscape has been created by mission scientists in @entity10 following data sent back from the probe			1
the map is expected to help researchers pick a suitable place to drop a lander in november – the first time a landing on a comet has ever been attempted			1
the map was used to help researchers pick a suitable place to drop a lander in november the map shows @entity33 ’s ‘ continents ’ based on the variations on the comet ’s surface			1
various areas are dominated by cliffs , depressions , craters , boulders and even parallel grooves , with some regions still being shaped by the comet ’s activity			0
as both @entity47 and @entity1 travel closer to the sun over the next months , the mission control team will monitor the surface looking for changes			1
while the scientists do n’t expect the borderlines of the comet ’s regions to vary dramatically , more subtle transformations could help explain more about how comets form			1
jagged cliffs and prominent boulders are visible in this image taken by on 5 september 2014 from a distance of 39 miles ( 62km ) from comet @entity33			1
the left part of the image shows a side view of the comet 's ' body ' , while the right is the back of its ' head '			1
one pixel corresponds to 3.6ft ( 1.1 metres ) next weekend , on 13 and 14 september , the maps will play a key role as @entity1 ’s @entity72 and the @entity1 orbiter scientists to decide where they will park the @entity76 lander			1
an announcement on their decision will be made on 15 september			1
once @entity76 leaves @entity1 to head for @entity81 , there will be no chance to alter its path			0
it will take between five and eight hours to reach the comet ’s surface and be pulled in by its weak gravity			1
earlier this week , @entity1 has uncovered some surprising features about comet @entity33			0
instead of imaging a bright , ice - covered comet , the probe ’s instruments have detected that @entity47 is in fact darker than charcoal in some wavelengths of light			2
and scientists working on @entity1 ’s @entity99 instrument have so far failed to find any large patches of water - ice on @entity47 ’s surface			2
an artist 's impression of the @entity105 at comet @entity33			0
instead of imaging a bright , ice - covered comet , the probe ’s instruments have detected that @entity47 is in fact darker than charcoal @entity1 has measured the temperature of the comet and determined that its average surface temperature is about -70 ° @entity112 )			1
although it may seem cold , that is actually 20 to @entity114 ( 36 to 54 ° f ) warmer than predicted for a comet at that distance , suggesting its surface will be quite dusty in addition to being icy			2
' this result is very interesting , since it gives us the first clues on the composition and physical properties of the comet ’s surface , ' says @entity128 principal investigator @entity127 from @entity129 , @entity130			2
this suggests that much of the surface must be dusty , because darker material heats up and emits heat more readily than ice			0
‘ we 're a bit surprised at just how unreflective the comet 's surface is and how little evidence of exposed water - ice it shows , ’ said @entity136 , @entity99 principal investigator at the @entity137 in @entity138			2
scientists had previously believed the comet ’s surface would contain ice because it was too far away for the sun ’s warmth to melt it			1
the lack of ice could suggest that the comet had been in close with our sun , or a different star , at some point during its journey in deep space			0
they also found that the ' coma ' - or atmosphere - around the comet contains of hydrogen and oxygen			0
this is surprising as comas are generally thought to be composed of water vapour and dust			0
described as ‘ the sexiest , most fantastic mission ever ’ , @entity1 will spend more than a year analysing the comet to help uncover the secrets to life on @entity172			2
the comet itself is about 2.5 miles ( 4km ) long and orbits the sun every six - and - a - half years			0
it is heading towards the sun , so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more			0
for a sense of scale , the comet is about three times the size of @entity183 and @entity1 is the size of a car with 105ft ( 32 metre ) wings			0
zoom in on the image below to find out where @entity1 is at the moment five sites were identified on @entity191 during the @entity193 meeting held 23 – 24 august			0
the approximate locations of the five regions are marked on these @entity197 narrow - angle camera images taken on 16 august from a distance of about 62 miles ( 100km )			0

map created by scientists in @entity10 with data sent back from probe
it will help researchers choose an area to drop lander in november
the mission control team will monitor the surface looking for changes
@entity215 zones for a landing on comet will be unveiled on 15 september
