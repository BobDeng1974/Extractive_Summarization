by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 18:16 est , 16 december 2012 diverse : a study has found 153 languages are spoken in @entity4 its detractors try to portray it as a cold , wet and sometimes insular place			1
but @entity4 is actually one of the most exotic cities in the world , researchers claim			0
this is due to its cultural diversity , with at least 153 languages spoken			1
two - thirds of @entity4 school children are bilingual , with the number of languages likely to increase , according to the study by @entity20			1
the city is more diverse than @entity22 , and rivalled only by @entity23 and @entity24 for its ethnic and linguistic mix , claims professor @entity26 , who carried out the research			1
‘ @entity4 ’s language diversity is higher than many countries in the world , ’ professor @entity26 said			0
‘ it is very likely to be the top of the list in @entity35 , certainly when compared to other cities of its size			0
’ with a population of 500,000 , @entity4 is much smaller than @entity22 , where more than 300 languages are spoken by eight million inhabitants			2
professor @entity26 said : ‘ there are certainly a greater number of languages spoken in @entity22 but these are by people who are passing through – diplomats , businessmen , etc – but in @entity4 , the foreign language speakers are residents			1
‘ around two - thirds of @entity4 school children are bilingual – a huge figure which indicates just how precious its linguistic culture is			2
as immigration and the arrival of overseas students to the city continues , it ’s fair to say that this already large list is set to grow			2
’ @entity4 ’s rapid growth began during the @entity60 , with the city ’s textile trade attracting workers from across the empire , setting the pattern for diversity			0
the policy of recruiting from abroad for public services , such as the @entity70 , has helped bring in some of the more obscure languages , the professor says			0
@entity4 is famous for its football teams , @entity72 and @entity73 , managed by sir @entity74 ( left ) and @entity75 ( right ) respectively , but now has a new claim to fame @entity4 is also known for producing stars like former @entity80 frontman @entity79 these include more than a dozen @entity83 languages , ten from @entity84 , three @entity86 dialects , various forms of the @entity89 language of @entity91 gypsies , @entity92 – which is spoken by the @entity94 of north - west @entity95 – and even @entity96 , the tongue of the ancient @entity98 of @entity99			1
professor @entity26 said the @entity101 data released last week underestimated the number of multi-lingual households in the @entity104 , as respondents were asked to name their main language			0
‘ most multi-linguals speak a language other than @entity109 at home , but use @entity109 at work , in their place of study , so they will answer that @entity109 is their main language , even though this is not strictly accurate			0
