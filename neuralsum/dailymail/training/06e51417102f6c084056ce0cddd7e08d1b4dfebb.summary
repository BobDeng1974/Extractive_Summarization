there is a narrative arc in every @entity2 that sees the two protagonists enjoy an initial spark , fall - out over some unforeseen development , then get back together with a bang			2
it ’s a little like that with @entity9 and form right now			1
their season showed blossoming signs with 10 points from four games , capped by @entity17 ’s winner at @entity18			1
but since then it has been the cold shoulder treatment ; four successive defeats and no goals			1
monday night ’s match against @entity23 presents the opportunity for their relationship with points to be rekindled			1
and in front of the cameras , for added cinematic effect			0
@entity17 celebrates after scoring against @entity31 in the final match of their impressive start @entity17 netted a late winner to ensure @entity9 gained 10 points from their first four matches the coming encounter marks the end of a horrific run of fixtures that saw @entity9 play each of last season ’s top five teams			1
victory at @entity31 in the first of those , following wins over @entity48 and @entity49 and a draw with @entity51 , added gloss to a solid campaign start			0
successive defeats to @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 have though brought dawning realisation that this may yet turn into another difficult season			1
@entity9 were second favourites in each of those encounters so it is no surprise they failed to emerge with anything			1
rather it is the manner of some performances which heightens the importance of the match at @entity68			2
since their impressive start , @entity9 have struggled with four defeats in a row in their four successive defeats , @entity9 have not scored a goal ... @entity74 is pictured netting against them @entity76 scored the second @entity56 goal in a 3 - 0 defeat over @entity9 in september it is 441 minutes since @entity17 poked in from close range to defeat @entity31			1
never before have @entity9 gone five consecutive @entity83 matches without scoring			1
even during the good times this lack of creativity was a concern			0
@entity9 amassed their ten points through just four goals and six shots on target			1
since then they have worked the opposition goalkeeper with shots another six occasions in total			0
it is a paucity that needs addressing			0
as we saw against @entity31 , @entity23 are a team who can do your work for you			2
aiming for the feet of @entity104 and @entity105 with crosses is one tactic , sure			0
but @entity108 can not rely on such generosity			0
@entity110 ( left ) and @entity108 ( right ) now have the job of getting @entity9 's season back on track @entity9 's form has been like a film script - they enjoyed the initial period , but have hit a snag in recent weeks @entity9 must now reignite their season , beginning with their trip to @entity23 on monday night @entity120 started at @entity121 but is clearly a way off reaching his physical peak			1
@entity9 badly missed the energy and forward momentum @entity125 provides from midfield			2
it may be a tactical tweak is required to generate greater attacking thrust			0
the diamond might do it , positioning both @entity120 and @entity17 as strikers , twinning strength with pace , and having @entity136 in behind			0
the midfielder was at his best for @entity138 operating in and around the box , playing one - twos to unlock defences , before recent seasons saw him further withdrawn			0
it would mean @entity145 sitting , supported by wingers @entity147 , adept at defending , and either @entity148 or @entity149 , inclined to attack			0
given @entity148 ’s performances of late it may be time to hand the 19 - year - old his first start			0
it would be a departure from @entity108 ’s trusted 4 - 3 - 3 formation and a defensive risk given the groin injury to @entity159 – he provided excellent organisaion alongside @entity161 for the first three games – but it might be equally dangerous to continue as it is			2
@entity23 , for all the subsequent flabgate fallout , showed enough against @entity31 to suggest @entity68 under the floodlights can be the setting for a twist in the script .			2

@entity9 started the season with 10 points from their first four matches
since then , they have endured four successive defeats without scoring
monday 's match against @entity23 is an opportunity to reignite their season
@entity9 have never gone five @entity83 games without a goal
