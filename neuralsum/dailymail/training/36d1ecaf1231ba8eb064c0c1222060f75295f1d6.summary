the world ’s largest offshore wind farm has been given the go - ahead to be built in @entity4 waters			1
energy secretary @entity5 has granted planning permission for the ambitious scheme – which could cost bill payers more than £ 10.5billion in green subsidies			1
the plan is for 400 turbines to be erected in a giant grid structure 80 miles off the @entity14 coast , covering 430sq miles in the area known as @entity16			1
growth : the new windfarm off the @entity14 coast would dwarf this one , @entity19 , off @entity20 the plan is for 400 turbines to be erected in a giant grid structure 80 miles off the @entity14 coast , covering 430sq miles in the area known as @entity16 the @entity24 wind farms would be more than twice the size of the @entity26 , currently the world ’s biggest offshore wind farm			1
the turbines are expected to power 1.8million homes – about 2.5 per cent of @entity4 ’s entire electricity requirement			1
the building costs of the project are estimated at up to £ 8billion , which will be paid by @entity35 , an international consortium of energy companies @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			2
but if the plan is approved for inclusion in the government ’s subsidy scheme , @entity42 , the firms could expect to make their money back within a decade because it would guarantee them a fixed price for the electricity they produce			1
the decision on inclusion in the @entity42 will be made by 2017 by whoever is energy secretary at the time , and then @entity35 will decide whether to begin construction or not			2
if the consortium is granted access to the programme , which is funded through a green subsidy on energy bills , it can expect to receive an estimated £ 700million a year – or £ 10.5billion over the 15 years of guaranteed funding			2
dr @entity62 , director of @entity63 , which calculated the figures , said the size of the project is so big that it could alter the shape of the @entity4 economy			0
he said : ‘ the @entity24 offshore wind farm would receive about £ 700million a year , and all drawn from consumer bills			0
' additional energy costs on this scale will affect the course of @entity4 economic history , and not for the better			2
the last time public subsidies on this scale were directed towards a single industry it was called @entity79			0
arguably , not a good omen			0
’ and the scheme could still grow even bigger , with a decision on a second project , @entity84 , expected in august			0
@entity85 , general manager of @entity35 , claimed that @entity24 could create up to 4,750 jobs over its 25 - year lifespan			0
@entity89 mr @entity5 said : ‘ making the most of @entity4 ’s homegrown energy is creating jobs and businesses in the @entity4 , getting the best deal for consumers and reducing our reliance on foreign imports			1
wind power is vital to this plan , with £ 14.5billion invested since 2010 into an industry which supports 35,400 jobs			2
’ energy secretary @entity5 ( pictured ) has granted planning permission for the ambitious scheme – which could cost bill payers more than £ 10.5billion in green subsidies the government is keen to expand the number of offshore wind farms because they do not attract the same local opposition as onshore projects			1
however , the offshore alternatives come at a price			0
every wind turbine built at sea costs bill payers an extra £ 300,000 a year in public subsidies , according to the @entity117			1
the @entity118 has estimated that green subsidies made up £ 45 of the average £ 1,140 dual gas and electricity bill in 2013			1
this will rise to £ 100 by 2020 , and £ 175 by 2030 , by which time the total average bill will be £ 1,305			0
there are 1,200 offshore wind turbines in @entity4 waters today			2
the government wants 3,000 by 2020			0
a @entity129 spokesman said : said : ‘ any estimates about possible @entity127 support for @entity16 are pure baseless speculation			0
the cost of offshore wind is already coming down rapidly ; and we are introducing auctions for government support to drive the costs down even further			0

energy secretary @entity5 granted planning permission for the scheme
the plan is for 400 turbines to be erected 80 miles off the @entity14 coast
it is set to power 1.8million homes - 2.5 *%* of @entity4 ’s electricity requirement
huge scheme could cost bill payers more than £ 10.5bn in green subsidies
