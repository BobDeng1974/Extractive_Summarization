the renowned sports psychiatrist dr @entity0 claims he did little more than give @entity1 the tools to rebuild his @entity4 career			1
@entity5 batsman @entity1 touched down in the @entity6 with @entity4 on thursday night , back in the international set - up for the first time since leaving last winter 's @entity10 tour with a stress - related illness			1
@entity1 has spoken openly of his struggles since , but has slowly rehabilitated his career with both @entity5 and the @entity15 and is now on the brink of returning to @entity17			1
@entity1 returns to the @entity4 set - up for the first time since taking a break with a stress - related illness the 33 - year - old has worked extensively with dr @entity0 during the last year , learning from a man who has done notable work with the @entity28 cycling team , @entity27 and @entity29 , and who introduced the ' @entity31 ' in a bid to help people better manage their own minds			1
but speaking in @entity35 , @entity0 said there is no magic cure and that @entity1 had worked hard to counter his problems , which he described as ' situational anxiety '			1
he wrote : ' he ticked all the boxes			0
it was a foregone conclusion to me that he would make massive progress - i just hoped that he would then perform as he has been doing and justify his place			2
now he has done that			0
dr @entity0 worked with the batsman and gave him the necessary tools to return to the game ' he 's an incredible cricketer			1
the advice i give to most of the people i work with is not to go public because obviously you 're training people to do a skill			0
a lot of people do n't understand it is a skill and therefore you might not get it right			0
' people are expecting a magic - wand cure and that 's not really the way it works			2
@entity1 decided he wanted to go public about this because he has done so well			2
' it 's a credit to the man			0
you can have periods in sport , sometimes a whole season , when things just are n't happening and you 're just digging even harder to make it happen again - that 's effectively what @entity1 has done			1
@entity1 has impressed since returning for @entity5 and the @entity15 , earning his return to the squad ' from a psychological point of view , @entity1 is quite robust and certainly determined			1
it was just a case of giving him the tools to understand what was going on			0
' @entity0 , who helped mentor the golden generation of @entity28 cyclists and also worked with @entity29 for his last two world titles , can see no reason why @entity1 will not make a successful return to test cricket			1
' what @entity1 did was to take it very seriously , he meant business , which is a measure of the man , ' he added			2
@entity0 ( left ) has worked with @entity27 , @entity29 and the @entity4 football team in recent years ' he was very open , hard - working , and what i effectively told him to do was to get some insights into the way his mind was working			1
then it was up to him to operate [ his mind ] in the way he wanted it to , rather than it dictating to him what was going happen			0
' i do n't have a recipe for people			0
it 's up to the player himself to manage the mind in the way they want to in the future			0
that 's something anyone can do , it 's not something you only do when you 're distressed			0
@entity1 had what became a situational anxiety , and once that was understood , he was able to manage it			2
' my feeling is that he 'll do very well and he wo n't have any problems now because he has that insight			0
' @entity1 reacts while bowling during a friendly match at @entity123 , @entity124 during his comeback			2

@entity1 returned to @entity4 's set - up after his stress - related illness
sport psychiatrist dr @entity0 helped the batsman with his problems
@entity0 is *delighted* to see the ' incredible ' @entity1 return for @entity4
