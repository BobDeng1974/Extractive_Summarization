president @entity0 is on pace this year to deport the fewest number of immigrants since at least 2007 , even as he has postponed until after @entity4 his promised unilateral action that could shield millions more from deportation			1
according to an analysis of @entity9 figures by @entity10 , the federal agency responsible for deportations sent home 258,608 immigrants between the start of the budget year last october and july 28 this summer			2
during the same period a year earlier , it removed 320,167 people — meaning this year saw a decrease in deportations by nearly 20 percent			1
data obtained from the @entity9 shows that @entity0 is on pace this year to deport the fewest number of immigrants since at least 2007 over the same period ending in july 2012 , @entity28 deported 344,624 people , some 25 percent more than this year , according to the federal figures obtained by the @entity10 the figures , contained in weekly internal reports marked ' @entity33 only , ' reflect the marked decline in deportations even as @entity0 has delayed announcing what changes he will make to @entity38 immigration policies through executive action			1
@entity0 had said he would act before the end of the summer , but @entity24 officials said last weekend that the president would postpone his decision until after november 's elections much to the chagrin of @entity47 leaders , many of whom believe @entity0 's deported too many immigrants since taking office , @entity0 's administration has removed more than 2.1 million immigrants			1
there are several reasons why fewer immigrants already are being deported			1
first , the president directed the @entity9 in the summer of 2011 to focus deportation efforts on criminal immigrants or those who posed a threat to national security or public safety			2
many others who crossed into the @entity38 illegally and could be subject to deportation are stuck in a federal immigration court system			1
last month the backlog in that system exceeded 400,000 cases for the first time , according to court data analyzed by the @entity72 at @entity73			0
for each case , it now takes as many as four years for a judge to issue a final order to leave the @entity38 as @entity79 agents detain more people from countries in @entity82 , not @entity83 , the volume and circumstances of the cases take more time for overwhelmed immigration officials and courts to process because , among other reasons , the @entity38 must fly such immigrants home rather than letting them walk back across the border into @entity83			1
a surge in the number of immigrant families , mostly women and young children , has swamped temporary holding facilities , leading the @entity9 to release many people into the @entity38 interior with instructions to report back to authorities later			1
amid the crush of immigrant families and children caught traveling alone across the border , homeland security secretary @entity104 has promised that most will be sent home			2
' those who cross our border illegally must know there is no safe passage and no free pass , ' @entity104 said in july			0
' within the confines of our laws , our values and our resources , they will be sent back to their home countries			0
' as of early september , only 319 of more than 59,000 immigrants who were caught traveling with their families have been returned to @entity82			1
a @entity126 and @entity127 patrols the @entity83 border near @entity129 , @entity83 last friday			0
the @entity24 said today that the tumbling deportation numbers could be related to the amount of resources going toward border security asked for comment , @entity28 spokeswoman @entity134 told the @entity10 that the agency has not released removal numbers for this budget year and officials are ' still assessing a number of factors that inform @entity28 's ability to remove individuals			1
' ' @entity28 remains focused on smart and effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the removal of convicted criminals and recent border entrants , ' @entity134 said in a statement			0
also , under @entity38 law , immigrant children from @entity82 caught crossing the border alone ca n't be subjected to speedy removal proceedings without appearing before a judge			1
the government interviews @entity156 and @entity157 children to make sure they are n't trafficking victims , then send home quickly			0
a 2008 law disallows immigration officials from treating illegal children from other countries the same way			2
questioned about the falling deportation numbers at a daily press briefing , @entity24 press secretary @entity165 said that deportation decisions are made by law enforcement officers at @entity9			0
' this is not something that is mandated by the @entity24 , ' he said , moments before acknowledging that the president had directed @entity9 to shift it 's resources to the humanitarian situation at the border			0
' the shifting of those resources may have something to do with those numbers , ' @entity165 admitted			0
@entity165 was also asked about potential actions @entity0 could take to slow deportations down further			0
the @entity0 spokesman said that ' most of the work has been completed ' on @entity0 's immigration plans , ' and we are positioned to make an announcement before the end of the year			1
' he said those plans had not yet been finalized however , and the president was still meeting with his advisers to cross the t 's and dot the i 's			0
it remains unclear exactly what actions @entity0 will announce after the elections			0
the president said earlier this month the @entity38 would be better off if immigrants — who in some cases he said have been in the @entity38 for longer than 10 years and have @entity38 children — ' have a path to get legal by paying taxes and getting aboveboard , paying a fine , learning @entity203 if they have to			1
' but there are limits under @entity38 law to actions that @entity0 could take without approval from @entity209			1
he ca n't generally give large groups of immigrants blanket permission to remain permanently in the @entity38 , and he ca n't grant them @entity38 citizenship			2
he could delay indefinitely efforts to deport immigrants already in the @entity38 illegally , however , and he could give them official work permits that would allow them to legally find jobs , obtain driver 's licenses and file tax returns			2
the president said this month that a partisan fight in july over how to address a surge in the number of immigrant children caught crossing the border had created the impression that there was a crisis — and a volatile climate for taking the measures he had promised			2
the president sent his chief of staff to the @entity234 on thursday to reassure unhappy @entity47 lawmakers that he still plans to act by the end of the year			0
lawmakers say that some vented their anger during the meeting with @entity240 , who heard them out and pledged action			0
' we ’re going to fix it and we ’ll do it before the end of the year , ' @entity240 told reporters after the meeting , according to @entity247 .			0

the @entity38 has deported 20 percent fewer illegal immigrants this year than it did last year
@entity0 may shield millions of *additional* immigrants from deportation with an executive order later this year
the surge of unaccompanied @entity82 children at the border has contributed to low deportation rates this year
