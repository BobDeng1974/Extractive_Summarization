by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 sporting connections will loom large for @entity4 on friday afternoon as he faces @entity5 on the latest stage of his @entity8 odyssey			1
not only will the defending champion tackle the country ’s fourth - ranked player to try to make the last 16 , but @entity4 has also revealed that he has invested in the new film about the life of @entity3 icon @entity14 , which is released on friday			1
the 27 - year - old @entity17 , whose fortune is estimated at around £ 40million , has used some of that cash to back the biopic of the great golfer , partly for sentimental reasons ( and doubtless for some tax efficiency ) : ‘ i normally try to invest in something that interests me a little bit			0
i watched a lot of golf when i was younger , ’ he said			0
next up : @entity4 takes on @entity5 on friday afternoon ‘ i remember going to the tournament at glen - eagles , which was near us			1
i know my dad was a massive @entity14 fan – he loved watching him and used to talk about him a lot when we were growing up			1
i get asked about a number of investment opportunities and that was something to me that made sense			0
’ @entity4 ’s attempts at playing golf , never that wholehearted , have ground to a halt for now , as have his days of being a bandit : ‘ i stopped playing when i started having back problems			1
' when i used to play for money , i always used to play off 16 , everyone got p * * * * d off when i was playing against them			0
i have never lost a game of golf for money			0
i do n’t know what my handicap was exactly but that is what i used to play off			0
fan : @entity4 invested in the new film about the life of @entity14 ( above ) ‘ my brother @entity58 got down to three when he was 16 or 17			1
he does n’t play too much now			0
’ @entity4 will be far more preoccupied with tackling the world no 23 as he returns to @entity60 in his usual primetime slot of late afternoon			2
@entity5 has bloomed curiously late in his mid- 20s from being an unknown journeyman to entering the top 30 , and he presents a danger as he comes in having won last week ’s @entity67 event on grass in @entity69			2
the seven - match winning streak has seen him beat useful grass - court players such as @entity73 and @entity74 , and his game is more suited to the surface than many @entity3			2
in form : @entity5 is currently on a seven - match winning streak he will not hold too many surprises for @entity4 , as the pair know each other from training spells in @entity83 , where they have attended @entity85 matches together			1
in fact both had the chance to choose football over tennis when younger			0
‘ i was a striker at @entity91 and while nobody from my time at the club really made it , i know a lot of the players there just now , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ i made the right choice when i opted to become a tennis player although i think i would have more chance of beating @entity4 at football			2
‘ we practice quite a lot together and we always talk about football rather than tennis			0
’ practice : @entity5 and @entity4 ( above ) know each other well from training spells			1

@entity4 faces @entity5 at @entity8 on friday
pair know each other well from training *sessions*
