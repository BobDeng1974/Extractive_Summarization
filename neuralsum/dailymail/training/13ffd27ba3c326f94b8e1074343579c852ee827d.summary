health secretary @entity0 today defended the @entity2 reforms , amid reports senior @entity4 fear it is the biggest strategic mistake they have made in government ministers were today forced to defend the controversial overhaul of the @entity2 amid claims senior @entity4 believe it is the biggest mistake they have made in government			1
insiders described the reforms as ‘ unintelligible gobbledygook ’ which had been a ‘ huge strategic error ’ for the @entity18 ’s reputation for looking after the health service			1
as health workers went on strike over pay , health secretary @entity0 today insisted the changes had been ‘ very , very important ’ in saving money which could be used to hire more doctors and nurses			1
in opposition , the @entity4 promised there would be no top - down reorganisation of the @entity2			1
the controversial shake - up , which was not included in either @entity32 ’s manifesto , was drawn up by @entity33 , when he was the health secretary			1
one senior cabinet minister told @entity36 : ‘ we ’ve made three mistakes that i regret , the first being restructuring the @entity2			1
’ one ally of mr @entity41 , the chancellor , said : ‘ @entity42 kicks himself for not having spotted it and stopped it			2
he had the opportunity then and he did n’t take it			2
’ a former no 10 adviser said : ‘ no one apart from @entity33 had a clue what he was really embarking on , certainly not the prime minister			1
‘ he kept saying his grand plans had the backing of the medical establishment and we trusted him			0
in retrospect it was a mistake			0
’ the legislation was so badly written that it was amended some 2,000 times as it went through @entity58 , with even supporters of the original plans saying the final outcome bore little relation to mr @entity33 ’s vision			1
the @entity64 scrapped primary care trusts and put billions in spending in the hands of gp commissioning groups			0
it was originally claimed it would save £ 7.7billion , but it was later downgraded to £ 6billion			0
an investigation by @entity36 found that a study carried out for ministers has found that at least £ 5billion is wasted every year on inefficiencies , such as overpaying for supplies , out - of - date drugs , agency workers and empty buildings			2
two fifths of @entity2 chief executives told the paper that charges to see a gp or stay in hospital will be needed without extra money for the health service			1
strikers protest outside @entity93 in @entity94 in the first walkout since 1982 members of the armed forces today stepped in as more than 400,000 @entity2 staff staged their first walk out in more than 30 years , mounting picket lines outside hospitals			1
but it emerged only a fraction of workers who belong to unions taking part , voted to strike in the row over pay			1
fewer than half those balloted for the controversial health strike voted in favour of the action , the @entity109 can reveal			1
and @entity113 , one of the biggest unions , could persuade fewer than one in ten – 9.5 per cent – of eligible members to vote for the controversial walkout			2
none of the other six trade organisations involved managed to get a mandate from more than half of those balloted			0
yet 400,000 nurses , midwives , paramedics , specialist health staff and hospital porters and cleaners staged the walk out from 7am for four hours @entity2 workers strike outside @entity132 in central @entity133 in a dispute over pay the @entity36 also found that ‘ trolley waits ’ to get into hospital from @entity142 are running at almost three times the level of 2011 and the cost of bed blockers is at a record high			1
mr @entity0 told @entity143 ’s today programme : ‘ let ’s look at those reforms because they are very , very important			0
former health secretary @entity33 is blamed for forcing through the complex reforms ‘ what we are dealing with is an aging population , with cancer survival rates that we are trying to increase , with wanting to get better care for dementia … is a lot of pressure on the @entity2 which we need more staff for			1
‘ and what those reforms did , was we abolished the @entity160 , the @entity161 employed 19,00 people and we have put that money into the frontline			0
so , the @entity2 today has 7,000 more doctors , 3,500 more nurses overall than we had four years ago			2
“ we have saved actually as a result of those reforms over a billion pounds a year net , including the costs of redundancy , including the cost of the transition , all that			0
and as a result of saving that billion pounds a year we have more doctors , more nurses on our front lines , shorter waiting times than we would otherwise have had			0
’ @entity181 , head of the @entity2 , said that the health service needed more radical change to cope with a lack of cash			2
‘ recent methods of balancing the books are not going to be indefinitely repeatable , ’ he said			0
@entity188 , who led the fight against the reforms as chairwoman of the @entity192 , called the admission disgraceful			0
she said : ‘ i think politicians and policymakers need to have a long , hard look at themselves			0
‘ they are saying this now but they should have said it then			0
the big issue is that nobody has been held accountable for it			0
if mr @entity33 was a doctor , he would have been referred to the @entity205			2
