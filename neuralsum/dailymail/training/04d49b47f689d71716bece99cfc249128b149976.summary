the @entity0 of @entity1 has launched a campaign to bring 25 of their fellow soldiers killed in action home to @entity1 soil			1
with the majority of them buried in @entity10 , and just one soldier laid to rest in @entity12 , @entity8 veterans say their mates deserve a proper war grave in the country they died for			1
among those buried is @entity17 , and his nephew @entity18 said his family have been trying to get his uncle home for almost 50 years			1
' my mother she pushed tirelessly ... she never gave up and she never stopped grieving , ' mr @entity18 told @entity26			0
never having him at home meant she never had closure , and could not grieve properly			2
' it 's tragic enough that he was killed … but the real wrong is that they only bought him partway home , ' mr @entity18 added			1
@entity28 , a @entity8 veteran himself , also knew @entity45 , and got involved in the ' battle ' as he calls it , to get these men home many years ago			1
' for a lot of the people , and i 'm a @entity8 veteran , a lot of the people i talk to did n't even know they were n't bought home ' , mr @entity28 told @entity26 , speaking of the 25 men who were left behind			1
' for me personally , because i 'm very passionate about bringing them home , it would just bring closure to that sorry saga of a thing called the @entity61 war , ' he added			1
' ( it would ) give those next of kins , relatives , descendants and the whole @entity8 veteran community closure			0
' the reason many of the men were not brought back to @entity1 was simply because their parents could n't afford it			1
it would have cost them £ 500 , which was half of the average yearly wage in 1965			0
this is the grave of @entity35 - as his family and friends call him - which mr @entity18 and mr @entity28 recently visited @entity45 was killed in action in 1965 , but his next of kin , his sister , could not afford the £ 500 to bring him back recently , mr @entity18 and mr @entity28 went to @entity10 to visit the @entity85 on @entity34 where 24 of the @entity1 are buried			1
' you have to apply to the high commission of @entity1 to get permission to visit it , ' mr @entity28 explained			1
' then from the high commission of @entity10 and they have to apply to the army			1
' he said the whole process was long and drawn out , and took more than eight weeks to complete			0
even then they were only allowed to visit for two hours , instead of the four hours they had requested			0
' it was more powerful than i expected it to be , ' mr @entity18 said of the experience			0
mr @entity28 also said the visit to the cemetery was a highly emotional one , but helped to motivate him further			0
' it really gets up my nose when other people say they 're with their mates , ' mr @entity28 said			0
' when you talk about being buried with your mates , the graves are separated by religious denomination			1
' having been there and viewed these graves i can tell you they 're not with their mates , ' he continued			2
@entity116 ( left ) and @entity117 ( right ) are among those buried in @entity10 @entity119 ( left ) and @entity120 ( right ) are also listed in the 25 soldiers to be bought home after campaigning tirelessly for many years , the men , along with the the families of many of the other soldiers , hope they can bring the fallen home before the 50th anniversary of the @entity8 next year			1

when told about the plight of these soldiers ' left behind ' , the federal minister for veteran affairs senator @entity160 said : ' i am very , very sympathetic to this '			2
' if we can make it work we should be able to facilitate the return for those who believe it 's now appropriate to do so ' , he told @entity171			0
mr @entity18 said the return of his uncle @entity45 would mean the end to a difficult chapter in his family 's history			0
the tragedy tore his mother apart , and was so important to her that mr @entity18 's niece promised to carry on the campaign after her @entity182 passed away			2
' it 's a huge part of our lives ' , he said			0
mr @entity28 said the fallen soldiers deserved to be laid to rest in a war grave , out of respect for their service to the nation			1
' we have to rember that these people are not in a war , grave they 're in a @entity195 cemetary that happens to be in a military base , ' he said			2
' for me personally , because i 'm very passionate about bringing them home , it would just bring closure to that sorry saga of a thing called the @entity8			0
' i would like to work closely with the minister for veterans ' affairs and the @entity204 ' , in bringing this to fruition in a timely manner			0
' it is the right an honourable thing to do , they should n't be left in a foreign cemetery , ' mr @entity28 added			0
when asked what it would mean for him if his uncle could finally be laid to rest on home soil , mr @entity18 said it would mean the world			1
' it 's going to be hard to believe , for us it has been a 50 year battle ' , ' hopefully it will happen , if nothing else it just airs this wrong			0
' it should have been put to bed and grieved for 50 years ago			0
' if you would like to help bring these soldiers home , you can sign the petition on @entity226 , donate on their @entity228 page , and for more information visit bringthemhome.org .			2
