today the court was told that the security guard had wanted to drop the assault complaint as it was the @entity85 ’ wedding night			1
he said his injuries had been ' very minor ' and dismissed the incident as ' name calling , picking out differences in my appearance like calling someone fat '			0
@entity93 , defending said : ' she accepts the facts but she ca n’t recall everything			0
she had something to drink and she ’d had a very happy day , described as " bridal bliss "			0
' they turned up at the hotel , but her husband had been drinking heavily			2
' when she arrived she was wearing her wedding dress			2
she was very happy , had a case with her with a view of spending the night in the hotel but it was the honeymoon , that never happened			2
' instead she ended up in her wedding dress in a police cell , in separate cells to her husband			1
' today the court was told that the security guard had wanted to drop the assault complaint as it was the @entity85 ’ wedding day mr @entity93 spoke of the mix up with bookings and added : ' mr @entity114 at that point got very upset and irate and made it known his views to staff , he became noisy and offensive and abusive			1
' @entity121 became upset , she felt utterly humiliated standing in the middle of the hotel with people coming and going , she wanted to disappear			0
' it was claimed @entity114 told her husband she wanted to go and he gave her taxi money and and sat on a wall outside before mr @entity114 was escorted out by security			1
mr @entity93 added : ' she did n’t know what had happened inside to cause that			0
' she saw him sat on the barrier			0
he was removed forcefully from that and taken down			0
' she was very upset			0
the police came and she was taken to the police station			2

she has been sorely punished			0
' her marriage is in a precarious situation			0
she sought to walk away but became embroiled in it			0
' but during sentencing district judge @entity152 told @entity8 : ' you proceeded to spit into the guard ’s face and proceeded to punch him to the chest			2
' when he was seen to restrain you , you kicked him			0
i simply do n’t accept you do n’t remember using racial language or spitting in his face			2
' it seems clear to me that the incident did commence as a result of mr @entity114 ’s behaviour and they were forced to deal with him			1
' you became involved using particularly racist language and then assaulted him			2
those who indulge in racially aggravated behaviour must expect to be punished			1
' it ’s a very serious offence and a repeated assault on a gentleman - not only a punch but kicking and spitting in his face			1
' it occurred in the hotel reception then spilled outside			0
it was very late at night , you are not willing to concede that you were intoxicated , i expect drink played a part			2
