@entity6 , 41 , was passed out on the kitchen floor after taking a cocktail of drugs and drink when the child 's mother 's allegedly knocked over the tv set as she attempted to move it to plug in a scart lead and watch a dvd			1
@entity16 was lying below on his changing mat and died a day later in hospital after the incident at his home in @entity21 , @entity22 on december 6 last year			1
neglect : @entity24 , 25 , and @entity6 , 41 , who had initially denied child neglect but today changed his plea to guilty after giving evidence to @entity28			1
@entity16 pleaded guilty to child neglect midway through the trial but continues to deny manslaughter by gross negligence @entity6 had initially denied child neglect but dramatically changed his plea to guilty after giving evidence at @entity28 today			1
his former partner @entity24 , 25 , pleaded guilty to child neglect midway through the trial but continues to deny manslaughter by gross negligence			1
in her evidence she claimed @entity6 was responsible for the television falling and that she was upstairs in bed when it happened , having taken heroin and valium			2
she claims she decided to accept the blame on his behalf from the moment she made the 999 call from the address in @entity51			0
prosecutor @entity52 declared this was ' nonsense ' and that she was lying			0
@entity55 , defending @entity16 , said the circumstances of the case do not ' deserve plaudits ' for the conduct which led to the television falling , whoever was responsible			2
but he told jurors that they were not being asked to determine whether his client was a good mother but whether she dropped the television and if she did , was it behaviour which was ' truly , exceptionally bad ' rather than a mistake or a serious error of judgment			0
' we say the evidence points away rather than towards her being responsible , ' mr @entity69 said			0
' a not guilty verdict is not a vindication of @entity24 or a dereliction of @entity16			1
' @entity16 has pleaded guilty to child neglect over the circumstances that ' tragically and avoidably ' led to her son 's death and would be sentenced accordingly , he said			1
the jury heard police interviews of @entity16 , of @entity84 , @entity85 , in which she stated that she was the one who knocked over the television and that she also initially denied taking drugs			2
she was charged with manslaughter but later submitted a defence statement saying it was in fact @entity6 who was responsible for the death			2
in her closing speech , miss @entity93 said : ' she has to find a way out and the only way out now is to falsely accuse @entity6			0
' @entity6 , of @entity97 , @entity98 , was released on bail until his sentencing on january 31			0
the trial was adjourned until tomorrow morning when the jury is expected to retire to consider its verdict against @entity16			0
