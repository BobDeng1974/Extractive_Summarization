above , @entity6 attempts to defend herself argument : now , media regulator @entity28 has claimed the show breached broadcasting guidelines by not doing enough to prevent the teenager from becoming ' visibily distressed '			1
@entity55 , @entity6 and @entity22 are pictured on stage in another , the two siblings had a ' heated exchange ' on stage , which saw the older of the pair shouting accusations at the younger while security guards restrained them from getting too close			0
@entity13 could then be heard shouting : ' if you are going to do something , do it			0
do nâ€™t just stand there flinching like a silly anorexic slapper '			0
meanwhile , presenter @entity69 told viewers that @entity6 had a ' reputation ' with the opposite sex and had ' slept with 33 men ' - to which , the teenager replied : ' really ? ' argument : @entity28 said @entity6 appeared ' visibly distressed , shouting , crying and breathing heavily ' and was ' unable to defend herself ' during the programme			1

presenter : @entity69 told viewers that @entity6 had a ' reputation ' with the opposite sex and had ' slept with 33 men ' talk show : following an investigation , @entity28 ruled that @entity69 had not appeared to tackle the teenager 's distress in ' any meaningful way ' - and at times , had seemed to ' reinforce ' it			1
above , the presenter speaks to @entity13 ' however , at no time did the presenter appear to respond to her distress			0
' @entity28 said the show had failed to explicitly reference the support which had been available to the teenager from its production team			2
it concluded : ' as a result , viewers were not provided with sufficient information - and so context - regarding the steps that the licensee had taken and had in place to ensure due care was taken over her emotional welfare and dignity , and to limit her distress			0
separated : @entity28 launched the investigation after receiving a complaint from a viewer who was concerned about the reliability of the lie detector results given the distress they had appeared to cause the teenager ' the offence caused to viewers by the humiliation and distress of the 17 - year - old was not justified by the context			1

it also accepted that there had been an adequate amount of support and care provided			0
but it reminded broadcasters they needed to take care when including young people in shows that involve conflict or confrontation to let the audience know what steps have been taken to ensure the youngsters ' welfare has been protected			0
following the investigation , @entity11 accepted that ' it might have been helpful ' to indicate more clearly in the programme that support for @entity6 was ' ongoing '			0
