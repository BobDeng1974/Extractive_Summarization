by @entity1 reporter scientists have created cells capable of killing cancer for the first time			1
the dramatic breakthrough was made by researchers in @entity8 who created cancer - specific killer t cells			1
they say the development paves the way for the cells being directly injected into cancer patients for therapy			1
scientists have created cells capable of killing cancer for the first time			2
pictured : microscopic cells being cultured to kill cancer the cells naturally occur in small numbers , but it is hoped injecting huge quantities back into a patient could turbo - charge the immune system			1
researchers at the @entity26 revealed they have succeeded for the first time in creating cancer - specific , immune system cells called killer t lymphocytes			1
to create these , the team first had to reprogramme t lymphocytes specialised in killing a certain type of cancer , into another type of cell called induced pluripotent stem cells ( @entity36 cells )			2
these ips cells then generated fully active , cancer - specific t lymphocytes			1
these lymphocytes regenerated from @entity36 cells could potentially serve as cancer therapy in the future			2
previous research has shown that killer t lymphocytes produced in the lab using conventional methods are inefficient in killing cancer cells mainly because they have a very short life - span , which limits their use as treatment for cancer			2
to overcome the problems , the @entity8 researchers , led by @entity53 reprogrammed mature human killer t lymphocytes into @entity36 cells and investigated how these cells differentiate			1
the team induced killer @entity38 specific for a certain type of skin cancer to reprogramme into ips cells by exposing the lymphocytes to the ' @entity64 factors ' - a group of compounds that induce cells to revert back to a non-specialised , stage			1
@entity8 researchers who created cancer - specific killer t cells ( pictured ) say the development paves the way for the cells being directly injected into cancer patients for therapy the @entity36 cells obtained were then grown in the lab and induced to differentiate into killer t lymphocytes again			1
this new batch of t lymphocytes was shown to be specific for the same type of skin cancer as the original lymphocytes			0
they maintained the genetic reorganisation , enabling them to express the cancer - specific receptor on their surface			0
the new t lymphocytes were also shown to be active and to produce an anti-tumour compound			0
doctor @entity53 said : ' we have succeeded in the expansion of antigen - specific t cells by making @entity36 cells and differentiating them back into functional t cells			2
' the next step will be to test whether these t cells can selectively kill tumour cells but not other cells in the body			0
if they do , these cells might be directly injected into patients for therapy			0
this could be realised in the not - so - distant future			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity110			0
dr @entity111 , senior lecturer in @entity112 , @entity113 , said : ' the study tackled a novel , quite interesting approach to cell based therapy , something that we do not usually hear about			0
' although this approach requires further verification and a lot of work needs to be done before we can think about clinical trials , the initial data are promising			0
' this pioneering work definitely provides a strong foundation to build and expand our knowledge about new opportunities in cell based therapy and personalised medicine			0

the cells naturally occur in the body in small numbers
but it *'s* hoped injecting huge quantities back into a patient could turbo - charge the immune system
@entity8 researchers say the development paves the way for the new cancer and @entity149 treatments
