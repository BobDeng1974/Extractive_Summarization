by @entity1 reporter published : 00:18 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 03:45 est , 4 december 2013 @entity3 's ski resorts are taking the offensive in ensuring the multi-billion - dollar - a - year industry is n't hurt by recreational marijuana stores that are set to open at about the same time many families begin planning their winter vacations for some skiers and snowboarders , hitting the slopes with a joint or pipe tucked into a winter coat has long been commonplace			1
but with the stores set to open jan. 1 near resorts across the state - and a handful of companies offering cannabis - themed ski trips - the future is a bit hazy			1
will a pot tourism industry flourish or will families decide to go to resorts in states where marijuana is outlawed ? slippery slope : new pot laws , which were passed last year legalize marijuana possession in small amounts for adults over 21 , including out - of - state visitors for an industry already worrying about global warming , avalanches or simply a bad snow season , the stakes are high			1
@entity40 of @entity41 , a trade association that represents 21 resorts in the state , says the ski industry generates about $ 3 billion in tourism revenue annually and @entity3 had more than 11 million skier visits last year , more than any other state			1
' we are being proactive in educating the public in what to expect when they come to @entity3 to ski , ' she said			2
she added : ' we 're getting the word out that we have a lot of things to offer guests , but smoking marijuana is not one of them			0
... we have so much to offer our guests that outweigh the legality of possession of marijuana			0
' skiing and smoking do n't mix : ski industry officials note that it 's still illegal to smoke marijuana in public and on federal land , where 90 percent of @entity3 's ski resorts are located @entity72 says her organization is informing visitors through social media and its blog about the new pot laws , which were passed last year and legalize marijuana possession in small amounts for adults over 21 , including out - of - state visitors			1
some resorts also are addressing the issue with their respective towns and chambers of commerce			0
@entity72 said she has n't heard of anyone deciding not to come to @entity3 because of the new pot laws , and it 's too early to tell what resorts can expect to see after jan. 1			1
' that 's why we 're doing some education now to let people know what they can and ca n't do , ' she said			0
' the bottom line is guests should not expect to smoke marijuana in public at a ski resort			2
' but that expectation may not be realized in the @entity3 counties that are home to some of the state 's most popular resorts			2
in those counties , the measure to legalize pot passed by overwhelming margins			0
pot stash : mountain managers are concerned about safety and their tourism image			0
the fear is that some of the more conservative , family - run resorts will see a backlash from people who don ¿ t want to be in a cannabis cloud @entity125 's home county approved the measure by margin of more than 3 to 1 , and more than two - thirds of voters also approved marijuana in the home county of @entity3 's largest ski resort , @entity133			1
a whopping eight in 10 voters in the home county of @entity137 ski resort favored marijuana legalization			2
it 's also relatively easy to smoke marijuana at resorts without getting caught			2
wooded areas off some of @entity3 's slopes already are dotted with ' smoke shacks , ' old mining cabins that have been illicitly repurposed as places to use the drug out of the cold and wind			1
still , industry officials hope visitors will respect that it is still illegal to smoke marijuana in public and on federal land , where 90 percent of the state 's ski resorts are located			1
anyone who is caught risks having their pass taken away			0
it 's still illegal : industry officials hope visitors will respect that it is still illegal to smoke marijuana in public and on federal land , where 90 percent of the state ¿ s ski resorts are located			2
anyone who is caught risks having their pass taken away @entity171 with @entity172 , a @entity173 - based travel agency that plans custom cannabis - themed tours to ski areas and other destinations , insists his company and contracted guides will respect those laws			1
' it would certainly be done in private			0
we obey the law , ' the 39 - year - old entrepreneur said			0
' we do n't give people the opportunity to flout it			0
' @entity171 , who founded the company in march , said he is dealing with ' a large backlog ' of mostly out - of - staters who are interested in booking a cannabis - themed ski trip this winter			1
but he does n't think the new laws will change much of anything at resorts			0
' i think most people are pretty considerate			0
i think most cannabis users are pretty considerate , ' he said			0
one other issue that put @entity3 in the news this year aside from the new marijuana laws was flooding , but skiers do n't need to give that a second thought : no major resorts were affected .			1

major destination ski areas go on the offense as legal pot stores get ready to open near resorts
effect that new recreational marijuana laws might have on @entity3 's ski industry remains hazy
some marijuana - themed ski trips are already being *marketed*
