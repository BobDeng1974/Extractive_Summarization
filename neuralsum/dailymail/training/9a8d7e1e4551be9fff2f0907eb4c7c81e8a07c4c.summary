it 's nearing ' crunch time ' for @entity2 and the eurozone and failure to reach a deal over the country 's bailout would be ' very severe for economic and financial stability ' , according to @entity10 's finance minister @entity9			1

defiant : @entity2 prime minister @entity11 ( pictured ) signalled little intention of backing down from @entity2 's clash with its euro zone partners , despite a looming financial crisis ignoring calls from across @entity23 to compromise on a plan to extend @entity2 's bailout programme , he said he was confident a deal on the country 's future would ultimately be found but that @entity29 would not climb down from its pre-election pledges			1
' we are not in a hurry and we will not compromise , ' @entity11 told his party 's lawmakers in parliament			0
' we are working hard for an honest and mutually beneficial deal , a deal without austerity , without the bailout which has destroyed @entity2 in recent years , a deal without the toxic presence of the ( bailout inspecting ) troika			1
' @entity11 said his parliament would start voting in bills this week to implement campaign pledges of protecting primary residences from foreclosures and banning the sale of mortgage loans to distressed funds			1
a bill reversing labour reform and restoring collective bargaining agreements scrapped by @entity54 and @entity56 lenders would soon be presented alongside another one to deal with the ' humanitarian crisis ' in @entity2 , he said			2
the current bailout runs out in two weeks , and the @entity54 had originally said @entity2 would have to demand an extension to the loan by yesterday			1
but , following the collapse of a meeting in @entity65 , @entity23 officials gave the newly elected radical @entity67 government in @entity29 another three days , with the possibility of another meeting on friday			0
@entity70 , the @entity71 finance minister who chairs the @entity72 of 19 countries using the common currency , stuck to his guns , however , saying @entity29 must seek an extension			0
' it 's really up to the @entity2 , ' he said			2
' we can not make them or ask them			0
we stand ready to work with them , also ( over ) the next couple of days			0
' if no deal is reached , @entity2 will be unable to service its debt and could run out of cash , meaning it would not be able to pay its civil servants or fund pensions			2
economists have warned that this could see the country being forced out of the euro , which would spark a crisis in the eurozone and have damaging knock - on effects for the @entity10 economy			2
@entity9 said ' we 're reaching crunch time for @entity2 and the eurozone ' and warned failure to reach a deal would be ' very severe for economic and financial stability '			1
echoing the alarm @entity54 officials have voiced about the negotiating tactics of the left - wing government @entity2 elected last month to end hated austerity programmes , @entity9 added : ' what @entity10 really needs to see is competence , not chaos			1
' ' crunch time ' : @entity70 ( left ) , the @entity71 finance minister who chairs the @entity72 , said @entity2 must seek an extension , while @entity9 ( right ) warned failure to reach a deal would be ' very severe for economic and financial stability ' @entity2 's left - wing @entity113 government wants the country 's bailout to be restructured , with an end to many austerity demands			1
the @entity56 and @entity54 say there should be no change to the terms of the current £ 178billion loan			0
despite all the tough talk and ultimatums , @entity2 and its creditors in the eurozone are still expected to cobble together some sort of deal that will allow the country to remain a member of the euro currency			2
' if @entity2 were to leave the euro , the financial chaos that would follow could also spell the end of the @entity113 - led government , ' said @entity136 , analyst at @entity137			0
' for this reason it remains our central view that an eleventh hour compromise between @entity2 and its creditors is still likely			0
' the current bailout expires on february 28			1
any new agreement would have to be approved by national governments , so time is running out to reach a compromise			0
while the stock index in @entity29 declined only modestly tuesday , @entity2 's government borrowing rates are rising steadily - a sign investors are more wary of a potential bankruptcy			1
economists at @entity153 estimate that falling out of the currency union would see @entity2 's economy shrink another 10 per cent			1
that is on top of the 25 per cent it has already plunged since the crisis , putting it through a downturn similar to the @entity162 of the 1930s			0
a new currency would fall sharply in value , meaning painfully higher prices for imports like medicine and gas			0
companies ' debts in euros would swell , forcing many into bankruptcy			0
in the rest of the eurozone , taxpayers would be handed big losses on bailout loans their governments gave @entity2			2
the eurozone bailout fund - a pot of money backed by taxpayers - is owed € 142billion , individual countries are owed € 53billion , and the @entity185 € 20billion			0
