by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 07:14 est , 15 april 2013 it was @entity2 at the @entity3 and 150 women had packed into the pub to see @entity6 the male stripper in all his glory			1
but muscular @entity6 had to cancel at the last minute and was replaced by novice @entity9			1
unfortunately mr @entity9 fell far short of the audience ’s expectations			2
he was scruffy , thin , had no six - pack and looked as though ‘ he had been hit in the face with a wok ’			1
unsatisfied : the crowd was expecting heart - throb @entity6 , left , but instead got ' dirty ' @entity9 , right high hopes : the crowd had paid £ 10 each to see sexy @entity6 at the @entity3 , but he was forced to cancel what ’s more , he had no act to speak of either , and very soon the crowd was hurling abuse and screwed up napkins in his direction			1
just when it seemed that the £ 10 - a - head evening could get no worse the stripper , provoked by the abuse , apparently plunged into the crowd and started attacking the women			1
five police cars were sent to break up the scuffles at the @entity3 , at @entity31 , near @entity32 , @entity33 and 29 - year - old @entity9 was arrested on suspicion of assault			2
@entity36 @entity35 said : ‘ he was diabolical , he was disgusting , he just did n’t have anything , no music , no dance routine			2
' @entity41 ' : @entity42 ( pictured ) was not quite what the women wanted to see ‘ he looked like he had come off the street , he looked dirty , he was unshaven and he did n’t have a six pack			2
in fact , he looked like he had been hit in the face with a wok			1
' he just was n’t the sort of person you ’d want to see take their kit off			0
’ posters for the @entity2 showed a photograph of experienced stripper @entity6			2
but @entity6 cancelled at the last minute and an agency , @entity57 , sent mr @entity9 as a replacement			1
inadequate : unlike experienced @entity6 , left , the stand - in had no six - pack , music or dance routine bizarre : @entity9 , who dressed as a fireman , allegedly spat cream at the women in the @entity3 , @entity32 offended : when the women made it clear they would have preferred @entity6 , left , @entity9 lost his temper ' disgusting ' : the sceptical women heckled the fireman and threw screwed up serviettes at him whose round ? @entity9 allegedly dived into the audience , sparking a mass brawl mr @entity9 , who describes himself on @entity73 as an ‘ entrepreneur ’ , was due to be paid £ 150 for the show and stomped on stage dressed as a fireman			1
but the uniform did n’t fit and his performance was far from smouldering			0
the crowd , expecting a @entity83 - style show , began heckling after mr @entity9 allegedly spat frothy cream at them and then sat on a chair in the middle of the stage			1
miss @entity35 said : ‘ he did n’t move , he just glared at the audience			0
the women started booing and they then started scrunching up serviettes and throwing them at him			1
’ @entity91 , 58 , who has owned the country inn for seven years , said the disastrous evening had not put her off hosting a similar night			0
‘ we have even set a date for the next one – although i think we may steer away from firemen next time , ’ she said			0
the @entity99 agency said it will not be working with mr @entity9 again			0
a spokesman said : ‘ it was the first time we had used him and he let us down big time			0
‘ we have warned other agencies to stay away from him as he will mess up their bookings and damage their reputations			0
’ mr @entity9 , of @entity106 , @entity107 , who has been released on police bail pending further inquiries , was unavailable for comment			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
