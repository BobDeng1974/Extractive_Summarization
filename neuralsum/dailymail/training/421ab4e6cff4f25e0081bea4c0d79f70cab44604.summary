three @entity1 lawmakers asked president @entity2 on thursday to ban travelers from the @entity5 countries hit hardest by the ebola virus from entering the @entity7 until the outbreak of the disease is under control			1
@entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and 23 republicans in the @entity16 sent a letter to @entity2 calling on him to direct the @entity18 to impose a travel ban and restrict visas issued to citizens of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
in the letter , dated oct. 8 , they also asked @entity7 health and border control officials to consider quarantine for anyone who arrives from the affected nations after being exposed to @entity32 until 21 days have passed , the period in which they would show signs of the illness			1
the lawmakers go on to say @entity2 should not wait for the @entity60 to dictate how @entity7 authorities should proceed			1
' the @entity60 is an organization of unelected bureaucrats and political appointees of foreign countries , ' they wrote			0
' it has no duty to protect the lives and well - being of @entity7 , as you do			2
' furthermore , it has utterly failed to stem this epidemic through its own action , ' they added			0
the letter was released a day after the death of the first person diagnosed with @entity32 in the @entity7 , a @entity23 man who traveled from his home country on sept. 19 and died in an isolation ward of a @entity82 , @entity81 hospital			1
the case put authorities and the public on alert for the deadly virus and the government increased efforts to try and stop it from spreading outside @entity5			0
' since there is no effective means to identify asymptomatic travelers who harbor the disease , often unknowingly , only a temporary travel ban ... can prevent the further spread of @entity32 to the @entity7 , ' @entity12 , a @entity91 from @entity92 , said in a statement on thursday			1
in the same statement @entity92 rep. @entity100 , a @entity101 who signed the letter , said the the @entity7 ' must do all we can to protect our country from infection while aiding in the effort to combat this deadly disease			2
' ' taking necessary action to protect our citizens is paramount and is the sole responsibility of the @entity7 government ; not the @entity115 or the @entity60 , ' he added			2
@entity7 health authorities on wednesday announced they would begin enhanced screening of travelers for fever from the affected countries at five major airports after resisting earlier demands from federal lawmakers to beef up security measures			1
the ebola virus has killed nearly 4,000 people in @entity24 , @entity23 and @entity22 since march in the largest outbreak on record			1
it causes hemorrhagic fever and is spread through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person			0
the @entity134 won permission to shift $ 750 million in war funds to fight @entity32 in @entity5 as a @entity101 senator on friday lifted his remaining objections to the transfer			0
the action by sen. @entity142 of @entity143 will give the @entity134 enough funding for about six months of operations in @entity5 , including the deployment of up to 4,000 troops and the establishment some 17 @entity32 treatment facilities with 100 beds each			0
' after careful consideration , i believe that the outbreak has reached a point that the only organization in the world able to provide the capabilities and speed necessary to respond to this crisis is the @entity7 military , ' @entity142 said in a statement			0
the representatives who wrote to @entity2 on thursday made it clear that they support ' all efforts to provide humanitarian relief ' to @entity5			0
simply put , the lawmakers said , they just want the president and his administration to take ' commonsense steps to protect @entity7 citizens from this @entity32 epidemic			2

@entity1 reps . @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and 23 republicans in the @entity16 sent the letter to @entity2
they want him to direct the @entity18 to impose a temporary travel ban and restrict visas for citizens of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24
they also asked @entity7 health and border control officials to consider issuing a 21 - day quarantine to anyone who arrives in the @entity7 from affected nations
