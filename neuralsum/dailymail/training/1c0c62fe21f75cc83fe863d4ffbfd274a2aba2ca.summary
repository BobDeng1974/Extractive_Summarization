@entity1 's importance as a boxer and fighter goes way beyond the @entity5 medals or world titles he has won			1
as @entity10 ’s best - known and most popular muslim , adored by millions of fans of all denominations , the 28 - year - old ’s words carry particular weight in these troubled times when the world has been revolted by the slaying of 132 children in an attack on a school in @entity20			1
since he won @entity5 silver in 2004 at the age of 17 , @entity21 - born @entity1 has tried to be a healing figure with his fights attended by everyone from working - class white fight fans to imams from the mosque			1
in @entity20 , where his grandparents came from , his fame is possibly even greater , with virtually the entire population of 180 million knowing who he is			1
the @entity48 attack on @entity32 has affected @entity1 hard , particularly as he is now married with a baby daughter			1
while everyone else contemplates a turkey hangover , the welterweight will head east to @entity20 between @entity53 and @entity54 , to visit extended family and help rebuild the country ’s shattered morale			1
but @entity1 was brought back down to earth by the news of the massacre of schoolchildren in @entity20 many in his position — with a young family and the hope of a summer superfight with @entity67 , @entity68 or @entity10 rival @entity69 — would not want to be dragged into the religious or political sphere but @entity1 can not hold back about his feelings on hearing that gunmen had taken so many lives at the army school			1
he has donated the £ 30,000 pair of shorts he wore in last weekend ’s victory in @entity37 against @entity33 to help rebuild the school and ignores the potential personal danger in speaking out			1
‘ they were innocent kids , they had nothing to do with anything and the @entity48 killed them			1
they are killing their own people , ’ he says without hiding his emotions			0
‘ setting the teachers on fire in front of these kids , these people are ruthless and have no brains , and i ca n’t believe they would do something like this			0
it upsets me and it ’s disgusting to see			0
‘ you never think people would be so sick to do something like that			0
@entity1 announced that he will donate the £ 30,000 shorts he wore during in his last fight to charity ‘ i am definitely going to go there			1
there are not many role models in @entity20 ; i want people to see @entity1 as a good person , a good muslim , a good @entity20 and that they should be like me			1
‘ some people wo n’t even talk about the @entity48 because they do n’t want to get into the politics of it but i ’m open , i just want to speak the truth			2
‘ i ’ll be going to @entity20 in the next couple of weeks and this could be threatening for me to even talk about it			2
but i just want to speak the truth			0
‘ i have a little girl			0
imagine me sending her off to school and then finding out she had been killed			2
’ @entity1 ’s grandparents moved from @entity120 to @entity121 in 1963 but he still feels a special affinity with the country			2
he visited @entity20 in 2005 to hand out food parcels following a devastating earthquake in @entity126 and donated and raised money to rebuild schools and hospitals			1
the 28 - year - old 's shorts will be donated to the school attacked by the @entity48 in @entity32 , @entity20 in addition to his pride in @entity21 and @entity10 , he is a practising @entity107 , praying at the mosque every week , observing @entity135 and has visited @entity136 for the @entity137			1
‘ these attacks set @entity20 back , ’ he says			2
‘ @entity20 is a really nice , good country			2
i want the people there to see my personality and try to get kids to follow in my footsteps			0
‘ i ’m a nice person , i meet people , i ’m respectful			0
these people [ the terrorists ] are doing the opposite			0
’ @entity1 is aware of his unique role during a period of history where religion often seems a battleground rather than a force for good			1
his daughter @entity152 is seven - months - old and it might be wiser for @entity1 to ignore what is going on and concentrate on family and career , but he feels he can not ignore the opportunities his position brings			2
relatives weep over a 15 - year - old student who was killed during the massacre at the school in @entity32 ‘ it ’s tough , but boxing has educated me and made me smarter , ’ he says			1
‘ i can say things			0
i am the way i am , i ’m not fake			0
i have a heart , i have a good family around me and i ’ll speak the truth			0
’ of a potential backlash , he says : ‘ you ca n’t hide away from life , and anyway everything is in @entity175 ’s hands			0
i do a lot of charity work there and i want to rebuild the school that has been affected			1
‘ it ’s important to go there now and send a statement to a lot of people that @entity1 is going and he ’s going there to make a difference			2
’ in the ring , @entity1 — who has won 30 of his 33 fights — dreams of fighting @entity67 , renowned as the best pound - for - pound boxer in the world			1
so far , @entity67 has been dismissive of the challenge			0
a policeman stands beside empty coffins at the hospital after the school was stormed by terrorists if he continues to do so , a summer fight in @entity199 against @entity68 or @entity69 is likeliest			0
promoter @entity200 says he has already booked @entity201 on june 13 in anticipation of putting on @entity203			0
‘ he ’s wasting his money , ’ says @entity1 , who does not like @entity69 — though bookmakers are not so sure			2
@entity68 , 38 , is also an option			0
‘ i believe he would come to @entity121 to fight me , ’ says @entity1			0
however , boxing can be put on the backburner for now			0
@entity1 has an important trip to @entity20 to attend to that transcends sport .			1
