by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 14:49 est , 5 march 2014 @entity2 has compared @entity4 's decision to have @entity6 troops invade @entity7 to a tactic used by the @entity9 in the lead up to the second @entity11			1
the former secretary of state said that by using the guise of protecting the minority of native @entity6 living in the @entity15 , @entity4 has taken an approach that was used by @entity17 in order to help him encroach on neighboring countries			1
' now if this sounds familiar , it ’s what @entity17 did back in the 30s , ' @entity20 said at an event in @entity25 , @entity26 on tuesday			2
looking back : @entity2 said that @entity4 's tactics in saying that he is protecting the @entity6 minority in the @entity15 are similar to those used by @entity17 when he began to annex neighboring countries in @entity30 ' all the @entity31 that were ... the ethnic @entity31 , the @entity31 by ancestry who were in places like @entity36 and @entity37 and other places , @entity17 kept saying they ’re not being treated right			1
" i must go and protect my people " and that ’s what ’s gotten everybody so nervous			0
' @entity17 's policy was called ' @entity44 ' , or ' @entity45 ' , and led to the @entity9 annexing portions of @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity36 to be ' returned ' to @entity31 after their troops were granted entrance to the areas under the guise of helping @entity31 nationals in the outside territories			1
in a similar vein , @entity4 recently issued @entity6 passports to any @entity15 with ties to @entity58 , which many saw as a way to lay his claims for entry			1
' @entity4 is trying to assert his power in a way that is dangerous , ' @entity20 said			2
according to @entity66 , she went on to say that @entity4 is a person ' who believes his mission is to restore @entity6 greatness ... when he looks at @entity15 , he sees a place that he believes is by its very nature part of @entity58			1
' plan of attack : president @entity4 has issued @entity6 passports to any people with @entity6 descent who live in the @entity15 so he has justification to enter the country to ' protect ' @entity6 citizens in shambles : the political situation in the @entity15 remains uncertain and a memorial has been set up where nearly 100 anti government protesters were killed in @entity84 's @entity83 this is not the first time that mrs @entity2 has blasted the @entity6 leader			1
@entity88 reported she jokingly said during the 2008 presidential campaign that ' he was a @entity91 agent			0
by definition , he does n't have a soul '			0
tuesday 's talk was just the latest paid speech that the former secretary of state has made in recent weeks , this time speaking at a private event held at the @entity99			2
her comments were not released publicly but an audience member told @entity102 that she praised the work of her successor , @entity104 , who arrived in @entity84 on tuesday to help assess the ongoing crisis			0
@entity104 's trip coincided with @entity108 's approval of a $ 1billion aid package to the @entity15 , which came ahead of the @entity111 's own package of $ 15billion			0
he has since traveled to @entity112 and is scheduled to speak with @entity6 foreign minister @entity113			0
she went on to say that the situation in @entity7 is ' a real nail - biter , right now , but nobody wants to up the rhetoric			0
everybody wants to cool it in order to find a diplomatic solution and that ’s what we should be trying to do			0
' ready for talks : secretary of state @entity104 has arrived in @entity112 ahead of talks scheduled for wednesday with the @entity6 foreign minister			2

the former secretary of state said that @entity4 is *copying* @entity17 's move of entering neighboring countries under the guise of protecting his citizens
@entity6 troops have taken control of @entity7 in the @entity15 and many fear that they will try to *expand* their control across the country
sparked immediate international outrage and *fears* of *impending* *war*
@entity20 called the situation ' very *worrisome* '
@entity6 are the minority in the @entity15 but @entity4 recently issued them passports , which meant that they were *technically* @entity6 citizens
