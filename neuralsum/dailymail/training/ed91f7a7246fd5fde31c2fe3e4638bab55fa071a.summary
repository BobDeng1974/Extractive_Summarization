@entity4 the @entity2 turkey could have graced the royal family 's dinner table this year - but instead he decided to make a run for it			2
after being loaded onto an abattoir - bound lorry in @entity11 , the organically - bred bird managed to give farmer @entity13 the slip when part of the back door became unlatched			1
unfortunately for the fleeing turkey , his escape route ended in the garden of the farmer 's mother - in - law who found him outside her front door			1
bird with plenty of pluck : @entity4 the turkey courageously jumped from an abattoir - bound lorry in @entity11 @entity13 , who works at the farm on the @entity30 in @entity11 , was left baffled when he discovered he was one turkey down on arrival at the slaughterhouse however , mr @entity13 , 52 , was so impressed by the bird 's escape that he decided it to spare it from the chop , calling it @entity4 in recognition of its daring escape			1
the farmer , who works at the farm on the @entity30 in @entity44 - where @entity45 and the @entity46 source their @entity2 turkeys - was left baffled when he discovered he was one turkey down on arrival at the slaughterhouse			2
the poultry farmer said : ' i was obviously shocked to see the door was open and then unfortunately had to deal with all the paper work			2
' it is 70 miles to the abattoir so i did n't expect to see the turkey again			0
i was just thankful that only one of the birds had managed to escape			0
' but @entity4 did n't disappear			0
in fact he turned up in the village of @entity62 , near the home of mr @entity13 's mother - in - law , @entity64			1
mr @entity13 said : ' i got a phonecall from my mother - in - law , @entity66 , and she said that a turkey had been found in the village			1
stay of execution : the organically bred turkey was destined for @entity2 dinner but managed to flee when a part of the truck door became unlatched escape artist : @entity13 pictured on the @entity30 with @entity4 the turkey when the farmer thought his turkey was gone forever , the @entity4 wandered into his mother - in - law 's garden and was recaptured ' i said " well that 's a coincidence as i am missing one "			1
they had heard it pecking around their courtyard and even on the front door			0
' mr @entity13 travelled to his in - laws and took the turkey back to the farm where hundreds of turkeys are bred for @entity2 every year			2
lord @entity92 with @entity4 the turkey named after the @entity95 prison camp his owner 's father was interned in owner of the @entity30 , @entity92 , found the turkey 's escape attempt hilarious - and helped decide the name of the intrepid bird			1
he said : ' the turkey has become a bit of a mascot for the @entity107 organic farm and he should be safe from this @entity2			0
' my father escaped a @entity95 prison camp in @entity111 but was captured and sent to @entity4 , so we thought that would be a fitting name for the turkey			2
' the previous @entity92 , @entity116 , was held at the infamous @entity95 prisoner of war camp for the final two years of the @entity111			0
@entity116 was an officer in the @entity118 and in 1942 played a decisive role in the destruction of the @entity122 held port at @entity123 , @entity124			0
he died in 1998 but his son @entity125 , the current @entity92 , is glad to pass on a memory of him to the new @entity107 estate celebrity			0
@entity4 may be safe from @entity2 but his counterparts will be heading to the @entity130 hotel in @entity131 , @entity134 's @entity133 cookery school and even to the table of the royal family .			1
