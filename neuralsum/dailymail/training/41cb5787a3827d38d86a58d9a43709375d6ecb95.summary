as my stepfather put the shepherd ’s pie on the table , the pride on his face was palpable			2
‘ i ’ve been working on this recipe for decades , ’ he announced			2
‘ and i ’ve finally perfected it			2
’ my reaction was not what he ’d hoped for			2
after just one forkful , i groaned , sprinted through the back door and vomited in a flowerbed			2
but this was no reflection on the meal			2
it was my response to almost all food , leaving me starving and lethargic — and at a time when i needed my energy most			1
torture : @entity23 with her husband @entity24 and children @entity26 and @entity27			1
both proved difficult pregnancies for i was pregnant , and suffering the extreme morning sickness that blighted both my pregnancies and has afflicted @entity32 — though the generic , ubiquitous term ‘ morning sickness ’ little reflects the unending , inescapable nausea and vomiting i suffered every day			1
throughout the 18 long , terrible months i carried my children i did not live , i merely existed , sick and exhausted , waiting for my sentence to be served			1
it was so severe , and so much worse with my second pregnancy , that it destroyed me both physically and mentally			2
it meant i was even forced to forgo my hopes of another child			2
this torture is , i fear , the fate awaiting the @entity32 as she embarks on her own second pregnancy , having once again been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum			1
it is a strangely flowery title for such a vile condition			2
for those who wonder what it feels like , i would compare it to having food poisoning every day for nine months solid			2
strong resolve : the @entity32 earlier this week ( left ) and during her first pregnancy ( right ) of course , there are times when it eases off , briefly , or sufferers would be hospitalised throughout			1
but in my 42 years on earth nothing has been harder than living with hyperemesis gravidarum			2
it even made the pain of childbirth come as a relief			2
it is the sole reason my husband and i decided not to have any more children			1
we would have loved more — @entity24 is one of three and we both wanted a brother or sister for @entity27 , eight , and @entity26 , six — but the prospect of going through nine months of hell again was beyond me			2
it did n’t start out like this , of course			2
when we married in 2005 , @entity24 and i were keen to have lots of children and we did n’t have to wait long			1
@entity78 was a honeymoon baby and the miracle of a tiny new life growing inside me was so exciting it carried me through a tough pregnancy			0
for reasons unknown , my sickness tended to come on in the afternoons , so the mornings were n’t too bad			1
but as the day wore on , i would become exhausted — and by the time @entity24 came home in the evenings , i would be lying on the sofa groaning , with a washing up bowl on standby for when i could n’t reach the bathroom			1
still , at least i had the freedom to sleep when i needed and had no responsibility to anyone except myself			0
doctors prescribed medication , none of which made the slightest difference , so i soldiered on until @entity78 came along and gave me no time to think of anything , or anyone else			1
relief : the royal couple with @entity104 , who was born after @entity32 experienced severe morning sickness yet while that pregnancy was difficult , it was as nothing compared to my second , with @entity26			1
ironically , we were hopeful that history would not repeat itself and this would prove an easier ride			0
but when i became pregnant again , when @entity78 was just one , we realised immediately that this time around would be infinitely worse			1
not only did i have the extreme sickness and the unborn baby to think about , i also had a lively , inquisitive little child who needed my attention at all times and required round - the - clock care			1
the experience nearly broke me			0
the sickness was even worse this time , too			1
whereas in the first pregnancy it came and went , easing off slightly by the third trimester , now it was a near - constant companion			0
i felt so sick the weight dropped off me			0
while mothers are supposed to gain weight throughout the pregnancy , as they store the reserves to feed their baby , i lost it : at seven months , i weighed half a stone less than i did before i got pregnant			0
i remember my mother looking at me one day , concern in her eyes , and saying my face looked ‘ gaunt ’			0
i ate a tub of ice cream every night , as it was the only thing i could stomach			1
doctors juggled prescriptions in an attempt to ease the symptoms , to no avail			1
at one point they suggested hospitalising me under a consultant ’s care , for an intravenous drug , but said they could n’t guarantee there would n’t be risks to my baby			0
i was desperate for help , but on hearing those words i declined			0
yet the impact ran far deeper than the physical symptoms			1
it had a deep psychological impact which we are still , to a degree , dealing with today			1
i developed a phobia of speaking on the phone because i was petrified of throwing up mid call			0
i felt stressed and unhappy , and as the pregnancy wore on my mood got only lower			0
friends would try to lift my spirits by saying it would pass , but after five months of sickness i knew in my bones it was n’t going to end until the baby was born			1
as the pregnancy wore on we had to hire a nanny to look after @entity78 in the afternoons , as i was incapable of anything more strenuous than fitful sleep			0
i felt terrible guilt both for the damage i was doing to my unborn child and also to my daughter , who could n’t understand why her mother kept disappearing			0
baby seat : prince @entity186 with baby @entity104 last year			0
he will soon have a brother or sister to play with i was ashamed of it at the time — and to this day i feel awful for having ever uttered these words — but the nadir came at seven months when i tearfully blurted out to my husband : ‘ i just want this thing to die so it will stop			1
’ we were both shocked and distraught by my outburst			0
it is an unspeakably terrible thing to resent your unborn baby , but i was n’t in my right mind at the time			1
months of relentless sickness had , in the bleak moment of that 3am outcry , driven me to the brink of madness			1
i spoke to my doctor again and started seeing a counsellor , which helped me stay sane in those final two months			0
the birth came as an utter relief to both of us			0
@entity26 was , and remains , utterly gorgeous , and he and @entity27 are the light of our lives			0
but the difficulties were not extinguished with his arrival			0
for nine months of sickness had left me at my lowest ebb , both psychologically and physically , and when i gave birth i was utterly spent			1
more confident : @entity23 with her family today just at the time when i needed all my strength to care for twice as many children , the well was dry			1
it is hardly surprising that i went on to develop post-natal depression and i would be astonished if @entity32 has not experienced something similar			1
i feel terribly sad that i was unable to enjoy the earliest days of my children ’s lives			1
since they came along i have put work aside and given my life to them , staying at home as a full - time mum			1
they make me laugh every day and i can not imagine life without them , but in the aftermath of my pregnancies the world was a very bleak place			0
over time i recovered and there have , thank goodness , been no ill - effects for the children			1
they are thriving at school , @entity78 is already a budding actress and @entity26 is never without a football at his feet			0
but there is one lasting legacy of my morning sickness which will never go away : the fact that we were unable to have any more children			1
for during the dark times we went through in that second pregnancy , we both agreed we could never subject ourselves , or our children , to that again			1
i do n’t think my body or mind could withstand another torment			0
yet i have lost count of the number of occasions a newborn has tugged at my heart strings and made me madly broody			0
while we do not talk about it often , i know @entity24 feels the same			0
he is perhaps not as dotty about the nappy changing stage ( few men are ) , but i know he always wanted a bigger family and we often reminisce about what @entity78 and @entity26 were like as toddlers — the silly words , the quirky mannerisms and just how tiny they were			0
there has been an odd occasion on which we have had a pregnancy scare , raising the awful question of what we would do			0
thankfully they were false alarms , so we have never had to make the choice , but the fear of what might happen is all too real			0
people have said to me that it is ‘ only nine months ’ , but that is a lifetime when you are seriously ill. psychologically it was incredibly trying — i was in therapy because i felt so trapped and awful			0
yet the ache for another sought - for child never quite goes away			0
it is stronger than ever right now , as our children are growing up so fast and @entity26 , my lovely baby boy , is at the age where he refuses a kiss in public			2
i long to hold another baby in my arms			0
but having another is out of the question and i do feel extremely lucky to have had two healthy children			2
thankfully for @entity32 , she has all the support money can buy			1
she will have staff who can cook , clean and look after @entity104 , not to mention the best doctors in the country on hand to ensure the new child is born strong and well			0
am i jealous that she has greater support ? knowing what she is suffering right now , there is nobody i would less like to be .			0

@entity319 suffered same extreme sickness as @entity32
symptoms were so bad she decided not to have any more than two children
now she reflects on a time which had a *profound* psychological impact
she once blurted to her shame : ' i just want this thing to die so it will stop '
