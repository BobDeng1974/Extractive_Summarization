by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 21 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:30 est , 21 february 2014 when @entity5 , 50 , from @entity6 in @entity7 decided he had had enough of life in the fast lane , his solution was dramatic			1
recently divorced , fed up with his job and tired of his new life in @entity12 , in 2008 @entity5 put his entire life up for sale on @entity15 , with his car , job and motorbike among the items included			1
£ 216,000 better off , he decamped to a deserted island in the @entity21 and six years on , says , despite the lack of creature comforts , he 's happier than ever			1
remote : after selling his life on @entity15 , @entity5 , 50 , spent the proceeds on a private island in @entity27 now his incredible story is to appear on a new @entity30 documentary in which he reveals what giving everything up for a new life in the wilderness is really like			1
' i ’ve always been a bit of an adventurer and so have always spent a lot of time pursuing outdoor activities such as climbing , canoeing and diving , ' he reveals			0
thanks to his new home , a tropical island off the coast of @entity27 , he has plenty of time to indulge in all three , even if that does mean living without electricity and running water in a tiny self - built cabin and growing or raising most of his own food			1
' we 're not completely self sufficient here on the island , ' he admits			2
' we do grow coconuts , pineapples , yukka , sugar cane and almonds but we have n’t yet perfected the art of growing other vegetables on our land			0
isolated : the island is a 20 - minute boat ride from the nearest jungle town and was totally uninhabited transport : @entity5 and his girlfriend @entity65 use homemade canoes to get around ' we have 10 chickens who roam free on the island so our eggs are totally organic			1
sometimes the local @entity72 will bring freshly caught fish to the dock for us to buy			2
' everything else comes from the supermarket in town or @entity78 – a small store on the edge of the jungle			0
' with little need for cash thanks to his @entity15 sale and the book deal that ensued , most of @entity5 's time is spent working on the land or relaxing on the beach			1
' we usually get up quite early , between five and six o’clock and do some work until around nine , ' reveals @entity5			2
' then it ’s breakfast for us , the chickens and the dog			0
we get involved with the local vhf radio transmission a couple of days a week that broadcasts to the expats			0
' we spend time working outside on the land , snorkelling on the reefs off the bay , swimming and reading			0
home : @entity5 lives in a house he built himself and grows much of his own food on the island companions : one of the flock of 10 chickens who keep @entity5 company and provide a supply of eggs on the island hands on : @entity5 carries a tethered goat onto the island ( left ) and attempts to get a @entity118 signal ( right ) ' once in every 10 days we go to town for food supplies and fuel			1
sundays without fail we go to our jungle restaurant , @entity124 , where we meet up with the local community for an afternoon of drink , food and dancing			0
' despite the remoteness of his new home , which is a 20 - minute boat ride from the nearest town , @entity5 has found someone willing to share it with him - girlfriend @entity65 , who he met last year during a visit to @entity136			1
' @entity65 coming to live here has made a big difference [ to my life ]			2
' we met last year when i passed briefly through @entity136 and she came to live here a couple of months later			0
' with @entity65 on board , @entity5 says his happiness is complete and adds , his family notwithstanding , that jet - skiing is the only thing he misses about life in the @entity150			1
hard work : @entity5 , pictured with @entity30 , puts his woodwork skills to use on building a new canoe home from home : @entity5 and @entity65 show @entity30 around the island for an episode of @entity158 in the wild ' there is n’t really much i miss at all , ' he says			1
' i enjoy living a relatively simple life			0
maybe a better internet connection would be good			0
oh , and an evening out with family and friends at a good @entity167 pub on a friday night			0
' @entity65 still misses a @entity136 style cappuccino but i think she ’ll get over that soon			2
' he adds : ' i would n’t change anything - i really enjoyed building an off - grid home and living on the island			2
i 've always thought life is supposed to be an adventure			0
' @entity5 and @entity65 appear on @entity30 : new lives in the @entity159 , tonight at 9pm on @entity178			1
