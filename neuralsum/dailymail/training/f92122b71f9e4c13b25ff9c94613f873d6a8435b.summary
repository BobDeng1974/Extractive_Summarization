by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:18 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 12:06 est , 23 september 2013 @entity2 has promised to take to the ‘ barricades ’ in the general election battle as she vowed not to just stand silently next to husband @entity5 in a nice dress			1
party strategists plan to put mrs @entity2 on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election			1
but she has vowed to break with convention and speak out publicly about why she thinks mr @entity12 should be prime minister			1
life 's a beach : in the latest photo opportunity @entity5 and @entity2 were pictured on @entity16 apparently reading his leader 's speech side - by - side : @entity2 and @entity12 walk through @entity21 city centre in one of several photo opportunities during the @entity25 conference the child actress - turned - barrister has begun making a public appearances and speeches at the @entity31 conference to ‘ humanise ’ her husband			1
mr @entity12 repeatedly said he would not copy @entity34 ’s habit of eye - catching photo opportunities while opposition leader , and would instead focus on policies			1
but the party conference in @entity21 has seen a string of family photo opportunities , walking through the city centre and strolling on the beach with sons @entity44 , four and @entity46 , two			1
the decision to use mrs @entity2 into the political fray has drawn comparisons with failed attempts by @entity51 and @entity52 to use their other halves to rescue their leadership			2
stepping out : mrs @entity2 toured the conference exhibition stands at the @entity56 but she signalled that she will do more than wear a stylish dress for the traditional posed snaps at the end of the leader ’s speech			1
speaking at a @entity25 event in @entity21 , she said : ‘ i wanted to come along to say a few words because i thought , “ if i do n't say anything to you guys tonight probably all you 'll know about me this year is the make of the dress i wear for @entity5 's speech on tuesday ”			1
‘ that 's a side of me the media tend to focus on and i thought it was quite important to reassure you that i am in fact more than a dress			1
’ the couple met in 2005 and got married in 2011			2
the environmental lawyer revealed the moment she realised she had fallen for mr @entity12 – while rearranging chairs in a hall in @entity82			2
she told delegates : ‘ in may 2005 , @entity5 was the prospective parliamentary candidate for @entity84			2
‘ so i went to @entity82 to help him campaign and i was moving chairs around in a hall getting ready for a campaign meeting and i became aware there were three long - standing party members watching me			1
‘ after a while one of them said to me who was i , so i explained that i was a friend of @entity5 's and i had come from @entity94 to help him campaign			1
‘ there was a pause and then the lady said to me , “ that 's a very long way to come to move chairs , are you sure you 're just friends ? ”			2
‘ she was clearly very astute and realised before we did i think			2
’ the mother - of - two also told @entity25 members she is willing to help them in the run - up to the 2015 general election before joking : ‘ after all you now know i can door - knock , i can move chairs although i guess falling in love at the same time probably gave it a bit of a different dimension			1
nonetheless i am ready and willing			0
’ in 2010 , mr @entity12 emerged victorious in the election for @entity31 leader ahead of his brother @entity114			1
mrs @entity2 said she supported her husband 's decision to become leader , adding of the last three years : ‘ i 'll be honest , i did n't know the half of what was to come			1
’ flashback : last year mrs @entity2 impressed the delegates with a bright red dress from @entity123 and nude heels from @entity125 she explained she understood the reasons why he wanted to hold the position after visiting a working men 's club in @entity130 for a question - and - answer session			1
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ as i listened to @entity5 's answers i realised firstly he knew and understood about the lives of the people in that room and secondly that he cared about creating a society that would n't feel like it felt to me that day , which was the people there and the bankers and the lawyers around me in @entity94 were living in two separate countries			2
‘ that was it for me			0
that was the day when i understood why @entity5 had decided to stand to be leader of the @entity31 , difficult a decision though that was for many reasons , and it was the day when psychologically the day i threw my lot in with @entity5 and the @entity31			1
‘ so , there it is , that 's why i 'll be on the barricades in 2015 wearing whatever dress the media deem necessary to get us through			1
’ a @entity31 source said this was just the first stage of what will be an increasing effort to raise the profile of the leader ’s wife			1
‘ she is a huge asset to @entity5 , she is a huge asset to the @entity25 but she is her own person			0
she is a career woman with two young children			0
' ‘ she comes across better than him , frankly , ’ said another source			0

. making yourself look better by standing next to someone worse looking than yourself ! poor wife ! poor hair ! @entity189 , @entity190 , 1 hour ago more than a dress ? she is a nobody ... just like @entity193			2
@entity194 , @entity195 , @entity171 , 1 hour ago i have lived through many prime ministers and seen governments both @entity199 come and go			0
over the last twenty years i have witnessed our beloved country fall to its knees by successive @entity25 regimes who mismanaged every aspect of government and am now living through the cuts and belt tightening we are having to go through to try and recover ! my point is , at no time during all that have i ever contemplated leaving this country despite the hardships , despite all the horror of @entity216 war mongering			0
but if @entity12 ends up prime minister after the next election , i will leave the land of my birth and not return until he s gone ! i do n't like him and i certainly do n't trust him , if he can stab his own brother in the back , how can we trust him to look after our country			2
he is a liability and if @entity25 want to win , they need to get of of him and @entity227 and start being honest about how they all but destroyed this country ! @entity230 , stourbridge , @entity231 , 2 hours ago i wish she would take her husband and the idiotic and immature @entity227 as well			0
both a complete waste of space			0
