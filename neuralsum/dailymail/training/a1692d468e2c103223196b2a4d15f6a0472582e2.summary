by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 06:36 est , 14 march 2014 there are few , if any , drawbacks to feeling happy and now a new study has shown that a positive state of mind can boost our brain power			1
researchers set out to investigate if a new breed of offices complete with football tables , slides and crazy golf are a waste of time , or whether they boost productivity			0
the scientists discovered that happy people outperformed their stressed counterparts and were more - efficient employees			0
happiness makes you smarter : a new study claims that happy employees outperform unhappy ones and make better software developers ( illustrated ) in particular it is well known that good moods can be contagious , but researchers now think that happiness can even spread through the world wide web			1
@entity33 researchers studied social networking interactions over three years and found that positive messages spread through contacts			2
researchers , from the @entity38 analysed more than a billion @entity40 status updates , among more than 100 million users , and found that positive statements generated similar messages among friends			2
and they found that happy messages spread further than miserable ones			0
the study , published in the journal @entity49 , examined posts by people in cities where it was raining - known to increase the number of negative posts and reduce the number of positive ones - and the impact this had on the status updates of people in cities where it was not raining			2
to make sure there was no ‘ topic contagion ’ all weather - related status updates were removed from the analysis			0
each additional positive post generated an estimated 1.75 positive posts amongst friends while each additional negative post yielded 1.29 more negative posts			0
a number of modern workplaces now offer staff fun things to do during their lunchbreak			0
@entity79 was among the first large firm to incorporate games tables and fun distractions into its offices			1
while the company has gone from strength to strength , researchers have wondered if the firm ’s ' work hard play hard ' work ethic has been part of its success			0
‘ for more than 30 years , it has been claimed that a way to improve software developers ’ productivity and software quality is to focus on people and to provide incentives to make developers satisfied and happy			0
this claim has rarely been verified in software engineering research , ’ the study says			0
now a team of researchers from the @entity104 in @entity105 have proved that @entity79 ’s strategy is a good one , after collecting data from 42 computer scientists at the university			1
they tested students to investigate how their emotions and moods affected their programming abilities as well as their creativity and problem solving , @entity111 reported			1
‘ among the many skills required for software development , developers must possess high analytical problem - solving skills and creativity for the software construction process , ’ the study says			1
after measuring the emotional states of the students using what psychologists call the @entity128 ( @entity129 ) , they tested the creativity of each participant by asking them to write captions for photographs , which were scored by a panel of judges			2
researchers set out to investigate if a new breed of offices , exemplified by @entity79 ( pictured ) which come complete with football tables , slides and crazy golf are a waste of time , or whether they boost productivity			0
they found that happy software developers write better code they were then asked to play a game to investigate their problem solving skills and the time they took to solve the puzzle provided a score on their analytical capabilities			1
they failed to show that happiness boosted creativity , but they did find that happy software developers were better at problem solving – a skill highly - prized by businesses such as @entity79			1
‘ the empirical data supported a difference in the analytical problem - solving skills of software developers regarding their affective states , ’ the study says			2
‘ more specifically , the results suggest that the happiest software developers are more productive in analytical problem solving performance			1
’ so it seems that it is worth tech companies investing in fun activities for coders at work			0
after measuring the emotional states of the students in the experiment , they were asked to play a game ( pictured ) to investigate their problem solving skills and the time they took to solve the puzzle provided a score on their analytical capabilities			1

the study by the @entity104 in @entity105 found that happy computer developers write better code than unhappy workers
researchers investigated how mood affected students ' programming abilities to find that quirky offices with fun distractions are *worthwhile*
having a positive mood boosted problem solving , but an increase in creativity could not be *conclusively* linked to happiness , in the study
