so it perhaps no surprise that @entity9 could help spot post-natal depression			1
@entity12 scientists have identified changes in use of the site that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes after her baby is born			1
the information could be used to treat women sooner or simply to ensure they have the help and practical support they need after the birth			0
@entity9 could help spot post-natal depression ( stock image ) and one day scientists think an app could be developed to help women get the help and advice they need in future , it may be possible to create an app to provide early warning and dispense advice			1
around one in seven new mothers suffer from post-natal depression but the stigma surrounding the condition leaves many afraid to seek help			1
@entity42 , head of @entity44 ’s biggest lab in @entity45 , hopes that by making diagnosis easier , more new mothers will get the attention they need			2
however , there are likely to concerns about privacy , particularly when dealing with the sensitive area of public health			0
dr @entity42 began by scanning archives of @entity9 messages for words and phrases related to the announcement of a birth			0
when he was satisfied he had identified several hundred new mothers , he began to analyse their messages from the three months before and after having their baby			1
@entity12 scientists have identified changes in use of @entity9 ( pictured ) that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes after her baby is born an infant ’s wails pull at the heartstrings in a way that other cries do n’t , researchers found			1
just milliseconds after registering the cry , the brain ’s emotion centres are hard at work			0
it had been thought that the brain was incapable of processing complex facets of sound in such a short time			0
other types of cry , including calls of animals in distress , fail to elicit the same response – suggesting the brain is programmed to respond specifically to a baby ’s cry			2
in 2012 , a team of @entity95 scientists scanned the brains of 28 men and women as they listened to a variety of calls and cries			2
after 100 milliseconds – roughly the time it takes to blink – two regions of the brain that respond to emotion lit up			0
their response to a baby ’s cry was particularly strong , the @entity107 ’s annual conference in @entity108 heard			2
the response was seen in both men and women – even if they had no children			0
researcher dr @entity115 said : ‘ there is a specialised processing in men and women which makes sense from an evolutionary perspective that both genders would be responding to these cues '			2
he looked for changes in the amount of time the women spent on @entity9 , the people they were in touch with and the language used			2
for instance , an increase in the use of ‘ i ’ suggests someone is becoming more introspective and self - focused and has been linked to the onset of depression			1
he then created software that analysed pre-birth tweets to predict with of over 70 per cent accuracy if a woman ’s @entity9 messages would show signs of depression after having her baby			1
adding in her tweets in the first fortnight after motherhood boosted the accuracy to 80 per cent			0
a second study using @entity152 posts confirmed that even although depression does n’t hit until post-birth , changes in social network activity and postings pre-birth provide information about who is likely to be hit			0
dr @entity42 said ‘ we can predict future behaviour and mood with well - characterised confidence ’			1
he told the @entity163 ’s ( @entity163 ) annual conference that someone could use his basic research to create and early - warning system that a pregnant women could install on her mobile phone			1
he said : ‘ reading some of these tweets you can almost feel yourself in the hearts and minds of these people			1
you really feel for them as they struggle			0
‘ imagine a new mums ’ coach that was an app running on your own smartphone that might watch what you say to the world and your tweets			1
to spot post-natal depression , scientists looked for changes in the amount of time the women spent on @entity9 , the people they were in touch with and the language used			1
they found that heavy use of ' i ' shows a sense of isolation ( illustrated ) ‘ it might say “ i sense you might be grappling with this , here ’s more reading about this , do n’t worry it will last this long and here are resources for you , ” versus people just being abandoned right now and crying on their own and being paralysed			2
’ he added that while there are likely to be ethical concerns , the app would be something that was run privately , on a woman ’s own phone			1
@entity213 , of post-natal depression charity the @entity215 , said many women with post-natal depression find the thought of a medical appointment daunting and would welcome a test they could do in the comfort of their own home			0
however , he questioned whether they would get the support they needed @entity225 is also using the internet to benefit health in other ways			0
for instance , by looking at questions typed into computer search engines , it is able to identify women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and see if they are getting all the health information they need			0
dr @entity42 has also shown that the number of people rushed to hospital with heart failure rises as more salty recipes are downloaded from the internet .			0

@entity12 scientists have identified changes in use of the site that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes after her baby is born
they analysed new mothers ’ tweets from the three months before and after having their baby to spot *differences* in how people used the site
an increase in the use of ‘ i ’ suggests someone is becoming more introspective and has been linked to the onset of depression , scientists said
it may be possible to create an app to spot early signs and offer advice
