by @entity0 there 's an old adage that opposition parties do n’t win elections , governments lose them			1
it ’s a crutch that ’s easy to lean on for those who subscribe to what ’s becoming an ever more cautious approach to politics			1
but parties rarely walk into @entity12 by default			2
you have to earn your right to govern			2
you ca n’t simply freewheel into @entity17			2
you have to break the door down with a battering ram			1
recent polls showing a @entity22 resurgence are a timely reminder that @entity24 wo n’t win by fighting defensively and dodging punches			1
it ’s time we came out swinging			2
@entity24 mp @entity0 , right , believes leader @entity28 , left , needs to move away from his ' comfort zone ' if the party is to win the next general election for far too long , we ’ve relied on the unpopularity and incompetence of this government rather than focusing on our performance and offering solutions to the nation ’s problems			1
it was foolish to think that could carry on for ever			2
sooner or later the @entity41 were always going to get their act together			0
now we need to up our game			0
the polls show that @entity24 ’s message is n’t hitting home			1
we ’ve become too comfortable with talking to ourselves , with policy announced through set - piece speeches as though in a university lecture			0
some in the party view politics as an intellectual pursuit ; it ’s not , it ’s a monumental struggle to win hearts and minds			1
at this stage in the electoral cycle there ’s no point in just harping on about the government ’s failings and it ’s too late to rely on negative campaigning alone			0
mapping out a vision for a better @entity65 , however , wo n’t be achieved by just setting off a few fireworks or coming up with some catchy slogans			2
it has to be part of a conversation that addresses people ’s doubts			0
and it has to reach out beyond @entity24 ’s core vote			1
we wo n’t win a general election by campaigning excessively on food banks and the bedroom tax			1
@entity24 has to offer a route out of poverty and unfulfilled potential			1
continually reciting a mantra of misery is not the answer			0
we have to start speaking the language of aspiration			0
@entity65 needs a government with a convincing mandate to introduce the big changes that are required			0
but @entity24 ca n’t achieve that with the core vote and a few disgruntled @entity92			1
that ’s a suicidal strategy			0
mr @entity0 said too many people in the @entity24 view the business of politics as ' an intellectual pursuit ' rather than a ' monumental struggle ' @entity99 has proved that there ’s a rich seam of despairing voters out there			1
they ’ve been ignored for far too long and @entity24 has to show it ’s willing to listen			1
it ’s daft to characterise @entity99 voters as disaffected loons , because many are simply working - class people tired of the three main parties			0
a lot are @entity24 people and we need to work hard to get them back			1
there are still many in the party who think we have a right to govern			2
some have mostly known @entity24 victories , which makes it easy for them to dismiss the 2010 election as an aberration			1
new mps such as myself know all too well there is no easy way back into power			0
the latest polls are a wake - up call			0
but we should be under no illusion			0
time is running out and if we do n’t have a strong showing in the @entity138 and local elections this week then things will need to change			0
@entity24 does n’t need to panic – yet			1
but more of the same wo n’t cut it			2
earning the trust of the public is hard and there are no short cuts			0
between now and election day there are many questions the electorate want answering			2
we ca n’t leave them unanswered			0
from now on all signs need to point away from our comfort zone .			0

@entity24 needs ' a battering ram ' if it wants to win the next general election
party wo *n't* win contest unless it treats politics as a ' monumental struggle '
@entity24 needs to reach out beyond its core vote if it is to win election
