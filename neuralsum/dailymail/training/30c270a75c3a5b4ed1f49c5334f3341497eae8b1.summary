by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 after returning to training after suffering a broken vertebra at the @entity6 , @entity3 could 've been forgiven for taking it easy on his return to action with @entity10			1
but the @entity12 forward , who only recently began taking part in full training , lit up the @entity15 as @entity17 's side comfortably beat @entity19 club @entity20 6 - 0 in a friendly			1
@entity3 scored twice in his first game back after recovering from the serious injury he suffered at the hands - or should that be knee ? - of @entity25 in @entity27 's quarter - final victory over @entity28 in @entity29			1
his first major contribution was to provide the assist for fans ' favourite @entity56 to open the scoring after just three minutes			0
and nine minutes later he was on the scoresheet himself			0
the former @entity61 star latched onto a pass before running through on goal and chipping the ball over visiting goalkeeper @entity40			0
not enough : @entity40 gets a hand to the ball but could n't stop @entity3 scoring his second goal of the night skills : @entity3 opts to backheel the ball into an empty net to put @entity10 3 - 0 up just before half - time more to come : @entity3 , pictured here celebrating at the @entity15 , is looking to hit the new season running @entity73 focussed on team performance despite @entity32 debut @entity3 grabbed his second goal of the night just a minute before half time after combining with @entity56 once again			1
the @entity76 lifted a clever ball over the top of the @entity20 defence which @entity3 attempted to take round @entity40 with his first touch , only for the keeper to palm it out to his left			2
the @entity12 ran on and picked up the loose ball though , cleverly backheeling it into an empty net with his first touch			0
although he was replaced by @entity86 - who scored twice in the second period - at half - time , @entity3 did more than enough to suggest that his back injury will have no lasting effects .			2

@entity3 played his first game since returning from a broken vertebra as @entity10 beat @entity20 6 - 0 in a friendly
the 22 - year - old was injured by @entity28 's @entity25 in @entity27 's 2 - 1 @entity6 quarter - final win
