this pooch may be small in stature but proves size is no barrier to wreaking havoc on a party			2
as two men are getting an outdoor entertaining area in @entity9 in @entity10 ready for a celebration , the puppy decided to get the games going early			1
the black dog sank its teeth into the most colourful decoration it could find - a long line of bunting - and led the two men on a not - so merry chase			0
party time : a little black dog steals the bunting during party preparations and plays a game the puppy darted under tables and chairs that had been laid out for the party to keep away from his masters			1
the men appear keen to avoid hurting the puppy and further damaging the bunting as they chase the dog from side to side			0
after a little over a minute the puppy 's game was over , and unfortunately for the men so was the bunting			0
ca n't catch me : the puppy weaved in and out of tables and chairs in the outdoor area too elusive : two men chased the puppy but only catch up with her when she 's done with the game			2

black puppy stole bunting from a **man** setting up a party in @entity10
the little pooch is too elusive for the **man** and a *friend* to catch
the men , in @entity9 , got the bunting back but not in *brilliant* *condition*
