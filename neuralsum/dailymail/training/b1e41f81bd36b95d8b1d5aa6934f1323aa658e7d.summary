by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:59 am on 2nd february 2012 @entity4 's biggest broadband suppliers are failing to deliver by providing speeds half as fast as advertised , a study revealed today			1
providers like @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 all delivered actual broadband speeds which were half as fast as their advertised packages			1
an @entity14 study found that @entity7 , who advertise 20mb broadband , had an average actual speed as low as 6.3mb , while @entity10 's 8mb package in reality delivered speeds as low as 3.7mb			1
slow coach : broadband packages from @entity7 , @entity9 , @entity23 and @entity8 are falling well short of their advertised speeds , according to @entity14 however , firms like @entity26 who offered super-fast broadband of up to 30mb were hitting their promised targets			1
@entity26 's 50mb meanwhile offered an impressive average of 48.8mb			0
the @entity14 study also found a huge difference in performance between @entity9 's faster and slower broadband packages			1
its new £ 18 a month @entity37 service promising speeds of up to 40mb averaged 36mb , whereas households on its 20mb deal for £ 14 a month had to endure a sluggish 8mb			2
those on @entity44 's 24mb broadband averaged download speeds of 7.4mb - less than a third of the speed advertised			1
@entity14 chief executive , @entity48 said : ' there is a real opportunity for consumers to look at the packages and deals in their area in order to receive the best value , speeds and performance available to them			2
' a spokesperson for @entity9 said the difference in speeds was due to the speed difference between fibre optic and copper cables			2
the spokesperson said : ' there are other factors involved like the distance of the house from the exchange and even the wiring in the home			0
' we make it clear to customers what speed they can expect depending on where they live before they sign up			0
' no customer should be in any doubt as to the likely speed that they should expect from our service			0
' we provide comprehensive broadband services at great value where speed is important			0
' @entity14 found the average speed across @entity4 was @entity91 in november compared with @entity92 in 2010			0
new guidelines will be introduced in april meaning suppliers will have to be more accurate with the speeds they advertise .			0

@entity9 , @entity8 , and @entity7 all fail to deliver on advertised broadband speeds
