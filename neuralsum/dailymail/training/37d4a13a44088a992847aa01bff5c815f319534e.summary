shocking : @entity0 confessed to murdering an 11 - year - old girl who came to his @entity3 home to sell candy in 1990 , but walked free after serving just half his sentence @entity0 senselessly murdered an 11 - year - old girl as she sold candy door - to - door in 1990			1
despite having confessed and remained unrepentant , he walked out of prison a free man friday			0
@entity0 , who said he ' just snapped ' and killed @entity10 and stashed her corpse in a @entity12 , @entity13 , had only served half of his original 50 - year sentence			1
the now 65 - year - old cold - blooded killer received that sentence prior to a change in @entity3 's so - called ' good time ' laws , allowing him to cut his sentence fully in half with good behavior and his participation in self - improvement programs			1
@entity0 was sentenced at age 41 back in 1991 after he told police he opened his door to find @entity10 , snatched her from the porch and killed her			1
' at the time we thought he would be in his 80s or 90 when he got out			0
you get some sense of peace with that , ' @entity10 's aunt @entity33 told @entity38			2
@entity3 lawmakers changed the good time law in 1997 in order to ensure that violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their prison term , which offers little but cold comfort to @entity10 's family			1
horrific : @entity10 was selling candy for a school fundraiser when @entity0 murdered her and stached her body in a dumpster			1
served half his sentence : @entity0 benefited from a since - changed law allowing violent @entity3 criminals to shave off as much as half their sentences with good behavior and self - improvement programs @entity33 created a @entity57 page in honor of @entity10 's memory soon after learning of @entity0 's early release			1
a january 22 post read : ' another day has dawned and our @entity10 is still gone , and now her killer walks free			2
the cold , gray rain outside matches our grief			0
' according to @entity66 , @entity0 has chosen to live int he @entity68 area in central @entity3			1
@entity0 's release is one of many slaps in the face that @entity10 's family has endured			2
not only was her killer unrepentant about his crime , the little girl 's body was never found			2
' he 's an evil man			0
he never showed any remorse or regret , ' @entity33 said			0
@entity0 told authorities he 'd dumped her body in an area @entity80 , but searches came up empty			2
@entity10 's body was never found even after @entity0 's confession , so prosecutors charged and got @entity0 convicted of just manslaughter and kidnapping the case was reopened years later and authorities dug up the driveway of @entity0 's former home in search of @entity10 's remains , to no avail			1
while her death did put a stop to children raising funds door - to - door for a time , even that effect of the heinous crime did n't last			1
nonetheless , @entity105 , with the help of her @entity57 page justice for @entity10 , continues her fight with the help of other outraged members of her community			0
