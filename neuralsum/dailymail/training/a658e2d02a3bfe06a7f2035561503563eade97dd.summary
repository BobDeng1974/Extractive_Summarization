by @entity1 reporter published : 09:56 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 16:19 est , 12 march 2013 the @entity3 's hottest new ship and the centerpiece of its renewed focus on @entity6 is n't its largest vessel , or its most technologically advanced			1
but it has advantages that its bigger siblings lack			0
the 388 - foot @entity12 , which cost the government $ 670 million , is small enough to move among the many islands and shallow waters of @entity6 , a trait that allows the @entity3 to train alongside similar - sized vessels in the region 's navies and build relationships with them			1
all this , the @entity3 believes , will help it make sure the region 's critical waterways stay open to the trillions of dollars in oil and other trade that passes through each year			0
it 's an objective so important the @entity3 is sending the @entity12 to @entity30 this month even as automatic federal spending cuts carve into its budget			2
new ship : the $ 670 million @entity12 combat ship pulls into @entity35 , @entity36 on its way to a deployment to @entity30 ' we hold our commitment to them , to our area , our theater , so highly that this deployment has not been affected , ' said rear adm. @entity45 , the @entity46 deputy chief of staff for plans , policies and requirements			1
' the @entity3 and the @entity46 are still on watch , ' he said			0
freedom on monday sailed to @entity35 , into the prime mooring spot the @entity3 often reserves for ships it wants to show off			1
the blue and gray camouflage painted on its sides — designed to confuse hostile small boats and make it less visible from shore — stood out amid the plain gray hulls of the other surface vessels in port			1
until now , most @entity63 ships visiting @entity6 have been aircraft carriers , destroyers , cruisers and other large boats well equipped for jobs like firing cruise missiles or defending against fighter jets			1
but they dwarf smaller ships @entity63 partner navies from other countries — such as @entity30 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 — use for missions like patrolling the seas , catching pirates and stopping human and drug trafficking			2
the larger vessels are also too big to pull into shallower ports , forcing them to sometimes anchor offshore while in the region			0
the @entity3 is sending the freedom to @entity30 this month even as automatic federal spending cuts carve into its budget the @entity92 is equipped with guns and a helicopter and is designed to defend against small boats and other threats			1
the @entity3 will later have the option of swapping out its surface warfare equipment with so - called modules for hunting submarines and finding and disabling mines			2
when he commanded ships moving through the region , @entity45 remembered , his counterparts from other countries would tell him that they 'd like to work with smaller @entity63 vessels			2
' their flag officers would say , ' hey , i 'm glad you 're here , i love your big ship , but can you send us smaller ships ? can we exercise with smaller ships because your ship is very big , '' he recalled			0
the littoral combat ship weighs less than half as much as a typical @entity63 destroyer and carries a crew of fewer than 100 sailors			1
it measures about the length of one football field — a scale that will allow the @entity63 to join countries as a partner			0
navy chief petty officer @entity125 , left , and lt. @entity126 , monitor screens on board the @entity12 ' it 's a whole different world , ' @entity45 said			0
the @entity3 plans to keep the @entity12 in the region for eight months , though its @entity132 - based crew will rotate out after four			1
another crew will serve the rest of the deployment and take the ship back home to @entity138			0
@entity45 said the @entity92 will spend its deployment practicing basic naval skills in bilateral exercises with partner nations			0
some drills will involve practicing responses to disasters and providing humanitarian assistance			0
in a few years , the @entity3 aims to have the ships participate in multilateral exercises .			2
