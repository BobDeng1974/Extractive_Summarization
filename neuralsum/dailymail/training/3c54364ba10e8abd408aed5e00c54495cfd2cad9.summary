a bloated gym worker decided to kick his bad eating habits and get into shape after he discovered his boss was so ripped he was now entering a bodybuilding contest			2
@entity5 , 26 , from @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , spent every day at the gym where he worked but did n't fit in with the super-buff crowd			1
an avid fast food fan with long and irregular working hours , he would often pick up a @entity13 or @entity14 on his way home two or three times a week and also a takeaway at the weekends			0
the fitness competition , run by supplement company @entity23 , saw @entity5 attempt to improve his health and lifestyle as much as possible			1
while he and saw great results , he still was n't in peak physical condition			2
@entity5 , who works in the gym membership department for a leisure club , admits his real goal the second time around was to fine tune his aesthetics			1
' the real thing was the looks side of it			0
i was n't overweight but i was n't in the best shape			2
i just thought that 's how it was and i could n't change it			2
' the six pack abs and the defined muscles you see in films seem to be something of a myth , ' @entity5 recalls			1
@entity5 thought the six pack abs and the defined muscles you see in films were something of a myth ' like so many others i accused them of using @entity52 or just made excuses like i ’ve been working all day and could n’t train instead			1
' that 's until i looked at my boss [ @entity55 ] , last year 's winner , and realised real people can get these amazing results			0
' @entity55 , the club 's sales manager , had won the @entity60 and was now preparing to compete in a bodybuilding competition			0
so @entity5 signed up again from january 6 2014 and together with @entity55 started working to progress and really transform his body in just 12 weeks			1
and he could n't be more delighted with the results			2
breakfast : cereal such as bran flakes lunch : large portion of pasta or spaghetti bolognese dinner : sausage egg and chips or another type of takeaway snack : crisps and chocolate breakfast : egg and salmon on granary bread lunch : three small portions of turkey breast cous cous and veg dinner : steak with sweet potato salad , then later peanut butter on granary bread snacks : nuts , yoghurt fruit the pair trained at the gym they both work at five times a week working on cardiovascular exercises such as cycling , running , swimming , and also resistance training focussing on biceps , chest , legs , back and core			1
@entity5 even managed to squeeze in his five - a - side footy training at the weekends			1
that was coupled with three months of clean eating - that 's ditching all that pasta , white bread and potato - and eating six small meals each day compared to his usual three large ones			1
@entity5 also bought products from @entity23 to supplement his regime			1
he drank three protein shakes a day ; one first thing in the morning , one after training and one just before bed ; took the amino acid tablets to protect muscle breakdown and help with recovery , took the zma tablets and also some of the pre-workout supplements			2
' @entity128 was always going to be the biggest hurdle for me , ' he says			0
' twelve weeks sounds like nothing , but the first seven days of changing your routine and eating patterns felt like a month			0
' but i cut out excess salt saturated fat and sugar , cut out fizzy drinks the weight started falling off			1
' i changed my four large meals to seven smaller portions spaced at three - hour intervals , ’ @entity5 explained			1
@entity5 showed off his ripped physique in @entity144 , and he now gets loads of attention ' i swapped my regular bran flakes breakfast for eggs and salmon on granary toast , and then for lunch i would have three small meals spread through the working day such as cous cous and tuna , rice and turkey and a chicken salad			1
' i 'd sometimes have three of the same for ease			0
it 's all about meal prep - one of the most useful tips @entity55 's given me			0
' i also had a cheat meal every saturday night , which in fact increase my motivation and spurred me on to train harder			0
' after moving away from stodgy high - carbohydrate meals towards more protein and healthier options , in just over a month @entity5 could see a big difference			1
the @entity21 saw him lose more than a stone going from his heaviest at 12st 10lbs to 11st 5lbs			1
cardiovascular exercise 4 - 5 times a week for 30 - 45 minutes such as cycling , running , swimming and outdoor fitness activities			0
resistance exercise 4 - 5 times a week for 30 - 45 minutes focussing on biceps , chest , legs , back and core			0
he 's now reached his goal and managed to get his body fat down to 7/8 per cent , when around @entity184 it was about 15 per cent			1
he even managed to drop it down to 6 per cent for a recent holiday			0
@entity5 has just returned from a hedonistic , much - deserved break to @entity144 for @entity188 , where he wasted no time flaunting his pecs on the beach and at pool and boat parties			1
' i 'm a lot more confident i 'm absolutely happy with how i look in pictures with my top off , especially compared to this time last year			0
' and @entity5 , who is currently single , is getting plenty of attention and admiration since his transformation			2
' i 'm getting more attention from everyone			0
in the gym its really noticeable ; all my friends are asking for diet advice			0
' my housemate , who is n't ripped , saw my results and signed up to the @entity21 himself afterwards			0
' ' the idea behind the challenge is its a bit of a competition and there 's an annual winner [ who gets £ 5,000 ] , ' says @entity5			2
while @entity5 did n't with the challenge overall , he has been excelling at sports and changed his life ' you take your before picture and then weekly progress pictures and keep a diary , logging your weight and measurements week to week			1
only you and the @entity23 staff can see this , not other competitors			0
' it just motivates you to stay with your clean eating and training			0
' there 's an optional workout guide from the supplement company which can assist with the challenge			0
it embraces both cardiovascular and resistance weight training for around 4 - 5 times per week and consists of a lean muscle gain diet plan aimed at improving weight loss and increasing toned , lean muscle tissue			2
' since the challenge has finished , i ’ve continued to train at the same intensity to give me the results that i have always wanted , ' says @entity5 ‘ i encourage anyone that has struggled to achieve their goals in the past to set themselves the challenge and i guarantee they will be amazed by their own before and after pictures - just like me			2

@entity5 , 26 , from @entity6 , @entity8 , works at a gym but did n't fit in
ditched large stodgy portions for six small , regular lean protein meals
