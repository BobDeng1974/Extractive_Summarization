@entity1 's defence may have been ruthlessly exposed by @entity2 on thursday but @entity4 's problems do n't end there			1
the @entity1 were second best in all areas of the pitch as they exited the @entity8 6 - 4 on aggregate , leaving them to concentrate on a @entity11 campaign which has failed to ignite			1
with @entity4 's men languishing 14th in the table - 23 points and nine places worse off than at this stage last season - @entity12 takes a look at the underperforming players the @entity20 must get rid of this summer if the @entity21 are to get back on track in 2015 - 16			1
@entity1 's players look dejected during their 5 - 2 defeat at @entity2 in the @entity8 last 16 @entity1 boss @entity4 has a huge summer ahead of him when the transfer window opens @entity27 after a stellar first season under @entity4 and some brilliant performance at the @entity30 with the @entity31 , @entity27 been arguably @entity1 's worst player this season			1
high profile errors - particularly at home to @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 - have helped cost the @entity1 much - needed points and contributed to a shaky , unsure defence			1
@entity4 's decision to return @entity27 to his starting @entity41 after injury - despite some promising displays from @entity44 - has backfired			2
at 36 , he will only get worse			0
goalkeeper @entity27 is left on the turf at the @entity46 after conceding a third goal on the night @entity48 off the pace and out his depth against @entity2 , @entity48 's 18 months at @entity49 have been a mixed bag of injuries , decent performances and some truly awful defending			1
the @entity55 , who was also part of @entity4 's back - three at @entity57 , lacks the speed and consistency to play for a team with @entity62 aspirations , while he is always liable to pick up a knock			0
with his contract up at the end of the season , it 'd be wise to invest @entity48 's wages elsewhere			1
@entity48 had an evening to forget as the @entity1 were dumped out of @entity62 in embarrassing fashion @entity70 a regular under @entity72 , @entity70 has simply been unable to stay fit under @entity4			1
he shone on the opening day of the season against @entity37 , working in tandem with @entity76 down the @entity1 ' left side , but has not played since mid-december and has made just eight @entity11 appearances this season			2
the team has missed his partnership with @entity76 , guile and eye for a pass but , at 33 and with his injury problems persisting , @entity70 's time in the first - team looks over			0
@entity70 ( right ) , pictured in action against @entity89 , has barely played this season due to injuries @entity92 age appears to have finally caught up with @entity92 after a catastrophic start to the season left him out of the team and almost certainly on his way out of the club			2
the 37 - year - old was consistently at fault in the early stages of the campaign , contributing to the @entity1 ' awful defensive record with ponderous , error - prone displays			0
now stuck playing for the under 21 side after falling out of favour with @entity4 , it 's time the @entity109 hung up his boots or moved on			0
defender @entity92 is believed to have fallen out with @entity4 and has not played since last year @entity111 over a year into his @entity1 career and @entity111 is still yet to show the form which convinced @entity114 to spend almost Â£ 10million on him in 2010			2
although quick with the ball at his feet , the @entity117 international 's delivery leaves much to be desired and he has chipped in with just one goal since his arrival			0
improvement is needed if he is ever going to earn a regular place in @entity4 's starting @entity41 - and in the hearts of @entity128			0
@entity111 , pictured being sent off against @entity129 , has struggled to make an impact at @entity1 @entity131 one of the most important cogs in @entity4 's well - oiled machine of last season , @entity131 has fallen well below the high standards he set last year			1
at 33 he has played too much football in 2014 - 15 and should 've been rested when in the midst of an awful run of form prior to @entity140			0
nevertheless he looks to be growing slower by the game and is struggling more and more to keep up with the pace of the @entity11			0
@entity131 , pictured tussling with @entity144 's @entity143 , struggled with the pace of the @entity147 side @entity148 another player with an awful fitness record , @entity148 has managed just four @entity11 appearances all season and last played in the top - flight on december 6			1
as a local lad with over a decade at the club it 's easy to let sentiment get in the way when it comes to @entity148 and his role as a squad player			0
but with promising defender @entity163 coming through the ranks , there 's little need for him now			0
veteran defender @entity148 ( left ) , pictured chasing @entity166 , has barely played this season			2

@entity1 were dumped out of the @entity8 on thursday evening
the @entity1 are 14th in the table and six points away from the drop *zone*
@entity48 had a night to forget as the @entity1 lost to @entity2
@entity131 and @entity27 have not *replicated* their form of last season
@entity70 and @entity148 do not appear to be able to stay fit
