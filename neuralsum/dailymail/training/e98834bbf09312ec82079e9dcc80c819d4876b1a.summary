@entity14 , chairman of the @entity16 select committee , said : ' there is now an overwhelming case that the decision to where the @entity11 should be held in 2022 should be run again			1
' conservative mp @entity21 , who submitted a private member ’s bill to @entity24 last month that would fight corruption in football , also called for the process to be re-run			1
a damning email dossier shows how @entity2 former president of the @entity3 used the slush fund to garner support for @entity8 's bid to host the tournament			1
the @entity34 reports that the bribes helped sway key members of @entity10 ’s 24 - man ruling committee into giving the green light for the @entity41 emirate to host the tournament , despite its lack of football infrastructure			1
it is alleged that delegates who decided upon the destination of the 2022 competition were treated to lavish junkets and large cash payments to secure their support			1
the secret dossier provides evidence of £ 3 million in cash payments to football officials across the globe in order to secure support for the @entity8 bid			1
when the decision was announced , there was shock as the @entity63 state has no tradition of football or any suitable stadiums			0
also , concerns were raised that with temperatures exceeding 50c , it would be dangerous for both players and supporters			0
during one session in 2008 , @entity2 is believed to have handed over $ 200,000 in cash to 25 delegates who had been flown to @entity75 to discuss the bid			1
it is alleged that @entity79 football officials received cash payments up to $ 80,000 from accounts controlled by @entity2			1
@entity10 president @entity82 , right , awarded the competition to @entity63 state following a vote in december 2010 the disclosures come less than two weeks before @entity87 is set to host the @entity11 and will heap pressure on the tiny desert state			1
one official sought $ 232,000 to be paid into his personal bank account which he said would be used to develop football pitches			0
@entity2 was banned from world football 2011 after he was discovered bribing officials during his bid to get elected @entity10 president			1
@entity10 is now under pressure to re-examine the @entity8 bid as a result of the latest corruption allegations the @entity8 @entity11 committee now face an investigation by @entity10 's ethics investigator @entity103			1
the @entity105 lawyer is due to fly out to the middle east next week to investigate the controversial competition bid			1
among the shocking allegations , @entity34 alleges that former @entity110 football chief @entity109 was paid $ 450,000 before the 2010 bid			0
@entity8 , which holds the world ’s third - largest natural - gas reserves , plans to spend more than $ 200 billion on new infrastructure before hosting the sporting event			0
this is expected to include $ 34 billion on a rail and metro system , $ 7 billion on a port and $ 17 billion on an airport			0
the stadiums will cost $ 4 billion , according to the ministry of business and trade			0
however , the @entity126 state of two million people is facing delays and escalating costs related to the event			0
work started later than planned on the metro system , and the opening of the new airport is six years behind schedule			0
it originally announced plans for 12 stadiums , including nine new playing fields and three refurbishments , but that has bee cut to eight			0

prime minister @entity152 and prince @entity153 played a central role to the failed @entity156 bid			0
only last month , @entity10 president @entity82 admitted it had been a ‘ mistake ’ to hand the tournament to @entity8 after technical assessors had said the searing temperatures could be harmful to players			2
the revelations emerged as it was reported that police were probing @entity11 match - fixing involving @entity166			1
a football agent was secretly filmed claiming that @entity166 footballers were willing to rig ties in @entity87 for cash , saying : ' i know the games , i know the system			0
' members of the @entity8 delegation denied that @entity2 had any role in their successful bid , while members of his family refused to comment on the issue			1
@entity10 's former president of the @entity11 organising committee @entity109 has been at the centre of corruption allegations the awarding of the @entity145 to @entity8 was one of the most controversial decisions in sporting history			1
even before the decision was made , there were persistent allegations of corruption			2
six weeks before the vote in @entity195 , a @entity11 official was caught in an undercover investigation agreeing to sell his vote to one of @entity148 ’s rivals			2
a second member of the same committee was recorded asking for £ 1.5 million for a sports academy			0
both officials were suspended , meaning that 22 people voted instead of the usual 24			0
a whistleblower also claimed that one of the bidders had bought the votes of three @entity79 executive committee members			1
the former @entity10 employee later withdrew the allegations			2
following @entity148 ’s defeat , a parliamentary committee held an inquiry into the failed bid			2
@entity216 , the bid ’s former chairman , gave evidence stating that four @entity10 executive committee members had asked for business deals and favours when negotiating their support			1
one of those he named was former vice-president of @entity10 @entity109			2

payments totalling almost $ 750,000 ( £ 450,000 ) were made to mr @entity109 's sons , documents show			2
a further $ 400,000 ( £ 240,000 ) was paid to one of his employees			0
it is understood that the @entity242 is now investigating @entity243 - based mr @entity109 and his alleged links to the @entity8 bid , and that the former @entity10 official ’s eldest son , who lives in @entity248 , has been helping the inquiry as a co-operating witness			1
the question of the heat during a summer tournament has also been a one of the controversies raised since @entity8 was announced as the winner of the bid in december 2010			0
@entity257 has said it will urge its members not to take part if it is played in @entity8 's summer , even if air conditioning is installed in the stadiums			2
@entity8 's building projects have also been hit by allegations of migrant construction workers not being given enough food or water , as well as accusations of corruption over the voting procedure to win the bid			2
officials have denied the accusations			0
overall , the tiny gas - rich state plans to spend about $ 140 billion on a rail system , a new airport , a seaport , and hundreds of kilometers of new roads for the tournament , in addition to the stadiums that will host the matches			0
soul diva @entity283 entertains the crowd during the opening ceremony for the 1994 @entity11 at the @entity287 stadium in @entity288 the @entity289 ( 2022 bidder ) @entity289 , which was an initial bidder for 2022 , would undoubtedly be popular with travelling fans and it already has the stadia in place			1
however , the @entity289 hosted the cup relatively recently , in 1994 , when @entity283 famously missed an open goal at the opening ceremony			2
@entity298 ( 2022 bidder ) @entity300 has never hosted a @entity11 , so taking the finals there would allow @entity10 to say it has taken the game to another continent			1
@entity298 , also beaten by @entity8 for 2022 , put on a spectacular success when it hosted the @entity306			2
however , players and fans would face similar problems with heat as in @entity8 if the competition is held there			0
@entity312 ( 2022 bidder ) twenty years after jointly hosting @entity3 's first @entity11 , @entity312 wanted to do it again			1
along with @entity314 , @entity312 was a worthy destination in 2002 , but , like with the @entity289 , the recentness would probably work against them			1
@entity314 ( 2022 bidder ) similarly to @entity312 , @entity314 's joint host venture in 2002 is unlikely to aid them , although @entity321 will host the @entity322			1
@entity148 ( 2018 bidder ) @entity148 , a 2018 @entity11 bidder , have not hosted a @entity11 since 1966 , although it did showcase the @entity325 in 1996			0
it boasts top - class stadia and held the @entity327 to enormous success			0
tensions between the @entity330 and @entity10 could be a problem though			0
@entity332 and @entity333 ( 2018 bidder ) @entity332 hosted the @entity11 in 1982 and @entity333 delivered a vibrant @entity335			0
both countries , who bid for the 2018 competition , boast excellent stadia and a genuine footballing history			0
@entity341 and @entity342 ( 2018 bidder ) the two lowland countries launched a joint bid to host the 2018 @entity11			2
the pair hosted @entity347 , but the tournament was marred by hooliganism and that would count against them			0
the stadia @entity342 offered was also criticised .			0
