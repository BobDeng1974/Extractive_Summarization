@entity0 had predicted that the war which preceded his heavyweight encounter with @entity3 would be ‘ the fight of the night			1
the minor epic in which @entity6 put a stop – probably temporary – to the rise of @entity9 was indeed the fight of the night at the @entity11 in @entity13 ’s @entity12			0
but what @entity0 did not expect was to be booed to victory			1
so the complaints were not against the doctors and his corner deciding to spare him from further punishment			0
what dismayed the 15,700 capacity crowd – and the referee for that matter – was the manner of what masqueraded as a final eliminator to challenge his eminence @entity49 for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world			0
after a snappy start to proceedings @entity0 opted to settle into a repetitive pattern rather than finish off @entity3 with a burst of aggression			1
round after round @entity3 came plodding forward and the leaning tower of @entity59 picked him off with alternating left and right jabs , plus the occasional clubbing combination			1
@entity0 kept doing enough to win the rounds but did not extend himself to apply the knock out which was there for the taking			1
referee @entity66 put an absolute stop to the inaction in the eighth to warn them : ‘ either you fight or we go home			0
’ the crowd were heading for the exits soon after			0
perhaps @entity0 ’s reticence was rooted in the size of the prize at stake			1
he saw no need to risk a shock defeat which would have snatched the @entity31 bonanza from his grasp			1
it will not concern him yet that a performance like this would be unlikely to trouble @entity88 the @entity89			0
but the public were not best pleased			0
when they put a halt to proceedings so predictable that @entity3 clearly had no chance of winning , the arena gave a collective sigh of relief			1
@entity3 came out fast but was stopped in his tracks by @entity0 ’s first heavy right of the fight			1
@entity3 was a much fitter proposition for this rematch than in their first encounter three years ago			2
but then the stakes were higher now			0
he was working hard to get inside the towering @entity0 ’s long reach			1
this is as fit of body , sharp of mind and quick and accurate of punch as we have seen @entity0			2
at times he was smiling in admiration of his handiwork			0
@entity3 kept walking forward – into a variety of punches form the challenger for his @entity24 heavyweight title			1
@entity3 stumbles forward as he struggled to get any purchase on his punches while @entity0 throws out his jab from the first bell , @entity0 was on top and @entity3 failed to land a decisive blow over the 10 rounds he was in the fight both men were told to come together and fight but it was @entity0 's long range and his jab which kept him in control @entity0 was switching between left and right jabs and starting to land at will			1
when swayed out of range of a wild swing from @entity3 he turned to the crowd seeking applause for his remarkable athleticism for so huge a human being			2
@entity3 was caught with four big punches in short order and began backing away in alarm at @entity0 ’s power			1
the first decisive round was massively in favour of the @entity59 traveller			0
there are still times when @entity0 likes to amuse himself by changing the script even when it is in his favour			2
so he spent the start of the fourth letting @entity3 swarm over him in the ropes			2
then he unleashed a barrage of lefts and rights which staggered the @entity156 to win another round			0
@entity3 ’s face was beginning to swell but he took encouragement from connecting with one of his big right - hand swings			2
@entity0 then returned to picking him off			2
@entity3 kept coming – albeit more sluggishly			2
@entity0 kept landing the jabs from either wing			2
the crowd began to get a little restless and sporadic booing broke out as @entity0 ticked off another round			1
@entity0 , in a southpaw stance in these pictures , shows his height and reach advantage which allowed him to dominate all night @entity3 has his eye checked after being forced to take some heavy punishment from @entity0 's jab over the 10 rounds the fight is waved off after @entity3 's trainer @entity176 told his man that he wanted him to go out on his feet @entity0 called @entity3 a baby but was himself admonished by @entity66 for flicking @entity3 with the back of his right hand instead of punching correctly			1
‘ that ’s not boxing , ’ said the official , by now more of the crowd were in agreement with that sentiment			0
although this was child ’s play for @entity0 so far			0
if @entity3 ’s ears were closing as rapidly as his eyes he would not have heard the cat - calls			0
but there was no mistaking the referee ’s disapproval for the sporadic action			0
with @entity0 seemingly content now just to coast through the fight , @entity66 stopped the action completely and warned them both ; ‘ either you fight or we go home			0
’ so on we went , @entity3 peering through slits , @entity0 landing whenever the mood took him , albeit not often enough to entertain the 15,700 throng in the @entity11			1
@entity3 ’s belief was ebbing away and when he backed away @entity0 opened up a little			1
but not enough to close the show ? at least not by himself			0
the end of the round brought a medical consultation to @entity3 ’s corner and they pulled their half blind man out			1
he had not won a round and clearly had no chance of winning			0
fury is congratulated by his wife @entity219 after conserving his unbeaten record with victory over @entity3 in their underwhelming rematch fury locks lips with @entity219 and has barely a scratch on his face after a one - sided showing in @entity13 in the early hours of sunday morning			0

@entity0 dominated @entity3 from the first bell until he was pulled out after the 10th round
@entity0 controlled his opponent with his jab and never allowed @entity3 to trouble him on the inside
@entity3 's right eye was badly *damaged* and was almost shut when he was retired on his stool
@entity0 is now the *mandatory* challenger to world champion @entity31
