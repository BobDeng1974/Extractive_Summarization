by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 12:38 est , 3 july 2012 @entity4 anchor and talk show host @entity1 has publicly revealed he 's gay for the first time @entity1 has thanked fans for their support after his decision to come out as gay			1
the @entity4 news anchor was in @entity11 filming when his sexuality was made public for the first time			1
@entity1 wrote on @entity13 : ' i appreciate all the nice tweets			1
i am in @entity11 working but want to wish everyone a great 4th of july ! ' in an interview published yesterday , the journalist bluntly stated : ' the fact is , i 'm gay '			1
he said that he did not want people to think he is ' trying to hide something ' and that he is ' proud ' of who he is			0
in candid comments he said that he was taking a stand because ' the tide of history only advances when people make themselves fully visible '			0
the 45 - year - old added he was moved by recent events such as @entity31 's endorsement of gay marriage - and hopes his example will put an end to bullying			1
@entity1 's sexuality has long been an open secret in tv circles , but for him to state it publicly is a brave and bold move			1
he is also one of the most high profile people to come out in recent years , given that he hosts @entity4 's ' @entity42 ' and his own daytime tv talk show			1
@entity1 came out by giving permission for friend @entity45 , who is openly gay , to print an email exchange between them on the @entity48			1
in it he said : ' the fact is , i 'm gay , always have been , always will be , and i could n't be any more happy , comfortable with myself , and proud			0
' i have always been very open and honest about this part of my life with my friends , my family , and my colleagues			0
@entity1 has frequently been photographed with @entity57 , seen here shopping in the @entity58 with the news man in may 2010 ' i love , and i am loved ' he told @entity45 in the monday letter			1
here he and @entity57 ride bikes through @entity62 in july of 2010 ' in a perfect world , i do n't think it 's anyone else 's business , but i do think there is value in standing up and being counted			2
' i 'm not an activist , but i am a human being and i do n't give that up by being a journalist			2
' @entity1 says he was distressed he may be giving the impression that he had something to hide , when in fact he has lived openly among family and friends in the interview , @entity1 added that he did not address his sexuality in his memoir which he wrote in 2006 because it was about war reporting and he ' did n't set out to write about other aspects of my life '			1
he also long thought that being a journalist he should not become the story , so did not respond ' even when i 've been directly asked the ' gay question ''			2
what changed is that @entity1 now worries that he could be setting a bad example by not being honest with the public			1
he said : ' recently i 've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle			0
' it 's become clear to me that by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long , i have given some the mistaken impression that i am trying to hide something - something that makes me uncomfortable , ashamed or even afraid			0
' this is distressing because it is simply not true			0
' i 've also been reminded recently that while as a society we are moving toward greater inclusion and equality for all people , the tide of history only advances when people make themselves fully visible			0
