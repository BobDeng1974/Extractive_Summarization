frontline : @entity1 , pictured here on @entity4 beach in @entity5 on march 1 1944 , was the first journalist to report on the @entity7 surrender in @entity8 in the final moments of @entity8 in @entity11 , @entity9 correspondent @entity1 gave his news agency perhaps the biggest scoop in its history			1
he reported - a full day ahead of the competition - that the @entity7 had surrendered unconditionally at a former schoolhouse in @entity17 , @entity18			1
for this , he was publicly rebuked by the @entity9 , and then fired			1
@entity1 had defied military censors to get the story out			1
@entity22 and @entity24 president @entity23 had agreed to suppress news of the capitulation for 36 hours in order to allow @entity28 to stage a second surrender ceremony in @entity30			1
@entity1 was accused of breaking a pledge that he and 16 other journalists had made to keep the surrender a secret for a time , as a condition of being allowed to witness it firsthand			1
67 years later , the @entity9 's top executive is apologizing for the way the company treated @entity1			1
' it was a terrible day for the @entity9 it was handled in the worst possible way , ' said president and ceo @entity43			1
@entity1 , he said , ' did everything just right			2
' @entity43 rejected the notion that the @entity9 had a duty to obey the order to hold the story once it was clear the embargo was for political reasons , rather than to protect the troops			1
' once the war is over , you ca n't hold back information like that			0
the world needed to know , ' he said in an interview			0
@entity59 , daughter of former @entity9 @entity60 bureau chief @entity1 , points to her father in a picture taken during the @entity7 surrender in 1945 , at her home in @entity65 , @entity66			1
@entity43 , who is retiring this year , has also co-written an introduction to @entity1 's newly published memoir , @entity68 : @entity69			2
scoop : the @entity70 on may 8 , 1945 , showing news of the end of the war in @entity11 @entity1 , who died in a traffic accident in 1963 , had long sought such public vindication from his old employer			1
his daughter , @entity59 , of @entity65 , @entity66 , said she was " overjoyed " by the apology			0
' i think it would have meant a lot to him , ' she said			0
the @entity7 surrender happened at 2.41 am on may 7 , 1945			2
@entity1 was one of 17 reporters taken to witness the ceremony			2
he and the others were hastily assembled by military commanders , then pledged to secrecy by a @entity24 general while the group flew over @entity18			2
as a condition of being allowed to see the surrender in person , the correspondents were barred from reporting what they had witnessed until authorised by @entity96 headquarters			2
initially , the journalists were told the news would be held up for only a few hours			2
but after the surrender was complete , the embargo was extended for 36 hours - until 3 pm the following day			1
' the absurdity of attempting to bottle up news of such magnitude was too apparent , ' he would later write			0
@entity1 , centre left , with the @entity9 @entity60 staff in the early hours of may 18 , 1945 before returning to @entity24 nevertheless , he initially stayed quiet			1
then , at 2.03 pm , , the surrender was announced by @entity7 officials , via a radio broadcast from @entity109 , a city already in @entity96 hands			0
that meant , @entity1 knew , that the transmission had been authorised by the same military censors gagging the press			2
@entity115 , @entity1 went to see the chief @entity24 censor and told him there was no way he could continue to hold the story			2
the military had broken its side of the pact by allowing the @entity7 to announce the surrender			0
and there were no military secrets at stake			0
the censor waved him off			0
@entity1 thought about it for 15 minutes , and then acted			2
he used a military phone , not subject to monitoring by censors , to dispatch his account to the @entity9 's @entity136 bureau			2
notably , he did n't brief his own editors about the embargo or his decision to dodge the censors			0
the @entity9 put the story on the wire within minutes			2
to some of @entity1 's competitors , the scoop was a betrayal on the scale of @entity148			2
compounding their anger , military censors continued to refuse to allow any other news organization to send their own stories , meaning the @entity9 would continue to have an exclusive for a day			1
@entity59 , points to her father in a picture taken during the @entity7 surrender on may 7 , 1945 ' i am browned off , fed up , burnt up and put out , ' wrote @entity158 , a @entity70 correspondent			2
he called the suppression of the story ' the most colossal " snafu " in the history of the war			0
' his newspaper followed with an editorial chastising the @entity9 for initially boasting of a historic ' news beat			1
' ' if it was a " beat " , ' the paper wrote , ' it was one only because mr. @entity1 's sixteen colleagues chose to stand by their commitments			0
the military briefly suspended the @entity9 's ability to dispatch any news from the @entity11 theatre			1
when that ban was lifted , more than 50 of @entity1 's fellow war correspondents signed a protest letter asking that it be reinstated			0
the military expelled @entity1 from @entity18			1
@entity179 also came from the @entity9 's president at the time , @entity180			0
' the @entity9 profoundly regrets the distribution on monday of the report of the total surrender in @entity11 which investigation now clearly discloses was distributed in advance of authorization by @entity187 , ' he said in a public statement on may 10			1
@entity1 's report in the @entity70 , left , and the cover of @entity68 , the book remembering him the @entity9 's general manager , @entity191 , said @entity1 should have conferred with his editors about the decision to publish			1
later , he addressed a letter to the reporter saying that he had violated a ' cardinal principle ' of journalism by breaking a pledge to keep the surrender confidential			0
' no employee of the @entity9 has the right to disregard what is defined by the source as a pledge of confidence , when he knows that those who meant to impose it still hold it to be in force , ' he said			0
in an essay in @entity213 , published may 19 , 1945 , under the subhead ' the @entity9 surrender , ' @entity211 absolved @entity1 of breaking the ' pledge ' he had supposedly made aboard the aircraft flying to @entity17			1
' whether a promise extorted as this one was , in an airplane several thousand feet up , has any moral force is a question for the theologians , ' @entity211 wrote			0
' i suppose that @entity1 should have refused to promise anything and thus made sure of missing an event that no newspaperman in the world would want to miss. ' apology : @entity43 , president and ceo of @entity9 , says @entity1 ' did everything right ' @entity232 , the @entity9 reporter who succeeded @entity1 in @entity11 and became the general manager after @entity191 , strongly supported his colleague and believed he had done the right thing			1
according to the memoir , @entity232 told @entity23 's successor , president @entity237 : ' if i 'd been @entity1 , i 'd have done the same thing - except that i 'd have telephoned you first			1
' after being fired by the @entity9 , @entity1 took a job as managing editor of the @entity242 in @entity243 , and then went on to become publisher of the @entity245			1
he died at age 58 after being struck by a car			0
@entity1 wrote the war memoir before his death			0
his family held on to the manuscript for decades before his daughter , @entity59 , began looking for a publisher			0
she said that even though she was only 16 when her father died , she got the impression he still took great joy in his career , despite the episode			0
' some people said after the war , " oh , @entity1 is a broken man			0
he 's out there editing some little newspaper in @entity243			0
" i think people had this idea that he was feeling sorry for himself			0
he was n't the kind of person who sat around and felt sorry , ' she said			0
@entity43 said @entity1 's daughter approached him around the same time he had become interested in the matter while helping with work on the book @entity273 : how the @entity9 has covered war , peace , and @entity276			1
the publication of @entity1 's memoir prompted the @entity9 's apology , @entity43 said			1
he called @entity1 's dismissal ' a great , great tragedy ' and hailed him and the desk editors who put the surrender story on the wire for upholding the highest principles of journalism			1
' they did the right thing , ' @entity43 said			0
' they stood up to power			0
