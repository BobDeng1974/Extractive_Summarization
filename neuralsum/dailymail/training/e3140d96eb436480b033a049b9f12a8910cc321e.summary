' in a bit of electoral irony , the @entity11 calculated the @entity15 presidential nominee amassed 47.2 per cent of the full presidential vote , or 48 per cent when considering only him and @entity17			2
oops : @entity1 said during the campaign 47 per cent of @entity6 people would never vote for him because they were entitlement - obsessed people who did n't care about lower taxes he said what ? @entity1 remarked of the 47 per cent who would never vote for him , ' my job is not to worry about those people ' @entity25 : @entity1 's remark , which many think torpedoed his changes on @entity29 , was caught by a hidden camera @entity1 had presaged that the @entity33 incumbent would - in fact - be the candidate to cull that particular percentage , when he told a cabal of fat cat donors that nearly half of @entity6 would never vote for him - or his policies			1
' and they will vote for this president no matter what … these are people who pay no income tax ' that 47 per cent of the @entity6 electorate , he said , represent those , ' who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you - name - it			1
' that that 's an entitlement			0
and the government should give it to them			0
and they will vote for this president no matter what … these are people who pay no income tax			0
' ' my job is not to worry about those people , ” @entity1 said in the vexing video			2
“ i ’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives			0
' some believe @entity1 's biting rejoinder , captured on a hidden camera and later posted to the @entity80 , torpedoed his bid for the presidency			2
@entity1 's remark regarding 47 per cent of @entity6 was captured during a closed - door @entity85 fundraiser for fat cat donors @entity1 later reportedly said he was speaking ' off the cuff ' and replying to a question when he issued the acerbic address he apparently made the unfortunate remarks at a closed - door @entity85 fundraiser while on the campaign trail during the summer , or well before november 's @entity29			1
@entity1 later reportedly said he was speaking ' off the cuff ' and replying to a question when he issued the acerbic address			0
' it ’s a question and answer , as i recall , about the process of the campaign and how i ’m going to get the 51 or 52 per cent i need , and i point out it ’s by focusing on those folks that are neither in [ @entity17 's ] camp nor in my camp , ' @entity1 said			1
close shave : @entity17 , for his part , notched 51.03 per cent of the popular vote in the 2012 @entity6 presidential election ' i recognize that among those that pay no tax , approximately 47 percent of @entity6 , i ’m not likely to be highly successful with the message of lowering taxes			1
' that ’s not as attractive to those who do n’t pay income taxes as it is to those who do , ' @entity1 reportedly said in explanation			1
' and likewise those who are reliant on government are not as attracted to my message of slimming down the size of government			0
and so i then focus on those individuals who i believe are most likely to be able to be pulled into my camp and help me win the 51 or 50.1 percent that i need to become the next president			0
' @entity17 , for his part , recorded 51.03 per cent of the popular vote .			0

@entity1 was *overheard* saying 47 per cent of @entity6 would never vote for him because such government - reliant ' victims ' did n't care about lower taxes
