by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political reporter published : 18:27 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 18:44 est , 15 june 2013 @entity4 has agreed to change his controversial @entity6 referendum blueprint amid fears the original plans could unfairly produce a ‘ stay in ’ result			1
the prime minister has bowed to @entity12 pressure and revised the crucial ‘ in / out ’ question to be put to the nation if he wins the next election			2
the alteration will see voters asked if the @entity18 should ‘ be ’ in the @entity6 , rather than ‘ remain ’ as in the original wording			1
u turn : @entity4 bowed to @entity12 pressure and revised the crucial ' in / out ' question to be put to the nation if he wins the next election the change will be confirmed this week when @entity24 mp @entity23 publishes a @entity25 to guarantee mr @entity4 ’s promise to hold the referendum by the end of 2017			1
in a highly unusual move for a backbench mp ’s legislation , the prime minister and foreign secretary @entity32 will sponsor the proposals to prove their commitment to a referendum			2
former defence secretary @entity36 , a leading figure of the @entity38 , and @entity40 sir @entity39 will also put their names to the @entity25 in a concerted effort to show the party is united on the referendum plan			2
@entity46 , chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of backbench mps , is also sponsoring the @entity25			0
mr @entity4 has been blocked from introducing the referendum plan by his @entity51 partners			2
the @entity1 has learned that as well as throwing his weight behind the @entity25 , the prime minister privately agreed that the referendum question should be changed			1
support : @entity57 mp mr @entity23 said he was pleased to have the prime minister 's support on his bill			0
he said he is fighting to put a fair question to the @entity18 people in proposals published last month , voters were asked : ‘ do you think that the @entity18 should remain a member of the @entity6 ? ’ but after @entity68 privately protested that the word ‘ remain ’ would prompt voters to stay in , the wording has been changed			1
a source said : ‘ instead of “ do you want to remain in the @entity6 ” it will simply ask voters if they want to “ be ” in the @entity6			1
it ’s a more neutral , fairer question			0
’ last night , experts said the change could be crucial			0
@entity76 , of pollsters @entity77 , said : ‘ the original question set out last month gave us 51 per cent in favour of leaving the @entity6 and 49 per cent against in a survey			1
' that ’s a statistical dead - heat			0
but the rephrasing could tip the balance further in favour of leaving the @entity6			2
’ the change has been made even though mr @entity4 believes that @entity18 should remain in a reformed @entity6			1
@entity57 mp mr @entity23 said last night : ‘ i ’m extremely pleased that @entity4 is backing this important @entity25 , and that we have been able to make the changes we needed to ensure it ’s a fair question that we put to the @entity18 people			1
’ spat : @entity24 chairman @entity91 ( pictured left ) said @entity93 was ' too weak ' to give his mps s ay after the @entity97 leader urged his colleagues to abstain from voting but sources confirmed the wording of any referendum would be vetted by the @entity103 before being put to the people			0
@entity24 mps see legislating now for a post-election referendum as a vital sign to voters that mr @entity4 will keep his word if he is re-elected			0
however , with both the @entity110 and @entity97 opposed to mr @entity23 ’s proposals , the @entity25 is unlikely to become law even it clears its initial commons hurdle			0
labour leader @entity93 has urged his mps not to take part in the first vote on the referendum plans due next month , with party sources dismissing the @entity25 as a ‘ gimmick ’			0
that sparked accusations from @entity24 chairman @entity91 that mr @entity93 was ‘ too weak ’ to give his mps , let alone the public , a say .			0

changed the question from should the @entity18 ' remain ' in the @entity6 to should the @entity18 ' be ' in the @entity6
referendum is to be held by the end of 2017
