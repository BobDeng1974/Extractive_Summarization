by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 glory be , @entity3 not only won a one - day match against @entity6 at @entity7 on friday but did so with a flair that had appeared beyond them after three thumping 50 - over defeats			1
the series may have been lost but this was anything but a dead rubber for @entity13 and an @entity3 side who desperately needed a victory			1
@entity3 have not suddenly turned into @entity18 contenders but their 41 - run win in the final one - day international was proof , perhaps , that their methods can work in modern one - day cricket			2
majestic : @entity25 inspired @entity3 to victory with a magnificent knock of 113 against @entity6 at @entity7 on song : @entity25 scored at a quick pace and helped @entity3 set a competitive total at @entity7 on friday respite : @entity3 captain @entity13 has come under pressure to resign but managed to record a win quick - fire : @entity3 batsman @entity25 scored a rapid 49 to help @entity3 post a score of 294 - 7 at @entity7 impressive : @entity3 's @entity36 ( second right ) took three wickets to help bowl @entity6 out at @entity7 resistance : @entity40 added runs to @entity6 's total at the end but he quickly ran out of batting partners @entity13 said : ‘ it ’s frustrating			1
if we play like that we ’ll win a lot more games			0
we have n’t had the wrong tactics , we ’ve had guys not doing their jobs very well in the last three games			0
they did them well today			0
‘ the bottom line is we ’ve lost another series and there are more questions than answers but i ’d rather win the @entity18 than this series			0
we ’ve got a great opportunity to work at our one - day game and the improvement we can make is scary			0
that ’s what we ’ve got to get our heads round now			0
’ @entity6 ’s attitude could be summed up by the sight of them taking delivery of a @entity71 ’s takeaway during thusday ’s practice session			2
whether @entity3 were dining on quinoa and mung beans instead is unclear but they certainly looked fitter and , yes , more dynamic yesterday			0
@entity13 was timing the ball better than at almost any other time this summer on a cracking @entity7 pitch			0
he lost @entity78 , and @entity79 , promoted to three on the back of his display at @entity82 but caught at third man here			2
it was when @entity25 joined @entity13 that @entity3 really began to produce the one - day batting needed to take the attack to @entity6			1
@entity13 , leading @entity3 in a record 63rd one - day international , failed to make the most of another good start and when @entity92 struggled it appeared that spin would again undo @entity3			2
@entity92 ’s form remains one of @entity3 ’s biggest worries moving towards the @entity18 and it was almost a relief when he was out			0
@entity25 was in sensational @entity98 form all summer and it now looks as though he would take over the one - day captaincy should the selectors decide that a new leader is needed before february ’s @entity18			1
frustration : @entity6 captain @entity103 trudges off the field after losing his wicket at @entity7 on friday all smiles : @entity107 ( right ) bowled well as @entity3 kept the pressure on @entity6 and took wickets regularly half - century : @entity110 ( right ) scored 53 to try and push @entity6 to victory but they lost wickets regularly together : @entity3 captain @entity13 ( centre ) gives a team talk during the @entity116 at @entity7 the odds favour @entity13 staying but @entity25 is emerging as the captain - elect in all forms of the game			1
he again looked a class act here in leading @entity3 to a competitive total			2
@entity124 is another who has not been at his best in this series but he was the catalyst for @entity3 ’s eventual riches of 294 for seven by loosening @entity6 ’s spin stranglehold			1
as @entity25 and @entity124 attacked , @entity6 ’s bowlers started to lose their immaculate line and length and the runs flowed			1
the pair added 107 for the fifth wicket in 14 overs before @entity124 sloppily ran himself out			0
luckily , @entity36 — in chronic international batting form almost ever since his breakthrough hundred in @entity139 — also threw off the shackles to support @entity25			2
@entity142 went to his second one - day international century with the second of three sixes but did not see the job through			0
he handed @entity146 the first of his two wickets before @entity36 took the initiative with an unbeaten 33 off 23 balls with two sixes of his own			0
it left @entity6 with a chase well within their compass but once @entity156 removed @entity157 with the third ball of the innings to take his first wicket of the series they always looked like coming off second best			1
while @entity103 was there @entity6 had hope but when he toe - ended a wide delivery from @entity107 to cover the game was up , even though @entity40 ’s 87 made sure @entity6 went down with all guns blazing			1
the series was lost 3 - 1 but it is a start for @entity3			1
meanwhile , @entity169 has been ruled out of @entity3 ’s @entity171 match against @entity6 at @entity82 on @entity172 a shoulder injury .			1

@entity25 scored magnificent 113 to give @entity3 total of 294 - 7
root first @entity177 to score @entity98 and odi centuries at @entity7
@entity124 also helped @entity3 to total with quick - fire 49 at @entity7
@entity6 bowled out for *253* despite @entity40 's ( 87 ) resistance
@entity110 ( 53 ) top - scored for @entity6 but **tourists** lost wickets regularly
@entity79 , @entity107 and @entity156 take two wickets apiece
@entity36 the pick of @entity3 's bowlers , taking three @entity191 wickets
@entity6 had already won series before match and it finishes 3 - 1 to **tourists**
