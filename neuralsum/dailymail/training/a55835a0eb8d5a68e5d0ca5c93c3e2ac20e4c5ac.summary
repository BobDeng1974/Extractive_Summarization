fancy travelling back to 16th century @entity1 ? then follow these instructions			1
first , visit the @entity4 ’s gripping exhibition of paintings by the forgotten @entity7 master @entity6 , which opens in @entity9 on 25 october			1
this done , spend a few days in @entity11 , the wonderfully preserved city in northern @entity1 where @entity6 did much of his best work			1
a northern star : @entity14 sits close to @entity15 , but is often unfairly caught in the shadow of its giant neighbour let ’s deal with the artist first			1
it is hardly surprising that his name has been eclipsed by such titanic near - contemporaries as @entity25 and @entity26			1
yet his gifts , particularly as a portraitist , would have shone in any time or place			1
neither meanly realist nor rollickingly mannerist , his paintings of aristocrats and artisans are truly magnificent			1
after a glance , for instance , at the portrait of @entity37 ( 1560 ) , you ’ll want to know more about the subject			1
but you ’ll feel you know quite a bit already			1
a short man , to judge by his head - body ratio , he glares pugnaciously out at posterity			1
you get a similar feeling from the picture of @entity49 , aka @entity50 in @entity51 , who is another angry nobleman			2
his sword ’s at a tilt			2
his hand ’s on its hilt			2
his cheeks match the blush of his doublet and hose , as if to say : ' that ’s right , they ’re pink			2
you want to make something out of it ? ' wander the streets of @entity11 today , and you feel you might meet these characters on any cobbled corner			2
the town is a time capsule , all the more so because it has n’t been over run by tourists			2
the @entity14 ( the higher , older part ) floats above the rest like @entity72 ’s plateau in @entity73 , protected from modernity by its thick defensive walls			2
the town has money from the textiles and mechanical parts factories that surround the suburbs			0
it does n’t need your dog - eared tourist euro			0
what this means is that you will have a more authentic @entity1 experience than you could conceivably hope for among the touts of @entity87 , or the rapacious gondoliers who patrol the @entity91 canals			0
brushstrokes : @entity93 produced masterpieces such as @entity95 ( the tailor ) if you are staying in the lower town – as i did , in the friendly @entity98 hotel – you rise to the higher part in a funicular , and emerge into another age			0
nor are the @entity104 , of which the town has many , the limit of @entity14 ’s artistic repertoire			0
other highlights , as well as religious works by @entity111 and @entity112 , include an impeccable technicolour altarpiece by @entity114 in the church of @entity116 , and the same artist ’s exquisite marquetry panels in the church of @entity120 , which glow as if in amber			1
while you ’re there , pay your respects to the tomb of @entity126 , a @entity127 native			0
if his operas are your thing , the nearby @entity128 stages them regularly			0
just one cornetto , though , wo n’t be enough for afters – particularly if you are indulging in the stracciatella at @entity137 restaurant , where the delicious ice - cream , flecked with splinters of dark chocolate , was invented			0
the foodies among you ( and the greedies , such as myself ) wo n’t be disappointed by @entity14			0
local specialities include fine cheeses ( try the creamy taleggio ) and casoncelli pasta , a kind of ravioli filled with meat and raisins , glazed with sage butter and draped with bacon			0
round off this excess with a glass or two of fortified moscato di scanzo			0
to sum up , @entity14 is , as it were , the @entity157 among @entity1 towns : overlooked , undervalued , its treasures small but perfectly formed			0
but with @entity162 flights from several @entity164 airports to @entity11 airport , a mere three miles or so from the town centre , there is no reason not to go			1
@entity162 ( www.ryanair.com ) flies to @entity11 from @entity169 , from £ 40 return			0
double rooms at the @entity98 ( 0039 035 4222 711 , www.bwhotelcappellodoro-bg.it ) start at £ 98 @entity173			0
the @entity4 ’s @entity6 exhibition runs from 25 october 25 2014 to 25 january 2015 , adult standard entry £ 12 ( www.royalacademy.org.uk ) .			1
