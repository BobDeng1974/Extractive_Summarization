@entity4 miracle : @entity11 staff hold the newborn puppy and its mother veterinarian dr @entity23 wrote on the shelter ’s @entity25 page : ‘ a quick exam showed that the puppy she was trying to have was far too large to fit			1
she needed an emergency c - section and she needed it now			0
it was obvious the puppy had been stuck for a long time			2
‘ there was a lot of infection and very little chance for the puppy			2
however , we always try to save puppies and kittens born by c - section and the veterinary technicians went to work , but the puppy never breathed , never moved			2
’ what happened next left the staff at the shelter in a state of disbelief			0
remarkable : the puppy did n't respond to vets at first , but eventually sprang to life the puppy was assumed to be dead and the technicians worked to clear the mother of infection , then they heard a startling sound			0
dr @entity23 explained that as they stirred the mother from anesthesia 45 minutes later a crying noise began emanating from the blanket the puppy was wrapped in			0
