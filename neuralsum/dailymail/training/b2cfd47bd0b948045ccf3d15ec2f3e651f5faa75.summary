by @entity0 published : 14:17 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 14:17 est , 23 november 2012 sick : @entity1 , a normally very friendly cat , has now lost her eye because of the attack a cat has been left partially blinded after unknown abusers cruelly superglued her tail to her eye			1
owner @entity9 was shocked when her five - year - old pet @entity1 came home with the skin above and below her left eye ripped off			1
@entity9 , 25 , took her straight to the vets where @entity1 was kept in overnight before undergoing surgery but her eye was so badly damaged it had to be removed			1
now police and @entity20 officers are looking for the culprits responsible and are appealing for information			1
' @entity1 does n't usually wander away for too long but she had been been missing for a few days and when she came home , i was just so shocked at what i saw , ' said distraught @entity9 , from @entity27 , near @entity28			1
' her eye was nearly falling out and there was superglue on her @entity31 was obvious what had happened			0
the vets did what they could but @entity1 's eye was in an awful state and they could n't save it			1
' i 'm so upset because she must have suffered terribly but i 'm also fuming			0
i want to find out who 's done this and stop it happening again			0
' i ca n't believe anyone could be so cruel to a defenceless animal			0
@entity1 is such a friendly cat			1
whoever did this is sick , they 're not even human			0
' if children were responsible then perhaps , if they were in a group , one of them will realise how serious this is ands come forward			0
' i 've been told about a similar incident involving a cat in @entity27 , it had similar injuries but this cat died			0
it also happened to my nanna 's cat two years ago when its tail was superglued to its back			2
' she 's still quite jumpy , but i 'm trying to encourage her to get used to going outside again , ' added @entity9 , who has reported the incident to the @entity20			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity20 said : ' we have been made aware of this incident and we are looking into it and have been liaising with the police			2
' ' this is an appalling thing to do to an animal which would have been in extreme pain and we desperately want help to find whoever was responsible			0
