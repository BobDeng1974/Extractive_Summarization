at @entity1 he will provide competition for first - choice keeper @entity32 while helping to fill the gap left by the departed @entity63 , who has joined @entity64			1
nice coach @entity65 on saturday night confirmed @entity3 's move to @entity23 had been ratified and told @entity14 fans they could expect some ' quality ' displays from the new signing			1
speaking to @entity71 after @entity5 's friendly defeat to @entity73 , @entity65 said : ' it 's confirmed , yes			0
' it 's a good affair for @entity1 because he 's a very good player			2
you will see next season the quality of this player			0
' it 's fantastic for him			0
it 's important for him to try another league , another club and @entity1 is a fantastic club for him			2
' @entity3 can take the goalkeeping position at @entity1 because his qualities are very strong and ... ' magnifique '			1
you saw in the @entity9 how important a goalkeeper he is			2
for me , @entity3 can impose his quality , he 's a goalkeeper who is very good with the feet , with his arms , he knows football and he 's a very , very good player			2
' another player expected to move to the @entity11 is @entity96 defender @entity95 , with a £ 16million deal understood to be under discussion			0
good old days : @entity13 speaks to @entity99 ahead of @entity1 's friendly against @entity100 it was believed that the 25 - year - old was initially pinpointed as a ready - made replacement for back - up keeper @entity63 , who recently joined @entity64 , with @entity32 the current no 1 at the club			1
however , @entity13 has insisted that performances will dictate who holds the no 1 position this season at the club , as @entity34 looks to stake a claim for a first - team spot			2

@entity3 will join @entity119 and @entity120 as new signings at the @entity11 next season , while the club has also been linked with a move for @entity126 's £ 35 million - rated defensive midfielder @entity125			1
another level : the signing of @entity119 shows that @entity1 can compete in the transfer market @entity13 believes that the new additions the club has made now means they will make a sustained challenge for the @entity134 title this season , after falling somewhat short over the last few years			1
speaking at a press conference ahead of his side 's pre-season friendly with @entity100 , @entity13 agreed that @entity1 were looking to repeat the success they have enjoyed in the past			0
' that 's what our target is but still i think we have been very consistent , ' he said			0
