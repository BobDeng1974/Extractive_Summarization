heart attack victims can enjoy a healthy recovery if they look on the bright side of life , research found heart attack victims can enjoy a healthy recovery if they look on the bright side of life , research found			1
pessimists who grumble through life were twice as likely to suffer another heart attack , require surgery or even die , compared with more cheerful patients			2
that is according to a group of scientists at @entity17 who spent four years studying the mental attitudes of 369 patients admitted to hospital with unstable angina and heart attacks			1
while it is widely known that optimism is linked to better heart health , this is the first study to look at the impact of a patient ’s attitude after suffering a heart attack			1
the team said their findings could be linked to physical and psychological impacts of being optimistic , such as smoking and healthy eating			1
smoking has long been known to be a major risk factor for heart attack and angina , with an estimated 22,000 deaths each year from cardiovascular disease linked to smoking			1
and this study showed that half of the most pessimistic patients who smoked were still smoking on year after going into hospital			0
by contrast , 85 per cent of optimistic smokers kicked the habit entirely			0
positive patients are also more likely to aid their recovery by eating more fruit and vegetables after their incident – some 40 per cent of them ate the recommended five - a - day , compared with just 20 per cent of pessimists			0
however , the study did find that optimistic patients were no more likely to do more exercise than pessimists			0
lead author of the research , professor @entity61 , said : ‘ our research shows that optimistic people are more likely to take advice about lifestyle changes on board , like quitting smoking and eating more healthily – this results in better outcomes after a patient suffers from unstable angina or a heart attack			1
in the @entity74 , 2.3 million people are living with coronary heart disease , the major cause of heart attacks and unstable angina ‘ our findings could be used to identify pessimistic patients and encourage them to make the necessary changes to their lifestyle that can ultimately lead to better health			2
’ dr @entity85 , associate medical director of the @entity86 , added : ‘ suffering from a serious condition like angina or heart attack can take a drastic emotional toll , which we know can lead to depression , further lowering the chances of a full recovery after a heart attack			0
‘ if you ’re living with a heart condition and struggling to cope , we would urge you to contact your gp who can put you in touch with the necessary support			0
’ @entity101 has also been linked to poor outcomes for heart patients			2
these findings discovered that pessimistic patients were twice as likely to have depressive symptoms a year after suffering a heart attack or unstable angina			1
the experts hope their study will help identify the patients most at risk of suffering serious health complications in the years after recovering from heart problems			2
