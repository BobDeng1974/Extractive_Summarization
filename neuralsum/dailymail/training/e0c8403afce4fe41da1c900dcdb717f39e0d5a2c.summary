a shaft of sunlight slants across the yoga shala ( ' studio ' to the uninitiated )			1
and relish the opportunity provided by @entity7 to spend much of the day without mindless chitchat , in blissful , soothing silence			1
putting your back into it : the @entity7 offers yoga breaks in a restored chateau in southern @entity15 but @entity16 is no hair - shirt monastery — it 's a boho chateau in southern @entity15 and new breed of retreat : simple and deeply spiritual , yet with oodles of style and plenty of creature comforts			1
there are no trendy yoga hybrids here and no corpulent spa menus stuffed with ' journeys ' and ' rituals '			1
straight hatha yoga and meditation are the main course , not an after - thought sandwiched either side of sunbathing by the pool			2
a wonderful place to stretch body and soul : the chateau has the feel of a ' vast , ancient temple ' the house has the feel of a vast , ancient temple			1
the bedrooms have a certain monastic simplicity - uncluttered and candlelit - but they are huge and look as if they 've been styled by @entity49			2
mine has a pared - back safari insouciance with a zebra throw on the carved wooden day - bed and a rocking lion guarding the freestanding bath			2
the one next door has a @entity57 air with a hammam - style bathroom			2
the food also dances a clever line between hip and healthy			0
@entity63 , mainly raw , dairy / grain and sugar free ; you 'd think it would be gloomy on the eye and turgid on the palate			0
instead flavours are light and bright and the presentation is artful - salads are turned into mandalas and chia porridge comes studded with star - bright blue borage and a swirl of freshly made compote			0
every day ends with a pudding that tastes decadent , but which , the owner , @entity81 promises , is guilt - free			0
come find yourself : as well as yoga sessions , the retreat offers day trips and oddly decadent puddings you can spend your free time softly swinging in a hammock , but there are chances to break outside the walls			1
one afternoon we took a trip to @entity94 - le - @entity93 , of @entity96 fame ; on another we sat sipping chai and listening to mantras in a hilltop @entity100 castle			0
come the full moon , we built a fire on the shore of a nearby lake and had a moonlight dip before watching the flames for our evening meditation			0
@entity7 could be horribly smug and self - satisfied , but is n't			0
if this is the future of yoga retreats , count me in			0

the retreat is in a restored chateau that feels like a ' vast , ancient temple '
