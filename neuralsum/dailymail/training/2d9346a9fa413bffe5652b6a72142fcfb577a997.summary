by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 02:48 est , 1 march 2013 a gang of yobs who fired a ' bb gun ' in the street came face - to - face with the real thing when armed police swooped on them armed with submachine guns			1
the two boys and three girls sparked terror in @entity15 city centre when they were spotted brandishing the gun - which reportedly looked like a pistol - and began shooting at a building			1
but they soon had problems of their own after 999 operators sent in police marksmen armed with @entity22 submachine - guns - capable of firing up to 800 rounds - per - minute - to arrest them			2
the scenes were captured by professional cameraman @entity51 , 45 , who was walking past when the swoop unfolded			0
he said : ' a police car came to a screaming stop , two officers got out armed with guns and i just reached for my mobile phone			1
contained : officers pinned the youngsters down and cuffed them before establishing that the fake weapon posed no threat response : the forceful response demonstrates how seriously the police treat reports of the use of firearms aftermath : police clear up as the youngsters are taken away			1
@entity74 and @entity75 police have warned others against the use of firearms ' by the time i 'd got it ready they had the kids on the floor			0
i know they have to take firearm reports seriously , but it was still a shock because it 's not normally something you see in the centre of @entity15			2
' following the incident on january 10 three girls were later returned home and the two boys , both aged 17 , were arrested on suspicion of a public order offence			0
one was dealt with by restorative justice while no action was taken against the other			0
@entity74 and @entity99 issued a warning that anyone carrying weapons - fake or real - would be dealt with by armed officers .			0
