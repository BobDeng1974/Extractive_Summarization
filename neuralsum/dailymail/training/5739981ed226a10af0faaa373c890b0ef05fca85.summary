scientists have controversially claimed that life on @entity2 originated in space after plankton were found on the exterior of the @entity6 earlier this week cosmonauts announced they had found the microorganisms living on one of the windows of the @entity12 segment of the space station			1
and while the exact origin of these critters is still unknown , it has been claimed they may have come from outer space - supposedly like life on @entity2			1
professor @entity18 is best known as the only scientist to argue against evolution during the 1981 @entity22 legal case against the teaching of creationism in schools			1
now he claims that plankton on the @entity6 came from outer space and not from @entity2 experiments have previously shown bacteria can survive outside our planet , but this is thought to be the first time more complex life has been found this far out in space			1
their exact origin is not yet known and will require further study - although it may just be contamination from the @entity41 segment of the @entity6 at the time of the discovery @entity12 experts said the tiny organisms were carried to the station on air currents from the sea where plankton is found in abundance			1
however others claim this is impossible , with another explanation being that the minute plants drifted onto the @entity6 from elsewhere in space			2
a controversial academic from the @entity57 has claimed that plankton supposedly found on the exterior of the @entity6 ( pictured ) earlier this week are proof that life on @entity2 is of extraterrestrial origin			1
professor @entity18 says the plankton must have come from outer space professor @entity18 is a leading proponent of panspermia , the hypothesis that life exists throughout the universe and is spread by asteroids and comets , in addition to simply drifting through the cosmos			1
@entity73 proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space , such as extremophiles , become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life			0
these life - forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks			0
if met with ideal conditions on a new planet 's surfaces , the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins , it is believed			0
they insist this supports theories that plankton - one of the earliest forms of life - must have originally fallen to earth from space billions of years ago			2
and say this is proof that we are all of extraterrestrial origin , a theory known as panspermia			1
professor @entity18 , of the @entity109 , said algae - like organisms , or diatoms , have previously been found on meteorites which have fallen to @entity2			1
' diatoms have been found on meteorites in @entity115 , but there has been no proof where they actually came from , ' he said			0
' this is the first time that we have evidence that points towards complex living organisms falling from the skies to @entity2			2
' the space station is orbiting the earth in a total vacuum , there is no air , so it is a total defiance of the laws of physics to say these organisms were blown into space from @entity2			1
' the only explanation is that they have come from elsewhere in space , and this supports long - held theories that plankton , and therefore all life on @entity2 including humans , originated from organisms in space			1
' everything that we have on the @entity2 is derived from space , including humans			2
' @entity12 's launches into space take place from the @entity150 in @entity151 experts had claimed that the plankton were not carried there at launch and must have been blown their on air currents , because they are marine microorganisms not indigenous to the @entity12 launch site in @entity151			1

the 74 - year - old @entity115 - born @entity170 mathematician obtained a phd from @entity172 under the supervision of the late sir @entity174			0
the pair went on to collaborate on a body of work some credit with providing the basis of the field of astrobiology			0
their joint work on the infrared spectra of interstellar grains led to developing the hypothesis of panspermia , which proposes that cosmic dust in space and comets is partly organic - and may have ' seeded ' life on @entity2			1
they further contended that extraterrestrial life forms continue to enter the @entity2 's atmosphere , and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks , new diseases , and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution			2
in 2003 he was joint signatory on a letter sent to @entity201 which suggested that the virus which causes @entity203 may not come from chickens , but could in fact be from outer space			2
he was head of @entity208 's @entity109 until 2011 , when funding was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post			0
he is now director of the @entity211 at the @entity212			0
the discovery was made by @entity12 cosmonauts @entity214 and @entity216 while polishing the windows of the @entity6 during a spacewalk earlier this week			1
they found the presence of plankton and other microorganisms using high - precision equipment			0
the organisms are not native to @entity225 in @entity151 where the @entity12 modules of the station blasted off from so they could not have been carried into space from launch - although they could have been transferred from @entity41 parts of the station as @entity233 's launches mostly take place near the @entity235			1
' the results of this experiment are absolutely unique , ' said @entity238 , chief of the @entity12 @entity6 orbital mission			2
' we have found traces of sea plankton and microscopic particles on the illuminator [ window ] surface			0
this should be studied further			0
' ' [ @entity248 ] is found on the surface of the ocean			0
it is n’t characteristic to @entity225 [ @entity150 , from where @entity12 launches to the space station take place ]			2
' professor @entity255 , microbiologist at @entity256 , said previous experiments conducted by his team found evidence of diatoms 17 miles ( 27km ) above the @entity2 ’s surface			0
however he said this is the first time they have been detected so far out with the @entity6 more than 200 miles ( 250km ) from the planet			0
he said : ' this is an astonishing development and there is no other explanation other than these organisms came from space in the first place , they could not have blown up from the @entity2			2
' this is the tipping point towards science proving that life is continually coming to @entity2 from space , and that it did so in the first instance			2
' this is an amazing discovery , and there is now overwhelming evidence emerging that organisms on @entity2 came from outer space			1
' assembly of the @entity6 began in 1998 and today construction has effectively been completed			0
aside from housing astronauts to further humanity 's space exploration efforts it also serves as a research laboratory for studies in biology , physics , astronomy and meteorology			0
with regards to the plankton , @entity233 has not yet confirmed whether similar findings have been made in the past , nor what their position is on the latest findings			0
pictured is a @entity302 rocket carrying the crew of @entity304 to the @entity6 on 12 may 2012			0
although it is not likely that plankton were been taken to the @entity6 from this location , it is possible that contamination from @entity41 launches may have spread organisms over the station professor @entity18 is a leading proponent of panspermia , the hypothesis that life exists throughout the universe and is spread by asteroids and comets , in addition to simply drifting through the cosmos			1
@entity73 proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space and travel vast distances			0

controversial academic has claimed life on @entity2 is of extraterrestrial origin
this is based on the finding of plankton on the exterior of the @entity6 this week
previously @entity12 experts had said the organisms must have drifted up to the @entity12 segment of the station from @entity2 on air currents
but professor @entity18 says they likely came from outer space
he says this is proof of the theory of panspermia , that life on @entity2 did not begin on our planet but instead was brought from elsewhere in the cosmos
however a theory for the origin of the plankton has not been *agreed* upon
it may just be a case of contamination from the @entity41 part of the station
