these terrifying images show a group of holiday caravans dangling on a cliff edge above a 200ft drop			1
the mobile homes at the @entity6 , near @entity7 , in the @entity8 of @entity9 , are now being moved from the dangerous positions amid fears that a landslip may cause them to plummet to the beach below			1
in 2011 owners and holidaymakers had to be evacuated after part of the cliff collapsed , causing 34,400 tonnes of rock to spill onto the beach below			1
after a detailed investigation , the caravans were repositioned in a safe location near the cliff edge			1
but now they will be moved back again after a geologist detected ground movement			1
@entity41 co-owner @entity40 said : ' it could be nothing , but we 're not risking people 's lives			0
' since then , warning signs have been put up on site and regular checks are undertaken by a geologist			1
ms @entity40 said a 15mm ( 0.6in ) movement in the ground was detected in the last inspection			0
she said : ' there has been nothing for two and a half years , but we , as a company , feel that we are just not prepared to take any risks and so we are being proactive and shutting the road down			0
dangerous : geologists detected land movement at the site , prompting the owners to take drastic action ' it could be something , it could be nothing			1
it could be two years , it could be 20 years , but we are not prepared to take that risk so we are moving the caravans away from the edge and repositioning			2
' work on removing the caravans and closing down part of the site will begin today			2
ms @entity40 , co-owner of the site for the last 16 years , said about Â£ 1m had been spent on monitoring and equipment			2
with the latest changes , she said about 25 per cent of the leisure site park had been lost			2
aftermath : a terrifying aerial shot of the park in 2011 shows how two caravans had to be moved following the landslip , which saw 34,000 tonnes of rock spill onto the beach below reaction : around 25 per cent of the park has been lost to the ground below since the first incident in 2011 warning signs : the land movement has been threatening the residents in the holiday park in the last three years she said caravan owners would be offered an alternative pitch on site , or a refund for the remaining site fees for this year			1
one caravan owner , who returned from holiday to find the area around her caravan cordoned off , said : ' many of my belongings are in the caravan and now i can not get to them			0
' i do n't know what might happen to them			0
some caravan owners have food in the fridges and they are concerned what will happen to that			2
' the owner , who asked not to be named but lives in @entity116 , said : ' we have not been told what will happened or where we will be put			0
' she said she and other owners would be at the site today hoping to talk to the owners			1
encroaching : since the landslip in 2011 ( pictured ) the land has moved closer to the mobile homes , sparking fears they could fall off coastal erosion is caused by the waves crashing against the rocks over a long period of time			1
sediment is eventually worn away , but sometimes the process is made quicker by wind or extreme weather			0
the @entity137 in @entity138 , west @entity139 , which was built in the 15th century , is facing a similarly uncertain future because the cliff face has fallen away			0
it has already been forced to close its children 's play area because it is dangerously close to the crumbling cliff face , at @entity145 in @entity146 , a stretch of chalk cliff has seen erosion , which would normally take over seven years , happen in just a few months			0
part of the footpath down to one of the best beaches in the world at @entity154 on @entity155 in south @entity156 has also been washed away			0
strong winds have left some of the 270 beach huts at @entity160 on the @entity162 coast vulnerable to being lost to the sea .			0

mobile homes in @entity6 are dangling above a 200ft drop
the site in @entity169 of @entity9 , was evacuated in 2011 after a landslip
owners were evacuated and later moved back away from the edge
however geologists fear more of the land could give way
