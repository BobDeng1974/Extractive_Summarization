union leader @entity0 was no stranger to bitter disputes in his lifetime – and now a rift over his legacy is to reach the @entity5			1
mr @entity0 's daughter with ex-wife @entity7 , @entity8 , has lodged a writ against his partner @entity10 , after being left out of his will			1
ms @entity10 , 52 , is sole executor and trustee of the @entity15 leader 's £ 106,000 estate but mrs @entity8 can not believe her father would have ignored her and his grandchildren in his will , and claims it is riddled with errors			1
mrs @entity8 , 32 , said : ' the will is very different to what i was told			0
this action is a last resort			0
' ms @entity10 's solicitors dismiss the claims and say they will lodge a vehement defence later this week			1
when @entity29 tried to contact ms @entity10 , her daughter said : ' no comment			1
we are still feeling our grief			0
mr @entity0 was 52 when he died in march last year from a massive heart attack			2
he cut a controversial figure – adored by his union members , but often heavily criticised by commuters and politicians for his eagerness to call @entity46 strikes in @entity47 while enjoying a champagne lifestyle			0
the @entity15 leader rose from a modest background to running an organisation with 80,000 members on a six - figure pay deal			0
mr @entity0 was elected to run the @entity15 in 2002 , catapulting him to national fame - and notoriety - as the most radical of a new generation of union leaders			2
@entity0 liked to be seen as a working - class hero , but was paid £ 145,000 a year , enjoyed fine dining in top @entity47 restaurants — memorably once quaffing champagne and running up a £ 650 lunch bill with four of his left - wing brothers — and recently sparked a furore by taking a cruise to @entity66 just before yet another of his strikes			2
@entity0 also came under fire for taking a holiday to @entity71 on the eve of one @entity46 strike			0
but he defended his holiday , saying : ' what do you want me to do ? sit under a tree and read @entity79 every day ? ' he also came in for criticism because of his insistence on living in publicly funded council accommodation in the north of the capital despite his hefty salary			0
however , the outspoken union boss always refused to apologise , saying that he deserved his pay packet , and insisted he had a right to live in the home which he shared with ms @entity10 , an @entity15 employee .			1

@entity0 's partner @entity10 , 50 , and their children left £ 106,000
however , his ex-wife , @entity7 , and daughter @entity96 , left out of will
@entity96 now lodged a writ against ms @entity10 and rift is to reach @entity5
