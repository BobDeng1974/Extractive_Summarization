@entity40 figures show that more than 40 per cent of women and a third of men do not complete the recommended 30 minutes of exercise five times a week			2
this includes a quarter of women and a third of men who are classed as inactive , meaning they do less than 30 minutes exercise on a weekly basis			2
@entity51 academics have claimed that sitting down for too long is as bad for our health as tobacco because it is directly responsible for more deaths worldwide			1
professor @entity5 , said : ‘ globally we ’ve become more and more inactive , in part because our jobs are making us more sedentary			0
‘ we spend too much time sitting down at our computers			1
‘ i do n’t think people understand that physical activity is the miracle cure we ’ve been waiting for			0
‘ this is in terms of helping us manage our weight , reducing our risk of cancers , reducing our risk of heart disease and increasing our mental health and wellbeing			2
