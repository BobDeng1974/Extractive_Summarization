by @entity0 @entity1 – what about her ? would she be better as @entity3 than @entity4 ? come on , team			1
we need positive thinking here			1
she has an economics background , was a chess champion as a child , and worked for the @entity12 before politics			1
that hairdo is slinky enough for a @entity16 advert			1
@entity1 : she has an economics background , was a chess champion as a child , and worked for the @entity12 before politics she attended @entity23 ’s stinker of a speech last week , sat in the front row and managed not to chew her fist			1
she can say ‘ @entity4 would make a great prime minister ’ without promptly howling into a bucket ( the reaction of other shadow @entity31 members )			1
yet she has also conceded that @entity35 has ‘ lost its raison d’etre ’			1
there is a glint of ambition in this lady			1
weak points : inexperience ( b. feb 1979 ) and no discernible sense of humour			1
she was once an ally of @entity45 but has shimmied away from old @entity46			2
the voice is not good			1
it sounds like a blocked peashooter – on radio you might mistake her for @entity53 , played by the late @entity54			1
but engineers may be working on that larynx			2
the tone has risen slightly			2
it is almost high enough now for her to join the tenor line			2
miss @entity1 – whose younger sister @entity61 is on @entity35 ’s @entity62 and is more convincing as an orator – was up in the @entity64 yesterday			1
ms @entity1 conceded that @entity35 has lost its raison d'etre under @entity4 the occasion was questions on @entity68 , which she shadows			1
@entity35 ’s tactic for the next ten months will reportedly be to ‘ toxify ’ government policies			2
we certainly saw that yesterday			2
they moaned about every policy from work capability assessments to personal independence payments to job figures ( what ? employment is at a record high ! )			2
labour mps from @entity84 ( @entity83 ) to @entity86 ( @entity85 ) to @entity87 ‘ all @entity79 are @entity80 ( @entity81 ) bewailed , deplored , lamented , deprecated the state of the nation			2
not all these jeremiads were entirely genuine			0
one of the @entity92 lot , @entity93 , spoke of a ‘ fiasco ’ in this or that sub-pod of the welfare system – it was not handing out as much of our money to the poor as @entity93 wanted			0
@entity103 @entity102 , a minister , said it was absurd to call something a ‘ fiasco ’ when a recent in - depth report had not found anything as bad as that			0
@entity93 , hearing the minister ’s response , laughed in a way that seemed to say ‘ fair point , guv , but i was just saying what the @entity115 told me to say ’			0
it ’s all a game , innit ? @entity118 ( lab , @entity120 ) produced a hand - held silk fan which she waved under her chin to keep cool during all this human misery			0
shades of the bullfight senora			0
on the @entity35 front bench miss @entity1 clenched her hands , examined her purple nail varnish and shook her glistening mane			1
once or twice there came a froggy squawk – she was heckling ministers – but on the whole she was a picture of poise			0
@entity139 , we could work on this one			0
she has more potential than dim - lit @entity141			0
@entity142 and his eye - popping missus are fading			0
@entity144 hotel clerk @entity144 is a non-starter , ditto @entity146			0
miss @entity1 lacks the snorting unpredictability of @entity148 but that may not be a disadvantage			1
she does not have @entity152 ’s eyelashes but she may be more substantial			0
the only problem ? there is no intellectual foundation to her case			0
that is why she is struggling against @entity158			0
@entity158 has a few holes in his record but he has bravely taken on the welfare monolith ( and the @entity163 )			0
miss @entity1 might well rise further in her party but what @entity35 really needs is philosophical change			1
@entity167 ( con , @entity168 ) said that it is now the @entity79 , with their welfare reforms , who have become ‘ the party of labour while the party opposite has become the party of layabouts ’			0
only when the @entity178 realises that egalitarianism itself is shot , kaput , finito , will it stand a chance of long - term recovery .			0

ms @entity1 worked for the @entity12 before going into politics
she was also a chess champion as a child and has quite a few *talents*
but the voice is not good , she sounds like a blocked peashooter
