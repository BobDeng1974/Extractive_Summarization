militants fighting for the @entity1 have released horrific images of an alleged thief having his hand hacked off in its latest warped display of justice			1
the photographs show two masked ' surgeons ' unpacking a briefcase containing meat cleavers , bandages and a chopping board in front of a baying crowd of onlookers			1
a suspect , reportedly convicted of stealing a motorbike after a ' trial ' at an islamic state court , is then frogmarched to a table where his right hand is doused in some form of sterilizing fluid			1
his hand is then held down on a chopping board while a militant lops it off with a cleaver			2
@entity29 justice : two @entity1 ' surgeons ' unpack a briefcase containing meat cleavers , a chopping board and some form of sterilizing fluid before chopping the hand off a thief accused of stealing a motorbike the alleged thief 's right hand is doused in sterilizing fluid to help prevent infection after the amputation barbaric : the thief 's hand in hacked off with a meat cleaver while being held down on a chopping board before the sentencing , the images show crowds of onlookers , including young children , surrounding the table while a fighter appears to read out the charges			1
it is latest in a string of sickening amputations carried out by @entity59 in @entity60 and @entity61 in recent weeks			1
the photographs , like previous one , were shared by @entity64 social media users , who use the @entity68 file sharing website @entity66 to exchange images of the terror group 's latest atrocities			1
the images are high quality and carry the distinctive yellow branding of the group 's @entity75 , suggesting they may be stills from an as - yet unreleased propaganda video			2
it comes just days after photographs taken in the @entity59 stronghold of @entity81 showed in gruesome detail how the terrorists pump their victims full of drugs before using a massive meat cleaver to cut off the hands			2
last month , @entity1 released a document on social media , explaining the rules of @entity1 penal code , which is being brutally enforced across @entity59 - held territory in @entity61 and @entity60			2
entitled ' clarification [ regarding ] the @entity93 ' , the document contains a list of the punishments handed out for crimes committed in the @entity1 , in accordance with the extremist group 's radical interpretation of @entity101 law			0
all punishments are carried out after a ' trial ' at an islamic state court			1
after the sentencing , the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city			0
sick spectacle : a baying crowd of onlookers gather round after being encouraged to watch the amputation iron rule : heavily armed militants monitor the crowds which include children as young a five years old a militant holds what appears to be a charge sheet which is read out before the sentence is carried out men and young boys of all ages are actively encouraged to gather and watch the punishments			1
an @entity1 fighter then reads out the charges found against the victim before the punishment is carried out in public			0
all forms of blasphemy against @entity133 are punished by execution , even if the accuser chooses to repent of their sins			1
likewise , committing murder , spying , apostasy or sodomy is punished by immediate death			0
anyone found guilty of banditry , specifically murder and stealing , is put to death by crucifixion			0
according to @entity1 's reading of @entity101 law , thieves have a hand cut off			0
it is unclear whether the victim can choose which hand is removed			0
@entity1 's penal code also states that anyone found guilty of banditry and caught stealing will have their right hand and their left leg amputated			0
this terrible punishment is done so that every member of the public can identify the victim 's past crime			0
@entity166 is another common punishment carried out under @entity1			0
getting ready : in a previous amputation , the men 's arms are pumped full of drugs and wrapped in tight bandages both to lessen the agony and to reduce the amount of blood flowing from the open wound agony : after having his hand hacked off , the victim is seen receiving medical treatment to ensure the wound does not become infected sick : the victim is seen pinned in a chair by a group of men , one of whom uses a chord to pull his arm taut while two others place a heavy meat cleaver on the top of his wrist , ready to strike			2

*warning* : @entity195
suspect was apparently convicted after a ' trial ' at an @entity133 state court
