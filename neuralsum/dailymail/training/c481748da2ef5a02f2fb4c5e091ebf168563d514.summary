it is the ultimate in portable tvs - a giant screen you can simply roll up and take away with you			2
@entity3 today showed off a working 18inch version - and says a 60 inch screen could go on sale in 2017			1
the @entity8 screen uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport			1
@entity3 has revealed a working roll - up tv that is also transparent when not in use			1
the @entity8 screen uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport			1
@entity20 used high molecular substance - based polyimide film as the backplane of the flexible panel instead of conventional plastic to achieve the maximum curvature radius			1
the polyimide film also helped reduce the thickness of the panel to significantly improve its flexibility			2
as for the transparent oled panel , it boasts 30 percent transmittance , which was achieved by adopting the company ’s transparent pixel design technology			2
the flexible oled panel has a high - definition class resolution of 1200 x 810 with almost 1 million mega-pixels			2
the panel can be rolled up to a radius of 3cm without affecting the function of the display			0
this proves that @entity20 can bring rollable tvs of more than 50 inches to the market in the future , the firm said			0
' @entity20 pioneered the oled tv market and is now leading the next - generation applied oled technology , ' said in - @entity51 , senior vice president and @entity50 at @entity20			0
' we are confident that by 2017 , we will successfully develop an @entity8 flexible and transparent oled panel of more than 60 inches , which will have transmittance of more than 40 percent and a curvature radius of @entity57 , thereby leading the future display market			1

@entity20 has successfully lowered the haze of the panel which is generated by using circuit devices and film components to a level of 2 percent			0
with this breakthrough development , the company has been able to improve greatly the technology level of the transparent display			0
@entity93 has already shown off a prototype flexing screen			0
however , the new mesh technology will allow screens that can be completely folded or rolled into a tight tube without damaging them			2
considering that the transmittance of existing transparent lcd panels is around 10 percent , this new panel offers significantly improved transmittance			0
the @entity105 researchers have developed an entirely new stretchable and transparent electrical conductor , bringing the potential for a fully foldable cell phone or a flat - screen television that can be folded and carried under your arm closer to reality.the gold nanomesh electrodes produced by @entity113 and his research associates @entity115 and @entity116 at @entity105 , along with two colleagues at @entity118 , provide good electrical conductivity as well as transparency and flexibility , the researchers said in a paper in @entity123 .			1

@entity3 have developed working 18inch version - and says 60 inch version will go on sale in 2017
uses special film instead of plastic as backing to allow screen to be rolled into a tube
finished screen with be @entity8 resolution 16 times better than conventional hdtv
firm also showed is also transparent when not in use
