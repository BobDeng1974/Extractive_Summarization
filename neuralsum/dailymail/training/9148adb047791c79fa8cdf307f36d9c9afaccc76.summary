by @entity0 a two - in - one treatment could revolutionise the care of men with advanced prostate cancer			1
patients who undergo surgery as well as drug treatment are twice as likely to still be alive 14 years later as those given medication alone , a study found			0
if further research confirms the effect , the management of late - stage prostate cancer could be ‘ revolutionised ’ , said the researchers			1
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in @entity18 men , affecting 41,000 a year and claiming almost 11,000 lives			1
dual action : prostate cancer patients who undergo surgery as well as drug treatment are twice as likely to still be alive 14 years later as those given medication alone , a study found			1
pictured , prostate cancer cells @entity27 cancer , which has spread to other parts of the body , is normally treated with drugs that mop up the male hormones it needs to grow			1
men live for an average of five years after starting testosterone - blocking drugs			2
in the latest study , @entity18 and @entity37 researchers looked at whether surgery combined with this hormonal therapy is better than the therapy alone			2
half of the 1,400 men studied had their prostate removed before starting testosterone - blocking drugs			1
the other half simply had the drug treatment			0
some 321 men given drugs alone died during the course of the study – twice as many as in the group given surgery and medicine			0
although radical prostatectomy , or prostate removal , is used in earlier stages of the disease , it is not normally carried out once the cancer has spread throughout the body			2
this is because it is thought that the cancer has such a grip that there is little point in trying to contain it			0
there are also concerns about putting patients through surgery , plus prostate removal can cause distressing side effects such as impotence and incontinence			0
however , the latest research , released at the @entity78 ’s annual conference , suggests that the prostate is still fuelling the cancer , even after it has spread elsewhere			2
the conference heard that recent research has focused on developing new drugs			0
however , combining surgery with the standard treatment seems more promising			0
lead author professor @entity86 , of the @entity87 in @entity88 , cautioned that further studies are needed but said the combined treatment could ‘ revolutionise the management of advanced prostate cancer ’			1
@entity93 , of @entity94 , said : ‘ while this is a valid line of inquiry , the evidence is n’t enough to conclude that men with advanced prostate cancer would be better off having a radical prostatectomy			1
‘ however , the findings do indicate that there may be value in conducting a larger clinical trial			0

two - *pronged* treatment could ' revolutionise ' prostate cancer treatment
the cancer is the most common among @entity18 men , *killing* 11,000 a year
