earlier in the day , there appeared to be more police than protesters outside the @entity97 building on @entity8 ' @entity98 , but that calculation soon shifted as night fell and thousands gathered to protest the bill			1
the protest dwindled to a few stalwarts shortly before midnight , when the violence began among a few hundred demonstrators including some who carried signs saying ' socialist dictatorship ' @entity109 , 41 , a mother of two , said that she ' will oppose the bill until the end			0
' she said : ' i 'll keep going to the protests , i do n't give in			2
the bill is not effective yet , the president of the @entity117 must listen to our voices			0

mrs @entity52 and interior minister @entity134 address members of parliament : @entity138 @entity2 is not ready to legalise adoption for same - sex couples , and polls show a country sharply divided on the issue in recent weeks , violent attacks against gay couples have spiked and some legislators have received threats - including one sent a gunpowder - filled envelope			1

the highly controversial new law also makes it legal for gays and lesbians to adopt children , and ban the words ' mother ' and ' father ' from all official documents			0
the new law had been expected pass comfortably in the @entity56 - controlled legislature			2
demonstrators against gay marriage face riot police in @entity8 on sunday : riot police were deployed outside the @entity2 parliament today as lawmakers prepared to vote to make it the 14th country to legalise gay marriage anger : the extraordinary security was put in place to protect the @entity37 following large and at times violent protests by those who oppose legalisation in the months leading up to this afternoon 's vote when president @entity50 initially promised to legalise gay marriage , it was seen as relatively uncontroversial			1
but the issue rejuvenated the country 's conservative movement and brought together the far right , the @entity209 and many @entity2 families from the countryside			1
it had even sparked physical scuffles between right and left wing mps during debates in the @entity37			0
unpopular : the change in law promised by @entity50 ( pictured ) has brought together the far right , the @entity209 and many rural @entity2 the new law states that ' marriage is a union of two people , of different or the same gender ' , and it swaps all references in the civil code to ' mothers and fathers ' to simply ' parents '			1
now it has passed , opposition parties have pledged to challenge the law in @entity2 's highest court , the @entity234			2
and if that fails , they hope public hostility will pressurise mr @entity50 into not signing it into law , just as former president @entity240 backed down from signing an employment law that was voted by parliament in 2006			0
cardinal @entity243 , head of the @entity2 @entity209 , was also leading his own campaign to stop the law , warning followers that gay marriage could lead to legalised incest and polygamy in society			1
he told the @entity253 's @entity252 radio station : ' gay marriage would herald a complete breakdown in society			2
' this could have innumerable consequences			0
afterward they will want to create couples with three or four members			0
and after that , perhaps one day the taboo of incest will fall			0
' legalising gay marriage was one of mr @entity50 's key manifesto pledges , but less than a year later , observers say he has been surprised by the scale of public opposition to the measure			2
there has also a been a sharp rise in the number of homophobic attacks in recent weeks , and several initially peaceful protests have degenerated into violence			0
the law also comes amid a poll showing mr @entity50 has become the most unpopular president in five decades - with a personal approval rating of just 25 per cent			0
no to homophobia : pro-gay marriage protesters at a counter demonstration also held on sunday			0
the new law will also allow gays and lesbians to adopt and ban the words ' mother ' and ' father ' from official documents divisive issue : although president @entity50 's @entity294 is expected to carry this afternoon 's vote by a two - thirds majority , polls show half of the @entity2 population are opposed to gay marriage his first 11 months in office have been blighted by a catalogue of political , economic and personal crises as he finds himself unable to control either the public finances or the wayward antics of first lady @entity306			1
millionaires have been fleeing @entity2 in fear of a proposed 75 per cent tax on all earnings over one million euros			2
the @entity2 equivalent of the @entity313 's @entity312 , called @entity314 , has warned the president that @entity2 risked becoming ' the poor man of @entity317 ' over his ' disastrous ' economic policies			2
and his problems then culminated this month with revelations his own budget minister @entity321 had been hiding up to â‚¬ 20million in a secret bank account to dodge taxes			0
political observer @entity324 said : ' i do n't think he ever thought running @entity2 would be so hard			2
in the face of such fierce opposition to so many of his other policies , he will be a brave man to sign gay marriage into law			2

half of @entity2 voters are against allowing gays to marry , polls show
but the @entity338 are expected to carry the vote with two - thirds majority
vote comes after months of at times violent protests by opponents
