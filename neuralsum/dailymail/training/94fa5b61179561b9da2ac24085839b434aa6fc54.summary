by @entity0 @entity1 were hit with an @entity3 transfer embargo on tuesday night after admitting making undeclared cash payments to players			1
and the troubled @entity7 club are also the subject of a fresh @entity10 investigation – just days after major shareholder @entity11 was accused of breaching fit and proper person regulations			1
currently being sued by former chief executive @entity16 for £ 311,892 , the @entity15 outfit wrote to the @entity18 authorities blaming @entity16 for making ‘ improper ’ payments worth £ 10,500			1
accusation : the club say that the undeclared payments were made by former ceo @entity16 ( above ) nursing debts of £ 1.7million , the club claim they discovered the payments and other irregularities after calling in forensic accountants before immediately declaring them to the @entity3 and @entity10 before they came out in court			1
last night , 50 - per - cent shareholder @entity11 accused @entity16 of placing the club ’s future at peril , telling @entity32 : ‘ this morning we were hit with a transfer embargo based on a self declaration from the club to the @entity3 and @entity10 dated july 31			1
‘ the club has declared its findings into its own investigation into a £ 311,000 claim against the club by the former chief executive @entity16			1
‘ we dispute that claim and in his own loan account he has made £ 10,500 worth of unauthorised cash payments to players			2
‘ in 2010 and 2011 , we believe @entity16 made improper cash bonus payments to players – unknown to any other directors of shareholders			1
‘ i do n’t think there is any hiding that			0
we expected that to come out in a court case now rescheduled for next march and the club felt it had to make a declaration of our findings to the necessary authorities			1
‘ we have that declared in the list of monies he is suing us for			0
it ’s on his own list of cash due			0
‘ the club has now made these declarations to the relevant authorities and the first response has been from the @entity3 , who have informed the chairman @entity72 that the club is under a transfer embargo until the matter is fully investigated			2
‘ the full consequences of @entity16 ’s actions are as yet undetermined			1
those are for the @entity10 to determine			0
‘ but in my opinion there is no one guilty here except @entity16			2
‘ i do take my share of responsibility in this because i spotted this guy ’s shortcomings and tried to have him removed in 2011			0
‘ but @entity16 survived on a casting vote in november 2011			2
’ the latest wrangle marks another chapter in the tempestuous history of a club enmeshed in controversy and financial strife during the @entity94 and @entity95 eras			0
‘ @entity1 has continually had people who live beyond their means , ’ added @entity11			1
‘ mr @entity16 came in here , in my opinion , as @entity99 and got involved in offering inducements to players unknown to any other players or officials			2
fit and proper ? @entity11 ( left ) insists that he hs no case to answer to the @entity10 ‘ but i have a track record of investing and saving clubs and i intend to see @entity1 out of this			1
‘ my position at the moment is that of an unpaid consultant			0
’ @entity11 also faces an @entity10 fit and proper person over claims he failed to act ‘ in the best interests of association football ’ by failing to declare a financial involvement in @entity116 and @entity117			1
the action could now force him to hand his shares in @entity1 over to fans and walk away			2
‘ that complaint surprises me , ’ he continued			0
‘ in 2000 , @entity116 were close to going out of business and i encouraged a family i did business with in the antiques trade to club together and pay the money off as a nice wee investment			0
‘ i was wrong about that because they put in £ 400,000 and now ca n’t give it away			0
‘ all i tried to do was help them to keep the club afloat			0
i have no shares , never have had and never will have any financial interest in @entity116			0
‘ with @entity117 , i sold the club in 2008 for £ 1.7m and the owners still owe me £ 200,000			0
‘ is that a conflict of interest ? the @entity10 must think it is and if it is then i have the choice of either suing @entity117 for the £ 200,000 or disposing of my shares in the holding company of @entity1 which have a trading value at the moment of zero			2
distraction : on the pitch @entity1 had a disappointing start to the season , losing 2 - 1 to @entity150 ‘ it may now be in the best interests of @entity1 for me to stand down from @entity1 5 ( the club ’s parent company ) and try to accelerate a deal @entity156 are trying to push forward for community ownership			1
‘ but i will be astonished if there is any case to answer , because i have no financial interest in @entity116			1
‘ the @entity10 investigated this is 2004 and found no case to answer then			2
i do n’t know what ’s changed now			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity3 said : ‘ the @entity3 has been provided with information by a @entity166 director which indicates a default in relation to @entity170 payments			0
‘ under @entity3 rules , an embargo on the registration of professional players is automatic in these circumstances			0
’ when contacted by the media yesterday , @entity16 declined to comment on the matter because of the ongoing legal case .			1

club admitted payments after accountants discovered irregularities
@entity1 blame former chief executive @entity16
major shareholder @entity11 faces fit and proper person investigation
@entity11 maintains he ' will be astonished if there is any case to answer '
