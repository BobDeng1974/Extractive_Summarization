it 's hard to believe from the shocking footage that mr @entity8 lived to tell the story - let alone walk away without any injuries from the frightening accident where the woman collected a total of three parked cars			1
even more miraculously - the unconscious woman and the little girl , who was in the backseat , also survived the crash without any injuries			2
' i just let go and let my body relax and the car just went straight through me , ' he told @entity42			2
immediately after the crash , mr @entity8 could n't move his right leg and paramedics thought it was broken			1
' i started feeling more and more lucky as the minutes went past and as i got more feeling , ' he said			2
' it just kept getting more moveable and it was amazing - by the time i got to the hospital i was moving			0
' two days later , the keen and extremely lucky surfer was back out in the water doing what he loves			2
@entity55 , and his son @entity56 , were taking a leisurely coastal drive when the vehicle in front of them unexpectedly smashed into the parked cars along the beachfront which was captured on their @entity63 on monday			1
