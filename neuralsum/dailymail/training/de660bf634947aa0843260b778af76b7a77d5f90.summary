by @entity0 last updated at 7:59 pm on 9th february 2012 the former wife of sir @entity3 never authorised former @entity5 editor @entity4 , or anybody else , to listen to her voicemails , she told the inquiry into press standards today			1
chat show host @entity4 has previously told the inquiry he listened to a voicemail message left to @entity13 by sir @entity3 , but refused to say when or where he heard it because he wanted to protect a ' source ' - but did not suggest it had been ms @entity18			1
today ms @entity18 said she had never authorised @entity4 , or anybody , to access or listen to her voicemails , and neither had she ever played a recording to the former editor			1
@entity13 speaking at the @entity23 where she said she had never authorised @entity4 , or anybody , to access or listen to her voicemails ' i could n't quite believe that he would even try to insinuate , a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years , would relish in telling the court if i had played a voicemail message to him , ' she said			1
ms @entity13 told the inquiry that in early 2001 she and sir @entity3 had argued about a trip she was planning to @entity35 , and while she stayed with a friend in @entity37 he left a series of messages on her voicemail			1
she said : ' in the morning , when i woke up , there were many messages , but they were all saved messages which i did not quite understand , because normally they would n't be but i did n't think too much of it			2
' i thought i must have pressed a wrong button			2
' there were about 25 messages all asking for forgiveness of what had happened			2
' one of them said , ' please forgive me ' and sang a little ditty of one of his songs on the voicemail			1
' so that afternoon i went back and all was forgiven			2
' she told the hearing she had never recorded the messages and deleted them straight away			2
@entity4 told the inquiry in december ( pictured ) he would not disclose a source who played him a tape of a message that sir @entity3 left @entity13 but she said she was then called by a former @entity5 employee - who the inquiry heard was not a @entity66 journalist , nor anybody working under the supervision of @entity4 - saying they had heard a recording of the message			1
' i said , ' there 's no way that you could know that unless you have been listening to my messages ' , ' she told the inquiry			2
' she said she threatened to take action if the story was published , and it was n't			2
but in 2006 , in a piece in the @entity84 , @entity4 referred to having listened to the message			1
giving evidence in december , @entity4 told the inquiry he would not disclose a source who played him a tape of a message that sir @entity3 left @entity13			1
ms @entity13 said she was told by detectives from @entity92 that they had evidence that her voicemails had been hacked he said : ' i am not going to discuss where i heard it or who played it to me			1
' i do n't think it 's right			2
in fact the inquiry has already stated to me you do n't expect me to identify sources			2
' @entity104 told him the only person who would be able to lawfully listen to the message was @entity13 or somebody authorised on her behalf			1
he told @entity4 : ' i am perfectly happy to call @entity110 to give evidence as to whether she authorised you to listen to her voicemails			1
' she may say she did in which case you 're not compromising anybody , but if she did n't then we can proceed on the premise that it 's somebody else , ca n't we			2
' asked by counsel for the inquiry @entity122 : ' did you authorise mr @entity4 to access your voicemail ? ' , she replied ' never '			1
he asked : ' did you authorise mr @entity4 to listen to your voicemail ? ' ' never ever , ' she answered			1
ms @entity13 said that before 1999 press coverage of her had been positive mr @entity126 also asked : ' have you ever played to mr @entity4 or authorised him to listen to a recording of this or any other voicemail left on your messaging system ? ' , she replied ' never , never '			1
and asked if she had ever done this to anybody , she answered : ' no '			0
ms @entity13 said she was told by detectives from @entity92 that they had evidence that her voicemails had been hacked			1
she then showed the court a home video which she had compiled of her interactions with paparazzi photographers			0
a man was captured trying to look through a fence surrounding her home saying : ' someone should just bring a hand - drill down and put a hole though			0
' one subtitle in the video read : ' @entity148 becomes a national sport			0
' she told the inquiry she had 64 hours of footage of alleged harassment			0
ms @entity13 said that before 1999 press coverage of her had been positive but it became negative when she met sir @entity3			1
she said : ' the second i met my ex-husband i became a one - legged bitch , and cow , and every awful word you could think of			0
' ms @entity13 told the inquiry that no - win - no - fee agreements needed to ensure that newspapers would pick up entire costs of cases brought by people who have ' absolutely no money '			1
' there are hundreds and hundreds of people out there who have been through horrific situations with papers making up stories and they have no recourse			0
' she said the @entity181 should be a public body sat on by ' respected individual members of the public ' for a year , meaning they could not be bribed , blackmailed , or threatened into making decisions			0
@entity3 and his former wife ms @entity13 in 2007			1
she said sir @entity3 had left a series of 25 messages on her phone after a row also giving evidence , the @entity192 's former head of news told the inquiry he was told to deliberately mislead the @entity197 ' spokesman about the newspaper 's plans to publish @entity201 's diary			1
@entity202 said former editor @entity203 told him to have a ' woolly ' conversation with @entity206 about plans to publish mrs @entity201 's diary so he did not know what the paper was planning			0
mrs @entity201 said she felt ' violated ' when the private journal appeared in the newspaper on september 14 2008			0
mr @entity203 has said he would never have published it if he had realised she was not aware of the paper 's plans , and claimed mr @entity202 told him he had cleared the story with mr @entity206			0
but mr @entity202 said he was deliberately unclear in his conversation with mr @entity206 , on the express instructions of mr @entity203			0
' ( mr @entity203 ) decided to ask me to make a call to mr @entity206 , not make it clear what we had , telling him in general terms , basically make it woolly			0
' he was frightened that if @entity206 knew what we had , he might take action			0
' he also told the inquiry there was a culture of bullying at the @entity192 , of which mr @entity203 was a part			0
mr @entity206 said today he felt vindicated by the evidence			0
' i have always said the @entity192 actively sought to deceive me over the publication of @entity201 's diary			0
' but to hear that it was apparently done at the editor 's direct behest was particularly shocking , if not surprising			0
clearly , mr @entity203 now has some serious questions to answer			0
' the distress this episode caused @entity201 , @entity244 and myself was immense			0
i am glad we are getting to the truth at last			0
