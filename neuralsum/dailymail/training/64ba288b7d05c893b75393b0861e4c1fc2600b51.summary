a federal appeals court today overturned a controversial ruling ordering @entity3 prison officials to provide taxpayer - funded sex - reassignment surgery for an inmate convicted of murder			1
@entity7 , born @entity7 , has already received hormone treatments , psychotherapy and electrolysis while serving a life sentence for strangling to death her wife , @entity13 , in 1990			1
but she has continued to wage a protracted legal battle for the $ 20,000 full genital reconstruction treatment she says is necessary to relieve the mental anguish caused by gender - identity disorder			1
while imprisoned , she has tried to commit suicide twice , as well as attempting to castrate herself			0
although most @entity27 courts agree that prisons must evaluate transgender inmates to determine their medical needs , most have ordered only hormone treatments and psychotherapy , not surgery			2
in january , @entity26 's decision was upheld by a three - judge panel of the 1st @entity27 @entity43			0
however , prison officials appealed and won a rehearing before the full appeals court			1
now , in a 3 - 2 ruling , the full @entity47 found that @entity7 failed to demonstrate officials violated the @entity51 prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by not providing the surgery			1
the court noted that the state 's @entity55 has already provided treatment for 65 - year - old @entity7 's gender - identity disorder , including the female hormones and laser hair removal			1
the court also acknowledged the department 's concerns about protecting @entity7 from sexual assaults if she completes her gender transition			2
arrest : @entity7 ( pictured following her arraignment as @entity7 ) has already received hormone treatments , psychotherapy and electrolysis while serving a life sentence for strangling to death her wife victim : the convict fatally strangled her wife , @entity74 ( pictured ) , with a wire and a rope in 1990 she is currently housed in a male prison but hoped to be transferred to a female prison after the surgery			1
' after carefully considering the community standard of medical care , the adequacy of the provided treatment , and the valid security concerns articulated by the @entity55 , we conclude that the district court erred and that the care provided to @entity7 by the @entity55 does not violate the @entity89 , ' judge @entity80 wrote for the majority			1
however , two judges disagreed with the verdict			0
in a sharply worded dissenting opinion , judge @entity93 suggested that @entity7 would not have had to fight a long battle for constitutionally adequate medical care if she was not seeking ' a treatment that many see as strange or immoral '			2
legal action : in 2011 , @entity7 ( pictured in his police mugshot ) said the surgery is a medical necessity ' prejudice and fear of the unfamiliar have undoubtedly played a role in this matter 's protraction , ' @entity93 wrote			2
the @entity55 declined to comment immediately			0
the case sparked a heated debate in @entity3 , where @entity7 's lawsuit became fodder for radio talk shows and state lawmakers who say the state should not be forced to pay for or provide a murderer 's sex - reassignment surgery			1
in his ruling ordering the surgery , @entity27 district court judge @entity26 found that it is the ' only adequate treatment ' for @entity7			1
in 2011 , the inmate told @entity122 that the surgery is a medical necessity			0
' everybody has the right to have their health care needs met , whether they are in prison or out on the streets , ' @entity7 said			0
' people in the prisons who have bad hearts , hips or knees have surgery to repair those things			0
my medical needs are no less important or more important than the person in the cell next to me			0
' @entity7 's lawyer , @entity144 , said he was disappointed in the ruling , but declined further comment because he had not yet read the full 117 - page ruling			2
@entity148 , director of the @entity149 of the @entity151 - based legal group @entity152 , said she was appalled by the ruling			0
' if somebody had a heart condition , if somebody had liver disease , if somebody had diabetes ... under the constitutional principles applied to all people who are incarcerated , that person would be entitled to essential medical care , ' @entity154 said			0
' it really is hard to understand this decision as anything other than transgender exceptionalism			0

@entity7 , born @entity7 , jailed for life for murdering wife in 1990
