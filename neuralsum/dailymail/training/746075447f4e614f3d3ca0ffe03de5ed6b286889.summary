click here for the @entity1 between the spy drone that was said to have flown over the @entity5 training camp last week and the goal - line cameras used here on sunday night , @entity2 would probably argue that technology has done their @entity9 bid no favours			1
they should perhaps blame themselves , too , for an over-physical approach that ultimately proved their undoing , @entity17 becoming embroiled in a 45 - minute wrestling match with @entity19 and getting himself sent off			1
his second yellow card , earned for a stupid challenge on the towering @entity24 midfielder inside the area , was the decisive moment of the match			0
there have been some controversial penalties in this tournament already but this was not one of them , @entity34 stepping up to secure the first - half advantage @entity36 deserved			1
but the circumstances surrounding what appeared to be @entity34 ’s second — it was given as an own goal three minutes after the break — could be a source of argument long after this encounter concluded			2
booked : @entity71 , @entity19 , @entity72			1
@entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity60 4 ; @entity78 6 , @entity79 5 ( @entity80 46 6 ) , @entity81 6 , @entity82 6 ; @entity83 5 ( @entity84 58 6 ) , @entity85 6 , @entity17 4 , @entity86 6 ; @entity87 5 ( @entity88 46 6 ) 6 , costly 5			1
booked : @entity17 , @entity88			2
sent off : @entity17 ( second yellow )			2
referee : @entity91 ( @entity92 ) 6			0
man of the match : @entity76			0
it was some half - volley that @entity34 produced from a marvellous diagonal pass by @entity72			2
but only after the ball bounced off a post , across the face of goal and struck @entity60 , the @entity2 goalkeeper , did it seemingly cross the goal - line			1
the problem was what appeared on the big screen			0
the declaration that it was ‘ no goal ’ sparked wild celebrations among the 10 men of @entity2 but was clearly a judgment made on the position of the ball before it reached @entity60			1
a second judgment soon followed			0
‘ goal , ’ the screen declared , @entity92 referee @entity115 confirming the strike he had actually awarded the moment it was scored			2
presumably he had received a buzz from his watch			0
it was a @entity9 first			0
the trouble was , pictures remained inconclusive to the naked eye and the more they were shown on the screen , the more confused everyone became			0
@entity127 was baffled and expressed his sympathy to @entity129 , the coach of @entity2			2
at least there was no disputing who scored @entity36 ’s third goal ; a blistering effort from @entity34 in the 72nd minute			1
thump : @entity34 made it 3 - 0 , but not a hat - trick , with a fine effort into the roof of the net pride : the big forward was in fine form on sunday night in @entity92 patience : @entity34 put @entity36 in front , converting a penalty just before half time no chance : the goalkeeper is sent the wrong way by the @entity151 striker sloppy : @entity17 was sent off for a second bookable offence after needlessly bringing down @entity19 a match lacking national anthems — presumably because of some kind of technical hitch — did not lack atmosphere , the @entity158 buzzing with excitement thanks to the @entity5 fans			1
what everyone anticipated , of course , was a physical contest from @entity2 but @entity36 collected the first booking after @entity71 ’s naughty challenge on @entity83			1
@entity36 looked strong , @entity19 giving them an imposing presence in midfield			1
@entity170 sees much of himself in the former @entity172 midfielder , modestly suggesting the 21 - year - old has been blessed with superior skill			2
@entity19 certainly made his presence felt in an aerial challenge with @entity17 , the @entity2 midfielder coming off distinctly second best			1
when a free - kick from @entity179 was diverted into the path of @entity75 , his half - volley was pushed against the bar by @entity60			1
the crossbar would then deny @entity77 after the @entity183 forward met a cross from @entity71 with a decent header			0
on - field battle : the duo clashed earlier in the game , resulting in two yellow cards @entity190 : after being stamped on , @entity19 lashed out at @entity191 , kicking him into the air the only concern , at least for @entity127 , was an apparent desire to meet fire with fire			1
@entity19 and @entity17 were having a real battle , the @entity198 midfielder appearing to stamp on @entity19 with the @entity5 then lashing out — @entity200 - style — in response			1
both were booked when at least one red card could have been issued for a clash that sparked something of a melee between the two sides			0
@entity5 opportunities kept coming , with @entity77 — who really excites their fans — consistently threatening			0
the breakthrough came when @entity17 crashed into the back of @entity19 and gave the @entity92 referee no option but to award the spot - kick and banish the @entity216			1
if @entity127 is pleased with the result , he will be less impressed that his team picked up three bookings , given he is a stickler for discipline			0
he is also sure to note that @entity19 was a little fortunate not to get sent off			2
even so , he will be encouraged by the display against some intimidation			0
and @entity224 will be relieved too			0
after securing three points , the @entity226 chairman will be delighted that the ‘ mass suicides ’ across the @entity229 that he predicted are now unlikely to occur			0
careful : @entity70 stands up @entity83 on the flank during the @entity9 game			0
