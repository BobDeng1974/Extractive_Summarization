please be aware that the staff at @entity4 are armed and may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students			1
' the plan is coming into action after a vote in january , and follows ' a comprehensive evaluation of @entity32 's safety , security and emergency response politics ' after ' the unfortunate and tragic situations that occurred in multiple @entity37 schools over the last several years , ' a release obtained by the @entity40 states			0
any armed teacher will have to have a handgun licence , as well as pass an interview , psychological exam and a firearms and emergency response training course			2
' i think if a tragedy does occur , lives can be saved by guns being in the right hands , and i think the teachers here might be able to stop something like that and life can be saved , ' parent @entity47 told @entity58			0
aftermath : @entity60 , where staff will now carry guns in the wake of the @entity65 tragedy the four schools in the district where guns will now be in the hands of teachers are @entity60 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
@entity4 is the latest in a string of districts to arm its teachers or increase security in schools in the wake of the @entity65 tragedy in 2012			1

although just seven of these have put it into action to date - by sending their staff to train as ' marshals ' - the @entity117 reports			0
others have opted to instead increase school police presence or rely on the local authorities			0
