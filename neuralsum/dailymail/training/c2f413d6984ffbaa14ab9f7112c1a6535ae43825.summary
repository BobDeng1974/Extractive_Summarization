by @entity0 nature lovers , gardeners and landowners have been warned against a toxic weed , nicknamed ' @entity5 ' , which can burn and blister the skin of anyone who touches it			1
giant hogweed , which can reach 23ft high , originates from @entity10 and @entity11 and was shipped into the @entity12 by @entity14 plant hunters in the 19th century			1
however , the @entity16 - like plant spread out of gardens and private collections and across the countryside , while its sap can burn and blister the skin of anyone who touches it			1
warning : nature lovers , gardeners and landowners have been warned against toxic giant hogweed , the sap of which can cause skin to blister hastily - introduced rules mean it is now illegal to plant hogweed in the wild - but nature experts say the ruling has come too late			1
and because its stems are hollow , children playing in the countryside this summer are at risk if they pick them up to use as pretend telescopes or peashooters			0
giant hogweed has taken hold in many areas of the @entity12 and the latest to be hit is the @entity45 in @entity46 , where landowners are joining forces with the @entity46 and @entity49 to stop it spreading further			1
' we have fought against the giant hogweed since 2010 but more money is urgently required if we are to continue the battle effectively this year , ' said @entity53 , the trust 's @entity54 non-native plants officer			1
the giant hogweed thrives on moist ground and once a river bank has become dominated by it , the plant blots out the sunlight and kills off rivals			1
origins : giant hogweed , which can reach 23ft high , originates from @entity10 and @entity11 and was shipped into the @entity12 by @entity14 plant hunters in the 19th century eventually it becomes so dominant that it is virtually impossible to manage			1
for the past few years the @entity67 has funded treatment by professional contractors using approved herbicide along the banks of the @entity72			0
however , because of cutbacks to public funding , other sources of money now need to be foundto head off the risk of the hogweed invading waterside gardens			0
' each giant hogweed plant is capable of producing 50,000 seeds so it is vitally important the control work continues , ' said ms @entity53			1
' if we stop now and allow the hogweed plants to produce seed , we could be back at square one in no time at all			2
' the @entity88 advises gardeners wanting to destroy invasive clumps of giant hogweed to first consider whether this can be done using non-chemical means such as digging out or suppressing with mulch , before using weedkillers			0
pull up young hogweeds by hand when the soil is moist - do this in may when the giant hogweed has reached a reasonable height , but before it has produced its flowering spike			0
for larger plants it might be necessary to loosen the roots with a fork first			2
never let hogweed set seed , but allow the flower spike to form and then remove it before the flowers fade			0
at this stage , the plant is less likely to survive trimming than earlier in the year			2
protect yourself from any skin contact with the sap , especially your face , when cutting stems , and carry out control measures in overcast weather avoiding sunny periods			1
wash off any sap as soon as possible			2
chemicals in the sap can cause photodermatitis or photosensitivity , where the skin becomes very sensitive to sunlight and may suffer blistering , pigmentation and long - lasting scars			1
where these methods are not feasible , chemical controls may need to be used choose a weedkiller that is appropriate for purpose by reading the label carefully before buying or using			0
particular care must be taken when using residual weedkillers			0
when controlling giant hogweed always wear gloves , cover your arms and legs , and ideally wear a face mask when working on or near it			0
cut plant debris , contaminated clothing and tools are potentially hazardous too			2
wash any skin that comes in contact with the plant immediately			1
where there are many plants , try applying a tough weedkiller containing glyphosate			2
ideally , spray the foliage early in the summer and the plants should be re-treated in august or september , if necessary			0
alternatively , cut back flowering plants and then spray any young foliage that re-grows in august and september			0
mature plants are likely to need more than one treatment to kill them .			0

@entity164 can reach 23ft high and originates from @entity10 and @entity11
plant has spread across the country , *favouring* *wet* areas like *riverbeds*
the plant 's sap can burn and blister the skin of those who touch it
