extra exposure to the sun could potentially reduce the risks of developing some forms of cancer by up to 50 per cent , according to experts			1
previous studies by professor @entity7 found those who had lived in areas with higher levels of uv rays had a 30 to 40 per cent lower chance of pancreatic cancer than those who had lived in areas with lower ambient uv rays			2
the professor from the @entity18 in @entity19 is currently recruiting 25,000 @entity20 over 60 to participate in a study to examine if vitamin d can reduce the risks of ovarian , oesophageal and pancreatic cancers			1
@entity28 exposure could potentially reduce the risks of ovarian , oesophageal and pancreatic cancers professor @entity31 said it is very important to get some sun exposure , especially those who do n't have enough time to go outside			1
not enough sunlight may cause children to developing rickets , which is a bone disease that affects infants and youths , and osteomalacia or soft bones in adults			2
professor @entity31 is currently recruiting 25,000 @entity20 over 60 to participate in a vitamin d study the @entity47 found that one in every four @entity20 adults had a vitamin d deficiency in 2011 - 12			1
' even if it 's only for 2 - 3 minutes each day , it will be enough to get that source of vitamin d , ' professor @entity31 said			2
' exposing more skin in a short period of time is better than less skin in the long run			0
go outside and lift your shirt or pants up â€“ show your tummy and legs			0
' vitamin d deficiency is more likely in naturally dark - skinned people , those who cover up for religious or cultural reasons and the elderly			0
people who are always indoors due to work , infants of vitamin d deficient mothers and patients with osteoporosis are also high risk			0
the @entity76 reports that people should go outside without any protection around midday for 30 minutes a day to get enough vitamin d during winter			0
professor @entity31 will coordinate a d - health trial , which will observe two study groups of participants , randomly taking either the vitamin d tablet or a placebo tablet ( no active ingredients ) on the first day of each month for up to 5 years and they will not know which tablet they are taking during this study			1
the study will observe whether taking a vitamin d tablet changes the risk of a person being diagnosed with health conditions such as cancer , heart disease or infections			0
not enough uv rays may cause children to develop rickets and ostemomalacia in adults her previous studies revealed hundreds of participants , linked high uv exposure to a 30 per cent reduced risk of ovarian cancer and a 40 per cent reduced risk of oesophageal cancers			1
sun exposure was beneficial to those with more sun - sensitive fair skin , with 47 per cent reduced risk of pancreatic cancer , compared to those with a tan			0
professor @entity31 said there is still insufficient evidence to suggest it is possible to achieve the full cancer - fighting advantage of @entity122 pill supplements , or whether the apparent health benefits relied on the sun. ' we certainly are not hand on heart saying this is definitely true , in these types of epidemiological studies we are always very cautious about saying something is casual , but we do see an association between uv exposure and some cancers , ' she said			1
' we have tried to adjust for other factors that might influence their risk of cancer and the association remained			0
