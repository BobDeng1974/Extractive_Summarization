by @entity1 reporter published : 08:46 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 13:29 est , 27 september 2013 original : @entity3 was one of the original " @entity9 " girls who supported the war effort by filling tens of thousands of jobs because able - bodied men had joined the fighting overseas			1
when @entity11 entered an aircraft assembly factory during @entity13 , she never imagined that she would still be working as a riveter more than 70 years later			1
the 93 - year - old first joined the workforce as a single mom in 1942 , piecing together planes at @entity19 in @entity20 to support the war effort			1
but rather than dip out of work or take a traditionally ' female ' job at the war 's end like other ' @entity9 ' women , @entity3 returned to the plane assembly line where she felt most productive			2
she worked at the @entity29 in @entity30 for 14 years , before moving to her current job at @entity33 's c - 17 plant , the state 's last large military aircraft production line			1
' i 'm a working person , i guess			2
i like to be around people that work , ' she told @entity40			2
' i like to get up , get out of the house , get something accomplished during the day			2
' she said retiring at the standard age was never an option , because she had to care for her son and mother , and she had ' endless energy '			2
although when @entity49 finishes off its last contract for the cargo planes , she will probably have to call it a day			1
while the @entity33 resident admits that riveting is not an occupation in which you 'd expect to find an elderly woman , the work helps to keep her on her toes			1
she is out of bed every morning at 4am and gets a coffee and newspaper , before starting work by 6am			2
she parks as far away from the plant as possible so she can walk over - her morning exercise			1
' got ta keep moving ! ' she chirps			2
the great grandmother 's dedication and longevity have made her a local legend , with her boss admitting he sometimes turns to her for professional advice			1
' she 's an inspiration , ' colleague @entity72 , a structural mechanic , said			0
' she just enjoys working and enjoys life			0
' @entity9 : @entity11 , 93 , inserts rivets into the wing sections of c - 17 cargo planes at a @entity80 @entity49 plant - a job she 's done since 1942			1
expert : @entity3 works on the @entity86 @entity85 @entity84 cargo aircraft legendary : @entity3 , a great grandmother , has become a legend among her co-workers on the state 's last large military aircraft production line strong : @entity3 's colleagues are impressed at her stamina @entity3 was recently honored when @entity33 opened @entity96 next to the site of the former @entity99 plant , where women worked during @entity13 , according to @entity101			1
it celebrates not only the @entity9 era , but the later women 's empowerment movement propelled by the slogan attached to the iconic @entity108 wartime poster , ' @entity109 ! ' @entity3 is one of the original women who took up thousands of factory jobs vacated by men sent to fight overseas			1
in its heyday , the c - 17 plant was fully staffed with a parking lot so big that workers put flags on their cars to find them in the sea of vehicles , @entity3 told @entity101			1
@entity33 's aerospace industry has shrunk markedly since the war , causing production to dwindle and many jobs becoming more mechanized			0
the fact that @entity3 kept her job well beyond retirement age when others were losing theirs is testament to her skill and legendary status			0
glamorous : when @entity3 joined a small group of women at @entity137 in @entity20 during @entity13 , the bosses threatened to give demerits to the men who stood around trying to talk to her friendly : @entity3 , center , with her colleagues at one of several factories she worked at @entity148 's poster , created for @entity149 , has become one of the most iconic images of @entity13 however @entity3 overcame numerous hurdles on the way to fame			1
@entity101 reported @entity3 was newly single with a young son when she joined the war effort with her two sisters			0
' during those days , we could hardly find an apartment that would let you rent with kids			0
my goodness , they 're going to go to war someday and they ca n't even live in an apartment , ' she said			0
in her first job , she earned just 65 cents an hour - her son 's childcare cost $ 20 a month			0
her male colleagues resented her at first , but eventually accepted that women could do the same job just as well - if not better			0
@entity3 's grandson , @entity176 , said his grandmother made history			0
' you 've saved @entity86 lives and you 've been saving @entity86 lives your whole life , ' @entity176 said he told @entity3			0
' it 's a powerful story , a positive story , and one hell of a tribute to the female work force			0
' while @entity3 expects she will retire soon , she admits her energy is boundless			1
' when i go to heaven , ' she laughed			0
' i hope @entity191 keeps me busy ! '			0
