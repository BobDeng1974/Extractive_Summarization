this is the incredible moment a diver balances a shark on the palm of his hand on the bottom of the ocean floor			1
the diver - known only as @entity8 - dove 45 - feet in the @entity9 to meet with a pack of 15 @entity12 sharks			1
he then chose a shark and sent it to sleep by performing a gentle nose rub			1
after hypnotising the shark , he then managed to balance one in the palm of his hand			1
conservationists - such as the shark hypnotist shown in these pictures - highlight the unusual side to these vulnerable creatures			1
mr @entity34 said : ' my wife and i were both surprised at how gently and calmly the sharks behaved			0
' right from the beginning , our shark whisperer @entity8 was able to start hypnotizing one of the sharks			1
' it became completely docile in his hands			0
once he had calmed the shark , he gently grasped its dorsal fin and turned the shark in the water so that it was parallel to us			0
' moving slowly to avoid disrupting the shark 's trance , @entity8 brought its body towards us until the shark was sitting directly in our laps			0
my wife and i lightly touched the shark 's body and its fins , the skin feeling somewhat like a rubbery , fine - grain sandpaper			2
' brave : @entity35 business student @entity34 , 31 , took the pictures in the @entity9			2
@entity8 can be seen with the sharks following his dive calm : @entity8 gently touches this shark as he begins to hypnotise it gentle : the sharks become completely docile in his hands of @entity8 the shark diver was able to hypnotise the shark by inducing what scientists call ' tonic immobility ' or ' apparent death ' as it is otherwise known			1
tonic immobility is a state of temporary paralysis caused by rubbing the nose of the shark			2
the effect lasts for around 15 minutes and the shark is not harmed by being gently induced into this state			2
it 's not known exactly why sharks respond to a nose rub in this way - but marine experts believe this could be a defence mechanism			1

' similarly , others have mentioned that we must have been quite brave to dive with sharks so close , and that it looked quite dangerous			0
' @entity133 sharks are not known to attack humans though			0
' being there and seeing these animals move , i never felt threatened			0
' the sharks were not interested in us at all , and seemed almost friendly			0
but it 's good to keep in mind that these are wild animals			0
