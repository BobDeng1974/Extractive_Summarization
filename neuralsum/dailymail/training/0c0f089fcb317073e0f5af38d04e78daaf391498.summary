@entity146 and @entity147 : another theory : @entity2 scientists have studied this case and say the phenomenon is down to the fact a gene linked with twinning occurs at a much higher rate in the village than it does elsewhere ten - year - old @entity158 and @entity157 : this concentration within the town , which was settled by a small group of @entity144 - speaking immigrants , has been compounded by decades of intermarriage 50 years of twins : this is the grave of the first couple to have twins in @entity3 proud heritage : even murals of twins adorn walls across the town ' @entity173 ' : even upon entering the town , visitors are reminded of its famous nickname the locals recalled him by different names , @entity114 explained , but each interviewee had the same reaction when shown a picture of @entity60 : ' that 's him			1
