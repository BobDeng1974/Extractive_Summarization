@entity0 is expected to make a ' last - ditch ' bid to remain in the @entity2 as officials gather today to discuss his expulsion from the sport			1
the disgraced @entity7 owner is set launch a stiff legal challenge to @entity2 commissioner @entity10 's vow to force him to sell the team			1
mr @entity10 has already banned @entity0 from the @entity2 for life and imposed a maximum $ 2.5million fine in response to alleged racist remarks about black players			2
now a source tells the @entity30 that @entity0 has instructed his long - time attorney @entity19 to fight the @entity2 's moves to excise him from the sport			1
mr @entity19 previously successfully defended @entity33 against an lawsuit claiming racial discrimination brought by the @entity7 ' general manager @entity36 in 2009			2
the unnamed source told @entity30 reporters @entity39 and @entity40 : ' i think it will be one last - ditch effort for both billionaire @entity0 and millionaire @entity19			0
' @entity45 action : @entity2 commissioner @entity10 speaks during a press conference in @entity47 where he announced that the @entity2 is banning @entity33 from the sport for life over the alleged racist remarks the move comes ahead of a first meeting of the advisory finance committee of the @entity2 board today , which will review the next steps in forcing @entity0 to sell the @entity7			1
two of the league 's 29 other team owners , including the governing board 's chairman , have already said they expected to reach the three - quarters majority vote needed to expel @entity0 fully , a move unprecedented in @entity2 history			1
according to @entity2 bylaws , mr @entity10 must present @entity0 with a written copy of any allegations within three days , and @entity0 would have five days to answer			0
a special hearing of the @entity68 , consisting of all the owners , would then be held on a date no more than 10 days after @entity0 's reply			0
but it now seems that @entity0 , who bought the @entity7 in 1981 for $ 13 million when the team was based in @entity74 , will not go without a fight			2
if owners vote against him , is seems likely that he would seek a temporary restraining order which could lead to an injunction that would keep the case in court for years			1
glamorous : the taped conversation is said to have recorded remarks made by @entity0 to @entity83 , a model of mixed @entity86 and @entity87 heritage with whom he has often been seen @entity0 was stripped of his seat on the board as part of the lifetime ban for the ' deeply offensive and harmful ' racial views he was said to have expressed in audio recordings released over the weekend			0

' the female friend was said to be @entity83 , a 31 - year - old model of mixed @entity86 and @entity87 heritage who has often been seen by @entity0 's side			0
she has denied being the source of the recording			0

news of the recordings drew outrage from players , fans , politicians - including president @entity118 - and sponsors , several of whom said they were cutting ties with the team , even after the @entity2 moved to remove @entity33			0
the ban imposed on tuesday prohibits @entity0 from any ties with the @entity7 organisation or the league as a whole and bars him from ever again attending @entity2 games or practices			1
@entity0 , the longest - tenured of the @entity2 's 30 owners , also was excluded from any team business or player personnel decisions and was fined $ 2.5 million , the league 's maximum monetary penalty			1
asked whether @entity0 , 80 , could end up an absentee owner if the governing board declined to force a team sale , mr @entity10 said : ' i fully expect to get the support i need from the other @entity2 owners to remove him			2
