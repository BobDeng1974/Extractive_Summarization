a @entity1 - backed organization is facing a bizarre land use battle over its plans to turn a patch of secluded in woods near the presidential retreat @entity7 into a drug rehab center			1
lawyers hired by drug rehab network @entity10 have argued that @entity12 , a property in @entity14 , @entity15 , has historic significance because president @entity17 once caught a fish at the site			1
opponents view the proposed designation as a trick to circumvent current zoning laws for the 40 - acre plot of land and create a drug rehabilitation program that some call dangerous			1
@entity10 , a @entity1 - affiliated drug rehab network , is trying to prove that a patch of land near @entity7 is historic enough so that they can build a center for twelve patients a scientology - back real estate company bought @entity12 for $ 4.85million in 2013 , and has been trying to change its land designation so that it can build a center that uses saunas and vitamin therapy for addicts @entity10 , which uses sauna sessions and the teachings of @entity1 founder @entity42 , has been sued in the past for wrongful deaths			1
the group 's treatment program claims that megadoses of the vitamin niacin and spending five hours a day in a sauna for a month eliminates addiction cravings that are stored in the body 's fat cells			2
treatments at the center can cost more than $ 30,000 per month and typically last for as long as six months			2
@entity10 officials , who run more than 120 centers around the world , deny that the program tries to convert addicts to @entity1 , though the group prominently features a quote from @entity42 on its website			1
the organization says that is focused on a secular approach to helping people overcome addiction			0
its @entity15 center would house 12 patients , with eight staff living there and eight living off - site			1
however , the current zoning laws for @entity12 , which includes a collection of stone cottages , classify it for resource conservation and do not permit any medical purpose for the site , according to the @entity80			1
though @entity82 says that it is non-religious and does not try to convert people to @entity1 , its website features the religion 's founder @entity42 ( pictured ) prominently placing the property on the county register of historic places would allow @entity90 to conduct its program			1
the rehabilitation program was founded in 1966 and is based on the teachings of @entity1 's founder @entity42			0
@entity90 claims it is a non-religious , non-profit , non-medical rehabilitation program with patients around the world			2
its methods include spending up to five hours a day in a sauna for 30 days straight and mega doses of the vitamin @entity103			2
the hypothesis underlying the program is that drugs and their metabolites are stored in the body 's fatty tissues for years , causing the addict 's cravings when partially released later on			0
but these can be flushed out through a regimen comprising elements such as exercise , sauna and intake of high doses of vitamins , according to the facility 's methods			0
this hypothesis does not enjoy mainstream acceptance , and researchers and practitioners tend to discount @entity90 due to its connection with @entity1			2
no independent study that has not been funded by the center exist to confirm the supposed efficacy of its treatment , which has repeatedly been cited as curing 75 per cent of addicts			2
since its establishment , it has faced considerable controversy over the safety and effectiveness of its rehabilitation methods and the organization 's links to the @entity1			0
fees can sometimes reach more than $ 30,000 per month and centers bring in millions of dollars a year from patients			2
an aide of @entity17 bought the property in the late 1920s and the president went on fishing trips there , the @entity144 reported			1
@entity10 hired a consultant whose history of @entity12 said that @entity17 ' reeled in a fine one - and - one - half pound trout ' during a visit			1
' no president was born or died there			0
no epic battles were won or lost , no proclamations penned , no foreign dignitaries lodged and feted , ' local drug counselor @entity158 wrote in opposition to the historic designation			0
she said that the area merits a roadside plaque at most			0
president @entity164 and other @entity166 elites also fished at @entity12 during his time in office			1
@entity14 's @entity169 ruled that the site is eligible to be voted onto the register because of its early 20th century architecture			1
@entity173 , a real estate company tied to @entity1 , bought the land in 2013 for $ 4.85million from a government official who had long been trying to sell it			1
@entity90 has been working on building its center since			1
county councilors delayed voting on the measure two weeks ago so they could have more time to review the proposal and plan to grant or deny approval on tuesday			0
beyond questions of history , opponents to the rehab center have cited safety concerns about the mysterious organization being so close to @entity7 and @entity10 's alleged checkered past			0
celebrity @entity190 such as @entity192 and @entity193 have repeated @entity90 's message about how it saves 75 per cent of addicts			1
@entity12 was first built and developed by an aide of president @entity17 ( right ) in the late 1920s			1

the group has already approached the @entity15 @entity236 and @entity237 about acquiring a license for its facility but has not filed an application			0
its website says it currently runs 16 centers in the @entity243 , though the only one on the @entity244 is in @entity245			0
