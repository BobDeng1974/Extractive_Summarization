by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 5 february 2013 @entity1 knew she was overweight and struggled to walk long distances , but it was a devastating incident on a packed bus that made her realise she had to take drastic action			1
the 45 - year - old from @entity7 , was travelling to work one cold february morning in 2010 when a passenger pointed out the spare seat next to her to an elderly gentleman			1
' he said at the top of his voice : " i ca n't sit next to that ! there 's not enough room			2
" i was absolutely devastated , ' she says			2
she has now slimmed down to 10st 1lb ( r ) in tears , miss @entity1 got off at the next stop - almost hyperventilating - and struggled into work on foot			1
but the size 30 worker was so unfit that the 15 minute walk took her an hour			2
' i arrived at work hot , flushed and sweating for half an hour afterwards			2
i realised i had to do something , ' she said			1
@entity1 is now a svelte size 10 miss @entity1 weighed 20st 3lb with a body mass index of 47.1 - which placed her in the morbidly obese category			1
but it was n't until that moment that she could face up to the truth			2
' i was in such a bad way and was just existing , not living , ' she said			2
@entity1 had always been bigger than her friends as a child but her eating went out of control after a family tragedy			1
' when i was 19 i lost my father			1
i was so close him			2
i did n't realise then but i started eating for comfort			1
' she became a yo - yo dieter , losing a few stone only to put it back on - and more			2
her eating habits became even worse after her mother became seriously ill in 2004			1
@entity1 struggled to juggle work with caring with her mother at evenings and weekends			1
' i was getting out less and less and eating all the wrong foods , like sausage rolls and pastries , crisps , chocolate and biscuits , plus a fat - laden ready meal or takeaway for dinner , ' she said			2
' if i did go out in the evening , i 'd down about five or six pints of real ale			0
' by 2006 , @entity1 was put on anti-depressants and took a career break to look after her mother full time during her final months			1
she returned to work but by now was a size 30			0
she said : ' i was so unfit i could n't walk anywhere without getting out of breath but until the incident on the bus , i did n't have the impetus to do anything about it			1
' in march 2010 she joined a local slimming club and within five weeks lost her first stone			1
she went to three exercise classes a week , kept a food diary and ate a little and often			1
' everything felt so much easier after i had lost about 3st			0
my depression lifted , i felt happy for the first time in ages and was taken off medication , ' she said			0
after two years she had lost 9st and had slimmed down to a healthy size 12			0
today she weighs 10st 1lb , having lost half her body weight , and is a healthy size 10			0
she said : ' i still count my calories as it 's second nature now			0
i also do 10 minutes of toning a day , with exercises like squats and lunges			0
' her success has earned her the title of @entity94 's @entity93 2013			0
she received her award - along with Â£ 1,000 - from @entity94 at a glittering @entity96 ceremony			0
she said : ' losing weight has had such a positive effect on my life			0
i feel like a totally different woman now			0
last year i walked the @entity101 ; now i plan to run it			0
' i want to do the 18 - mile @entity102 this year and would love to do a marathon			0
' @entity1 is much happier with her new size			1
she was taken off anti-depressants after losing her first 3 stone she added : ' my life has changed completely and i know i will never go back to the way it used to be			0
