@entity0 : he was right about the expansion of the universe @entity0 has been proved correct in his view of how the universe is expanding , according to a scientific study released today			1
the new test of @entity0 's view of the universe has proved him right with ‘ incredible accuracy ’ and is helping scientists to understand the mysterious acceleration of the universe			1
a team of cosmologists have announced at the @entity15 being held at the @entity16 the most accurate measurement ever made from when the expansion of the universe began to accelerate			0
it means that the phenomenon can be explained using just @entity0 's general theory of relativity and the cosmological constant - the simplest theoretical explanation for the acceleration of the universe			1
the results will be used to understand what is causing the acceleration and why , and will shed new light on dark energy - the name adopted for the fundamental agent driving the acceleration about which little is known			1
the cosmologists from the @entity35 and the @entity36 have examined the period between five and six billion years ago when the universe was almost half its present age and made measurements of extraordinary accuracy - within 1.7 per cent			1
the findings support @entity0 's general theory of relativity which predicts how fast galaxies , separated by large distances , should be moving toward one another and at what rate the structure of the universe should be growing			1
the conclusions are consistent with the concordance model of a universe that bloomed from the big bang 13.7billion years ago			1
team member dr @entity55 said : ‘ the results are the best measurement of an intergalactic distance ever made , which means cosmologists are closer than ever to understanding why the universe 's expansion is accelerating			2
‘ one of the great things about @entity0 's general theory of relativity is that it is testable			1
our results support the theory and are fully consistent with the notion that constant vacuum energy - empty space creating a repulsive force - is driving the acceleration of the universe			2
‘ these are profound statements that describe the physics of our universe at the most fundamental level			0
‘ critically , the results find no evidence that dark energy is simply an illusion stemming from our poor understanding of the laws of gravity - @entity0 's theory has passed its most stringent test yet at extra-galactic scales			1
’ @entity90 , professor of theoretical physics at the @entity16 and co-author with @entity93 of @entity94 : everything that can happen @entity96 , underlined just how important the study has been			0
he told @entity99 : ' understanding the cosmological constant represents possibly the biggest unsolved mystery in physics			0
@entity0 's theory anticipates its existence but modern theories of particle physics fail spectacularly to predict its value			1
accurate measurements like these are vital in order to unravel this conundrum			0
' ironically , he added , @entity0 thought his cosmological constant was a mistake and did n't like it at all			2
the experiment was designed to follow up on an observation made in 1998 , when scientists studied the brightness of mighty stellar explosions to deduce that the universe 's expansion is , against all odds and against our understanding of fundamental physics , becoming increasingly fast			2
the new discoveries are based on work by a collaboration of astronomers from across the globe representing the @entity129 ( @entity130 ) , part of the third @entity132 ( @entity133 ) , which is mapping the three - dimensional positions of more than one million galaxies			2
way to grow : the universe began 13.7billion years ago and is now expanding at a mind - boggling rate , for reasons that have yet to be discovered professor @entity141 , head of this team at the university 's @entity143 , said : ‘ @entity145 was only discovered 14 years ago , and there 's this feeling that we are still riding the wave of discovery			1
‘ it 's a very exciting time to be a cosmologist			2
’ ‘ we see the influence of dark energy on cosmic structure , but we have no idea what it is			1
the data gathered by this survey will help answer that question , ’ said @entity153 from the @entity154 and the director of @entity132 - @entity156 maps of the universe like @entity130 ’s show that galaxies and clusters of galaxies are clumped together into walls and filaments , with giant voids between			2
these structures grew out of subtle variations in density in the early universe , which bore the imprint of “ baryon acoustic oscillations ” -- pressure - driven acoustic ( sound ) waves that passed through the early universe			0
billions of years later , the record of these sound waves can still be read in our universe			0
‘ because of the regularity of the ancient sound waves , there ’s a slightly increased probability that any two galaxies today will be separated by about 500 million light - years , rather than 400 million or 600 million , ’ said @entity153			2
in a graph of the number of galaxy pairs by separation distance , that magic number of 500 million light - years shows up as a peak , so astronomers often speak of the ‘ peak separation ’			0
the position of this peak depends on the amount of dark energy in the universe			1
but measuring the distance between galaxies depends critically on having the right distances to the galaxies in the first place			0
that ’s where @entity130 comes in			0
‘ we ’ve detected the peak separation more clearly than ever before , ’ said @entity212 of @entity213			0
‘ these measurements allow us to determine the contents of the universe with unprecedented accuracy			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 's brain has gone on show as a star attraction at an exhibition of human brains			1
slice of genius : two sections of @entity0 's brain are on display at the @entity229 in @entity230 other brains on display at the @entity229 , @entity230 , include those of @entity234 and @entity235			1
the exhibition , brains : the mind as matter , includes more than 150 objects such as rare images of real brains , artworks , manuscripts , artefacts , videos and photography			0
curator dr @entity247 , art historian and @entity35 lecturer in visual culture , said : ‘ the exhibition shows how a single , fragile organ has become the object of modern society 's most profound hopes , fears and beliefs , and some of its most extreme practices and advanced technologies			0
‘ the different ways in which we have treated and represented real , physical brains open up a lot of questions about our collective minds			0
‘ the brain is the most complex entity in the known universe and the exhibition is a fascinating exploration of how humans have tried to come to terms with this infinitely mysterious organ			0

dark energy was only discovered 14 years ago
theory predicts how fast galaxies are moving apart
