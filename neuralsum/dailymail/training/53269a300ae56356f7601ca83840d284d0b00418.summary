if @entity3 ’s dismissive pre-match comments about @entity5 ’s glorious achievements seemed a little unkind then this was worse , much worse			2
and how @entity3 will have savoured it because here was a performance to encapsulate the point he had been trying to make			2
winning the @entity11 is all very well , he seemed to say on the eve of the game , but as a manager you can fluke it with a few good players and a bit of luck			2

building a powerful team , however , one capable of dominating over time and bulldozing all before them ? that is a different matter			2
@entity3 has the ability and he knows it			2
he has demonstrated it before and he is well on the way to repeating it			2
smug ? perhaps , but this @entity22 team is something to be smug about			1
they are clear at the top of the @entity83 and into the last 16 of the @entity11 as @entity85 winners			1
fluent and mobile , last night they tore @entity89 ’s @entity20 to shreds with goals from @entity52 , @entity57 , @entity60 , @entity59 and an own goal — all while barely conceding a chance			1
‘ very impressive , very complete , ’ purred @entity3			2
‘ top quality football for 90 minutes			1
very compact , very strong defensively , no mistakes			0
the team was so solid			0
everything under control and the result is a consequence of one team that played a fantastic match			0
” within the brutality there was beauty , the manager wanted to stress			0
‘ the players are very serious , ’ he said			0
‘ everything they do with big focus and ambition , but at the same time with this component which is something new in @entity22 football : this happiness , this flair , this beauty			1
the way they are doing things , we are very happy			0
’ for @entity89 it must have been agony			0
from the moment @entity52 opened the scoring with a back - post header from a second - minute corner , the outcome was barely in question			1
at 1 - 0 @entity20 ’s @entity36 hit the bar from long range but after that the @entity129 stretched the lead			1
@entity20 were diabolical in defence , listless in attack and booed and whistled by their own fans , which only made them more anxious			1
the songs of support from @entity22 ’s travelling support will have done little to ease the pain and humiliation for @entity89 against the club he served so successfully as player and manager			1
@entity52 heads @entity22 into the lead against @entity20 less than 90 seconds into their @entity11 clash goalkeeper @entity28 and @entity22 's @entity56 watch as @entity52 's header hits the back of the net in @entity147 @entity52 celebrates scoring @entity22 's fastest - ever goal in the @entity11 to put his side in front in @entity151 ‘ we are sorry for this performance , ’ said @entity89			1
‘ we showed them too much respect			0
we were n’t aggressive enough , we did n’t put enough pressure on them , and they were ice cold			2
it was a super , clinical performance from them			0
we conceded too much space and they have players able to exploit that			0
’ by the end the @entity166 must have wished his technical area would open up and swallow him			0
or that he had delayed his return to management until after this game			0
‘ the best comfort they can have is that they lost to the best team , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ they must be very sad with this result , but my experience tells me that when we lose against a team that is much better , then you have to accept it			0
it was not their fault			0
move on , win the next match and keep going			0
’ @entity57 sends a fierce drive into the net to double @entity22 's advantage as they slipped into cruise control in @entity151 @entity33 ( third left ) scores an own goal to effectively condemn his side to defeat before half time against @entity22 @entity33 ( fourth right ) reacts with anger after scoring past his own keeper to pile the pressure on the home side @entity20 's goalkeeper @entity28 saves a shot from @entity22 's @entity58 ( grounded ) as the visitors pushed forward ex-chelsea boss @entity5 acknowledges the travelling @entity201 fans that is the way @entity22 are going about their season			1
unbeaten for 19 games in all competitions , they have not lost since april			0
next up : another former @entity201 favourite , @entity207 , at @entity208 , who will tremble if he studies this game too closely			0
@entity22 ’s second goal , from @entity57 , followed an exquisite move featuring @entity212 and @entity54 , although goalkeeper @entity28 ought to have done better with the shot			1
the third crushed @entity20 before the interval when @entity33 headed into his own goal from another @entity54 corner			1
there was no yellow @entity22 shirt near @entity33 as he planted the ball into the top corner			1
more jeers followed @entity20 ’s players down the tunnel			0
@entity89 may be cherished by @entity22 fans , but he has work to do if he is to win hearts in @entity147			1
he made changes but @entity22 rolled on			1
@entity3 was able to take off @entity228 , @entity58 and @entity54 in the second half			0
@entity228 has a knock but is expected to be fit for saturday ’s game at @entity208			0
as the match went into the final 15 minutes , @entity60 tapped in the fourth , teed up by @entity57 , and then set up the fifth with a cross for @entity59 to score with his head			1
amid the emotion of @entity89 and his reunion it was easy to overlook that @entity3 has his own special connection with @entity147			1
it was here that he first won the @entity11 with @entity242 , before walking out to take the job at @entity244			0
ten years on , he is building another team which seems capable of challenging for the prize			0
@entity22 boss @entity3 talks tactics with his midfielder @entity58 as the @entity250 masterminds another victory in @entity252 @entity20 fans leave the stadium before half time after seeing @entity33 score an own goal to put @entity22 further in front @entity212 shouts as he is challenged by @entity20 's @entity37 in what was a feisty midfield battle @entity60 came off the bench to add gloss to the scoreline , firing home @entity22 's fourth goal at the @entity263 @entity60 celebrates as he and his @entity22 team - mates look forward to the knockout stages of the @entity11 next year @entity60 raced to the @entity22 bench to celebrate his goal after coming on as a substitute in the second half @entity59 completed @entity22 's five - star show with a fine back - post header from @entity60 's lifted cross @entity22 could have had more goals - @entity3			1

@entity52 headed the opener in the first two minutes to put the visitors in front
@entity22 doubled their lead through @entity57 's strike in @entity147
@entity33 's own goal made it 3 - 0 before @entity60 added a fourth
and @entity59 completed the scoring with a fine header at the back post
@entity22 's victory confirmed top spot in @entity85 and their place in the knockout stages
