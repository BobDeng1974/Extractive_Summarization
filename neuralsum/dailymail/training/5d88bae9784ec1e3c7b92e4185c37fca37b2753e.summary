by @entity0 published : 07:51 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 19:51 est , 16 november 2012 rebuttal : the economist ran a feature which irritated @entity5 officials because it implied they could bring down the euro touchy @entity5 politicians yesterday launched a blistering attack on a prestigious @entity10 business magazine after it branded @entity5 ' the time - bomb at the heart of @entity13 '			1
the front cover of the economist this week shows seven baguettes wrapped in the red , white and blue ribbon of the @entity5 with a lit fuse protruding from the centre			1
its lead article says president @entity23 's plans to cut @entity5 's public debt are not ambitious enough , jeopardising the future of the euro			1
the magazine , which is seen as supporting the single currency , accuses @entity5 leaders of delaying crucial reforms for far too long , claiming : ' you can not defy economics for long			1
' in a 14 - page special report it explains why @entity5 could become the biggest danger to @entity13 's single currency , adding : ' the crisis could hit next year			1
' but @entity5 's prime minister , @entity38 , denounced the economist 's cover			1
he told a @entity5 tv station : ' you are talking about a publication which is resorting to excess to sell copies			1
i can tell you that @entity5 is not at all impressed			1
' @entity5 industry minister @entity47 yesterday went on to a @entity5 radio show to tell of his fury at the article			1
' frankly , @entity51 has never been known for its sense of moderation , ' he said			1
mr @entity47 said the claims were ' worthy of @entity55 ' , a notoriously provocative @entity57 satirical magazine whose offices were firebombed last year after it published insulting cartoons of the @entity60 which infuriated @entity62			1
mr @entity38 travelled to @entity63 on thursday to explain @entity5 's efforts to boost its declining international competitiveness to @entity67 chancellor @entity66			1
the head of @entity5 's @entity71 employers ' association , @entity68 , also hit out at @entity51 's claims , describing them as ' completely exaggerated '			1
she said : ' in reality @entity51 is behind the times because its dossier was concluded before the government decisions to increase competitiveness			2
' at the same time , there is some truth in the report , which has @entity5 at the heart of @entity13 , [ and ] says that if @entity5 collapses then the whole of @entity13 collapses			2
' @entity5 's president @entity23 ( left ) and and his companion @entity86 leave the @entity87 in @entity57 debate : @entity5 president @entity23 's reforms are the subject of criticism because they do not stretch far enough however @entity51 's @entity13 editor , @entity93 , defended the publication on @entity5 radio yesterday			1
he said : ' it is a front cover that is designed to shock – to say that @entity5 has some serious economic problems and must reform its public spending , the public sector and the labour market			1
' it is a shock to encourage politicians to carry out reforms			0
not at all impressed : prime minister @entity38 ( front row , right ) denounced the magazine 's angle ' and i hope that mr @entity47 will also carry out these reforms			1
' @entity109 mr @entity23 was elected president in may this year			0
but his popularity has plunged as he struggles to fulfil promises to reduce @entity5 's public deficit while kick - starting the economy when unemployment has risen to a 17 - year high			2
meanwhile he has also managed to antagonise business leaders and entrepreneurs with a string of left - wing policies including a 75 per cent top rate of income tax and a reduction in the pension age			0
along with criticism for the lack of reform , many economists and @entity127 officials are sceptical that @entity5 can hit its target of cutting its public deficit to 3 per cent of output by 2013			2
failure to do so could prompt financial markets to demand higher rates of interest for @entity57 government bonds , which are currently held at rates of around 2 per cent , as @entity5 , along with @entity67 , is viewed as a safe haven in the eurozone			2
@entity5 has skilfully manoeuvred itself though the eurozone crisis by maintaining that it is different			2
by hanging on to the skirts of @entity67 's @entity66 , it has gambled that the world and the financial markets would not notice that it has been slipping ever more deeply into the mire			0
@entity23 , the country 's lacklustre @entity109 president , swept into office on the back of the dislike of his predecessor @entity153 , and the belief that he could deliver a growth agenda that could restore jobs and repair the financial system			0
what he failed to recognise was that his country was hugely exposed to its weaker neighbours , had deficit and debt problems as bad as most of its neighbours and a bloated state sector so large it was in danger of exploding			0
all of this was pointed out earlier this week in an excoriating report card from the @entity170 - based @entity169 – which paradoxically has a @entity5 boss , @entity172 – without provoking much reaction in @entity57			2
but when the shortcomings were featured as the cover story in this week 's economist , under the provocative headline ' the time - bomb at the heart of @entity13 ' , @entity23 and his ministers went into overdrive			0
it is one thing being given a scolding by the @entity169			0
it is quite another for ' @entity186 ' to question the stability of @entity5 's fifth republic			2
for many businessmen and financiers around the world , having @entity51 on conspicuous display is regarded as a status symbol , so a cover suggesting one of the richest nations on the world is in danger of tipping over the edge is bound to have an impact on how @entity5 is viewed			1
the economist contends that the problems looming in @entity5 could dwarf the woes of @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207			2
the respected weekly magazine argues that the fragility of the @entity5 economy has been cruelly laid bare in the eurozone crisis			1
many of its firms are uncompetitive because they are swamped by high taxes and mountains of red tape , as well as a notoriously strike - prone labour force			0
in its analysis , @entity51 claims that membership of the single currency has acted as a straitjacket on @entity5 because it means the country can not allow its currency to devalue			1
the reality is that @entity5 has never gone through the @entity227 reforms that made the @entity10 so competitive over the two decades leading up to the great financial crisis			0
@entity5 's unique form of economic nationalism meant that whenever it felt the hot breath of competition from overseas , it simply closed ranks to keep the outsiders out			0
@entity23 has not helped since he took over			0
instead of shrinking the public sector , he decided to prop up the company and to soak the rich			0
the decision to raise the top rate of income tax to 75 per cent , the highest level in the advanced world , sent wealth creators scurrying overseas to @entity10 and friendly climes			0
the truth is that @entity5 is in terrible difficulty			0
trapped within the eurozone , it has no means of escaping its woes by devaluing its currency , or adjusting its interest rates or monetary policy that is set by the @entity253 in @entity254			0
this year the @entity5 economy already has moved into recession and now the @entity169 is forecasting that it will grow by just 0.4 per cent next year			0
despite its enormous problems the financial markets have tended to give @entity5 the benefit of the doubt believing that its commitment to the euro project would allow it to escape the worst of the eurozone 's problems			0
time for @entity23 and his leftist allies in @entity267 is rapidly running out and the country could quickly be sucked into the vortex of financial crisis that is destroying social cohesion all over @entity13			0
if that happens it could be the final act for the single currency with @entity67 and the rich @entity276 tier fleeing from what increasingly looks to be a doomed project .			0
