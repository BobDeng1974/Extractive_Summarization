an audio recording of underwater sounds might have captured the moment @entity2 crashed into the ocean			1
the low - frequency sound was picked up by underwater listening devices in the @entity6 off the west coast of @entity8 on march 8 , the same day the @entity9 disappeared on a flight from @entity11 , @entity12 , to @entity13 with 239 people on board			1
researchers at @entity17 in @entity8 have been analysing the signal to see if it may be the sound of the plane crashing into the ocean			1
the recording would place the missing plane in the central @entity6 â€“ nearly 5,000km from @entity24 on the @entity26 coastline , outside the original southern @entity6 search zone			1
magenta points and text show the locations of the various recording stations the low - frequency noise was picked up by two devices near the @entity26 coast , just off @entity24 and @entity47			2
the sound was detected at 1.30am , on march 8 , ten minutes after @entity2 lost contact with air traffic control			1
' one signal has been detected on several receivers that could be related to the crash , ' dr @entity51 , a senior research fellow with the @entity52 told @entity56			1
the researchers have calculated an ' uncertainty box ' for the signal 's origin			0
the box stretches some 4,000 kilometers in length from southeast to northwest across the @entity6			0
at its widest point it spans some 200 to 300 kilometers in width			0
these are the type of @entity68 that captured the possible @entity2 noise			2
they are programmed autonomous underwater acoustic receivers , capable of recording underwater sound for many months ' the sound was heard very approximately 5000km from @entity24			2
it 's a very rubbery number , ' dr @entity51 told @entity74			1
the scientist said he is only ' 10 per cent ' sure that the noise came from @entity2 hitting the water or the implosion of parts of the aircraft as it sank			1
' we 've been very up front that this is fairly unlikely to be revealed to be @entity2			0
' dr @entity51 does not believe that releasing this new information will give false to hope the families who have lost their loved ones , instead he thinks it will come as a reassurance			1
' i think it will be reassuring for families to know people are beavering away in the background ... despite the fact that what we 've found is not going to help a lot			0
' @entity17 researchers have used underwater sound recordings to come up with a possible estimate for where @entity2 might have crashed			1
one of the recordings was taken at @entity47 ( shown in this map ) unfortunately the locations of the sound recordings do not match up with the original search arc plotted in the southern @entity6 , where 26 nations , using either ships , aircraft or technical expertise , have been searching the waters off the @entity114 coast			0
he believes the most likely source of the noise was probably an earthquake or other natural event			0
however , dr @entity51 claimed search teams are still ' probably going to take a look there ' and that he and his team will ' keep chipping away ' at trying to locate the plane			1
' i certainly would if i was them			0
there 's certainly not a lot else to go on			0
' the data that he and his team at @entity17 have uncovered has already attracted significant interest from search authorities			0
' they 've been encouraging us considerably to keep on looking at it and to refine the numbers			0
i 've been over to @entity138 to talk to them and we continue to have a very close relationship with them , ' dr @entity51 told @entity142			1
the acoustic signals recorded by the @entity144 ( @entity144 ) sound recorder west of @entity47 ( top ) and by one of the hydrophones of the @entity151 's @entity150 hydroacoustic station off @entity24 ( bottom )			2
arrows show the arrival time at each station of the peak energy of the signal , thought to possibly be @entity2 crashing into the @entity6 one of the underwater listening devices that recorded the low frequency sound is located some 20 kilometres off @entity26			2
it 's designed to listen to whales and other marine life but it can also detect black box ' pings ' in the 30 - 40 khz range			0
another of the devices is designed to listen for signs of underwater nuclear explosions it 's operated by the @entity172 - chartered @entity171 ( @entity151 ) as part of the @entity174			0
seismic acoustic analyst with the @entity151 @entity175 told @entity56 that it 's possible for the devices to record a plane crash ' but the circumstances that would allow it would have to be very particular '			0
the @entity181 , who are organising the search for the missing plane , said they would consider @entity17 's findings but said : ' the current results are not compatible with the international search team 's analysis of the most likely area where @entity2 entered the water			1
' the search for the missing plane is now focused on the southern @entity6 , which is 5,000km from where the sound was recorded			2

researchers from @entity17 recorded underwater sounds the same day @entity2 lost contact
the @entity32 plane went missing on march 8
the ' dull oomph ' could have been the sound of the plane hitting water
the noise would place the plane 5,000km off @entity24 , @entity8
@entity208 's dr @entity51 said information should be ' reassuring ' to families
