by @entity0 a first impression about can be formed in as little as a tenth of a second , but it is possible to influence what judgement is made			2
scientists have discovered that people with faces that others do n’t trust can pull an expression to make them appear more honest			2
faces deemed untrustworthy , dominant or unattractive because of their shape can be made to appear the opposite by making specific facial expressions			1
fake it to make it : faces deemed untrustworthy , dominant or unattractive because of their shape can be made to appear the opposite by making specific facial expressions , scientists have said			1
an untrustworthy face ( pictured left ) can be transformed into a trustworthy one ( right ) by raising the eyebrows and smiling slightly researchers used software to generate @entity26 animated images of faces that can be programmed to move one or more of 42 individual groups of facial muscles			1
twelve volunteers judged randomly generated facial expressions on trustworthiness , dominance and attractiveness			0
from this , the experts pinpointed which aspects of an expression conveyed these particular characteristics			0
they asked different volunteers to rate faces with neutral expressions for the same traits based solely on facial structure			0
to test whether the neutral faces deemed untrustworthy , dominant or unattractive could be made to appear trustworthy , submissive and attractive , they animated the second set of faces with the expressions identified with these characteristics from the first experiment			1
faces thought to look untrustworthy could be made more honest - looking by activating a few muscle groups to form a more virtuous expression and dominant faces could appear meeker			1
this ‘ social camouflage ’ can be used by people with untrustworthy faces to override the default impression others form by looking at their face			1
for example , raising the eyebrows and smiling slightly can make someone appear more honest , while wrinkling the nose slightly can affect a look of dominance			1
‘ humans communicate a lot through their facial expressions when negotiating various social situations , ’ said dr @entity66 , a psychologist of @entity67			2
‘ but whether we like it or not , previous well - documented research has shown people tend to perceive certain personality characteristics or traits in individuals based on the structure of their face			2
‘ this means some people can be judged to be untrustworthy or domineering simply by how they look - a square jaw and large brow conveying dominance for example			1
' @entity87 camouflage ' can be used by people with untrustworthy faces to override the default impression others form by looking at their face			1
here , the facial movements required to look more or less dominant are shown ‘ it can have implications for things like mate selection and job opportunities			0
‘ however there are also basic facial movements people identify with specific social traits and these movements can override the default impression people have of another person 's face			1
’ to appear more trustworthy , people should raise their inner and outer brow and smile slightly with their mouth closed to show dimples , according to the study			1
dr @entity107 said : ‘ if you 're going for a job interview it 's best to feign happiness and surprise because this looks more honest to an observer			0
‘ but an army commander would put on a sterner , more dominant look than someone who is going out for a romantic encounter			0
’ a more dominant look can be achieved by wrinkling the nose and raising the upper lip so the mouth is open slightly			1
dr @entity107 explained that people often adopt these faces without realising it and that animals do the same thing			0
dr @entity107 said that there are also basic facial movements people identify with specific social traits - such as trustworthiness ( pictured - and these movements can override the default impression people have of another person 's face			1
lots of people adopt suitable expressions without realising it ‘ rhesus monkeys for instance have different faces according to their hierarchical rank - the highest ranking have dominant faces while the lesser mortals ' are more submissive , ’ he said			1
the study , published in the journal @entity148 , said that attractiveness is harder to feign			0
this is because the perception of attractiveness is based on many more factors than just facial expressions , as any casting director will know , mr @entity66 explained			0
‘ an actor can certainly look more dominant or trustworthy according to their role - but would probably struggle to look more attractive			2
for that you 'd really need an attractive actor			0
’ in the experiment , researchers used software to generate @entity26 animated images of faces that can be programmed to move one or more of 42 individual facial groups of muscles to pull a certain face			2
they then asked a group of 12 volunteers to judge a set of randomly generated facial expressions on trustworthiness , dominance and attractiveness			0
this allowed the researchers to ascertain which aspects of an expression conveyed these particular characteristics			0
attractiveness is harder to feign , according to the study			0
this is because the perception of attractiveness is based on many more factors than just facial expressions , dr @entity107 explained they repeated this procedure again with a different set of volunteers asking them to rate static faces with neutral expressions for the same traits but based solely on facial structure			0
to test whether the neutral faces deemed untrustworthy , dominant or unattractive could be made to appear trustworthy , submissive and attractive , they animated the second set of faces with the expressions identified with these characteristics from the first experiment			1
faces thought to look untrustworthy could be made more honest - looking simply by activating a few muscle groups to form a more virtuous expression			2
similarly dominant faces could appear meeker through a different expression			0
study co-author professor @entity208 said : ‘ this is the first study to examine how dynamic facial expressions affect the perception of social traits or characteristics			0

faces deemed untrustworthy , dominant or unattractive because of their shape can be made to appear the opposite by moving certain muscles
‘ @entity87 camouflage ’ can be used by people with untrustworthy faces to override the default impression others form by looking at their face
to appear more trustworthy , people should raise their inner and outer brow and smile slightly with their mouth closed
dominance can be faked by wrinkling the nose and raising the upper lip
