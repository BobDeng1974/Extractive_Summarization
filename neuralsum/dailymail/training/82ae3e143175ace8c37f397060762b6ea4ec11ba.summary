this striking image of two galaxies colliding , taken with the @entity12 , shows what looks like the profile of a celestial bird , hovering protectively over an egg			1
but both are fully certified galaxies which can be found in the constellation @entity19 , 326million light years away			0
this striking image of two galaxies colliding , taken with the @entity21 , shows what looks like the profile of a celestial bird , hovering protectively over an egg the ' penguin ' as @entity28 experts have likened it to , is the star - forming spiral galaxy @entity29 and would normally look very much like the @entity31 - a flat , spiral disk			1
but the orbits of the galaxy 's stars have become scrambled due to gravitational tidal interactions with the other galaxy , @entity29 2937 , positioned to the lower left			0
the egg shaped galaxy has pulled and elongated the spiral with its gravity , forcing the galaxy 's shape to completely reform			1
the penguin is among a number of ' animal inspired ' shapes which astronomers have noted int he night skies , including the @entity3 this image from the @entity12 shows the entire @entity2 , which was first observed by the @entity52 nearly 1000 years ago gas and dust drawn from the heart of @entity29 becomes compressed during the encounter , which in turn triggers star formation			2
these bluish knots are visible along the distorted arms that are closest to the companion elliptical			0
the reddish dust , once within the galaxy , has been thrown out of the galaxy 's plane and into dark veins that are silhouetted against the bright starlight from what is left of the nucleus and disk			0
the companion elliptical , @entity29 2937 , is a puffball of stars with little gas or dust present			0
the beautiful , but distorted shapes are usually caused when two or more galaxies venture too close to each other , ' exchanging matter and causing havoc ' .			1

astronomers compare it to a bird , hovering protectively over an egg
*unusual* shape is caused by galaxies ' exchanging matter and causing havoc '
