by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:19 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 02:06 est , 3 february 2013 two days before president @entity4 's first trip outside @entity5 to promote his gun - control proposals , the @entity2 tried on saturday to settle a brewing mystery by releasing a photo to back his claim to be a skeet shooter			1
@entity4 had set inquiring minds spinning when , in an interview with @entity14 magazine , he answered ‘ yes ’ when asked if he had ever fired a gun			2
the admission came as a surprise to many			0
‘ yes , in fact , up at @entity22 , we do skeet shooting all the time , ’ @entity4 said in the interview released last weekend , referring to the official presidential retreat in rural @entity19 , which he last visited in october while campaigning for re-election			1
guns a blazing : the @entity2 released this picture , taken on aug. 4 , of the president skeet shooting after skeptics questioned mr @entity4 's claim that he enjoyed shooting at @entity22 former @entity2 senior adviser @entity32 took to @entity33 to mock those who might claim the photograph of president @entity4 shooting a firearm is fake @entity2 communications director @entity38 joined in the teasing by posting the @entity4 pic from his official @entity33 account @entity42 looks to the sky during a dove hunt in @entity45 , @entity46 in 2004 asked whether the entire family participates , the president said : ‘ not the girls , but oftentimes guests of mine go up there			1
’ then on saturday morning , the @entity2 released the photo of @entity4 shooting at clay pigeons at the presidential retreat at @entity22 in @entity19			1
former @entity2 senior adviser @entity32 could n't resist mocking those who might claim the photograph of president @entity4 shooting was fake and tweeted : ' attention skeet birthers			1
make our day - let the photoshop conspiracies begin ! ' @entity2 communications director @entity38 also joined in the teasing and tweeted the picture of the president with a shout - out to the ' skeeters ' - namely people who might claim the image is false			1
both men received a large amount of online abuse for their attempts at humor			0
the image of a @entity74 president holding a gun is certainly nothing new			2
a number of men who have held the highest office in @entity74 have been pictured holding guns , from @entity80 to @entity42			1
president @entity81 holds a @entity82 during a ceremony at the @entity2 in 1994 , where he launched efforts to pass the assault weapons ban president @entity86 displays a rifle given to him as a gift , in @entity89 , @entity90 in 1992 the shooting range at @entity22 was installed by president @entity92 in the 1950s			1
the retired army general enjoyed shooting and even brought visiting dignitaries , including @entity95 , to join him			0
presidents @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity86 are among the former @entity74 leaders who have also been photographed packing heat			1
mr @entity4 's predecessor , 43rd president @entity42 , is an avid hunter who enjoyed the sport at his ranch in @entity104 , @entity46 - which was dubbed the ' western @entity2 ' during his tenure			1
his vice-president , @entity106 , also enjoyed the practice but landed in a tight spot when he accidentally hit his shooting companion , @entity46 millionaire @entity110 , while quail hunting on a @entity46 ranch in february 2006			2
the image of president @entity4 shooting at clay targets was released at a time when he is pushing a package of gun - control measures in response to the @entity122 , @entity121 , school shooting			1
the @entity123 , which has rejected @entity4 's proposals , scoffed at the photo			1
‘ one picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun - control scheme imaginable , ’ said @entity126 , the organization 's spokesman			2
president @entity98 sights down the barrel of a shotgun in @entity135 in 1984 presidential pastime : @entity97 skeet shooting at @entity22 with actor @entity137 and @entity139 editor @entity138 in may 1963 the @entity123 opposes @entity4 's call for @entity141 to ban assault weapons and high - capacity ammunition magazines and says requiring background checks for all gun purchases would be ineffective because the administration is n't doing enough to enforce existing gun laws			1
asked at monday 's press briefing how frequently @entity4 shoots skeet and whether photos existed , @entity2 press secretary @entity150 said he did n't know how often			1
pictures may exist , he said , but he had n't seen any			0
‘ why have n't we heard about it before ? ’ @entity150 was asked			0
‘ because when he goes to @entity22 , he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax , not to produce photographs , ’ @entity150 said			0
@entity4 is accompanied almost everywhere by at least one @entity2 photographer			2
@entity150 declined to comment on the decision to release the photo , which he had announced on @entity33			0
the release appeared to be part of a strategy to portray @entity4 as sympathetic to gun owners and opponents of his gun - control measures who argue the proposals would infringe on an individual 's @entity172 right to bear arms			2
gen. @entity175 , @entity176 invasion chief , fires a @entity178 light machine gun using his hip as a mount , during an inspection of an infantry unit in @entity183 in 1944 president @entity184 shoots at clay pigeons at his vacation home on the @entity187 , @entity188 , in 1928 a top official with the @entity190 said the photo suggests @entity4 is a novice shooter			1
‘ this is n't something he 's done very often because of how he 's standing , how he has the gun mounted , ’ said @entity193 , executive director of the @entity195 - based association			0
@entity193 said @entity4 's remark about ‘ skeet shooting all the time ’ and the @entity2 photo would have met less skepticism had the president spoken about his hobby months before this new debate over guns in the @entity74 ‘ once it becomes controversial and there 's problems , to talk about it then , that 's where it becomes very debatable and is not being received as well as if he would have done this six months ago , ’ @entity193 said			1
in interview , appearing in @entity14 's feb. 11 issue , @entity4 said gun - control advocates should be better listeners in the debate over firearms , which was sparked by the december killing of elementary school pupils in @entity121			2
he also declared his deep respect for the long tradition of hunting in this country			0
‘ i have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations			0
and i think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake , ’ @entity4 said			0
president @entity80 , posing as an ' outdoorsman ' points his rifle during a studio photo session , date unknown ‘ part of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas			0
and if you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were 10 , and you went out and spent the day with him and your uncles , and that became part of your family 's traditions , you can see why you 'd be pretty protective of that			0
’ ' so it 's trying to bridge those gaps that i think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months			0
and that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes , ' @entity4 said			0
his gun control measures also have met resistance on @entity265			0
in @entity266 on monday , @entity4 plans to make remarks and discuss his proposals with local and law enforcement officials during a stop at the police department 's special operations center			2
he 's also expected to hear from community members about their experiences with gun violence			0
@entity4 announced his proposals in mid-january , about a month after the dec. 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at @entity280 in @entity122 , @entity121			2
