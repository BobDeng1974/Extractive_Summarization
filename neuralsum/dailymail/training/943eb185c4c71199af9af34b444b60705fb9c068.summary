republicans also easily replaced retiring @entity3 senators in @entity5 and @entity6			2

they include @entity37 from @entity38 , @entity39 from @entity40 , @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 in @entity44 and @entity45 in @entity46 , who were all running for @entity2			0

and former gov. @entity59 of @entity6 won retiring @entity3 sen. @entity61 's seat			1
@entity62 , of @entity38 , won a sixth term of his own , and immediately warned @entity64 of coming confrontations			0
@entity41 lost in @entity42 no luck : @entity30 's support of @entity54 governor hopeful @entity51 ( above ) did not lead to a victory for the current lieutenant governor of that state @entity45 lost in @entity46 ' for too long , this administration has tried to tell the @entity73 people what 's good for them and then blame somebody else when their policies did n't work out , ' @entity62 told cheering fans			1
@entity62 and @entity8 , an @entity78 combat veteran and @entity80 graduate , joined virtually every other @entity56 nationwide in relentlessly linking their opponent to the president whose popularity has sagged			0
@entity9 , the last @entity18 in @entity7 ' congressional delegation , is the son of a popular former governor and senator			0
but @entity7 and @entity5 have been trending sharply @entity56			2

but the hill was too steep in a state @entity64 lost by 23 percentage points in 2012			0
@entity62 's allies taunted @entity37 for refusing to say whether she had voted for @entity64			0
@entity56 @entity2 candidate @entity59 of @entity6 campaigns with supporters during the morning commute in @entity104 senate minority leader @entity105 is joined by his wife , former labor secretary @entity106 , as they celebrate with his supporters at an election night party in @entity110 , @entity38 republicans also celebrated sen. @entity111 becoming the first black elected to the @entity2 from a former @entity113 state since @entity114			2
