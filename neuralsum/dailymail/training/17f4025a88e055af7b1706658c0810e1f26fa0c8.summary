lighting storms are impressive displays of nature 's power - but up until now scientists had n’t realised that they could also sculpt mountains			1
a team of researchers from @entity8 recently discovered that a single lightning bolt could , for example , blow three to 10 cubic metres ( 100 to 350 cubic feet ) out of bedrock			2
this goes against the current assumptions that the peaks above 3,050 metres ( 10,000ft ) tend to break down over hundreds of thousands of years			1
lighting storms are impressive displays of nature 's power - but up until now scientists had n't realised that they could also sculpt mountains the discovery was made by professor @entity19 while studying the @entity21 mountains in @entity22 , southern @entity23			1
previous theories claim that water melting and freezing inside cracks causes the rocks on mountains to break into pieces as they expand and break off			1
the @entity31 , the @entity32 and the @entity33 were thought to have been shaped in this way , for example			2
but unlike these formations , professor @entity19 believes that lightning was the main cause behind the creation of the mountain landscapes in southern @entity23 in @entity22 's @entity21 mountains , for instance , the team found that a single lightning bolt could blow three to 10 cubic metres ( 100 to 350 cubic feet ) out of bedrock new research done on the @entity21 mountains in @entity23 debunks previous suggestions that cold temperatures played a dominate role in mountain formation the hit : @entity53 strickes the rock surface			1
the heat - which is around 27760 ºc - vapourises water that is stored in the cracks			0
the explosion : the force of the vapourised water explosed the rocke , moving 10 tonnes of debris as far as 10 metres ( 30 feet ) away			0
new cracks help to continue the process of weathering			0
in @entity22 's @entity21 mountains , for instance , the team found that a single lightning bolt could blow three to 10 cubic metres ( 100 to 350 cubic feet ) out of bedrock			1

his team used a compass to prove their theory			1
‘ a compass needle always points to magnetic north , ’ said professor grab 's colleague professor @entity77			1
‘ but when you pass a compass over a land ’s surface , if the minerals in the rock have a strong enough magnetic field , the compass will read the magnetic field of the rock , which corresponds to when it was formed			1
‘ in the @entity92 , there are a lot of basalt rocks which contain a lot of magnetic minerals , so they ’ve got a very strong magnetic signal			0
’ if a compass is passed over an area where a lightning strike occurred , its needle will suddenly swing through 360 degrees			1
‘ the energy of the lightning hitting the land ’s surface can , for a short time , partially melt the rock and when the rock cools down again , ’ added ‘ it takes on the magnetic imprint of today ’s magnetic field , not the magnetic field of millions of years ago when the rock was originally formed			1
’ because of the movement of continents , magnetic north for the newly formed rock will be different from that of the older rock around it			2
professor @entity77 and professor grab mapped out the distribution of lightning strikes in the @entity92 and discovered that lightning significantly controls the evolution of the mountain landscapes because it helps to shape the summit areas with this blasting effect			2
previously , angular debris was assumed to have been created by changes typical of cold , glacial environments , such as fracturing due to frost			2
@entity133 enters cracks in rocks and when it freezes , it expands , causing the rocks to split apart			0
‘ many people have considered mountains to be pretty passive agents , just sitting there to be affected by cold climates over these long periods of time , ’ said professor @entity77			0
‘ this evidence suggests that that is completely wrong			0
@entity147 mountain landscapes sometimes evolve very quickly and very dramatically over short periods of time			2
these are actually very sensitive environments and we need to know more about them			0
’ previously , angular debris was assumed to have been created by changes typical of cold , glacial environments , such as fracturing due to frost the research team also attempted to quantify how much debris was moved by such blasts , which can cause boulders weighing several tonnes to move tens of metres			0
the stability of the land ’s surface has important implications for the people living near the mountains			0
‘ if we have lots of debris being generated it ’s going to flow down slope and this is associated with hazards such as landslides , ’ said professor @entity77			0
mountains are also inextricably linked to food security and water supply			0
in @entity22 , a country crucial to @entity23 ’s water supply , food shortages are leading to overgrazing , exposing the rock surface and making mountain landscapes even more vulnerable to weathering by lightning			1
professor @entity77 hopes the research will help to put in place monitoring and mitigation to try and counteract some of the effects			0
‘ the more we increase our understanding , the more we are able to do something about it , ’ he said .			0

previous theories claim mountains break down over thousands of years
this is said to be due to temperature changes in the mountainous rock
scientists now believe mountains in @entity23 were shaped by lightning
they proved their theory by monitoring changes on a compass needle
areas where a lightning struck caused the needle to swing 360 degrees
this suggests the mountains evolved ' very quickly and very dramatically '
