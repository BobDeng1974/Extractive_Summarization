by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:11 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 20:02 est , 6 august 2012 when their women 's 4 x 100m freestyle relay team swam to gold on the opening night of the @entity7 , millions of @entity2 thought the sleep deprivation necessary to watch the @entity9 would be worth it			1
and though that tally was n't immediately built upon , they could still delight in a barren start for the brits on their home turf			0
the @entity16 took great pleasure on the fourth day of competition in pointing out that @entity19 had three more gold medals than the hosts - ' @entity22 ! ' they screamed			1
the whole of @entity2 looked forward to the inevitable avalanche of precious metal			1
@entity26 won @entity2 's second gold medal of the @entity7 in the men 's laser class sailing today , 11 days after the first it all started so well for the @entity2 when ( left to right ) @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 took gold in the women 's 4 x 100m freestyle relay on @entity39 but their mickey - taking has backfired in spectacular fashion - sure , @entity26 took gold in the sailing laser class at @entity45 today but the @entity2 ' total after 10 days of the @entity7 still stands at a measly two gold medals			1
and it is worth pointing out now that this is less than @entity19 - and @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and 20 other nations			1
@entity55 , by contrast , has 16 golds and third place in the standings			1
while @entity59 has seen a gold rush just about every day , @entity2 is currently averaging one medal every six			1
long before the closing ceremony , the @entity63 authorities , press and bleary - eyed armchair pundits @entity62 have already accepted that its athletes have put on their worst performance in 36 years			0
at the @entity69 in 1976 , they failed to win a single gold but the impressive hauls in every games from @entity73 1992 onwards made @entity2 an @entity63 superpower			1
but even the most patriotic fan would struggle to convince anyone that @entity2 are having a good @entity7 , despite 12 silvers and seven bronzes			2
@entity2 's @entity79 ( left ) was favourite in the long jump , only to be beaten by @entity55 's @entity81 ( centre ) the fact this is the first @entity7 reported second - by - second on @entity84 and other social media is n't helping the @entity2 mood			1
brits joked over the weekend about ' @entity88 ' - a condition caused by scrolling down the medal table			1
other tweeters pointed out that if @entity93 was a country , it would have more gold to cheer than @entity2			1
nothing epitomised the hurt more than @entity2 long jumper @entity79 , who was the favourite , coming second to @entity55 ’s @entity81 on saturday night			1
referring to that event , one newspaper suggested that if a book was ever written about @entity2 at the @entity7 it could be called second to a @entity102			2
even the men 's hockey team - ranked number one in the world - chucked away a three - goal lead against @entity59 yesterday			0
but it is n't just the @entity109 dishing out the punishment			0
the @entity2 @entity7 have been in free - fall ever since pre-race favourite @entity112 was pipped to gold by the @entity115 @entity114 in the 100m freestyle swimming final by 0.01 seconds			1
@entity112 was ashen - faced afterwards and his night did n't get any better when @entity2 finished fourth and outside the medals in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay			2
the losses came as a shock to an @entity2 public well used to seeing the likes of @entity123 and @entity124 dominating in the pool			2
the @entity126 described the @entity127 of the pool as facing his kryptonite after he failed to win any golds			0
and their relay triumph aside , @entity131 has also brought heartbreak for two female swimmers - @entity135 and @entity136 - who were considered dead certs for gold , at least in @entity2			1
@entity139 failed to medal at all in the 200m and 400m @entity143 finals and said she was considering calling time on her career , while @entity136 claimed social media had made her complacent after taking silver in the 100m backstroke			0
the debate that followed @entity2 's failure in the pool was quickly magnified and applied to the other sports as the expected golds failed to materialise			1
in a front page story , @entity2 's swimming boss @entity154 blamed the nation 's ' easy life ' society and small population for the results			2
' we live in a society where people look for the easy way , ' he said			0
@entity112 looks horrified as he glances up at the scoreboard to see he has lost to @entity115 's @entity166 by just 0.01 seconds in the 100m freestyle final swimmer @entity136 reacts with bewilderment after finishing second in the 100m backstroke , just one of a string of disappointing results for @entity2 in the first week of the @entity7 on a higher level , @entity2 @entity63 chef de mission @entity173 said that while silver was not a dirty word , there would be a post mortem on what had gone with the team ’s performance			2
the inquest will have to include rowing , beach volleyball and track cycling			0
in the latter , @entity55 dominated as @entity2 foundered			1
@entity135 is considering her future in the sport of swimming after missing out on any medals in her two events the @entity2 beach volleyball player @entity192 can only stare at the sand after another point goes begging @entity195 ( right in yellow ) trails her great rival , @entity197 of @entity55 , in the women 's keirin the so - called ' ashes on wheels ' went decisively in @entity55 's favour - almost a series whitewash			1
and it got worse on monday night as @entity204 could only manage bronze in the men 's sprint			0
@entity208 are being pointed in all directions			0
some , including @entity210 , @entity2 's senior member of the @entity211 , blame the government for slashing funding for sport			2
' the money is the difference between silver and gold , ' he said			0
but @entity26 's gold will offer a brief respite from the recriminations			0
the world champion held off a strong challenge from the @entity225 @entity224 in today 's medal race at @entity45			0
the @entity2 , 27 , kept his rival behind him at the back of field to take overall victory			2
' words just ca n't describe how i feel now , ' @entity26 said			0
' it 's been a long road and i 've been through the highs and lows of this sport but nothing beats this			0
' i 've worked so hard			0
the @entity7 is the dream , the pinnacle of the sport and right now i 'm the happiest guy on the planet , i can guarantee it			0
' he may have realised his dream but there 's no escaping the fact that the @entity7 has been a nightmare for the @entity2 team .			0

@entity2 finally get second gold medal in sailing laser class , 10 days after their first
still *languishing* behind @entity19 , @entity52 , @entity253 and @entity254 in medal table
@entity55 third in medal table with 16 golds
