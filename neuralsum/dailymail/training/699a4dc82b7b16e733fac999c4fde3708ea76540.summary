sheik @entity0 has dramatically reshuffled his jockey plans for 2015 by signing up @entity2 and @entity3 , two of the @entity5 ’ brightest talents , for his @entity8 empire			1
@entity9 will ride the @entity8 horses trained by @entity11 while @entity3 will partner those under the care of @entity13			1
both jockeys will provide crossover cover when required			0
@entity2 ( left ) and @entity3 are to join sheik @entity0 's @entity8 stable in addition , they will also ride @entity8 horses with @entity20 and other trainers which have until now run in the colours of the @entity0 ’s wife @entity24			1
@entity25 will continue to ride @entity8 horses trained in @entity27 but @entity29 ’s position as a @entity8 jockey has ended			1
@entity8 riding plans have been unsatisfactory since the ending of @entity34 ’s 18 - year association			2
shamed by last year ’s @entity37 scandal , they have endured a poor 2014 in @entity38 with the @entity40 victory of @entity11 ’s @entity9 - ridden @entity41 thought their sole success at @entity44			1
it is a meagre return for such a lavishly funded operation and one coming under further pressure from the increased involvement of @entity50 owners in @entity52 racing			0
signing @entity9 and @entity3 is a statement of intent from the @entity0 , as was spending over £ 20million on yearlings at the prestigious @entity57 1 sale			1
@entity9 ( right ) rides renew to victory in the @entity59 on @entity60 earlier this month the capture of @entity3 is most surprising			1
he has walked away from the job as first jockey to prince @entity64 , owner of this year ’s champion miler @entity67 and @entity69 winner @entity66			0
@entity3 said : ‘ i have had a wonderful season riding for @entity71 and prince @entity64 during which i was fortunate to ride the best horse of my career so far in @entity67			2
‘ @entity66 was another great racehorse produced by @entity71 that helped bring my career forward			0
‘ i shall always be eternally grateful for that one - year contract which leaves me with great memories			0
now i look forward to sharing riding duties with @entity2 at @entity8 and continue to achieve great things in the world of horse racing			1
’ @entity3 ( centre ) and @entity84 ( left ) celebrate with @entity66 after winning the @entity85 at @entity86 last month @entity2 added : ‘ i have been very fortunate to have been employed by @entity20 since i completed my apprenticeship and without his faith and wise counsel i would not be in the position that i am in today to take what is , in my opinion , the most coveted position in world racing			2
‘ @entity20 has shown me great loyalty and given me access to classic winners and success on a world stage			0
no jockey has had a better mentor			0
now i am looking forward to sharing the @entity8 riding arrangements with my very good friend @entity103			0
‘ both of us have had to make hard decisions but no one has made a commitment to world racing like @entity0 and it is an honour for both of us to be invited to be a part of his team			0
’ @entity9 and @entity3 flew out of @entity113 on saturday evening to meet the @entity0 in @entity114			2
his bloodstock adviser @entity115 said : ‘ this is yet another clear indication of @entity8 ’s pursuit of excellence in both horses and humans .			2

@entity2 and @entity3 will be joint no 1 jockeys at @entity8
@entity9 will ride horses trained by @entity11
@entity3 will ride horses under the care of @entity13
