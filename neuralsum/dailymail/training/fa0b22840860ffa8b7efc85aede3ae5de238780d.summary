researchers found that those in weight loss groups sought support during the beginning of the regimes we all feel good when we shed a few pounds â€“ but a little known side - effect is that we can lose friends at the same time			1
a study of weight loss groups found members are very supportive of each other at the start			1
however , as they become thinner they get more competitive and chilly towards their fellow slimmers , according to research yesterday			0
instead of passing each other dieting tips and meal plans , they begin to keep their secrets to themselves at the weekly weigh ins and group discussions , it added			1
researchers from universities including @entity27 and @entity28 in the @entity29 and @entity30 in @entity31 , looked at how members of a @entity34 group behaved			1
in the early stages new members would turn up feeling fat and with a lack of confidence about how they would progress so they sought support from others in the group			2
this leads to groups becoming mutually supportive , cheering each other on when they drop a pound or two on the scales and sharing ideas and tips about weight loss regimes			1
but as an individual gets closer to the target they had originally been set , they gain in confidence and become more competitive			0
they no longer feel they need the support of others as much as they used to , said the study for the @entity61 , and so become distant and reclusive			0
as a result , they even become secretive and selfish , keeping any new weight loss advice or strategies to themselves and not passing them on			1
but this could become a problem as many people with an addiction , not just regarding weight , often give up if they do not get the support of others in a similar situation			0
the bonding and friendship that helped the overweight members at the beginning slowly dissolves as individuals begin to see the pounds drop off , said the report			2
the authors wrote : ' when consumers start working toward a goal , they often feel uncertain about how to achieve the goal and see others at a similar stage as friends			0
' they pass on helpful tips and cheer each other on			0
' as individuals lost weight and grew in confidence , they believed they do n't need support from others and become distant it added : ' but once the goal is in sight , consumers feel more certain and believe they do n't need support from others , so they become distant and keep useful information to themselves			0
' in the @entity34 group studied by the researchers , every single member interviewed at the beginning talked of how they helped and got help from others			2
but by the advanced stage of their weight loss regimes , only 42 per cent said they were helping other members and 79 per cent said they were reluctant to share information			1
this can present a problem not just in @entity34 but any group that relies of mutual support , including @entity116 and other addiction - based organisations			1
the authors of the report wrote : ' as consumers move from the early stages of pursuing a goal to a more advanced stage , they change from being friendly to decidedly distant			2
' and the more consumers distance themselves from others with similar goals , the more likely they are to feel disengaged and even give up on their goals entirely			0
