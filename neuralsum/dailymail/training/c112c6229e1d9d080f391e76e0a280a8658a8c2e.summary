women keen to increase their bust size but who despair at the £ 5,000 cost of a surgery may have an alternative solution			1
one company is offering a non-invasive breast enlargement treatment for a tenth of the cost - and it boasts impressive results			1
the pain - free treatment - delivered via a machine called the wonderlift - claims to leave clients with a bust size of up to two times larger			1
the machine is a suction pump device which claims to improve the elasticity of skin tissue and shape and firm the breast			1
it just feels like suction really ' the machine promises to firm , lift and tone - and comes in at £ 50 per treatment during treatment , the suction is followed by vibration massage to stimulate the breast regrowth , low frequency current to stimulate the blood and lymph circulation and prevent hyperplasia of mammary glands ( abnormal cell development ) , and finally low - level light therapy intended to assist with skin elasticity , smoothness , rejuvenation , and spot and freckle removal			1
@entity45 's founder @entity44 says : ' the way we work is consumer led			1
i ask my clients what they 're looking for and we deliver it			0
‘ after 12 week course , plus six follow up treatments , results should last up to two years			1
’ appearing on @entity57 's @entity56 , a young woman named @entity59 tried out the breast enlarger			2
she said : ' it 's quite comfortable			0
it just feels like suction really			2
' i wanted to try this treatment because i ’ve been for surgery consultations but i ’m cautious of going under knife			1
' i ’ve had three treatments so far and think my breasts look fuller and feel firmer , ' she said			0
though @entity70 and @entity71 said they ' have n’t spotted major difference '			0
journalist @entity74 , who for the last 11 years has been known for his work around cosmetic surgery , dentistry and beauty , said on this morning : ' i think it ’s a good treatment , but after the first treatment people should see some results , though it is important to follow up and have two to three treatments within the first week			1
@entity59 : ' i 've had three treatments so far and think my breasts look fuller and feel firmer ' ' you do have to have the time to go and have these treatments			0
' ms @entity44 has just sold machines to salons and clinics in @entity89 , nationwide and even @entity90 where practitioners are being trained to use them			1
she has priced the treatment at £ 50 , but a course of 12 is recommended , which she offers to clients for £ 500			1
the same machine , she says , can perform a bottom lift and enhancement via the same technologies it uses to firm and enlarge breasts			1
' it can reduce cellulite and lift the glutes up			2
' although her background is not in the beauty industry , @entity106 's passion for the industry led to her opening @entity112 in @entity113 in 2008 - a decision she says she has never regreted			2
muscle re-education is the process of lengthening or shortening muscles			0
the procedure sends a current to lift and re-educate muscles			2
the current stimulates @entity122 ( @entity122 ) , a nucleotide that can accumulate in the muscles themselves			0
the beautician later expanded her reach and won an award for one of her innovative treatments			0
' i partnered with @entity131 as an exclusive @entity133 distributor in 2011 and won @entity134 for @entity131 @entity133 by @entity135 , then my salon was awarded @entity137 in @entity113 2012 - 2013			2
' i came across non-surgical breast enhancing last year in the @entity139 when the @entity141 implants had much media coverage and decided that i would like to launch this within the @entity133 and worldwide			0
' the treatment has been around for long time , it 's similar to cupping - but with the added benefits of following therapies for maximum results			1
' vacuum suction is used to manipulate fat tissue , which is mainly what breasts are made up of			0
the intense suction will also assist with pectoral muscle contraction which is what provides the breast area with shape			2
when a muscle lengthens or shortens , the skin lifts and firms			0
vacuum suction also helps to increase blood circulation thus eliminating toxins through the lymph			0
the machine also employs so - called micro current therapy which promises to stimulate regeneration of nerves and soft tissue			0
benefits of the micro current according to @entity106 include improved muscle tone , muscle re-education , lifting , improved blood circulation , aided lymphatic drainage and increased collagen and elastin production			0
