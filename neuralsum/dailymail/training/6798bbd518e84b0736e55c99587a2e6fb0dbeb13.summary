@entity1 chairman @entity0 has committed to funding independent research into head injuries in the sport amid growing concerns over an alarmingly high incidence of dementia among former professional players			1
@entity0 has met the family of former @entity11 striker @entity10 — who died in 2002 aged 59 from early on - set dementia which a coroner found was caused by heading footballs — and he apologised for the @entity1 ’s and @entity17 ’s failure to deliver promised research while providing assurances more will be done to tackle the problem			2
‘ it was reassuring to hear mr @entity0 taking this issue so seriously , ’ said @entity22 ’s widow @entity21 , who is leading the ‘ justice for @entity10 ’ campaign calling for stricter concussion measures			1
‘ he assured us more would be done in the future to understand the extent of this issue and protect future generations			0
’ head on : @entity34 clashes with @entity35 during @entity11 's encounter with @entity37 last week the @entity1 ’s head of medical services dr @entity38 told @entity40 that football will face a ‘ tsunami ’ of legal claims if concussion protocols continue to be ignored — with a string of high - profile incidents during this summer ’s @entity45 and last season ’s @entity47 ’s @entity46 serving to highlight the issue			1
‘ we ’re not even counting ( head injuries ) properly yet , ’ admitted @entity38			1
‘ we want robust research that gives us some idea of what ’s going on			2
‘ the @entity1 should not run the research			2
we need to present ourselves to a big academic body and say “ help us formulate some research which will give us some answers as to what happens on a football field ”			0
out cold : @entity34 lies on the field after a collision as teammates @entity65 and @entity67 look on this week it emerged that as many as six of @entity72 ’s 1957 @entity71 winning side may have died suffering from dementia while the @entity74 has also been inundated with calls and letters from families of ex-professionals with the disease			0
in june , professor @entity80 , a world - leading neuropathologist who accompanied @entity10 ’s family to @entity83 to meet @entity0 last week , re-examined the former @entity86 striker ’s brain and confirmed he died from chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity88 ) — a form of dementia caused by repeated head injuries and found in former boxers , american footballers and rugby players			1
‘ this is potentially a significant public health issue and needs to be treated as such , ’ said @entity80			0
floored : @entity96 was concussed against @entity97 in november after clashing with @entity98 on saturday , @entity86 announced they will dedicate a home game to @entity22 in a bid to help raise awareness of head injuries in football while a picture of the club ’s record scorer will be displayed on the big screen at the @entity108 in the ninth minute of every home game this season			1
while reassured by @entity86 and the @entity1 response , @entity10 ’s family have been angered by a contradictory interview given by @entity17 chairman @entity113 on wednesday			0
in the talksport interview @entity113 claimed an unpublished study from 2002 — which the @entity1 insist was never completed — showed ‘ no causal link ’ between head injuries in football and dementia			1
but while denying a link exists , @entity113 added that professional footballers ‘ know the risks ’ and pointed to boxers continuing to box despite tragic cases			0
@entity113 ’s comments were branded ‘ irresponsible ’ and ‘ ill - informed ’ by experts			0
@entity40 has also learned that @entity37 defender @entity34 , who was knocked unconscious against @entity11 during the @entity45 but allowed to play on , has suffered complications from the injury and was last week knocked out again playing for his club @entity132 in @entity133 .			0
