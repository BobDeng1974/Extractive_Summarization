' @entity59 prices hit a record level after rising 25 per cent in that month			2
' the price of maize in @entity63 , where people spend over half of their income on food , more than doubled between april and july			2
' @entity68 faced a 27 per cent hike in wheat prices during those three months and over the last year , maize prices soared by 174 per cent in @entity30			1
' the @entity48 's report blamed increasing international oil prices , adverse weather conditions , @entity76 's strong demand for food imports , and the persistent @entity79 financial crisis for the sharp hike in prices			1

the @entity20 said the bank was the @entity16 's top player in food speculation and is the only @entity16 bank that has any real presence in commodities trading			2
@entity148 has sold off its commodities division and @entity150 is involved primarily in metal markets rather than food			0

' in a report from september last year , the @entity13 said that it was not just natural causes , such as weather , that was prompting the food crisis and blamed banks on sparking the hike in prices			2
it said : ' many have argued that the huge increase in financial participation in commodity derivative markets has played a central role , fuelling price inflation and increasing price volatility			0
' ' the huge growth of financial speculation has led to prices no longer being driven by supply and demand for food , but by the sentiments of financial speculators and the performance of their other investments			2
it said the bank 's role in speculation has : ' created huge inflationary pressure in the market , forcing food prices up , increased herding and price volatility , caused the prices of unrelated commodities to move together			1

the report said : ' clear , hard rules are required to control financial speculation and to help prevent another global food crisis			0

' @entity289 , director of the @entity13 , called on the government to intervene : ' treasury ministers repeatedly cite the high price of commodities , which includes food , as one of the reasons people in the @entity16 are facing such hard times			2
' but what the @entity286 does not seem to have grasped is that @entity300 can take easy , painless action to tackle financial speculation , one of the major drivers of high food prices			1
' if @entity300 wants to ease the burden of @entity16 ’s economic woes on ordinary families , and at the same time safeguard the world ’s poorest people from the impact of soaring prices , he should put his weight behind effective market regulation			1

as well as driving up standards and putting customers first , he asks him to demonstrate leadership and establish the @entity325 as a credible voice			0
