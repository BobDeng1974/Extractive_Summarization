by @entity0 last updated at 8:07 am on 8th december 2011 benchmarks : @entity2 , the health secretary , wants @entity5 doctors and hospitals to be graded @entity2 was yesterday accused of creating a ‘ recipe for chaos ’ after introducing more than 60 performance goals despite a previous promise to scrap targets			2
the health secretary unveiled a series of benchmarks - designed to save more than 10,000 lives , and that he claims will measure whether patient care is improving by covering a range of treatments across the @entity5			1
when mr @entity2 took over as health secretary last year he promised to ‘ free ’ the @entity5 from unnecessary targets to enable doctors to concentrate more on patient care			2
he abolished a series of goals brought in by @entity25 , including the four - hour wait in @entity27			1
and he has insisted that his new measures are different as they focus on patient results			1
in a speech at @entity31 in @entity32 yesterday , mr @entity2 promised to ‘ dispense with the jargon ’ , adding : ‘ we make it clear that the @entity5 has one ambition and one ambition alone – improving results for patients			1
’ however @entity25 health spokesman @entity40 said : ‘ doctors and nurses will roll their eyes in sheer disbelief at this news			2
this is inept and no way to run the @entity5			2
it ’s a recipe for complexity and chaos when the @entity5 needs to be allowed to get on with the job			2
’ figures on hospital death rates , the performances of gps and surgeons and patients ’ experiences will be published as part of the @entity60			1
the government 's reforms of the @entity5 " continue to cause chaos " on the ground , doctors leaders said today			2
the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , which opposes the @entity67 in its entirety , said changes taking place now before legislation has even been passed are " chaotic and poorly co-ordinated "			2
groups of @entity54 have been told they must form groups to determine how the @entity5 budget is spent but , according to the @entity66 , they are being told they are too small			2
dr @entity76 , chairman of the @entity66 , said : ' there has been a growing level of unease about how the reforms are panning out - we hear repeated concerns from doctors about mounting chaos on the ground			1
' for example , clinical commissioning groups ( @entity86 ) , that had initially been told they 'd have freedom to form to suit their local communities , are now being told they 're too small and have to re-form			2
' people are still unclear how primary care will be managed as we do n't yet know where staff currently working in primary care trust ' clusters ' will eventually be based or if they 'll have jobs at all			2
' even at this stage , there are still unanswered questions about what statutory functions some bodies will have , making planning very difficult			2
' guidance is being issued that is overly restrictive and more and more bureaucracy is being created to try to deal with issues which should have been dealt with at the beginning			2
' a huge amount of time , energy , money and commitment has been wasted because of a lack of a clear plan from the outset			2
' the sixty indicators will replace the former target - led system and will include a focus on improving cancer survival and a zero - tolerance approach to hospital - acquired infections such as @entity121			1
the plans are designed to ensure patients are treated with dignity by measuring the ‘ responsiveness ’ of staff to patient needs			2
they aim to improve women ’s and families ’ experiences of maternity services , increase the number of people who can access an @entity5 dentist and help older people recover independence after illness			2
under the plans , fewer people with long - term conditions like asthma and diabetes will be treated in hospitals , and patients undergoing hip and knee operations will receive better care			1
an indicator on carers who look after sick and elderly relatives is also included			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ we have to clear the decks and be clear this is what we are focusing on			0
‘ people say in three and a half years ’ time , in 2015 , at the next election , how will we know whether you ’ve succeeded or not ? the answer is , “ have the outcomes improved ? ” ‘ it will be my failure if we have n’t improved them and the @entity5 should feel that it has not succeeded , that is what we are setting out to do			0
’ the government will publish details of the current performance for each of the sixty benchmarks next week			1
national targets from improvement will then be set out by the time of the next election			0
today , the government will publish for the first time data comparing patients ' experiences at individual @entity54 ' surgeries , including recovery times			0
it is hoped that revealing the information will force up standards by allowing patients to choose to avoid poorly performing doctors or institutions			0
where performance falls below minimum requirements the @entity188 will intervene to drive up quality , although how this will work in practice is unclear			0
the aim of the plan is also to move away from a focus on targets , such as those for waiting times introduced under @entity25			1
however , patients will still have the right to prompt treatment within 18 weeks of referral by their gp as set out in the @entity203			0
held to account : nurses and other @entity5 staff will be judged against nearly 60 tough new goals designed to save more than 20,000 lives a year mr @entity2 hopes the framework will also provide reassurance to parliamentarians about the accountability of the health secretary for the @entity5			0
there have been concerns that the @entity67 , currently going through the @entity216 , dramatically weakens accountability of the secretary of state			0
mr @entity2 also hopes the plan will provide a much greater level of @entity5 accountability by allowing better comparison with other health systems around the world			0
the @entity5 has been criticised for lagging behind other countries in areas such as cancer survival			1
ministers will be expected hold the health service to account on delivering increasing improvements across all areas in the new framework			0
where performance falls below minimum requirements they will intervene to drive up quality , although how this will work in practice is as yet unclear			0
the framework will also draw on existing information collected about the @entity5 to reduce the potential for ' administrative burden '			0
