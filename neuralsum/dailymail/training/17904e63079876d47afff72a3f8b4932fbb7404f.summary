by @entity0 published : 08:38 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:34 est , 3 february 2014 @entity4 ’s woolly mammoth , giant ground sloths and sabre - tooth tigers were wiped out by a devastating comet 12,900 years ago			1
this is according to a controversial study by @entity10 professor @entity10 which suggests that an ancient cosmic impact triggered a vicious cold snap			0
now a research team from @entity14 , @entity14 , claims to have further evidence to back up professor @entity18 's 2007 ‘ @entity17 impact theory ’			2
scientists from @entity14 , @entity14 , found nanodiamonds around rock sediment that formed during the @entity22 12.900 years ago			1
in these images nanodiamond textures in the sediment are shown using a high - resolution transmission electron microscope the @entity17 , or the ‘ @entity22 ’ , saw a rapid return to glacial conditions in the higher latitudes of the @entity30 between 12,900 – 11,500 years ago			1
researchers claim that debris thrown into the atmosphere from an impact may have tipped the @entity35 into global cooling , wiping out megafauna along with native cultures such as the @entity40 people			0
the theory is partly based on the presence of nanodiamonds along @entity44 in the @entity45 , which is one type of material that could result from an extra-terrestrial collision			1
@entity4 's woolly mammoth , giant ground sloths and sabre - tooth tigers are thought to have been wiped out by a devastating comet 12,900 years ago the research team re-examined the distribution of nanodiamonds in @entity44 ’s geological record to see if they could reproduce the original study ’s evidence			1
‘ we were able to replicate some of their results and we did find nanodiamonds right at the @entity62 , ’ said @entity58 , an associate professor the @entity14			2
researchers analysed 49 sediment samples representing different time periods and environmental changes			1
they identified high levels of nanodiamonds immediately below and just above @entity17 deposits and in late - @entity70 near - surface deposits			2
the research team re-examined the distribution of nanodiamonds in @entity44 's geological record to see if they could reproduce the original study 's evidence the excavation at @entity44 shows the paleosol - ancient buried soil ; the dark black layer in the side of the cliff -- that formed during the @entity17 the late @entity70 began at the end of the @entity81 11,700 years ago and continues to the present			1
the researchers believe that the presence of nanodiamonds was not caused by environmental changes , soil formation , cultural activities , or the amount of time in which the landscape was stable			2
they believe whatever process produced the elevated concentrations of nanodiamonds at the onset of the @entity17 sediments may have also been active in recent millennia in @entity44			0
a ‘ recent ’ meteorite impact did occur near @entity44 but scientists are n’t sure exactly when			0
however , they claim this provide compelling evidence that the nanodiamonds were the result of a comet collision			0
the @entity17 comet theory has been criticised for a number of reasons , including suggestions that the human population did n't decline at the time , some scientists believe that the @entity22 was a result of the @entity4 ice sheet breaking apart and flooding the @entity113 with freshwater			2
this , they claim , prevented currents taking warmer water north , which caused a colder climate			0
a separate study last year found further evidence that a cosmic impact 12,900 years ago could have led to the demise of the ‘ @entity40 ’ people of @entity4			1
a layer of platinum from an ice core taken in @entity127 was dated back to the time of a known abrupt climate transition , known as the ' @entity22 ' that led to their demise			0
according to researchers at @entity134 , this provides evidence that a comet tipped the world into its colder phase , making dozens of species extinct			0
researcher @entity141 and @entity134 colleagues , writing in the journal @entity143 , found a 100-fold increase in platinum concentration in ice that is around 12,890 years old .			0

researchers looked for presence of nanodiamonds in @entity45
@entity152 is one type of material that could result from a collision
49 sediment samples representing different time periods were studied
team found nanodiamonds below and just above @entity17 deposits
@entity17 , or the ‘ @entity22 ’ , saw a return to glacial conditions in higher latitudes of the @entity30 12,900 – 11,500 years ago
