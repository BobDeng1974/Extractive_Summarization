by @entity0 published : 10:21 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 11:48 est , 24 september 2013 a mountain climber was left stunned when he reached the summit of @entity4 to see an incredible circular rainbow			2
@entity6 , 33 , had spent four hours scaling the highest peak in @entity8 when he saw the stunning sight			0
he looked over the ridge and saw the @entity11 - the name given to the rare phenomenon			1
ghostly glow : the @entity14 spectre shone around hiker @entity6 at the top of @entity4 @entity14 spectres appear when the sun shines behind a person in a way that causes their shadow to be cast on the upper surfaces of clouds that appear opposite the sun. depth perception is affected by the mist and the resulting optical illusion means the person 's shadow appears magnified			1
light diffracts in the mist surrounding them - causing the rainbow effect			0
@entity14 spectres get their name from the @entity14 , a peak in the @entity37 mountain range in @entity38 where the phenomenon was first identified , and where it is particularly common due to the frequent fogs there - and the popularity of the region among hikers			0
it can only occur when the sun is directly behind the observer 's back , and when the fog behind them is thick enough and contains enough water droplets to make the effect visible			1
shadow man : diffracted light in the mist and a low sun formed the essential conditions for the optical illusion to occur stunned : a retired physics teacher explained to mr @entity6 ( pictured above ) what had made his shadow seem so ethereal this means they are only seen in mists at high altitude when the sun is low - although aeroplanes also often create @entity14 spectres when they fly over sheets of cloud at sun - level			1
in mr @entity6 's case , the sun was behind him and projected his down onto the thick fog , creating the colourful , halo - like mane			2
mr @entity6 , a radio journalist from @entity76 , said a retired physics teacher he met at the top of the mountain when he climbed it this weekend explained to him that he had caused a @entity14 spectre - though only ' when he 'd lifted his jaw from the floor ' , mr @entity6 said			0
' i have never seen one before and may never see another			0
it was definitely a privilege to have witnessed it , ' he said			0
rare treat : mr @entity6 was lucky to see the phenomenon , which can only occur if the conditions are exactly right			1

amateur climber @entity6 sees rare optical illusion in mist
' @entity11 ' caused by light from low sun diffracting around an *object*
observer 's shadow appears magnified and rainbow *emerges* around them
conditions must be perfect for phenomenon to occur
