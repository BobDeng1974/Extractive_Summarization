by @entity0 for the @entity1 eight exotic bee - eater birds have hatched in @entity3 , an extraordinary feat that has only been recorded twice in the last 60 years			1
a colony of the sun - loving birds has established on the @entity8 , the largest ever breeding group seen in the country			1
two colourful adult pairs arrived from southern @entity12 early this summer and between them they have successfully hatched eight chicks			1
eight exotic bee - eater birds have hatched in @entity3 , an extraordinary feat that has only been recorded twice in the last 60 years the birds , which normally spend their summers in the @entity18 , were last recorded breeding in @entity3 in 2002			1
that attempt in @entity21 produced two chicks and was the first for 50 years			2
before that two pairs raised seven young in @entity26 in 1955			2
the birds are expected to leave for southern @entity12 within the week , flying thousands of miles to reach their winter feeding site			1
but they - and other exotic species - could be increasingly seen in the @entity3 as we get warmer summers , experts say			2
the long spell of warm weather this spring and summer has already led to an abundance of migratory animals we would not usually see in the @entity3			2
in july a number of yellow - legged tortoiseshell butterflies were spotted along the east coast , the first time since 1953 the insects had been seen in @entity3			0
the butterflies , which are usually only seen in @entity45 , had been blown in on warm easterly winds			0
it has also been an excellent year for bees , dragonflies and all manner of other warmth - loving insects and birds			1
a colony of the sun - loving birds has established on the @entity8 , the largest ever breeding group seen in the country bee - eaters , with their kaleidoscopic and very colourful plumage , are considered one of the world ’s most beautiful birds , and a very rare visitor to the @entity3			1
the animals , which are related to kingfishers , feed in mid-flight by snatching bees , wasps , flying ants and other stinging insects out of the air			0
the birds perch on telegraph wires and tree branches until they see their prey , then leap into the air and grasp the insect with their beaks			0
they get rid of the insect ’s sting by rubbing it against a hard surface , squeezing the venom out of its body as they do so			0
three chicks fledged from one nest on @entity91 land , in a small valley on the @entity93 , and another five from a second nest			0
an adult bee - eater was first spotted at @entity93 in mid-july by dragonfly survey volunteer @entity96			1
a nest - a burrow in the ground - on the estate was located and a 24 - hour operation to protect the site from egg thieves was launched by the @entity91 , @entity104 and @entity8 naturalists			1
their efforts paid off , with chicks first sighted on august 15			0
the second nest , on nearby farmland , went undiscovered until last week			0
mr @entity96 said of his sighting of the adult bird : ‘ i ’d just come from counting golden - ringed dragonflies at a stream and i thought , “ that bird looks a bit different ! ”			1
bee - eaters , with their kaleidoscopic and very colourful plumage , are considered one of the world 's most beautiful birds , and a very rare visitor to the @entity3 ‘ its flight path seemed almost triangular			1
i did n’t really appreciate the bird until i got home and looked at the photos			0
‘ i ’d always wanted to see a bee - eater in this country but i never thought it would turn out to be a major wildlife event			0
’ more than 3,000 people have come to see the bee - eaters since news of their nesting attempt broke , with part of the site opened to public viewing once the eggs had hatched and the threat from egg collectors had subsided			2
@entity91 wildlife adviser @entity143 said : ‘ bee - eaters are usually faithful to breeding sites so we ’re hoping that they return in 2015 , but this will be dependent on weather and other perils of migration that birds face			2
‘ climate change may well lure other @entity18 birds , and migratory insects , to our shores			0
there are exciting times ahead for @entity3 nature lovers			0
’ @entity159 , site manager at the @entity104 ’s @entity161 reserves on the @entity8 , added : ‘ to have four bee - eaters arrive on the @entity8 , nest safely , and return as 12 is a fantastic result , exceeding all expectations			1
‘ it ’s been hard work but a great pleasure protecting these birds whilst allowing people to enjoy seeing them as well			0
