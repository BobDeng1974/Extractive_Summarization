on monday @entity75 , who was part of @entity219 's ' dream team ' , filed defamation suits in both @entity100 and the @entity77 based on @entity221 and @entity222 ' public statements about the case and he urged prince @entity31 to do the same lawyers : @entity75 slammed his accuser 's lawyers , @entity222 ( left ) and @entity221 ( right ) , for naming him in the lawsuit			1
