militants fighting for @entity1 in @entity2 have released the first images of their terror activities since pledging allegiance to @entity7 leader @entity6			1

the slick photographs carry all the logos and artwork typically seen in official @entity7 releases , suggesting the @entity21 - based militants have taken full control of @entity1 propaganda			1

earlier this year the group 's leader , @entity47 , released a video saying the group had pledged allegiance to @entity7 and would be dropping the name @entity1			1
instead they now refer to themselves as @entity55 , which is commonly translated into @entity57 as the ' @entity58 ' of the @entity41			0
since their @entity7 allegiance video earlier in the year , @entity1 has not released any official propaganda photographs or video footage			1
typically @entity7 and their affiliates release shocking images of mass executions or the brutal enforcement of @entity67 law after similar periods of silence			1
the fact @entity1 have returned with little more than a series of group shots and pastoral scenes is perhaps symptomatic of the group 's rapid decline in influence over the past months			2
influence : the slick photographs carry all the logos and artwork typically seen in official @entity7 releases , suggesting the @entity21 - based militants have taken full control of @entity1 propaganda preparing for war : the fact @entity1 have returned with little more than a series of group shots with amateur weapons is perhaps symptomatic of the group 's rapid decline in influence over the past months this morning @entity10 soldiers retreated from @entity1 's last known stronghold in the country amid concerns the militants had booby - trapped the area before fleeing			1
three pro-government vigilantes were killed in the area by a landmine this morning			0

' the soldiers have retreated to @entity111 because of mines			0
they had been on the road but that made them vulnerable , so they moved to the bush but there are mines planted there ( too ) , ' one soldier , who did not want to be named , revealed			0
the @entity30 forest , a former colonial game reserve , is about 60 miles from the village of @entity125 , from where @entity1 abducted more than 200 secondary school girls a year ago			2

@entity1 controlled an area the size of @entity171 at the start of the year , but have since lost much of that ground after a concerted push by militaries from @entity10 and neighbours @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 in the past two months			2
yet they remain a deadly threat to civilians , as illustrated on friday when they slit the throats of 12 people in northeast @entity10 as the army was trying to evacuate the area around the former @entity1 headquarters of @entity187			2
