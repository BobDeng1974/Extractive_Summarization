@entity0 will play @entity2 's ' dumped ' wife @entity1 in film @entity3 it was seen as a fairytale pairing			1
he was the ailing academic with the debilitating disease who became a world - acclaimed physicist			0
she was the dark - haired beauty who discarded her studies for love , devoting her life to his care			2
so when their 30 - year marriage came to an end , and @entity2 , author of @entity22 , left @entity1 for another woman in 1990 , the public was aghast : he had fallen for one of his nurses			1
now @entity2 ’s love affair and the subsequent public disintegration of his marriage has been portrayed in a £ 25 million film entitled @entity3			1
@entity30 actress @entity0 – best known as the voice of @entity32 in @entity33 , but whose film credits include @entity35 and the romcom @entity37 – plays the discarded wife and @entity39 , of @entity41 fame , plays @entity2			1
during filming , @entity2 and his ex-wife both turned up on set			1
it was a daunting moment			0
@entity0 says : ‘ out of the corner of one eye i saw @entity1 and her new husband and out of the other eye i saw @entity2			1
it was probably one of the most intimidating moments of my life			0
it must have been so bizarre for them to watch us playing them			2
it certainly felt awkward for me			0
’ @entity2 and @entity1 watched a sequence during which @entity0 and @entity39 danced together			1
after the director yelled ‘ cut ’ , @entity2 – who communicates through a computer - based speech generator – asked : ‘ would you ask @entity0 if she will come and give me a kiss ? ’ for 31 - year - old @entity0 , that moment was a revelation			1
‘ it shows his rather flirtatious nature and this amazing capacity he has not to take himself too seriously , ’ she explains			2
@entity0 says : ‘ i met @entity1 at the @entity81 home she shares with her husband @entity82			1
‘ @entity1 told me she always felt that @entity2 ’s priority had been physics rather than her			1
she would even describe physics as his mistress , his one true love			2
she said she used to joke with him , saying , “ you are cheating on me with science			0
” wedding day : @entity2 and @entity1 , left , and right , @entity91 and @entity39 playing them in the 2014 film ‘ it is always difficult for a couple where , as happened here , one person becomes very famous			1
‘ when they divorced , @entity1 was lost			2
she had given up so many of her own academic and intellectual pursuits in order to look after this man – although it was something she wanted to do – but she had become so fused with him that , when they were no longer together , she did n’t even know who she was			0
’ the film , for which @entity106 and @entity39 are tipped for @entity108 nominations , tells how @entity2 , who has motor neurone disease and is confined to a wheelchair , met his wife - to - be at @entity81 , and how she coaxed him out of a profound depression and fought against doctors who told the then 21 - year - old he would die within two years			1
she put her own academic ambitions aside to support her husband while he became a ‘ superstar ’ in the scientific world , explaining complex theories such as the @entity120 , black holes and multi-dimensional space in layman ’s language in his best - selling books			2
yet while he was feted in public , at home he relied utterly upon his wife			0
the film is based on @entity1 ’s memoir travelling to @entity130 : my life with @entity2 , in which she recalls : ‘ he required my help with the minutiae of every personal need , dressing and bathing , as well as with larger movements			1
i felt like that traveller who had fallen into a black hole : stretched , tugged and pulled like a piece of spaghetti by uncontrollable forces			0
’ to prepare for her role , @entity0 also watched endless video clips of the @entity148 during their marriage			2
‘ i was struck by the precision of @entity1 ’s care for him			1
she took care of everything , down to the angle of the glass she would hold to his mouth			0
‘ it had to be tipped just so , so that he could drink and the dribble would n’t go all around his mouth			0
she had this instinct and ability to know what was best for him			0
in a way , after she left the academic world herself , he became her field of study			0
‘ that said , @entity1 was someone very special			2
she wrote a thesis on medieval @entity170 poetry during the early days of their marriage			0
' she had a very strong sense of her own identity but she also had extraordinary love and compassion			0
she has a very strong religious faith and part of that faith was about making choices and committing to them			0
‘ when @entity2 was diagnosed with motor neurone disease she thought , “ right , i am going to stand by this person and show him as much love as i can for as long as it takes			1
” ’ @entity0 says she jumped at the role , knowing that @entity1 had made a huge contribution to @entity2 ’s success			1
‘ i read about all these great men in history and there will always be a great woman in the background doing the tedious , less glamorous stuff that keeps it all together			0
' these women should not be invisible			0
