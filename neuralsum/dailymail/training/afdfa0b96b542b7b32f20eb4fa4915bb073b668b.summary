' mr @entity0 said he did not ask for any more details , but made informal enquiries from @entity40 the next day and was told that the programme had been dropped for ' journalistic reasons '			2
he added that he did not ask what allegations against @entity13 were being investigated , and only found out about them almost a year later after he had stood down from the @entity8			0
paedophile : police have described the late @entity16 presenter as one of @entity4 's worst sex offenders ' no knowledge ' : mr @entity0 said that , during his time as director - general of the @entity8 , he never heard any allegations or received any complaints about @entity56 ( pictured ) after @entity13 died , @entity8 journalists for the @entity10 programme spent six weeks investigating allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in @entity63 , south - east @entity64			1
