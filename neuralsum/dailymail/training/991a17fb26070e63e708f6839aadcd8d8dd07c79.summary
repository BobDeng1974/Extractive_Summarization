tragic : @entity49 had been a member of the elite @entity17 police unit which protects @entity18 including the prime minister and the royal family			1
( @entity149 picture ) she said : ' he told me dark thoughts that he had never told anyone			1
' it was hard for me			0

he had just locked it away in a box			0
' he said it had never gone that bad since because he said nothing in life is that important enough to kill yourself over			0
he said it was a selfish thing to do and he was too proud to do it			0
' his close friend detective sergeant @entity165 said @entity49 was upset by ms @entity32 cheating on him			0
in a statement he said : ' in october 2012 he came to see me and told me that he and @entity32 had split up			1
' the reason he told me for the split was that they wanted different things			2
' it was around december 2012 when i was told that the reason for the split was that @entity32 had been seeing someone else			2
this was the first i had heard of anything			0
' he was a very proud person , he did not like to be made a fool of , he committed himself 100 per cent to his relationship with @entity32			2
' the final blow was that she had an affair with someone in his own team			0
' the inquest heard that all the police equipment was checked and accounted for on february 17th , but at 4.55am the following morning he used his swipe card to get back into his station			1
recording a verdict of suicide , coroner @entity191 said : ' he was the consummate professional - he was the person that everybody wanted to work with			1
' everyone knew about his personal problems and wanted to help			0
they gave him a hug			0
he was described in terms of being adored			0
' it seems incredible that this extraordinary person took his own life			0
' he had a lovely family , he had a great job and colleagues that adored him			0
' but his romantic life had gone wrong and he was devastated about that			0
' although the majority of those around him never had any inclination , he had attempted to take his own life in the past and this was because of a romantic relationship that had gone wrong			1
' i heard that in his last relationship he gave unconditional love			2
' he was desperately sad			0
i think having given that unconditional love and that relationship disintegrating and not returning to what he wanted , i think he decided the only way out he saw was to take his life			2
and i think that is what he did			0
' @entity49 ’s mother , who sat next to his father at the inquest , collapsed in tears as the verdict was announced and was hugged by her daughter , @entity49 ’s younger sister			1
a statement from the @entity23 said : ' @entity23 firearms officers undergo rigorous tactical training and regular refresher training			0
' this includes self - awareness training for individuals and supervisors and is further supported by annual health screening			0
' protection officers are also subject to the highest vetting levels as part of the robust selection process			0
' steps are taken to ensure that officers are mentally and physically fit for deployment in this role , including regular re-authorisation processes and an annual re-application process , which requests senior officers support for the continued deployment of that officer based upon their line manager 's recommendation			2
' the police said that @entity49 was up to date with his assessments and that they have no official reports that mr @entity7 had made previous attempts on his life			1
