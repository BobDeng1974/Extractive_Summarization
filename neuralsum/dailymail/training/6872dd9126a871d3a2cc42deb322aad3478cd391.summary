with a new pill that claims to boost female libido set to hit shelves in three years , two women have been at loggerheads on live television debating the pros and cons of such a medical advancement			0
journalists @entity9 and @entity11 appeared on this morning to share their thoughts on @entity20 - known informally as ' female @entity13 ' or ' @entity14 ' - with @entity9 believing no such pill could work on women as it does with men , because for females sex is too dependent on an emotional connection			1
@entity11 , however , said women ' have a responsibility to keep their libidos high ' for their partners , and believes the pill could help save floundering marriages			2
turning to mother - of - four @entity9 - who has said publicly in the past that she would ' rather mop the floor ' than have sex with her husband - @entity46 commented that it would ' solve all your problems '			2
@entity9 retorted that the pill would in fact ' cover up ' the problems , and would not necessarily keep her husband happy , adding : ' would it ? how nice is it for my husband to know that the only reason i 'm leaping into bed with him is because i 've popped a pill ? ' @entity11 , left , said the pill would solve all the marital problems of @entity9 , right , who has said in the past that she would rather ' mop the floor ' than have sex with her husband dr @entity32 added that for a woman to lose her libido is a serious thing , but that the pill - not manufactured by the same pharmaceutical company that make @entity13 - should be considered as an option only by women who are happy in their marraiges and for whom a low libido is their only complaint			1
could this pill save your marriage ? she said : ' i think the pill does have a place among the few women who have lost their libido and would very much like it back , but who are otherwise happy			1
' there are others who have lost their libidos for different reasons - maybe they are unhappy in their marraige or do n't fancy their man anymore - but that 's a different issue			0
' @entity9 said women are more complicated sexually than men , and that the pill would not stimulate females emotionally			0
she said : ' if you 're a man and you want to have sex for the sake of having it , fine , pop a pill and have sex in the mechanical way			0
' but women are different			0
i 'm the type of woman this drug is targeting , and we want to feel desirable and desired : it 's not a chemical thing , it 's an emotional thing			0
' dr @entity32 said that while @entity13 's secondary , mechanical side effect was discovered while creating a pill for angina , the female libido pill works more like an anti-depressant and so does stimulate emotions			1
from left , dr @entity32 , @entity11 , @entity9 , @entity36 and @entity38 discuss ' female @entity13 ' on this morning			1

@entity9 and @entity11 debated pill on this morning
@entity11 said @entity20 pill could save *struggling* marriages
@entity9 said for women sex is too dependent on emotions for pill to work
dr @entity32 says pill is ideal for women otherwise happy in marriage
@entity138 will not solve marital problems if they are *deeper* than low ibido
