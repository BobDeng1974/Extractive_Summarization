new data suggests that only women can reap the benefits of a fruit and veg rich diet eating fruit and vegetables could stop you having a heart attack - but only if you are a woman			1
young females who eat a healthy diet are less likely to develop clogged arteries from a build up of plaque , which can lead to heart attacks or stroke , compared with those who eat a less balanced diet			1
however the same benefit does not apply to men - and scientists do n't know why , saying the phenomenon ' warrants further investigation '			2
the study , comprised of more than 2,500 people in the @entity26 , reinforces the importance of developing healthy eating habits early in life			2
previous research was able to find that middle aged adults who eat a lot of fruit and vegetables are less likely to have heart attacks or strokes , but the effect on young adults is less clear			2
women in their 20s who said they ate between eight and nine servings of fruit and vegetables a day as part of a 2,000 calorie diet were 40 per cent less likely to develop a build up in their arteries called ' plaque ' , or coronary artery calcification			1
this was when compared with those in their 40s who ate only three or four servings a day , whose chance of developing the build up was much higher			0
this trend carried on even after other lifestyle behaviours like smoking , exercise and sugary drink consumption were accounted for			0
the study also took into consideration current eating habits , further demonstrating how dietary patterns affect younger people as well			0
dr @entity65 , of the @entity66 , said : ' several other studies have also suggested a diet high in fruits and vegetables is less protective in men , but we do not have a good biological reason for this lack of association			0
' it is an important question because lifestyle behaviours , such as a heart healthy diet , are the foundation of cardiovascular prevention and we need to know what dietary components are most important			0
' a healthy diet from an early age can help stop development of calcification of the arteries ( pictured ) which can lead to blockages and heart attacks			1

young women who eat fruit are less likely to have clogged arteries
but benefits do n't extend to men , according to @entity26 scientists
arteries can be clogged with calcification from an early age from poor diet
lack of exercise and smoking can also lead to clogged arteries
