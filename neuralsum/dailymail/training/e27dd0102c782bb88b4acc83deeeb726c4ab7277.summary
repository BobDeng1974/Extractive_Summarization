by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 01:09 est , 12 december 2013 roaring criticism : @entity2 , here celebrating scoring @entity4 's second against @entity5 in 2007 , has slammed @entity6 for his @entity8 gaffe @entity2 fears @entity4 ’s ‘ ridiculous and scandalous ’ @entity10 blunder in @entity8 will cost his old club millions of pounds			1
@entity4 beat @entity13 champions @entity12 3 - 2 at the @entity14 on tuesday but did not send on leading scorer @entity15 to chase the one further goal they needed to top @entity18 because manager @entity6 thought his team had to score another two			1
it meant that , rather than finishing ahead of @entity12 on the head - to - head ruling following their 3 - 1 defeat by the @entity23 at the @entity24 in october , @entity4 ended up second			1
they are now almost certain to be paired with one of the heavyweights of @entity13 football in monday ’s draw for the first knockout round			0
‘ it ’s a cock - up , ’ said @entity2 on wednesday			2
‘ it should n’t have happened			2
the whole @entity4 coaching staff have n’t covered themselves in glory here			2
it ’s a poor effort			0
‘ they say the manager is only as good as his backroom staff			0
he must have had six , seven , eight people around him			0
for none of them to know and make him aware of the magnitude another goal would have is ridiculous and scandalous in a way			0
video : watch confused @entity4 boss fail to realise he needed only one more goal @entity49 : you 're 3 - 2 up , you 've got quite a bit of time to get this goal which would have topped the group , were you not tempted to put on ( @entity15 ) @entity15 , your best striker ? @entity55 : i was tempted if we scored the fourth goal of course , that 's why i sent out @entity15 to warm up but also i think that it was a risk to continue with ( @entity64 ) @entity63 , he ca n't play more than 70 minutes			1
‘ even a player does n’t go to the manager and say , “ bring @entity15 on ”			2
’ interviewed by the radio station @entity67 , @entity2 added : ‘ it looks like in the last 16 they are going to face @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 or @entity73			1
‘ @entity4 have a belief they have a chance of winning it but , if they ’d won the group they would have faced @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 or @entity85			2
they ’d have had a bye			0
‘ @entity12 made £ 60 - £ 70million by winning the @entity10			2
going out at the last 16 could cost millions of pounds			0
’ @entity6 ’s lack of awareness was even more embarrassing because the club ’s @entity91 feed pointed out they only needed one more goal to go through as group winners			1
confusion : @entity6 said he was tempted to bring @entity15 on if @entity4 scored the fourth , but they only needed one mishap : @entity6 brought off @entity98 in the closing stages and brought on @entity100 @entity4 could have gone through with another goal , based on their head - to - head record against @entity12 second place : @entity6 said it ' was difficult to score two goals ' with the score at 3 - 2 , but @entity4 only one turnaround : @entity110 wheels away after putting @entity4 3 - 2 ahead in @entity8 having been 2 - 0 down the tweet read : ‘ if @entity4 were to score another and win 4 - 2 , we ’d win the group ! @entity4 fans roaring their team on			1
’ however , @entity110 , scorer of @entity4 ’s third goal , believes they have proved they can beat any team			1
@entity12 were on a record 10 - game winning run in the @entity10 and had conceded just twice in the competition this season			0
‘ we ’ll take anyone in the next round , ’ said @entity110			0
mishap : @entity6 brought off @entity98 in the closing stages and brought on @entity100 ' w a similar incident resulted in @entity4 's relegation in the 1995 - 96 season , with @entity131 in charge at @entity133			1
battling against relegation and playing @entity135 on the final day of the season , @entity4 conceded two own - goals before drawing level through @entity139 and @entity140			1
@entity141 winner @entity131 knew his side needed to do better than @entity143 and @entity144 to survive - so when he got word that @entity146 were beating @entity143 late on he instructed @entity4 to play out time			1
@entity147 was playing keep ball near the corner flag when the recently substituted @entity150 ran out of the tunnel to tell his team - mates otherwise - @entity146 were not winning			0
but it was too late to find a winner , and @entity4 were relegated			0
ball ( below ) left the club three games into the following season in @entity159			0

@entity162 says boss 's gaffe has cost @entity4 a ' bye tie ' against *minnows*
@entity168 left top - scorer on bench despite having *28* minutes to score
a 4 - 2 win would see @entity4 avoid @entity73 and @entity72 in knockout stages
@entity6 waited until 88th minute to make final substitution
@entity176 : ' it was one of the *strangest* substitutions i 've seen in a long time '
@entity181 admits team ' thought it needed to be 5 - 2 '
@entity184 said : ‘ he must know he ca n’t play any @entity187 team and the ones left **—** @entity72 , @entity73 , maybe @entity70 **—** could be *massive* ’
