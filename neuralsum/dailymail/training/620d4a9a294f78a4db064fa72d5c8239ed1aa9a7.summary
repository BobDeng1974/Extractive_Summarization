by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 21 may 2013 a woman who was so embarrassed by her weight she wore @entity6 control pants for eight years has managed to shed a third of her body weight - and finally throw them away for good			1
@entity10 , 29 , was so embarrassed by her size that she even wore spanx tights under her pyjamas in a desperate bid to give her a more shapely silhouette			1
but after embarking on a strict diet , @entity10 has shed an impressive four stone , shrinking from a size 16 to a size eight - and is finally confident enough to throw out the @entity6 knickers			1
@entity10 dropped from 12st 7lbs ( left ) to 8st 7lbs ( right ) , after eight years of wearing spanx day and night even after almost a decade of squeezing into shape control spanx , 5ft 2in @entity10 , from @entity22 , beds , tipped the scales at 12st 7lb - giving her a @entity26 of 32 , making her medically obese			1
@entity10 said : ' i used to feel so frumpy and miserable , i 'd got to a point where i was so miserable about the way i looked i was barely leaving the house			2
' i discovered spanx and then i started wearing them obsessively - i would n't go anywhere without a pair on , hoping that it made me look a bit slimmer			2
' one evening i was sitting at home in my pyjamas , and i still had my control pants on underneath , and i realised how ridiculous the situation had got			1
' the only people who could see me were my parents , but i felt so disgusting that i could n't even sit around in my own living room without feeling uncomfortable			0
' i never dreamed i 'd be able to lose the weight , but 18 months on , i 'm thrilled that i 'm finally the real me			0
' @entity10 spent almost eight years yo - yo dieting , trying dozens of fad diets and religiously wearing her control pants , but failed to shift the pounds			1
@entity10 was so uncomfortable with her body she even wore her spanx under her pajamas ( left ) but now she has dropped the weight ( right ) she has found the confidence to throw the control pants out but when she noticed that a colleague had lost weight with the @entity56 - which initially restricts dieters to limited meals , replacing them with shakes and soups - she decided to give it a go			1
@entity10 said : ' i 'd always been unhappy with my size , and i was badly bullied at school			2
' some girls once started a rumour that i was pregnant			0
it was so humiliating , but i just turned to food for comfort			0
' when i was 21 , i went on a weekend break with my mum to @entity72 , and i packed loads of clothes to go out in			0
but when i came to get changed , i realised how awful i looked , and i could n't bear to go anywhere			0
' my mum went out and bought some tummy - control pants for me , so i felt a bit more comfortable - and from then on , i was hooked			1
' i wore them all the time , to the point where i did n't feel comfortable going anywhere without them			2
' i tired every diet going to lose weight , but i could never stick at them			2
@entity10 says starting the @entity87 diet and losing four stone has got her addicted to healthy eating and she now wants her story to inspire others to change their life ' i 'd manage a few days , or a couple of weeks , and lose a few pounds , but then i 'd cave in and the diet would go out of the window and the spanx would go back on			1
' the worst diet i tried was a lemon , water and cayenne pepper diet that @entity102 was doing - i did n't even last a day			0
' i never thought i 'd manage to stick to a diet , but one of my friends from work lost loads of weight on @entity87			2
' i liked that i had a set diet every day , and i did n't have to worry about counting points or calories , so i gave it a go			0
' i had a one - on - one counsellor from the diet plan too , who helped me keep going when it got tough			0
' but the weight started falling off straight away - and i was hooked on healthy eating ! ' a year and a half after starting the diet , @entity10 now weighs 8st 7lbs - and has finally thrown out the @entity6 pants			1
she added : ' i 've even inspired my dad to start the diet too - he 's lost almost as much as me			0
' i want to let other people out there who are struggling with their weight know that it is possible to change your life - if i can do it , anyone can			0
