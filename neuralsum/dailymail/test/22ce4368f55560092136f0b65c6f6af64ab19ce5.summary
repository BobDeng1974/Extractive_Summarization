@entity1 boss @entity0 has challenged star striker @entity2 to become an @entity4 hero as the @entity6 underdogs face @entity7 in the first full house at @entity9 since 2011			1
rovers rejected a £ 12million bid from @entity12 for @entity13 international @entity2 at the start of the season — a decision that will be vindicated should the 17 - goal striker score the winner in wednesday night 's sixth - round replay and take his side to @entity21			1
‘ someone has got to be the hero for @entity1 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we will need heroes in terms of defending and work - rate , but we also need a match - winner and there is probably no - one better than @entity2			2
hopefully he can step up and have his name in lights			0
’ @entity1 boss @entity0 has said @entity2 ( centre ) can become an @entity9 hero @entity2 goes into the @entity4 replay on the back of scoring in @entity1 's 3 - 0 win over @entity39 rovers were a laughing stock when they were last in the @entity4 quarter - finals in 2013 and only 8,000 turned up at @entity9 to see them lose to @entity44 , but @entity0 said : ‘ there will be an extra 20,000 people in the stadium compared to that game against @entity44			1
' i think it ’s recognition from the supporters who have realised the amount of hard work that ’s gone into what we ’re trying to do , myself and the staff			0
’ @entity1 ’s run is even more impressive because of a restricted squad of 24 players due to breaching @entity62 rules			0
they also have injuries to @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 believes his side will be buoyed by the ' extra 20,000 people ' at @entity9			2

@entity0 hopes @entity2 can fire @entity1 into next round
@entity1 face @entity7 at home after drawing with the @entity76 at @entity77
the @entity6 *outfit* will have their first sell - out *crowd* since 2011
