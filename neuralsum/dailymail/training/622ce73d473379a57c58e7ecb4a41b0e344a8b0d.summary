@entity0 was sir @entity2 's no 2 at @entity3 by @entity4 @entity0 quit as manager of @entity6 on wednesday night after a @entity8 side inspired by @entity9 ended their hope of progressing into the knockout stages of the @entity13			1
@entity14 striker @entity9 ensured already - eliminated @entity8 secured the first @entity13 victory in their history by scoring the opening goal and setting up a second for @entity20 's @entity19 in @entity21			1
@entity6 fought back to score their first goal of the tournament through @entity26 's @entity25 but @entity8 quickly restored their two - goal advantage with a fine effort from @entity29 to leave @entity0 's side bottom of @entity31 sir @entity2 's former no 2 at @entity3 confirmed afterwards his stint in @entity34 was over after three years			1
gone : @entity6 coach @entity0 quit his role after their defeat by @entity8 in @entity21 heated : former @entity3 no 2 @entity0 says he 'll always have @entity6 football in his heart lonely job : @entity0 kicks a water bottle after @entity8 midfielder @entity19 put his side ahead 2 - 0 he said : ' i 've shown my commitment to this project , but i have n't received any new contract offer			1
' it 's been an honour for me to work for @entity6 , i 've fallen in love with the country			2
but you ca n't have a marriage when only one side wants to commit			0
' i waited for them to make an offer , but i have n't received anything , so today i 've come here to say ' thank you ' to those who gave me the opportunity to do this job			0
' i will always have @entity61 football , my players and the fans in my heart			0
' @entity8 did n't want to end their debut @entity13 without a point after narrow losses to @entity69 and @entity70			1
@entity9 had seen a goal wrongly disallowed and also missed several chances in that game so he was relieved to shoot @entity8 ahead after 23 minutes with a left - footed strike outside the area			2
deadlock broken : @entity9 is muted in his celebration after opening the scoring for @entity8 precision : the @entity14 striker put his nation in the lead with a sublime left - footed strike out of reach : @entity6 goalkeeper @entity85 is given no chance as @entity9 's shot goes in off the post finally : @entity9 scored with his 12th shot of the tournament after @entity8 's losses to @entity69 and @entity70 rain on his parade : @entity0 said he had n't been offered a new contract by @entity6 football for once , he was left free by white - shirted defenders and took full advantage with a clinical finish that clipped off the inside of the post			1
@entity6 have been one of the best teams in @entity102 in terms of defensive organisation but toothless up front which cost them in a 1 - 0 defeat against @entity69 when @entity107 scored late on			1
the irony yesterday was that when they tried to push forward seeking the win to take them into the last 16 , @entity109 needlessly gave the ball away and @entity9 reacted quickly to play in @entity19 to score			2
@entity114 finished smartly from six yards after good work from @entity116 down the left to briefly give @entity6 some hope			2
slotted : @entity20 midfielder @entity19 takes his chance to put @entity8 2 - 0 up against @entity6 cool and calm : @entity19 shoots as @entity8 go 2 - 0 up at @entity121 in @entity21 despair : @entity6 's @entity123 covers his face as @entity6 's chances of advancing evaporate but that evaporated 120 seconds later when the overlapping @entity29 fired in his first international goal from a tight angle to atone for an earlier miss he 'd made from @entity9 's through - ball			1
an emotional @entity0 added : ' we pushed ourselves to the limit , mentally and physically and i 'm very , very proud of them			0
despite all our difficulties , we kept pushing and created some good chances , but @entity8 were better today			0
' @entity8 's win was a great source of pride			2
a new nation of just four million people , their real victory was to reach the finals having overcome a war in the 1990s that killed 200,000 people			0
even so , their goal celebrations were subdued as if they realised they should have probably been in the last 16 themselves			0
back in it : @entity6 were given a glimmer of hope for @entity25 finished on the far post broken down : the @entity26 striker scored @entity6 's first goal of the tournament past @entity161 's @entity160 get on with it : @entity116 grabs the ball quickly for the restart as @entity6 chased a victory back of the net : @entity25 's celebration is muted as @entity6 still need to score two goals to progress @entity9 was criticised for wastefulness against @entity70 but he blamed the @entity171 referee @entity170 for @entity8 losing that key game			1
even so , several of their players will have enhanced their reputations in @entity176 including Â£ 15million - rated @entity161 goalkeeper @entity177			0
meanwhile , @entity6 will lament a lack of firewpower up front			0
with a @entity13 record of one win in 12 - against the @entity182 in 1998 - they lack belief to go with their technical ability			0
@entity21 maintained its reputation as the @entity102 venue for goals - four matches there have yielded 21			0
maiden : @entity29 ( right ) blasts his shot into the inside of the far post after a fast break out on a high : @entity197 lifted up as his goal clinches a morale - boosting win for @entity8 as they bow out in @entity102 maiden : @entity202 - based @entity197 celebrates his first goal for @entity8 after a busting run from the back			1

@entity0 quit as @entity6 's coach on after the loss to @entity8
a win for @entity6 would have earned them a place in the last - 16
instead , after the 3 - 1 defeat @entity0 's side finished last in @entity31
@entity8 finished third in the group behind @entity69 and @entity70
@entity0 was sir @entity2 's no 2 at @entity3
he said @entity6 football 's management had not offered him a new contract
@entity9 and @entity19 scored the first two goals for @entity8
@entity6 *pegged* back a goal through @entity26 's @entity229
@entity8 defender @entity29 hit back on the counter within a minute
@entity69 beat @entity70 3 - 2 , with two goals to @entity107 , to top @entity31
