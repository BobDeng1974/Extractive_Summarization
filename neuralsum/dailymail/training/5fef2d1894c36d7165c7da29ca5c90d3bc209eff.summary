parents could one day wave goodbye to the school run and pack their children off in a driverless car , a transport minister has predicted			1
@entity6 said she has a ' vision ' of futuristic vehicles picking children up in the morning and bringing them home at 3.30pm			1
but she warned of the dangers of relying on technology which could be vulnerable to a cyber attack			2
@entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity18 will all host autonomous driving projects that will run for between 18 and 36 months starting from january 2015			1
ministers hope to make @entity23 a world leader in the technology			1
@entity31 has unveiled a computerised ‘ hands - free ’ self - driving bubble car , which has no steering wheel , brake or accelerator pedals , just buttons for start , pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing your route			2
miss @entity6 told mps she wants driverless cars to be seen as ' assisted technology ' and not ' zombie robot taxis '			1
giving evidence to the transport select committee , she said : ' my personal view , i think it 's incredibly exciting because there is an opportunity to use time and capacity more effectively			0
' we are short of capacity in terms of roads in this country , we are all short of time			0
anything we can do to use capacity more intelligently and preserve safety and give people more time is a good thing			0
' she added : ' i have a vision of the school run driverless car where you put your children in and wave them off to school and then they come back at 3.30pm			1
' driverless buses – i know it makes everyone nervous – but anything you can do to make mass vehicles more cost effective would be interesting as well			0
so i think there is huge potential , but we are on an evolution			0

driverless pods will ferry individuals around pedestrianised areas of @entity18			2
@entity26 : the @entity110 project will test automated electric shuttles buses and robotic valet parking			2
@entity25 : the insurance implications of driverless vehicles will be explored by the @entity116 consortium			2
the programme will also look at how cars cope with the city 's challenging terrain and how they are received by the public			0
as part of the trials , @entity18 and @entity27 will share the @entity23 @entity101 programme , which involves @entity125 , @entity126 as well as a number of universities and engineering consultancies			1
they will test self - driving cars on real roads as well as lightweight self - driving pods designed for pedestrianised areas in @entity18			1
it is hoped that testing driverless cars in a real - world environment will help lead to greater levels of understanding of the vehicles and will allow the public to imagine how the cars could fit into everyday life			0
the @entity145 has predicted that within 15 years there will be vehicles taking people and freight across the country without drivers			0
miss @entity6 conceded that there are concerns about the security of web technlogoly which could be targeted by hackers			1
but she added : ' the challenge overall is more about cyber security			0
the more we are all dependent on cyber information to work out where we are to the road network , to have the road networks communicating that there is a particular breakdown and that is a huge challenge across @entity166 and society			0

first major @entity23 trials of technology to start in four towns next month
@entity173 will be held in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity18
transport minister @entity6 cars could one day do the school run
but admits there are concerns about risk of cyber hackers targeting cars
