it 's been a week since androgynous model @entity1 came out as a transgender woman and after a long wait , she 's now opening up about what she describes a ' life - saving ' decision			1
@entity1 , 22 , underwent sexual reassignment surgery earlier this year to transform herself from a man to a woman , a move she 's been planning since the age of 13 , and although her looks have n't changed , her sexual anatomy - at last - has			1
' now i can stand naked in front of a mirror and really enjoy my reflection , ' she told @entity18			2
' and those personal moments are important			2
' ' those personal moments are important ' : @entity21 ( pictured in april ) had been planning her sexual reassignment surgery since the age of 13 , and now that it 's finally done , she can fully enjoy the sight of her naked body born in @entity35 in 1991 , @entity1 - who was born with the male name @entity21 but has since added an ' a ' to feminize it - grew up with her family in @entity30 , and was discovered by a talent scout while she working at @entity32 ; kicking off her highly successful modelling career in 2010			1
in @entity37 , which she says is less ' progressive , ' @entity1 has worked primarily on the male board of her agency @entity40 , whereas in @entity41 , she has been on both male and female boards			1
' i told my men ’s agent [ in @entity46 ] about two weeks before the operation , ' she explains			2
' because i did n’t want anything to stop me			0
' and then recently , i had a meeting with the women ’s [ team ] , and they ’ve been very positive about moving from the men ’s board to the women ’s board , which is amazing			1
it ’s something i guess no one ’s ever done			0
' now a woman : @entity1 ( pictured this month ) has been working as both a male and a female model in @entity41 , but in @entity37 , which she describes as less ' progressive , ' she has been on her agency 's men 's board making moves : ' [ my agency ] has been very positive about moving from the men 's board to the women 's board			1
it 's something i guess no one 's ever done , ' @entity69 says , pictured in 2012 ( left ) and in 2013 ( right ) it is unclear whether or not @entity1 plans to have breast surgery , but for the stunning six - foot - one blonde , her sexual reassignment surgery marks a major milestone is leaving all traces of manhood behind			1
' i felt like my options were either to be a gay boy or a straight boy			0
i did n’t feel that i was gay ' the only time in her life when she embraced being male , she says , was in her pre-teens			0
' i went on sort of a boyhood campaign from age nine to about 13			0
i felt like my options were either to be a gay boy or a straight boy			0
' i did n’t feel that i was gay , so i did n’t know that there were any other options until the age of 13 , when i went online and discovered that there ’s a whole community of trans people out there			0
' chameleon : it is unclear whether the stunning six - foot - one blonde ( left and right ) plans to have breast surgery as part of her transformation high fashion : in 2011 , @entity1 walked the runway during the @entity109 women 's show as part of the @entity111 ( pictured ) despite her roaring success in the fashion industry thus far - she credits designer @entity109 , photographer @entity114 , and former @entity116 editor @entity115 as being particularly supportive - @entity1 says she still faces ' roadblocks ' as a transgender model			1
' particularly when working with cosmetic brands or perfumes or those sort of commercial , corporate things , ' she reveals			0
' it ’s been more difficult			0
they do n’t have any market research , and people in that world are n’t risk takers			0
' you have to prove to them over and over that you are liked by people , you have a skill , and you can sell a product			0
' the big reveal : @entity1 posted this selfie on @entity135 last week with a message to her fans : ' i hope to show that after transition ( a life - saving process ) one can be happy and successful in their new chapter ' it 's not a problem , however , that she is facing with @entity145			1
@entity1 has just bagged herself a role in director @entity148 's upcoming film adaption of @entity149 , playing one of the lead character 's sisters			1
