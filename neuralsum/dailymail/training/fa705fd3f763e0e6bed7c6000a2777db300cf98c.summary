in less than two weeks , @entity1 fans will be queueing up for their popcorn and pic n ’ mix , as they get ready to watch the steamiest @entity6 film in a decade			1
the hotly - anticipated blockbuster is reported to have no less than 12 sex scenes between actors @entity9 and @entity11 , with whips and blindfolds to boot			1
she tells @entity33 about bedroom etiquette and how awkward it is to fake sex to answer these ( and many more ) questions about making love on film , @entity33 spoke to the actress @entity27 , who has taken part in several sex scenes in her movie career			1
@entity27 , 28 , from @entity28 has faked making love on camera in her starring role in the 2014 film @entity46 , had a steamy bedroom scene with a @entity49 model in 2013 ’s @entity50 and was the body double in sex scenes for the @entity32 film @entity31			1
@entity27 talks us through the ins and outs - so to speak – of doing it on camera			1
she reveals all about faking an orgasm face , pulling pranks on your bedroom co-stars and what it ’s like to have several people watching you in the throes of passion			1
claire in a love scene with the actor @entity69 in the 2013 film @entity50 is there an etiquette guide when taking part in a sex scene ? make sure you brush your teeth , be washed and have deodorant on			1
also , i would n’t have anything like cheese and onion crisps beforehand and i ’d check if the guy was allergic to seafood , because in that case i would n’t have something like a prawn salad			2
as a rule , you do n’t use tongues when kissing , but if the director wants it and no one objects , then you will use tongues			2
is it embarrassing ? i used to be a showgirl , which i guess is why i do n’t mind being nude			2
generally , it ’s a closed set , so the people in the room are really only the ones that have to be there , but there are still about six of men and women present			2
there ’s the director , the first assistant director , the producer , the director of photography , possibly a make - up artist and then the sound guy with a massive boom hanging over your head			2
so it ’s a little less embarrassing than the whole crew in there watching			2
@entity27 was a body double in love scenes in @entity32 film skyfall how do you make it less awkward ? you discuss everything before you do it , so nothing comes as a surprise			1
it ’s very choreographed and a lot of the time you rehearse it a bit beforehand , so you know what you ’re doing			2
when i did @entity132 , i had only known the actor for a few hours before we had to do the love scene			1
we actually took ourselves offset and we talked about everything that we were going to do , what we ’d wear , what we would n’t wear , how we ’d kiss , so it does n’t come as a surprise			2
how do you make sure that x-rated parts do n’t get caught on camera ? normally the girls wears pasties ( nipple plasters ) and sometimes a flesh - coloured g - string , or tape over your lower area			0
some men wear a cup , stuck to you with body tape so there are no bits around the back or the side			0
@entity27 reveals that she and @entity69 had a lengthy conversation about what they would do in their sex scene before it took place how do you make sure that you do n’t get carried away ? it ’s not as sensual or intimate as it comes across on screen at all , i mean there ’s a crew in the room			1
there ’s a big furry boom right over your heads to capture every noise and cameras really close up around the sides of the bed or wherever you are			0
it ’s all very different to how it comes across onscreen			0
it comes down to having to feel in the moment and feel the way your character does , of course , in reality you ’re hot and sweaty and uncomfortable but you have to show that you are in the throes of passion			0
how do you make it look like you are enjoying it ? when i did @entity132 , we had to show everyone who was watching that we were completely comfortable with each other and completely in love because our characters had been together for a really long time as boyfriend and girlfriend			1
if the director wants you to feel excited or whatever , you have to show that onscreen , so it just comes down to behaving the way your character would			0
the director tells you what he wants every step of the way , for instance , “ walk through here , sit on this part of the bed , he lies down first , you take his clothes off , touch her face ” and so on			0
you do n’t want any surprises , you want to know the position you will be in at all times			0
the upcoming @entity1 film is expected to have several raunchy love scenes how long does it take to film a love scene ? you do more than one take but you get there in the end			1
i have never done something longer than a day			0
the longest i have done it for is half a day			0
do you do a lot of dieting and exercise to prepare for your body being naked on camera ? as an actress you have to keep yourself pretty trim anyway , so maybe just a few extra sit ups in the days leading up to it			1
as an actress , @entity27 has had to take part in several love scenes are there any tricks to make it look more realistic ? from the side is always a really good angle because you get the silhouette and you can imply a lot from a side angle			1
but there is n’t really any way of getting around being close to each other , you just are			0
there is a make - up artist there to make sure it looks realistic enough , so if they want it to look hot and sweaty then they will spray some oil			0
does anyone ever do pranks ? yes , you have to because you have to lighten the mood as it is quite intense when you ’re in that situation			0
so you do things like drawing smiley faces on your pasties , so that when he takes your bra off , he gets a funny shock , that sort of thing			0
you have to lighten the mood and do a lot of fun with it			0
how do you fake an orgasm face ? well i always ask the director what he sees the character doing , because the director knows a lot about the character			2
but you also know if they are a shy person , or really outgoing , or what the relationship is with this person			0
so is it that character ’s husband , or are they somebody you should n’t be sleeping with , i think that is kind of generally shows how you would portray a climax scene			2
it ’s not like where porn stars just scream and that ’s that , there ’s a lot more to it			0
do you think @entity6 love scenes are creating an idea that is impossible for a person in real life to achieve ? i do n’t think so			1
all of my love scenes have been very normal			1
i do n’t think they have been abnormal ways of intercourse			0
maybe people confuse porn that way because porn is unreal but we do n’t do that			0
the only thing that i would say is that after sex in a film , everyone lies around looking beautiful whereas in real life that does n’t tend to happen			1
@entity27 is currently auditioning and writing her first play , she can be contacted at @entity318			1
