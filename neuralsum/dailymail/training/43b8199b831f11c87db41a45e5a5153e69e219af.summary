but mr @entity6 said : ' it 's a matter one does n't have to discuss			2
i am 84 – every one of us wants to keep on going			0
' i think that he has always had confidence in members of the ( health ) profession and he has the love and care of ( his wife ) @entity38 and members of his family and a few of his friends that go to him from time to time			0
i think he enjoys that and would like to continue			0
' the @entity14 government today said mr @entity2 was in good spirits and making ' steady progress '			1

mr @entity22 said @entity14 should be realistic about the prognosis because of mr @entity2 ’s age			1
‘ in @entity54 , when someone passes away who is very old , people say he or she has gone home			0
i think those are some of the things we should be thinking about , ’ mr @entity22 said			0
it is the fourth time in just over two years that the increasingly frail mr @entity2 has been admitted to hospital			1

spokesman @entity95 later added : ‘ i think we need to be clear that the doctors are attending to @entity2 on a continuous basis			0
they prefer to act on the side of caution , and the moment they felt there was a recurrence of the lung infection , they felt that it warranted immediate hospitalisation given his age and given his history			2
