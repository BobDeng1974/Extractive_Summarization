heavy snowfall and chilling temperatures of -30 ° c do not deter criminals in northern @entity4			1
now police trying to maintain law in the region are struggling on their snowmobiles and want to use reindeer to combat crime on the bleak tundra			1
they say that that mammals are more reliable than their machines and can run fast on deep snow thanks to their adaptable hooves			1
crime fighting reindeer ? police trying to maintain law in the region are struggling on their snowmobiles and want to use reindeer ( pictured ) to combat crime on the bleak tundra some areas of the country ’s @entity27 region are only accessible by reindeer and the @entity31 newspaper has reported that a gang of @entity34 ’s indigenous people are using reindeer to make a speedy getaway from crime scenes , leaving police on snowmobiles in their wake			1
of the 163 crimes reported in the @entity42 municipality in western @entity34 , which were mainly drunken brawls , robberies and ‘ acts of hooliganism , ’ indigenous minorities committed 127 of them			1
@entity4 police chasing the criminals told the newspaper that their snowmobiles can break down and run out of gas – unlike reindeer			1
@entity53 from the region ’s @entity54 said : ‘ of course we have snowmobiles in service , but one should understand that a machine is a machine			2
’ the police say that the furry mammals are more reliable than a snowmobile and are faster on deep snow thanks to their adaptable hooves ( pictured ) which can cut into the ice of the 163 crimes reported in the @entity42 municipality in western @entity34 ( pictured ) which were mainly drunken brawls , robberies and ‘ acts of hooliganism , ’ indigenous minorities committed 127 of them some areas of the country ’s @entity27 region are only accessible by reindeer it 's been reported that a gang of @entity34 ’s indigenous people are using reindeer to make a speedy getaway from crime scenes , leaving police on snowmobiles in their wake			1

creatures can pull a sled which could be used to more easily take criminals back to a poice station			0
while snowobiles have skis and tracks to grip snow , the animals have hooves that adapt according to the seasons			2
in the winter , the pads in their hooves expose the rim so the animals can cut into ice and snow to stop them from slipping			1
reindeer ’s vision may also outperform a snowmobile ’s lights , because the animals can see ultraviolet light			1
‘ a snowmobile can break down or get stuck in the tundra , but the deer will run at all times			0
’ the force believes that the animals will give them an edge in policing the remote area and they have been asking for reindeer recruits for two years			0
@entity103 ’s hooves are unique because they adapt to seasonal weather conditions , @entity116 reported			1
when ground is soft in the summer , the bottoms of the animal ’s hooves act like sponges to provide traction , while the rim of the hoof becomes exposed in the winter			2
this means that they can cut into ice and snow to stop them from slipping			1
they even use them to dig down through hard snow so they can find their favourite food – a lichen known as reindeer moss			2

a stock image of reindeer herders sitting outside a traditional hide tent is shown the vision of reindeer may also outperform a snowmobile ’s lights , because the animals can see ultraviolet light			1
@entity155 reflects up to 90 per cent of uv light and this ability helps the animals to see clearly in dim lighting and landscapes that are largely white , where may objects blend unto the landscape			0
things like fur and urine , for example , show up clearly in ultraviolet light , compared to what humans see			1
a study by @entity170 ( @entity170 ) revealed in 2011 that reindeer can see light with wavelengths as short as 320 nanometres ( nm ) , considerably below the human threshold of 400 nm			2
researchers from the @entity176 discovered that the eyes of reindeer change colour according to the seasons too			0
they wrote : ‘ @entity27 reindeer eyes change in colour through the seasons from gold through to blue to help them better detect predators			0
’ while it may seem funny that policemen could use reindeer like a police car , the country ’s navy already uses animals to enforce rules			2
the @entity194 uses donkeys patrol the country ’s mountain ranges , while the @entity198 employed the help of dolphins to enable them to detect underwater mines			0
the ability to see the sun 's uv rays reflecting off the snow helps reindeer ( pictured ) survive in a winter wonderland invisible to other animals scientists have found that it 's the light of their surroundings , and not @entity214 's nose , which helps guide reindeer in the @entity27			2
the ability to see the sun 's uv rays reflecting off the snow helps reindeer survive in a winter wonderland invisible to other animals , according to research			2
scientists have learned that the animals ' special eyesight allows them to spot hidden predators , such as wolves , and find vital winter food sources			0
human eyes block off ultraviolet light and can be damaged by the penetrating rays , resulting in snow blindness			1
professor @entity232 , from @entity170 ( @entity170 ) , said : ' we discovered that reindeer can not only see ultraviolet light but they can also make sense of the image to find food and stay safe			1
' humans and almost all other mammals could never do this as our lenses just do n't let @entity244 through the eye			0
' humans are able to see a rainbow of light wavelengths ranging from around 700 nanometres ( nm ) - corresponding to the colour red - to 400nm ( violet )			0
professor @entity232 's team carried out tests , which showed that reindeer can see wavelengths down to between around 350 and 320nm , taking them to the ultraviolet end of the spectrum			0
during the arctic winter , when the sun barely rises in the middle of the day , sunlight reaching the ground is scattered so that most of it is blue or in the form of uv rays			0
in addition , snow reflects up to 90 per cent of the uv light that falls on it			0
the ' supersight ' of reindeer enables the creatures to exploit these conditions to their advantage			0
' when we used cameras that could pick up uv , we noticed that there are some very important things that absorb uv light and therefore appear black , contrasting strongly with the snow , ' professor @entity232 said			0
' this includes urine - a sign of predators or competitors , lichens - a major food source in winter , and fur , making predators such as wolves very easy to see despite being camouflaged to other animals that ca n't see @entity244			0

@entity34 ’s indigenous people are using reindeer to make a speedy getaway from crime scenes , a @entity4 newspaper has reported
police want to swap snowmobiles for reindeer as they *'re* more reliable
@entity103 can *sprint* on snow using their adaptable hooves that cut into ice
creatures can also see ultraviolet light to better race in snowy weather
