@entity0 , 22 , who was born without a womb , had been receiving ivf treatment after the transplant in august 2011 a woman who was the first to have a successful womb transplant from a dead donor has had her pregnancy terminated after the embryo showed no heartbeat , doctors in @entity5 have said			1
@entity0 , 22 , who was born without a womb , had been receiving in vitro fertilisation ( @entity15 ) treatment after the transplant in august 2011			1
her pregnancy was announced in april			1
but in a statement released today by @entity19 in @entity5 's @entity21 city of @entity22 , it read : ' @entity0 's pregnancy was terminated after her end of eight weeks examination showed no embryo heartbeat			1
' the general health status of the patient is fine			0
' @entity15 will be continued when she is ready , in appropriate conditions			0
' thousands of @entity32 women born without a womb were given hope if the breakthrough treatment succeeded			1
but some @entity32 experts , including @entity37 , claim that a pregnancy could cause potentially fatal complications			1
the baby would have to be born by caesarean , which carries the risks of surgery			1
prof @entity44 performed the pioneering transplant on 22 - year - old @entity0 in august 2011			1
prof @entity44 , from @entity19 in @entity22 , @entity5 , also revealed three more women were to undergo transplants at his clinic , providing mrs @entity0 has a healthy baby			1
mrs @entity0 , who is married to husband @entity50 , said at the time of the transplant : ‘ if i had a magic wand , i would want to be pregnant now			1
i just want to hold my baby in my arms , to be a mother			0
’ one in every 5,000 women globally is born without a womb , while thousands more have the organ removed due to cancer or other diseases , leaving them unable to get pregnant			1
tv presenter @entity63 revealed in 2009 that she had undergone a hysterectomy to stop her agonising periods			0
@entity66 already has two children			0
however , many women are childless when they have the drastic surgery			0
those in favour of womb transplants argue it is the only way to meet the desperate desire of many of these women to ‘ carry ’ their own baby			2
this need can not be met if they use another woman as a surrogate , a controversial process that is strictly regulated in the @entity32 and illegal in some countries , including @entity83 and @entity84			0
artificial selection : mrs @entity0 had eight embryos frozen before her treatment in 2011 many @entity32 couples end up travelling to @entity89 , where clinics hire out women as surrogates			1
however , this is fraught with legal issues			0
for example , couples whose surrogate children are born abroad have to go to court in the @entity32 to ‘ prove ’ they are the legal parents			2
adoption does not give a woman the chance to have a child who is genetically her own and , again , there is a strict vetting procedure			0
surgeon @entity105 , a consultant at @entity106 , has spent more than 15 years researching the possibility of pregnancy among women who have had womb transplants			1
last year he revealed his team had achieved the first successful pregnancy in a rabbit with a transplanted uterus , although the animal went on to miscarry			1
he planned to carry out the procedure on five more rabbits before it is trialled in sheep			0
danger : fertility expert @entity37 says the risks are not worth taking			0
surrogacy is an alternative option only then will mr @entity105 approach @entity32 ethics committees for approval to try it on humans			0
women who have lost their wombs to cancer need to have been free of the disease for at least five years before they can be considered for a transplant			0
but womb transplants have been criticised by experts because they are not carried out to ‘ save a life ’			2
risks include rejection of the new womb and potential side effects during pregnancy from the powerful anti-rejection drugs			1
after the first womb transplant , carried out in @entity141 in 2000 , the donated organ ‘ failed ’ after three months because the blood vessels used to connect it were too narrow and became blocked by clots			2
however , prof @entity44 does not doubt womb transplants are worth the risks for thousands of women otherwise unable to have a ‘ normal ’ pregnancy			1
he has previously said : ‘ many people think that womb transplants are n’t necessary because they ’re not lifesaving operations and that women have the option of adoption or surrogacy			2
‘ but we ’ve had applications from women all over the world wanting womb transplants			2
this is absolutely necessary for these women : you just have to ask them to realise this			0
’ a total of 100 women were screened last year by @entity165 in addition to @entity167 , who received her healthy organ from a car - crash victim			2
ten of these have been selected as possible recipients			0
prof @entity44 could have a race on his hands to become the first doctor to achieve a successful pregnancy from a womb transplant			1
@entity178 experts carried out two procedures last year , both involving the world ’s first mother - to - daughter uterus transplants			2
prof @entity44 ’s @entity5 team used wombs from dead donors			0
the scientists and doctors at the @entity190 had received approval to complete ten procedures in total			2
doctors are divided over whether to use living or dead donors			0
some experts are uncomfortable with taking the womb from a living woman when it is not for life - saving reasons			1
with live transplants , there are risks to two living patients			0
however , an organ from a living donor can be a better match .			0

@entity0 was born without a womb and had one transplanted in 2011
she became pregnant after doctors placed an embryo into her womb
