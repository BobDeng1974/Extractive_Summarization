by @entity0 the @entity3 ice sheet is melting at its fastest rate in history , it has been revealed			2
three years of observations from @entity9 ’s @entity8 satellite show that the @entity3 ice sheet is now losing 159 billion tonnes of ice each year – twice as much as when it was last surveyed			2
the polar ice sheets are a major contributor to the rise in global sea levels , and these newly measured losses from @entity17 alone are enough to raise global sea levels by 0.45 mm each year			1
launched in 2010 , @entity8 carries a radar altimeter that can measure the surface height variation of ice in fine detail , allowing scientists to record changes in its volume with unprecedented accuracy			0
cryosat surveys almost all – 96 % – of the @entity3 continent , reaching to within 215 km of the @entity33			0
in addition , it has increased coverage over coastal regions , where today ’s ice losses are concentrated			2
these latest findings by a team of scientists from the @entity43 ’s @entity42 show that the pattern of imbalance continues to be dominated by glaciers thinning in the @entity48 sector of @entity17			1
between 2010 and 2013 , @entity17 , @entity49 and the @entity50 lost 134 , 3 and 23 billion tonnes of ice each year , respectively			1
the average rate of ice thinning in @entity17 has increased compared to previous measurements , and this area ’s yearly loss is now one third more than measured over the five years before @entity8 ’s launch			1
the data collected from 2010 - 2013 was compared to that from 2005 - 2010			0
' we find that ice losses continue to be most pronounced along the fast - flowing ice streams of the @entity48 sector , with thinning rates of 4 - 8 m per year near to the grounding lines – where the ice streams lift up off the land and begin to float out over the ocean – of the @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , ' said dr @entity73 from the @entity74 , @entity43 , and lead author of the study			1
this area has long been identified as the most vulnerable to changes in climate			0
recent assessments say its glaciers may have passed a point of irreversible retreat			1

' thanks to its novel instrument design and to its near - polar orbit , @entity8 allows us to survey coastal and high - latitude regions of @entity17 that were beyond the capability of past altimeter missions , and it seems that these regions are crucial for determining the overall imbalance , ' said prof. @entity110 from the @entity74 , @entity43 , who led the study			2
the losses were most pronounced along the fast - flowing ice streams of the @entity48 sector ( pictured ) , with thinning rates of 4 - 8 m per year near to the grounding lines ¿ where the ice streams lift up off the land and begin to float out over the ocean in particular , newly mapped areas by @entity8 in @entity17 have now brought altimeter observations closer to estimates based on other approaches			1
this area has long been identified as the most vulnerable to changes in climate			0
recent assessments say its glaciers may have passed a point of irreversible retreat			1
' although we are fortunate to now have , in @entity8 , a routine capability to monitor the polar ice sheets , the increased thinning we have detected in @entity17 is a worrying development , ' said professor @entity139			1
vast glaciers in @entity17 seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries , scientists have claimed			1
in a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 feet ( 1.2 to 3.7 metres ) to current sea levels			1
a @entity149 study looking at 40 years of ground , airplane and satellite data of what researchers call ' the weak underbelly of @entity17 ' shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted , crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino - like process			2
two new studies indicate that part of the huge @entity3 ice sheet is starting a slow collapse in an unstoppable way			0
six glaciers , eaten away from below by a warming of sea waters around the frozen continent , were flowing fast into the @entity48 , according to the report based on data from 1992 to 2011 two new studies indicate that part of the huge @entity3 ice sheet is starting a slow collapse in an unstoppable way			2
six glaciers , eaten away from below by a warming of sea waters around the frozen continent , were flowing fast into the @entity48 , according to the report based on data from 1992 to 2011 evidence shows ' a large sector of the @entity3 ice sheet has gone into a state of irreversible retreat ' , says lead author @entity177 of the @entity178 , and @entity149 's @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181			1
' it adds concrete evidence that dramatic changes are under way in this part of our planet			0
' the challenge is to use this evidence to test and improve the predictive skill of climate models			0
' the findings were published in @entity194			0
' we at @entity9 are extremely pleased to see @entity8 achieve yet another one of its primary mission objectives			0
' it is a great testament to the hard work put in by the whole team , who have worked on the mission over the past 10 years , ' said @entity202 , @entity203 .			0
