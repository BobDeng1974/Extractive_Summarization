by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:47 est , 6 december 2013 a major traffic route into a city centre was closed today following warnings of high winds , two years after a man died in the area during similar conditions			1
@entity10 took the decision to shut the road past the @entity14 tower - the tallest building in @entity16 - after predictions that wind speeds in the area could reach 75mph			1
but with pedestrians still allowed access , at around 11am today two people were injured in the area by the gusts - including a woman in her 30s who was knocked unconscious			1
the move follows a recommendation made yesterday by a coroner at the inquest into the death of @entity30 , 35 , who was hit by a lorry that flew through the air in windy conditions in march 2011			1
@entity10 said it was closing the junction - which is said to become a ' man - made wind tunnel ' in storms - at 6am until the winds subside			1
the road is the main route into @entity38 from the south and links the city centre and railways stations to the @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 motorways			0
it is used by thousands of vehicles every morning and its closure is expected to cause widespread traffic chaos in the area			0
in a statement , the council said : ‘ people are being warned to plan ahead to avoid possible major disruption around @entity14 tomorrow morning as roads will be closed due to expected exceptionally - high winds			1
‘ @entity10 will shut the junction where @entity16 's tallest building stands due to the forecasts of high winds of up to 75mph			2
tricky : a pedestrian tries to make their way across the road as they are battered by gale - force winds moving : a cyclist carries his bicycle near @entity14 in @entity38 as the area is battered by high winds ‘ no vehicles or cycles will be allowed along @entity100 , @entity101 or @entity102 from around 6am until wind speeds drop to lower levels			1
a high - sided vehicle diversion at the junction will also be in place from midnight tonight			0
’ the council 's director of development , @entity108 , said : ‘ given the high winds forecast and the known risk caused by @entity14 we will close the roads around the building tomorrow			2
‘ we appreciate the traffic disruption that this will cause , but these are exceptionally strong winds and we have to consider the safety of all road users			0
’ ‘ while we need to take time to examine the coroner 's recommendations we would have had to close the junction tomorrow anyway due to the weather forecast			0
‘ we apologise for the inconvenience and ask people who will be travelling in this area of the city to plan ahead			2
’ a @entity129 spokesman said of the injuries : ‘ we received two calls within minutes of each other this morning at @entity14			2
the first call came in at 10.57am			0
‘ a female in her 30s had been blown over and knocked unconscious			1
we sent a rapid response team and an ambulance to the scene			0
blown over : a woman struggled to stay on her feet while walking across the road near @entity14 ‘ just minutes later we received another call about another person who had suffered injuries at the same place			1
we sent another ambulance and both people have been taken to @entity148			0
’ @entity149 , who witnessed the winds on her way to work , said on @entity152 : ‘ people barely able to stay upright , being flung into the road , mum battling as pushchair is almost blown over			0
’ and @entity156 added : ‘ i 've never seen wind like this before			0
two men in high - viz jackets have just saved a woman from being blown into the road			2
’ dr @entity30 died when the truck was lifted off the road by a gust of wind			1
the driver said the vehicle flew like a hot air balloon			0
the inquest into his death heard how a series of wind - related incidents had been reported at the north end of the tower in the years before the incident			1
the company that owns the building , which was opened in 2007 and dominates the south @entity38 skyline , is planning a range of measures to try to alleviate the problem including large gantries over the road			0
but dr @entity30 's family and the coroner have expressed their frustration at the pace at which this measures are being implemented .			2

@entity10 closes the road past 367ft - tall @entity14 tower
decision followed predictions that wind speeds in area could reach 75mph
it comes after recommendation made by coroner at @entity30 inquest
he was hit by lorry that flew through air in windy conditions in march 2011
two people are injured today , including a woman knocked unconscious
