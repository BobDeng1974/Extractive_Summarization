by @entity0 published : 17:50 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 03:16 est , 2 january 2013 @entity1 : @entity3 actress @entity2 and her new husband @entity4 have already been embroiled in a battle with locals over plans for new gates at her 15th century no doubt she hoped that moving to the countryside would provide her with a peaceful start to her third marriage			1
but @entity2 has already found herself embroiled in a battle with locals over her plans for a set of new wooden gates at her 15th century home in a sleepy hamlet			1
the 37 - year - old actress has lost the fight following objections to her proposals to install the 2metre - high gates ( just over 6ft 6in ) at the £ 1.95million property she moved into just weeks ago			1
miss @entity2 , who has been honey - mooning at the house , has now been forced to withdraw her application to the parish council			1
it is understood she wanted the imposing gates to protect her privacy , but she was accused of trying to impose ‘ suburban ’ values on the home she shares with husband @entity4			1
several of her neighbours attended a meeting in the village hall at which they expressed their concern that the design of the gates was out of character			1
the hamlet – so rural that it does not even have street lights – has become one of @entity3 ’s most exclusive areas because of its picturesque scenery			0
one neighbour said of the plans : ‘ people are very protective of the village			0
they are not the sort to gawp			0
some have said that if she wanted that much privacy she should n’t have bought a house like that			1
’ another added : ‘ it ’s very different from @entity58 and @entity59 here			0
i ’m sure everyone there has these great big gates and i think it ’s probably what @entity2 has been used to , but there ’s no need to come here and do that			1
‘ i do n’t know what to think , quite honestly			0
the gates were totally out of character			2
we are in an area of outstanding national beauty and they just were n’t in keeping with the surrounding area			0
‘ if you put gates up , you are just drawing attention to something			2
if you live normally , no one is going to think a thing			0
’ titanic star @entity85 , who previously lived in @entity58 , has returned from @entity86 permanently to make a home with mr @entity4 , sir @entity88 ’s nephew , who changed his surname by deed poll from @entity91			0
@entity2 's gate : the current gate on @entity2 's 15th century home in a quiet countryside hamlet the property is just a few miles from the home mr @entity4 shared with his ex-wife @entity99 , the daughter of @entity100			1
miss @entity2 has a 12 - year - old daughter @entity101 from her marriage to director @entity103 and a son @entity104 , nine , from her marriage to director @entity106			1
one reason she is said to have moved to the area is because of the standard of local schools			2
the parish council said of the plans : ‘ these gates and adjoining fencing are considered to be a prominent , visually intrusive and incongruous feature more suited to a suburban or urban area than this rural setting			2
’ the council added that while miss @entity2 ’s house is not a listed building , it ‘ should be regarded as a heritage asset ’			1
it went on : ‘ the hamlet lies in a very sensitive , tranquil , unspoilt and rural location			0
security : the 2m high gates that @entity2 has applied for planning permission to erect outside her home ‘ any development should be compatible with its location and reflect local style and vernacular design			1
' the parish council object to the proposed high oak solid gates			2
’ @entity136 were unsure whether the actress would re-apply with a new design for the gates , although one said : ‘ i hope they do n’t try again			2
’ miss @entity2 married last month in @entity86 in a romantic and private ceremony attended by only a handful of family and friends			2
it is thought to have taken place at a resort in the @entity150 mountains in a heated barn with a rather hippyish country - chic vibe			0
the ceremony is understood to have been brief and very simple , with the venue filled with wild flowers in jam jars and pretty coloured lanterns			0
in november the actress received a @entity160 from the @entity161 at @entity162 for services to drama			0
she won a best actress @entity166 for her performance in the 2008 film @entity169 .			0
