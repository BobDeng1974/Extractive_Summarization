an artist has carved out a unique genre for herself with her colourful portraits of celebrity bottoms			2
@entity5 artist @entity4 , 31 , who is based in @entity6 , paints miniature pictures from candid paparazzi shots rather than using glossy magazine images , and has worked her magic on stars including @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
in total she has completed 42 tiny pictures , which are the size of a postage stamp and do n't feature any faces , and cost around $ 90 ( £ 60 )			1
@entity4 explained that she wanted to paint her celebrity subjects while they were relaxed or on holiday - not as they are seen in glamorous campaigns which have been polished and airbrushed			1
in keeping with this approach , @entity4 named each work with just the celebrity 's first name , making each piece more personal			2

' @entity4 added : ' the most powerful marketing tool a celebrity has is his or her public identity , and the face represents that identity			0
' even when we see a famous rear in a magazine , it 's accompanied by the celebrity 's face			0
' my miniature paintings include no faces and some would be very difficult to recognise without the title forcing people to become their own paparazzi			1
' people tell me they feel as though they are looking literally at the ' back of fame ' which is fun to think about			0
