the fault zone expected to generate the next ' big one ' earthquake has gone silent			1
researchers are baffled by the lack of activity at the 1,00km long @entity7 fault which stretches from @entity9 @entity8 to @entity10 in @entity11			1
experts believe the lack of activity could point to a build up of pressure - which could lead to a massive killer quake			1
the @entity7 ( @entity19 ) ' megathrust ' fault is a 1,000 km long dipping fault that stretches from @entity9 @entity8 to @entity25			1
it separates the @entity22 and @entity23 plates			2
new @entity22 plate is created offshore along the @entity22 ridge			0
the @entity22 plate moves toward , and eventually is shoved beneath , the continent ( @entity23 plate )			0
two independent research initiatives have both found the same thing - the sound of silence under the sea			0
the @entity7 earthquake fault zone lies underwater between 40 and 80 miles offshore of the @entity39 coastline			1
earthquake scientists have listening posts along the coast from @entity8 to @entity11 , and have been using ships to drop off and later retrieve ocean bottom seismographs			1
these record for up to a year right on top of the fault zone			2
however , they have detected few signs of the grinding and slipping they expected			0
it is ' a puzzle , ' according to @entity56 geophysics professor @entity55			0
' what is extraordinary is that all of @entity7 is quiet			1
it 's extraordinarily quiet when you compare it to other subduction zones globally , ' @entity55 told the @entity64 pi			0
two teams have been examining the area			0
a joint @entity69 - @entity68 team dropped instruments offshore of @entity8 , while @entity55 's team is in its fourth year of deployments			1
named the @entity74 , it is rotating among subduction zone segments offshore of @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity11			0
more videos available at @entity79 researchers have been using ships to drop off and later retrieve ocean bottom seismographs - but still say the fault remains ' eerily quiet '			1
the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) is an onshore / offshore seismic and geodetic experiment that takes advantage of an @entity88 to study questions ranging from megathrust earthquakes to volcanic arc structure to the formation , deformation and hydration of the @entity22 and @entity96 plates			2
researchers say the area is ' locked '			1
the @entity69 - @entity68 team , which published their research in the @entity101 , wrote : ' the lack of interplate seismicity is interpreted to reflect complete healing and locking of the megathrust over three centuries after the previous great earthquake , ' wrote @entity108 and his co-authors in the @entity101 paper			2
experts say this could cause major problem			0
' if there were low levels of offshore seismicity , then we could say some strain is being released by the smaller events , ' @entity55 said			0
' if it is completely locked , it means it is increasingly storing energy and that has to be released at some point			2
' the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) is an onshore / offshore seismic and geodetic experiment that takes advantage of an @entity88 to study questions ranging from megathrust earthquakes to volcanic arc structure to the formation , deformation and hydration of the @entity22 and @entity96 plates			2
@entity55 described himself as ' very concerned ' and said it is ' imperative ' people in the @entity39 continue to prepare for a big earthquake			0
the last full rip of the @entity7 happened in january 1700			1
the exact date and destructive power was determined from buried forests along the @entity39 coast and an ' orphan tsunami ' that washed ashore in @entity69			0
geologists digging in coastal marshes and offshore canyon bottoms have also found evidence of earlier great earthquakes and tsunamis			0
the inferred timeline of those events gives a recurrence interval between @entity7 megaquakes of roughly every 400 to 600 years , reports the @entity153 .			1

@entity7 ' megathrust ' fault is a 1,000 km long dipping fault
it stretches from @entity9 @entity8 to @entity159
researchers believe fault is ' locked ' and pressure building in it
