by @entity1 reporter published : 11:31 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 11:32 est , 10 may 2013 mystery : historians have spent 150 years debating what finally caused the death of @entity6 historians have debated for decades what medical complications caused the death of legendary @entity10 fighter @entity6 , who was felled by friendly fire from his troops during the @entity13			1
but after 150 years of mystery , a trauma surgeon has revealed that pneumonia was most likely responsible for delivering the death blow to the injured soldier			1
shot three times while returning from scouting enemy lines in the @entity22 wilderness , @entity6 was left badly wounded in the left arm by one of the large bullets the night of may 2 , 1863			1
it took at least two hours to get him to a field hospital as blood gushed from a severed artery and @entity6 was dropped twice in a stretcher before his arm was amputated			1
he died days later , aged just 39			1
but scholars have long questioned whether it was an infection or pneumonia that killed @entity6 , who gained the nickname ' @entity36 ' early in the war and went on to be lionized in the @entity38 and feared in the @entity39 because of his military exploits			1
today , on the 150th anniversary of @entity6 's death , a trauma surgeon with experience on the battlefield in @entity44 and @entity45 has revealed his diagnosis of @entity6 's death after re-investigating the medical record			1
after reviewing the 1860s files and subsequent reports , @entity52 surgeon and professor @entity51 told @entity56 that @entity6 most likely died of pneumonia			1
@entity58 is confirming the original diagnosis given by @entity6 's personal physician , the famed @entity10 doctor @entity60			1
' you would be hard - pressed to find someone more qualified than him for the treatment of this injury and taking care of @entity36 , ' @entity51 said			2
fresh outlook : trauma surgeon @entity51 believes pneumonia was the most likely cause of death of @entity70 after reviewing the medical records 150th anniversary : this tombstone still marks the burial ground of the amputated arm of @entity10 general @entity6 near @entity76 , @entity22 ' i do defer to him in some regard			1
i kind of have to			0
he 's not only the treating physician ; he 's also the only source of information			0
' @entity82 's original medical notes were lost when he was captured by @entity84 soldiers			0
he recreated them from memory three years later for the @entity87			0
pneumonia was common in the @entity13 , becoming the third most fatal disease for soldiers			0
@entity6 is the subject of an annual conference friday at the @entity93 in @entity94 that reviews medical diagnoses of historical figures			2
in the past , researchers have reviewed the deaths of @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity99 , among others			0
@entity58 is a graduate of the @entity104 , where @entity6 was a professor before the @entity13			2
a large statue of @entity6 stands near the campus barracks			2
so , his legacy and death were ingrained in @entity58 's experience as a cadet			0
legend : @entity6 , one of the @entity10 's most legendary fighters , is shown in this painting with his troops at @entity115 on july 21 , 1861 @entity6 was shot by soldiers from the 18th @entity118 regiment in a moment of confusion			1
he had led a surprise attack in the @entity122 in @entity22 , and the @entity123 drove @entity84 forces back about three miles			0
@entity13 historian @entity125 recounts that @entity6 was n't satisfied and rode out at night to review the enemy 's position			2
when he rode back , he was shot by his own soldiers			0
then , being dropped during a frantic nighttime rescue may well have contributed to @entity6 's death , @entity51 found			1
' if he had been dropped and had a pulmonary contusion , or bruise of the lung , it creates an area of the lung that does n't clear secretions real well , and it can be a focus that pneumonia can start in , ' @entity51 said			1
' that 's probably what happened in this particular instance			0
' @entity51 , a @entity143 @entity142 veteran , said pulmonary embolism - a blockage of the major blood vessel in the lung - still occurs in nearly 6 percent of combat casualties in @entity44 and @entity45			2
it is even more common among those who have amputations , as @entity6 did			2
still , the debate will continue over @entity6 's death			2
a painting commemorating the last meeting between general @entity155 and @entity36 , the two confederate leaders of the @entity143 @entity13 dr. @entity157 , an internist who organizes the conference each year , said he differs with @entity58 on the @entity6 case			0
he reviewed the records and said he believes a recurrent pulmonary emboli destroyed @entity6 's lung over time , leading to his death			1
the medical records do n't describe @entity6 coughing , as one would expect with pneumonia , @entity157 said			1
it 's impossible to know for sure what killed @entity6			1
but @entity51 said modern medicine could have saved him			0
@entity6 's doctor did n't have the tools or knowledge to treat the complications after the shooting			0
@entity125 , a former @entity175 historian and professor who wrote @entity6 's biography , said he has been persuaded that sepsis , caused by severe infection , killed @entity6 , due to his chaotic rescue and unsanitary conditions			1
he noted , though , doctors at the time agreed @entity6 had pneumonia			1
' unfortunately , medicine in the mid- 19th century was still in the dark ages , ' he said			0
' obviously , i 'm not overly concerned with how he died			0
i 'm terribly concerned that he died			0
' @entity6 was a pivotal figure and perhaps the most esteemed soldier in the war , @entity125 said			0
he was known for secrecy and speed to execute surprise flank attacks for gen. @entity155 's strategy			0
' he was killed in what may be the high - water mark of the @entity10 , ' @entity125 said			2
' you can make a case that after @entity122 , it 's just a question of time for @entity155			0
