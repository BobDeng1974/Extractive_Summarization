by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:49 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 12:25 est , 3 october 2012 police , health and ambulance services are being secretly privatised by the coalition government , @entity2 claimed today			2
seeking to capitalise on @entity9 ’s speech which aggressively attacked the @entity11 ’s stewardship of public services , the party today stepped up its criticism of private firms being handed multi-million contracts to replace state workers			1
they claim ministers have failed to learn the lessons of bungled contracts and broken promises , seen most recently when private security firm @entity22 failed to deliver thousands of security staff for the @entity24			2
shadow home secretary @entity25 attacked plans to allow private firms to police the streets @entity29 , the shadow health secretary , warned that contracts were being signed this week to take more than 300 community services out of the @entity32 altogether			1
and shadow home secretary @entity25 said @entity2 would limit the privatisation of the police as she seeks to assume the mantle of former conservative home secretary @entity36			1

ms @entity25 claims the @entity42 are no longer the party of @entity36 , the man who , as home secretary , established the @entity46			1
police failings in investigating phone hacking , the @entity50 tragedy and the death of @entity52 during the @entity54 protest demoanstrate the need for a new , more powerful watchdog , @entity25 said today			1

‘ it took too long for the truth to come out about what happened to @entity52 during the @entity54 protest			0
‘ and it took far , far , far too long for the truth to come out about the tragedy and senior police cover up at @entity50			0
but we also need to make sure no one ever , ever again has to fight for the truth for 23 years after losing a loved one or child			0
’ she says @entity2 in power would reverse conservative reforms which have made it easier for private companies to bid for neighbourhood patrols and even detective work , adding : ‘ we do n’t want private companies patrolling the public streets of @entity93			1
’ this is at odds with the ‘ @entity93 policing model ’ , under which the police force is publicly run and takes place with the consent of the public – not imposed from above in a militaristic fashion			2
‘ @entity2 police and crime commissioners will halt this @entity42 rush to the privatisation of our police , ’ she said			2
‘ @entity42 ministers want huge swathes of policing handed over to private companies			1
contract tenders which include neighbourhood patrols , detective investigations and more			0
pushing forces to sign up to massive contracts with a single organisation where value for money is at risk			0
‘ have they learned nothing from the @entity24 ? ’ miss @entity25 admitted that public - private partnerships can be acceptable in areas such as new technology			1
but she warned : ‘ policing by consent means the police need the confidence of the public			2
and the public need to know that policing is in the interests of the community not just the terms of the contract			2
‘ policing in the interests of justice , not just the corporate balance sheet			0
‘ we do n’t want private companies patrolling the public streets of @entity93			1
' we want police officers and @entity143 policing our communities – not private companies putting them under guard			2

' they answered a 999 call as police officers do every single day of the week , not knowing what they will find			0
' they were shot down in a brutal act			0
they showed bravery they and other emergency services take for granted , but that we never must			0
' @entity162 ' funeral was being held in @entity163 today and @entity164 's is being held tomorrow			0
shadow health secretary @entity29 claimed the @entity32 is facing its ' biggest act of privatisation ever seen ' @entity2 today also sought to exploit @entity42 trust on the @entity32 , accusing mr @entity168 of a ‘ great @entity32 carve - up ’			1
data released under @entity172 laws show contracts worth £ 250million for 396 health services across @entity175 , including diagnostic testing , podiatry and adult hearing , are being handed to private firms			1

@entity32 privatisation at a pace and scale never seen before			1
' be warned – @entity168 ’s @entity197 is coming to your community			0
' as we speak , contracts are being signed in the single biggest act of privatisation the @entity32 has ever seen			1
' a third of health trusts said they would not have looked to privatise the services without a new ruling from ministers that they must offer three services from a list of eight to tender			0
mr @entity29 also published details of a bus company taking over non-emergency ambulance services in @entity67 and a @entity218 patient advocacy service being outsourced in @entity219 called for an end to health trusts having to put services out to tender under the @entity224 rules			1
but he was unable to give a clear list of services @entity2 would prevent from being privatised in future and admitted the last government ' let the market in too far '			0
‘ since we were in government the debate has changed about the private sector and it ’s reliability , ’ mr @entity29 said , pointing to @entity22 , the banking crisis and the @entity231 breast implant scandal			1
‘ while you can take some risks in other areas you can not take risks in healthcare			0
