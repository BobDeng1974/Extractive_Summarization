she gets the valuable timepiece out from the display and slowly puts it on seconds before he makes his getaway			0
the jeweller ran after him through the shopping centre and told her colleague to shut the doors and she fled , but did not want to leave the shop with one member of staff so gave up the chase			2

‘ i put the watch on more slowly than i normally would , to keep a hold on it , and even held onto the price tags			2
‘ but as soon as it was done up he just fled			0
i chased him up to the road , then i thought he 's going to have it anyway			2
‘ i nearly had him at the doors , though i do n't know what i would have done			0
‘ it was n't brave , it was a natural instinct			0
