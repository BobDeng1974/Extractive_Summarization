in an era when the retirement of players from international football seems almost mandatory once they reach 30 , how refreshing that some still see the honour of representing their country as the pinnacle			1
at 34 , @entity9 resident @entity8 hardly needs the aggravation of jetting across the @entity11 to pull on the green shirt of @entity13 several times a year			1
the current beneficiaries of his talent , @entity16 , are scarcely likely to be thrilled at the prospect either			1
it ’s not as if @entity8 still harbours a desire to appear at a major international competition - having book - ended his @entity13 career with the 2002 @entity22 and the 2012 @entity23			1
and , with 65 goals and 137 caps to his name , both his scoring and appearance records look safe for some time to come			1
@entity8 is still flourishing on the international stage with the @entity31 frankly , most players in his boots would have grown weary of it all by now			1
when you can count @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 among your former employers , the career ‘ to do ’ list tends to be rather on the small size			1
yet the @entity46 ’s desire to achieve even more remains as strong as ever			1
on friday night , he will attempt to once again do what he does best in a place oh so familiar to him			1
for @entity50 , a professional rivalry between @entity52 and @entity13 wo n’t impinge on his admiration for a player whose club career he launched at @entity56 17 years ago			1
‘ i gave @entity8 his debut , ’ the @entity52 assistant manager recalled yesterday			1
‘ i always believed he could be special			1
even at that age he was sensational and he ’s had a sensational career			1
‘ i ’m delighted for him			1
he ’s a great lad and i remember the day he made his debut at @entity62			1
he was 17 , we brought over his mum and dad and i still remember the emotion in the directors ’ box when he scored the two goals			1
he ’s a fantastic lad , a fantastic player and has had a marvellous career			2
’ @entity50 ’s own career , both as player and manager , saw him brush up against some special emerging talents			2
yet , asked if the teenage @entity8 trumped the lot , there was hardly a shred of doubt in his reply			1
i gave @entity80 his debut as well and he was totally different from @entity8 - just a beast , a great player at that age			1
but @entity8 , technically as a player playing against men , was just fantastic			1
‘ one of the things that ’s impressed me about him is that over the years he has matured			2
he has really become a man , coming from being a kind of @entity89 the lad little @entity91 boy , to quite a serious and respected individual , captaining his country			1
it ’s a fantastic rise			2
he ’ll be relishing this game , going to @entity97 , that ’s for sure			2
’ that ’s an understatement			2
for the 60,000 who will cram in , there are hardly words to describe the sense of anticipation			2
not just a @entity105 qualifier but a joust between two @entity39 nations			2
two former @entity39 managers going head - to - head in the venue where they were revered			2
too many sub-plots and scores to settle from club football to count			2
@entity8 plays for club side @entity16 in the @entity115 which means several transatlantic journies a year there ’s so much to consider , so many colourful strands to it all , that the core business is in danger of being lost			1
but @entity50 offers a reality check to those members of the @entity124 caught up in the euphoria of the upturn we ’ve enjoyed under @entity128 and the misguided notion that @entity13 are somehow there for the taking			2
‘ i do n’t think we ’ve achieved anything yet			2
that ( the positive mood ) has still to be consolidated			2
we can go a long way towards doing that if we get a positive result on friday			1
equally , that can evaporate quickly			2
we have a lot of work to do , a long way to go			2
‘ results like beating @entity143 are incremental			0
it ’s another little step towards the next step and getting a more positive attitude going into each game			0
it gets the players behind the manager and the fans behind the players			0
we are on the right track but it ’s not a done deal yet			0
‘ we have made some progress but it has still to manifest itself in a real positive outcome and that would only be in qualifying - whether it ’s beating @entity13 , drawing with @entity161 , it ’s irrelevant - the only thing that matters is qualifying			0
if we do that , we can say we ’ve improved			0
a feelgood factor has never won anybody anything and , to date , has never seen a team qualify			0
@entity52 have ( mistakenly ) basked in notions of self - worth at various junctures since @entity170 1998 and yet the big stage has remained beyond our reach			1
and yet , for all one bad result could see us deviate badly from the road to @entity170 , there ’s no disputing that since winning in @entity177 there ’s been something in the air			0
‘ we ’re getting ourselves into a position where we may achieve more than recently , but the bottom line is the players have taken on @entity128 ’s work ethic , ’ said @entity50			1
‘ they do n’t come here to be on holiday			0
they come to train and work hard and we go into the games having worked as hard as you can ask any group of players			1
’ @entity8 peels away after scoring for @entity13 against @entity192 last month without labouring the point about how dysfunctional @entity52 had become under @entity195 , there is no disputing @entity128 has overseen a sea change			1
‘ a style had to emerge , ’ @entity50 said			0
‘ we had to have a consistent way of playing			0
we had to work on the same things and not chop and change			0
find a way of playing that suited the players and what ’ s expected of them			0
‘ to some degree we ’ve managed that			0
when we play @entity13 , everyone will expect to see us playing a certain way			0
some days we ’ll play better than others but we are playing consistently in a style that suits the players			0
’ it ’s almost impossible to underplay the importance of a victory for either nation			0
@entity13 ’s draw in @entity217 indirectly winded @entity52 – and rendered our brave defeat in @entity219 nigh on futile			1
by the time we face the world champions again in september , @entity50 fully expects normal service to have been resumed			0
‘ i expect @entity217 to come back steamrolling in the second phase of the group			0
the fact @entity161 also got those three points against them changes it			0
‘ we might be looking at having to beat @entity161 at home , whereas if they had n’t beaten @entity217 a draw might have done us			0
the best way to look at it is that we are playing @entity13 and there are three points up for grabs			0
they are the only three points we can affect			0
’ the familiar personnel on both sides might make friday ’s game feel more like club selects facing each other as opposed to an international qualifier			1
it will be something of a battle but @entity50 feels the winner of the physical contest wo n’t necessarily win the match			0
‘ in modern teams you have to be able to play and mix it			0
the @entity253 and @entity105 in @entity254 are hugely physical competitions			0
these players play in that week in , week out and know the physical as well as the technical challenge it takes			0
‘ the team that manages to play well and be technical within the cauldron that will be created , will be the team which will win			0
the team that keeps their heads will prevail			0

@entity8 is still loving life with the @entity31
he has scored 65 goals in 137 games for his country
he will lead the line against @entity52 in @entity270 on friday
