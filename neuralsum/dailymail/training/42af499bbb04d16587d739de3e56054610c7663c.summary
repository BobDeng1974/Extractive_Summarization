by @entity0 forget feeling guilty over the amount of money you regularly shell out on beauty products - an industry worth a staggering $ 160billion - and consider the fact that financially , it might actually be worth it			2
according to a new compilation of landmark studies which examine the perks of being beautiful , a pretty face will earn you significantly more money over the course of your life - $ 230,000 more according to one estimate - and the dividends start paying early			1
in @entity19 's video , which illustrates the findings , advantages begin flooding during infancy , when we receive more attention from both strangers and our own parents the ' cuter ' we are			0
once we enter the job market , plenty of research exists to support the fact that hiring managers are more likely to consider attractive job applicants compared to unattractive applicants with exactly the same resumes			0
in this case , a boo 2011 paper is cited			0
choose a job in politics and again , your looks could determine your career			0
people can apparently predict election results purely based on a candidate 's appearance , and there exists a well - established link between beauty and electoral success			1
perhaps because , as a 2000 @entity76 journal found , beautiful people are seen as more ' competent , kind and trustworthy			0
' across all fields : better looking politicians have been found to have better election odds ( pictured , president @entity81 ) and even @entity83 players ( pictured , @entity84 ) earn higher if their faces are symmetrical @entity86 in the eye of the beholder ? the methods researchers use to judge attractiveness vary , but many psychologists agree that facial symmetry is the primary determining factor in fact , as far as most professional fields are concerned , employees with above average looks get above average pay across the board			1
in his 2011 book , @entity104 , economist @entity105 - not mentioned in the video - calculated that very attractive people earn an average of $ 230,000 more over the course of a lifetime , compared to those less blessed in the looks department			1
taller people earn more too ; $ 789 more a year per inch to be exact , according to a judge 2003 journal - and taller people tend to be smarter too			1
@entity117 : taller people have also been found to earn more ( left , @entity118 ) and will ' hot convict ' @entity119 ( right ) get a more lenient sentence for his crimes , as many attractive people do ? justice ? when beautiful people end up in court , they can expect smaller fines , and win larger compensations , whichever side of the courtroom they find themselves as for heavier women ; their pay declines as their @entity136 increases , regardless of their career credentials			1
even @entity83 quarterbacks make more cash the more symmetrical their faces are , according to a @entity142 2001 study			2
in his book , mr @entity105 writes that according to his findings , people rated as ' very unattractive ' are : ' significantly and substantially more likely to have committed robbery , theft , or assault than were other youths			2
' but when beautiful people do end up in court , they can expect smaller fines , and win larger compensations , whichever side of the courtroom they find themselves , as the video demonstrates			0
in summary , whether you were lucky enough to be born beautiful , or you spend a fortune to up your attractiveness , being easy - on - the - eyes will almost always pay you back .			0

economist @entity105 calculates that attractive people earn an average of $ 230,000 more in one lifetime
