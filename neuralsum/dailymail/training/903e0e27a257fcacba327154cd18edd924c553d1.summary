by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:56 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 16:09 est , 31 july 2012 it 's a virus that originated in birds , but the newest strain of avian flu has killed 162 harbor seals in @entity7 and scientists warn it could be even more dangerous if it jumps to humans			1
researchers revealed on tuesday that the aquatic mammals , which washed up dead or dying on the shores of @entity13 and northern @entity14 last fall , were infected with the @entity16 strain of influenza			1
the seals suffered horrifying skin lesions , a previously unknown symptom in flu deaths , and pneumonia as a result of a virus that they contracted from @entity27 waterfowl , according to researchers at @entity29			1
even more worrying is the fact that the virus has mutated to develop the ability to infect the cells of mammals -- a first for the avian pathogen			1
new threat : @entity37 killed more than 100 harbour seals in @entity7 last year after jumping from waterfowl the announcement follows the reemergence of swine flu in the @entity43 as four people at a county fair in @entity46 had to be hospitalized after catching the virus from their hogs			1
scientists believe the virus entered the seals ' bodies by infecting the small number of cells with avian receptors that the species carries			1
once inside , the pathogen mutated to infect cells with mammalian receptors -- making it much more potent and allowing for the possibility that the strain could infect humans			1
' whenever you get a virus that spills over from one species into another and causes disease that is a significant concern , ' dr @entity62 , a research fellow at @entity29 's @entity63 , told @entity69			1
' when you get a virus jumping over from distantly - related species like waterfowl to seals , it 's cause for even greater concern			1
' and and when that disease mutates to infect a new kind of receptor and cause disease , it 's even more concerning			2
' researchers say there is no evidence the virus can infect humans now , but they worry about the potential effects of the virulent strain if it is able to mutate further and infect humans			1
deadly : the strain of flu that infected the seals is disturbing because scientists never predicted the virus was mutate from waterfowl to marine mammals unlike the @entity98 ' swine flu ' outbreak in 2009 , which infected millions of people but killed only 0.002 percent , the so - called ' seal flu ' could prove much deadlier			1
however , it looks as though swine flu is back in the @entity43			2
the @entity103 counts 17 cases of the @entity106 strain since 2011			1
the most recent outbreak came at the @entity108 in northern @entity46 when four people were hospitalized for flu - like symptoms			0
all of the cases were people who had handled hogs at the fair barn			0
several of the animals tested positive for the same virus , which has traces of bird flu			1
@entity16 has evolved mutations known to ease transmission and cause more severe symptoms			1
specifically , the virus has the ability to target proteins known as cytokines found in human lungs			1
deadly : scientists are worried because the flu strain appears far deadlier than the @entity98 strain , which kills just 0.002 percent of infected people in 2009 this could cause the immune system to go into overdrive and attack itself , causing tissue damage			1
dr @entity136 , from @entity137 in @entity138 , who led the researchers , said : ' there is a concern that we have a new mammalian - transmissible virus to which humans have n't been exposed yet			1
it 's a combination we have n't seen in disease before			0
' the strain is closely related to one that has been circulating in @entity27 birds since 2002			2
but unlike the bird strain , it has adapted to living in mammals			2
the warning from scientists is published in the online journal of the @entity156 , @entity157			0
outbreak : flu cases are low in @entity27 and @entity160 , though the east coast of @entity162 and southeast @entity163 continue to struggle with outbreaks one cause for concern was the fact that few scientists had considered the possibility of a bird flu virus infecting seals , said the researchers			1
it highlighted the fact that pandemic influenza can appear in unexpected ways			0
' @entity37 could emerge from anywhere and our readiness has to be much better than we previously realised , ' said dr @entity136			0
' we need to be very nimble in our ability to identify and understand the potential risks posed by new viruses emerging from unexpected sources			0
' it 's important to realise that viruses can emerge through routes that we have n't considered			0
we need to be alert to those risks and ready to act on them			0
' as of january 2012 , the @entity187 has confirmed there have been 583 cases of @entity190 ( avian flu ) in humans leading to 344 deaths			0
avian flu has all but disappeared from the headlines since the 2009 swine flu pandemic , but it continues to sweep across the globe , jumping from birds to humans to swine and back again			0
the flu has taken numerous forms since it first mutated and passed from birds to humans -- with varying degrees of infectiousness and lethality			0
the 2009 ' swine flu ' outbreak of @entity98 became a global pandemic when it infected millions of people and spread to nearly every country			0
the virus was thought to have spread from birds and later transmitted to pigs , which served as a ' mixing vessel , ' which allowed the infection of humans			2
it was widespread , but the symptoms were relatively mild , similar to season flu			0
public health officials fears the flu would mutate again and become more virulent , but that never happened			0
the mortality rate remained at just 0.002 percent -- killing just two out of 100,000 people infected			0
the strain spread to the @entity43 in april 2009 and by may 2010 , the @entity187 declared the pandemic over			2
a more deadly , and concerning , strain , @entity190 , has spread to 15 countries after being transmitted to humans from poultry			2
since 2003 , the @entity187 has discovered 607 cases of the disease in humans , killing 358 people			2
in 2012 , 29 people have been infected so far and 18 have died			0
however , the disease is confined to just 15 countries in @entity163 , @entity162 and the @entity235 and has yet to reach the western world			0
so far in 2012 , human cases have been isolated to @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 .			2

the @entity16 strain was discovered after the death of 162 @entity7 seals
the virus could target a protein found in human lungs causing immune system to go into overdrive and attack itself
this would leave lungs *vulnerable* to pneumonia and *bacterial* infections
