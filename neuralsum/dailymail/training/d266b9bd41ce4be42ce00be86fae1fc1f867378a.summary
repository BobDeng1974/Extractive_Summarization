researchers have found evidence of what could be the first carpenters at work			0
archaeologists in @entity6 found the 7,000 year old wooden water wells near @entity8 , they are the oldest known wooden constructions in the world , and contradict the common belief that metal was necessary for complex timber constructions			1
the four constructions found near @entity15 , which are believed to be the earliest wooden constructions ever found the farmers cleaved the trunks into boards , assembling them to make chest - like well linings with complex corner joints			2
using state - of - the - art laser scanning technology , the scientists collected data on the timbers and tool marks and documented the highly developed woodworking skills of the early @entity30 settlers			1
the very well - preserved tool marks and timber joints testify to unexpectedly sophisticated timber construction techniques			2
they were built by the @entity35 , which existed from roughly 5600 to 4900 bc. a research team led by @entity37 and dr. @entity38 from the @entity39 of the @entity40 has succeeded in precisely dating four water wells built by the first @entity43 agricultural civilization with the help of dendrochronology or growth ring dating			2
the team 's findings , which have been published in the international scientific journal @entity50 , give new insight into prehistoric technology			0
the wells were excavated at settlements in the @entity56 region and are the oldest known timber constructions in the world			1
the researchers were able to piece together exactly how the world 's oldest carpenters made their water wells ' a total of 151 oak timbers preserved in a waterlogged environment were dated between 5469 and 5098 @entity67 and reveal unexpectedly refined carpentry skills , ' the team said			1
' the recently discovered water wells enable for the first time a detailed insight into the earliest wood architecture and display the technological capabilities of humans ~ 7000 years ago			1
' the study was conducted by archaeologists and dendrochronologists from the @entity39 in @entity40 , the @entity78 of @entity79 in @entity80 , and the @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83			0
the four early @entity30 wells were constructed from oak wood			1
in addition to the timber , many other waterlogged organic materials , such as plant remains , wooden artifacts , bark vessels , and bast fiber cords , as well as an array of richly decorated ceramic vessels , have survived for millennia hermetically sealed below groundwater level			2
with the help of dendrochronology , the scientists were able to determine the exact felling years of the trees and thus also the approximate time at which the wells were constructed			1
the tests revealed that the wood comes from massive old oak trees felled by early @entity30 farmers with stone adzes between the years of 5206 and 5098 bc. charred end grain surfaces at terminal ends of oak timbers from well a show the timbers were cut to length using fire researchers found a selection of preserved pots and even an ear of corn on the first of the four wells the farmers cleaved the trunks into boards , assembling them to make chest - like well linings with complex corner joints , and using fire to cur them to size			1
using state - of - the - art laser scanning technology , the scientists collected data on the timbers and tool marks and documented the highly developed woodworking skills of the early @entity30 settlers			1
the very well - preserved tool marks and timber joints testify to unexpectedly sophisticated timber construction techniques			0
in the course of the sixth millennium @entity67 , the nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle gave way to a sedentary lifestyle with agriculture and stock breeding in @entity43			0
this break in the history of humankind has been termed the ' @entity150			0
' a sedentary lifestyle required permanent housing , and houses are inconceivable without a developed woodworking technology			0
' in other words , the first farmers were also the first carpenters , ' the researchers wrote			0
' permanent settlement structures and agricultural production systems required fundamental innovations in technology , subsistence , and resource utilization			0
' until now , however , archaeologists have only succeeded in unearthing the soil marks left by their houses			0
the precisely dated wells will enable scientists to conduct more detailed studies on the important role of timber construction techniques for humankind 's adoption of a sedentary lifestyle			2
' our results question the principle of continuous evolutionary development in prehistoric technology , and contradict the common belief that metal was necessary for complex timber constructions , ' the researchers claimed			1
the locations of the twelve currently known neolithic water wells in @entity43			0

tests revealed that the wood comes from massive old oak trees felled by early @entity30 farmers with stone axes between the years of 5206 and 5098 bc
the wells were excavated at settlements in the @entity56 region and are the oldest known timber constructions in the world
