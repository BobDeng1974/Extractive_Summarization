britons have always been known for their stoicism			0
and when these young men were sent to @entity4 prison camps during the @entity5 , they rolled up their sleeves and made the best of it			0
using the barbed wire parameter as a trellis , a group of gardeners transformed a bleak abandoned racecourse in the middle of the @entity16 internment camp into a flourishing garden			1
a group of gardeners set up a horticultural society while at a @entity4 camp during the @entity5 it began with the men growing sweet peas in biscuits tins , but they were soon using thousands of flowers to cover the harsh barbed wire which lined the camp by the end of the war , the team were growing more than 80 different types of sweet peas , dahlias and chrysanthemums at the @entity37 camp it began with the men growing sweet peas in biscuits tins			1
but soon , they had set up a horticultural society and crafted their own ' mini @entity42 ' , using thousands of flowers which hung from the barbed wire			1
they made their own greenhouses , installed their own boiler and set up their own cold frames			1
they even hosted their own internal flower shows , governed by @entity53 rules			1
and , by the end of the war , the society - which had more than 900 members - was growing more than 80 different types of sweet peas , chrysanthemums and dahlias at the @entity37 camp			1
it was all made possible by the @entity53 in @entity60 , with which the camp 's dedicated horticultural society was affiliated since it began in 1916			1
the @entity53 recruited help from volunteers to send packages of seeds and bulbs to the camp through the @entity69			1
despite food being scarce - and being sent bulbs by the dozen - the gardeners focused more on flowers , attempting to turn the bleak camp into something more homely			1
but they did more than just dabble in vegetable growing			0
at its peak , the society was producing 33,000 lettuces and 18,000 bunches of radishes , which they used to supplement their diet			2
they also produced pumpkins , cauliflower and potatoes , which they shared with fellow inmates - and even sold some to the @entity4			2
despite food being scarce , the gardeners mainly worked on flowers ( right ) , although they did dabble in vegetables , including pumpkins ( left ) the garden - described as a ' mini @entity42 ' - was started in the middle of an abandoned race course they managed to keep their garden flourishing by using packages of seeds and bulbs which were sent to the camp through the @entity69 now , the story of one of those men is being featured as part of the @entity104 at @entity106 exhibition at the @entity107 in @entity60			1
@entity108 , a merchant seaman , spent four years working on the garden at the camp - a hobby he continued when he returned to the @entity112			1
his talent was passed through three generations , with his daughter @entity115 and granddaughter @entity116 both keen gardeners			0
his great - granddaughter @entity118 is now a garden designer			0
mr @entity108 's incredible story was discovered after the @entity53 launched a campaign , searching for relatives of the @entity16 gardeners			1

the dedicated society was affiliated with the @entity53 in @entity60 the gardeners also dabbled in growing fruit , which they even sold to some on the @entity4 in the camp entrants to the @entity135 held on march 30 , 1918 @entity116 , 68 , who lives in @entity136 , @entity137 , said : ' he learnt all his gardening skills in @entity16 and carried on when he returned home after the war			1
' he always had big gardens to grow his fruit and vegetables and grew wonderful begonias and sweet peas			0
he was still gardening until he died at the age of 94			0
' i have very strong memories of helping him pick strawberries			0
he 'd always get me to whistle as i picked so i would n't be tempted to eat them			0
' @entity153 was sailing from @entity154 to @entity155 with the merchant navy when war was declared in 1914			0
@entity153 with his wife @entity158 outside their home in @entity161			0
his story features in an exhibition entitled @entity104 and @entity5 @entity153 with granddaughter @entity116 and dog @entity164			2
he continued gardening until he was 94 he was incarcerated in hulks on the @entity167 with his crew mates , until the @entity69 appealed and they were sent to @entity16			1
he was among 5,000 @entity112 citizens at the overcrowded camp , which was described when it opened as ' scandalously inadequate ' and ' not fit to keep pigs in			2
' the prisoners worked together to transform the camp into a self - governing society , with its own newspapers , postal service and clubs			2
the @entity178 , which had 900 members , was started in 1916 and became affiliated to the @entity112 @entity53 society			1
the front cover of a membership card for the @entity178 @entity116 added : ' the prisoners built all their own greenhouses and cold frames and even had a boiler , which they had to keep going through the night			2
' they grew vegetables on about half the racecourse and grew huge numbers of cauliflowers and leeks and potatoes			2
in the end they were even selling vegetables to the @entity4			0
' it 's amazing what they managed to achieve and how the gardening took off			2
they even had flower and vegetable shows following @entity53 rules			2
' it was like a mini @entity42 in the middle of a @entity4 internment camp			1
' @entity115 's daughter @entity207 inherited his greenfingers and continued to garden until she was 90			2
today his great - granddaughter @entity210 has become a garden designer and his great - grandson @entity212 has a huge allotment			0
' @entity214 passed on his knowledge and love of gardening to us all			0
i think he would be proud of @entity212 's potato plot , ' added @entity116			0
@entity220 , head of @entity221 at the @entity53 , says the society gradually grew from modest beginnings			1
she said : ' the story of the @entity178 is a remarkable tale of the power of gardening to improve people â€™s quality of life , even in the most adverse conditions			0
' starting with miniature gardens in biscuit tins , the inmates of @entity16 set up a flourishing horticultural society , complete with flower shows , nurseries , hot houses and eventually large scale food production			1
' throughout the war , the @entity53 mobilised its members and key nurseries to keep the @entity178 equipped with seeds , bulbs and advice			1
' at its peak the @entity178 was producing 33,000 lettuces , 18,000 bunches of radishes and 7,000 pounds of green beans			0
' by 1918 these efforts meant that the men in the camp had a much better diet than the native @entity4 population which was enduring severe food shortages			0
' we put out an appeal to descendants of @entity16 inmates and we were overwhelmed with responses			0
we hope that the resulting exhibition shines a light on this little known story from the @entity5			0
