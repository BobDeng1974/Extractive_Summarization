the @entity5 contracts awarded on tuesday to @entity2 and @entity64 cover design , building , testing their spaceship and up to six missions to fly astronauts to the station , a pace of roughly two per year			1
@entity85 - based @entity64 , owned and operated by technology entrepreneur @entity86 , says it can create and fly the taxi for $ 2.6 billion , compared to @entity2 's $ 4.2 billion bid			1
' i think it 's a vital next step in @entity64 's progress , ' @entity86 said in an interview on @entity94			1
