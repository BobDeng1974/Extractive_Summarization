by @entity0 for the @entity1 at some point , @entity3 ’s spot - kick will re-enter @entity6 ’s atmosphere , scattering debris in its wake			1
when it returns to terra firma @entity10 will still be reflecting on the chances they blew to send @entity14 into a tailspin			1
it was comfortable for the league champions in the end			2
on - loan @entity20 ’s first goal for the club brought an early birthday present for his watching father @entity24			1
but the outcome of this game undoubtedly hinged on two penalties early in the second half			0
@entity3 , the gangling @entity10 matchwinner against @entity30 on the opening day of the @entity33 season , struck a dubious award high into the heavens in the 54th minute			1
@entity3 blazes a horrendous penalty over @entity38 's crossbar it was a real head in hands moment for @entity3 as he wasted the chance to drag @entity10 level and moments later @entity43 showed @entity3 how it 's done from 12 yards within 60 seconds another @entity47 award at the other end was thumped past @entity49 by @entity43			1
the contrast between the execution of the penalties was stark			0
for @entity10 the game was up			2
@entity14 : @entity38 ; @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 45 ) ; @entity59 , @entity60 ; @entity61 ( @entity62 72 ) , @entity63 ; @entity20 ( @entity64 64 ) subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 goals : @entity20 ( 24 ) , commons ( 57 pen ) , @entity73 ( 61 o.g ) booked : @entity57 , @entity58 @entity10 : @entity49 ; @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity73 ; @entity77 ( @entity78 78 ) , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 ( @entity83 64 ) ; @entity3 ( @entity84 78 ) subs not used : @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 booked : @entity76 , @entity84 referee : @entity47 attendance : 15,522 asked if there was a lack of conviction to @entity3 ’s lofted , awful attempt @entity96 took solace in black humour			1
' i think there is a lot of conviction in it			2
it ’s still coming down			2
' he has gone up there and smashed it and i would rather someone went up there with a bit of conviction than flaff it or try to chip it			0
' at least @entity3 has had the strength to go up and take it but that ’s the small margins in football			2
' the boys rallied round him at the end			0
he is a big character and we move on			0
you miss some , you score some			0
' at 1 - 0 down you score that and it ’s a different game			1
you miss it , @entity14 go up the park and score			1
' the penalty was hardly an isolated chance			0
@entity77 struck the crossbar with a great chance at the end of the first half			0
@entity73 ’s own goal handed @entity14 a cheap third goal and merely confirmed the feeling that @entity10 were architects of their own downfall once again against @entity14			1
there were plenty pre-match who fancied the @entity143 side			0
the @entity33 leaders were available at a generous 11/1 at one bookmaker			0
against an unconvincing @entity14 side of late that looked a very decent bet			2
yet @entity20 , on loan from @entity149 , had a motivation of his own driving him on			1
the striker ’s father celebrates his birthday today and after opening his account last night the player said : ' i have good people around me , not only my father but many people that are good			0
on - loan @entity149 striker @entity20 fires in his first goal for @entity14 the @entity163 hitman wheels away to celebrate his powerful strike @entity20 is delighted to get off the mark for his temporary club @entity62 ( 27 ) thought he had also scored his first @entity14 goal - but it 's chalked off for offside “ since it ’s his birthday he is my dad that was a birthday present for him			1
' he was here tonight as always and i am trying to get him tickets for @entity171 – he is a big fan			0
' i heard @entity171 was a @entity14 fan but he is sold out and i am not getting a follow back on @entity172			2
' maybe after the goal tonight we can sort it out			0
this is what i want to give dad for his birthday			0
' the @entity163 blew a golden chance for his first goal in @entity14 colours when @entity76 ’s efforts to usher a @entity61 through ball back to @entity49 was poor , allowing @entity20 to nip in and slot wide			1
@entity43 and @entity59 – with a thumping half volley from 18 yards – forced @entity49 into further resistence before @entity20 justified the decision to hand him the number nine shirt			1
@entity54 had one of his best nights in some time here , unfortunate to lose the man of the match award to @entity59			0
the @entity194 foisted a series of inviting crosses into the area and his first , a piercing , curling effort , was headed unconvincingly up in the air by @entity75 - dropping invitingly for @entity20 to thump the ball into the net			2
@entity73 is floored after putting through this own net @entity10 keeper @entity49 ca n't believe @entity73 's own goal that killed off any hopes of a comeback @entity20 earns a handshake with his manager after his second half substitution @entity14 captain @entity59 slides in on @entity10 ' @entity77 yet @entity10 were n’t dead			1
not by a long way			0
@entity54 ’s attacking heroics are often cancelled out by a defensive rush of blood and so it proved before half - time when his slack , aimless pass across his own 18 yard line deceived his team - mates and sent @entity77 in on goal			2
it was a glorious chance			0
one the winger almost tried too hard with , his thumping over-hit shot rattling off the face of the crossbar when he only had to guide the ball past @entity38			0
with the booked @entity57 taken off before he was sent off after an early booking , @entity10 sensed a renewed vulnerability in their hosts and earned their reward for a strong start to the second half with the @entity3 spot - kick			1
it was a distinctly soft award , the @entity163 caught by @entity236 in the area as he sought to control the ball			0
but everything about @entity3 ’s spot kick was wrong			2
his run - up , his shooting action , the lax leaning back finish which flew over the crossbar , soaring towards @entity14 ’s @entity246 ’s deserted top tier			2
@entity14 keeper @entity38 watches as @entity3 blasts his penalty into orbit just moments later @entity76 brings down @entity20 for a @entity14 penalty and @entity43 made no mistake from 12 yards with a cool finish @entity63 tried to get in on the act but he 's off target @entity43 smashes his penalty past a static @entity49 emboldened @entity14 made @entity10 pay for their wastefulness			1
racing onto an @entity55 long ball @entity20 was clattered wildly by the upper arm of @entity76			2
the central defender was booked , but the greater punishment came from the boot of commons , last season ’s top scorer rasping his spot kick low into the net for 2 - 0			1
from @entity77 ’s shot against the crossbar to @entity3 ’s penalty atrocity , @entity10 had cause to wonder how it had come to this			1
their wounds became gaping in 62 minutes when left - back @entity73 scored a mildly farcical own goal			1
@entity14 goalscorers @entity43 and @entity20 celebrate @entity59 clears the ball ahead of @entity79 the former @entity277 and @entity278 defender made the bold decision to turn an @entity63 corner back to @entity49 with his chest , but succeeded only in guiding it into the bottom corner of his own net for 3 - 0			1
for @entity14 a first clean sheet in nine games made this an unexpectedly comfortable night			1
' i was happy that @entity20 got his first goal , ' said @entity290 afterwards			1
' he has been out for a long time and not played that many matches and that ’s why we don ’ t use him for 90 minutes			0
' he made a huge impact tonight and that was good			0
' we gave away some chances but they were down to individual mistakes and they are things that we can work on			0
we had plenty of opportunities to score and i felt we were well worth our win			0

strikes from @entity20 , a @entity43 penalty and @entity73 's own goal completed a comfortable victory
@entity3 blazed a penalty over the bar with the score at 1 - 0
@entity10 boss @entity96 *joked* : ' i think there is a lot of conviction in it . it 's still coming down '
first clean sheet in nine games gives some *respite* to coach @entity290
first @entity14 goal for on - loan @entity149 striker @entity20 , who also won the hosts ' penalty
they play @entity332 at home in the quarter - finals
