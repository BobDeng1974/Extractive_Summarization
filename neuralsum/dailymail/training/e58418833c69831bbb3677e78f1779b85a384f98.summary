@entity6 , who joined @entity13 two years ago from @entity14 for about £ 2m and has since extended his contract until 2018 , is also on @entity17 's list of potential targets			1
forward thinking : @entity2 are weighing up a move for @entity8 striker @entity4 meanwhile , @entity21 are set to rival the @entity2 for the signature of @entity24 winger @entity23			1
