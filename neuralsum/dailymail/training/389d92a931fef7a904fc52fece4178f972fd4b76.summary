by @entity0 last updated at 6:42 pm on 3rd january 2012 the number of complaints about postmen leaving cards to say residents were n't in when they tried to deliver packages , when in fact the householders were home , has risen by more than a third			1
the cards are meant to be used by postmen if they knocked on the door to deliver a parcel and received no response from the resident			1
however , it appears the cards are being increasingly misused , pre-prepared by postmen seeking to lighten their loads and save time on their rounds			1
actually , i was in : the number of complaints about postmen leaving ' sorry , you were out cards ' when residents were home has risen by a third in two years in 2011 , 32,000 people complained about being left a @entity25 form , better known as a ' sorry , you were out ' card , a 14 per cent rise			1
between june and september last year alone , more than 8,500 people complained about the practice , which represents a 37 per cent increase in the same period in 2009			2
the figures show that the practice is on the rise despite promised by @entity34 to curb the problem			1
a 2009 study found that @entity34 staff were routinely leaving ' sorry , you were out ' cards without even knocking doors			1
some sorting office managers have allocated just 10 seconds per house on new delivery routes , the postal workers union @entity41 has claimed			2
it has led to postmen filling out the forms before they approach houses because they do not have enough time to complete their rounds			1
snap survey : customers queuing outside the @entity34 delivery office in @entity54 , @entity55 to collect their @entity57 parcels in december ' when we heard the allegations that people were not ringing the door bell , we reminded staff they have to ring and wait for people to answer the door , a spokesman for @entity34 told the @entity66			1
a spokesman for @entity41 acknowledged that pressure to finish greater deliveries and in some cases insufficient time built into delivery times was a factor in the increase in cards being left			1
but she also said there had been a huge rise in the number of packets , largely from internet shopping , being delivered , which require more door knocking and therefore more cards being issued			1
she also said over the past three years deliveries had been pushed back later and people were more likely to be out with the later delivery start times			0
a snap survey of sorting offices by the @entity88 , taken in mid-december , revealed queues of customers waiting to pick up parcels			0
many left empty - handed because they were too busy to wait up to 90 minutes in the @entity57 rush , while others reached the counter only to be told their item could n't be found			0
in a rush : postmen are facing limits of 10 second per property on some rounds , increasing use of the cards a variety of reasons were given for the delays			2
frustrated customers said the queues could have been avoided if @entity34 had put on extra staff to handle the workload			2
and while some parcels may have genuinely been too big for letterboxes , or needed to be signed for , a significant number of customers complained that they had been at home when their postman shoved a notice through their door and drove off			0
@entity54 , @entity55 , saw waits of 20 minutes , while customers in @entity121 waited for over an hour in temperatures of 5c			0
in @entity124 , the delays topped 90 minutes as 70 people stood in line			0
heavily pregnant teacher @entity127 , 31 , lost 30 minutes of her day in @entity128 , @entity129			0
' you can never park here so i had to walk , ' she complained			0
@entity34 apologised to customers who have ' experienced difficulties ' but stressed that it has taken steps to improve its service , such as extending opening hours for 1,400 offices and carrying out deliveries that require a signature on sundays to catch people at home			2
the company has been criticised for curtailing collections and deliveries while hiking prices and pursuing other money - spinning ventures			0
it emerged this year that the firm was seeking a five-fold increase in revenue from junk mail deliveries as profits slumped .			0

some ' *overworked* ' postmen fill out the cards before they even arrive at houses to save time , admits union
37 *%* rise in two years - despite @entity34 pledge to *tackle* the problem
