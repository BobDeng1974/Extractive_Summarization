the @entity1 lost track of 1.8million confidential patient records in a single year , the @entity0 can reveal			1
in worrying lapses in data security , sensitive paper records have been dumped in public bins and electronic records found for sale on an internet auction site			2
the worst cases include details of terminally ill patients being faxed to the wrong number , and patient records being stolen and posted on to the internet			1
worrying : the serious data security lapses have included files on a terminally ill patient being faxed to the wrong number the total is the equivalent of nearly 5,000 records going missing every day			1
but the real figure is likely to be much higher because in some incidents it was not known exactly how many records were lost			2
in addition , at present the data protection watchdog relies on hospitals declaring when data has gone missing			0
such is the scale of the problem that the watchdog , the @entity32 , is asking for powers to conduct compulsory audits on hospitals and @entity1 trusts			1
the information commissioner , @entity38 , has levied fines totalling nearly £ 1million on @entity1 bodies in the last six months			1
and last night his office warned that more would follow if data protection rules continue to be breached			0
the figures were compiled from reports of @entity46 breaches filed by the @entity32 in the 12 months from july 2011 in @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
over the year a total of 1,779,597 records were reported lost in 16 major incidents involving @entity1 bodies			1
in may this year , @entity53 and @entity54 was fined £ 325,000 after an incident involving more than 69,000 patient records found on hard disk drives offered for sale on an internet auction site			1
the drives contained an easily readable database with the names , dates of births , occupations , sexual preferences , sexually transmitted disease test results and diagnoses for more than 67,000 patients			0
costly errors : the information commissioner , @entity38 , has levied fines totalling nearly £ 1million on @entity1 bodies in the last six months			1
( posed by model ) another database contained the names and dates of birth of more than 1,500 @entity77 positive patients			0
it later emerged that 232 hard drives that should have been destroyed had been sold on the auction site			0
they also contained highly sensitive personal data of tens of thousands more patients and staff including test results , medical conditions and children ’s reports			0
@entity89 was fined £ 225,000 in june after 100,000 confidential paper records were dumped at a disused hospital site			2
trespassers gained access to the site and copies of records – which dated from the 1950s – were posted on the internet			0
@entity99 was fined £ 90,000 in april for faxing 59 patient records containing ‘ confidential and sensitive ’ data to the wrong number so they ended up with a member of the public			1
the records belonged to terminally ill patients receiving palliative care and included medical diagnoses , information about patients ’ home lives and their resuscitation instructions			1
in october last year @entity114 , @entity113 was warned after 19 patient records were found dumped in a bin			0
a midwife in @entity118 was warned after her car was broken into and thieves stole patient diaries which contained sensitive personal data about 240 pregnant women in her care			0
hospitals have also been found sending mental health patient records to the wrong patient because he had a similar name			2
the worst breach involved a cd containing 1.6million patient records , including personal details , belonging to @entity134 and @entity135 the cd was lost when a filing cabinet went missing during an office move			1
the trust was not fined , but signed an undertaking with the @entity32 not to repeat the error			0
other cases around the country have involved unsecured laptops stolen from the home of a staff member			0
@entity146 , director of privacy campaign group @entity147 , said : ‘ these figures may be shocking , but they will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the @entity1 ’s track record for dealing with patient data			2
‘ across the @entity1 there are some excellent organisations who are addressing this problem well but some of the poor performers are terrifying			2
‘ there is a real risk that if the @entity1 does n’t sort out how it looks after patients ’ details people will stop sharing information with their doctor and that could be extremely dangerous for care			1
’ the @entity32 said : ‘ @entity167 holds some of the most sensitive personal information available , so it ’s vitally important that patients ’ information is being kept secure			0

the total is the equivalent of nearly 5,000 records going missing every day
