for years this favela in @entity1 was controlled by the brutal @entity3 drugs gang who ran extortion rackets , imposed curfews , and kept the terrified population in line with violence			2
almost a quarter of the homes in the in @entity12 and @entity14 neighbourhood , built with whatever materials the poor residents could get their hands on , still have no running water or electricity			0
but for one night only 11 girls from this hillside shanty town in @entity22 were able to forget the misery of their daily lives and become princesses at their very own debutante ball			0
the ball was held at an upmarket tennis club which lent its services for the occasion , while the girls were accompanied by officers from the local @entity75			0
like most of @entity1 's poorest neighbourhoods , @entity12 and @entity14 are bordered by some of the most expensive in the world			1
just a few streets from where these girls live , families will regularly spend up to $ 50,000 to give their daughters the perfect ball to mark their 15th birthday			1
the girls often wear three dresses : one to greet guests in , one to waltz in , and another less restricting one to dance the night away in			0
emotional : two young women embrace after arriving at the venue for their debutante ball , put on by local police who are hoping to rebuild trust in communities and break up gangs who had taken control some of the girls are reduced to teas after arriving at an upmarket tennis club in @entity22 that volunteered its premises for their ball celebration : many of these girls ' families will survive on $ 30 or less a week , meaning even a modest party is far beyond their reach the debutante ball , which takes place on a girl 's 15th birthday , has a strong tradition in @entity1 , with many spending thousands on the event this favela used to be run by a brutal drug cartel , with the police occasionally raiding their stongholds before retreating			1
now a local force lives and works there 24/7 , and helps to organise events such as this one it is tradition for each party to have a theme , and some parents will hire event coordinators and designers to try and outshine the others			1
in the favelas , the average family survives on just $ 30 a week , putting even a modest celebration well beyond their reach			1
the favela debutante ball was part of new efforts to regain control of the slums around @entity22 from drug gangs by building trust in the local police forces			2
the protection units represent a new tactic in @entity1 's fight against organised crime			2
previously , heavily armed officers would raid the city 's poorest districts , battle with drug gangs , arrest as many of them as possible , then leave			2
girls sit around in a nearby hotel while a team of volunteers help them into their dresses and do their hair and makeup for them one girl from @entity22 's @entity12 and @entity161 has her hair done by a volunteer alongside a female police officer who helped to organise the event the ball is run by the @entity167 who live and work in the favela 24 hours a day in order to reclaim the streets from the @entity3 drug gang who used to operate there hundreds of homes in the @entity12 and @entity14 favelas are without power or running water , but for one night these girls were allowed to forget their daily lives and celebrate young debutantes help each other to prepare for their debutante ball in the @entity185 hotel in @entity22 , @entity1 police forces help to put on the balls in order to rebuild trust in communities whose only contact with officers up until that point was during armed raids on violent drug gangs in their neighbourhoods but for residents caught in the cross fire this bread mistrust , even hatred of the authorities , and meant they were unwilling to work with officers			1
by contrast the protection units live and work in the favelas full time , replacing the drug gangs as everyday enforcers of law on the streets			0
while it has not eliminated the problem of gangs completely , it means they can not operate in the open , and drives down violence which had become an everyday occurrence here			0
it also allows girls like these to enjoy one night away from all of their troubles and take part in the tradition of the debutante ball			0
dresses were loaned out to the girls from local shops , while volunteers helped to do their makeup and hair while many @entity1 families will spend up to $ 50,000 on their daughter 's 15th birthday ball , families in the slums live on $ 30 a week , putting even a modest party beyond their reach before meeting with the photographer , girls help each other to adjust their dresses during a debutante ball in @entity22 , @entity1 @entity12 and @entity14 neighbourhood sits on a hillside close to @entity22 , while many of the shack - like houses are without water and power			1
but for one night these girls were allowed to forget that			0

debutante balls are traditional for @entity1 girls on 15th birthday and some families will spend $ 50,000 on event
but even modest parties are beyond the reach of those living in favelas and surviving on average of $ 30 per week
local police have been helping to organise events for *country* 's poorest in effort to rebuild trust in authorities
