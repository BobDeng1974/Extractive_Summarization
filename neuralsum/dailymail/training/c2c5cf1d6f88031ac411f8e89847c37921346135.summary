a simple scan could be used to identify patients who are on the brink of having a heart attack , claim scientists			1
they have discovered an imaging technique that can be used to light up dangerous blockages in the heart			2
about 200 @entity9 a day die from heart attacks , many of which were triggered by such blockages – a ‘ ticking time bomb ’ that there is currently no way of diagnosing easily			0
scientists at @entity33 used a @entity34 – normally used to diagnose cancer – to track a chemical compound known as a radioactive tracer that is injected into the patient ’s body			1
the tracer , called f - sodium fluoride , was found to accurately identify high - risk areas in the heart by emitting a glow that could be seen on the scan			1
the areas most at risk are fatty deposits , known as plaque , in the arteries , which if they rupture will cause a clot that blocks the blood supply to the heart			2
the study , funded by the @entity55 and @entity56 , part of the @entity58 , looked at two groups of patients – 40 people who had just had a heart attack and 40 people with angina and at risk of a heart attack			1
discovery : dr @entity68 , a @entity55 clinical lecturere and cardiologist who led the research , is pictured with the @entity74 scanner the scan showed more than 90 per cent of heart attack patients had a lit - up area at the location of the blockage that caused their heart attack			1
almost half of patients with angina also had plaque that lit up , suggesting a heart attack was imminent			0
@entity55 clinical lecturer and cardiologist dr @entity68 , who led the research that was published in @entity90 medical journal , said : ‘ we have developed what we hope is a way to “ light up ” plaques on the brink of rupturing and causing a heart attack			1
' if we could know how close a person is to having a heart attack , we could step in with medication or surgery before the damage is done			0
’ researcher dr @entity102 added : ‘ until now , there have been no non-invasive imaging techniques available which can identify high - risk and ruptured coronary plaques			0
' for the first time , we have shown that this is possible , and it has the potential to transform how we identify , manage and treat patients			0
’ @entity74 scanners are in many @entity9 hospitals to assist in cancer diagnosis , but are not normally used for heart patients			1
professor @entity116 , medical director at the @entity55 , said : ‘ being able to identify dangerous fatty plaques likely to cause a heart attack is something that conventional heart tests ca n’t do			2
' this research suggests that @entity122 may provide an answer , identifying “ ticking time bomb ” patients at risk of a heart attack			0
‘ nearly 20 years of @entity55 - funded research has led us to this point			0
we now need to confirm these findings , and then understand how best to use tests like this in the clinic to benefit heart patients			0

researchers found a way to use a cancer scanner to *highlight* areas at risk
@entity74 machine show blockages in the heart which were *previously* *invisible*
@entity33 scientists developed the technique , with funding from the @entity55 and the @entity58
