@entity0 is officially a happy hammer after @entity3 's new signing patched up his relationship with @entity5 after posting tweets three years ago criticising the striker			1
@entity0 and @entity5 had n't seen eye - to - eye since december 2011 when @entity0 initially tweeted despairingly about the @entity46 international performances			2
' i went to subway and asked for the greasiest , biggest and most expensive sub they had			0
they gave me @entity52 ' he tweeted			0
the barrage of abuse continued during @entity56 as @entity5 spearheaded @entity46 's attack in @entity58 and @entity59			0
ouch : @entity0 's feud with @entity5 began in december 2011 when he compared him to a @entity62 sandwich poor : @entity0 has also tweeted that he felt @entity63 and @entity64 were better than @entity5 in the past faint praise : @entity0 even had a dig at @entity5 despite scoring for @entity46 in @entity56 up for it : @entity5 ( top right ) gave @entity46 the lead with a bullet header in their 3 - 2 win against @entity72 relative ? @entity0 mocked @entity5 's transfer fee to @entity74 in comparison to the @entity77 opening ceremony ' do n't see why @entity78 want @entity5 when both @entity63 and @entity64 are better than him # fact ' £ 27m got @entity80 the queen , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 & a cast of 1000s			1
@entity74 got @entity5 for £ 35m			0
' even when the 25 - year - old gave @entity46 the lead in their 3 - 2 win over @entity72 , the midfielder was damning in his praise with : ' carroll your a donkey , but i love you right now			2
' shocking : @entity0 called @entity3 winger @entity96 one of @entity74 's worst players in 2012 despite changing his tune with @entity5 it is unclear whether or not the former @entity102 man has made amends with @entity3 winger @entity96 yet			1
' @entity96 is one of the worst players i 've ever seen in a @entity74 shirt , any chance of him keeping the ball just once ? ' @entity0 , who penned a four - year deal from @entity102 in july , will be hoping to make his competitive debut for his new side in their @entity114 opener at home to @entity116 rivals @entity117 on saturday			1
time to shine ? @entity0 will be hoping to make his @entity3 debut against @entity117 on saturday			0

@entity0 has apologised to @entity3 team - mate @entity5
@entity0 made a *series* of abusive tweets about @entity5 when he was younger
20 - year - old has also had a pop at @entity96 in the past
@entity0 moved to @entity3 this *summer* on a four - year deal from @entity102
