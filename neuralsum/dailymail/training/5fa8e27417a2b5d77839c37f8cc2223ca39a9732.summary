in comparison the poll of 1,000 parents , carried out by the insurers @entity37 , found that 32 per cent of parents with daughters thought they needed to marry for financial reasons			0
unlike the period described in @entity23 ’s novel , which was published on january 28 , 1813 , parents today clearly think that women can make it on their own			0
