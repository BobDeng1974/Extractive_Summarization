on the outside , this mother - of - five seems like a beautiful , confident woman , but beneath her clothes is a hidden secret that 's tormented her for over a decade			1
@entity6 's unsightly varicose veins , which she describes as ' worms beneath my skin ' , crushed her confidence and gave her crippling insecurities , which meant she could n't even undress in front of her own husband			1
tonight , on my naked secret , a documentary on @entity15 , @entity6 bravely unveils her unsightly legs and undergoes drastic treatment to rid her of her decade - long burden			1
' but other people do n't know what i 'm hiding underneath my clothes			1
' ' it stops me doing activities with children and i feel i do n't look good enough for my husband			1
' i 'm so tired of hiding			1
if i have to hide anymore i 'm going to completely shut down			1
' when i look in the mirror i feel really upset , ' she admits on the documentary			1
' my clothes are a safety net			1
i feel off guard when i take my clothes off			1
' my problem is on my right leg - i 've got really bad varicose veins , ' she says bravely unveiling them			1
' they start on the top of my thigh and finish at the top of my feet			1
it 's really hard to look at myself in the mirror because my leg does n't look normal			1
' it feels like i 've got worms in my leg , ' she says referring to the wiggly protrusions that run along the back of her calf and thigh			2
before ( left ) and after ( right ) , @entity6 's legs are transformed ' it 's like they 've taken over my life - they 've taken over my body ' she says			1
varicose veins affects over 30 % of adults and are more common in women			2
pregnancy , weight gain , old age and a family history also increase their likelihood			2
the unsightly and often painful condition develops when valves in the veins stop working properly causing blood to pool in the veins , which can make them swell and enlarge			2
' they bulge out , they feel painful , they feel itchy and they feel like they are tearing up my skin , ' says @entity6			1
' i 'd feel very embarrassed if anyone saw them - they 'd think i 'm not normal			2
' i know that myself but hearing it from other people would be worse , ' she says fighting back tears			2
' i just want a normal leg			2
i just want to be normal like everyone else			2
' @entity6 has always taken pride in her appearance so she was devastated when at aged 27 unsightly blue and purple bulges started to appear			1
' they started after i had my third child , then after my fourth they became more visible			2
after my fifth , my leg looked gross			2
' i went to the doctor who diagnosed varicose veins and gave me stockings and ibuprofen gel , but it did n't work			2
' i dress around my problem by wearing long trousers and leggings , ' says @entity6			1
' i wish i could wear a dress that would make me feel really confident in myself			2
' ' i rather there 's no one in the room when i get changed and at night it 's easier to just shut the lights off , ' she continues			2
her self - esteem also has repercussions on her marriage			2
' it affects my relationship with my husband			2
although he wo n't say it i know he 's probably thinking , " i wish i did n't have to feel those lumps on your leg			0
" ' it makes me upset because for years i just wish that my leg was normal			0
i 'm at that point i 'm ready to try anything			0
' on consultation with a surgeon , @entity6 find out she needs three different types of surgery , without which her veins could become a serious health hazard			1
consultant surgeon professor @entity138 , explains , ' you have quite a strange pattern of veins			0
none of them are coming from the leg - they are all coming from the pelvis			0
if you do n't remove them you could end up getting a leg ulcer and clots , which can lead to infection and in rare cases blood poisoning			0
' @entity6 needs the veins in her pelvis removed then two different procedures to remove the veins in her legs - the laser threatment and then injections			1
' also on hand to help @entity6 restore her self - esteem is psychologist dr @entity162			1
' @entity6 has been hiding this issue for a decade			1
is she going to take control - not just practically but emotionally too ? ' she questions			0
dr @entity162 gets @entity6 to open up about her past : ' i 've got two sister and four brothers - i 'm the oldest , which adds a lot of responsibility			1
i had to be a role model			0
i had to grow up quickly			0
' ' i had first child at 19 , it was absolutely wonderful being mum - being a role model			0
i do n't like to talk to close relatives because i 'm afraid of their reaction			0
@entity6 had to undergo a series of three treatments to rid herself of her veins ' i look after myself and want to look good for my husband - i feel ashamed			1
' ' it 's as if you need to be perfect			0
' let 's focus on getting you to love all of you - letting go of your shame			0
' ' you 're focusing on one thing			0
you think it 's ugly but if you stop focusing you 'll start being able to see yourself			0
' despite never having had surgery before @entity6 decides to go ahead with the drastic series of treatments			1
dr @entity195 , performs @entity6 's pelvic coil embolisation			1
' i have to access the faulty veins and close them off completely			0
the pelvic veins are accessed via @entity6 's neck , through her heart , abdomonial cavity and then into the pelvis			1
metal coils are inserted so they no longer fill with blood			0
' the procedure takes one hour and @entity6 goes home later that day			1
the surgery on her leg veins happens in two parts and involves two - hour sessions using local anesthetic			0
the first procedure is endovenous lazer ablation and a phlebectomy where the veins are removed through incisions in the leg using a tiny hook			0
@entity219 has foam schlerotherapy , where a special substance is injected into the veins , which forces the forces blood out of veins and kills them			0
for two weeks @entity6 has to wear compression bandages and is told to expect the heeling process to take three months			1
but just seven weeks later , @entity6 is overwhelmed by the results of her series of treatments			1
' look at me ! ' she says twirling in a knee - length dress			0
' i feel so much happier - i can wear dresses and skirts and not worry about how my legs look			0
' i could never have worn something like this before			0
i 'm just so impressed with the results			0
when i used to take my clothes off i used to be so uncomfortable looking at myself			1
' now i 've got great looking legs i do n't have pain and every opportunity i want to look in mirror ! ' for ten years i 've been trapped and now i can feel confidence wherever i am			0
' my relationship with my husband now is absolutely superb			0
he can see i 'm happier person in myself and that makes him happy			0
' i now look forward to the future and i 'm feeling confident			0
it 's a great feeling			0
