by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 05:13 est , 5 january 2014 @entity2 has incited fury after banning foreigners from buying land - in the same week that its citizens gained the right to work anywhere in the @entity9			1
the country , which has seen restrictions lifted on 7.3million @entity2 to live and work in @entity13 , has reinforced a ban stopping @entity16 nationals from purchasing agricultural plots			1
but the move has prompted accusations of ' appalling hypocrisy ' and breaches the agreement which let @entity2 join the @entity9 in the first place			1
' hypocrisy ' : @entity2 has prompted fury among @entity25 mps after banning foreigners from purchasing land in the same week its citizens gained the right to work in the @entity9 @entity2 president , @entity29 , does not support the ban , describing it as ' wrong ' and has admitted the move could cause ' serious problems ' for the country 's image in @entity13			1
@entity2 's ban was due to expire on january 1 , but rebel mps passed a law in october among fears that land - which is ten times cheaper than elsewhere in central @entity13 - would be snapped up by foreign property investors			1
despite the threat of hefty fines , the ban is due to remain until 2020 unless it is overturned by @entity2 's constitutional court			2
@entity46 mp @entity45 , who is calling for tighter controls through an amendment to the @entity49 , told @entity50 on sunday : ' @entity2 has n't applied the obligations it signed up to			2
if it is n't satisfying all the terms of the treaty it does n't deserve all the benefits			0
' an @entity57 spokesperson said : ' all @entity9 countries are obliged to follow common @entity9 rules			0
those rules can be enforced by national courts			0
' the @entity61 and @entity2 's president and prime minister have already made their views on this very clear			2
' meanwhile , @entity66 leader @entity65 today addressed ' understandable ' public fears over the lifting of work restrictions on @entity2 and @entity70 and said an influx of low - skilled migrant workers will make life harder			1
but while he backed stronger border controls and ' fair ' benefit curbs , of more importance is ending the country 's ' chronic dependency on low - skill , low - wage labour , he wrote in the @entity81 on sunday			0
@entity82 : @entity2 has banned all foreign developers from purchasing agricultural plots , which are up to ten times cheaper than the rest of central @entity13 among steps @entity66 would take if it won the 2015 general election would be ending the ability of unscrupulous bosses to undercut regular staff by paying agency workers lower wages , he said			1
the @entity94 claims agency staff are paid up to Â £ 135 a week less than permanent staff despite working in the same place and doing the same job because of a loophole in the @entity100			0
migrants are over-represented among the estimated one million agency workers in the @entity25 , especially in sectors such as call centres , food production and logistics			0
mr @entity65 said he would work with the business sector to end the practice			0
public fears : labour leader @entity65 has said low - skill immigration risks making wages lower in @entity25 ' unless we act to change our economy , low - skill immigration risks making the problems of the cost of living crisis worse for those at the sharp end			1
' when millions of workers already have low pay and poor job security in @entity25 and we add high levels of low skilled migration mostly from within the @entity9 , some benefit but some lose out			1
' he added : ' it is n't prejudiced to believe that			0
' mr @entity65 has conceded that the previous @entity66 administration was wrong not to impose transitional controls when @entity131 joined the @entity9 - with far more arriving from there than anticipated			2
no official estimates have been given of the number of @entity70 and @entity2 likely to arrive in @entity25 , but amid claims they could number up to 50,000 , prime minister @entity135 has rushed through measures restricting access to jobless benefits and @entity141 healthcare			2
they came in the face of demands from @entity145 fearful of the threat posed by the eurosceptic @entity25 @entity147 , which is tipped to push the party into third place in may 's @entity13 election			0
mr @entity65 wrote : ' of course effective border control is important and while all the evidence is that most people come here to contribute , we need a benefits system that is seen to be fair			0
' but this can only be a part of the solution because public concern about immigration is also a symptom of a deeper problem : an economy that no longer works for most working people			0
' the exit of @entity25 from the @entity9 would however be ' a disaster ' , robbing the country of high - skilled foreign workers and forcing @entity25 working abroad to return home .			1
