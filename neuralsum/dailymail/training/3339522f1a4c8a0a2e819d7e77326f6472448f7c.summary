by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:05 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 05:11 est , 17 october 2013 northern voters have deserted the @entity4 because @entity5 reminds them of everything they hate about the party , a damning new analysis reveals			1
while voters in the north are just as likely to support policies on welfare , tax and law and order , the toxic @entity18 ‘ brand ’ means they refuse to back them at elections			0
mr @entity5 is urged to promote more northern mps with regional accents on to his front bench to counter the entrenched view that he cares more about the rich than ordinary people			1
mind the gap : voters in the north are more likely to take a dim view of the @entity4 by a margin of up to 10 per cent new polling shows voters in the north are significantly more likely to think mr @entity5 is out of touch , has no clear principles and is doing badly as prime minister than those in the south			1
in 2010 only 31 per cent of voters in the north backed the @entity18 , compared to 43 per cent in the rest of @entity39			0
by comparison , when @entity41 was @entity18 leader in 1951 the gap was only three points			0
some 42 per cent of voters think mr @entity5 is out of touch , compared to just 32 per cent in the south			1
asked if mr @entity5 ' has no clear principles ' , 47 per cent of people in the north agreed , much higher than the 39 per cent in the south			1
headache : @entity5 is under pressure to win back support from northern voters and 45 per cent of southern voters thought he was ' doing well as prime minister ' , but only 36 per cent of northerners agreed			1
@entity59 pollster @entity58 said the @entity4 ’ problems did not start with mr @entity5 , but neither have they lessened under his leadership			1
‘ rather , he reminds many northerners just why they dislike the @entity18 , ’ he warned in an article for @entity63			2
he found that ‘ over the decades , the north has drifted away from the rest of the country			0
’ last week 's government reshuffle was in part designed to counter the impression of the @entity18 party being too southern			0
dubbed the ' flat cap reshuffle ' a number of northern mps were given more high profile ministerial jobs			1
they included @entity78 former tv presenter @entity77 becoming employment minister and @entity80 , who was born in @entity81 , who was promoted from a junior treasury post to the rank of financial secretary			0
the collapse of heavy industry in the north , more closely associate with the @entity71 , has not led to a rise in popularity for the @entity4 – in fact the opposite has happened			2
mr @entity58 found that standards of living are ‘ actually much the same ’ in the north and south , with pay rates outside @entity97 largely in line			0
unemployment in the north stands at nine per cent compared to six per cent in the south			0
but in the @entity103 it is even higher at 10 per cent , and the @entity4 won 43 per cent of the vote there in 2010			2
northern voices : @entity78 former tv presenter @entity77 was promoted to employment minister in last week 's reshuffle while @entity81 - born @entity80 was rewarded with a more senior role in the @entity111 there is also ‘ no material difference ’ between how voters feel about their living standards or where they view themselves on the political spectrum from ‘ very right wing ’ to ‘ very left wing ’			1
on the role of the government , public services , the railways and welfare , there is almost no difference in views			0
mr @entity58 said : ‘ this simply sharpens the question - if the obvious reasons for @entity18 unpopularity in the north do not really hold up , what does explain why they are so disliked ? ‘ @entity134 dislike @entity5			2
they are significantly more likely to say he is out of touch and lacks clear principles , and much less likely to say he is doing well as prime minister			1
‘ and despite the comparable living standards and levels of optimism , northerners are much more likely to think the coalition “ is bad for people like you ”			2
’ @entity146 agreement : the views on key issues and polices vary far less between north and south while most people across the country think the @entity4 care more about the rich , ‘ the sentiment is especially intense in the north ’			1
and there appears to be no easy solution to the problem			0
mr @entity58 added : ‘ in the end , the @entity4 ’ problem is not what they do ; it ’s what they are			2
their trouble is their brand			0
’ the @entity4 are increasingly seen as a party of the south , and are urged to promote more people with regional accents on to the frontbench			1
mr @entity58 concluded : ‘ on its own , this wo n’t suddenly make the @entity4 popular on @entity173 or @entity174 ; but as part of a long - term strategy to revive the @entity18 brand north of the @entity178 , it would be a start			0

42 ***%*** of northern voters think @entity182 is out of touch , 32 ***%*** in south agree
73 ***%*** of northerners think @entity4 care about the rich not ordinary people
pollster warns @entity5 he reminds northerners why they dislike @entity4
prime minister used ministerial reshuffle to promote northern mps
