in a post on @entity31 said : ‘ about time to unveil the @entity23 and something else			1
’ but when internet commenters revealed that ‘ the @entity5 ’ had some rather rude connotations , @entity0 let slip some more information			2
‘ i love the @entity36			0
comments had me literally @entity38			0
no , it was n’t intentional			0
glad i did n’t mention the other letter ! ’ exactly what sort of car or technology ' the @entity23 ’ might be is so far a mystery			2
currently , @entity3 has about 100 ' @entity46 ' stations scattered across @entity47 and @entity48 that give @entity17 drivers a free power source when traveling long distances			2
the technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes			0
@entity3 recently opened three supercharger stations in @entity56 and plans to set up about 200 more around the world , including @entity58 , by the end of the year			0
some have suggested the other letter might be a ‘ p ’ , although what either could stand for is unknown			0
on the @entity3 forum on @entity65 one commenter speculates that @entity0 may announce driver assist technology for existing @entity3 cars			1
‘ teaser image shows the model s and the front which carries all the sensors and hardware for @entity74 , ’ said user skiesforme			0
and the ‘ something else ’ alluded to by @entity0 may be other types of driver assist technology : speed assist , lane departure warning and so on			2
on the @entity3 forums meanwhile , others speculated that it might be a car with four - wheel drive			2
based on @entity0 's next tweet ( shown ) some have suggested the announcement may be a driver - assisted version of one of @entity3 's previous cars such as the @entity17 in the image the teased car looks to be similar to the @entity17 earlier this year @entity3 revealed the ' @entity91 ' mainstream electric car the @entity17 , shown , is a five - door luxury electric car that was first introduced in june 2012			1
it has a range of 265 miles ( 426km ) on one charge and , as of last december , more than 25,000 had been sold world wide			0
some have suggested the front of ' the @entity5 ' looks similar to the @entity17 earlier this year in july @entity3 unveiled the @entity91 , a more mainstream version of their other electric vehicles priced around £ 30,000 in the @entity100 and $ 35,000 in the @entity101			1
at the time @entity0 unveiled his displeasure at being unable to call it the ‘ @entity106 ’ due to legal action from @entity105			0
the previous two @entity3 cars are called the @entity17 and the model x , and @entity0 apparently wanted to spell out the word ‘ sex ’ with all three			1
' we were going to call it model e for a while and then @entity105 sued us saying it wanted to use the @entity106 , ’ @entity0 told @entity115 at the time			2
‘ i thought this is crazy , @entity105 ’s trying to kill sex ! so we ’ll have to think of another name			0
’ exactly what the letter @entity118 ' for the new announcement is trying to spell if anything , though , remains to be seen .			0
