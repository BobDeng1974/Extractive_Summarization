by @entity0 you might think that a firm handshake , sparkling cv and a can - do attitude are the key ingredients to getting the job of your dreams			0
but a new study has found having a deep voice could be a barrier for women			2
recruiters view women with husky voices as less educated and competent , which means they are less likely to be hired			1
while females applying for jobs could be highly accomplished , recruiters view those with husky voices as less educated and competent , among other undesirable traits , according to a new study researchers at the @entity24 looked at women with ' croaky ' voices and how they were perceived , for their study which was published in the journal @entity29			1
previous research has suggested that a low vocal range , known as ‘ vocal fry ’ indicates education and power , but the new research found that recruiters view the women as less attractive , competent , educated and trustworthy			1
‘ our results show that the vocal fry fad is a hindrance to young women who are trying to find work , ’ said @entity38 from the university			0
it was reported that in 2011 young women were speaking in a croaky , rough and guttural way to emulate the speech patterns of certain celebrities like @entity49			0
‘ lack of experience due to their younger age , a historically poor economic environment and sex discrimination are all barriers to labour market success for this demographic			0
‘ given this context , our findings suggest that young women would be best advised to avoid using vocal fry when trying to secure employment			0
’ @entity62 ( pictured ) may never be out of work , but scinetists found that people with husky voices like her were only hired 30 per cent of the time compared to normal sounding voices the researchers recorded seven women between the ages of 19 and 27 and seven men aged 20 to 30 talking in their normal voice and then talking with a deliberately croaky voice			1
they were asked to say the phrase : ‘ thank you for considering me for this opportunity ’			0
then 800 people were asked to pose as recruiters and listen to each recording			0
they had to choose whether the ‘ normal ’ voice was from a more educated , competent , trustworthy or attractive person			1
they were also asked which people they would hire based on their voices			0
it was revealed that people with croaky voices were only hired 20 per cent of the time compared to the normal sounding voices			1
the recruiters also assumed that people speaking in croaky voices were less likely to be educated , competent , trustworthy or attractive			1
researchers discovered that women were more likely to be perceived negatively if they had croaky voices than men			1
‘ humans prefer vocal characteristics that are typical of population norms , ’ said professor @entity38			0
‘ while strange sounding voices might be more memorable because they are novel , humans find “ average ” sounding voices to be more attractive			2
‘ it is possible that speakers of vocal fry are generally perceived less favourably because vocal fry is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in voice pitch relative to normal speech			2
‘ previous studies show that when women try to lower the pitch of their voice they are perceived as less attractive , ’ he added			2
‘ you could view the results we found as an extension of this to an economic context , whereby deliberate lowering of voice pitch in a sex - atypical manner by women through vocal fry results in negative perceptions by potential employers			2

researchers at the @entity24 found that recruiters view women with husky voices as less educated and competent
in their *experiment* , people with croaky voices were only hired 20 per cent of the time , compared to the normal sounding voices
they discovered that women were more likely to be perceived negatively because of a croaky voice , than men
