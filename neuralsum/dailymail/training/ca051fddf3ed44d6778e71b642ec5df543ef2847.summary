he insisted that they had married in secret in 2010 and said he has never had any interest in ms @entity3 ’s £ 35 million fortune – substantiating his claim by revealing he signed two financial agreements before the wedding			1
the former screen goddess , 85 , last week claimed he was a ‘ vulture ’ who duped her into marrying to get his hands on her money			0
but mr @entity5 , a @entity27 businessman himself said to be worth £ 36 million , said : ‘ it ’s monstrous			1
she knows we are married and i have never been interested in her money			0
i am an independently wealthy businessman and i have earned every penny i own			0
we signed two financial agreements before the wedding			0
‘ one was a separation of assets , so although we are married we have our own independent assets			0
the second was a pre-nuptial agreement so i stand to earn absolutely nothing from the marriage			0
’ ms @entity3 has claimed to @entity10 police that she had discovered mr @entity5 had used fake documents to carry out a marriage by proxy without her knowledge just over two years ago			1
in such a ceremony , an absent bride or groom ’s vows can be spoken by someone else on their behalf			0

i am a very private person and i am only speaking about this because @entity3 has said some very hurtful things publicly in the press			1
‘ i believe she has been turned against me and against everyone else who loves her – her family and friends – by a new adviser			0
it breaks my heart to hear her speaking about me the way she is			0
’ @entity75 ’s claims add a new twist to a story so bizarre it is worthy of any @entity80 blockbuster			0

leading man : @entity5 with @entity3 , left , and @entity107 , the woman who says she stood in for @entity108 at her wedding , right but mr @entity5 , who drives a @entity110 , now claims they could not bear to be apart and got back together four months later , keeping their relationship secret to avoid publicity			1
he said they decided to marry by proxy to avoid the media attention their previous wedding plans had attracted			2

mrs @entity107 said that she and mr @entity5 , who is a family friend in @entity1 , went with miss @entity3 to see a notary to sign the legal papers			1
‘ of course i thought it was strange that she did n’t want to attend her own wedding , but if a woman like that asks , you do n’t say no , ’ she added			0
‘ i ’ve met her many times when she visited @entity5 in @entity27 and i ’m astounded she now claims to know nothing about me or the wedding			1
’ mr @entity5 , whose full name is @entity194 , said : ‘ the idea @entity3 did not know she was getting married is preposterous			1
‘ she was as keen as i was to marry			0

speaking from her office in @entity223 , near @entity96 , she said : ‘ you have to remember @entity3 is 85 so she sometimes has trouble remembering things but i can tell you she is legally married			1
there is legal documentation in @entity27 which proves that she agreed to be married and that the ceremony took place			1
‘ i do n’t really want to go into too much detail as i ca n’t betray my lawyers ’ oath – also i no longer represent @entity3 as we had a disagreement			2
‘ i accompanied @entity3 to @entity1 and documents were signed at the @entity10 consulate which authorised the marriage and this document was used for the marriage			1
