it has often been the case that cheating partners who get caught have a long list of excuses to explain away their liaisons			0
but now scientists have discovered an ' infidelity gene ' that could mean cheating women will be able to simply say their genes made them do it			1
females who carry a specific variant of a gene which affects social behaviour and sexual motivation have a greater propensity to take part in ' extra pair mating ' , researchers from the @entity12 in @entity13 found			2
variations of the @entity25 gene affect females ' propensity to cheat but do not have the same affect on men variants of combinations of the @entity25 gene have been found to be associated with promiscuity and ruthlessness in animals , the @entity29 reported			1
each person carries two @entity25 genes - one inherited from each parent - so there are a number of potential combinations			0
but these variations only appear to affect females rather than males			0
dr @entity44 , a professor of psychology at the university , worked with a team of geneticists and neuroscientists to examine the dna and lifestyles of more than 7,000 people			0
they found that of the 6.4 per cent of women who had been unfaithful , a large amount of them had a specific variant of the ' infidelity gene			1
' ' overall , these findings confirm genetic underpinnings of extrapair mating in humans , ' the scientists said in a research paper			2
women who contain a specific variation of a gene are more likely to cheat on their partner , scientists found the scientists said the findings were surprising , as it is generally thought that behaviour is affected by a combination of different genes as well as social and cultural factors			1
last year researchers from the @entity12 found that infidelity could be inherited			2
they found that 63 per cent of unfaithful behaviour in men and 40 per cent in women could be put down to genetic interference , including variations of specific genes .			0

scientists have found variations of a gene are linked to ' extrapair mating '
variants of ' infidelity gene ' make women more likely to cheat on partners
@entity12 scientists studied dna and lives of 7,378 people
they found variant of gene *present* in large number of unfaithful women
variants of @entity25 gene only has an impact on women , scientists found
