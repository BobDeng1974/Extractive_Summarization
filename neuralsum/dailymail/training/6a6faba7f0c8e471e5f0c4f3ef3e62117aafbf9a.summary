by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor public support for staying in the @entity3 has surged , according to a new poll			1
more than half the public now say they would vote to stay in the union - while the proportion of voters certain to support @entity10 at the next election has slumped to just four per cent			1
support for leaving the @entity3 , meanwhile , has fallen to just 37 per cent , the @entity13 survey found			2
just a year after @entity15 promised an in - out referendum on the @entity3 , support for @entity18 has surged			1
more than half the public now back staying in the union - compared to just 37 per cent who want to get out it marks a dramatic shift in public support for @entity18 since @entity15 's pledge to hold an in - out referendum last year			1
in november 2012 , 44 per cent said they would vote to stay in the @entity3 - with 48 per cent saying they would vote to get out			0
the growing support for @entity18 comes despite polls predicting @entity31 is on course to win next week 's @entity34 elections , ahead of both @entity35 and the @entity36			1
but , according to today 's poll , @entity10 's may struggle to carry their momentum into next year ’s general election			1
the survey found the proportion of voters certain to vote @entity10 drops from nine per cent in next week 's @entity34 elections to just four per cent at the general election			1
more than half the public think a vote for @entity10 in may next year will be a wasted vote			2
in contrast , @entity35 , the conservatives and the @entity47 are all likely to do better in the general election that in next week 's european poll , @entity13 's survey suggests			2
a chunk of voters who claim they are certain not to vote @entity36 or @entity35 at the @entity34 elections would consider backing the two main parties in next year 's @entity56 contest			1
some 57 per cent of voters said they would definitely not vote @entity36 next week - but only 46 per cent ruled out backing @entity15 in the general election			1
for @entity35 , just over half have ruled out backing the party next week - but this drops to 43 per cent for next year 's parliamentary election			0
@entity10 leader @entity31 , who insisted his controversial poster campaign against @entity3 migration was not racist , has predicted that his party will win next week 's @entity34 elections			1
but today 's poll suggests he will struggle to turn seats in @entity18 to victories in @entity56 there is also a strong indication that mr @entity15 's pledge to renegotiate @entity73 's relationship with the @entity3 carries broad support			2
just three in ten @entity75 are happy to see the country 's relationship with @entity34 ' remaining broadly the same as at present ’ , which @entity79 suggested would be the case during his tv debates with mr @entity31			0
the same proportion want the relationship ' returning to being part of an economic community , without political links ’			0
one in five would like to see ‘ @entity73 leaving the @entity3 altogether ’ , but moves towards ‘ closer political and economic integration ’ with the @entity3 is the least favoured option - with just 13 per cent support			0
voters are also the least likely to describe themselves as @entity10			0
since @entity15 promised an in - out referendum on the @entity3 , support for leaving has plummeted , according to today 's poll when asked ‘ generally speaking , do you think of yourself as @entity36 , @entity35 , @entity47 , @entity98 , or what ? ’ just 5 per cent said they thought of themselves as @entity10			1
this is despite the fact that the party is currently supported by up to 15 per cent of @entity75 according to polls			0
just under a third of the public see themselves as @entity35 - while a quarter consider themselves ‘ conservative ’			0
just nine per cent say they are ‘ @entity47 ’			0
despite this , half of the public agree that the party is highlighting important issues which other parties are n’t taking seriously enough - including 52 per cent of @entity36 supporters and 44 per cent of @entity35 voters			0
opinion is more evenly split as to whether @entity10 is out of touch with the modern world - 43 per cent saying they are a party out of touch with the modern world and 40 per cent disagreeing			0
@entity126 , @entity127 at @entity13 , said : ' the rise of @entity10 is one of the key political events over the last few years , even though many people still do n’t see themselves casting a vote for @entity10 , especially once the @entity34 elections are over			2
' but the party is pushing some of the right buttons for the public - even among those who are planning on voting @entity35 or @entity36			0
' meanwhile , on the issues of the election , after several years of hostility to @entity34 after the crash , people seem more willing to stay in the @entity3 – though a reduction in its powers is still more popular than further integration			2

support for staying in @entity3 has surged since @entity15 promised referendum
