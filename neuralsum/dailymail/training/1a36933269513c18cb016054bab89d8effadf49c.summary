she 's famous for her colourful love life and penchant for plastic surgery but according to @entity4 , 35 , those days are long gone			1
instead , the bodybuilder turned investigative journalist says that she 's single , happy and putting her career first - even if that does mean putting her love life on hold			1
' it 's not that i do n't want to meet someone , ' she admits			2
' but for now , career comes first			1
if i do n't meet someone , i need to know that my mortgage will be paid and my future is secure			1
no one else is going to do that for me			2
the latter is something she returns to on her latest @entity39 series , @entity40 ... which along with plastic surgery , sees her take on mail order brides , ' lying , cheating men ' and virgins			1
' whenever we decide to do a new show , it 's either something i can relate to or that i find fascinating , ' she explains			1
' i 've always been fascinated by the idea of mail order brides for instance			1
do people really just order them ? ' with the surgery one , i 've had surgery and it went wrong			1
i 'm very open about it			1
i was very willing and open to show that because people should know the dangers of surgery			1
' this is at the heart of @entity62 's new drive for tv ratings			2
chatting at nineteen to the dozen down the phone from her home in @entity69 , she 's clearly passionate about supplanting @entity70 and co and bringing issues that she sees as deeply important to a wider audience			2
investigative : the last series of @entity40 ... saw her meet bodybuilder and steroid abuser @entity78 new career : @entity4 's current work is a world away from the glamour modelling and reality tv of a decade ago ask her about surgery and she 's refreshingly frank , telling you how a botched boob job left her life ' destroyed ' for the best part of a year - an experience that she describes as ' horrendous '			1
' it did destroy my life for the best part of a year , ' she admits			2
' i could n't work			2
i could n't show my body to anyone			2
i had such a tough year			2
' but , ' she adds , ' when i did start talking about what happened to me , it turned out that it was n't that rare			2
i realised that lots of people have complications with their boob jobs			2
' they rush out to have a boob job because everyone is having one and they do n't realise there are risks involved			1
' i did n't think that there was any risk			0
my downfall was not researching my surgeon enough			0
that 's the biggest mistake i made			0
too many people probably do do that			0
you should do proper research			0
at the very least , get someone who 's worked in the @entity120 before			0
' now healed and happy , @entity62 says she has no plans to change anything else in the near future , although says she would quite like to have a reduction at some point			1
familiar : tonight 's episode is about plastic surgery , which @entity4 says has n't always gone well for her fascinating : @entity4 has long been fascinated by the concept of mail order brides and has delved into their world ' there 's nothing i want done , ' she cackles , chuckling madly			1
' boob wise , i might have a reduction in future because they are enormous and i do n't think i want @entity139 when i 'm 50			1
' @entity140 , i 'm happy with my body and face			0
' one part of her life that she 's less happy with is her love live and that , conveniently enough , provided the inspiration for the third documentary in the four - show run - lying , cheating men			1
' that 's a personal mission of mine , it 's almost like a vendetta , ' shivers @entity62 , whose own experience includes a failed engagement to @entity158 , @entity159 , and a brief fling with @entity162 's @entity161 , as well as a lesbian relationship with a hairdresser named @entity165			1
' it 's a bit like closing a chapter			0
i 've been lied to so many times by men			1
one of the reasons i 've been single and celibate so long is because i 've had such bad experiences			0
' it 's certainly true that love has n't always been kind to @entity62 , although as she admits , her continual questioning of her boyfriends ( and girlfriends ) words probably has n't helped			0
' i truly think if you 're clever , you can catch somebody out for lying , ' she explains			0
' the majority of people lie and you can either turn a blind eye or go digging for the truth			0
@entity187 plans : @entity4 says she is focusing on her career at the moment but would love to meet someone one day ' there have been so many boyfriends in the past who have lied to me but i would rather know the truth and be hurt than go on living a lie			1
' i am very cynical about relationships , just because i 've seen so much cheating and lying			1
' she tells of being particularly shocked while visiting the @entity202 headquarters of a married dating service and found the idea of someone paying to cheat on their spouse nothing short of mortifying			2
nevertheless , despite being a self - confessed cynic , she admits that she would like to find someone special - ' my mum and dad have been together for 40 years ' , she chirps , longingly - whether man or woman			2
' i do n't think you can ever decide who you 're going to be with , ' says @entity62			0
' i also believe you can fall in love with someone either sex because its not so much about sexuality , it 's about love			0
' i do n't believe in being gay , straight or bi-sexual , i just believe in loving humans			0
' for now , a self - confessed happy singleton , her eyes are focused on her career - and on her one - woman mission to supplant @entity229 and @entity230 from their perch			1
' i love @entity229 but i think there 's room for me as well , ' she smiles			1
@entity62 , who can point to being briefly held hostage in a @entity236 brothel as well as being threatened with a machete by an irate @entity239 while filming , certainly is n't short of the cojones needed to pull it off			0
free love : @entity4 says she does n't believe in being gay , straight or bi-sexual - just falling in love the final show in the series , virgins , saw her live in a @entity248 slum for a week , while pursuing stories about @entity250 and sex - trafficking with her crew			1
she 's also working on another two documentaries , one of which is apparently so dangerous ( she wo n't say exactly what it 's about ) , she 's had to increase her life insurance premium			0
despite the risks , however , @entity62 says she 's got designs on @entity70 's investigative crown - and has pulled in a film crew who spend most of their time producing current affairs programmes dispatches and @entity267 to help her do it			0
' the show is like @entity230 and @entity229 in the sense that it 's investigative but in this case , i 'm going on the journey as well , ' she explains			1
' my aim was always to educate , inform and entertain and if you watch it , you will laugh , cry and definitely scream			0
' @entity276 , ' she says excitedly , ' you get my innermost thoughts as well			0
there 's no weird editing , no fake set up stuff			0
it is literally me going to meet real people who have incredible stories to tell			0
' and the presence of a @entity267 film crew has only made her happier			0
' to have the crew i have is beyond an honour , ' she says , almost exploding with excitement			0
' i am so grateful to be working with this crew doing a @entity4 show on a hardcore topic			1
this is it for me , this is where i want to be			0
this is all my dreams come true			0
