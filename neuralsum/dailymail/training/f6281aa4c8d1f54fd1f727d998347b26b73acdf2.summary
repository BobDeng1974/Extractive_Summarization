youngsters in @entity1 are being stoned to death for having haircuts and wearing clothes that emulate the ‘ emo ’ style popular among western teenagers			1
at least 14 youths have been killed in the capital @entity10 in the past three weeks in what appears to be a campaign by @entity14 militants			1
militants in @entity14 neighbourhoods , where the stonings have taken place , circulated lists yesterday naming more youths targeted to be killed if they do not change the way they dress			1
@entity1 activists said this unnamed teenager was brutally killed by religious police for having an ' emo ' hairstyle the killings have taken place since @entity1 ’s interior ministry drew attention to the ‘ emo ’ subculture last month , labelling it ‘ @entity34 ’ and ordering the community police force to stamp it out			1
fans of the ‘ emo ’ trend – short for emotional – wear tight jeans and have distinctive long , black or spiky haircuts			1
the bodies of at least 14 youths have been taken to three hospitals in eastern @entity10 bearing signs of having been beaten to death with rocks			1
after reports of the stonings circulated on @entity1 media , the interior ministry said this week that no murders on its files could be blamed on attacks on ‘ emos ’			1
religious extremists have been harassing and killing teenagers with ' strange ' or ' emo ' appearances @entity1 ’s leading @entity14 clerics have condemned the stonings			1
@entity1 's @entity59 released a statement on the interior ministry 's website condemning the ' emo phenomenon ' among @entity1 youth , declaring its intent to ' eliminate ' the trend			1
the move is part of a wider clampdown on young people taking on what government officials call ' @entity74 appearances ' in @entity1			1
' the @entity77 phenomenon or devil worshipping is being followed by the @entity59 who have the approval to eliminate ( the phenomenon ) as soon as possible since it 's detrimentally affecting the society and becoming a danger , ' the statement read			2
' they wear strange , tight clothes that have pictures on them such as skulls and use stationary that are shaped as skulls			2
they also wear rings on their noses and tongues , and do other strange activities			2
' a group of armed men dressed in civilian clothing led dozens of teenagers to secluded areas a few days ago , stoned them to death , and then disposed their bodies in garbage dumpsters across the capital , according to activists , activists told the @entity108 - based @entity107 website			2
the armed men are said to belong to ' one of the most extremist religious groups ' in @entity1			2
' first they throw concrete blocks at the boy 's arms , then at his legs , then the final blow is to his head , and if he is not dead then , they start all over again , ' one person who managed to escape told @entity107			2
@entity1 's moral police was granted approval by the @entity120 to enter @entity10 schools and pinpoint students with such appearances , according to the interior ministry 's statement			2
the exact death toll remains unclear , but @entity127 of @entity128 , an ngo dealing with @entity1 issues , said the current figure ranges ' between 90 and 100			0
' ' what 's most disturbing about this is that they 're so young , ' she said			0
this ' emo ' youth was one of nearly 100 who were targeted for having a western hairstyle or wearing ' @entity141 jeans ' @entity142 said the killings appear to have been carried out by extremist @entity14 militias in mostly poor @entity14 neighborhoods and said she suspected ' there 's complicity of the @entity149 in the killings			1
' photos of the victims were released on @entity153 , causing panic and fear among @entity1 students			0
described as both a cult and sect , it ’s name derives from the word ‘ emotional ’ its teen followers dress in black , favouring tight jeans , t - shirts , studded belts and sneakers or skater shoes			0
hair is often dyed black and straightened , and worn in a long fringe brushed to one side of the face			0
music also plays a critical role , @entity77 like guitar - based rock with emotional lyrics – bands such as @entity177 , @entity178 , and @entity179 are particular favourites			0
they regard themselves as a cool , young sub-set of the @entity184			0
with the trend comes accusations of self - harming and suicide – something its followers strongly deny			0
a young man with long hair was among those fearful at the government - ordained harassment of teenagers with @entity74 appearances			0
' i have long hair but that does n't mean i 'm an @entity77			0
i 'm not less of a man if i have long hair			0
let 's not say that if i have long hair , i 'm a homosexual , but i have long hair because this is my style , this is me , ' he told @entity1 's @entity205 television network			0
@entity206 , an mp , said on thursday that ' some students have been recently arrested because they were wearing @entity141 jeans or had @entity74 haircuts			0
' the interior ministry has not disclosed the number of teenage victims , but released a follow - up statement on thursday warning extremists ' not to step on public freedom of @entity1			1
' news of the gruesome deaths drew a stern reaction from @entity1 's prominent @entity14 cleric , grand ayatollah @entity219 , who criticised the stoning of the young men as ' an act of terrorism			1
' he added : ' the @entity149 took this situation very seriously and received an approval from the @entity120 to set a plan under my full supervision and to allow us to enter schools in the capital			1
' ' there are some cases of the spread of this phenomenon specifically among schools in @entity10 , but we are facing great difficulty in the lack of women on the force who would allow us to carry the investigation more accurately since the phenomenon is more popular among girls between the ages of 14 and 18			0

number of deaths could be even *higher*
cleric calls the stonings ' an act of terrorism '
@entity149 ' complicit ' in the killings
