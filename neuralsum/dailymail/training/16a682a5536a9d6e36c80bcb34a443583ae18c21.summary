@entity1 's smart tvs made the headlines earlier this week when its privacy policy suggested the sets are capable of listening to private conversations			1
it caused such a furore that the @entity9 tech giant has since issued a blog post clarifying its policy and vehemently denying the claims			1
but now it faces further problems after users began complaining the @entity0 have started randomly showing adverts during the middle of movies			1
@entity20 users have complained their sets have started showing a @entity23 advert while watching movies on the @entity24 , and @entity26 apps			1
the advert covers half the screen and disrupts the film			0
@entity1 told @entity29 it is making an investigation into the fault its ' top priority ' concerns about the adverts appeared on monday by users of the @entity37 tv app @entity24 , available on @entity1 smart tvs , reports @entity39			1
one user wrote : ' after about 15 minutes of watching live tv , the screen goes blank and then a @entity23 advert - taking up about half the screen - pops up and stops @entity24 playing			1
' it 's as if there is a popup ad on the tv			2
i have not installed any other software or apps			0
' the same issue was also reported by at least five other people on a separate thread			0
it was initially thought to be a problem with the @entity24 app , but another forum member said he did n't have @entity24 installed on his @entity1 tv but was experiencing the same issue			1
furthermore , a @entity59 said they had also been shown a @entity23 advert while watching films on the @entity26 app on their @entity20			1
earlier this week , @entity1 was criticised over claims its smart @entity0 can capture ' personal or other sensitive ' conversations ( policy extract pictured ) @entity67 wrote on monday that they had been using @entity26 for two months and the advert had never appeared before			1
' every movie i play , 20 to 30 minutes in , it plays the @entity23 ad			0
it has happened on six movies today			0
' on the @entity24 thread , a company employee responded : ' this absolutely should not be happening and has been escalated immediately			2
' @entity1 told @entity29 : ' we are aware of a situation that has caused some smart tv users in @entity37 to experience program interruption in the form of an advertisement			1
' this seems to be caused by an error , and we are currently conducting a full and thorough investigation into the cause as our top priority			1
' we would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by our customers			0
' earlier this week , @entity89 highlighted a line in @entity1 's smart tv privacy policy that suggested its voice recognition technology has the potential to listen to conversations and capture ' personal or other sensitive information '			1
following the news , @entity97 activist @entity96 tweeted that the @entity1 terminology is similar to an excerpt from @entity102 's dystopian novel 1984			2
the wording of the policy concerned privacy campaigners and @entity97 activist @entity96 tweeted @entity1 's terminology was similar to an excerpt from @entity102 's 1984 ( shown ) at the time of the initial claims , a @entity1 spokesman told @entity29 it takes consumer privacy very seriously and that ' any data gathering or their use is carried out with utmost transparency			1
the firm has since posted a blog post further clarifying that its smart @entity0 ' do not monitor living room conversations ' at the time of the initial claims , a @entity1 spokesman told @entity29 it takes consumer privacy very seriously and that ' any data gathering or their use is carried out with utmost transparency '			1
the firm has since posted a blog post further clarifying where it stands on the issue			2
' @entity1 smart tvs do not monitor living room conversations , ' said the firm			1
voice recognition lets the user control the tv using voice commands			0
it has to be activated in the first instance , and can be deactivated at any time			0
@entity1 ' listens ' for voice commands and then sends them , along with information about the device , to a company called @entity142			2
this service converts speech to text and the tv uses this text to search for content or carry out a task , for example			0
in addition , @entity1 said it may collect and capture voice commands and associated texts for future use , so it can improve the features			2
once enabled , @entity1 told @entity29 that the voice data only consists of tv commands , or search sentences , only			1
users can recognise if the voice recognition feature is activated because a microphone icon appears on the screen			0
a spokesman continued that @entity1 does n't sell voice data to third parties and the voice data is sent to a server , which searches for the requested content then sends it to the tv			1
he did not explain what happens to the captured data once it is no longer needed , and @entity29 has contacted @entity1 for further information			1
it continued that language used in the policy - particularly the line : ' please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information , that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of @entity181 - has led to confusion			1
to clarify its position , @entity1 explained : ' if you enable @entity181 , you can interact with your @entity185 using your voice			2
' to provide you the @entity181 feature , some voice commands may be transmitted to a third - party service provider ( currently , @entity142 ) that converts your interactive voice commands to text			0
' in addition , @entity1 may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with @entity181 features and evaluate and improve the features			0
' and the firm stressed that it only collects voice commands when users make a specific search request to the smart tv by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on their screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control			1
if people do n't enable the feature , they ca n't use the interactive features , but users can disable recognition data at any time in the @entity215 menu			0
@entity1 has still not explained what it does with the data it collects , and how long it keeps it for			2
plus , at the time of writing , it has n't updated the wording of the privacy policy to make this clearer			2
yesterday , @entity224 's xbox console was among other devices accused of snooping on users			0
@entity228 - controlled xboxes listen to everything around them , silently waiting for commands such as ‘ xbox on ’ or instructions to play games including @entity235 or @entity236			0
the technology means people can play games or watch catch - up tv without using the remote control			0

in 2012 , @entity265 - based security firm @entity264 posted a video showing how its researchers had learned to crack a @entity1 television to access its settings - including any personal information stored on it			2
with such malware installed , hackers could use the tv 's built - in microphones and camera to hear and see everything in front of it			0
last summer , a which ? investigation then discovered just how much data the manufacturers can gather			0
experts monitored streams of data coming from 2013 and 2014 models of smart tvs made by @entity287 , @entity1 , @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290			2
all the brands tracked people ’s viewing habits to some extent , and users had agreed to this when they accepted the @entity0 terms and conditions			0
