@entity8 , from @entity9 , increased to a size 24 in four years after meeting her ex because he told her he thought curves were more attractive			1
the 5ft 4ins 26 - year - old was devastated when she discovered he 'd been cheating on her with at least eight other women - and none of them were overweight			1
weight gain : @entity8 was a size 12 when she first met her ex , left , and put on 7st during their four year relationship becoming a size 24 , right @entity8 said : ' i was shocked that he had been unfaithful but the biggest smack in the face was the fact that all the other women were thin			1
' i expected them all to be big girls like me because i thought that was his type			2
when i saw they were all really slim it did n't make sense			2
' when he admitted they were his type and that he 'd gone off big girls i was mortified			0
i 'd got so fat because i thought he preferred it when all the time he was going behind my back with thin girls			2
' @entity8 weighed 10st 7lbs when she first met her ex - who we can not name - through friends			1
' i thought he adored my curvy body ' : @entity8 was 17st at her heaviest but her boyfriend told her not to worry about her weight the couple would enjoy having nights in together eating takeaways four times a week			1
as @entity8 's waistline began to expand , she expressed concern over their unhealthy diet but he would tell her not to worry about her size			1
she said : ' my mum gently suggested i should lose some weight but when i told my boyfriend he assured me i looked great and not to worry			1
' he was always saying that celebrities had got it so wrong because men hated really skinny girls and loved real curves			0
when i put on weight he told me i looked sexier so i got the impression that it was the bigger the better			1
' ' i had spent the past four years eating everything thinking that he adored my curvy body when all the time he was slowly going off me ' after they had been together four years , she had ballooned to a size 24 and 17st			1
' i knew i was obese but told myself that as long as my partner fancied me , what did it matter ? we were happy so i did n't need to worry what other people thought , ' @entity8 said			1
but then her happiness was shattered when she got a call from a friend warning her that her man was cheating			2
' i confronted him and he told me it was utter rubbish			2
i believed him and told my friend not to call me again , ' she said			2
but as time passed @entity8 began to grow suspicious			1
she said : ' he was going out on his own and started switching his phone off			0
i noticed he said his battery was dead quite a lot which seemed odd			0
' after he started receiving texts in the middle of the night , @entity8 decided to check his phone			1
' i decided to do a bit of snooping to put my mind at rest and logged onto his @entity104 page			0
i scrolled through the timeline and there was a photo of my boyfriend which had been tagged ' my baby ' by a woman i did n't know			0
i posted a comment saying " who 's baby ? " diet starts here : she decided to lose weight after discovering her man had been cheating and is now a size 8 , weighing 9st , right minutes later she received a private message from the woman asking @entity8 how she knew him			1
when @entity8 replied that he was her long - term boyfriend , she was shocked when the woman replied saying she was his girlfriend too			1
at first she did n't want to believe it : ' i convinced myself she was lying and just jealous because she fancied him			0
' ' i was angry with him , but i was angry with myself too			0
i had left myself go and i vowed to lose the weight ' but then she found eight @entity104 messages from different women all claiming to be dating her boyfriend			1
she confronted her man and was appalled when he admitted he had been cheating			2
but she was even more shocked when she looked at the profile pictures of the women he had seen behind her back			1
' i wanted to know why he had cheated			0
i expected them all to be big girls like me because that was his thing			0
but they were all skinny minnies			0
it did n't make sense , ' she said			0
when she asked him why , he told her he ' used to like big girls but now preferred skinny women			1
' ' he might as well have slapped me in the face , i was gutted , ' @entity8 recalled			1
' i had spent the past four years eating everything thinking that he adored my curvy body when all the time he was slowly going off me			2
moved on : @entity8 was 10st 7lb , left , when she met her ex before gaining weight			1
now she 's slimmest she has ever been , right , and was n't interested when her ex wanted her back ' i was angry with him , but i was angry with myself too			0
i had left myself go and i vowed to lose the weight			2
' @entity8 joined a gym and overhauled her diet			1
she said : ' before i 'd have a sausage and egg sandwich for breakfast followed by stacks of biscuits and a carton of fruit juice mid-morning before tucking into a jacket potato piled with cheese and coleslaw for lunch			2
then a takeaway with bread and butter for dinner , as well as chocolate bars and packets of crisps as i watched tv in the evening			1
' instead i ate fruit for breakfast , a salad for lunch and chicken and vegetables for dinner			2
snacks were out and i only drank water			0
' using revenge against her ex as her motivation , she stuck with her diet and exercise regime and the weight began to fall off until she was a slim size 8 , weighing nine stone			1
' my confidence started to grow			0
i noticed other men seemed interested in me and stopped thinking about my ex so much , ' she said			0
confident : @entity8 is now a size 8 after cutting out junk food and joining a gym @entity200 , weight 17st : breakfast : sausage and egg sandwich lunch : jacket potato piled with cheese and coleslaw dinner : takeaway with bread and butter followed by chocolate bars and packets of crisps snacks : stacks of biscuits and a carton of fruit juice @entity219 , weight 9st breakfast : fruit lunch : salad dinner : chicken and vegetables snacks : none , drank water but then she bumped into him at a party and had the chance to show him what he was missing			1
' he was staring at me and i noticed he was looking me up and down			0
but it was n't until our eyes met that he looked shocked and it twigged it was me			2
' ' he walked over and i laughed and said to him " you did n't recognize me did you ? " he admitted he had n't and told me i looked amazing			0
' he asked me if i fancied going out some time			0
once i would have done anything to hear those words but i suddenly realised i just did n't care anymore			0
' i said " no thanks " and walked away			0
knowing his eyes were on my size eight bum as i walked off was the best feeling in the world			0

it was the best thing he ever did for me because i have honestly never been happier			0
