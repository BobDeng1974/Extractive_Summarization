@entity0 has been removed from @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 after deacons voted *unanimously* to oust him
in a sermon in september , he revealed he had contracted @entity23 in 2003 and was diagnosed with @entity6 in 2008 - and the congregation was supportive
but in later sermons he revealed he had taken cocaine , misused church funds and had sex with members of the congregation in the church
he knew he had @entity6 at the time but it is not clear if he told all of the women he had the disease ; at least one said she is getting checked
since being ousted , @entity0 has changed the locks on the church
