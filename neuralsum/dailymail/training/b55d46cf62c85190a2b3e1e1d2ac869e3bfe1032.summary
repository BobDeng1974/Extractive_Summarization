@entity0 is confident @entity1 will not be sidetracked by the continuing row over @entity4 's conduct , suggesting his altercation with @entity7 all - rounder @entity6 ' got blown out of proportion '			1
the row between @entity4 and @entity6 during the first @entity10 at @entity11 is still casting a shadow as the series enters its fourth match at @entity15 on thursday			1
the issue appeared to reach a conclusion last week when both players were cleared by independent @entity20 commissioner @entity19 , @entity4 having been charged with a level three offence of pushing and abusing @entity6 , who escaped a lesser charge			1
low key : @entity0 believes the @entity4 and @entity6 row has been blown out proportion back among the runs : @entity0 hit 167 in @entity1 's previous test with @entity7 at @entity28 but while @entity1 are happy to let the situation lie , @entity7 have repeatedly registered their dissatisfaction with @entity4 's behaviour and would like to see further action			1
only the @entity20 chief executive @entity33 can now extend the process , by appealing @entity19 ' verdict , and an official statement from the governing body confirmed the @entity39 's ruling was under consideration ahead of sunday 's deadline			1
but @entity0 has been surprised by the furore having occurred during a series that he believes has been low on antagonism			2
' apart from one incident there 's been nothing on the field at all , less than in other series i 've played , ' said @entity0			1
' it 's a tough environment in the middle , there 's always a bit and you hope it does n't go past the line , but it 's been played in a good spirit			0
' certainly a lot has been made of that issue			0
but like i said , from what i 've been part of , there 's been very little said apart from that one incident			2
' fourth test awaits : @entity0 ( left ) takes part in a nets session with @entity67 ( centre ) and @entity69 shake on it : @entity6 ( left ) and @entity4 shake hands during a series which has seen a feud develop between the pair following a row during the first test the issue certainly had no effect on @entity4 's performance during @entity1 's series levelling win at the @entity81 last week , the 32 - year - old claiming match figures of seven for 77			1
having escaped a potential ban for his home @entity10 , @entity4 now has the opportunity to make @entity7 pay once again and @entity0 thinks he is primed to deliver			1
' from @entity88 's point of view , and the players who were involved in it ( the hearing ) , they 'll do what they 've done over the past couple of weeks , put that aside and concentrate on the cricket , ' he said			0
' the way @entity88 handled everything , to get man of the match at @entity28 with everything around the corner afterwards , was an incredible effort			0
i 'm sure he 'll do exactly the same here , as will all the players			0
i 'm sure we 're desperate to get everyone talking about the cricket and a good series , rather than one incident that maybe got blown out of proportion			2
' @entity0 is one of @entity1 's least confrontational figures , though he is no stranger to being on the sharp end of a few well - placed barbs			1
intimidated : @entity0 ( centre ) admits being affected by @entity117 's verbal barbs during the 2005 ashes he was ruthlessly targeted by @entity117 during his maiden @entity118 series in 2005 , and memorably nicknamed the ' @entity120 ' after the @entity122 character of the same name			1
@entity0 admits that episode of ' mental disintegration ' had an effect on him but would not have it any other way			2
' we 've all copped it , we 've all said things , we 've all received things along the way , ' he said			0
' there 's always a bit of banter when it 's @entity1 - @entity136 and it should continue that way			2
' test cricket is a tough environment and sometimes you have to earn your respect			0
certainly for me as a young player , i got taught a lesson by one of the best of all time ( @entity117 )			2
' he noticed i was a young player , he put pressure on me to affect my performance and he did			0
i learned a massive lesson on how i needed to adapt to those situations			0
' that 's how it should be			0
you would n't want it to be easy out there			0
