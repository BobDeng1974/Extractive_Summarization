by @entity0 a homeowner has taken one of the @entity4 energy giants to court and won after they repeatedly harassed and threatened him for money he did n't owe			2
in a @entity10 style legal battle , people 's champion @entity7 , 62 , represented himself against @entity11 in his second case against an energy firm in four years			1
he won £ 3,000 in total in compensation for the trouble they caused him			1
the 62 - year - old 's problem with @entity11 started when tenants living in his late mother ’s house , which he rents out , moved out in july 2013 leaving an outstanding bill of £ 450			1
he sued them and took them to the county court and won mr @entity7 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , then began receiving letters from @entity11 demanding the outstanding money be paid , despite the fact the debt was n’t his			1
he began receiving disconnection notices followed by demands from debt collectors			0
by this point mr @entity7 had spent hours of time on the phone arguing his case and asked @entity11 to compensate him by £ 80 for the hassle			1
when the energy giant failed to meet his request mr @entity7 summonsed them for approximately £ 450			1
@entity11 failed to turn up to represent themselves in court and mr @entity7 won the case			1
it was mr @entity7 's second court battle against a @entity4 energy firm in the last four years @entity11 failed to pay so in may mr @entity7 instructed the sheriffs to redeem the compensation awarded to him through the courts mr @entity7 eventually recovered the compensation he was owe after @entity59 intervened no one turned up at @entity61 at the hearing in january 2014 to represent @entity11 so the case was granted in mr @entity7 ’s favour and the firm duly paid him the £ 450 he had requested in compensation			1
he said : ' it all went quiet and then i popped around to my mother ’s house , which was still empty , and there was a letter from the bailiff ’s demanding around £ 450 owed to @entity11 and it said i was due to attend court on that same day			1
' i had a big job on that day and had to cancel it to go to court			0
when i arrived at @entity78 i was informed the case had been written off the previous day and the @entity11 had failed to inform me			2
' i had lost earnings and was furious with the hassle and stress @entity11 were putting me through so i summonsed them for £ 2,500			2
' once again @entity11 failed to turn up to represent themselves in court and mr @entity7 won the case			1
this time @entity11 failed to pay so in may he instructed the sheriffs to redeem the compensation awarded to him through the courts			1
the enforcement officers turned up at @entity11 ’s head offices in @entity92 demanding the money or threatened to take equipment amounting to that sum and after further stalling the red - faced company finally coughed up			2
mr @entity7 , who took on @entity97 under similar circumstances four years ago and won £ 2,000 in a landmark case against them for time wasting , said : ' what is disgraceful is that they are quite happy not to turn up to these hearings and pay the compensation because they know that money will just come by increasing bills for other customers			1
' they are bullies and there is nothing a bully hates more than being bullied back			1
i feel like , in this i have given them a bloody nose and more people should be doing the same by standing up to them			0
' i studied law very briefly and was in low level local government many years ago so i have a slight grasp enough to stand up for myself in court but not much more than your average person			0
following @entity7 's court battle with @entity97 in 2010 , consumer experts told customers that they should keep detailed records of telephone calls made and letters sent to broadband , gas or electricity companies			1
if the customer is forced to spend serious amounts of time sorting out problems caused by the companies , they should attempt to bill them for loss of earnings			0
mr @entity7 was paid more than £ 2,000 by @entity97 after he threatened the company with court action following two years of disputes			1
mr @entity7 was about to take the energy company to the @entity61 following claims they miscalculated his bills , sent debt collectors to his home for money he did n't owe and sent his mother a letter asking her to sign up with them – after she had died			1
he logged every phone call he made and every letter he sent to @entity97 during working hours , then billed them for his loss of earnings , to demand the £ 2,108 sum at court			2
' @entity11 have sent me bills for the same periods for different amounts , demanding money i did n’t owe , threatening me and harassing me			2
' they are one of the most complained about companies in the country			0
@entity166 are weak about putting any sort of pressure on them to raise their standards			0
' it takes people like me standing up to them because they should n’t get away with treating people , their customers , like this			0
' energy companies rely on people giving in but it is worth the aggravation because now , thanks to @entity11 and @entity97 , the compensation i have received will cover my energy bills for the next few years			2
' a spokesman for @entity11 , who according to which ? have an average of 83 complaints per 1,000 customers , said the case was not defended to avoid causing any further inconvenience			0
they added the company paid the money but were not aware that mr @entity7 had not received it before an enforcement officer arrived			2
the spokesman said : ' it was thought the matter had been resolved to mr @entity7 ’s satisfaction , until without any notice , an enforcement officer attended our head office			2
' if he had notified us that he had not received the payment it would have not been necessary for him to instruct the enforcement officer			0
' energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			0
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			0
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0

@entity7 's tenants left a house he rents out leaving £ 450 in bills
@entity11 then started harassing the 62 - year - old for the cash they owed
so , he took @entity11 to court , representing himself against the energy giant
mr @entity7 , from @entity28 , won and was awarded £ 3,000 compensation
but @entity11 did n't pay up , so he had to instruct sheriffs to redeem it
he said : ' there is nothing a bully hates more than being bullied back '
mr @entity7 also won £ 2,000 from @entity97 in a similar case in 2010
