@entity0 is feared to be behind a hacking attack on computer systems controlling @entity4 nuclear power stations @entity5 is suspected of being behind a hacking attack on computers controlling south @entity4 nuclear power stations , sparking fears @entity0 may be planning a terror strike			1
computer systems at @entity11 ( @entity12 ) were successfully accessed last week with many immediately suspecting @entity5 to be responsible			1
@entity12 and the government said only ' non-critical ' data was stolen by the hackers , and that there was no risk to nuclear installations , including the country 's 23 atomic reactors			1
however @entity12 has ordered two days of safety drills at the nuclear plants to ensure their safety in the event of a successful hacking attack			1
the hacking was reported as the @entity29 accused @entity5 of a devastating cyberattack on @entity31			0
experts voiced alarm that the controls of the nuclear reactors could be at risk			2
' this demonstrated that , if anyone is intent with malice to infiltrate the system , it would be impossible to say with confidence that such an effort would be blocked completely , ' said @entity44 - yull of @entity45			0
' and a compromise of nuclear reactors ' safety pretty clearly means there is a gaping hole in national security , ' said @entity44 , who specialises in nuclear reactor design			2
@entity5 is believed to be employing an elite team of computer geniuses in a shadowy department known as @entity56 to hack into vulnerable systems in enemy states			0
the @entity4 government is investigating but has not said who might be responsible			0
in 2013 , @entity4 accused the @entity5 of a series of cyberattacks on banks and broadcasters			2
anti-nuclear activists in @entity4 have also protested against the use of nuclear power			1
@entity4 's energy ministry said it was confident that its nuclear plants could block any infiltration by cyber attackers that could compromise the safety of the reactors			1
an official at the country 's nuclear plant operator @entity12 , which is part of state - run @entity97 , told @entity91 that the hacking appeared to be the handiwork of ' elements who want to cause social unrest '			0
he said he had no one specific in mind and did not elaborate			0
' it is 100 per cent impossible that a hacker can stop nuclear power plants by attacking them because the control monitoring system is totally independent and closed , ' the official said			2
the plants operators and the government said only ' non-critical ' data was stolen by the hackers , and that there was no risk to nuclear installations , including the country 's 23 atomic reactors they also said they could not verify messages posted by a @entity125 user claiming responsibility for the attacks and demanding the shutdown of three ageing nuclear reactors by thursday			1
the post also asked for money in exchange for the leaked data			0
the user who was described in the posting as chairman of an anti-nuclear group based in @entity137 said more documents from the nuclear operator will be posted if the reactors are not closed .			0

computer systems controlling 23 nuclear power stations hacked last week
operators said only non-critical data was stolen and there was no risk
but @entity4 still carries out series of *emergency* safety drills
