comedian @entity0 has boasted that he could drink ‘ @entity1 under the table , as he steps up his election campaign against the @entity5 leader			1
the ‘ @entity10 ’ announced last week that he will stand against mr @entity1 at the next election , potentially taking crucial votes off the @entity5 leader in his bid to unseat the @entity9			1
he has now unveiled a series of comedy policies for his newly - formed political party ‘ @entity13 ’ – the @entity14 – including renaming benefits ‘ scrounge credits ’ , turning off the internet at the weekend and making the rock band @entity18 play the national anthem ‘ at all state occasions ’			1
@entity28 if you come to @entity30 and it 's neither an accident nor an emergency , then you will be sent to a random hospital department to be practised on			2
@entity34 @entity35 has been too quiet for too long			2
immigration the reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world			2
the only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse			2
@entity48 @entity49 to be bought and operated by @entity50			0
someone to do the bins at least			0
@entity52 unemployment causes crime : i propose to lock up the unemployed			0
@entity0 will stand in @entity23 , @entity24 - the seat targeted by mr @entity1 in his bid to finally enter @entity58			1
explaining his decision to stand last week , the @entity60 - educated comic said : ' it seem to me that the @entity63 is ready for a bloke waving a pint around , offering common sense solutions			1
' he pledged to ' lock up the unemployed ' , run @entity49 from @entity50 and revalue the pound at £ 1.10 so it will be ' worth 10p more '			0
but today @entity0 has gone further - promising nationalise all pubs and make it illegal to call casseroles with pastry lids ‘ pies ’			1
asked who would win in a three - way lager - off – you , @entity78 or @entity1 ? – he said : ‘ these men are amateurs			1
' he added : ' the drinking itself would n’t be a challenge – in fact , i ’d say there is n’t a table in the land i could n’t drink them under			0
‘ no , it ’s the company that would be an issue			0
you ’d have @entity1 pretending he ’s not a public - school stockbroker and actually some sort of man of the people – and what sort of muppet pretends to be someone they ’re not , eh ? ‘ i ask you			1
and then @entity78 droning on and on about the time he met @entity100			0
’ asked about protecting people from ‘ snooping ’ security agencies , he added : ‘ personally , i think it would be good for the country if we turned off the internet at 5pm on friday and only turned it back on on monday morning			0
‘ there would be no more drunk tweeting , no more vengeful emails to the ex , impulse purchases on @entity111 ( or whatever right - on site you lot use at the @entity115 ) , no more having to use in private browsing or whatever it ’s called as you cry lonely tears in your bedsit			2
’ @entity0 also promised to make rock band queen ‘ play the national anthem at all state occasions ’ and ‘ change the name of benefits to @entity127 ’			1
in a video posted online he explained : ' let it be known that like many of the @entity132 hopefuls in the forthcoming election , i have no idea where @entity23 is - but did that stop @entity136 from saving the @entity137 ? no. ' @entity0 , 46 , is standing in a constituency which the @entity139 won from @entity140 at the previous election in 2010			1
it is already the focus of huge attention due to mr @entity1 's decision to stand there as @entity5 experiences a surge of support and now has two parliamentary seats			1
his party took 5.5 per cent of the votes in the seat five years ago			2
the @entity10 took a dig at mr @entity1 , explaining his decision to stand			1
he said : ' it seem to me that the @entity63 is ready for a bloke waving a pint around , offering common sense solutions ' @entity0 will stand for @entity58 for the @entity14 ( logo , above ) his decision to stand comes two years after fellow comic @entity161 - known for his character @entity163 - handed in nomination papers to stand in a by - election at @entity166 , for @entity168 's former seat			1
he went on to withdraw later the same day			0
other proposals include his pledge on law and order : ' unemployment causes crime : i propose to lock up the unemployed			0
' and on the hot topic of immigration , he says : ' of course the reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world			0
the only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse			0
' however , in the meantime , we brick up the @entity193			0
probably have to get some @entity195 in to do it			0
' in his online address , @entity0 explains : ' the reason i 'm standing is because the system is broken , we all know it is			2
you hear people saying ' you should n't vote '			0
well you should vote boys and girls , you should vote for me			0
' he also promises ' 1p a pint ' , although ' crisps will remain at the current price '			0
the party 's logo features an upturned pound sign , in a clear parody of the @entity5 symbol			2
mr @entity1 's team appeared unconcerned about the threat posed by @entity10			1
a spokesman for the @entity5 leader said : ' at last , serious competition in the constituency			1
' age : 46 born : @entity223 , @entity224 family : father : colonel @entity227 ; great - great grandfather @entity228 education : @entity230 ( boarding ) , @entity60 private life : twice married , father of two @entity233 : ‘ where would we be without rules , eh ? that 's right , @entity237			1
and where would we be with too many rules ? @entity35 ’ age : 50 born : @entity241 , @entity24 family : father : stockbroker @entity244 education : @entity247 ( private ) private life : twice married , father of four @entity233 : ‘ we would n't want to be like the @entity252 , would we ? that would be awful ! we 'd be rich ! ’			2
