by @entity0 last updated at 5:13 pm on 16th january 2012 a ten - year - old blighted by blood cancer has been given new hope , after a one - in - a - million bone marrow donor match was found in @entity5			1
@entity6 was diagnosed with leukaemia 18 - months ago , after experiencing breathlessness , tiredness and loss of appetite			1
following chemotherapy doctors gave him the all clear last january but months later the disease returned and he was told that he urgently needed a stem cell transplant			1
new hope : nine - year - old cancer patient @entity6 with mother @entity15 , sister @entity16 and father @entity17 in a desperate attempt to find a donor his family teamed up with a local charity to organise a recruitment drive in @entity23			1
@entity6 's 16 - year - old sister @entity16 , was also tested - siblings stand a 25 per cent chance of being a match - but the results were negative			1
now after a near global search , scouring registers in the @entity31 and abroad , experts located a perfect donor match in @entity5 and a bone marrow transplant is scheduled for february 16			1
his mother @entity15 , 46 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ' i feel a lot more positive now that we know it ’s definitely going ahead			0
' i felt excited when they told me , but i ’m apprehensive at the same time			0
' at least we ’ll be going in the right direction			0
as parents , we want a 100 per cent chance			0
but , failing that , we ’ll take whatever we can get			0
' a picture of @entity6 before the blood cancer struck @entity6 was diagnosed with leukaemia in june 2010 and treated at @entity53 ’s @entity52 , which has a specialist children ’s cancer ward for youngsters from across the region			1
in the first few months after diagnosis he had chemotherapy and was well enough to go back to school between treatments			2
then , in january 2011 , he was found to be clear of cancer but medics warned there was a high chance of the illness returning			0
he suffered a relapse in august and has since been given more chemotherapy using stronger drugs			2
he was even in hospital over @entity71 but was well enough to return home on @entity73 to celebrate his tenth birthday			0
the donor has been identified by experts at @entity77 , who will carry out the transplant next month			1
the procedure , which takes around one hour to complete and several days of preparation , has around a 60 per cent success rate			0
his mother added : ' we ’re not looking forward to seeing him so ill. we ’ve got our hopes up about the transplant but , at the same time , we ’re nervous because it will be so tough			2
' it ’s not just a case of having a transplant and there you go , you ’re cured			0
' the reality is that there ’s a long road ahead , so we ’re not celebrating			0
' during the transplant the donor 's blood will be removed through a vein in one arm , passed through a machine to separate the stem cells from other cells , and returned to the body through another vein			1
the aim is be to harvest healthy stem cells , which are found in the bone marrow , and create three important types of blood cells			0
the new stem cells will be given to @entity6 and take over the production of his blood cells			2
@entity15 added : ' once @entity6 goes to @entity116 , the first thing will be to give him five to seven days of chemotherapy , plus other drugs			2
' then he ’ll have the transplant , which will take a couple of hours , and then he could be in hospital for up to six weeks while he recovers			0
' after @entity6 goes home , he will need regular tests and will have to be home - educated for several months to avoid any risk of infection as his immune system will be lowered			1
in @entity130 and @entity131 , an estimated 2,700 new cases of leukaemia are diagnosed each year			2
it was reported last year that in @entity31 alone there were 1,600 people waiting for a bone marrow transfusion - out of a total 37,000 worldwide - and only half would find a suitable match .			1
