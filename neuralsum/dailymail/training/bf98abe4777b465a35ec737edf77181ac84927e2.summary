by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s summer of discontent is long forgotten and @entity5 is turning the club around , according to captain @entity7			1
the central midfielder has backed his manager to the hilt and believes the @entity3 are heading in the right direction after testing times			1
@entity5 ’s job had looked under threat towards the back end of last season , but there have been encouraging signs at the beginning of this campaign - not least during a demolition of @entity22 at @entity23 , which saw new signing @entity25 star in the 3 - 1 win			1
looking forward : @entity3 skipper @entity7 has backed @entity5 to succeed at @entity28 @entity30 viewing : @entity5 's job appeared under threat throughout last season and the summer all smiles : @entity7 was talking at the adidas # @entity35 live event on wednesday and any talk surrounding the 59 - year - old ’s potential departure is premature , says @entity7 , who applauded the club ’s decision to remain stable , particularly given the club have only been back in the @entity43 for two seasons			1
‘ he ’s a top man and has taken all the stick on the chin , going about his business the way he always does , ’ @entity7 told @entity45			1
‘ it ’s slowly turning back on his side now – especially after the way we played against @entity55 and @entity22 – and hopefully we can carry that on			2
‘ we ’re used to the manager and the way he works			0
obviously a lot was said about his job in the summer but he ’s fought through that and has come out the other side			1
‘ he ’s too experienced and been in the game for too long to allow that sort of stuff affect him			0
’ @entity7 freely admits that last season ’s finish of 13th was n’t good enough , but rejects the notion that @entity3 were n’t a decent side to watch – a chief complaint from a section of the support			1
all smiles : @entity7 celebrates with @entity74 ( right ) during the 3 - 1 win against @entity22 ‘ there were many times last year when we played really well , did n’t score and then got beat by the odd goal			1
that comes around to bite you , ’ he added			0
‘ no - one says how well you played – they just see the result			0
’ the summer addition of @entity25 , who scored at @entity22 last weekend , looks to have arrested the problems in front of goal – so severe that @entity89 ’s seven had him above everyone else in may			2
@entity92 has come in as a strikers ' coach – visibly delighted when @entity25 , @entity74 and @entity95 scored at @entity22 – with rewards reaped already			0
‘ it ’s been proven that @entity25 ’s a top player , ’ @entity7 said			1
‘ he ’s scored a lot of goals in different countries and hopefully the decision to bring him here pays off			0
he scored a brilliant goal on saturday and we ’re going to need him			0
hopefully we ’ll have a much better season			0
‘ he ’s a lovely fella			0
he ’s had a bit of bad publicity in the past for being quite temperamental but since he ’s been here he ’s been brilliant			0
’ @entity7 was speaking at the adidas # @entity111 event - the world ’s first real world event that combines gaming and football			2
to join the conversation follow @ @entity35 video our finishing was excellent - @entity5			2

@entity5 's job was under threat at @entity28 this summer
@entity3 look like impressing in the @entity43
