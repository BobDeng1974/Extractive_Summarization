in life grandmother @entity0 was a prolific texter , never more than an sms away from her nearest and dearest			1
so when she lost her battle with cancer at the age of 59 , her family decided to bury her with her mobile phone as a way of commemorating something they loved about her			1
to ease their grief they even sent her text messages with all the family news			2
but nothing could have prepared them for what was about to happen			0
@entity0 was buried with her mobile phone when she died so her family could text her as a way of dealing with their grief			1
but @entity22 ( pictured with her uncle @entity23 ) received a reply which said : i 'm watching over you			1
' the mysterious reply came more than three years after mrs @entity0 's death , despite @entity29 promising to put the phone number out of service mrs @entity0 , from @entity32 , died from bowel cancer in july 2011 at the age of 59 three years after mrs @entity0 had passed away in 2011 , her granddaughter @entity22 ’s blood ran cold when she received a return message			1
‘ i ’m watching over you , you ’ll get through this , you ’ll be all right , ’ the text read			2
miss @entity0 , 22 , a care worker from @entity32 , @entity40 , said : ‘ i felt sick when i read it , i was in shock			2
‘ obviously we know that @entity45 was n’t going to ever reply , it was just something we did as a comfort for ourselves because she loved to text			2
’ she also received another message which read : ‘ i ’m watching over you and it ’s all going to get better			0
’ ' i 'm watching over you , you 'll get thought this , you 'll be all right ' : ms @entity0 ( left ) received the reply a day after she sent a text to her dead grandmother ( right ) after @entity0 , pictured with her sons @entity55 and @entity23 ( right ) , died , network provider @entity29 promised the number she used would not be passed on to a new customer - but it was recycled and given to another phone user so miss @entity0 decided to investigate , and sent a response demanding to know who was responsible			1
eventually she received an apology from a man who had been given mrs @entity0 ’s number a few weeks previously when he signed up to mobile operator @entity65			1
he said he had started to receive texts from unknown phone numbers , and thought they were hoaxes from friends			0
to join in the fun , he responded – not realising the upset they were causing			0
after mrs @entity0 passed away , her son @entity55 said he received assurances from @entity29 that his mother ’s number would never be used again			1
mr @entity23 , from @entity79 , @entity40 , said : ‘ we are a big family of texters			0
if we ever fell out or had something to say , we ’d always send a message – that ’s why we buried her with her phone			0
‘ i ca n’t bear to visit @entity88 ’s graveside			0
for me it is a way to still feel connected to her			0
so to think someone else now has our @entity93 ’s number is just awful			0
we ca n’t believe @entity29 has done this			0
’ @entity29 said that when a number is disconnected , it is placed in a general pool for reuse and this should ’ve been explained			2
@entity29 is now liaising with @entity65 to try to retrieve the number for the family			1
as for the prankster , no one answered the phone yesterday			0
@entity23 rang his mother 's phone and spoke to a man who had been using the number for the last few weeks mrs @entity0 was buried in @entity108 , @entity32 , alongside her favourite possessions			1
