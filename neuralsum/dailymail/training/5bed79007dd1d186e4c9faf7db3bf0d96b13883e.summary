the 22 - year - old @entity8 international was allowed to travel to the @entity10 club for tests after @entity4 accepted an offer and he officially signed for the club on tuesday			2
@entity14 had also matched the fee and offered wages of around £ 42,000 a week but @entity2 bettered those terms and convinced the former @entity19 defender that a move to @entity21 , where he will figure alongside @entity6 , can propel him back into the international fold			1
new arrival : @entity0 has signed for @entity2 from @entity4 in an £ 8million deal excited : @entity0 said the prospect of playing with @entity6 convinced him to join the club boss : he also says the draw of returning to play with @entity31 once again was crucial to his decision survival : @entity0 says the main aim for the club is to ensure safety this season by reaching 40 points on the move : @entity0 has signed for @entity2 from @entity4 in an £ 8million deal defensive duo : @entity0 will play alongside @entity6 who has also signed for @entity2 @entity0 told the club 's official website : ' @entity31 was a big factor for me , having worked with him at @entity19			1
