between 16 and 18 june 1889 , @entity1 painter @entity0 created one his most famous works from the view out of an asylum window : the @entity5			1
debate on the masterpiece 's distinctive ‘ swirls ’ has raged ever since , with many saying they were extensions of his fragile state at the time			0
but now an artist has claimed that the spirals actually depict galaxies in the universe , and were likely inspired by drawings of the cosmos at the time			0
@entity20 artist @entity19 says the @entity21 inspired @entity0			1
the @entity1 painter created arguably his most famous work - @entity5 ( shown ) - in 1889 from the view out of his asylum window the claim was made by @entity20 artist and photographer @entity19 in his new book , @entity29 , reported @entity30			1
of particular interest , he says , is a drawing of the @entity21 - official designation @entity21 - by @entity36 astronomer @entity35 , 3rd @entity37 , in the mid 19th century			1
to observe the night sky , @entity35 built the largest telescope at the time - one with a mirror six feet ( 1.8 metres ) in diameter - with which he observed the galaxy and made his drawing			2
@entity0 was a @entity1 post-impressionist famous for his psychedelic landscapes and self - portraits			2
he painted @entity5 in 1889 , inspired by the view outside of his asylum in @entity50 , where he was being treated for a string of nervous breakdowns			2
one of his most famous works , @entity5 now hangs in @entity55 's @entity54 ‘ we believe that drawing led directly to @entity5 , the most famous artistic depiction of the night sky , ’ said mr @entity19			1
‘ either it was in the library of the asylum in the south of @entity50 , or he saw it in @entity65			0
’ at the time , @entity0 was in an asylum in @entity67 in @entity50 - and the painting is a depiction of his view out of the window			2
the technique of using swirls later appeared in many more of @entity0 ’s work - although whether they were inspired by the @entity21 drawing or not may never be known for sure			1
the @entity21 is about 23 million light - years away and is roughly the size of the @entity78 at about 60,000 light - years in diameter			0
interestingly , it was the first galaxy found to have a spiral structure - although at the time astronomers thought other galaxies were nebulae , not galaxies			0
it was not until 1922 that @entity20 astronomer @entity87 first proved that our galaxy was just one of many , many more in the universe			0
in 1850 , an astronomer depicted what a distant spiral galaxy might look like for the first time			1
@entity35 's @entity21 drawing ( shown ) may have inspired @entity0 , according to mr @entity19			1
at the time , though , it was thought this was a nebula , and not another galaxy the @entity21 is about 23 million light - years away and is roughly the size of the @entity78 at about 60,000 light - years in diameter			2
this image taken by the @entity104 shows the @entity21 ( @entity21 or @entity21 ) on the left , while the smaller object in the upper right is @entity108 or @entity108 the link between @entity35 's drawing and @entity0 's @entity5 is not completely new			1
in june last year , dr @entity111 , a @entity112 at @entity114 ’s @entity113 , provided his own context and insight into the connection in his book observing by @entity119			0
' the @entity21 can clearly be seen at the centre of @entity0 ’s @entity5 , which seems to have been inspired by the artist ’s knowledge of @entity123 , a @entity124 writer who popularised @entity35 ’s vision , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity123 described astronomical objects floating , as though “ lost in the depths of the sky ” , and was moved by the awe and terror they evoked “ even in a cold engraving ”			0
' @entity0 wrote of a similar sense of wonder shortly before he painted @entity5			0
' he paints the night sky as though newly discovered astronomical phenomena could be seen with the naked eye , expanding human imagination and perception by lending the viewer " telescopic eyes "			0

@entity20 artist @entity19 says the @entity21 inspired @entity0
the @entity1 painter created arguably his most famous work - @entity5 - in 1889 from the view out of his asylum window
but in 1850 , an astronomer had depicted what a distant spiral galaxy might look like for the first time
and @entity35 's @entity21 drawing inspired @entity0 , according to mr @entity19
