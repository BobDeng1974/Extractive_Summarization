by @entity0 @entity1 is set to pack the @entity2 with more cronies and failed politicians despite warnings the number of peers is set to top 1,000			1
constitutional experts have warned that handing dozens of political allies and donors is ‘ unsustainable ’ , but @entity12 sources said another list of appointments to the bloated second chamber is due within the next fortnight			1
@entity17 and @entity18 will also get the chance to send more peers to the lords despite criticism of places in the legislature for donors who have handed over millions of pounds in donations			0
packed full of peers : @entity1 is set to pack the @entity2 with more cronies and failed politicians despite warnings that the number of peers with the right to sit in the chamber is set to top 1,000 the list of around 20 new peers is expected to contain at least one @entity35 donor and around three @entity37 nominees			1
former energy minister @entity38 , an old ally of the prime minister , is among those tipped to enter the @entity2 – though not until the time of the next general election			2
mr @entity38 , one of the first mps to back mr @entity1 for the @entity45 leadership and a dogged campaigner against climate change , surprised colleagues by giving up his job voluntarily in last week ’s government reshuffle and announcing he is to stand down as an mp in nine months ’ time			2
@entity52 , the former universities and science minister , is thought to be another leading candidate to be handed a peerage when he too steps down at the next election			0
mr @entity1 is also said to have been lining up long - serving @entity45 home affairs adviser @entity58 to enter the @entity2 before he resigned after being arrested over alleged child porn offences			1
mr @entity58 has now been charged			0
all three parties have called for a smaller upper house , given that it is now larger than the entire @entity63			0
in the world , only @entity64 has a larger legislative chamber in the form of the @entity68			0
last summer , the three main parties appointed 30 more peers to the @entity2 , taking its membership to 836 – 200 more than the @entity72			1
the extra peers are costing taxpayers an estimated further £ 1.2 million a year			0
tipped : former universities and science minister @entity52 , left , and @entity38 , right , former minister for energy and climate change , are expected to be handed peerages when they step down as mps at the election peers themselves complain the chamber is intolerably overcrowded , with members competing for seats in the chamber and office space outside			0
they complain of a fractious atmosphere and warn that a rapid influx of new peers – particularly former mps – has had a negative impact on the @entity2 ' traditionally non-partisan ethos and courteous atmosphere			2
however , @entity12 sources say the prime minister will unveil a further list of appointments as part of a coalition deal to drastically alter the make - up of the upper chamber			0
tories and the @entity101 said on coming to power in 2010 that the chamber was unfairly dominated by hundreds of @entity37 peers			1
none can be removed unless they die , so the government says it needs to appoint scores of its own to shift the balance of power and help ensure the fair passage of legislation through @entity63			0
the last effort to reform the @entity2 , which would eventually have seen 80 per cent of peers elected and the numbers cut to 450 , foundered in 2012 after a rebellion by backbench conservatives and the refusal of @entity89 to cooperate			2
government sources they will not take lectures from @entity37 , which they say stuffed the @entity2 with ‘ duds and retreads ’ during its 13 years in power			1
@entity101 leader mr @entity17 has continued to make appointments to the @entity2 despite arguing the entire chamber should be abolished and replaced with an elected @entity2			1
senior @entity45 concede that their party ’s backbench rebellion against proposals to introduce a few dozen elected peers as a first step towards reform looks more and more foolish , since it prompted the @entity101 to block separate reforms to @entity134 constituency boundaries and cut the number of mps by 50 in 2015			1
that means the @entity45 will fight next year ’s election on boundaries heavily biased against them , meaning they need a poll lead of seven or eight points to be confident of a @entity134 majority .			0

more appointments to the @entity2 are due within the next fortnight
it comes after @entity45 and @entity101 complained it was dominated by @entity37
peers can not be removed until they die so to get parity they must add more
