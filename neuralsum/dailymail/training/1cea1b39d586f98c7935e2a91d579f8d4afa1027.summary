@entity0 clearly suffered when the spoof musical version of his apology for breaking his promise not to raise university fees was played on the @entity6 show			1
trying to laugh it off , he managed : ‘ it ’s catchy , very catchy			0
’ mr @entity0 has given permission for the track to be released in aid of charity			2
last night it was at 143 in the singles chart			0
but it was his decision to apologise for promising to block a rise in tuition fees – subsequently broken after the coalition was formed – which dominated the hour long session , during which he also revealed yesterday was his wedding anniversary			1
uppermost in people ’s minds was the idea that the hilarious remix of his ‘ sorry ’ video – in which he appeared to sing his apology – was set to make him the first cabinet minister to have a single in the top 40			1
questions about how @entity0 would celebrate if his remixed apology video topped the charts proved academic - the song by satirical website @entity50 only reached 143 @entity0 says i 'm sorry ( the @entity53 remix ) stormed up the @entity54 chart after its release on friday night , reaching number 35 ahead of the likes of @entity59 and @entity60			1
but when radio 1 dj @entity61 announced the official chart tonight , mr @entity0 was nowhere to be seen			2
based on record sales for the entire week , it seems the release of the @entity0 song late on friday night came too late to make an impression on the record - buying public			2
it scraped into the top 150 after the @entity0 leader gave permission to the track 's creator , satirical website www.thepoke.co.uk , to release it as a single			1
mr @entity0 told the conference : ' just when i thought life could n't get any stranger , a video of me gets remixed and becomes a @entity82 sensation			2
' all profits from the song 's success will be given to @entity86 , of which his wife @entity87 is a patron			1
the script held on to their number one slot with @entity90 despite a late challenge from @entity82 sensation @entity92 whose @entity93 climbed 13 places since midweek to land at @entity96			0
the established pop acts left the deputy prime minister trailing			0
mr @entity0 admitted he found the mocking remix of his tuition fees apology ' amusing ' as he defended the decision to say sorry two years after breaking the pledge to vote against any rise in university charges			1
@entity0 activists applauded when @entity0 announced it was the 12th anniversary of tyring the knot with @entity87 opinion in @entity109 was split over whether the apology was the right thing to do , with many activists still signed up to the idea of abolishing tuition fees			1
but mr @entity0 defended the apology , filmed at his home in @entity117 , south west @entity118			1
he told delegates in the conference hall : ' i hope with the passage of time more people reaise that the system which is coming into effect is not as pernicious as it was thought			0
’ but he was challenged by one activist who pointed out that before the 2010 general election mr @entity0 had promised the @entity0 would be the party that did not break promises , ‘ and then first thing we did was break a promise ’			2
whose round is it ? @entity0 gets the drinks in mr @entity0 insisted : ‘ to my dying day i firmly believe we did the right thing by going into government			2
’ he later stumbled on his words when referring to the economic plight of other @entity142 countries , telling the audience he mentioned @entity145 ’s woes in trepidation because his @entity145 wife @entity87 had just arrived			0
but he saved his strongest words to confirm his determination to block ' wild ' @entity151 demands for another £ 10billion to be slashed off the benefit bill after 2015			0
' i know there are some people in this hall who think that someone in government is itching to bite out bigger chunks of public spending during this spending review period , which extends from now till april 2015			0
' the @entity162 toasted their anniversary with soft drinks in the @entity166 , @entity109 he added : ' let me be really clear - we are going to stick to the spending plans			0
when we look for additional savings in the years ahead the @entity0 will start at the top and work ' what i can assure you is that we will not allow some of these wild suggestions that have been made from the right of @entity177 politics , that all the savings can be made from welfare			1
" let 's just scoop out a great £ 10 billion size hole for welfare "			0
no. ' nor will i accept some of the wilder suggestions that we should just wave a wand and say we 'll put a freeze on all benefits for two years across the whole piece			0

the @entity0 leader uses a question and answer session with activists to reveal he tied the knot 12 years *ago* today
hopes of becoming the first political leader in the top 40 are *dashed* when remix of his tuition fees apology only managed to reach 143
all proceeds from the single will go to @entity202 , which counts @entity87 as a patron
