but the 29 - year - old , who is taking part in the gruelling charity expedition , described how spirits were really high following the decision to suspend the competitive element of the trek			1
the @entity1 was part of a @entity16 group racing to the @entity3 against teams from the @entity18 and the @entity19			1
trek : walking with the @entity20 will see the participants trek to the @entity3			2
all 12 injured service personnel from @entity16 , @entity19 , @entity23 and @entity24 have overcome life - changing injuries and undertaken challenging training programmes to prepare themselves for the conditions they will face in @entity29 but the competition was stopped over the weekend after some of the adventurers , who include injured servicemen and women , became very tired after encountering difficult terrain			0
the three teams have now banded together and @entity1 said they were now just over three days from their goal			1
in a voice blog recorded in the frozen waste , he said : ' we are three and a half days from the @entity3			0
i think it is going to come all pretty quickly to us			0
we ’ve been out here now for about three and half weeks			0
' everyone is in really high spirits			2
the race obviously got cancelled a couple of days ago - a really good thing that has happened			2
' it is nice to see everybody intermingling with each other , not only every night because we camp together , but also during the day			0
' looking ahead to reaching their goal , @entity1 highlighted fellow adventurer @entity55 , who lost both his legs when an improvised explosive device blew up in his vehicle in @entity59 in 2009			1
' easy ' : @entity55 who lost both his legs when an improvised explosive device blew up in his vehicle in @entity59 in 2009			0
prince @entity1 said he was finding the trek ' a big enough challenge ' preparation : prince @entity1 making final preparations ahead of the start of the trek			1
prince @entity1 is part of the @entity16 team for the @entity3 expedition he said : ' everyone just ca n’t wait to get to the end			1
i think mixed emotions probably , i think some people , for instance @entity55 , double amputee , simply does n’t find walking to the @entity3 a big enough challenge , which is why he really enjoyed the race			0
' i think everyone back home will appreciate the fact that just being able to walk 100km ( 62 miles ) in these conditions with no legs is a pretty amazing feat in itself			0
' in total , 12 injured service personnel who have overcome life - changing injuries are taking part in the expedition organised by the charity walking with @entity92			2
trekking around nine to 12 miles ( 15km to 20km ) a day , the group have been pulling their 154lb ( 70kg ) sleds , known as pulks , towards the southernmost point on the globe			0
speaking about the conditions , @entity1 said : ' the weather is still holding off , which is really nice - it ’s about minus @entity100 ( minus @entity101 ) now and 24 - hour sunlight , which is nice in these tents to keep us warm at night			1
” difficult conditions but spirits are high : @entity1 said in video blog ' everyone 's spirits are really high ' prince @entity1 backed organisers who called off the race element of the trek for safety reasons			1
@entity1 and his fellow walking with the wounded expedition competitors began the race in temperatures of @entity119 , with a wind chill dropping it to @entity121 - and those conditions have continued			1
but with the fear that competitors were pushing themselves too hard in the harsh conditions the race element was called off at the weekend			0
@entity1 ’s team were leading the event which began last sunday - after it had been shortened by 37 miles because of the weather - inflicted delays			2
but on the fifth day of the challenge , as the teams arrived at their first checkpoint , it became ' obvious that underneath the concrete determination of all the team members , the harsh reality of the @entity29 was starting to take its toll , ' said the organisers in a statement .			0
