by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:49 est , 19 august 2012 updated : 15:11 est , 20 august 2012 @entity2 insisted today that honours will be given to gold medal - winning @entity5 athletes on merit rather than ' according to quotas '			1
with 43 athletes scooping gold at the @entity12 and more expected in the @entity13 , there has been speculation some could miss out in the @entity15			1
the most senior civil servant at the @entity17 cautioned at the weekend there would be no ' automatic gong ' for winning gold in the @entity12			0
campaign : supporters , politicians , and fellow sportsmen alike called for @entity25 to be honoured following his gold medal performance at @entity27 @entity28 said the sports honours committee - which makes recommendations for awards - would be looking to recognise those who ' put something back ' and showed a ' sustained effort ' as well as succeeding in their chosen event			1
no 10 today denied reports that new rules drawn up by the head of the @entity41 sir @entity40 - who chairs the main honours committee - meant there was a limit to the number of honours which could go to @entity48 ' honours are awarded on merit , not according to quotas , ' said the prime minister ’s official spokesman said			1
his comments appeared at odds with those of sports honours committee member @entity57 , however , who said they were restricted in the number of awards they could make			1
in a normal year , the former @entity13 gold medallist said , the committee would be restricted to one or two knighthoods , ' a few more ' cbes and between 45 to 50 @entity66 - the lowest tier in the honours system			1
she said there might be ' a little room for manoeuvre ' in the light of @entity48 ’s success , but that they were trying to ' manage expectation ' ahead of the publication of the @entity15 at the end of the year			1
national hero : @entity81 - winner @entity79 has had his chances of a knighthood rocked by recent revelations about honours rules ' we do have a limit on the numbers that we can award each year			1
i think that is where we are trying to manage expectation , ' she told @entity95 's today programme			2
' the sports honours committee ca n’t just give out 20 knighthoods or 20 dames			1
we have a number each year that we allocate			0
' although there might be a little room for manoeuvre with the success of this year ’s @entity5 and hopefully @entity13 , we are trying to manage expectation a little bit			1
' golden girl : heptathlete @entity108 became a national favourite after her @entity5 performance she said that gold medallists - who in the past might have expected an mbe as a matter of course - would have to be considered alongside those who had contributed through years of volunteering			0
' we ’d love to give out honours to absolutely everyone but i think the key is in the title - it ’s an honour , it ’s not an automatic reward , ' she said			0
' we are trying to balance achievement in sport against somebody who has maybe volunteered for a number of years			0
' officials were fighting a frantic damage - limitation exercise last night after mr @entity135 's comments amid fears some of @entity48 's champions will be snubbed			1
double gold medallist @entity79 's chances of a knighthood were rocked by claims that @entity141 officials on the @entity142 have imposed a quota of just one sporting knighthood a year			1
last night the man who masterminded @entity48 's record - breaking success urged them to junk the rules and give every gold medallist a gong			1
@entity151 , who has just quit as head of the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) , told the @entity154 : ' every single gold medallist has achieved both objectives			0
they have shown a lifetime of commitment and inspired a generation			0
' the sport honours committee is led by @entity164 , architect of @entity27			1
but his hands are tied by rules drawn up by sir @entity40			2
they must now ' take account how the candidate has used their profile for the benefit of the wider community and / or development of sport '			0
that could lead to ' a silver medallist who has competed at the highest level over a long period getting an award , when an 18 - year - old winning gold at their first competition might not '			2
contenders : @entity184 and @entity185 , both gold medallists at the @entity12 , are among those who could be honoured repeated success may also not lead to an upgrade of a previous award			1
under the plans , there is supposed to be just one sporting knight or dame , four cbes , 20 obes and 38 mbes from the world of sport			0
but the quotas take no account of the runaway success of the @entity12 , which saw 43 gold medallists in 29 events			2
that figure is expected to hit three figures once the @entity13 have finished			0
yesterday mr @entity28 defended the rules , saying : ' it 's the contribution over career and over a lifetime , it 's how that 's sustained , it 's whether you put something back			1
' but also all those behind the scenes : the volunteers , the organisers , the coaches , both at the elite level and at grassroots level			0
' he said the decisions would be taken by experts			0
' it 's chaired by @entity164 , it has other @entity223 and @entity13 on it like @entity57 and @entity225			2
i 'm sure they will not in any way underplay the achievement of our athletes			0
' the rules put the @entity142 on a collision course with the @entity153 , which is expected to nominate every gold medallist for an honour			2
they were rewritten this spring after criticism of the way 35 members of the @entity240 rugby set - up were honoured after the 2003 @entity242 win and the decision to give an mbe to every member of the @entity240 cricket team after they reclaimed the ashes in what is essentially a two - horse race in 2005			0
earlier this year , sir @entity40 told a committee of @entity252 that it ' no longer seems right ' that all @entity5 champions should get honours ' given the move away from “ automaticity ” in other fields '			2
@entity2 is backing at least four sporting knighthoods – @entity25 , @entity185 , @entity79 and @entity259			1
@entity260 is considered a shoo - in after becoming just the third @entity262 athlete – after sir @entity263 and sir @entity264 – to win four golds in as many games			2
@entity267 won his fourth gold this year and became the first @entity262 cyclist to win the @entity270 , while @entity259 ran both @entity48 's cycling team that won nine golds and @entity273 , which finished 1 - 2 in the @entity270			1
he has a @entity274 , so the next honour has to be a knighthood			0
former head of the @entity153 , @entity151 ( left ) has led calls for gongs for every gold medallist , but rules drawn up by chairman of the main honours committee , sir @entity40 ( right ) could affect the final decision in winning two gold medals on the track , @entity285 has matched the achievement of @entity289 in @entity290			1
a source close to the @entity142 hinted that @entity285 would get a gong : ' part of this is about community engagement and @entity79 runs a charity			2
he does a lot of charity work			0
' former sports minister @entity299 told the @entity154 : ' this is an extraordinary time			0
this @entity5 was a unique event for the country			0
' the rules should be relaxed for the @entity12			0
' a @entity305 source said ministers would push for as many gongs as possible .			0

some of @entity48 's 43 champions could be snubbed in @entity15
athletes must have shown ' sustained effort ' and ' put something back ' into the community to be considered
lord @entity164 's hands are tied by rules of main honours committee
repeated success may not lead to an upgrade of previous award
no 10 denies there is limit to the number of honours @entity48 can receive
but honours committee member said there were restrictions and ' little room for manoeuvre '
@entity2 is backing at least four sporting knighthoods – @entity25 , @entity185 , @entity79 and @entity259
