medieval men dug them to harvest medicinal salt , but today @entity5 ’s @entity4 salt mine complex has been turned into a theme park , with the help of some ingenious engineering			1
the deepest mine is 393 ft ( 120 metres ) below ground and while labourers previously chipped away at the salt before pulling it to the surface , now people can enjoy a ride on a ferris wheel or play mini golf , in the most spectacular surroundings			1
this image shows a ferris wheel in a stalactite - strewn cavern while it is possible that the mines near the city of @entity4 were first dug during @entity39 occupation , it is thought that they were founded shortly before 1075 after engineers stumbled across evidence of medieval tunnels in 1876			1
the first official document that mentions their existence was written by the @entity48 chancellery in 1271 and the mines ’ success grew from there			2
in the early years , a ‘ staircase of the rich people ’ provided access to the mines ' depths to observe the workers			1
to fix each step in place , labourers had to cut parallel slots in the wall			0
later , three wells were used to extract the salt and were expanded in the 19th century when table salt was still very much in demand			0
experts claim that microclimate in the mines also offers health benefits especially for people with respiratory difficulties			1
it has a constant temperature of around 12 ° c so people can be getting therapy , while having fun on boats or underground exhibits ( pictured ) a horizontal 3,008 ft ( 917 metre ) ‘ @entity78 ’ made transporting salt to the surface cheaper			1
now , the mine has been re-purposed for health and tourism			0
if you look closely you can see a playground at the bottom of this vertigo - enducing shot an octagonal room houses a winch called the crivac which was driven by horses to pull salt from the @entity95 mine to the surface			0

it is accessible from in impressive lift and visitors can take in the array of stalactites dangling from the ceiling , which grow at rate of one inch ( 2 cm ) every year , before they typically drop off when they reach of length of around nine ft ( three metres )			0

it is the only one of its kind in @entity100 the cone - shaped @entity166 mine is even deeper at around 393 ft ( 120 metres ) and it too is decorated with a bloom of stalactites			2
its focus is a shallow lake of salty water , up to 26 ft ( eight metres ) deep , which is peppered with rowing boats			1
there is an island in the centre , which was originally a heap of ‘ waste ’ salt that was never moved once the mine was shut down in 1880			1
above the surface , salt baths are taken as a health treatment , but the mine itself also offers respiratory benefits , according to the attraction ’s website			1
these benefits include a constant air temperature of 12 ° c and humidity between 73 to 80 per cent , which is believed to help respiratory problems			2
there are said to be ‘ virtually zero ’ allergens in the mines as well as pathogenic yeasts or fungi and @entity5 health workers claim it is good for asthma and bronchitis			1

the waters halve a high salt content – 10 percent at the surface and up to 28 per cent at depths of 98 ft ( 30 metres )			2

@entity5 ’s @entity4 salt mine complex was dug in medieval times to harvest medicinal salt
in the early years , the ‘ staircase of the rich people ’ provided access to the depths of the mines
*rudolpf* mine is deepest in the complex at 137 ft ( 42 metres ) , 196 ft ( 50 metres ) wide and 262 ft ( 80 metres ) long
it *'s* now been transformed into a theme park with a ferris wheel , miniature golf and a salty boating lake
@entity306 also offers health benefits especially for people with respiratory difficulties because of humidity
there are said to be ‘ virtually zero ’ allergens in the mines as well as pathogenic yeasts or fungi
