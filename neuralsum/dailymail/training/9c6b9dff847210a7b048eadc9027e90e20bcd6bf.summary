the fitter , happier looking @entity0 makes for a stark contrast to what has been seen of the star in recent times , most notably when he was pictured in a dazed state walking around @entity131 's @entity130 lobby wearing nothing but a towel			1

@entity0 ’s father @entity185 previously said the family staged a form of intervention to get the former sportsman into ‘ one of the best ’ rehab facilities in the world			2
three months since his return from the @entity174 and it appears that advice is paying off with former great now looking much healthier and happier after packing his bags in @entity131 and moving back to the two places it all began - the @entity4 and the pool			2
