@entity0 is facing gridlock this @entity2 weekend as engineering works on the railways will lead to long queues during the @entity7 getaway			1
as many as 16 million motorists are set to take to the roads over @entity2 , with four million travelling on @entity10 and 4.5 million on @entity11			2
disruption to the train lines coupled with the gloomy weather forecast , has meant @entity0 's roads will be even busier than usual for the @entity2 break			2
drivers could face travel misery this @entity2 as disruption to railways will see more people opt to use their cars more people are planning to drive because of works on the rail network and a surge in people travelling abroad to seek sunshine ' the first spring bank holiday of the year traditionally heralds the start of busier weekends on the nation 's roads , ' said @entity36 head of external affairs @entity34			1
he went on : ' this @entity2 is set to be a hectic one with 16 million of us getting behind the wheel for an @entity2 break , but at least we will benefit from the longer days and lighter evenings to complete our journeys			2
' despite the surge in traffic , the @entity43 ( which becomes @entity44 on april 1 ) is maintaining 55 sets of roadworks over the @entity7 weekend			0
parts of the @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 likely to be hit by lane closures or speed restrictions			0
however , the agency said that 62 other roadworks would be temporarily lifted to ease the congestion			0
the increase in the number of people planning to travel by car is thought to have been in part triggered by a significant shutdown of the rail network			0
a string of engineering projects is expected to cause delays and overcrowding on some of @entity0 's busiest lines			0
work is planned on three key routes - the @entity74 main line , @entity75 and @entity76 - forcing passengers to make diversions on slower trains or spend hours on the dreaded replacement coaches			1
@entity81 said engineering works were planned over the @entity2 holidays because passenger numbers fell by 20 per cent			1
a spokesman told @entity86 : ' more than 90 per cent of the rail network is unaffected by our improvement work but a few lines are significantly impacted and passengers should check our website before travelling			0
' the work is designed to improve the railway delivering new facilities , new signalling , new bridges , new track and flyovers all to give passengers a better , more reliable railway			0
' this map shows the traffic hotspots , rail closures and delays that are due to take place this @entity2 weekend last @entity106 , thousands of passengers were crammed together outside @entity108 station , a small commuter stop in north @entity110 , in freezing conditions because @entity112 had failed to reopen in a move that has been described by an expert as ' adding insult to injury ' , @entity113 and @entity114 have cancelled advanced cheap fares forcing passengers to purchase more expensive off - peak tickets			1
both @entity113 and @entity114 say they can not offer advance fares as the tickets would not be valid with other operators and replacement services			1
a trip from @entity110 to @entity127 will cost £ 82 instead of the usual £ 15 advanced single ticket and take three hours , 53 minutes for a trip via @entity130 , compared to the usual two hours , eight minutes direct service			0
a journey from @entity110 to @entity132 will see passengers fork out £ 31.50 instead of £ 12 for a six - hour trip that involves four trains and a bus , instead of the normal direct service taking three hours , 16 minutes			0
@entity138 , of @entity140 consultants , told the @entity141 : ' it 's a rip - off			0
paying more for journeys taking longer adds insult to injury			0
' passengers should be entitled to reduced , not increased , fares when engineering works affect journeys			1
' a @entity113 spokesman said : ' all @entity2 weekend trains in and out of @entity152 to all destinations have not had usual discounted advance fares made available			1
' advance fares are only available on our services and due to the engineering works , there will not be any @entity113 services to travel on			1
' @entity114 said : ' we ’re unable to offer usual advance fares from @entity110 through the @entity162 , to @entity163 and @entity164 from @entity10 ; and from saturday lunchtime also for journeys from @entity163 to @entity132			2
' advance fares are for particular trains			0
engineering work means there is no way to put advance purchase fares on buses or alternative operators ’ services			2
' @entity176 , @entity114 's @entity178 services , has even encouraged passengers to avoid travelling this @entity2			1
he said : ' @entity114 will be running rail - replacement bus services over the @entity7 weekend , but journeys will involve changes and will take much longer than normal			1
' a string of engineering projects is expected to cause delays and overcrowding on some of the busiest lines last @entity106 , @entity188 , the chief executive of @entity81 , was forced to forego his annual bonus worth up to £ 135,000 after chaos on the railways caused by over-running engineering projects			1
thousands of passengers were crammed together outside @entity108 station , a small commuter stop in north @entity110 , in freezing conditions because @entity112 had failed to reopen			0
mr @entity188 said : ' our improvement programme this @entity2 is focused on delivering a better service for passengers			2
' we are acutely conscious that many people want to use the railway during the holidays , which is why the vast majority of the network is running normally over the holiday period - but there will be disruption for some			2
' i would like to apologise to any passengers whose plans are affected by our improvement work , but i hope they will understand that this is a quieter time on the railway and we want to minimise the overall impact of these vital projects on passengers			0
' the gloomy weather forecast this @entity7 weekend will increase the traffic on @entity0 's roads as travellers go abroad in search of sunshine			2
figures from @entity223 airport show that more than two million passengers are expected to fly off for foreign holidays over the @entity2 break - a four per cent rise on the same period last year			1
almost 50,000 more people than last year have bought air tickets for travel over the @entity2 weekend compared with last year			1
@entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 are the most popular destinations .			0

engineering works on railways will see long queues this @entity2 weekend
rise in traffic also result of people going abroad for last minute holidays
almost 50,000 more have bought air tickets compared with last year
@entity81 say works planned over @entity2 as numbers fall by 20 per cent
@entity113 and @entity114 have cancelled advanced cheap fares forcing passengers to purchase more expensive off - peak tickets
