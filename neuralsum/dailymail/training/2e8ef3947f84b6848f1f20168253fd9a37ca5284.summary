@entity4 arrives at the side entrance of @entity6 's @entity59 on wednesday @entity4 has suffered another injury setback to his thigh in training for @entity6 @entity4 was outstanding last season and his partnership with @entity18 was worth more than 50 goals for @entity6 , as they came within two points of winning their first title since 1990			1
but it has been a completely different situation this time around			0
though he scored the winning goal against @entity70 on the opening weekend of the new season , he has not kicked a ball for his club since their 3 - 1 win against @entity76 at the end of august			0
he was sidelined for six weeks after breaking down during an @entity12 training session and then , at the start of october , he damaged his calf just before he was scheduled to return			2
