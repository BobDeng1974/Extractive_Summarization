by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 06:46 est , 27 march 2013 chancellor @entity1 was forced to defend his mortgage scheme from claims it would push up house prices and help people buy second homes @entity10 plans to kick - start mortgage lending in a bid to boost growth will simply drive up house prices , the @entity9 watchdog warned yesterday			1
claims that the scheme to help first - time buyers and those trading up will lead to an increase in house building were dismissed by the @entity19			1
director @entity20 said it will simply raise prices while planning restrictions hold back house building			2
‘ i suspect that more of it would have showed up in prices than in quantities , ’ he said			0
chancellor @entity1 also faced claims from @entity29 on the @entity30 that his help to buy plans will simply fuel another house price bubble			1
@entity35 ’s @entity34 accused mr @entity1 of deliberately seeking to boost the property market so people feel better off but warned that would simply price more people out of the market			1
in last week ’s @entity41 , mr @entity1 outlined plans to help those who can not afford to put down a 20 per cent deposit on a property			1
from january , buyers will have to find 5 per cent with the government underwriting the other 15 per cent with a repayment when the home is sold			2
a separate scheme will see the government share equity with home buyers in new build properties			1
the @entity19 ’s @entity54 also gave a lukewarm welcome to the help to buy scheme			1
on the up : house prices have rise in almost all regions since the 2008 crash , most sharply in @entity62 and the @entity63 chancellor @entity1 last week promoted his house buying package on a visit to a development in @entity67 , south east @entity62 ‘ the key issue is , is it just going to drive up house prices ? ’ he told the @entity30			1
‘ by and large in the short run , the answer to that is yes			0
‘ in the medium term , will the increased house prices stimulate more house building ? and our general answer to that would probably be a bit , but the historical evidence would suggest not very much			2
‘ prices will go up and one would hope that that would impact on house builders , but probably not very much			0
’ but @entity84 @entity83 , the committee chairman , warned that he risked ‘ ploughing money back into the boom - bust property cycle ’ while the supply of housing will only ‘ increase later , if at all ’			0
@entity90 , director general of the @entity91 , @entity92 ’s biggest lobby group , has also raised his fears that the help to buy scheme could trigger fresh ‘ dangers ’ of a house price ‘ bubble			2
’ quizzed by the @entity29 , chancellor repeatedly refused to say whether he thinks house prices will rise			0
@entity19 chairman @entity20 said there was little scope in the planning system to build more homes so the mortgage scheme was likely to force up house prices ‘ i do n’t detect that we ’re in the middle of a housing boom , ’ he said			1
‘ i think we ’re in a very difficult situation , where the mortgage market is impaired , where very high deposits are being demanded of people , and families are being priced out of the housing market			2
that is neither economically right nor socially fair			0
’ quizzed by the @entity29 , the chancellor repeatedly refused to say whether he thinks house prices will rise			0
he told the @entity30 that it is not his ‘ intention ’ to help those purchasing a second home but again refused to rule out that possibility			0
example : the proposed scheme is split into two separate streams , the first ( above ) for buyers purchasing new build homes and the second ( below ) for everyone else but he added : ‘ the absolutely clear intention of the scheme is to help people buy their first home or move home as their family grows			1
’ he also used his appearance at the @entity30 to denounce his @entity84 critics who have demanded radical measures to slash tax or spending further			0
he told the @entity29 : ‘ you get the argument from some right - wing economists that what the economy needs is shock therapy			0
i would argue the @entity92 economy has had quite enough shock therapy in the last three or four years			0
’ example : the proposed scheme is split into two separate streams , the first ( above ) for buyers purchasing new build homes and the second for everyone else			2

@entity19 says chancellor **'s** *flagship* *budget* plan will do little to boost building but *flood* the market with buyers
@entity1 *insists* scheme will provide *incentive* to builders
@entity35 **'s** @entity34 accused warned move could price people out of market
