@entity0 has warned @entity1 that filling the number seven shirt at @entity3 will be ' a big responsibility ' but has backed him to rise to the challenge			1
@entity6 will be following in the footsteps of @entity0 in playing in that shirt after his £ 59.7million move from @entity10 , as well as other @entity3 greats including @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity0 , speaking at the @entity15 draw in @entity16 , added that he was relishing the prospect of facing @entity18 in @entity19 but that @entity10 were determined to hold on to their crown even without the likes of @entity6 , to whom he sent a message of support			1
' and i said to him ' number seven is a big responsibility ' but i think he will be able to take that shirt because he 's a fantastic player			1
@entity3 is one of the best clubs in the world , and it 's going to be good for him and i wish the best of luck to him			1
' personally , it 's a shame for me because i liked @entity6 , a very important player for us as was @entity40 ( who is understood to be on the verge of joining @entity43 )			1
they are situations that happen in football , players come and players go			0
pedigree : as well as @entity0 , @entity12 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity13 wore no 7 ' they are decisions of the club			2
we have bought very well with players like @entity56 [ @entity57 ] , [ @entity59 ] @entity58 and [ @entity61 ] @entity60 and for that reason we are in good condition with a great squad			0
' @entity0 admitted he was surprised at @entity3 's poor start to the season , saying : ' a little bit , yes			1
but it 's still early			0
' the 29 - year - old , named @entity71 's @entity19 player of the year for 2013/14 , believes that @entity10 can still target the treble even after the departures			1
he said : ' our target is to win it again - the @entity15 , the @entity77 - everything			0
' we 're going to try to do the same this season , win the @entity15			0
we know it 's a hard competition to win but we will try because @entity10 are always thinking big - huge			1
champion : the @entity82 winger won the @entity15 last season with @entity10 ' @entity18 are a fantastic team			2
they came very close last year to winning the @entity84			0
we know it 's going to be a very tough game at their home			0
so it 's going to be tough			0
' but in general the group is nice and it 's going to be good for @entity10			2
' @entity0 said he was still not at full fitness - a condition that affected him in the @entity94			2
' everyone knows i 'm not at 100 per cent but right now i will have time to prepare and recover so that when the tough games come @entity0 will be ready			2
' i still need a bit of time			0
i did n't have a pre-season like i 'd have wanted to have			0
but little by little i 'm gaining confidence and getting better physically and certainly in one or two weeks i will be in top shape			0
' pre-season : @entity0 admitted that he is not quite fit enough yet as he did not have a proper pre-season @entity106 keen on @entity10 record			1

@entity3 number seven shirt is ' big responsibility '
that was the warning @entity0 gave to @entity1
@entity116 's side paid £ *60million* for @entity6
@entity40 also looks likely to leave @entity10
