as many as 1,000 greyhounds a year are being exported from @entity1 to @entity2 and @entity3 where they are injected with arsenic , cocaine , @entity7 and methamphetamines to increase their aggression ahead of fight - to - the - death races			1
just weeks after the live - baiting scandal rocked the dog racing industry - when the use of live pigs , possums and rabbits to train greyhounds and boost their aggression was exposed - a horrific and often unsanctioned international trade can also be revealed by @entity21			1
the dogs , both young animals and those at the end of their racing lives , are shipped mostly to @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 where they are housed in appalling conditions			1
this one - time @entity1 competitor died immediately after a race bloodsport			1
the horrid outcome of a match race in @entity30 after two dogs pursue the lure to the end			1
animal rights groups in @entity3 say they often descend into a fight to the death the @entity50 in @entity28 where many @entity1 dogs compete			1
animals @entity1 says ' @entity28 offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and ... every dog imported to the country from @entity1 is dead within around three years ' although there are legal , strictly policed races , at the end of unofficial events the blood - thirsty animals often maul each other to death			1
if an animal finishes outside the top three in five consecutive races they are euthanised or dumped by the side of the road , where they starve to death			2
@entity30 - based animal rights group @entity69 says that @entity1 and @entity3 dogs are particularly sought after in @entity3 because of their superior pedigree			1
animal protection groups have called for immediate government intervention , fearing that the crackdown on local trainers after the live - baiting scandal was exposed will lead to an increase in the black market trade to these gambling - loving countries			1
@entity1 dogs , along with those from the @entity83 and @entity84 , are considered among the best in the world for both racing and breeding purposes , and are exported to countries which struggle to produce quality runners			1
in something akin to the barbaric scenes at cock - fighting rings or dog fights , activists say that at some tracks the greyhounds race in pairs down a straight , with frenzied punters packed either side , and the animals often maul each other at the end of a sprint			1
animal protection groups in @entity30 have joined the call for @entity1 's @entity107 to intervene , fearing that the crackdown on local trainers because of the live - baiting scandal , will lead to the ' black market ' trade of @entity1 greyhounds gathering even more pace killing fields			1
these stomach churning images are published by animal protection groups as proof of the horrific lack of control over the fate of greyhounds in @entity2 freedom of information documents obtained by @entity123 from the @entity124 and seen by @entity21 show only 20 dogs were officially registered as arriving from @entity1 in @entity30 in the past two years			1
it 's widely suspected that hundreds more have been exported through back channels			0
there is no information about the fates of these animals			0
' @entity132 here , including those from @entity1 , suffer a terrible fate , ' claims an activist from @entity137 , who gave her name only as @entity139			2
' here the situation is this ; they use the galgos ( greyhounds ) in an exhaustive way			0
in one day , they can race in many places sometimes ( and ) are drugged with arsenic , cocaine , @entity7 and methamphetamines			2
' sometimes they give them the drugs directly in their chest in the racing facilities			0
' many times they die in the racing facility			0
a racing galgo does n't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs			0
' some , she said , are saved for breeding but even then they are plied with reproductive drugs			0
' that is the best scenario , but if they are no good at running , they are discharged on roads or left to die of starvation and in some cases they are killed			0
' ' many times they die in the racing facility			0
a racing galgo does n't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs ' say animal rights groups in @entity30 , who provided this image to show the level of neglect for a one - time racing dog if they are no good at running , they are discharged on roads , or left to die of starvation , and in some cases they are killed ' according to @entity137 from @entity30 with punting , legal and otherwise , a major past - time in parts of @entity30 and @entity31 , exposing those who trade in the barbarism comes at a cost for groups like @entity137 , with members subjected to death threats on a regular basis			1
' here ( in @entity3 ) they are used as merchandise , they are objects and when they are n't useful anymore they get rid of them , ' @entity199 said			0
' sometimes they are sold and other times they change them for a chair or a television or anything			0
' races are prohibited in two @entity30 regions , including the capital @entity216 and in @entity217			2
@entity218 is debating whether to shut down the industry too			0
while it is clear that many have previously been sent using official channels , through the control of authorities via a ' greyhound passport ' , there has been a crackdown on that process by governing bodies like @entity230			1
the exports , however , continue unabated			0
lobbyists say just how so many end up in countries like @entity30 and @entity234 ( which is not on the official list ) remains a mystery			2
@entity132 @entity238 ceo @entity237 admitted that @entity239 has no control of the greyhound export industry			2
‘ we have absolutely no idea of what dogs had gone where in the past six months because we are totally out of the loop , ' he said			0
‘ it ’s because of the lack of regulations , something we have stressed to the ( agriculture ) minister and hoped we ’d get a meeting with him to discuss it but that has n't eventuated as yet but we are still trying			0
@entity132 data shows some of @entity1 's best known runners have been sent through the correct channels over the years to spend their time in the breeding kennels in places like @entity3			2
animal activists want tighter controls on exports by the @entity107 to ensure the future of all greyhounds lobbyists say not all dogs face the same fate , however , pointing to several examples over the years of top @entity1 greyhounds like this one being cared for in the correct manner by respected @entity30 studs ‘ the passport has no government regulatory standing but at least that enabled us to make sure they ( greyhound owners ) were doing the right thing			1
‘ exporting @entity1 greyhounds without a @entity239 issued passport is against the rules but some might take the risk knowing that government allows their export as long as the dogs are fit and well			1
‘ they enter into private arrangements and when someone says 100 have gone over in the past month , it ’s out of our hands – a member of the public with no connection to the governing body can send them to anywhere in the world , if they want			0
’ he 's also called on the @entity107 to put strong legislation behind ' the rules ' of greyhound exports			0
there are examples of successful transitions ; including star performers @entity308 and @entity310 , who had top careers on the track in @entity1 and went on to have rewarding stud lives and were treated humanely			0
they , however , are rare examples			0
up until now , authorities have been scrambling to keep on top of the shipping of @entity1 greyhounds to @entity2 , particularly @entity28 , for competition at the @entity320 , but now revelations they are appearing with greater frequency in @entity3 , has activists concerned			1
' i think what ’s clear is that the welfare of greyhounds is not a priority , these dogs come a distant second to profits on offer in this industry , ' @entity324 from @entity123 said			2
' in @entity1 , thousands of healthy dogs are killed simply because they do n’t run fast enough and hundreds are exported overseas each year to countries that have no laws to protect them from cruelty			1
' the country of greatest concern currently is @entity28 where dogs are raced at a facility called the @entity50			0
' they are kept in small cages when not racing and are killed if they fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races			0
' dogs sent to @entity28 from @entity1 are dead within three years			2
greyhound racing in @entity28 is built around the supply of dogs from @entity1 which makes the situation all the more outrageous			1
' advocates also warn that , many of the export countries ( in @entity2 ) , are known for their huge illegal trade in dog meat for human consumption			1
' @entity28 offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and the head of the @entity28 government ’s animal control department has stated that every dog imported to the country from @entity1 is dead within around three years , ' ms @entity324 added			2
' @entity230 has stopped issuing passports to allow greyhounds to be sent for racing but that has n't stopped the export			0
' it 's time for the @entity1 government to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether			2
' animal advocates have called on the @entity379 ' to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether ' to provide more protection for the animals			1
this is an example of a neglected pup in @entity30 the live - baiting scandal has led to more than 70 @entity1 trainers being implicated			1
five @entity389 greyhound trainers have already been banned for life @entity123 claim that ' greyhounds from @entity1 were killed at the @entity50 at a rate of more than one every day '			2
' nearly all of these dogs were healthy and not even five years old			0
all they had done wrong is fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races , ' ms @entity324 said			0
' with an ongoing supply of dogs from @entity1 , this unethical practice can continue , and is even threatening to expand			0
' @entity28 is the only place in @entity402 where greyhound racing is currently legal but that could soon be expanded			2
her @entity3 colleagues agree : ' the shortage of quality animals ( in @entity3 ) means the exporting to places such as @entity30 from @entity1 can be a profitable business			1
' @entity21 has contacted the @entity411 's office for comment			0
with punting , legal and otherwise , a major past - time in parts of @entity30 and @entity31 , exposing those who trade in the barbarism comes at a cost for groups like @entity137 , who are subjected to death threats on a regular basis			1

@entity1 greyhounds sent to the races in @entity3 are fed arsenic and @entity7 to ' run until they die '
unsanctioned races even see dogs race in pairs watched by punters lined against a fence often ending in greyhounds mauling each other
animal protection groups say the dogs are arriving in countries like @entity30 and @entity31 in increasing numbers
so - called ' greyhound passport ' process has been *suspended* but the export continues particularly to @entity2
@entity21 has seen @entity444 documents showing more than 20 countries receive greyhounds from @entity1 and their fate after that is *unknown*
