by @entity0 updated : 03:28 est , 23 january 2012 almost two and a half decades after entering the supercomputing race but losing ground thereafter , @entity2 is now rebooting with a vengeance			1
the government has discreetly embarked upon a billiondollar initiative to create next - generation supercomputers			1
but unlike the ` 1,750 ( $ 35 ) tablet pc , which is unfolding under the glare of high - voltage publicity , the supercomputing programme is shrouded in secrecy			1
so much so , the plan details have not yet been shared with scientists who have developed such mega machines in the past			1
the government has committed ` 5,000 crore ( nearly $ 1billion ) for the plan , making it the largest ever grant for a single research programme since @entity21			1
the money is likely to start flowing during the 12th five - year plan period			2
@entity24 : a series of supercomputers titled @entity27 was launched by the @entity28 , @entity29 the only jarring aspect of the project is that its reins are being handed over to the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , @entity34 , which has only been a user and not a designer or developer of supercomputers			2
@entity2 had begun its foray in supercomputing nearly 25 years ago after the @entity40 denied it a supercomputer meant for weather research			1
when the first @entity2 supercomputer , @entity27 , was launched in 1991 , @entity2 was only the third country in the world to possess supercomputing power after the @entity40 and @entity46			2
@entity47 joined the race 10 years later than @entity2 but surpassed it soon			1
the current initiative , conceived in the @entity50 and nurtured by the @entity51 , is a direct response to the @entity47 challenge			1
currently , @entity2 supercomputers are at a teraflop stage			2
this means they can perform several trillion floating point operations per second			2
@entity47 , @entity46 and the @entity40 have already achieved petaflop capability			1
such supercomputers are able to perform a thousand trillion floating point operations per second			2
committed : prime minister @entity62 is determined that @entity2 should catch up these countries have also begun work on the next level - exascale - to develop machines with the capacity of an exaflop or one million teraflops			2
in order to remain in the race , @entity2 would first need to develop a petaflop machine and then aim for exascale			2
when contacted , dr @entity72 , secretary , department of science and technology , confirmed the development , revealing that the programme had been conceived with a view ' to position @entity2 strongly in supercomputing ' and would be implemented in mission mode			2
a detailed project report was ready and loose ends , if any , would be tied up soon			0
earlier this month , prime minister @entity62 had announced at the @entity81 at @entity82 in @entity83 that the @entity33 would spearhead the project			0
' all knowledge institutions would be linked , but will be coordinated by the @entity33 , ' @entity72 elaborated			0
while the decision to rejoin the race could be a good strategic move , the choice of @entity33 as the leader of this ambitious programme has left experts baffled			0
the institute has never planned , designed and developed supercomputers in the past			0
in fact , its supercomputer centre is mostly focused on academic research and education			1
the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) - it has developed a series of supercomputers , including @entity27 , and already prepared a roadmap for a petaflop machine - would strangely have to play second fiddle to the @entity33			0
other scientific agencies such as those working in the fields of defence , atomic energy , space and aerospace labs , too , have proven expertise in supercomputer design and architecture			0
in the private sector , @entity116 - a supercomputer developed by @entity119 's @entity118 - became the world 's fourth most powerful system in 2007			1
first of the few : the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) @entity124 in @entity34 ' we lost ground to late entrants such as @entity47 only because of inadequate investment and a fragmented approach to supercomputing			1
and when the government is ready to invest , it has decided to make a non-player the captain of the game , ' a leading scientist , who has been involved in developing supercomputers , said			1
the government , he added , had overlooked indigenous design expertise developed over the past 25 years			1
supercomputer consists of thousands of integrated computersin a single room			0
they can solve complex problems in astrophysics , climate modeling , @entity143 power is measured by howmany floating point operations or ‘ flops ’ it can complete per @entity152 teraflop is one trillion floating point operations per second			0
this measure describes multiplicationsthat can be performed per @entity156 , built by @entity28 in 2002 , reached the peak of 1 teraflop performance			0
@entity116 , developed by the @entity118 , achieved 117.9 teraflop in @entity161 petaflop is the next level of computing , which indicates a processing speed of one thousandtrillion flop			0
@entity46 ’s k computer achieves 10 petaflopsthe current summit of supercomputing is achieving the exascale or capacity of an exaflop - one quintillion flops			0
the @entity40 , @entity46 and @entity47 are working onexascale machinesin 2007 , @entity2 & @entity47 had ninesupercomps in the @entity173 2011 , @entity2 had only two @entity174 ’s shot up to 74 in the list ' the @entity33 has its own strengths , but somehow it does n't spring to mind as the first choice for the nodal agency , ' @entity176 , formerly a scientist in the supercomputing team of the @entity178 ( @entity178 ) , felt			1
he is currently the editor of @entity183			0
the idea of bringing back @entity2 into the mainstream of high performance computing , he said , could be best implemented through a consortium of agencies such as @entity28 , @entity178 , @entity189 ( @entity189 ) and @entity119 's @entity118			1
all of them have proven expertise in designing and developing supercomputers			0
' they should come together in an " ego-less " public - private alliance to pool their strengths and deliver a truly @entity2 platform for exascale computing , ' @entity176 added			0
after @entity47 emerged a global leader in supercomputing in 2010 , sources said the pioneer of @entity28 supercomputers , dr @entity204 , had shared a blueprint on ' building @entity206 ' with government agencies			1
the plan had mentioned an investment of rs 500 crore to build a petascale facility in two years and rs 5000 crore for reaching the exascale capacity by 2020			0
@entity204 , however , did not comment on the latest development			0
' right now , we are in the dark about what the @entity216 's initiative is all about			1
no timelines , responsibilities and technological options have been revealed to anyone			0
such a large scientific programme should be carried out in an open , transparent manner and should be peer - reviewed , ' a @entity34 - based scientist said .			0
