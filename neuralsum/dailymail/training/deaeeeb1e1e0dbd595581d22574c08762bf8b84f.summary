celebrities including @entity1 have come out in support of a children 's charity facing a backlash over over a @entity7 video targeting an @entity8			1
invisible children posted a 30 minute documentary about the actions of brutal @entity13 warlord @entity12 , whose bloodthirsty @entity14 has terrorised parts of east and central @entity13 for 25 years , on the website			1
but as accusations emerge that the non-profit organisation spent the vast majority of its donations on film production , staff salaries and transport in producing the @entity7 viral , several celebrities have lent their name to the cause			1
@entity1 , pictured at this year 's @entity29 , has called @entity9 to discuss helping the charity while other celebs including rapper @entity32 , chat show queen @entity33 and @entity34 have also voiced interest in the campaign the aim of the campaign is to raise awareness of @entity12 , the leader of the @entity14 in @entity40 campaigners want to see an end to @entity12 's brutal rebellion in @entity40 in the @entity7 video ' @entity46 ' , producers beg for celebrity support to raise awareness and showed a picture of @entity1 , in an effort to get her involved			1
and the plea seems to have worked , with @entity1 contacting the charity this week expressing an interest in creating another video to keep the momentum against @entity12 going , according to @entity57 website @entity58			1
other celebrities including rapper @entity32 , chat show queen @entity33 and @entity34 have also voiced interest in the campaign			1
the @entity61 hashtags # stopkony and # kony2012 were yesterday trending worldwide as campaigners sought to increase international pressure for the killer to be caught with the viral video that has now been viewed 26million times			2
but some experts are still questioning @entity9 's motives and charitable record			1
@entity12 launched his guerilla army in 1987 but the group has no political aim			1
he claims to be fighting under @entity76 's orders to establish a society based on the @entity79 's @entity78			0
he has led a campaign of fear throughout northern @entity40 and neighbouring countries			0
the organisation is believed to have murdered tens of thousands of people , abducted at least 30,000 children to work as sex slaves or soldiers and forced more than 1.5million people to flee their homes			2
the brutal campaign has forced millions to live in fear and sees families in some areas abandoning their rural homes at night to sleep in makeshift refugee camps			0
kony and several of his leading lieutenants were indicted in 2005 by the @entity98 for crimes against humanity			0
the group 's founders , who support military action against @entity12 , have also been criticised for offering support to the armies of @entity106 and @entity40 despite claims both have been involved in rape and looting			2
despite the controversy , the @entity111 video was this week appearing to achieve the group 's stated aim of raising awareness about the warlord			1
the 50 - year - old @entity40 launched his guerilla army in 1987 and claims to be fighting under @entity76 's orders to establish a society based on the @entity79 's @entity78			0
his ruthless @entity14 , which has no political aim , has led a campaign of fear throughout northern @entity40 and neighbouring countries			2

@entity12 and his men are wanted for crimes against humanity after inflicting horrific injuries on @entity40 people about 100 @entity57 troops were sent to @entity40 to help in the pursuit of @entity12 and his followers this image from 2005 shows an @entity14 brigadier being stretchered away by @entity146 officers the group operated for more than a decade in northern @entity40 but left in 2008 and have since committed atrocities in @entity106 , @entity149 and the @entity150			1
@entity40 's army has theoretically hunted the organisation 's leaders but @entity12 has continually evaded capture - at times arrogantly even emerging from the jungle to give interviews to journalists before disappearing again			2
last october @entity57 president @entity158 announced he was sending troops to help the hunt for the @entity14			0
around 100 @entity57 soldiers have since been deployed in the region to help local officials trace the mass killer .			0

motives and charitable record of @entity168 called into question over cost of producing the @entity7 video on warlord @entity12
