astronomers have captured storms raging on the normally bland face of @entity3 - although the origin of the storms remains a mystery			1
the storms were first spotted back in august but more recent images have revealed they are still occurring			1
and the cloud activity is so bright that even amateur astronomers have seen signs of it in the blue - green atmosphere of the planet , which is 30 times further away from the @entity15 than the @entity16			1
these are infrared images of @entity3 obtained on 6 august 2014 with the @entity18 in @entity19			1
the white spot is an extremely large storm that was brighter than any feature ever recorded on the planet astronomers observing @entity3 with the @entity18 in @entity19 detected eight large storms in the planet 's northern hemisphere on august 5 and 6			1
one was the brightest ever measured on @entity3 , accounting for 30 per cent of all light reflected by the rest of the planet at a wavelength of 2.2 microns			1
this is the ' colour ' of light that senses clouds just below the tropopause , where the atmospheric pressure is half what it is at the @entity16 's surface			0
later observations by amateur astronomers revealed a bright spot , which scientists believe is evidence of storm activity much deeper in the atmosphere			1
@entity3 boasts a thick atmosphere with winds blowing at 560 mph ( 900 km / h )			1
it has massive storms that could engulf continents on @entity16 , and temperatures in the -220 ° @entity51 ) range			0
the planet 's strange tilt is the cause behind this bizarre weather system			0
the @entity16 has seasons because the axis tilts , and the hemisphere tilted towards the sun gets more light than that the region tilted away			0
but @entity3 has an axis that runs almost parallel to the plane			2
it also spins backwards , compared to the other planets , making its tilt 98 degrees			0
this causes 21 - year - long seasons and unusual cold weather			0
for nearly a quarter of the @entity3 year - equal to 84 @entity16 years - the sun shines directly over each pole			2
but interestingly , the extremely bright storm seen by @entity18 in the near infrared is not the one seen by the amateurs , which is much deeper in the atmosphere than the one that initially caused all the excitement			2
is is thought this feature is below the uppermost cloud layer of methane - ice in @entity3 's atmosphere			1
@entity87 amateur astronomer @entity86 processed the amateur images and confirmed the discovery of a bright spot on an image by @entity87 amateur @entity92 , then in others taken by fellow amateurs in september and october			1
he had his own chance on 3 and 4 october to photograph it with the @entity98 one - meter telescope , where on the second night , ' i caught the feature when it was transiting , and i thought , " yes , i got it ! " ' said @entity86			0
' i was thrilled to see such activity on @entity3			2
getting details on @entity103 , @entity104 or @entity105 is now routine , but seeing details on @entity3 and @entity107 are the new frontiers for us amateurs and i did not want to miss that			0
' i was so happy to confirm myself these first amateur images on this bright storm on @entity3 , feeling i was living a very special moment for planetary amateur astronomy			1
' these optical images of @entity3 were taken on 19 september and 2 october , showing the dramatic appearance of a bright storm on a planet that normally displays only a diffuse bright polar region a total solar eclipse hangs in the sky over the @entity18 on 11 july 1991 , and the @entity123 is seen in the background			1
the edge of the @entity127 's shadow can be seen near the horizon the findings were first presented at a meeting of the @entity132 's @entity131 in @entity133 , @entity134			0
co-investigator dr @entity135 , from the @entity137 @entity136 , who was part of the initial observation in august said : ' this type of activity would have been expected in 2007 , when @entity3 's once every 42 - year equinox occurred and the sun shined directly on the equator			2
' but we predicted that such activity would have died down by now			0
why we see these incredible storms now is beyond anybody 's guess			0
' @entity3 has a diameter four times that of @entity16 and is wrapped in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium , plus a dash of methane that gives it a blue tint			2
because it is so distant - 30 times farther from the sun than @entity16 - astronomers were able to see little detail on its surface until adaptive optics on the @entity18 telescopes revealed features much like those on @entity104			0
bright clouds are probably caused by gases such as methane rising in the atmosphere and condensing into highly reflective clouds of methane ice			1
because @entity3 has no internal source of heat , its atmospheric activity was thought to be driven solely by sunlight , which is now weak in the northern hemisphere			0
hence astronomers were surprised when these observations showed such intense activity .			0

astronomers have spotted storms raging on the planet @entity3
the storms were first spotted back in august from @entity19
but they were then studied again by amateur astronomers in october
images reveal bright clouds in the atmosphere of the planet
the cause of the huge storms is unknown
