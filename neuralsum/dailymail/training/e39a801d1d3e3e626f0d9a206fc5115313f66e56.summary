by @entity1 reporter published : 17:46 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 : 04:20 est , 28 february 2014 as two of @entity7 's most powerful women , they must have a few things in common			0
yet when the @entity10 met @entity12 leader @entity11 yesterday they seemed keen not to get too close standing well outside of the monarch 's personal space , mrs @entity11 reached gingerly over to shake the her hand as she went for tea at @entity17			1
and @entity10 and mrs @entity11 subsequently remained at a safe distance as they posed , smiling warmly , for the cameras			2
after the prime minister and the @entity12 chancellor – the most powerful leader in @entity7 – posed grinning for the cameras outside the front door of @entity47 , @entity36 planted a firm kiss on @entity11 ’s cheek			2
it was the beginning of a series of awkward poses , with mr @entity36 ’s attempt at a handshake to seal the bond of friendship seeming not to go down too well			0
cheese : the two leaders smile awkwardly outside 10 @entity39 before mr @entity36 swoops in , right a grimace from the chancellor : not quite the reaction mr @entity36 might have hoped for as the prime minister placed one hand in hers and the other firmly on her arm , mrs @entity11 ’s reaction was to pull a face , mouth turned down – possibly feeling that mr @entity36 was getting a bit too close , although it may have been a @entity12 attempt at a smile in response to a @entity37 attempt at humour			1
perhaps in a nod to her @entity77 host , mrs @entity11 had opted for a bright blue jacket , which she wore with smart black trousers and flat shoes .			0

mrs @entity11 had been on a one - day visit to @entity83
there was further awkwardness when she met @entity36 at @entity47
