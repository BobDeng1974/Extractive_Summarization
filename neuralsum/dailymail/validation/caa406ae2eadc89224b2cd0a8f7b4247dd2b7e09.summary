@entity1 verdict in one sense disappointment because that was the fourth straight year @entity1 have finished runners - up			1
professional sport is about winning ; sport ’s oldest adage is ‘ nobody remembers who came second ’			0
on the other hand , @entity1 are growing and improving and i am very positive and excited about this team			1
they have discovered a creative , attacking game that can put any team in the world under pressure if they have the courage to use it			0
if they work massively on their defence , ensure the full might and power of @entity1 ’s front five can be brought into every game and become far more clinical in their decision - making at key moments they can achieve great things			1
and @entity27 was rocking again on saturday , the first time in ages we really did have 80,000 people on their feet screaming			0
@entity1 are going to be incredibly tough to beat at @entity27 this autumn and that ’s a good place to be in a @entity33			1
@entity1 's players form a huddle after narrowly missing out on the @entity37 title to @entity38 on saturday head coach @entity39 walks down the tunnel after watching his country 's 55 - 35 victory against @entity43 @entity44 get right and wrong ? 15			1
@entity59 bench : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 right : he has nailed down the first - choice half - back combination — @entity50 and @entity51 — and that is huge			1
@entity73 has been impressive from the start and @entity51 has finished the tournament like a train			1
the coach has also given @entity47 his head at 13 and @entity1 have a real cutting edge at outside centre , supported by two fast - developing wings			1
@entity49 has impressed in all sorts of ways and @entity46 has pace and class , although he needs to find ways of getting more involved			0
the first - choice @entity1 backs , with the exception of 12 , pick themselves now and have a tournament together under their belt			1
@entity58 is now an 80 - minute player — he did n’t miss a minute of the five games			2
that ’s a big step forward and down to hard work and dedication			0
@entity50 ( pictured ) , alongside @entity51 , have formed a first - choice half - back combination wrong : @entity39 missed a golden opportunity to check on @entity97 ’s form by starting him against @entity98 , when i would also have tried @entity48 at 12			1
@entity50 could get injured , so @entity97 needs to be fully integrated and @entity48 could be the answer in a problem position			2
@entity1 have also missed out by not getting @entity102 involved because there are occasions when the back row has looked unbalanced and one - paced			1
it is too late now and that idea , alas , has to be binned totally			0
i am still puzzled by some of the substitutions			0
no @entity97 against @entity38 , then he was brought on at full back on saturday when it cried out for him to play at inside centre			1
also , why bring on @entity115 , who is just not an impact player , for @entity51 with 10 minutes left against @entity43 ? @entity51 was enjoying the game of his life and when the adrenaline is pumping you can achieve remarkable things			1
it was his day and he was n’t finished			0
@entity39 missed an opportunity to start @entity97 ( centre ) against @entity98 during the @entity37 how can @entity1 improve their defence ? @entity1 conceded 11 tries in the tournament and though i would discount the @entity43 game as an extraordinary one - off , they still coughed up sloppy scores in other games			1
at this level it is about two things on top of great technique			0
firstly , you have to throw a mental switch from attacking to defending			0
you must instantly go into a different mindset			0
that defensive mindset was just not there on saturday and cost @entity1 the championship			2
secondly , you need to communicate all the time from 1 - 15 — keep talking , pointing and tackling			2
if @entity27 is going to become a fortress again it starts and finishes with defence — 11 tries is six too many for a team which has the firepower to trouble any side			0
@entity51 goes over the line to give @entity1 an early lead in their must - win @entity37 clash against @entity43 @entity158 star @entity51 jumps for joy after scoring the first try of the match on saturday evening player of the tournament my @entity1 player of the tournament is @entity50 , who has quickly proved himself a real gem			1
he is the man who has started bringing out the full potential of a talented and dangerous @entity1 back division			1
my player of the tournament , though , is @entity38 flanker @entity171 , who is a force of nature when fully fit			1
he set the tone for @entity38 in their important win over @entity1 and his display against the @entity177 on saturday was the most impactful individual performance of the tournament			1
@entity73 ( centre ) is my @entity1 player of the tournament - he has proved himself as a real talent are @entity184 worthy champions ? yes , totally			1
they have the best coach in @entity187 and the outstanding captain and leader in @entity190			0
@entity38 have seamlessly brought in young players , notably @entity192 and @entity193 , who have replaced @entity194 and @entity195			2
@entity187 varies his game plans and selections cleverly and rarely misses a trick			0
they outplayed and out - thought @entity1 in @entity200 and their more expansive — but ruthless — game plan at @entity202 was delivered perfectly			1
@entity38 are rock solid , they are only going to get better and will not fall off the cliff like they did in the 2007 @entity33 in @entity43			2
the @entity184 will be a big factor at @entity206			0
@entity38 have the best coach in @entity187 and @entity208 ( right ) is an outstanding captain and leader @entity211 they look very dangerous and threatening and are building their year nicely			2
@entity213 is another excellent coach — for some reason he never gets the full credit he is due — and he will have @entity216 perfectly fine - tuned by september			2
their incredible defence against @entity38 impressed me most of all and they have dangerous backs all over the park			2
my one concern would be their front row , with injuries and the retirement of @entity227			0
even in that huge win in @entity230 , @entity228 pushed them about a bit at scrum - time			2
they ca n’t afford that to happen at the @entity33 but @entity213 has been there and has the t - shirt , and @entity216 really need to get behind him now			0
@entity213 never gets the full credit he deserves and he will have @entity216 fine - tuned by september @entity237 in fact it was a eureka moment ! it was when @entity50 took that quick line - out throw on @entity1 ’s own line in the first half on saturday and started a brilliant counter-attack that ended with @entity51 going in under the posts			1
that was this @entity1 team at their best and most dangerous and they need to be fearless and reproduce that in the very biggest games			2
will they do it in the first minute against a world - class team in the @entity33 ? that ’s still the big question			0
@entity50 slides in to score @entity1 's fourth try of the afternoon and first of the second half against @entity43 and finally the french ! i do n’t buy for one minute this idea that the @entity258 is diluting their talent			1
they still have an incredible pool of players and any top coach would love the prospect of having the @entity266 national team			0
they just need to stop looking for excuses and start to leverage their amazing talent			0
yes , they have been a bit of a shambles at times in this tournament but , incredibly for a team who shipped 55 points , there were one or two hints at a brighter future on saturday			2
and i would say this : @entity43 turn up at @entity283			0
they have reached three finals and there will always be an anxiety about playing them in the knockout stages			0
@entity43 still have an incredible pool and players and they need to stop looking for excuses			0

@entity1 are growing and improving - the future is certainly exciting
@entity39 has done well to nail down a half - back combination
@entity50 and @entity51 have been very impressive for @entity1
@entity38 flanker @entity171 is my player of the @entity37 tournament
