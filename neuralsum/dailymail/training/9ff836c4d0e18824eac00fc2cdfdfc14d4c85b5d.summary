@entity6 is a ' catch - all ' diagnosis for lower leg pain triggered by sporting activities such as running , dancing and football			1
but it actually covers 31 different conditions which means many sufferers are failing to get targeted help that would put them back on their feet , it is claimed			1
wrong call : @entity6 is a ' catch - all ' diagnosis for lower leg pain triggered by sporting activities such as running , dancing and football new research from @entity22 shows that one in six people think they have shin splints - sometimes based on the opinion of coaches - but have n't sought a formal diagnosis			1
the survey of 2,000 people found one in three people have lower leg pain occasionally and one in ten say they often suffer with it			1
but exercise induced leg pain can be caused by a range of factors , including a growing trend for running , overuse injuries and training errors			1
other causes include inadequate footwear , poor muscle strength , poor core stability and balance , says the @entity22 , which represents health professionals diagnosing and treating disorders of the feet			0
experts at the @entity50 at @entity51 say using the term shin splints is resulting in half of such cases being misdiagnosed			0
as a result many sufferers are unable to exercise , remain in pain and even immobile in some cases			2
dr @entity59 , a @entity60 and @entity61 who is a @entity62 and @entity63 at the @entity64 said : ' i would like the term shin splints to be banned - there should be a law against it			0
' it 's a meaningless non-specific broad term used by clinicians , athletes and coaches to describe pain in the lower leg and it may prevent patients getting a correct diagnosis and could lead to long - term damage as a result , ' he said			1
dr @entity59 , who works at the @entity50 said : ' if you experience ongoing leg pain in the tibia - the sihn bone - and you have been told you have shin splints , it is vital to seek expert advice from a qualified health professional			1
' this can be a consultant podiatrist , lower limb orthopaedic specialist and some specialist physiotherapists			0
' some conditions mean athletes ca n't run for more than ten minutes without pain , or even walk , while others can lead to a stress fracture			2
' ' these conditions may not be life - threatening , but it 's as serious to an athlete who can not exercise and they should make sure they seek proper help early on , ' he added			2
he said there is good evidence that cases of exercise induced leg pain are increasing			2
the highest rate is among people doing cross country and long distance running - almost one in two regular runners will be affected at some point - followed by dancers			0
preventive measures are possible , he added			0
' when taking part in exercise and sport , make sure you prepare well and take into consideration all aspects of that sport or exercise , including appropriate footwear that is specific to that sport			0
