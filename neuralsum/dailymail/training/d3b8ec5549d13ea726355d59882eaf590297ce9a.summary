private eye editor @entity0 said the victims of the @entity4 shooting had ' paid a very high price for exercising their comic liberty '			1
the satirical magazine targeted by three masked gunmen is widely seen as @entity10 's answer to @entity11 and prides itself on a mixture of tongue - in - cheek reporting and investigative journalism			1
at least 12 people died in the attack , believed to include editorial staff members @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in @entity10 – men who had regularly satirised @entity34 and the @entity35 – including the newspaper 's editor - in - chief , @entity36			1

the former news journalist said : ' we are a little bit shocked			0
i think me and the writers think it is beyond belief really			0
' you think if it is possible that these sorts of extremists would turn their guns on writers and satirists			0
it seems such an extreme possibility that when it happens it shocks you to the core			0
' the massacre this morning was @entity10 's deadliest terror attack in at least two decades			1
witnesses said the suspect @entity97 killers were heard to shout ' the @entity35 has been avenged ' and ' allahu akbar ! ' as they stalked the building			0
horrific footage also emerged showing an injured police officer slumped on the pavement outside the office as two of the gunmen approach			2
@entity4 's editor - in - chief , @entity106 , who was in @entity107 at the time of the attack , said : ' i do n't understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons			1
a newspaper is not a weapon of war			0
' @entity71 users have begun using the # @entity119 hashtag in a show of solidarity with the publication			2
magazine @entity4 has taken several highly provocative swipes at @entity34			1
the magazine once named @entity35 as its guest editor , published cartoons of the holy figure in the nude , and once renamed itself @entity129 with the cover slogan ' 100 lashes if you do n't die of laughter '			2
the controversy began in 2006 when the publication reprinted now - infamous cartoons of @entity35 by @entity138 artist @entity137			2

@entity174 sources expect police , security services and senior politicians including the home secretary @entity178 to hold talks to discuss @entity56 's response to the attack			1
@entity56 's terror threat level is currently set at ' severe ' but the question of increasing to ' critical ' , the highest state of alert , is likely to be discussed			1

' there is a high threat from terrorism			0
due to ongoing threats to @entity10 by @entity205 groups , and recent @entity70 military intervention against @entity207 , the @entity70 government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its own domestic and overseas security measures			2
' previous incidents attributed to @entity205 extremists have included the shooting of 3 soldiers and 4 civilians in @entity215 , and a knife attack on a soldier near @entity154			2
' the @entity4 offices were burned to the ground in 2011 when attackers used @entity222 cocktails to start a blaze early in the morning of november 2			1
there was nobody in the building at the time , and the target was instead thought to be the magazine 's computer system , which was completely destroyed			2
riot police were forced to stand guard outside the building for days following the attack , as the editors took a defiant stance , choosing to reprint the cartoon images multiple times			2
in 2012 they again printed cartoons of the @entity35 as a deliberately provocative gesture while violent protests were taking place across the @entity142			0
the following year the magazine 's office again had to be surrounded by riot officers after they published a cartoon booklet depicting the @entity246 naked as a baby and being pushed in a wheelchair			2

@entity4 's current office building has no notices on the door to prevent a repeat of the attacks that have occurred in the past			1
in an interview with @entity267 in january 2013 , mr @entity19 revealed he had been placed under constant police protection for four months after one of the cartoon issues was published			0
he shrugged off criticism that he was only publishing the images to gain notoriety for @entity4 , and insisted that he was instead defending the right to free speech			1
mr @entity19 pointed out that the magazine had poked fun at feminism , nuclear energy and homeland security , but the @entity34 issues always attracted the most publicity			1
