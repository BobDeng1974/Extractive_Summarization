by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 05:31 est , 8 november 2013 @entity1 74 , was in intensive care after crashing his car when pc @entity4 visited him at @entity6 in june last year a 74 - year - old man who lay dying in intensive care after a car accident was threatened with prosecution by a policeman , an inquest was told			1
@entity5 @entity4 was criticised by a coroner for carrying out an ' inappropriate interview ' with the pensioner who was wearing an oxygen mask			1
@entity17 from @entity18 , @entity6 , died two days after the interview took place			2
according to the deceased 's family , the police officer was overheard going through a formal caution procedure before telling mr @entity17 he could face prosecution for dangerous driving			1
mr @entity17 was being treated for injuries from a car crash in which his twin sister , @entity28 , was also involved			1
the former police mechanic was allegedly left in tears after his conversation with @entity32 , family spokesman , @entity33 , told the inquest			0
a patient in the bed next to the 74 - year - old claimed she heard the police officer telling mr @entity17 that his sister 's life was hanging in the balance as she was being treated at a different hospital			1
mr @entity33 said sent a letter of complaint to @entity46 's chief constable to alert him to the way in which mr @entity17 had allegedly been treated			2
the complaint was referred to the @entity49 but was then handed back to be investigated by the force ’s own internal disciplinary department			0
it is understood the officer was ‘ given advice ’ but there was no further action			0
in evidence , @entity32 claimed the reason for the bedside interview was his concern the pensioner would be discharged and be allowed to drive again			2
he said the conversation was carried out ' under caution ' in order for a proper record to be kept of what was said			0
coroner @entity67 however asked : ' you had concerns that he might shortly be released and drive again ? but what is the reality of a man with serious injuries including a broken arm and with a car which is written off driving again ? ' ' according to the protocol at @entity6 did you get permission from senior medical staff to interview him ? ' @entity28 , 74 , was not well enough to attend the inquest in @entity79			1
the siblings lived in a house their father built for over 50 years before mr @entity17 's death the policeman said he had received permission from a nurse ( who had asked a doctor ) to conduct the interview , but could not remember either person 's name and had no record of the conversation			1
the officer denied that he threatened mr @entity17 with prosecution for dangerous driving but admitted that he told the pensioner his sister was ‘ very poorly ’ in @entity98			1
when mr @entity67 probed : ' did you tell mr @entity17 that it was all his fault , as was said by the woman in the next bed ? ' the officer said he had n't			2
the family 's representative , mr @entity33 added : ' did it not occur to you that mr @entity17 was not in a fit state to be interviewed - he was wearing an oxygen mask and his arm was in traction ' to which pc @entity4 responded by saying he had interviewed ' numerous ' people in oxygen masks before			1
a post mortem concluded that mr @entity17 died as the result of a heart attack combined with his multiple injuries			1
it was revealed the 74 - year - old suffered a heart disease which had caused him to collapse in the months before the accident			0
cardiology consultant professor @entity122 told the inquest that the bedside interview conducted by @entity32 on june 21 last year could have contributed to his cardiac arrest			2
' @entity127 stress can be linked to an increased risk of a heart attack and as mr @entity17 was already in a precarious medical state the interview could be sufficient to be associated with his heart attack , ' said the professor			1
' but i must stress that this can not be separated from his pre-existing poor medical condition and other factors and , in my view , it is more likely that he would have died in hospital anyway			0
' mr @entity17 suffered internal injuries , broken ribs and a fractured arm in the accident which is thought to have happened after he ' blacked out ' and veered off the road			1
miss @entity28 was left with wrist and rib fractures , and has undergone six operations since the crash			0
mr @entity67 concluded proceedings by saying : ' i do n’t think conducting an interview under caution was appropriate and there is no record of permission being sought for the interview			0
' ' nevertheless the stress of the interview is the same as the other contributing factors in this case , such as mr @entity17 ’ injuries and his serious heart condition , and can not be blamed for his death			1
' the appropriate conclusion therefore is that mr @entity17 died from natural causes			2
' a spokesman for @entity46 said after the hearing : ' first and foremost our thoughts are with the family of mr @entity17 for their loss			2
' following a complaint , an internal investigation was carried out by our @entity175			0
it resulted in words of advice to @entity32 around the issue of note taking and the case was closed with no further action			0
' when investigating road traffic collisions in which people are killed or seriously injured , it is essential officers are able to quickly establish the factors involved to allow them to preserve or gather evidence and assess if there is any criminal responsibility			0
' this is a key aspect of protecting the public and often means speaking to people who are being treated in hospital			0
we understand this can cause distress and our officers make every effort be sensitive to the circumstances			0
' in this case the interview was authorised by @entity32 's supervisor , agreed by a nurse and was very brief			0

@entity17 was in intensive care after crashing his car into a tree
the former mechanic suffered internal injuries and broken ribs
@entity5 @entity4 accused of threatening prosecution for dangerous driving
stress of the meeting could have contributed to mr @entity17 's death
a coroner *ruled* the bedside interview ' was not appropriate '
an inquest heard how the man died of natural causes
