but she refused to give up and @entity11 was eventually released into her care			1
weeks went by and one day , miraculously , @entity11 spoke			2
' i 'm trying , ' he told her			0
@entity8 would soon come to the painful conclusion that @entity11 had no idea she was his wife			1
@entity11 tells @entity27 that he also had no clue his father was dead or that he 'd been married to begin with			1

hopeless : @entity11 's motorcycle was split in two and doctors initially urged his wife to take him off life support @entity8 refused to give up on @entity11 and took him into her full time care as he was still bedridden and hooked to a feeding tube miracle : eventually , @entity11 started to improve and miraculously spoke the words ' i 'm trying ' one day weeks after @entity8 took him home with dismal prospects now , he and @entity8 work on his rehabilitation daily and use yoga to help him sharpen his mind and regain control of his body			1
while @entity8 is thrilled that @entity11 has improved to the point he no longer requires medications , she says on a @entity65 page started for the cause that the couple is too strapped to pay for all the rehabilitative care @entity11 still requires			1
and insurance will no longer cover it			0
' people with @entity73 need a lot of rehab , people continue to make improvements even 10 years after their injury , ' she writes			0
' insurance does n't pay for the amount of therapy they need so often times that person does n't reach their full potential			0
' thankfully , after just one month , the fundraiser has received some $ 11,000 in donations			0
as @entity11 continues to make great strides , most recently with his commitment to learning to walk the way he once did , he wants others to know how good they 've got it			1
' people do n't realize how much they can actually do with their bodies , ' he said			0
' they take it for granted			0
' improvements : now @entity8 says @entity11 is improving all the time and has gone from requiring 20 medications per day to requiring none			1
