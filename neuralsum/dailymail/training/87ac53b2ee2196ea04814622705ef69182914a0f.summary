warm - blooded animals tend to be coloured darker the closer they live to the equator			0
now that same rule has been found to exist in flowers as climate change warms up the planet , changing the pigmentation of plants around the world			2
@entity11 scientists made the discovery after looking to see how flowers appear from a bee 's perspective in the ultraviolet range			2
it may look similar to the naked eye but flower bloom ( left ) shows a larger area of dark pigmentation under uv light ( right )			1
the flowers come from the extreme north ( top ) and south ( bottom ) of @entity28 bees see things very differently to humans			2
for instance , what appears bright yellow to a person can appear dark or patterned to a bee			0
professor @entity37 at the @entity39 researchers studied the flowers of @entity41			1
the plant , which belongs to the rose family , was examined across four lines of latitude - three in the @entity46 and one in the @entity48			2
using ultraviolet imaging , professor @entity37 and his colleague , dr @entity52 , looked at the ' bull 's - eye ' centres of the flowers , which look dark to pollinators			1
researchers predict that as @entity58 receives more uv light at northern and southern climes due to depletion of the ozone layer from fossil fuels , flowers farther from the equator are likely to begin to evolve traits			1
they discovered that they were larger the nearer to the equator the flowers grew			1
larger ' bull 's - eyes , ' professor @entity37 explains , are associated with higher levels of ultraviolet light , which is more intense near the equator			1
the team believe larger bull 's - eyes absorb more ultraviolet light , acting as a protective trait because high ultraviolet light levels are known to damage @entity78			0
a species of butterfly named the quino checkerspot has defied expectations of extinction by moving to cooler climes and changing its diet as the planet warms , animals and plants are learning to adapt to their new environment by either migrating or evolving , new research has revealed			0
many scientists believe the rate of climate change is too rapid for various species to keep up			0
but two studies released last year have offered some hope that experts may have underestimated their abilities			0
the first study reveals how a species of butterfly named the quino checkerspot has defied expectations of extinction by moving to cooler climes and changing its diet			0
separate research led by @entity106 scientist @entity105 found how some corals can quickly switch on or off certain genes in order to survive in warmer - than - average tidal waters			0
the research team discovered corals can adjust their internal functions to tolerate hot water 50 times faster than they would adapt through evolutionary change alone			0
in their study , they confirmed that extreme ultraviolet light reduces the viability of pollen in @entity41			1
they predict that as @entity58 receives more ultraviolet light at extreme northern and southern climes due to depletion of the ozone layer , flowers farther from the equator are likely to begin to evolve traits			1
however , this may come at a cost as bigger bull 's - eyes obscure the ' sweet centre ' of the flower where pollen and nectar rewards are found , making poorer targets for bees			1
' @entity139 is coming earlier , and plants and pollinators are no longer in sync , ' dr @entity52 said			0
' increased ultraviolet radiation is causing the same sort of disruption			0
' the plant , which is in the rose family , was studied across four lines of latitude - three in the @entity46 and one in the @entity48			2
in their study , the researchers confirmed that extreme ultraviolet light reduces the viability of pollen in @entity41 ( pictured )			1

scientists studied the @entity41 across four lines of latitude
they focused on the centres of the flowers , which look dark to bees .
study found dark centre was larger the nearer to equator flowers grew
they predict that as @entity58 receives more uv light due to global warming , flowers farther from the equator will also evolve these traits
