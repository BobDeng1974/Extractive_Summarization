a @entity1 tourist who planned to spend a few days exploring an island in his canoe was left trapped and desperate on a hill for two weeks after being stalked by a monster crocodile			1
the unfortunate traveller had set up camp on remote governor @entity8 , off the coast of @entity11 , intending to paddle his canoe around the island but the arrival of the 20ft - long crocodile changed all that			1
instead , he remained terrified at his campsite , which he had hurriedly set up on a hill on the 250 - acre island in the hope that he was too far inland for the crocodile to reach him			2
terrifying a tourist : a @entity1 traveller was trapped on remote governor @entity8 off the @entity11 coast for two weeks after he was stalked by a 20ft - long crocodile ( file photo ) and it was only by chance that rescue came , when a light he flashed to attract attention resulted in him getting a lift in a boat to safety			1
the tourist , known only as @entity38 , owes his survival to local man @entity40 , who decided to check out the light and found the distraught man ' relieved and shocked			1
' mr @entity40 said today that ' every time he got in his little kayak , which was only about 2.5m ( 8ft ) long , this crocodile , which has lived there for many years , chased him			1
' he was desperate for water when i trotted up			0
' chance rescue : local man @entity40 saw the tourist 's light flashing from the island and rescued him by boat from the giant reptile ( file photo ) mr @entity40 said the crocodile was ' easily 20ft long ' , a measurement he said was accurate because that is the length of his boat and he has sailed past the reptile from time to time			1
a yachtsman had dropped @entity38 off at the island , off the north - west coast near @entity62 , which lies between @entity63 and @entity64 , and it was there that the tourist had decided to use his canoe to explore the inlets			2
after setting up a tent he realised he did not have enough supplies and decided to paddle the three miles back to the mainland			0
but as he launched his small canoe he saw the crocodile watching him - and made good his escape back to his camp site , which he then moved to higher ground			2
according to mr @entity40 , each time the @entity78 tourist tried to leave the island the crocodile ' made its presence felt , and so the fellow was left stranded there for an entire fortnight			2
' it was only when mr @entity40 spotted a light on the island and decided to check it out , that he courageously set foot there			0
' i 'd seen a light flashing in the scrub as i came through @entity94 , opposite governor @entity8 , and decided to have a look what it was			1
' when i arrived @entity38 came out of the bush looking distraught			0
he had no hat on and no shirt on			0
' he was relieved and shocked and thankful someone had come along because he was running out of options pretty quickly			0
' he is a very , very lucky man			0
' @entity38 was given a bed at a church mission on the mainland but his whereabouts today were unknown			0
