always fancied building a boat , but do n’t have the carpentry skills ? now you can print one			2
that ’s exactly what @entity5 engineers did in an effort to highlight the potential applications of what they claim to be the world ’s biggest 3d printer			1
the fully - functioning vessel can seat two adults and was created by @entity15 in @entity16 in @entity5 's @entity17			1
the fully - functioning vessel can seat two adults and was created by @entity15 in @entity16 in @entity5 's @entity17 they have created a huge 3d printer that has the ability to print in multiple materials and in full colour , according to project leader @entity22			1
the printer weighs 30,000lbs ( 15 tons ) and can create objects up to 13.2ft ( 4 metres ) in length with a height and breadth of around 6.6ft ( 2 metres )			1
it can print around 4.7 inches ( 12 cm ) in height per hour for hollow objects with a diameter of a little less than a metre			1
the printer weighs 30,000lbs ( 15 tons ) and can create objects up to four metres in length with a height and breadth of around two metres the plastic 3d boat shown in action is one of the first objects to be turned out by the huge @entity18 in @entity5 in april , @entity5 engineers were able to build 10 detached houses within 24 hours , using the modern technology			1
the compact houses were constructed using waste material which was pumped out into layers			0
and the properties were said to have been created for less than $ 5,000 ( £ 2,974 ) each			2
four huge printers measuring 105ft ( 32 metres ) long , 33ft ( 10 metres ) wide and 22ft ( 6.6 metres ) tall were used to make the bungalows			1
the new construction technique means affordable housing could be created faster than ever before			0
there are even hopes skyscrapers could be erected using the same technology			0
@entity5 has announced the first 3d printed house project will be located in @entity55 , a major city in @entity56			1
the plastic 3d boat is one of the first objects to be turned out by the 3d printer			1
the group has not revealed how much it cost to make			0
it measures 6.6ft ( two metres ) in length , is 2.7ft ( 0.8 metres wide ) , and weighs approximately 77lb ( 35kg )			1
3d printing involves by building up a 3d object from a computer file using layers of material			0
like a traditional inkjet printer , material , usually plastic , is laid down on a base			0
further layers are simply printed on top , gradually revealing a 3d object			0
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
shoes , jewellery and even dresses have been created , with designs often sold online			0
many believe it could even lead to ' mini factories ' for living rooms allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a replacement part for a broken household appliance			0
