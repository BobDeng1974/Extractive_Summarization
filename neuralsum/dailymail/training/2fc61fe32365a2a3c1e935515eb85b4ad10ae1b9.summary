the prime minister faced fresh embarrassment last night after it was revealed that his new party treasurer funded his son ’s membership of the notorious @entity5 , which mr @entity6 belonged to when he was a student at @entity7			1
@entity8 – a @entity9 financier who has donated more than £ 2.6million to the @entity10 – helped son @entity11 meet the high cost of joining the invitation - only , 200 - year - old male dining club , whose members are renowned for their excessive privilege and wild antics			1
during @entity21 ’s time in the @entity5 , its members were accused of going on the rampage at a smart hotel			1
revelations : prime minister @entity6 , left , faced fresh embarrassment last night after it was revealed that his new party treasurer , @entity8 , funded his son ’s membership of the notorious @entity5 mr @entity8 also bailed out @entity7 ’s @entity27 when a racism row led to it being kicked out of the university			1
his son was a senior official at the time			2
there is no suggestion @entity21 , now a 22 - year - old investment banker with @entity33 , was involved in the hotel incident or the race row			1
the disclosures come as mr @entity6 faces increasing criticism that he leads a ‘ government of chums ’ out of touch with the struggles of ordinary families			2
mr @entity8 became mr @entity6 ’s co-treasurer just two weeks ago , after fellow tycoon @entity44 was forced to resign over the so - called ‘ donorgate ’ scandal			1
mr @entity44 was secretly recorded offering access to @entity48 dinners with the prime minister in return for a £ 250,000 donation to conservative coffers			0
mr @entity6 had hoped the swift appointment of mr @entity8 would put an end to the controversy			1
instead , it has merely provided more ammunition for those who claim his inner circle is drawn from a rich and privileged elite			0
the @entity5 uniform alone costs more than £ 3,500 and club dinners cost hundreds of pounds , effectively restricting membership to the wealthiest students at @entity7			1
privileged : @entity21 ( second from left ) - son of @entity66 treasurer @entity8 - who is a former president of the @entity5			1
this photo was taken at @entity69 event at @entity70 since becoming @entity66 leader , mr @entity6 has tried hard to shrug off his @entity5 past			1
however , as a new mail on sunday poll shows today , far right , he has failed to do so			0
shown two photographs , one of mr @entity6 in his @entity5 sky - blue bow tie and tails , and a recent one of mr @entity6 as he would prefer to be seen , dressed in jeans drinking a pint of beer in a pub , most people chose the former as the ‘ real @entity6 ’			1
mr @entity8 , dubbed ‘ mr copper ’ after making £ 100 million from metals trading , was appointed just three months after enjoying a ‘ kitchen supper ’ with the prime minister at @entity90			1
mr @entity8 ’s son @entity11 became active in @entity7 ’s political scene shortly after going up to @entity93 to read theology in 2008			1
@entity11 , who attended the elite fee - paying @entity95 for boys in @entity97 – chancellor @entity99 ’s old school – was social secretary of the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) in his first year			1
in the summer of 2009 , the association was embroiled in a bitter public scandal after candidates for election to its governing committee were asked at a ‘ hustings ’ to tell the most racist joke they knew and name their ‘ least favourite minority ’			0
in response , one of the candidates told a joke about a black person hanging in a tree			0
another said : ‘ what do you say when you see a television moving around in the dark ? put it down you * * * * * * or i ’ll shoot you			0
’ unpaid : @entity11 , back row , far left , behind former defence secretary dr @entity123 at the controversial @entity69 dinner at @entity97 's @entity125 the incident led to the association being banned from using the university ’s name for a year			1
@entity11 , who was not present at the hustings when the comments were made , won election as treasurer , taking up his post at the start of the association ’s year in the wilderness in october 2009			1
the scandal had left the group struggling to raise funds , so @entity11 turned to his father			2
minutes from an association meeting , held that october , quote @entity11 as saying that he had ‘ talked to an anonymous @entity66 donor who will			2
be sending us money ’			0
according to one student present at the meeting , it was made clear that the donor in question was @entity8			2
the student told @entity152 : ‘ the rules say a treasurer needs to hand over £ 200 as a condition of taking his post			0
a few weeks later , @entity11 handed over a cheque which was at least ten times that amount			2
‘ it was made clear where the money had came from			0
we managed to survive on that for the rest of the year			0
we all said , “ thank @entity166 for @entity11 ’s father			2
” ’ the racism row was not the only scandal to blight the association during @entity11 ’s tenure			1
@entity172 , @entity7 : in february , an investigation by @entity7 's academics ended in the club once again being stripped of university status - it is expected to reapply for admission to the university later this year as social secretary , @entity11 had earlier helped to organise a black tie dinner at the @entity175 in @entity181 in june 2009 , attended by former defence secretary dr @entity123			1
but the gentleman ’s club was furious that a £ 1,200 debt from the night remained unsettled for more than two and a half years , finally being paid only earlier this year			2
it was @entity11 ’s job to collect cheques for the event			2
in february , an investigation by @entity7 ’s academics concluded that the ‘ financial and administrative officers of the association did not reach the standards required of a recognised student club ’ and the association was once again stripped of university status			1
it is expected to reapply for admission to the university later this year			2
a third row broke out in june 2010 , when a female student was heckled during a debate held by the association			0
@entity201 was told to ‘ shush ’ because ‘ you ’re a woman ’ by a member of the audience , who then started chanting ‘ kitchen , kitchen , kitchen , get back to the kitchen ’ and ‘ go back to washing the dishes ’			0
@entity11 became an active member of the @entity5 , which numbers mr @entity6 , mr @entity99 and @entity97 mayor @entity212 as former members , late in his university career , rising to become president during his final term			1
famous faces : the @entity69 has been a nursery for future @entity66 stars since it was founded in 1924			0
its patron is @entity221 , left , a former president , and the honorary president is foreign secretary @entity223 the @entity5 has been banned from meeting within 15 miles of @entity7 since a notorious dinner in 1927 during which members smashed every window in a college quad			1
the club maintained its controversial reputation in june 2010 , at the end of @entity11 ’s second year at @entity7 , when police were called to the @entity233 hotel near @entity234 , @entity235 , following reports that club members had broken glasses and pulled pipes out of a bathroom			1
they also investigated claims of criminal damage to a sports car			0
the event had been booked under a false name – a club tradition – because hotels and restaurants tend to be wary about its riotous reputation			0
@entity69 , which boasts two prime ministers , 13 cabinet ministers and three leaders of the @entity66 among its alumni , has been a nursery for future @entity66 stars since it was founded in 1924			0
its patron is @entity221 , a former president , and the honorary president is foreign secretary @entity223			0
@entity8 , a devout @entity257 , who is married with two other children , built his fortune through @entity260 , a hedge fund			2
in november , he and his wife , @entity262 , had dinner with mr @entity6 in the @entity90 flat which no 10 described as ‘ a social dinner for strong and long - term supporters of the party , with whom the @entity267 has a strong relationship ’			2
he took over as the @entity10 ’ co-treasurer last month			0

he added : ‘ i was not present at the hustings when racist jokes were made			0
i was not present at the event in june 2010 where sexist jokes were made			0
@entity282 dinner bill had nothing to do with me due to the fact that i had no access to the accounts and i was not told that the bill had not been paid until november last year , which is when the issue arose			0
‘ my decision to not run for presidency of @entity69 was affected by the repeated incidents of misconduct by the members which i considered to shed a bad light on an institution that was affiliated with the national party			0
‘ i absolutely objected to the racist remarks made at the hustings when i became aware of what had been said			0
hence my full support for the expulsion of the society members who made the remarks ’			0
a @entity27 spokesman declined to comment , but a party source said : ‘ @entity21 has clearly behaved entirely appropriately at all times			1
