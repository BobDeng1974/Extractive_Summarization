by @entity0 for @entity1 frustrated drivers have been slammed by the police for risking lives when they turned around on a motorway and drove the wrong way up a slip road to avoid lengthy tailbacks			1
motorists were caught on camera spinning their vehicles around and exiting the @entity12 via the entry slip road after a three - car smash near junction 2 , not far from @entity16 , @entity17			1
but drivers who turned around said their actions were pure ' common sense ' , while those who could not said they were jealous			1
he said : ' we were one of the last people to get off that way			2
luckily we were right by the slip road when the traffic stopped			1
' @entity47 , it saved us a lot of time			0
people who were less lucky were stuck there for hours			2
' we were very relieved			0
it was a pack mentality but it got us out			0
' @entity53 was driving along the @entity12 with his brother at the time of the crash and was less lucky			1
he said : ' i would n't have minded that at all			0
it would 've been very nice to have got out of there early			0
i do n't blame them			0
' @entity61 witnessed the chaotic scenes from a footbridge and told the @entity64 : ' once one started , they all turned around in the motorway and headed up the on ramp			2
' it was bizarre , complete mayhem , loads of bumps and irate drivers			0
' a pedestrian could also be seen walking up the on ramp at @entity75 as cars and vans weaved around the gridlocked traffic			0
traffic officers eventually brought the free - for - all to an end by blocking the slip road			1
@entity53 was among hundreds of drivers stuck in the tailbacks for more than two hours three cars were involved in the crash near junction 2 , not far from @entity16 , @entity17 luckily nobody was seriously injured in the crash , but the tailbacks caused chaos for commuters @entity90 , head of public affairs at the @entity93 , said he could ' see the thought process ' of the drivers who turned around , but drivers should wait for instruction from the police			1
he said : ' i have sympathy with the drivers			0
you can understand the frustrations of people stuck in these situations			1
they probably thought they were doing the right thing			0
' i can see their thought process , but i can not encourage people to turn around on the motorway			2
' there could have been a motorbike zipping down the slip road , or another emergency vehicle trying to attend the crash			1
' what the police do n't need in these incidents is chaos upon chaos , so the right thing to do is wait for instruction from them			2
' the @entity125 condemned the drivers ' actions and said nobody should ever drive in the wrong direction unless directed to do so			1
the offence is punishable by three penalty points and a fine			0
a spokesman said : ' i appreciate that when there is an accident people want to try to get to where they are going , but it does n't help anybody if people take it upon themselves to turn around and drive the wrong way up a motorway			1
' we do have a system of releasing traffic if it has been there for a while , where vehicles will be properly directed and it is done in a safe and controlled manner , whereas people turning round of their own accord and not under direction probably is n't			0
' if somebody turns and drives the wrong way down the road and has a secondary accident that means we then have to deal with that too and the road is closed for longer for everybody else			2
' nobody was seriously injured in the crash			0
@entity90 , from the @entity93 , said he ' understood the thought process ' of drivers who turned around after the crash , but said he would not encourage doing it himself turning around on the motorway can earn drivers three points on their licence and a fine			1

dozens of motorists turn around on motorway and drive up slip road after smash blocked @entity12 for hours
police warn of dangers of driving the wrong way , but people caught up in the chaos say it was just ' common sense '
@entity93 ' understand drivers ' frustrations ' but does not condone their actions
