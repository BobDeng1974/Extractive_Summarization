a @entity2 engineer has built the world ’s smallest electric scooter which can fold down to fit inside a work bag in just 10 seconds - or be pulled along like a large briefcase			1
but despite its small size , the scooter can reach a speed of 12mph ( 19km/h )			2
when a rider is using the vehicle , the scooter stands at four feet tall ( 125cm ) and three feet ( 97cm ) long			0
but it can collapse to just one foot in height ( 32cm ) and one foot 10 inches ( 57cm ) long when folded up – small enough to stash in a bag and to fit beneath the seat , or in the overhead compartment on a train			1
it weighs 26lbs ( 12kg ) and has a range of almost 10 miles ( 16km ) before the battery requires a charge			1
the electric vehicle is fitted with a @entity29 battery and a permanent magnet brushless engine			2
mechanical engineer @entity31 from @entity32 in the @entity2 , said : ‘ as far as we know , it is the most compact vehicle in the folded state			2
‘ it can be folded in just ten seconds and it can also be unfolded in another ten seconds			0
the 53 - year - old came up with the idea for the compact vehicle when the company he was working for planned a move away from the railway station to a new location			0
speedy : when a rider is using the vehicle ( pictured ) , the scooter stands at four feet tall ( 125cm ) and three feet ( 97cm ) long			0
the vehicle can currently reach speeds of 12mph ( 19km/h ) , but the final model could be faster depending on local regulations top speed : 12mph ( 19km/h ) but this could be altered prior to launch size when extended : four feet ( 125cm ) tall and three feet ( 97cm ) long size when folded : one foot ( 32cm ) tall and one foot 10 inches ( 57cm ) long weight : 26lbs ( 12kg ) range : 10miles ( 16km ) on a single charge charge time : a few hours estimated price : £ 800 ( $ 1,350 ) ‘ most employees travelled by train to work , so i was figuring out how they could reach the new office five miles ( 8km ) from the railway station , ’ he said			1
@entity31 hopes that charge time will be a few hours when the scooter is ready to be sold and estimates it will cost around £ 800 ( $ 1,350 )			2
‘ we have planned a speed of 12mph ( 19km/h ) but it could also be faster or slower , depending on local regulations , ’ he said			0

it can also be easily pulled along like a small suitcase ( pictured ) a commuter 's best friend ? a @entity2 engineer has built the world 's smallest electric scooter which can fold down to fit inside a work bag - or be pulled along like a large briefcase ( pictured ) ‘ it is great because it is both compact and clean so you can take it inside your house or office without soiling the interior , or taking much space			1
‘ this prototype is not the final production design , but we expect the charge time to be about a few hours , comparable to your mobile phone			0
‘ the price strongly depends on the numbers that can be produced			0
the larger the numbers , the lower the price can be			0
’ small : the electric scooter - pictured stashed inside the boot of a small car - can be folded in just ten seconds and unfolded in the same time , according to the investor			1

an engineer from the @entity2 built the electric scooter which has a range of 10 miles ( 16km ) before its battery needs charging
he designed it as a way to reach an office not too near to a train station
the vehicle can reach 12mph ( 19km/h ) and weighs 26lbs ( 12kg )
it folds up small enough to fit in a small suitcase , under a train set or in an overhead compartment - as well as in a car boot
there is no date for launch , but the scooter could cost around £ 800
