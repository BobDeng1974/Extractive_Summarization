by @entity0 @entity2 lawyer @entity1 is fighting for customers to get the difference between charges for credit card late fees and the true cost to the bank a multimillion - dollar payout could be handed to customers hit with excessive credit card fees in the biggest class action in @entity14 history			1
the class action to claw back excessive late payment charges of up to $ 35 could potentially impact hundreds of thousands of customers of @entity14 's biggest banks			1
law firm @entity2 is filing lawsuits against @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 in the @entity23 on tuesday , reported the @entity24			1
the action is set to take in @entity21 subsidiaries @entity27 and @entity28			0
it is expected similar lawsuits against @entity31 , @entity32 , the @entity33 and subsidiary @entity34 will follow , bringing the number of affected banks to nine			0
the action against the banks will see all of their customers who have been slugged with excessive late fees automatically included in the claim			1
this makes it hard to predict the potential payout amount although if successful it is expected to be in the hundreds of millions			0
there is no time limit on how far back claimants can go to recoup their fees , yet @entity20 will ask the court to impose a limit next week			2
' we 'll be alleging as we have in our earlier case against the @entity20 that the late payment fees are penalties and excessive , and customers should get the difference between what they were charged and the true cost to the bank , ' he said			1
unlike previous bank class actions which were ' closed classes ' and meant victims needed to register to be involved , the current action is an ' open class '			0
more than 180,000 customers have already registered , which could result in a $ 223 million payout			0
@entity2 has previously had a partial victory against @entity20 in a @entity80 case running for about four years and has filed similar class actions the @entity33 , @entity31 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
the class action is the biggest in @entity14 history and aims to claw back excessive credit card late fees of up to $ 35 in february , justice @entity86 found @entity20 's credit card late fees of up to $ 35 were ' extravagant and unconscionable ' as the cost to the bank was a low as 50 cents and that the fee was a penalty			1
she also waived the standard six - year time limit for legal action so there were no constraints on claiming late fees beyond this period as customers did not know the bank 's fees were unlawful until the lawsuit was filed in 2010			1
yet she did throw out claims against the bank that overlimit and dishonour fees were excessive			0
exception fees net the banks billions of dollars , with late credit card fees making up about 25 per cent of this amount			2
in 2012 , the @entity109 ruled as part of the bank fee action that it was possible for bank fees to be penalties			2
@entity20 and @entity2 will challenge the original credit card late fee ruling in the @entity80 on monday			1
although the exact amount of victims is not known , if successful the payout could be in the hundreds of millions if the law firm is successful and the court strikes down additional bank fees , it is expected the firm will lodge more class action suits and this could see the payout amount increase			2
yet if @entity20 wins , the lawsuit filed today would be quashed			2
in a third possible scenario , if the decision previously made to waive the usual six - year limit is overturned , the amount claimed by victims could be cut			0
new lawsuits by @entity2 will be financed by litigation funder @entity133 , which will take 22.5 per cent of any winnings , pending court approval			0
without the funding , a source close to the lawsuit said it would have been impossible to run the bank fee cases because each victim 's losses total a few thousand dollars in most cases			0
this amount is too small warrant costly individual court cases against the banks , which are some of the biggest companies in the country			0
lawsuits are being filed against @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 today in the @entity152 @entity23			1

bank customers could get millions paid back as part of class action
lawsuits are being filed against @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 today
the class action is the biggest in @entity14 history
it aims to claw back excessive credit card late fees of up to $ 35
