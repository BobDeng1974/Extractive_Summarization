@entity0 , known as @entity1 , 21 , died this week after taking a lethal overdose of diet pills this week , a 21 - year - old university student died after taking a lethal dose of diet pills			2
@entity0 , known as @entity1 , ' burned up from the inside , after swallowing the highly - toxic substance known as @entity9 , or @entity10			1
after taking the tablets her metabolism began to soar and she started to overheat			2
while doctors desperately tried to stabilise her , she died just three hours later			0
her mother issued a stark warning about buying diet pills online , saying her daughter never intended to take her own life , she just did n't understand the danger of taking an overdose of the tablets			2
here , dr @entity22 , a senior lecturer in chemistry at the @entity24 , explains how @entity10 came to be used as a diet pill , and why it the chemical is so dangerous … writing for the conversation , dr @entity22 said : @entity30 was the latest of a string of young people to fall victim to the chemical 2,4 - dinitrophenol , known as @entity10			1
it is a very dangerous chemical and scientists have been aware of this for nearly a century			1
during @entity37 , @entity10 was sometimes used to fill armour - piercing shells , as a mixture with picric acid , known as @entity41 or @entity41			1
an explosion in a munitions factory at @entity44 in @entity45 in 1916 was attributed to the chemical			2
just like @entity48 it was found to be toxic to the munitions workers handling it			1
many of them lost weight dramatically and some even died simply by absorbing it through their skin			0
the commercial use of @entity10 is as a pesticide or herbicide and , in 2009 , 11 workers in a @entity58 chemical factory – plus nine of their relatives – contracted @entity10 poisoning , their skins turned yellow or even black and two died			1
after @entity37 , scientists at @entity67 investigated @entity10 to see if it was a useful slimming aid			1
they established that the chemical boosted metabolism by up to 50 per cent , leading to considerable weight loss without dieting			2
@entity0 , known as @entity1 , ' burned up from the inside , after swallowing the highly - toxic substance known as @entity9 , or @entity10 @entity1 's mother said her daughter never intended to take her own life , she just did n't understand the danger of taking an overdose of the tablets			1
@entity1 is pictured in 2001 however , they also found out that there were a number of side effects ( including cataracts ) and that the safety margin was too slim			1
firms started selling it direct to customers which meant that people were taking it without medical supervision – and fatalities resulted			0
when one man died , they measured his temperature – it was 110 ° f ( 43 ° c )			0
@entity10 was banned in the @entity97 under the @entity98 of 1938 ; the @entity99 said that @entity10 was too toxic to be used under any circumstance			1
@entity101 , 51 , has issued a stark warning against diet pills following her daughter 's death @entity10 went underground for years , but it was again marketed in the 1980s as a " weight - loss without dieting " drug – and , more recently , the internet has given it a wider circulation , describing it as a " safe weight - loss drug "			1
extravagant claims were made by people who said that they lost 20 pounds in 12 days by taking it ; it was promoted as ' the king of the fat - loss drugs '			0
and of course the health problems and fatalities associated with its use returned			0
not for human consumption how @entity10 works was discovered in 1948			1
the chemical helps to move protons across membranes in cells			0
this results in a reduction in the production of @entity132 ( adenosine triphosphate , the molecule that transports energy within cells , the body 's ' energy currency ' )			0
this means that much of the energy usually generated in respiration is instead wasted as heat ( which can lead to fatal hyperthermia )			0
the body compensates by speeding up metabolism in order to produce the energy needed to maintain the body			0
this increase in metabolic rate results in the consumption of fat and carbohydrate as they are turned into energy			0
the people marketing it may hedge around with labels saying " not for human consumption " , but obviously consumers do not get the guidance that would be given if they were getting a medication from their doctor			0
a 27 - year - old woman who wanted to lose weight bought some over the internet ; she wanted faster results so she took double the recommended dose			0
there have been a number of fatalities in the @entity174 caused by @entity10			1
in 2013 , an 18 - year - old rugby player named @entity176 died after taking @entity10			2
scientists warn @entity10 is highly toxic			1
it was originally used in weapons in @entity37 and is used commercially as a pesticide the preceding year a 28 - year old @entity181 bodybuilder , @entity180 , died after his temperature rose to 42 ° c when he consumed @entity10 at his gym			1
that same year a 23 - year - old @entity185 medical student , @entity184 , died after consuming @entity10 that she 'd bought over the internet			2
her father said : ' for those who are selling it , if you have any ounce of decency , you must stop			0
' in 2004 the @entity193 advised consumers not to take any product containing @entity10 at any level : " this chemical is not suitable for human consumption			1
" all sorts of promises are made on the internet about @entity10			2
but if something sounds too good to be true , then it probably is n't			0
in the case of 2,4 - dinitrophenol , it 's also deadly .			0

@entity10 was a chemical used in weapons in @entity37 and was found to be toxic
it was also commercially used as a pesticide and poisoned workers
was banned as a diet pill after scientists discovered its risky side effects
has been linked to a string of deaths as it causes people to overheat
