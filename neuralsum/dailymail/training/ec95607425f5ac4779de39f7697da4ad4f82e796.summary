by @entity0 @entity1 said busy lifestyles mean people are forgetting to collect ashes the remains of dead @entity6 dating back more than half a century are lying unclaimed on the shelves of funeral homes and crematoriums because people are ' too busy ' to collect them			1
in one case , a family - owned funeral home in @entity11 has more than 200 boxed remains collecting dust on its shelves , and its company director is squaring the blame on people 's modern lifestyles			1
@entity1 from @entity20 said people 's ' fast - paced lifestyles ' are making them forget to claim their loved one 's ashes			1
' i think from our perspective most of the reasoning ( people forget ) is that we live in a fast - paced world and people do n't take five minutes for anything , ' he said			1
' everyone is too busy and they put things in front of them , and forget others			0
' the oldest ashes of a person he has date back to the 1950s , and because he was never instructed how to dispose of the remains with dignity , he feels obliged to keep them			1
unclaimed funeral ashes are sitting on the shelves of funeral homes across @entity6 it 's creating a moral dilemma for directors of funeral homes more generally who are hoarding unclaimed urns and are unsure of what to do with them			1
mr @entity1 said laws in @entity11 require funeral homes to hold on to ashes for two years , at which time they can choose how to dispose of them			1
he said family members can collect ashes ' days within the cremation ' and if they are not collected straight away the funeral home usually gives people up to a year before making contact			2
' we give next of kins and families the time they need to collect them , ' he said , which could be anywhere from six to 12 months			0
' we must show that we have made reasonable attempts to contact the family and it is then up to the individual funeral home , crematorium or cemetery how they want to dispose of them			0
' more than 200 ashes are waiting to be collected at @entity20 but mr @entity1 said out of dignity for the deceased , he usually holds onto them and in some cases people do eventually remember			2
' last year there was a lady ... who came back for her son 's ashes and he died in 1969 , ' mr @entity1 said			2
' the lady who had made the inquiry was making a general inquiry and she did n't think for one moment he might still be here			0
' he said people should not allow busy schedules and lifestyles to cloud their memories and family members need to talk about wishes after they die			0
mr @entity1 said some of the the most elaborate send offs are often the best			0
' we have had some amazing things done , ' he said			0
' one person asked to be frozen into a block of ice and dropped into the water so that as it melt the ashes drifted in to the sea			0
