a lot of women bemoan the constant presence of sexual images in advertising , particularly the over sexualisation of women to sell products to both sexes			2
however , new research shows that while women do exhibit negative reactions to sexual imagery , this diminishes for high value products that are viewed as exclusive or designed for the elite			1
it seems women do n’t mind sex being used to products we deem as high - end , rare and glamorous , and psychologists suggest that this is because it mirrors their view of sex in general			1
research has shown that women instinctively have a negative reaction to overtly sexualised advertising evolutionary psychology suggest that women dislike sexual imagery as it diminishes the value of sex , making it more likely their partner will cheat the study , conducted by the @entity38 and published in @entity39 , a journal of the @entity41 , suggests that evolutionarily women have a vested interest in sex being portrayed to men and other women as something special and rare , something to be highly valued			1
perpetuating this view makes it less likely that another woman will attempt to hoodwink your partner into bed , or that your man will stray , leaving him attached to and providing for you and your children			0
‘ women generally show spontaneous negative attitudes toward sexual images , ’ says psychological scientist @entity56 , a researcher at the @entity57 at the @entity38			1
‘ sexual economics theory offers a reason why : the use of sexual imagery is inimical to women ’s vested interest in sex being portrayed as infrequent , special , and rare			2
’ @entity68 in an old @entity70 tv advert in which she gets the brush off by a group of men , who favour a pizza instead of her women do n't seem to mind sexual imagery if it is associated with a high value product @entity56 and colleagues predicted that women ’s negative attitudes toward sexual imagery might soften if sex is depicted in a way that is consistent with the values of sex being seen as highly valued and of great worth			1
this @entity89 swimwear may not offend women , despite being very sexual as it is for a brand seen as high - end and exclusive sexual imagery may be less off - putting to women , for example , if it is paired with high - priced consumer goods , which can convey exclusivity and high value			1
to test this prediction , @entity56 and colleagues @entity102 and @entity104 had male and female participants come to the lab and view advertisements for women ’s watches			0
in some of the advertisements , the watch was presented with a sexually explicit image , whereas in others the watch was pictured with a majestic mountain range			0
importantly , some of the ads priced the watch at $ 10 and others at $ 1,250			0
to measure the participants ’ gut reactions toward the ads , the researchers had them memorize a 10 - digit code before viewing the ads , a cognitive distraction designed to prevent them from thinking too deeply about the ads. then , after reciting the code , participants were asked about their attitudes and emotional reactions toward the ads. overall , women who saw the sexual imagery with the cheap watch rated the ad more negatively in comparison to women who saw the sexual imagery with the pricey watch			2
these negative ratings seem to be driven by women ’s negative emotions — feeling upset , disgusted , unpleasantly surprised , or angry — in response to the ad that paired sexual imagery with the cheap watch			0
men , on the other hand , reported similar reactions to the sex - based ads , regardless of the advertised price of the watch .			0

research by @entity38 , published in @entity39
showed women have instinctively negative reaction to sexual adverts
however do n't mind when used for high - end , rare or *expensive* products
report suggests it might be because women fear sex being *devalued*
