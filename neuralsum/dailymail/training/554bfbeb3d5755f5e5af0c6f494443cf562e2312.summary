the twelfth will be @entity24			0
@entity2 begins rehearsals today ( monday ) for a musical version of @entity14 ’s controversial @entity27 about @entity4 a fictional 1980s @entity16 investment banker who engages in twisted , sick , sadistic , misogynistic fantasies involving rape , mutilation , torture and cannibalism			1
‘ it ’s a damn difficult role to pull off and @entity2 has charm and the acting chops to do it ’ , a source close to the production told the @entity38			1
‘ it ’s bold casting and brave for @entity2 to take it on ’ , the source added			2
the show , which starts previewing at @entity19 ’s @entity18 on december 3 , has been described as a satirical commentary of the materialism and greed that marked the @entity8			0
characters are deeply concerned with looks , fashion , money and status and care for little else			0
if the show garners critical acclaim , it will transfer to the @entity53 , and eventually @entity54			0
there are already @entity57 producers involved			0
@entity2 ’s casting has been shrouded in secrecy with just a handful of the musical ’s creative team being in the know			1
cast members were n’t being told who their leading man would be until rehearsals start today			1
although @entity2 ’s an accomplished stage actor , having starred on the @entity19 stage in dramas such as that face , @entity70 , leading a musical is an altogether different business			1
classic : @entity74 , pictured , played @entity4 in the 2000 film adaptation of @entity76 @entity2 ’s known to be a strong singer but he has had a series of singing lessons to stretch his vocal range , to make it easier to get through eight performances a week			1
plus , he will need to be able to shake it up on the dance floor because the show ’s director @entity85 , has introduced several dance numbers			0
the score by @entity89 , who wrote the show @entity91 , features songs that celebrate @entity4 ’s obsessions with fashion and food			2

in the novel @entity4 prepares for his grisly deeds by citing lyrics from songs by @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			2
although @entity89 has written an original score it ’s not yet known whether elements from songs connected to those singers will be incorporated into @entity13 in some way			2
in the book , a shocking indictment of yuppidom , @entity4 ’s crimes become increasingly repellent and when fellow workers see him splattered with blood he jokes his way out if it by claiming the blood is cranberry juice			2
when he introduces the topic of serial killers in conversation his listeners think he ’s referring to the cut and thrust of mergers and aquisitions			0
a movie version of @entity13 , with @entity74 as @entity4 , was able to shock without resorting to showing the most graphic and repugnant aspects of @entity14 ’s book			1
@entity136 , who has adapted the story for the stage , described the show as a ‘ perverse , dark , twisted version of the @entity141 ’ while director @entity85 called it ‘ very sexy and really stylish '			0
