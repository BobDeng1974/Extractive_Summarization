by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 01:32 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 08:23 est , 31 july 2013 @entity2 revealed today it made £ 23 every second from its customers in the first six months of 2013 and hinted at more price rises			1
after raising its prices just before last year 's record - breaking cold winter , the energy giant raked in a £ 356million profit from households during the first half of this year - up 3.2 per cent on 2012			1
as people cranked up the heating to deal with plunging temperatures , residential gas consumption alone soared by 18 per cent during the first four months of 2013			0
the news has led to consumer groups demanding they freeze the price of gas and electricity to ensure households can afford to keep warm this winter			1
parent company @entity2 also enjoyed bumper profits of £ 1.58billion for the past six months - up nine per cent - causing its shares to rise sharply this morning			1
profits hike : @entity2 's residential arm made £ 356million in the first half of this year , up 3.2 per cent facts : a huge rise in revenue from households driven by a price increase and freezing conditions helped @entity2 increase residential profits to £ 356million its profits would have been higher but were held back by a new duty to pay for energy efficiency measures in customers ' homes , which helped push environmental costs up 37 per cent for the period			1
@entity2 warned that the scheme , which has landed it with a £ 1.4 billion bill , would ' inevitably impact on customer bills ultimately ' and that it was facing ' upward pressure on costs '			2
finance director @entity49 said : ' we will keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can			0
if prices do have to go up , we will delay it for as long as possible			0
' today consumer group @entity53 said @entity55 gas should not raise its prices again this year			0
' the fact that @entity2 has absorbed increasing costs so far this year will be of cold comfort to consumers who may be fearing the worst – especially with rumours of price rises			0
profits are up from last year , so we would urge @entity2 to help quell customer 's fears and go one step further from its may pledge and commit to a price freeze for the rest of the year , ' spokesman @entity63 said			1
' people are already starting to worry about next winter and the cost of their energy bills and high energy prices have a big impact on consumers			1
last winter , almost seven in ten households went without heating at some point to keep their energy costs down			0
' but @entity2 maintain they are giving consumers a good deal			0
chief executive @entity85 said : ' with our customers using more gas to stay warm during the unusually cold winter , we 're doing everything we can to help them keep their energy costs under control and make bills simpler and clearer			0
' cashflow increase : a drop in average temperatures in @entity55 helped @entity2 increase its profits today 's announcement of its half - year financial results are likely to spark anger as it is revealed how @entity2 boosted its bottom line via the steep bills landing on customers ' doorsteps in the wake of the freeze			1
the earnings announcement comes a day after @entity108 - owned energy firm @entity107 said its profits had risen to a record £ 903million in the wake of the cold spell			2
@entity2 's rise in profits does not entirely reflect gains from heavy winter gas usage , which are likely to have been offset by the cost of a new obligation to deliver energy efficiency measures in customers ' homes , analysts said			1
boss : @entity2 's chief executive @entity85 pledged to ' keep energy costs under control ' the company has been the subject of sustained hostility as it awarded multimillion - pound pay packets to executives while customers have struggled to pay rising energy bills amid the economic downturn			2
its results announcement also comes as new rules on simpler energy tariffs provoke an industry backlash			0
rival provider @entity138 said the changes would ' add cost and complexity to energy suppliers ' relationships with customers '			0
in june , @entity2 muscled in on the @entity55 's potential shale gas boom by buying a 25 per cent stake in the @entity148 exploration area , paying £ 40million cash and pledging tens of millions in further funds for the venture , which is operated by @entity152 .			2
