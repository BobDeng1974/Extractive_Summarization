families should do their @entity3 shopping now because a shortage of lorry drivers has raised fears that there could be empty shelves in the shops , the @entity0 said last night			1
thousands of hauliers have quit over the past few months following a new @entity12 rule forcing them to sign up to expensive training			1
in an interview , @entity15 said he ‘ hopes and thinks ’ there will be no problems in the next six weeks , before adding : ‘ but i ’d advise everybody to get their shopping done			1
deliveries of presents bought online from firms such as @entity40 could also be affected , hauliers warn			2
and @entity3 meals could be affected because perishable vegetables could be delayed			1
the @entity12 ’s new training rules mean the logistics industry is 60,000 drivers short , according to the @entity46			1
and the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) claims 20,000 drivers have either taken early retirement or moved to different jobs since the certificate of professional competence became mandatory in september			2
the qualification involves 35 hours of training and costs up to £ 300			2
drivers who do not hold it risk a £ 1,000 fine			2
@entity57 , managing director of the @entity47 , said : ‘ this is the first @entity3 when we have had this requirement and many drivers are saying , “ i did n’t take up truck - driving to go back to school ” and just voting with their feet			1
’ @entity66 , of the @entity67 , said : ‘ there is a possibility that shelves will empty and be slower to fill this @entity3			1
‘ we always see people stocking up at @entity3 as if the shops are going to be closed for two months			1
‘ it is the perishable goods – the big bags of mandarin oranges , the vegetables that go with the turkey			0
all of the perishable goods have a rapid turnover and a short shelf life			0
we have got to make sure those shelves are filled			2
’ @entity83 's shadow transport secretary @entity82 hit back at the comments , branding them ‘ out of touch ’ @entity87 , managing director at logistics recruitment company 24 - 7 staffing , said : ‘ it ’s a crisis			0
@entity3 could be put on hold			1
’ and agencies that provide extra drivers during the pre-christmas peak say they have no more to spare			2
meanwhile , @entity96 , of @entity97 , which represents online retailers , said there were signs that less - experienced drivers were being used to meet the shortfall			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve had a delivery of wine that has failed to turn up three times			0
when i queried it i was told , “ terribly sorry we ’ve got a temporary driver on ”			0
’ in an interview with the @entity111 website , mr @entity15 admitted there was a shortage of lorry drivers			1
but he defended the @entity12 ’s new training requirements , saying : ‘ if you ’re driving a motor vehicle , with the investment you ’ve got in that motor vehicle , it ’s no bad thing to know what you ’re doing			2
’ new rules mean all lorry drivers must undergo 35 hours of training at a cost of £ 500 , but many have left the industry altogether asked whether he would be doing his @entity3 shopping early , he said : ‘ no. i ’d rather not go in to my @entity3 present list			1
i ’m actually a bit better prepared this year than i am most years			0
my wife ’s very worried about it			0
i ’ve told her i ’ve sorted her present out			0
’ last night , sources close to mr @entity15 said the @entity3 shopping warning was only a ‘ light - hearted exchange ’			1
‘ we do n’t think there ’s any real concern , ’ the source said			0
‘ driver training makes our roads safer , helping the delivery of presents on time			2
’ in a @entity145 debate last month , @entity143 mp @entity142 warned : ‘ the country faces a national shortage of 40,000 qualified @entity149 drivers , which is acting as a brake on national economic growth			0
’ @entity152 , from the @entity46 , has said : ‘ because logistics underpins the operation of so many other businesses we often do not think about it by itself , but its overall contribution to the economy is huge			0
’ @entity160 needs between 45,000 and 60,000 extra lorry drivers , according to estimates			0
there is a long - running shortage caused by drivers retiring and too few young people choosing haulage as a career			1
and since september , all drivers must obtain the @entity170 , completing an extra 35 hours training , costing some £ 500			1
under the new rules , drivers who do not hold the new certificate face a fine of £ 1,000			1
as many as 20,000 drivers are thought to have quit or retired as a result			0
the @entity67 wants chancellor @entity178 to offer funding to train a new generation of drivers - especially women - in next month 's @entity182			1
however , the comments have shone a spotlight on a crisis in the industry , with too few people choosing a career in haulage			2
@entity152 , from the @entity46 , has said : ' because logistics underpins the operation of so many other businesses we often do not think about it by itself , but its overall contribution to the economy is huge			0
' as over 60 per cent of goods in the @entity160 are moved by road , driver shortages would cause serious knock - on effects to the rest of the economy			0
' a spokesman for online market place @entity204 said deliveries were crucial to the consumer market			0
the spokesman said : ' getting delivery right is absolutely important which is why more than half the items sold by businesses large and small on @entity204 offer free delivery and a range of fast delivery options			0
' more and more , customers are choosing @entity217 and on @entity204 there are millions of items available for convenient collection from over 650 @entity222 stores throughout the @entity160			0

new training rules for drivers have led to thousands quitting the industry
@entity67 there could be ' empty shelves ' this @entity3
@entity15 says people should ' get their shopping done '
plea comes despite there still being six weeks to go until @entity3
could affect online shopping and @entity239 shops
