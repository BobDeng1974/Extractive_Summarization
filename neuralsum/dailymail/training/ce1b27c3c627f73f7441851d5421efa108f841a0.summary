the second day of @entity0 got off to a stylish start with bold blooms , chic black and white and striking floral prints all challenging for dominance in the style stakes			1
but even the bright floral prints could n't compete with the sea of spectacularly large hats that flooded @entity0 - with even the @entity9 plumping for a pretty mint green , purple and pale pink @entity14 creation , worn with a mint green crepe coat and a multi-coloured floral silk dress by @entity17 , and a diamond and emerald brooch			1
once again the monarch looked on jaunty form as she arrived for the second day at the races , again accompanied by her eldest son @entity23 and his wife , the @entity24			0
but not everyone was enjoying the day			0
along with bookmakers who were forced to pay out on multiple colours for the second day in a row , racegoer @entity26 was left miserable after being ejected from the @entity31 by @entity0 's fashion police			1
lovely : the @entity9 looked summery with a floral print lilac blouse beneath her green coat , while the @entity35 chose a striking nude and cerise hat stunning : @entity38 arrived on the arm of her husband , @entity40 , @entity40 , while @entity41 was bold in brights lady @entity41 turned out in a bold outfit complete with turquoise nail polish and quirky matching beret hat glamorous in green : both the @entity9 and the @entity24 plumped for verdant shades , which @entity9 livened up with a vibrant pink , purple and green hat striking : former heptathlete @entity52 was pretty in an austere black and white ensemble but jazzed things up with a huge pair of jet and gold drop earrings applause : racegoers cheered as the @entity9 was driven past the @entity60 before she alighted with the @entity61 at the @entity31 out ! a furious @entity26 was evicted from the @entity31 by the @entity0 fashion police because of her too - short skirt racegoers traditionally have a punt on the colour of the hat she will wear on @entity68 , being staged tomorrow , when female racegoers wear even more outlandish hats and outfits then usual			1
@entity72 believes she will wear a blue hat and makes the colour its 3 - 1 favourite			0
but punters have been backing purple and its odds have fallen from 8 - 1 to 5 - 1			0
the 52 - year - old milliner was left furious after her skirt was deemed too short and branded @entity0 staff ' rude ' and called the decision ' preposterous ' as she left			2
yesterday fellow milliner @entity84 was also thrown out for wearing unbecoming headgear after he tried to sneak in wearing a gargantuan floral wreath underneath his top hat			2
one who made a more delicate choice was the @entity24 whose cream hat was pretty when teamed with an on - trend pea green coat worn over a floral print tea dress			2
her husband meanwhile , looked dapper in a grey suit enlivened with a lilac silk tie and waistcoat			0
the @entity35 also put in an appearance , watching the parade from the @entity99 and sporting a wonderful nude and cerise straw hat , which was stylishly combined with a knee - length wrap dress			0
lady @entity41 , meanwhile , decided that more was more when it came to colour and chose an ensemble that combined a violet and yellow dress with a bright turquoise blue hat			0
while @entity38 was flying the flag for elegant neutrals as she arrived on the arm of her husband @entity113 , former heptathlete @entity52 was stunning in stark black and white , and there was no shortage of style in the paddock			1
can one see a winner ? the @entity9 watches thoroughbreds in the parade ring accompanied by the @entity24 and her racing manager @entity121 fascinating : the @entity122 at the second day of the @entity123 ( left ) and a racegoer opts for tomato red wrap dress and feathery headpiece ( right ) @entity127 riding @entity128 ( center ) leads the way and wins the @entity131 during day two of @entity0 passionate racegoers cheer on their horses today , some happy while some are angry women clad in mini-dresses look confused by another racegoer 's choice of fuchsia full - length gown today @entity140 opts for a red lace bird hat while in the @entity31 @entity142 : @entity145 tycoon @entity144 's statuesque wife , @entity143 , brightened up a grey day in her flamboyant frock - as did the bold choices of other racegoers double whammy : @entity150 who was pictured in a fuchsia bush inspired hat yesterday plumped for a sunny golden yellow ensemble on day two supersized : for many female racegoers , more was most definitely more in the hat department as they stunned onlookers on day two of @entity0 ornate : four racegoers show off their stunning embellished headgear as they laugh together during a great day out at the @entity0 race meeting stylish : @entity160 was stunning in a spectacular multi-layered fascinator which combined two of @entity0 's top trends : monochrome and big blooms while many plumped for bright crimson , yellow and cerise , cobalt and royal blue topped the colour charts - perhaps inspired by the @entity9 whose favourite colour it is			1
others , meanwhile , plumped for prints with delicate blooms proving the most popular			0
dance group , the @entity179 , appeared for a second day , this time in gorgeous yellow rose print dresses and buttercup boleros , topped off with wonderful sunflower splashed hats			0
already a dominant trend on day two , big blooms were splashed around the racecourse on day one as well			2
among the most successful interpretations were the huge floral headpieces , including one that resembled a fuchsia bush			0
yesterday 's event also saw the royals joined by a succession of celebrities including @entity196 soprano , @entity195 , who chose a bold orange dress and @entity199 hat , and @entity201 's girlfriend , @entity200 , who was spotted in a Â£ 155 whistles dress and @entity204 shoes			0
others to appear on day one included veteran racing pundit , @entity206 , @entity208 's wife @entity207 , who looked gorgeous in a pale pink lace dress and @entity210 , @entity211 , who was elegant in monochrome			1
like the royals and celebrities in attendance , the majority of racegoers chose elegant looks in line with @entity0 's strict style rules , which include a ban on strapless dresses , sheer clothing and any form of fancy dress			1
@entity225 , 20 and @entity226 , 23 @entity227 lean back in a couple of deckchairs the @entity31 on day two of @entity0 race goers sitting on the grass and relaxing in the @entity232 at @entity0 daring : while some more daring racegoers opted for shorter hemlines , feathers and intricate cutwork proved particularly popular for others on day two of @entity0 blooming lovely : the @entity179 arrive for day two of @entity0 sporting pretty rose print dresses and huge sunflower splashed hats @entity241 : this group of gaily - dressed racegoers have almost all plumped for one of summer 's hottest trends - stunning block colour smart : @entity248 is proving a popular choice for racegoers , with some plumping for classic block colour while others attempt a more daring look in pretty floral print elegant : a vintage @entity257 is the perfect backdrop for a @entity0 breakfast picnic			1

and he was n't the only one to attempt to bend the style rules			0
from giant comedy hats to too - short skirts and sky high platform heels , some @entity0 racegoers appear to need a recap of the @entity0 style rules			2
if you 're heading to the @entity31 tomorrow , here they are in full : ladies gentlemen girls overseas visitors @entity318 source : royal @entity0 best dressed ? smartly dressed racegoers arrive for day two of @entity0			2
