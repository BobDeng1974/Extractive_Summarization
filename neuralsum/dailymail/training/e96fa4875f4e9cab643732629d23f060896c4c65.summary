the number of confrimed @entity2 cases has passed the 10,000 mark according to the @entity4 claiming the lives of almost 5,000 people			1
the @entity8 health agency warned however that this landmark figure may be inaccurate due to significant under reporting of sickness certain parts of @entity13			1
the @entity4 fears that many people in the poorest parts of @entity13 are refusing to come forward for treatment because they are scared			1
it has hit @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			2
as well as a reluctance in coming forward , the @entity4 complained that there are not enough laboratory capacity to handle the large volume of potentially infected blood samples			1
this backlog could also lead to an under reporting of the outbreak			1
according to the @entity4 the number of confirmed , probable and suspected cases of the disease is now 10,141 with 4,922 fatalities			1
the number of suspected cases has increased by 200 over the past four days			2
on thursday , authorities confirmed that the disease had spread to @entity42 , the sixth west @entity13 country affected , and on the same day a new case was confirmed in @entity44 , in a doctor recently returned from @entity23			1
@entity42 had long been considered highly vulnerable to the disease , since it shares a border with @entity23			1
the disease arrived there in a two - year - old , who travelled from @entity23 with her grandmother by bus and died yesterday			1
experts feared that @entity42 was vulnerable to the @entity2 as it shares a border with @entity23			2
authorities have set up a screening station on the border , but it failed to identify a two - year - old girl who later died of the disease the @entity8 has airlifted more than one tonne of medical supplies into @entity42 to cope with any outbreak the toddler , who was bleeding from her nose during the journey , might have had high - risk contact with many people , the @entity4 warned			1
so far , 43 people are being monitored in isolation for signs of the disease , and the @entity4 said authorities are continuing to look for more people at risk			1
the @entity42 president @entity71 said he will not close the border to @entity23 despite the @entity2 threat			2
it has emerged that the girl travelled hundreds of kilometres through @entity42 - including a stop in the capital @entity78 - on public transport , potentially exposing many people to the virus , before she died in the western town of @entity83 on friday			1
@entity71 said that the incident showed it was impossible to completely seal his country off from @entity2 in neighbouring @entity23 but said he remained calm as the girl 's journey and potential contacts had already been traced			2
he told @entity89 : ' @entity23 is @entity42 's neighbour			2
we have a shared border that we did not close and we will not close			0
' land - locked @entity42 relies on the ports of neighbouring @entity94 , @entity23 and @entity95 as gateways for much of its import needs			0
there is little accurate data but border closures by @entity13 states trying to protect themselves from the epidemic have had a crippling effect on regional economies			0
these workers are busily constructing a new treatment centre for @entity2 on the outskirts of @entity110 , @entity24 @entity71 said that the girl 's grandmother had made a mistake by going to a funeral in @entity23 , where more than 900 people have died of @entity2 , and bringing her back			1
he said : ' we are paying dearly for this			0
but i think this will cause more fear than anything else			0
the case was quickly contained			0
' local and international @entity2 experts are rushing teams to @entity42 to help try to contain the outbreak in the sixth @entity13 nation to record @entity2 this year			1
@entity94 and @entity127 have contained outbreaks and been declared free of the disease			1
diplomats and health experts say the girl appears to have had @entity2 - like symptoms and travelled for four days before she was eventually diagnosed with the disease on october 23			1
ebola cases are contagious as soon as they show symptoms			0
the @entity4 said that 43 contacts had been identified and isolated			1
but a @entity42 health official , who asked not to be identified , said authorities estimated that at least 300 people had been in contact with the infected child			1
@entity71 added : ' we will do everything we can to avoid panic			0
i notice that @entity78 is calm today			0
' to help fight @entity2 , the @entity8 humanitarian flight service airlifted about a tonne of medical supplies to @entity42 late yesterday			0
the seats of the plane were removed to make room for the cargo , which included hazard suits for health workers , surgical gloves , face shields and buckets , according to the @entity159 , which runs the flights			0
@entity161 , @entity13 regional director with the @entity8 food agency said : ' speed is of the essence in this @entity2 crisis			0
agencies such as @entity159 and @entity4 are working every hour to confront together the virus as a matter of priority			1
' @entity44 and @entity170 have implemented stringent quarantine restrictions for suspected new cases in the @entity27 , a women who arrived on a flight to @entity170 from west africa showing symptoms of the disease has tested negative to @entity2			2
@entity170 @entity178 said the woman remains under observation and in isolation at @entity182 in @entity183			0
she is a health care worker who arrived yesterday from @entity13 , where she had contact with @entity2 patients			0
she initially showed no symptoms of the virus but later developed a fever			0
the woman , who arrived at @entity193 , became the first traveller to be quarantined under an @entity2 watch in @entity44 and @entity170			0
president @entity196 has tried to promote calm by hugging @entity199 nurse @entity198 who survived the disease the governors of those states had announced a mandatory 21 - day quarantine of medical workers and other airline passengers who have had contact with @entity2 victims			2
the move came after a doctor who returned to @entity44 a week ago from treating @entity2 patients in @entity23 fell ill with the virus			0
many @entity44 were dismayed to learn that in the days after he came home , @entity212 travelled on the subway system , took a taxi , went bowling , visited a coffee shop and ate at a restaurant in the city of eight million			0
@entity170 governor @entity220 and @entity44 's @entity221 said the case led them to conclude that the two states needed precautions more rigorous than those of the @entity227			0
the @entity228 recommends monitoring of exposed people for 21 days but does not require quarantine			2
mr @entity221 said : ' it 's too serious a situation to leave it to the honour system of compliance			0

@entity4 fears the actual outbreak figure could be higher
almost 5,000 people have died from the disease since the outbreak started
the current outbreak of the disease is the largest in *history*
