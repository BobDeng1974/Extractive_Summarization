@entity0 arrived in the most isolated city in the world on saturday to find a familiar face waiting and ready to put on a show for them in front of a sell - out @entity8 crowd			1
@entity9 has been like @entity11 ’s ghost at @entity0 ’s feast ever since they sacked him and on sunday he will have the perfect opportunity to show them what they are missing when he plays in the @entity18 semi-final			1
a number of @entity0 players are expected to watch @entity9 ’s @entity22 take on a @entity24 side including @entity25 in a last - four contest in the massively successful @entity29 @entity28 competition			1
@entity9 is enjoying his cricket as he plays for @entity22 in @entity29 's @entity18 competition @entity9 is gearing up for a @entity18 semi-final match against @entity24 on sunday a delicious irony has brought the man who has haunted @entity0 ’s progress all year to @entity36 at the same time as his former team - mates , who will face @entity38 here in a @entity41 match on friday which they need to win to make sunday ’s final			1
@entity9 has made a big impact in the @entity18 — causing problems for @entity0 along the way by saying that @entity47 would love him in his side — and has charmed an @entity29 audience who , without the benefit of the full facts , find it hard to see how @entity0 can ignore such an extravagant talent			1
a relaxed @entity9 talked on saturday of his enthusiasm for an @entity29 franchise competition that has shown the way forward for an @entity28 game that has been left lagging behind			1
‘ i ’ve absolutely loved it , ’ said @entity9 of his time in @entity60			1
‘ what i ’ve loved is how competitive the cricket is , which is what i ’m sure you expect when you come to @entity29			2
@entity9 criticised the reduced salary cap in @entity68 cricket , saying they are lagging behind @entity29 @entity9 will be watched by some of his former @entity0 colleagues when he plays on sunday ‘ the way the tournament is run , the time between the games , living in @entity60 playing for a brilliant franchise and just having such a good bunch of guys			1
the coach and management have been sensational and everybody has been treated exactly the same			0
we ’ve had just the best time			0
’ there was clearly a message to @entity0 in there somewhere			2
as there was , too , when @entity9 was asked if @entity0 could learn from the @entity18 , which on saturday saw a crowd in excess of 52,000 at the @entity87 for @entity89 ’s semi-final victory over the home side			1
‘ i think so , ’ said @entity9 , without a county in @entity0 since his release by @entity93			1
‘ they can learn because the franchise system does work			2
everybody has made it work			2
i think playing once a week does n’t work in the @entity99 , especially if you want to get good players in the teams			2
i tried it last year and found it very hard playing once a week			2
’ @entity9 struggled for form in the wake of his exile from @entity0 for both @entity93 and @entity108 in the @entity109 but he has been much more like his old self in scoring three half centuries for @entity60			1
@entity9 , playing for @entity22 , bats during the @entity18 against @entity113 @entity9 ( right ) puts his arm around @entity115 as they leave the field of play on january 17 ‘ when you play more you can practise more and be part of a team environment			1
and your eyes are consistently picking length			0
with batting it makes a huge difference			0
and my knee — my knee was horrendous for the last 18 months			0
’ @entity9 now has to decide whether he wants to be anything more than a @entity28 mercenary			2
‘ i need to seriously figure out what i ’m going to do , ’ he admitted			0
but whether he has a future in an @entity68 county system where the salary cap has just been reduced remains to be seen			1
@entity9 does not approve of the cost - cutting measures that emerged last week			2
‘ what ’s frustrating is they say they want to help home - grown players , ’ he said ‘ but the best way to make them become better is to play against better players			0
find a way to franchise county cricket			0
you would have 10 counties or franchises who play each other in @entity28 or one - day cricket			0
the former @entity0 man admits that he needs to decide what he is going to do with his career @entity9 says @entity68 cricket need to find a way to franchise county cricket , labelling players ' muppets ' ‘ all the muppets who are on £ 18 grand , £ 15 grand , either you become better or you go and do something else			1
the best players would play against each other week in week out			0
that ’s how you become better			0
you do n’t do that by reducing salary caps			0
’ perhaps not surprisingly for a man who no longer plays the ultimate form of the game , @entity9 expressed concerns about the future of test cricket			1
‘ the last couple of months have been the first time i ’ve started to worry about @entity172 , ’ he said after @entity60 ’s last practice session ahead of sunday ’s match			0
‘ kids have got no interest in test cricket			0
look at how they are filling these stadiums for @entity18 cricket			1
they are all kids and you speak to them at the end of a game and you say “ would you come to a test match ? ” and they say “ no ” ! none of the kids want to block			0
they want to switch - hit , they want to hit over extra cover , they want to slog a six first ball			0
it ’s sad but that ’s the way of the world			0
