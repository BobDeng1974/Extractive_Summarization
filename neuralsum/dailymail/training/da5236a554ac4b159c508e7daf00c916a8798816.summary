@entity0 slapped down one of his civil service aides over the tweet claiming @entity4 was ' probably not guilty ' business secretary @entity0 has been forced to rebuke one of his top @entity7 aides for claiming @entity4 was ' probably not guilty ' of rape - despite the footballer being tried and convicted for the crime			1
@entity11 , private secretary to the business secretary , made the controversial remark on his personal @entity15 account while watching @entity17 's @entity16 last night			1
the @entity19 graduate , said he would ' query how many have looked at the details rather than symbolism of rapist - footballer '			1
he added : ' if guilty then never a footballer again – role model argument – but on the facts of the case , probably not guilty			1
' as a civil servant mr @entity11 is not supposed to post messages online about controversial topics			1
official guidance states : ' we should avoid commenting altogether on politically controversial issues and avoid making any kind of personal attack or tasteless or offensive remarks to individuals or groups			1
' in april 2012 , @entity4 was jailed for five years for raping a 19 - year - old before being released last year			1
a spokeswoman for @entity0 said : ' the member of staff regrets his actions and has apologised			1
we now consider the matter closed			2
' mr @entity11 's remarks , reported in the @entity46 , emerged as @entity4 hit out at the ' mob ' for scuppering his deal to sign for @entity49			2
the disgraced striker , 26 , claimed pressure from ' radical elements ' meant a new stand at @entity49 and several jobs would have been put at risk if had he joined			2
it came as the head of the @entity59 @entity58 was forced to apologise after he compared the plight of the convicted rapist to the 96 victims of the @entity64 disaster			2
yesterday @entity4 apologised to the woman he raped for the first time but maintained he is ' innocent ' of attacking her in a @entity69 hotel room in 2011 and said he will appeal the conviction			2
@entity4 , pictured holding hands with his fiancee @entity72 yesterday , has apologised to his rape victim for the first time but has maintained he is innocent and in an attack on those who opposed his return to football with @entity49 said : ' sadly the ' mob rule ' tactics employed by the more radical elements of our society and the constant media reporting has had the desired influence on some sponsors and the club would face significant financial pressure if i joined them			2
' the most significant issue for me was that owing to the threat of funding opportunities being withdrawn which may jeopardise the building of @entity49 's new stand , it would mean that workers would lose their jobs and others would be put at risk - that would simply not be fair			0
' meanwhile @entity58 , chief executive of the @entity59 , sparked outrage after making the ' insensitive parallel ' in a radio 5 live interview following the announcement that @entity4 ' move to @entity49 had collapsed			0
mr @entity58 , 70 , told @entity104 : ' he would not be the first person or persons to have been found guilty and maintained their innocence and then been proved right			1
@entity58 , chief executive of the @entity59 , is facing calls to resign after comparing the plight of convicted rapist @entity4 to @entity64 ' if we are talking about things in football we know what happened , what was alleged to have happened at @entity64 and it 's now unravelling and we are finding it was very different to how it was portrayed at the time			0
indeed by the police at the time			0
' his comments , comparing the problems faced by convicted rapist @entity4 sparked calls for him to resign			0
responding he said : ' the last thing i intended to do was to upset anybody connected with the @entity64 case because i 've long been a supporter of them			1
' so if that 's the impression they got it 's a totally wrong one and i 'm very sorry for that and that 's not at all what i intended			0
' i was intending to show it as a campaign to prove the reality of what happened and how determined they 'd been and how much i admired them			0
@entity4 is a totally different case but he has the same belief in his innocence			1
' mr @entity58 said it appeared ' very doubtful ' @entity4 would play football in this country again			0
' at this moment in time you would have to say you would be very doubtful of that , ' he told @entity151 's today			0
' it may well be that he would have to go abroad but at the moment , because he is out on licence he ca n't go abroad			0
' so we need a serious rethink now after the way that this has divided opinion			0
' the union boss said the former @entity160 and @entity161 striker is in a ' very difficult situation ' which has been made worse by @entity49 's decision to scrap a deal to sign him			1
he said : ' he 's been put through a wringer and the moment you show any sympathy for @entity170 , everybody will say , ' what about the other parties concerned ' , and that 's why i 'm making the point that nobody 's forgetting them .			0
