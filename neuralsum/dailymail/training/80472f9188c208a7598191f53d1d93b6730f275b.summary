the @entity0 plotted twice to assassinate president @entity1 during the years before the @entity2 because the agency was angered when ' @entity4 ' turned dovish and began to withdraw troops from @entity6 , according to an explosive book from a longtime @entity1 confidant due for release on monday			1
one hit was planned to occur at @entity1 's @entity11 , @entity12 vacation house			1
a second plot to kill him was to culminate during a @entity16 speech in 1972			0
when both plots failed , writes best - selling author @entity18 in ' @entity19 : the @entity20 , fall and @entity21 about the president , @entity2 , and the @entity23 , ' the @entity0 settled for driving @entity1 out of office by sabotaging the watergate break - in			1
' the president was supposed to be assassinated , ' he quotes @entity36 saying in his book			0
' the first place he was supposed to be assassinated at was in @entity11 , the second place was when he was supposed to give a speech at the time of the @entity48 [ @entity48 ] convention in @entity50 1972			0
' ' veteran @entity0 assassin @entity51 was to supply the weapons to assassinate @entity1 with			1
' @entity51 , an @entity54 revolutionary , had killed for the @entity0 before , but @entity18 claims he and fellow @entity0 contract killer @entity55 backed out of the mission when they learned who they were expected to kill			1
@entity18 said he obtained @entity51 's papers from his son @entity61 , who has his own book in the works			2
' @entity51 's @entity64 : and his @entity65 , @entity2 & the @entity66 , ' will be published in october			0
' i got confirmation from @entity51 's papers , ' he told @entity37			0
@entity18 claims in his book that @entity36 , who died in 2005 , told him that @entity51 and @entity71 ' both insisted that they had not been informed that @entity1 was the target until after the intended weapon was obtained			1
' ' both @entity55 and @entity51 insisted they had been led to believe that they were to execute a " communist " ' at the @entity48 convention , he writes that @entity36 told him			0
' @entity51 balked when he realized it was a domestic political hit			0
' ' @entity1 secrets ' is due on bookshelves august 11 and promises to shake up the historical understanding of the only @entity83 president to resign his office he went to the @entity85 in @entity16 instead and the plot fizzled			2
@entity18 's claims are documented in part by an email from @entity90 in which the assassin 's son writes that his father had recalled talking to the @entity0 's @entity95 idea was to ' create a shoot - out using the @entity97 and the @entity98 ' – anti-war student radical groups – ' and the other " hard core commies " they were so worried about , ' he said his father had explained			1
' the people i spoke to were going to put some of this equipment in their hands , ' the elder @entity51 had said , according to his son 's email reproduced in @entity18 's book , ' and some in law enforcement hands , and use some of the local vigilantes to start a shoot out			0
' ' this would finally straighten out @entity114 as to where the priorities were on overcoming the " domestic communist menace "			0
' the planned diversion was n't the @entity0 's first plot to rub out @entity1 , @entity18 claims			1
in the email he publishes in ' @entity19 , ' @entity90 wrote that a @entity0 operative named @entity122 told his father how associates of @entity124 , a @entity126 emigre who had been involved in a @entity0 - led – and @entity1 - approved – plot to kill @entity128 , ' had a scheme to ... [ fire a ] missile at the compound ' in @entity11 where the president was staying			1
' they were gon na take out @entity1 and put @entity134 in power , ' @entity122 concluded , suggesting that the @entity0 was also involved in that conspiracy			2
some of the same @entity0 operatives involved in the @entity1 assassination plots – including @entity139 , @entity71 and @entity122 – were later planted among the @entity2 burglars , @entity18 explains in ' @entity19			1
' ( for the conspiracy - minded , ' @entity19 ' also notes that @entity122 had been @entity33 assassin @entity142 's case officer at a naval air station in @entity144 , a point of origin for top - secret u- 2 spy plane flights			0
) the @entity0 , he claims , inserted its own people among @entity1 's ' plumbers ' over time with instructions to make rookie mistake after rookie mistake			1
@entity0 theory : @entity18 says many of the @entity2 burglars including @entity155 ( @entity156 ) , @entity55 ( 2nd l ) and @entity158 ( 2nd @entity159 ) were also @entity0 operatives who were also involved in the @entity33 assassination boom : @entity1 's @entity11 , @entity12 vacation home , shown in december 1971 , was to be turned to rubble with a missile strike , according to @entity18 's book ' @entity19 ' their bumbling , which @entity18 claims as intentional , turned a professional surveillance operation of the @entity170 headquarters into what history would regard as a ' third - rate burglary			1
' ' when they tried twice to get him killed , that does n't work , ' @entity18 told @entity37			0
' then they infiltrate the watergate break - in , and they sabotage it			0
' @entity36 , the @entity40 lawyer who first told @entity18 about the assassination plots , had been a longtime aide to sen. @entity179 , a moderate @entity39 who assembled his own dossier on @entity0 involvement in the @entity2 affair			2
@entity179 tried in vain for months to use that information to spark new committee investigations – which @entity187 blocked at every turn			0
' @entity179 ’s incredible report was in the back of a 600 - page book gathering dust at the @entity193 , missed by the media and largely unknown until today , ' @entity18 claims in his book			0
when the senator later looked into the relationship between the president and his @entity0 director , @entity199 , he summed it up by remarking that ' @entity1 and @entity199 have so much on each other , neither of them can breathe			2
' ' @entity1 also aggravated the @entity0 , ' @entity18 told @entity37 , by demanding their records of of the @entity33 assassination , which he wanted as leverage over the agency			1
' the president ' was furious when cia director @entity199 refused to hand over the files , ' @entity18 said			2
the late former sen. @entity179 ( @entity156 ) , who died two months ago , amassed evidence that the @entity0 infiltrated the gang of @entity212 burglars and purposely set them up to be caught , all in order to being down the president ' @entity19 ' is hefty at 661 pages , but readable and – mercifully – it requires little advance knowledge of the 1960s and 1970s , or the @entity2 saga , to comprehend			2
the book includes a longish but entertaining introduction to @entity1 's political life			2
@entity18 , at one time the youngest staffer at @entity1 's the infamous committee to re-elect the president , is clearly fond of his subject but makes no attempt to whitewash his crime and cover - up that spiraled out of control and ended his presidency in 1974			1
killer ? @entity55 , one of the @entity2 burglars , was one of two @entity0 assassins recruited to kill @entity1 , according to @entity18 's book and he explains clearly why the @entity0 would want @entity1 out of the way and his later - disgraced vice president , @entity134 , at the helm			1
the @entity0 and the @entity83 military @entity238 were ' at war ' with @entity1 in 1969 and 1970 , @entity18 claims , because ' they were opposed to the withdrawal of troops from @entity6 , they were opposed to the @entity242 [ arms limitations ] agreement with the @entity245 , and they were opposed to the opening to @entity247			1
' recalling the mood when @entity1 entered the @entity249 in january 1969 , @entity18 told @entity37 that president @entity31 had frustrated his spies and generals by ' trying to conduct the war personally , picking bombing targets and so on			1
' the @entity0 and the @entity254 , he said , ' felt handcuffed			0
' ' so now we 've got a real hard - liner in @entity1			0
he 's going to let us really go after the @entity257 , ' @entity18 imagined them thinking			0
' but of course that 's not what happens			0
@entity1 wants to get out of there , and they 're violently opposed to that			0
' ' their motivation is to upset this detente			0
' in 1969 , he writes in his book , top military brass were even running a spy ring inside the @entity249 because they were ' desperate to know what @entity1 and [ his national security chief @entity273 were up to			1
' in december 1971 , @entity276 , a twenty - seven - year - old navy stenographer assigned to the @entity277 , working closely with both @entity278 [ his deputy @entity275 , confessed to sifting through burn bags of top - secret @entity249 documents and delivering these documents to the chairman of the @entity238 , admiral @entity282 , ' @entity18 writes			1
the naval @entity283 was ' going around copying documents , rifling desks – he actually goes through [ @entity273 ] @entity273 's briefcase – copying everything and sending it to the @entity238 , ' @entity18 said .			2

@entity0 and military @entity238 infiltrated the @entity249 and spied on @entity1 , the late former president 's longtime confidant @entity18 writes
the agencies wanted room to run in @entity6 but @entity1 turned dovish and began a troop withdrawal after his *stunning* @entity249 *victory* in 1968
two separate plans were drawn up to kill him
@entity299 , *quickly* dismissed , was a plot to fire a missile at @entity1 's vacation compound in @entity11 , @entity12
the other involved a staged **gun*fight* at an @entity307 convention where @entity1 was to speak , with an assassin shooting him in the chaos
the @entity0 obtained a *gun* and hired an assassin , but he refused to proceed when he found out who his target was
