the @entity8 cross was rescued by staff at @entity10 last month and walked on her wrists because her front legs had not formed properly			1
but after care and attention from staff at the charity , physiotherapy helped to straighten out her legs			2
now @entity1 , now known as @entity19 , has been adopted by professional dog walker @entity20 and was pictured yesterday enjoying a run near the family home in @entity24			1
wonky , renamed @entity19 , has found a new home with @entity20 and her family in @entity24 the @entity8 cross puppy cut a pitiful figure when she was abandoned with malformed front legs			1
but now , after physiotherapy , she has new owners and a new leash of life miss @entity20 , 21 , said : ' we 've renamed her @entity19 because the staff at the @entity10 did n't give up on her and helped her recovery			1
' about 600 people applied to the charity to offer the puppy a new home			1
miss @entity20 said : ' i was gobsmacked when we heard we had got her as i knew there would be hundreds of applicants for her			2
' we filled out a form anyway , and now here she is			0
we are over the moon			0
@entity19 now shares the family home with miss @entity20 , her parents @entity0 , 50 , and @entity51 , 53 , and 18 - year - old sister @entity52 , as well as three - year - old chocolate labrador @entity53 , three guinea pigs , two tortoises and two fish			1
it is the third time the family has adopted a pet from @entity10			1
miss @entity20 said : ' we feel so lucky to have been able to offer @entity1 a home			1
' luckily we live close enough to the centre for the vet to continue to keep an eye on her , and she continues to get better every day			0
' we fell in love with her when we saw her story and she has fast become part of the family			2
' @entity19 enjoys her walks and sleeps at the end of miss @entity20 's bed			1
' i think she is a very mischievous personality and affectionate , she loves to cuddle			0
' although she is the family 's dog she is my baby			0
' mrs @entity20 , also a professional dog walker , said : ' she 's a good dog and has been out for walks with the other dogs			2
she is a bit frightened of going out at night though			0
' when the world was first introduced to hope last month , she cut a pitiful figure			0
she was given the nickname @entity1 because of severe problems with her malformed front legs , which failed to develop after she was separated from her mother			1
but after intense physiotherapy , the 12 - week - old made a fantastic recovery			0
where once she walked awkwardly on bent joints , she can now bound along normally , her tail wagging as she goes			0
wonky when she was first rescued ... wonky , disabled by malformed joints , was found dumped on a street in @entity96 last month ... and after a fortnight with @entity98 since physiotherapy , the @entity8 cross has made remarkable progress @entity102 , a vet at the @entity10 in @entity96 , told how the puppy was taken there on february 9 with contracted flexor tendons on the back of her front legs - leading to a condition known as ' knuckling '			1
@entity111 of the carpal joints is caused by contraction of the tendons which prevents the wrist joint from extending fully - and meant her front feet bended inwards because her tendons were too short			2
he said that without treatment , it would have been impossible for @entity19 to straighten her legs			2
she was found wandering the streets as a stray and was taken to the @entity10 by a member of the public			2
because of her unorthodox looks , there had been concern she would struggle to find a new home			0
there were 600 offers from households wanting to take care of @entity1 and after a thorough vetting process she was rehomed with the @entity135			0
@entity136 , manager at the trust , said : ' the @entity20 family proved to be an excellent match for the puppy			1
' we are confident that the love and care the family can provide will ensure she has a very happy life			0
' with further physiotherapy , the prognosis for @entity19 is good , and the trust wanted to rehouse her close by so it can keep her under review			2
the @entity150 renamed the puppy @entity19 , because the staff at @entity10 did n't give up on her ' it 's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she 'd had the right love and care , ' ms @entity153 said previously			1
' she had not had the right supplements to enable her to grow properly and so her front legs were too weak			1
' we do n't know everything about her background but we think that she was removed from her mother too early and was then abandoned			0
she had not had the right nutrition and a poor diet meant her front legs were underdeveloped			1
' she will need regular trips to the specialist vet to keep a track of her progress			0
' it 's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she 'd had the right love and care , ' said @entity136 , manager at the trust ' with the right treatment , she will hopefully be able to live a normal life and do all the things a puppy should be able to enjoy			0
@entity10 is the @entity179 's largest dog welfare charity and cares for more than 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year through its network of 18 @entity182 across the @entity179 and one in @entity184			2
@entity185 , spokesman for the charity , said : ' usually , physical deformity is the result of unscrupulous breeders or they have n't been properly looked after and most of the time it 's something that is completely preventable			0
' staff at the charity hoped to rehome the puppy near them so they can keep up her care			0
