an @entity1 man , whose @entity3 husband of almost forty years died in 2012 , made a renewed pitch on monday for a green card after the @entity7 administration eased policies on gay marriage			1
@entity10 , 72 , asked federal immigration authorities in @entity12 to reopen a 1975 petition filed by his late husband @entity14 , which would grant him residency as the surviving spouse of a @entity3 citizen			1
mr @entity10 and mr @entity14 met in @entity12 in 1971			1
they wed in 1975 after hearing about a county clerk in @entity20 , @entity21 , who was giving marriage licenses to gay couples			0
@entity10 holds up his marriage license from his 1975 wedding to husband @entity14			2
though the marriage license was legally issued , the couple 's relationship was not acknowledged by immigration officials the men applied for a green card for mr @entity10 but were denied			1
the reason cited on the rejection letter was that : ' you have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots '			0
after the courts shot down their appeal , they left the country and stayed with friends in @entity42 in the mid- 1980s but soon returned to @entity43 where they lived until mr @entity14 died in 2012			2
mr @entity10 , who overstayed his visa , would have celebrated his 39th wedding anniversary on monday			2
the renewed immigration request comes less than a year after the @entity7 administration started issuing green cards to gay couples who marry			0
' it does n't matter how much time has passed and it does n't matter how long it took to figure it out , ' said immigration attorney @entity54			0
' he and @entity14 sustained a constitutional injury for 40 years , and that should be corrected			2
' @entity14 , left , passed away in 2012 in the couple 's @entity43 home			2
they would have celebrated their 39th wedding anniversary on monday @entity3 @entity14 and @entity1 @entity10 were married in 1975 and applied for @entity10 to get a green card			1
they were turned down on the grounds that their marriage was not legal @entity65 , a spokeswoman for @entity66 , declined to comment on the case			0
the agency that oversees immigration benefits began issuing green cards to married gay couples last year after a @entity73 ruling struck down a law that prohibited the federal government from recognizing married same - sex couples			1
since then , mr @entity54 said he has represented more than 100 couples seeking immigration benefits related to marriage , including those whose @entity3 spouse died before they got green cards			1
the difference in @entity10 's case is that his marriage predates the law , and the reason given for denying the couple 's petition was simple ' bigotry and discrimination , ' mr @entity54 said			0
@entity92 , the former @entity20 clerk , said she is amazed that issues surrounding gay marriage are still not resolved			0
she issued a marriage license to a first gay couple in 1975 after they were denied by a clerk in nearby , more conservative @entity99 , and the local district attorney said the law did n't bar her from doing so			0
' i really want to live long enough to see marriage equality across the country and not a piecemeal thing among the states , ' said ms @entity92 , who resigned after two - and - a - half years because of opposition to her decision			0
almost forty years after they were married in @entity21 , @entity10 has renewed his application for a green card , as the surviving spouse of a @entity3 citizen @entity14 filed for a green card for his husband , but was turned down on the grounds : ' you have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots '			1

@entity1 @entity10 , 72 , married @entity3 @entity14 in 1975
@entity10 applied for a green card in 1975 but the marriage was n't recognized
the pair lived in @entity43 until mr @entity127 's death in 2012
40 years after his *initial* application , mr @entity10 is applying to stay in @entity3
green cards can now be issued in the cases of same - sex marriage
