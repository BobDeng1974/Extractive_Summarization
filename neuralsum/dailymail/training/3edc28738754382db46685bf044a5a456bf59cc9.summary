one of @entity1 's trendiest areas might soon be home to a tent city			1
if this were another town , the owners and developers of high - end homes and condominiums would scream to high heaven about diminished property values			1
but this is @entity1 , where the citizens try their best to be tolerant of everything except intolerance - and gluten			1
protesting : developers and some residents are angry at plans to move the @entity20 in @entity1 , @entity21 , to a parking lot under the west ramp of the @entity24 opponents of a city plan to put 100 people under a century - old bridge in the @entity29 are carefully choosing their words when complaining about the prospect of new , down - on - their - luck neighbors			1
rather than express concern for their financial investments , they have criticized the city 's expedited process and worried for the welfare of those willing to live in a parking lot under the west ramp of the @entity24			2
@entity40 , the president of @entity41 , a realty and development firm that - over the course of 15 years - has helped transform a dying industrial area into a sparkling urban neighborhood , said ' throwing a bunch of people under a bridge ' should not be the city 's solution to helping the estimated 2,000 residents who sleep outside each night			1
' it 's embarrassing , because that is not how you would treat anybody , ' she said			0
mayor @entity57 and city commissioners plan to decide october 16 whether to move the camp to the @entity29 from its current home near the entrance to @entity62			1
if approved , a coalition of property owners promises to sue			2
the camp known as @entity66 ( @entity67 ) was established in october 2011 during the @entity69 movement			1
four years earlier , the city forced an adult bookstore to close because of code violations			2
the building was later demolished and the lot remained empty for three years until the aggrieved owner allowed the homeless to lease the property for $ 1 a year			1
each night for two years , roughly 100 people have slept on prime downtown real estate - in tents shielded from passers - by with a barrier of old , colorful doors fashioned into an artsy wall			0
during that time , landowner @entity86 racked up more than $ 20,000 in fines because of violations associated with operating a campsite without a permit			0
he responded with a lawsuit			0
@entity92 : the @entity93 is currently next to the @entity62 gate in @entity1 to extract @entity1 from this mess , city commissioner @entity96 brokered a deal in which the fines would be waived , the lawsuit dropped and the homeless campers sent to the @entity29			1
it all happened in a matter of weeks , angering homeowners and developers who say the city was so desperate to settle @entity86 's lawsuit that it bypassed zoning laws			2
@entity108 , a former psychiatric nurse , acknowledged that the camp is not the ideal answer to homelessness			0
she said there is not enough money to provide housing to all , and @entity67 has provided a much safer alternative than the street			0
' it 's been an option that 's been better than nothing , ' she said			0
scores of people spoke for and against the proposal at a recent five - hour hearing			0
though some older women testified their safety would be jeopardized , most @entity29 residents completely ignored quality - of - life and financial issues and repeatedly griped that the city did the deal in secret and delegitimized the zoning code			1
not everyone in the neighborhood is rich , they added , and the fight has been unfairly cast as the greedy against the homeless , or ' us against them			0
' ' it 's a sad , confrontational , divisive atmosphere because communication was intentionally closed , ' said @entity143 , a retired social worker who lives in the @entity29			2
besides condominiums and the low - income apartments for older residents , there are businesses nearby and a @entity149 is scheduled to open next year			0
those who have spoken to the potential financial impact of @entity67 say hotel guests wo n't want to stay near a shantytown and commercial rents could fall by more than 15 percent			0
home : the camp was established in october 2011 during the occupy @entity1 movement and is home to about 100 people @entity160 spent $ 20 million to build its headquarters in the @entity29			1
its real estate adviser , @entity162 of @entity163 , said in a phone interview that his client represents a large @entity167 apparel manufacturer that is considering @entity1			2
' what does my client tell the executive of that manufacturer when it asks : ' how can we trust you , @entity176 , with our brand when we come to @entity1 and see you invested $ 20 million next to a homeless camp ? ' ' homeless people , meanwhile , ask their prospective neighbors to give them a chance			1
@entity67 has an excellent safety record , and supporters say the camp - they call it a rest area - has helped people get back on their feet and into permanent housing			2
' we 're not there to bring property values down , ' said @entity191 , the @entity67 leader			1
' we 're there to get people from sleeping on your sidewalk			0
we 're there to stop people from sleeping in the doorways			0
we 're there to stop the drug dealing ; we 're there to stop the drug use by our friends			0
