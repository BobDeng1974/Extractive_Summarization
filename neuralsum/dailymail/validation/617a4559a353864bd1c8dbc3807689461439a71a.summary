@entity0 wants to prove a point to his critics after coming under fire for some poor performances at the heart of @entity7 's defence			1
@entity9 centre back @entity0 was widely praised for his water - tight partnership with @entity11 last season , and in the early stages of the current campaign , but his ability has been called into question with a few poor performances of late			1
@entity0 was poor for @entity7 in the @entity18 5 - 3 defeat by @entity20 at @entity21 and he allowed @entity22 to run unchecked for @entity24 's goal in the @entity26 semi-final first leg at @entity27			1
@entity0 wants to prove his doubters wrong by finding his best form again in @entity7 's defence @entity0 started and helped @entity7 keep a clean sheet in sunday 's @entity26 final win over @entity20 but having contributed to keeping @entity32 quiet and ensuring @entity7 kept a clean sheet to win the cup at @entity35 on sunday , @entity0 wants to show his worth all over again			1
' i have proved it time and time again			0
i proved it when i was at @entity39 and i got the @entity9 call - up			0
i was told " you ca n't play for @entity9 , you 're at @entity39 " , ' @entity0 said			1
' i proved them wrong			0
i came to @entity7 and it was " oh , you ca n't play @entity43 , you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that " and i proved them wrong			1
' @entity0 and his partner in the centre of defence @entity11 ( left ) pose with the @entity26 @entity49 ( right ) has emerged as a credible alternative to @entity0 in the centre of @entity53 's defence @entity0 's mixed form has coincided with the emergence of young @entity56 defender @entity49 , who has started in place of his more senior rival in some big games of late			1
but now the 29 - year - old wants to use his time back in the first team to help @entity7 to glory in the @entity64 and @entity43			2
' it 's that fire in your belly , ' he said			2
' although you 'd wish not to have it , dealing with criticism is probably what has got me to where i am today			0
i will come out the other end without a shadow like you see today			0
' @entity32 ( left ) gave @entity0 a torrid time on @entity18 but was well shackled at @entity35 ' that 5 - 3 defeat was a bad day at the office for the team			2
certainly since i have been at the club we have been fortunate enough to have positive results against @entity20			0
' it was said before sunday 's game that that result would have no reflection on the final and so it proved			2
i use it as motivation to prove people wrong time and time again			0
' you are not a robot			0
up until the halfway point in the season it was no problem â€“ but i have come through it time and time again			2
it 's not the first time i 've had have a dip in levels of performance			0
' @entity0 ( right ) and @entity104 ( left ) celebrate @entity11 's opening goal against @entity20 at @entity106			1

@entity0 has shown mixed form in @entity7 's defence this season
he has been in and out of the side , being *replaced* by @entity49
@entity0 started in the @entity26 final and wants to kick on from there
