by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 was floored seconds into his comeback fight as his hopes of quickly returning to world title level were shattered by defeat by @entity7			1
promoter @entity8 had challenged @entity2 to send out a statement against the unbeaten @entity10 but it was a far from positive signal as @entity7 secured a split - decision points win , although he appeared a clear winner			0
@entity8 had secured a @entity16 eliminator in the @entity18 's first fight since losing his @entity20 belt to @entity21 but it was the visitor who moved closer to fighting champion @entity23 and left @entity2 facing an uncertain future			1
shock : @entity2 was knocked down in the first round as he lost to @entity7 ouch : @entity2 recovered from the knockdown but lost on a split decision @entity2 was on the floor within 30 seconds when southpaw @entity7 , who had knocked out 13 of his previous 18 opponents , caught him with a counter left hook			2
the two - weight world champion looked shaken as he got up after the eight count and his diminutive opponent kept raining shots in			0
@entity2 looked in danger of being stuck on the ropes a couple of times in the early rounds and @entity7 's left hook caused the @entity18 problems throughout the fight , for the vacant @entity45 title			1
the @entity47 fighter managed to put together some combinations but none troubled the visitor , who generally responded with an intense flurry of punches			0
open : @entity2 was vulnerable to the @entity10 's left hook and lost for the second successive time another left hook had @entity2 in trouble in the fifth and , just when the 31 - year - old excited the @entity59 crowd with a decent right hook in the next round , @entity7 soon forced him back again			2
the @entity10 , fighting outside of the @entity62 for the first time , continued to brush off @entity2 ' replies and throw the more dangerous punches despite the @entity18 looking more steady as the fight progressed and winning several of the later rounds			0
@entity7 was awarded the win by 115 - 113 on two scorecards with one judge , @entity70 , giving @entity2 the victory by the same score , but there was no sense of injustice among the home crowd			0
backed up : @entity2 had hoped to set up a world title shot but that looks unlikely now			1

@entity2 was knocked down in the first round in @entity81
the @entity18 was *bidding* to *bounce* back from his defeat to @entity21
@entity2 looks unlikely to challenge for a world title again
