researchers have developed a method to activate electronic implants in the body and eliminate bacterial infections using a wireless signal			1
when triggered by remote technology , the gadget delivers heat to infected tissue			2
and it could lead to technologies that enable drugs and treatment to be delivered to patients at the press of a button			0
@entity18 researchers have developed a device to treat infections wirelessly			1
an electronic implant ( illustrated ) was activated by a wireless signal			1
it used a heater to treat tissue that had been infected with staph			1
and one researcher said it could be a precursor to drugs being delivered via @entity31 activation in the future the technology was developed by researchers at @entity35 in @entity36 and the @entity37			2
mice were given electronic implants that , when a signal was sent , heated up to treat tissue that was infected with staphylococcus , or staph , which can cause minor skin abscesses or life - threatening infections of the blood			1
tissues collected from the mice 24 hours after treatment showed no sign of the infection , while the device dissolved in 15 days , proving it can not only treat infections but also be disposed of easily			1
the research , which also eliminated e. coli bacteria , was published in the @entity56			0
the researchers at @entity58 demonstrated for the first time a dissolving electronic implant , made of silk and magnesium			2
it was used to eliminate bacterial infection in mice by delivering heat to infected tissue when triggered by a remote wireless signal			2
the devices then harmlessly dissolved			0
in vitro studies also showed the devices could kill bacteria by releasing antibiotics			0
this is an important step forward for future development of on - demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely to perform a therapeutic function , such as managing post-surgical infection , and then degrade in the body			2
each device , made of silk and magnesium , harmlessly dissolved in the animals after the tests			0
the heating device in the implants has a resistor and power - receiving coil made of magnesium , and the magnesium is wrapped in ' packet ' of silk , keeping it safe and controlling its dissolution time			0
the ability of the device to dissolve is important , as it means such implants would not need to be removed			0
implantable medical devices normally use non-degradable materials that have limited operational lifetimes and must eventually be removed or replaced			0
but these new wireless therapy devices can handle the surgical process , and can then dissolve in minutes or weeks , depending on the time needed			0
' this is an important demonstration step forward for the development of on - demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely to perform a therapeutic function in a patient and then safely disappear after their use , requiring no retrieval , ' said senior author @entity109 , professor of biomedical engineering at @entity111			1
' these wireless strategies could help manage post-surgical infection , for example , or pave the way for eventual @entity31 drug delivery			1

@entity18 researchers have developed a device to treat infections wirelessly
an electronic implant was activated by a wireless signal
it used a heater to treat tissue that had been infected with staph
this is a *potentially* life - threatening *condition* that affects the blood
the tests removed any sign of the infection in 24 hours
and the senior author of the study professor @entity109 said it could ' pave the way for eventual @entity31 drug delivery '
