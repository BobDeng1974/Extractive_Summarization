@entity1 officials have accused @entity3 airport immigration officials of deliberately refusing their star player @entity5 the right to play in the @entity7 match at the @entity8			1
former @entity9 winger @entity5 is not in the team to face @entity11 after allegedly arriving at the airport on tuesday with the wrong visa			1
the @entity14 was allowed in the country but not allowed to play in or even attend the match			2
now directors of the @entity18 club have claimed the decision was a deliberate act aimed at sabotaging @entity1 ’s plans for tonight ’s game in @entity23 @entity1 's @entity5 was told he could n’t play against @entity11 because of a visa issue according to sources in @entity18 , the former @entity9 player was only in possession of a ‘ transit visa ’ rather than the necessary work visa			1
as such he was allowed in to the country but told he could not play in the game or even travel to the stadium for the game			1
it is understood that @entity5 is currently at the @entity1 team hotel in @entity36			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , are considering an official complaint , feeling that their player has been deliberately targeted because of the threat he carries on the field			1
city need to win after taking only two points from their first three matches			0
@entity5 ( left ) apparently only had a ' transit visa ' and so was forced to stay at the team 's hotel during the match @entity1 general director @entity48 said : ‘ initially there was a discrepancy and he was issued not a tourist visa , but a transit visa			1
‘ the @entity55 consulate advised that @entity14 do not really need a tourist visa , they may arrive as transit passengers without a visa and it is issued on the spot			0
‘ nevertheless , the transit visa was issued , so he had the right to stay in the @entity62 for 48 hours , that is enough			0
‘ but the @entity55 border guards showed some over-adherence to the rules and found on the internet that he is a @entity1 player , and felt that he had come to @entity55 to work			2
‘ they demanded a wok visa , which is impossible and unacceptable			0
‘ after a long time of wrangling , he was admitted to the country because they had no right not to ( let him in ) , as he had a visa			0
@entity78 gives @entity11 the lead during the two side 's clash at the @entity82 in @entity83 ‘ however , they seized his passport , which is also the first time in our experience that a passport of a citizen of another country has been confiscated			2
‘ the @entity55 migration service has received several requests from the @entity14 consulate in @entity55 and the @entity18 embassy in @entity55			2
‘ they considered the matter at length and in the end , not only did he not go to the match , he was even forbidden to be a spectator at the stadium and they demanded that he leave the territory of @entity3 before the match			0
‘ will we submit a protest ? @entity55 people still ca n’t calm down , but , i think there is already no sense in it , because it already wo n’t affect the result , but it ’s not very pleasant			0
‘ i am sure that this would not have happened in any other @entity114 country			0
