sweetness : bake off star @entity1 has a vulnerability that 's won over @entity3 she would n’t look out of place as a kitchen maid on @entity6 as , with an etiolated elbow , she nudges one of her tawny curls out of her eyes , as green as a cat ’s			1
she ’d fit in perfectly on the catwalk at @entity15 , too , although the white powder often found on the end of a runway model ’s nose does n’t tend to be of the kind found on @entity1 ’s retroussé button : icing sugar , or self - raising flour			1
@entity1 has done some modelling , but unlike the catwalk queens , her arms have muscle definition , from kneading dough			1
in fact , @entity1 does n’t knead dough in the way i ’ve seen it done on food programmes before : she slings it at the bench despairingly , large eyes rolling at her own ineptitude			1
because @entity1 , rather than moaning ecstatically at her own creations in the manner of @entity40 and @entity41 and @entity42 ( can you imagine a writer doing the same ? ‘ oh , that last sentence of mine was perfection ! ’ ) , she has often , during the nine weeks of @entity37 , seemed about to waft off in her floral tea dress to find a convenient lake to drown herself in			1
i wonder she did n’t slope off to hang herself from the marquee ’s guy ropes , the day her @entity51 showed its innards			1
despite the fact she has made it to the show ’s final on tuesday , despite her extravagant beauty , and brains that are n’t made of bavarois , @entity56 seems to have no self esteem whatsoever			1
now that every young person has been brought up with the @entity67 attitude that we can all ‘ be whatever we want to be ’ , @entity1 is the mistress of a long lost @entity70 art of self deprecation			1
‘ it ’s burnt , ’ she wails , so the judges , @entity74 and @entity75 , have to console her , tell her that , no , it is not burnt , it is perfection			1
that no one this beautiful could possibly be genuinely down in the mouth			1
‘ like chocolate being prepared for a @entity94 topping , her false modesty is really beginning to grate , ’ wrote @entity90 in the @entity91			2
‘ you are c * * * at baking , ’ spat a viewer on @entity97			2
‘ your opera cake was rubbish			2
go back home @entity101 ’ ( @entity1 ’s caramel skin comes from being a quarter @entity103 )			2
@entity1 has developed such a habit of peering up from under that bird ’s nest of hair , almost afraid to find out the verdict on her baking , that many women have tweeted that she is letting the feminist side down by being so coy			2
many have accused her of flirting unashamedly with @entity113 , and that he in turn has given her brownie points ( literally , given her brownies points ) , which is nonsense			2
actually , i am all in favour of @entity1 being so down on herself			2
it is infinitely preferable , surely , to all those self - promoting third wave feminists who have self - belief oozing from every open pore , an oleaginous goo that makes them condemn any woman who is not like them , who does n’t flaunt her fat thighs in cut - off denim shorts , who prefers perhaps to crouch before any door of opportunity , afraid of what lurks outside when she musters the strength to open it			1
this criticism of our @entity1 beggars belief			1
take it from someone who knows : @entity1 ’s self doubt is genuine			2
i love that , rather than kneel before her oven , watching her meringues harden , you get the feeling she would rather just shove her head inside , and for it all to be over			0
it has become a curiously @entity70 sport , to abuse a woman online simply for being quietly good at what she does ( and @entity152 , too , her fellow contestant and closest rival in the final , gets abuse for being too cocky , for saying too often that she has ‘ plenty of time ’ , and has done her best )			1
tearful : @entity1 often breaks down in tears on the show and @entity3 says the baker 's self doubt is genuine and she is the ' poster girl ' for the shy never mind who is crowned champion this week , it seems you really can not win			1
but , fortunately for @entity1 , it seems if you prod her skin with a forefinger , it springs back into shape			0
she has responded robustly , @entity172 fashion , to offending tweets			0
‘ the unfounded , unfiltered , lazy ranting of a bitter old witch , ’ she typed in answer to one addled rant			0
she is determined only to focus ‘ on the good bits ’			0
@entity113 revealed in an interview last week that potential bake off contestants have to pass an examination with a psychologist before they are allowed to take part in the show , which is so successful it moves to @entity186 next season			0
this is coming to something , is n’t it : that to compete in a tv show about making cakes requires a tin foil exterior to ward off all those negative vibes			0
the world , once you stick your head above the parapet , has become intolerable			0
after @entity1 broke the glass bowl of her @entity202 ( does that date me , saying @entity202 ? should i have typed @entity205 ? will , now , the @entity200 be alive with barbs about how old i am , how i should go back to the @entity207 , perchance ? ) , and wailed that she was so embarrassed she could not go on with her baking , a new hashtag instantaneously sprang up : hashtag middleclassproblems			0
( sorry , i ’ve no idea where the sign for hashtag is on my keyboard , as i do not tweet , as i am far too busy having , you know , a life			0
) ah , so this is what women have been taking umbrage with : @entity1 should n’t moan because she does n’t have real problems , like mastitis , or a minimum wage job as a cleaner , or cancer			0
she has the use of all her limbs , and what gorgeous appendages they are , too			0
this derision of so - called middle class problems comes from the @entity232 school of thought : you know , that depression does n’t exist , that it is all in the mind ( ! )			1
stick a metal skewer into celebrity @entity238 finalist @entity232 and it would be damn sure to come out dry : see , i can do bitchy with the rest of them so , on behalf of the nation ’s shrinking violets , i hope it will be @entity1 ’s tuesday			0
i hope she beats , too , fellow finalist @entity246 , who is too fiddly and inventive for my taste			0
@entity1 has , after all , been @entity249 three times ( she nearly fell off the stool every time ) , has odds of 2 - 1 , and deserves to win for her poise , her blushes and her modesty as much as her opera cakes and wonky garden shed made from carrots , with a caramel roof that even @entity74 had never come across before			1
@entity1 deserves to win not for always giving it the inevitable 110 per cent , but for winging it , for saying her filo pastry was ‘ a lot better than what i usually knock up ’			0
@entity1 is the poster girl for the shy , the losers in life			0
let ’s hope winning does n’t go to her lovely head .			0

@entity3 hails @entity271 as the ' mistress of the art of self depreciation '
says criticism of 21 - year - old former model ' beggars belief '
@entity87 student has been ' star baker ' three times as final approaches
