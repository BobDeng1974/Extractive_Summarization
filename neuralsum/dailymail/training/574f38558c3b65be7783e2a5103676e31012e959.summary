by @entity0 serial criminals with more than 100 convictions are routinely escaping with a slap on the wrist , it emerged yesterday			2
extraordinary new figures reveal that in the past year alone , 1,079 of the country ’s most prolific offenders were spared a jail term by courts			2
soft justice is being handed out to criminals guilty of even some of the worst crimes			1
new figures reveal that in the past year alone , 1,079 of the country 's most prolific offenders were spared jail in one shocking case , a burglar being sentenced for his 65th offence was given another chance – despite having a history of crime stretching back 50 years			1
in total , 2,583 burglars with 15 or more previous convictions were let off with a fine or other community punishment last year			0
similarly , 1,970 people found guilty more than 15 times of violence against the person also escaped prison			2
for all offences – including robbery and sex crimes – some 112,700 people with more than ten convictions avoided a jail sentence in 2013			2
incredibly , this included 8,500 offenders who had already been punished on 50 previous occasions			0
the figures caused alarm in @entity44 and risk creating new tensions inside the legal system			1
a senior @entity48 source said : ‘ we have always been clear that prison is the right place for people who deserve to be there , and if that ’s not where they are ending up , we have to make sure we know why not			0
’ justice secretary @entity56 said the figures underline why we have set about toughening the justice system the research provides fresh confirmation of how @entity62 ’s justice system is failing to rehabilitate the criminals responsible for the majority of crime in @entity66 and @entity67			1
justice secretary @entity56 said : ‘ these figures underline why we have set about toughening the justice system , including scrapping repeat cautions and make sure community sentences have a proper element of punishment			1
' by the end of this @entity74 we will have 3,000 more adult male prison places than we inherited in 2010 , even though we have been dealing with severe financial pressures			0
' it is also why we have made tackling reoffending a central part of our strategy for the criminal justice system			1
’ more than half a million crimes each year are committed by those who have broken the law before			0
' but despite successive governments repeatedly tinkering with the justice system , reoffending rates have been largely static for a decade			1
@entity87 , of the @entity89 think - tank , said it was ‘ extremely dangerous ’ to give soft sentences to prolific criminals			1
‘ judges could have prevented a huge number of crimes by giving these hardened criminals longer sentences , ’ he said			1
‘ even after they are released , criminals who go to prison for two years or more reoffend less than those who get community service or a shorter sentence			0
‘ if judges think there is n’t the capacity to lock up more serious , repeat offenders , the answer is to build more prison places , not more soft justice			1
’ @entity109 is said to cost the country up to £ 13billion a year			0
@entity112 figures show that the highest reoffending rates are for prisoners serving less than 12 months			0
at present they receive little or no support on release and 60 per cent quickly break the law again			0
from next year , those offenders will be put under mandatory supervision in the community for 12 months after release			0
prisons minister @entity122 admitted that there was a ‘ persistent hardcore of offenders being recycled ’ round the justice system			2
he said the government was seeking to tackle reoffending by ‘ transforming ’ rehabilitation .			0
