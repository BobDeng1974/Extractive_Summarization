by @entity0 published : 07:45 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:00 est , 6 february 2014 @entity3 has leapt to the defence of @entity5 and insists the wicketkeeper said ' nothing wrong ' in the team meeting which allegedly led to @entity10 's sacking by @entity11			1
broadcaster @entity12 , a friend of @entity10 , accused prior of saying ' @entity13 ' in that players ' meeting - then accused the gloveman of being a ' hypocrite ' and ' stabbing @entity10 in the back '			1
but @entity3 took to @entity19 to say : ' i was in that @entity22 meeting and @ @entity23 said nothing wrong			2
and only ever has the @entity22 best interests at heart			0
video : scroll down to see @entity12 trying to get out of the way of a @entity29 over appealing for calm : @entity31 leapt to the defence of @entity5 critic : @entity10 told @entity34 the issues that the @entity11 players had with his management all - rounder @entity38 echoed @entity3 's sentiments when he posted : ' @entity40 believe how much stick @ @entity23 has got # laughable '			1
but their former team - mate @entity42 says he is ' baffled ' by the decision to jettison @entity10			1
' i 'll be honest about @entity10 - myself and several other @entity11 players were not exactly members of his fan club during the @entity50 scandal of 2012 , ' @entity42 wrote in the @entity51 ' but i changed my opinion of him once he was reintegrated back into the @entity11 team towards the end of that year			1
' he made a huge effort to improve his attitude around the dressing room			0
i saw or heard no issues with him in @entity62 this winter , his approach was exceptional			0
' that 's why i was baffled on tuesday when he was effectively sacked as an @entity11 player			2
' ' baffled ' : @entity42 says he did not see @entity10 do much wrong @entity67 and even prime minister @entity68 ( right with wife @entity69 ) had his say on the debate prime minister @entity68 also waded into the row , insisting there is a ' powerful argument ' for keeping @entity10 in the side			1
speaking on @entity76 , @entity68 said : ' i am an enormous fan of @entity10 and i have had some of my most enjoyable times watching him tonking the ball all over the park			2
' his average is remarkable			0
it is not often i have a sympathy for @entity12 but i thought he was making quite a powerful argument this morning on my radio			1
' but i will let the @entity11 selectors pick the @entity11 team , i think i had better stay out of this one			0
' hitting out : @entity5 has blasted accusations from @entity10 's friend @entity12 tough time : prior struggled in @entity62 and was dropped after the third test the @entity92 have refused to clarify the details of the fallout from the team meeting because of legal complications , including confidentially clauses in the @entity10 settlement			1
but this version of events from inside the dressing room tallies with that of the @entity10 camp , who maintain that their man was the only player prepared to tell @entity34 some home truths			0
it also brings some context to the explosive tweets on wednesday by broadcaster @entity12 , @entity10 ’s flag - waver - in - chief , who claimed prior told his team - mates at the summit that @entity34 was ‘ behaving like a headmaster ’ and that they were playing in a ‘ schoolboy environment ’			1
according to @entity12 , prior added : ‘ @entity13 , this is our team			0
’ happier times : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity118 celebrate @entity120 victory @entity67 in 2010 @entity12 further tweeted , after challenging @entity5 to take legal action if the accusations were incorrect : ‘ you stabbed @entity10 in the back , yet you agreed with him re @entity34 ’s dictator style			1
makes you a flaming hypocrite			0
‘ for the record , @ @entity23 ( prior ) led the @entity11 team meeting after @entity129			0
’ prior responded : ‘ i do n’t do this pr , spinning media rubbish , but i refuse to be attacked by a bloke that knows very little about what goes on in the @entity11 set - up apart from rumour , gossip and hearsay from certain individuals			0
‘ i ’m not the kind of person to divulge what is said in team meetings , but all i will say is that @entity34 , @entity144 and the rest of my team - mates know exactly what i said and the way it was meant			0
’ re-integrated : team - mate @entity5 posted this picture of @entity10 on @entity19 in late 2012 with the caption : ' " re-integration complete			1
' ironically , prior had acted as peacemaker when @entity10 was left out of the @entity11 team in 2012 following a number of issues over his contract			2
but the wicketkeeper continued his attack on @entity12 by saying : ‘ there is no story here , just an attempt to knock someone who has only ever had the team ’s best interests at heart and tried my best on and off the field to help the @entity11 cricket team			2
‘ i can hold my head up high in that knowledge ! ’ taking a battering : @entity12 ( right ) faces @entity29 in the nets at the @entity174			0
