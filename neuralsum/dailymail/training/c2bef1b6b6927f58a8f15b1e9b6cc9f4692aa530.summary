response : @entity90 energy secretary @entity89 said energy companies ' think they can get away with treating their customers poorly ' this added to uncertainty about its investment programme in the five years from 2015 , which @entity8 said was likely to be lower than the £ 1.5billion - £ 1.7billion range invested annually since 2010			1
the group ’s statement also addressed the question of @entity102 independence , saying that while it did not have a view on the matter , it reiterated that the uncertainty over the future ‘ increased legislative and regulatory risk ’			0

@entity8 said a shake - up at the top of the company hierarchy will see its management board replaced by a slimmed - down six - strong executive committee			2
shadow energy secretary @entity89 said : ‘ yet again we see an energy company increasing its profits and payouts to shareholders on the back of spiralling bills for hard - pressed consumers			2
