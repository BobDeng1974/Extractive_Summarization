if you have ever travelled to the @entity2 and @entity3 and forgotten to tip the hotel staff , the chances are you experienced a rather awkward reaction			2
similarly , if you slipped table staff a few extra euros following a meal in @entity9 or @entity10 , then you probably received a similar response			2
do the same in @entity13 and you may even find yourself in trouble with the police â€“ it 's illegal			1
but travel search site @entity23 has now constructed an easy - to - follow infographic revealing where and when to tip when travelling abroad			1
according to the infographic , no tipping should ever happen in @entity13 , @entity10 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity9			1
in @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , tipping is expected after eating in a restaurant , unless service charge is included			2
tipping is left up to the customer in countries including the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			1
but travel search site @entity23 has now constructed an easy - to - follow infographic which aims to take the confusion out of when and where to tip when travelling abroad deciding whether to leave a tip in these countries depends on the quality of service or experience			1
' in the @entity2 , low wage earners in the service industry are reliant on tipping to balance out their income , yet in @entity62 , tips are often declined and in @entity10 , tipping is considered offensive , ' explains @entity65 , chief marketing officer for @entity23			1
' it 's wise to be aware of the tipping customs in each place you visit to avoid uncomfortable situations , ensure a smooth trip and avoid paying too much which is quite often the result			0
' in @entity13 for example , tipping is actually illegal , however , waiters often expect to be tipped by foreigners so if you were to tip , discretion is advised			1
' knowing which countries where you should leave a tip is just as important as knowing which countries not to			0
' it 's amazing how many travellers forget to research this all important component of visiting other countries			0
' there are always considerations and dependencies in any country that you should investigate further before travelling , ' @entity65 continued			0
knowing where and who to tip in different countries can be something of a social minefield ' for instance , in the @entity44 , tipping for food in restaurants is ok , although unexpected as service charges are generally included			1
yet , tipping for drinks at a bar is just not cricket ! ' where restaurants are where you 'd most expect to leave a tip as an acknowledgement of good food and service , some countries expect it for other areas of service too			2
in general , it 's not uncommon to give a small tip to your porter as he drops off your luggage in your hotel room in most places			0
rounding up your fare for taxi drivers is common in most countries , apart from @entity122 and @entity35 , where it 's not expected at all			0
' it seems that tipping traditions are evolving throughout the world as more people travel			1
' @entity127 and @entity122 do n't have a history of tipping , yet travellers who are unaware of this fact have heightened some expectations from service staff , ' @entity65 added			0
' if you have n't done your homework before you go , remember you can always ask what the custom is from hotel staff			0
' most people will appreciate you taking the time to find out , and it 's a good way to avoid some very sticky situations			0
