published : 04:12 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 05:29 est , 13 january 2014 foreign secretary @entity1 is to demand a group of @entity4 countries be able to give @entity5 a red card @entity7 is to demand national governments have the power to give a red card to @entity5 red - tape			1
@entity1 , the foreign secretary , revealed the idea of allowing a bloc of fewer than 10 @entity4 states to veto unwelcome laws will be a key demand of renegotiation talks to claw back powers			1
but he rejected calls from @entity21 mps for the @entity7 to be able to say no unilaterally to anything that the @entity4 demands , warning it would undermine the single market			1
@entity26 was warned last night that he risked causing disastrous divisions in the @entity21 party after a letter from 95 backbenchers demanding the right to say no to @entity33 legislation was branded unrealistic			1
the number of rebels calling for a veto on new @entity4 laws – and the power to repeal existing ones that threaten @entity7 ’s national interests – dwarfs the 81 mps who voted against the government on @entity33 in 2011			1
the letter was signed by almost two thirds of the 158 backbenchers not given jobs by mr @entity26			2
mr @entity1 today said the idea of every @entity4 country being able to go it alone and reject any @entity5 edict would be unworkable ‘ in any system which relies on common rules ’			1
but he revealed @entity21 plans to renegotiate @entity7 ’s @entity4 membership before an in - out referendum would include allowing groups of member states to say no to @entity57			1
under existing @entity4 rules , if a third of the 28 member states object to planned legislation they can raise a ‘ yellow card ’ demanding it be reviewed			1
but mr @entity1 wants to go further and allow a ‘ red card ’ system which would allow fewer than 10 countries to reject @entity4 laws outright			1
‘ we do want a much bigger role for national parliaments , ’ he told @entity69 ’s today programme			2
‘ it ’s common ground not only in the conservative party but in the country that the powers of the @entity4 have increased too much , that they are too great , that they must be diminished			1
‘ it is common ground i think that national parliaments need a bigger role			2
one of the things i have advocated is a red card system where if enough national parliaments across the @entity4 want to block something then they are able to do so			1
’ prime minister @entity26 has been warned that he will foster division in the party if he ignores the views of eurosceptics he said the idea would ‘ absolutely ’ be part of @entity7 demands for a fresh settlement with the @entity4			1
‘ there ’s a yellow card system , not very much used at the moment , but it needs to be much stronger red card system			2
‘ and many other ways can be looked at of strengthening the powers of national parliaments			2
’ but he dismissed the calls from dozens if @entity101 for every national government to be able to refuse to implement @entity4 law			1
mr @entity1 added : ‘ what you ca n’t have in any system which relies on common rules even in a free trade area that relies on common rules is each of the parliaments being able regularly and unilaterally to say we are not applying this or that just by own decision			1
‘ clearly a single market or free trade area would not work on that basis ; even the @entity119 or @entity120 arrangement with the @entity4 could not work on that basis			2
@entity122 , who co-ordinated the letter , said europhiles overestimate the economic damage that could be caused if the @entity7 renegotiates its relationship with the @entity4 ‘ we have to be careful what we support but the direction of greater power for national parliaments and reducing relatively speaking the powers of the @entity4 , vis - à - vis national parliaments is something i very strongly support			1
’ the row is expected to intensify on wednesday when chancellor @entity137 makes a speech arguing that @entity7 should remain within a reformed @entity4			1
the number of rebels calling for a veto on new @entity4 laws – and the power to repeal existing ones that threaten @entity7 ’s national interests – dwarfs the 81 mps who voted against the government on @entity33 in 2011			1
the letter was signed by almost two thirds of the 158 backbenchers not given jobs by mr @entity26			2
the rebels say at least six @entity153 members also back them , plus six ministerial aides and members of mr @entity26 ’s policy board , making the true figure 107 mps or more			2
one signatory said : ‘ if @entity160 digs in over this they are absolutely bonkers			0
they will create a @entity153 split			0
this is a wake - up call			0
if the governing elite of our party are so absolutely out of touch it ’s going to be absolutely disastrous			0
’ at the moment , mr @entity26 can only veto new laws on the most sensitive issues such as defence and the @entity4 budget			2
but while @entity173 can raise concerns with the @entity175 , it has no powers to block or repeal existing laws			0
the rebels call on mr @entity26 to ‘ make the idea of a national veto over current and future @entity4 laws a reality ’ and ‘ enable @entity173 to disapply @entity4 legislation , where it is in our vital national interests to do so ’			1
the mps point out that this ‘ would transform the @entity7 ’s negotiating position in the @entity4 ’ as mr @entity26 seeks to carve out a new relationship with @entity5 ahead of an in - out referendum in 2017			1
@entity122 , who coordinated the letter , said : ‘ we ’re all being very polite to each other but i think it ’s better if we have some honest disagreements on the future of @entity33 rather than pretending we agree			0
‘ it ’s the facile tactics @entity197 always use			0
they start talking about three million jobs as if the sky is going to fall in if we ask for some powers back			0
’ @entity201 , another signatory , said many rebels do n’t even want the single market , adding : ‘ if this makes the single market not work , that ’s not the problem			0
we can still have free trade , which is more important			0
laws should be made by our democratic representatives , not by the fiat of @entity5			2
’ signatories include @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and ex-defence minister sir @entity218			0
one said : ‘ @entity160 ’s argument is such rubbish			0
we are at crunch point			0
they are heading for the most almighty smash - up			0
’ they said mr @entity26 had nothing to lose by making the veto @entity21 policy because the pro-european wing of the @entity21 was so depleted			2
one added : ‘ would the party be split ? i do n’t think so			0
’ @entity33 's ‘ travelling circus ’ , in which @entity233 decamp to @entity234 once a month , costs taxpayers at least £ 93million a year			0
@entity4 figures show the astonishing price of packing up the parliament in @entity5 and shipping it to @entity238 for just four days each month			1
conservative meps estimated the true cost to be £ 130million – and called for an end to the practice			0
some £ 250,000 is spent just lugging paperwork between the two cities , a report on the ‘ financial and environmental impact ’ showed			0
maintaining the parliament in @entity238 costs £ 50million a year			0
although @entity233 voted to scrap the ‘ circus ’ by three to one last year , the @entity234 will veto any such attempt			0
conservative mep @entity250 said : ‘ this craziness has to stop			0
