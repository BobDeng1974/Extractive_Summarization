honeymoon murder - accused @entity0 suffered a ' panic attack ' outside court today when photographers surrounded his car and banged his window with their lenses , according to his lawyer			1
@entity0 nodded his head for emphasis when @entity11 asked judge @entity12 to remind the media of his client 's fragile ' mental health '			1
@entity17 authorities have a limited time in which to convict or acquit the 34 - year - old for his alleged role in the murder of his wife , @entity22 , during their honeymoon four years ago			0
' we want to see justice done and incidents like that mean that justice may not be done , ' the judge scolded the reporters in court , requesting that the media ' treat the accused and the case with the necessary dignity '			2
since the start of his high profile trial , @entity0 has betrayed little sign of the post post traumatic stress disorder and severe depression that prevented his return to @entity17 to face charges over the contract killing of his @entity58 bride			2
his sensitivity to noise was said to be so profound that he was allowed to live in a camper van in the grounds of a mental hospital in @entity64 as he waged a legal battle against extradition			0
once he was extradited , however , @entity0 's mental improved quickly and dramatically , and was deemed fit to stand trial just four months later			1
@entity69 's father , @entity70 , and her cousin @entity72 leave the @entity73 a panel of mental health experts said while the wealthy businessman remains vulnerable to tears , distress , panic attacks and startling from ' sudden ambient noises ' , he is clear of depression			1
amid obvious fears that his mental health could falter , the @entity17 authorities have gone out of their way to minimise any stress for @entity0 , who is being held in a private room at a psychiatric hospital where he is allowed special privileges			1
he is driven to and from court in the back of a hospital car each day			1
the number of reporters given access to the room at the @entity98 high court has been strictly limited and pictures were only allowed to be taken in the first minutes of @entity0 appearing in the dock			2
@entity0 's mother @entity101 ( left ) and father @entity102 ( right ) leave the @entity73 @entity0 's sister @entity103 leaves the @entity73 at the end of the hearing applications to televise @entity0 's hearing in the style of the @entity110 murder trial , which was screened and debated around the clock on a pop - up channel , were turned down flat			1
during the five hours or so he sits in the dock every day , he appears quite relaxed and able to follow proceedings easily , occupying himself with files of legal papers and writing notes to his legal team			0
occasionally , he seems bothered by the banging of a door at the back of the court or coughing from the packed gallery – on one occasion he was seen to mouth ' shut up ' at an elderly member of the public observing from above			0
however , coming face to face with his wife 's killers and the gay escort he had paid for sexual humiliation and physical abuse appeared not to leave him in any obvious emotional discomfort			0
convicted taxi driver @entity136 – who is the state 's main witness against @entity0 – today spent a second day under cross-examination , and was forced to admit to discrepancies in his story			1
@entity0 is accused of hiring hitmen to kill his new bride @entity22 on their honeytmoon in @entity17 mr @entity11 highlighted a number of stark contradictions between @entity136 's evidence to @entity0 's trial this week , his statement to police four years ago - a week after mrs @entity69 's murder and subsequent plea and sentencing agreement			1
@entity136 – who claims he was recruited by @entity69 to stage a carjacking as the cover for his wife 's murder - was given a reduced sentence for his part in the killing in exchange of giving evidence against @entity0			2
asked by @entity161 whether he realised how important his plea and sentencing agreement was at the time he signed it , and which now varies with his recollections in the witness box , @entity136 replied , ' my lady , at that time my condition was weak			0
as time went on , i remembered			0
' two hitmen recruited to kill mrs @entity69 by a middleman called @entity173 , were both jailed for their roles			0
@entity175 was given immunity from prosecution for his co-operation with police			0
it was revealed today that he gave a fresh statement to police only last month , but it is not yet known whether this will help @entity0 's case or not			2
@entity0 denies five counts , including kidnap and murder			0
