by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:35 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 11:55 est , 13 september 2013 her baby is not yet two months old			0
but last night as the @entity4 made her first appearance on the red carpet since she gave birth , she showed the world she was ready to cast off her dressing gown and step back into the spotlight			2
she is , after all , the new jewel in the royal family 's crown , partly behind their sharp rise in global popularity			0
and certainly worth a designer frock or two			0
the frock of last night - a gold , floor - length sequin gown from @entity22 's current collection worth around £ 2,500 - was certainly a showstopper			1
dazzling @entity4 : @entity4 arriving at the inaugural @entity24 at the @entity25 in @entity26 her shoes - the £ 484 vamp style from @entity28 - were about as far from the standard issue ballet pump favoured by the yummy mummy @entity31 set as they come			1
she accessorised with diamond drop earrings and a diamond bracelet , which was reportedly a wedding gift from prince @entity37			0
the message she was sending out was clear : i am a glamorous woman who can do it all : be a mother , a fashion icon , a charitable ambassador , and a wife			0
oh yes - and i can be slim , polished , beautiful and cheerful while i 'm doing it			0
as far as we know , @entity4 may well have been furiously pumping milk for @entity50 moments before she stepped out the door			1
she might have been in agony from overfull breasts as @entity50 's feeding times slipped by			2
and she may have suffered the very real fear that one of her breast pads might slip loose on the red carpet			0
perfect in @entity59 : @entity4 's sleeveless gown flattered her already - slender post-baby body			1
the high neck and draped back added another layer of dimension and dram all of these things can be issues for new mothers and , at less than two months in , it 's rare for a mother to feel entirely comfortable about slipping back into her old role			0
but whatever she may have been feeling under that newly tanned , line - free , smiling face of hers - maybe the fear that a mewling baby might wake her every hour during the night when she got home - she let none of it show			0
here we look at the detail that went into @entity4 's debut red carpet look			2
hair while last week some picky observers mentioned her hair was lacklustre , last night her newly tinted chestnut locks looked like something straight out of a @entity91 ad			1
her hair looked to have been tinted and cut ahead of the event , likely by her trusted stylist @entity93			1
@entity93 is the hair stylist who arrived at the hospital with an assistant to give @entity4 perfect glossy locks for her grand departure after giving birth to @entity50 in july			1
@entity100 star : new mother @entity4 chose a dazzling gown by @entity102 designer @entity22 for the event natural beauty : @entity105 wore her hair loose around her shoulders , with understated make - up save for her dramatic smoky eyes @entity93 , 50 , often styles @entity4 's hair at home and has been cutting @entity113 and @entity114 's hair for years - since they were children , in fact			1
@entity93 has been @entity4 's hairdresser since the couple visited the @entity118 on a @entity119 in september last year			2
the stylist was credited with giving @entity4 heat - proof hair that defied the humid @entity123 weather			1
@entity93 ( @entity124 ) is the hair stylist who arrived at the hospital with an assistant to give @entity4 perfect glossy locks for her grand departure after giving birth to @entity50 in july bad hair day : @entity4 had been criticised for her unusually lacklustre locks when she stepped out in @entity132 recently @entity93 and @entity4 are said to have become close , the stylist is known for her discretion and has always kept a low profile			1
her ex-husband @entity136 also has royal connections : his @entity139 salon held the @entity140 from 1980 to 1994 and he worked closely with the @entity142 ’s longest - serving hairdresser , @entity141			0
@entity4 added to her dazzling look with diamond drop earrings and a diamond bracelet			2
the bejewelled bangle is said to have been a wedding gift from prince @entity37			0
@entity105 accessorised her gorgeous dress with a pair of diamond drop earrings and matching bracelet shoes she was once criticised by shoe designer @entity153 for her fondness for a demure @entity156 heel			0
' why ca n't she be more " princessy " , he railed			0
and last night , with her spectacular silver @entity28 heels ( she wo n't be wearing @entity153 any time soon , we 're guessing ) @entity4 proved she could dress to impress as well as any @entity159			1
dressy : @entity105 wore her trusty silver crackled leather shoes by @entity28 , which retail for £ 484 but @entity164 should note that this was not the first time @entity4 has worn designer shoes - in fact , she often steps out at red carpet events in the dazzling £ 484 heels			1
@entity105 wore the sparkly @entity171 for a red carpet appearance in @entity173 last year , when she paired them with a lilac @entity177 gown			2
she slipped them on again in may the same year at @entity180 's hotel in @entity181 for a meeting of the @entity183 , whose members are some of the most powerful men and women in advertising and the media			0
deja - vu ? @entity105 has stepped out in the dazzling shoes many times before , usually at high - profile red carpet events and premieres careful : she was sure to slightly pull up the front of the @entity59 gown to avoid disaster as she took the stairs in the floor length gown and towering heels @entity198 £ 320.52 little mistress @entity199 with @entity201 , £ 80.00 , @entity202 designer light brown embellished drape front maxi dress , £ 120 , @entity205 @entity206 , £ 40 @entity208 sandals , £ 110 , @entity205 miss @entity209 , £ 52 , @entity205 @entity210 , £ 6.50 , @entity211 @entity212 mixed @entity213 , £ 14 , asos @entity215 by @entity216 , £ 75 , notonthehighstreet.com			1
