it 's a plan that even the @entity10 ( @entity11 ) has admitted seems ' counterintuitive ' and has raised ire among wildlife organizations			2
@entity14 , the @entity11 's executive director , says @entity15 has an annual quota to kill five black rhinos and has ' selected ' the club to auction one of them			1
endangered : only about 5,000 black rhinos remain in @entity22 and around 1,795 live in @entity15 , where the @entity11 winner will to shoot one ridicule : the idea of killing an animal in order to save it has drawn widespread scorn ' first and foremost , this is about saving the black rhino , ' said @entity14 , @entity11 executive director			1
“ ' there is a biological reason for this hunt , and it ’s based on a fundamental premise of modern wildlife management : populations matter ; individuals do n’t			0
by removing counterproductive individuals from a herd , rhino populations can actually grow			0
' @entity15 has a black rhino population of 1,795 animals			1
the critically endangered species has been decimated by poachers who hunt it for its valuable horn , and habitat loss			1
since the mid- 1970s , the population has been reduced by about 90 per cent			0
the @entity11 says the auction could generate up to $ 1 million for rhino conservation			2
decimated : black rhinos are hunted for their horn , which is in high demand in @entity54 for traditional medical treatments the idea of hunting an endangered species in order to preserve it has drawn widespread scorn			1
' it 's like the old saying , if you love something , set it free			0
then , when it has a bit of a head start , open fire , ' @entity64 said			0
he suggested facetiously that instead of killing one rhino , all 5,000 remaining black rhinos should be shot , which would raise $ 3.7 billion which could be used to keep one remaining rhino safely confined			2
' i believe this is the only practical way to save the species , ' @entity64 said			0
the black rhino hunt permit will be auctioned in january , but there is already a petition against it			1
' it is bad enough that paid poachers kill for the horn 's imaginary medicinal properties , but what is far worse is that the thoughtless pay for sport hunting resulting in yet one more dead endangered animal just so they can hang the decapitated head on their wall only to puff about it over cocktails , ' writes @entity93 , the originator of the petition			1
@entity95 reports that poachers in @entity22 kill at least one rhino every day			2
' poachers come by helicopter and dart a rhino from the air with a powerful tranquilizer , a drug three thousand times more powerful than morphine			0
' as [ the rhino ] succumbs to deep sedation , they take a chainsaw to her face			0
the machine 's sharp teeth tear into her skull , removing her nasal cavities , exposing parts of her brain			0
[ the horn ] will be sold to a middle man for a small fortune			0
