by @entity0 if clothes could talk , this particular array would exhale a cloud of cigar smoke , adopt an arrogant smirk , and declare : ‘ greed is good ! ’ wearing colourful braces , silk patterned ties , bright socks , expensive loafers , and gelled - back hair , groups of boisterous office workers stride through central @entity15			1
the men chain smoke , or carry brick - sized mobile telephones last seen in the possession of @entity20 , the rapacious financier at the centre of the film @entity23			1
this very public celebration of @entity51 bonus culture took place shortly after 4pm on monday outside the offices of @entity28 , a recruitment and headhunting firm which specialises in the oil and gas sectors			1
the company is among a wave of @entity15 businesses — including banks , law firms , stockbrokers , and hedge funds — organising fancy - dress screenings of @entity68 ’s latest epic movie @entity69			1
roughly 150 employees were asked to show up in ‘ power suits and plenty of hair gel , ’ according to @entity74 , @entity28 ’s development director , who described the dress code as ‘ a bit of fun ’			1
the men chain smoke , or carry brick - sized mobile telephones while the women opt for fur coats , garish scarves , and striped ties colleagues dress in their ' power suits ' ahead of watching @entity30 on @entity23 so boundless is enthusiasm for his story that cinemas in @entity15 have trebled private hire prices they spent the next three hours watching @entity68 ’s biopic of @entity92 , a spectacularly corrupt @entity94 stockbroker whose appetite for sex , drugs , and money saw him dubbed : ‘ the most debauched banker of them all			1
’ ‘ our business is all about sales , and essentially so was @entity92 ’s , ’ said @entity74 beforehand			1
‘ so when we watch this film , we ’ll basically see someone doing what we do every day ; aside from all the illegal stuff , of course			2
‘ the sales techniques he used are the same			2
the way he taught staff to close a deal			0
the timing of when he spoke or kept his mouth shut			0
that ’s why we are fascinated by @entity92 : he was a hell of a salesman			1
’ wearing colourful braces and silk patterned ties workers left their office to watch the film @entity92 was also a prodigious crook			1
nominated for five @entity128 , the film tells how he made tens of millions of dollars from illegal stock sales in the @entity130 , spending most of it on yachts , cocaine , prostitutes , sports cars , and wild parties			0
given these famous excesses — of which more later — not to mention the fact that @entity92 was eventually imprisoned for fraud and money laundering , most viewers regard @entity69 as a cautionary tale			1
yet , in shameless disregard of post credit - crunch public opinion , a very different attitude appears to prevail in the @entity148			1
here , as these pictures suggest , the spectacularly immoral @entity92 , played in the film by @entity151 , is well on his way to becoming a folk hero			1
so boundless is enthusiasm for his story that cinemas in @entity15 have trebled private hire prices for screenings of the film			0
‘ we ’ve never previously seen anything like the level of interest that we ’ve seen in this film , ’ says @entity160 , ceo of @entity161 , one of @entity15 ’s leading venue hire firms			1
‘ there has been a flurry of bookings			2
the usual price for a movie screening is in the region of £ 1,500			0
for this film , the going rate has risen to £ 4,500			0
it ’s straightforward supply and demand			2
’ ‘ it ’s all a bit crazy , ’ added an events manager at one @entity51 insurance broker			1
‘ the prices have sky - rocketed			2
i had to call a huge number of big cinemas before finding somewhere free			0
’ highlighting the level of yuppie interest in @entity69 was a viral email doing the rounds of @entity51 firms last week			2
it noted that the release of @entity23 ( 1987 ) and its sequel @entity194 ( 2010 ) coincided with major falls in stock indices			0
this week , by contrast , the @entity199 has been on the verge of hitting an all - time - high			2
no doubt there were , therefore , happy faces in cinemas at @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 , as well as @entity15 ’s @entity208 , where finance houses held screenings of @entity69 over the weekend			0
it seems there were also wide smiles in @entity214 , where the @entity216 bank @entity215 booked out a 140 - seat cinema , according to a report carried by @entity219			0
most city firms celebrating @entity69 in @entity15 have been keeping a low profile , doubtless hoping to avoid negative @entity222 much like at @entity224 staff are encouraged to work hard and play hard the women opt for fur coats , garish scarves , and striped ties chosen in apparent homage to @entity41 however , those known to have held events include @entity232 , which invited clients to the upmarket @entity235 in @entity236 , and @entity237 , a @entity94 business consultancy which has hired out the @entity239 in @entity240 for 180 guests and 40 staff			1
‘ it ’s a film about our industry , so of course everyone wants to see it , ’ says one guest of @entity244			2
‘ i ’d estimate that 90 to 95 per cent of my colleagues have already been			0
it ’s a hot ticket			0
‘ despite everything that ’s happened to the finance industry over the past five or six years , the @entity51 ’s still a pretty brash place , and there ’s huge nostalgia for the days of red braces and slicked - back hair			1
’ many guests at private screenings of @entity69 might have reflected on the ways that their working life imitates art. lavish : @entity151 in @entity68 's @entity30 of @entity23 the film centres on the raucous offices of @entity92 ’s firm @entity224 , where male staff outnumbered females by roughly ten to one , and where debauchery was n’t so much encouraged as mandatory			1
@entity68 shows , among other things , how @entity92 spent tens of thousands of dollars each month hiring prostitutes for his 1,000 staff , who used cocaine , crack , marijuana , morphine , and the sleeping pill @entity276 on an almost daily basis			1
office pets included a nappy - wearing chimpanzee , a @entity281 trained to say “ f * * * off ! ” and a goldfish which ended up being eaten by an executive			0
at the end of trading days , employees would hold dwarf - tossing contents			2
@entity68 shows how @entity92 spent tens of thousands of dollars each month hiring prostitutes for his 1,000 staff most city firms celebrating @entity69 in @entity15 have been keeping a low profile at @entity28 , illegal behaviour is of course never tolerated			1
however — much like at @entity224 — staff are encouraged to work hard and play hard , in a devotedly eccentric environment			0
instead of a carpet , the firm ’s main office is covered by astro - turf			2
punch bags hang from the ceiling to help relieve stress , and employees who close deals are encouraged to take celebratory bike rides around the floor			0
outrageous : office pets included a nappy - wearing chimpanzee and a @entity281 trained to say ' f * * * off ! ' staff who hit sales targets for three straight months are meanwhile allowed to spend a week working from an office the firm keeps in @entity313 ( ‘ and no , we do n’t expect them to do very much work , ’ says @entity74 )			2
‘ we are a professional environment			0
we ’d frown on people coming in on friday morning with cocaine all over their face			0
they ’d be sacked , ’ he adds			0
‘ so you ca n’t say that @entity92 is a hero to us			1
but he is , perhaps , an anti-hero			0

the advanced free screening of @entity68 ’s movie was held at the @entity336 theatre , a four minute walk from @entity322 ’ headquarters at 200 west street in @entity323			1
the building is so close in fact that you can see @entity322 ’s trading room floor from the cinema ’s escalator			0
@entity345 of the @entity346 , described the experience of watching the film amongst a finance - heavy audience as ‘ disturbing ’ , who cheered every cocaine - addled move of @entity151 ’s character @entity92			1
‘ there ’s a lot of talk about how @entity23 has “ changed ” since the financial crisis , ’ he wrote			2
‘ but you would n’t necessarily know that from what these guys were cheering at			0
‘ when @entity92 – a drug addict who later attempts to remain sober – rips up a couch cushion to get to his secret coke stash , there were cheers			1
’ he added that the worst part of watching the film was when @entity92 is enlisted by the authorities to implicate others at his firm but attempts to save his deputy by writing on a piece of paper that he is wearing a wire			1
‘ and the crowd goes wild			0
do n’t rat ! stand by your firm ! ’			0
