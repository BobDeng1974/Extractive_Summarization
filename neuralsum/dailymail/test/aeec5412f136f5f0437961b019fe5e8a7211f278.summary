not only does @entity0 definitely want to stay at @entity1 beyond the end of this season but he is determined to win over some of the hardest to please supporters in football and become the best player in the world			1
@entity8 can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world 's most expensive player			0
and it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to @entity17 become			0
@entity0 is injured and out of wednesday 's @entity19 showdown with @entity20			0
@entity21 has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the @entity23 is to @entity1			0
@entity0 is adamant that he wants to stay at @entity1 despite strong interest from @entity17 @entity0 has scored 17 goals for @entity1 this season but has still bee criticised by supporters @entity0 holds off the challenge of @entity20 forward @entity30 during @entity32 quarter - final he said last week : ' he had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time			1
he did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season 's run - in too			0
' @entity1 's £ 86million player is hoping to be back in time for the @entity32 semi-finals should the holders qualify			2
his future continues to be the source of much speculation with @entity17 desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the @entity50 next season			2
@entity1 have also privately declared their interest in making @entity53 the long - term successor to @entity54 , just as he is expected to be in the @entity56 side			1
@entity0 is out of @entity1 's @entity32 quarter - final second leg against @entity20 on wednesday the @entity58 international injured his calf during saturday 's 3 - 1 win against @entity62 after just two minutes the possibility of a @entity0 - plus - cash move for @entity65 this summer would certainly suit @entity17 and please those @entity1 supporters who fail to see the value of @entity0 and those goals that won the club three trophies last year , but the player remains adamant that his future is in @entity1			1
in nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in @entity1			1
he had a sensational first season in @entity56 winning four trophies and scoring in the @entity84 , @entity32 and @entity85 finals			2
this season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time			2
@entity0 enjoyed a standout first season in @entity1 and won the @entity32 and the @entity84 the former @entity97 star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the @entity32 final last season he wants to emulate @entity102 , who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses , and to eventually follow in his @entity106 footsteps			1
at the moment @entity102 and @entity107 are a considerable cut above everything else in football but @entity0 sees himself up against @entity112 's @entity111 as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football 's greatest			2
in the @entity118 capital , while no one expects him to leave this summer , nobody sees @entity0 's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent @entity65 from arriving at the @entity121 at the end of the season to become his team - mate			1
@entity21 said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than @entity54 then the @entity56 international would lose his place and @entity65 is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend			1
@entity1 would like to sign @entity17 goalkeeper to be long - term successor to @entity54 @entity65 punches clear under a challenge from @entity137 during saturday 's defeat by @entity139 @entity65 's girlfriend continues to live in @entity1 and her recent unflattering comments about @entity142 did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to @entity56			1
he appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year @entity147 made sure he installed @entity148 - a keeper he knows from his @entity112 days - as @entity65 's @entity149			0
@entity148 was given his debut by the @entity151 and stories coming out of @entity153 suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping , @entity154 does not see @entity65 as in anyway irreplaceable			0
@entity65 spent one season in the @entity20 first team before joining @entity17 in 2011 for £ 18million all that points to the possibility of a return to @entity1 where he previously represented @entity20 but left after only one season in the first team			1
despite his @entity20 past he has none of the emotional pull that @entity165 once had leading him to declare he would never play for @entity1			0
the supporters would welcome him			0
currently if they had to choose between @entity65 and @entity0 they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending @entity0 back to @entity170			2
but they do n't believe it will be necessary			0
they see both men lining - up for them next season			0
@entity0 's desire to stay in @entity56 will keep him at @entity1			1
it only remains to be seen just how much @entity65 wants to join him in the @entity118 capital .			0

@entity0 has been linked with a summer move to @entity17
the @entity58 forward has been criticised by @entity1 fans this season
@entity17 want @entity0 but he has no desire to cut short his time in @entity56
a swap deal involving @entity17 keeper @entity53 has been mooted
@entity1 are interested in bringing @entity65 to @entity56 to replace @entity54
