@entity0 reportedly told the @entity1 that after the problems reinvesting the money received for @entity5 , future transfer policy would entail the purchase of young players , priced between £ 10 - 15million with good potential for resale			1
this may be financially sensible , but it is hardly reassuring			0
elite clubs , those who challenge for the biggest trophies , do not buy with one eye on selling and this strategy would set @entity1 back a decade to a time when they helped solve problems at @entity21 by trading top performers such as @entity23 and @entity24			2
indeed , the only time @entity1 demonstrated real @entity27 potential was when @entity0 resisted the likes of @entity29 over @entity30			1
@entity1 chairman @entity0 is planning a new transfer policy for the club that centres on resale value spurs sold forward @entity5 ( left ) to @entity36 in 2013 for a world - record £ 85 million transfer fee @entity34 ' best chance of securing regular @entity27 football came when @entity30 played for them @entity34 allowed star performers @entity24 ( left ) and @entity23 ( right ) to join @entity21 the moment they started to sell again , @entity1 fell away			1
not even having the @entity44 's top goalscorer in @entity45 has placed them among the elite again — and it is hard to see how that will change if this is the plan			0
nobody overtakes @entity21 by offering a helping hand — no matter how favourable the price			0
even the exploits of @entity44 top goalscorer @entity45 has n't been enough to get @entity34 top - four			0

@entity1 chairman @entity0 has told supporters that future transfer policy will *include* developing young players with resale value
having failed to *successfully* reinvest the money received for @entity5 , @entity0 will now turn to more *modestly* priced players
although financially sensible , @entity0 's new plans could risk @entity34 falling behind the other top clubs in pursuit of the @entity27
