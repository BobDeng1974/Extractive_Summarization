many of us know not to click random links that are sent in emails or on @entity4 , but now we ’re being warned to be on our guard against dangerous files , too			0
@entity7 has discovered a vulnerability in its office software that affects every version of @entity11 , except @entity12			1
and hackers are already exploiting the flaw to trick people into opening infected files and taking over their entire computer			2
it affects every supported version of @entity11 , including @entity21 , 7 , and @entity22 on tablets , but not @entity12			1
if a user opens an infected @entity27 file , a hacker could gain access to their computer			1
@entity7 is currently working on an update in an official advisory notice , @entity7 said it is ‘ aware of a vulnerability affecting all supported releases of @entity11			1
‘ the vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted @entity27 file that contains an @entity39 object			1
’ @entity39 ( @entity39 ) is a technology that allows applications to share data and functionality			0
an attacker who successfully takes advantage of this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user on any targeted computer			0
it affects all supported versions of @entity11 , which includes @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity11 7 , @entity11 8 , @entity53 , and @entity22 what is the vulnerability ? in an official advisory notice , @entity7 said it is ‘ aware of a vulnerability affecting all supported releases of @entity11			1
‘ the vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted @entity27 file that contains an @entity39 object			1
’ which versions of @entity11 are affected ? it affects all supported versions of @entity11 , which includes @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity11 7 , @entity11 8 , @entity53 , and @entity22 @entity64 is no longer supported - which means that when @entity7 issues updates , users running this operating system do n't receive them - however , that does n't mean it is guaranteed to be safe from attack			2
what is @entity39 ? @entity39 ( @entity39 ) is a technology that allows applications to share data and functionality			0
for example , a compound @entity76 document may contain an embedded @entity79 spreadsheet , known as an ole object			0
this technology also enables in - place editing , so instead of launching a new application when an ole object is activated , the user instead can edit it inside their their existing application			0
which files are at risk ? the current @entity27 flaw is already being exploited in a number of ‘ limited , targeted attacks ’ in which infected @entity94 files are being sent over email			1
however , in theory , any @entity27 file is at risk , including @entity76 documents and @entity79 spreadsheets			2
what might an attacker use the vulnerability to do ? an attacker who successfully takes advantage of this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user			0
if the current user is logged on with administrative user rights , an attacker could take complete control of an affected system			0
an attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights			0
how can i protect myself ? @entity7 has issued a temporary fix that users can install to protect themselves ahead of a wider security update			1
it is also advising people not to open unidentified files			0
@entity64 is no longer supported - which means that when @entity7 issues updates , users running this operating system do n't receive them - however , that does n't mean it is safe from attack			2
the current @entity27 flaw is already being exploited in a number of ‘ limited , targeted attacks ’ in which infected @entity94 files are being sent over email			1
however , in theory , any @entity27 file is at risk , including @entity76 documents and @entity79 spreadsheets			2
@entity7 has issued a temporary fix that users can install to protect themselves ahead of a wider security update			1
an attacker who successfully takes advantage of this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user			0
the flaw is already being exploited in a number of ‘ limited , targeted attacks ’ in which infected @entity94 files ( logo pictured ) are being sent over email			1
however , in theory , any @entity27 file is at risk it is also advising people not to open unidentified files			2
the attack can also only be launched if a user consents to opening the file , and users are advised to enable @entity162 ( @entity162 ) , where possible , to be prompted before opening links and files			2
@entity165 from security firm @entity166 said : ‘ currently , @entity7 has not indicated whether a patch to solve this issue will be sent outside of the regular @entity170 cycle			0
until more definitive information becomes available , we advise users to be careful about opening @entity27 documents that they have been sent , particularly if they come from parties that have not sent you documents beforehand			0

@entity7 announced the flaw in a recent security advisory note
it affects every supported version of @entity11 , except @entity12
if a user opens an infected @entity27 file , a hacker can gain access to their *pc*
hackers have already started exploiting the flaw with @entity94 files
a temporary fix has been issued ahead of an official security update
