shameless water firms have been chasing customers in debt by using threatening letters from ‘ invented ’ third - party companies			1
the letters appear to be from an external debt agency , but are actually from the water companies themselves			2
the strategy is part of the psychological warfare used to turn the screw on customers with money troubles , by making them believe their debt has been passed to an outside company			2
worry : some of @entity18 's biggest water firms have been sending third - party letters from themselves ( file photo ) but the tactic has been condemned by consumer groups and mps as underhand and potentially illegal			1
however , some of the water companies involved insist they are doing nothing wrong			0
earlier this year , payday loan giant @entity27 was ordered to pay compensation of £ 2.6million to 45,000 customers who were harassed with threatening letters from firms that it invented to chase debts			2
subsequently , the head of the @entity36 apologised after it emerged the government agency had been using similar tactics			0
recently , the chairman of the @entity41 , @entity42 , condemned high street banks for using the ploy to turn the screw on customers			2
and energy regulator @entity47 has warned power companies that their use of third - party names for their own debt collection or legal departments was unacceptable			0
research by @entity55 ’s @entity53 found that 12 of the largest water firms had used the third - party - letter ploy at some point			1
demanding : @entity59 sent letters from ' @entity61 ' - which is part of the same company five were still doing so earlier this year although this has now been reduced to two			2
typically , the name of the debt collection company appears in large print at the top the letters sent to customers			1
often the small print reveals it is linked to the water company , but sometimes no link is made			1
@entity59 sends out letters headed @entity61 , which is actually part of the company ’s debt collection department			1
in the past , this connection was not spelt out , however the small print now states @entity61 is part of @entity80			1
a spokesman said the use of a third - party name works and it plans to continue with the policy			0
he added : ‘ we try hard to engage with our customers in arrears			0
‘ this is a long process , but our open and transparent letters do increase in severity			0
‘ when it gets to a final letter , we have found the use of an internally branded debt collection agency approach to be effective and cost efficient			0
’ @entity97 has been sending letters to some customers in arrears under the name @entity102 it has changed them recently to include a statement in the small print that it is linked to @entity97			1
it defended the practice , saying : ‘ any customer who receives a letter from @entity107 would already have received three letters from @entity97 urging them to get in touch , as well as a text			1
’ other water firms including @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 stopped sending such letters this year			2
citizens advice condemned the aggressive approach			1
chief executive @entity118 said : ‘ we ’re not saying do n’t pursue debt			0
clearly companies are entitled to do that , but we are saying that they really ought to do that honestly and with some sensitivity			0
‘ these letters are about increasing the level of aggression to get payment			0
‘ they ’re made on the assumption that people wo n’t pay rather than actually that many ca n’t			0

research finds 12 of largest firms sent letters from supposed third parties
but small print reveals ' debt collectors ' are actually part of the same firm
@entity145 and @entity97 both use ploy and others have since stopped
@entity149 condemned the firms ' ' aggressive ' approach
