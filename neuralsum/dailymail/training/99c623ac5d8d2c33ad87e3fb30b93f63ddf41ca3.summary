@entity1 's lawyer told the court that prosecutors have failed to stand up a case against her after seven months of evidence @entity1 has faced ‘ downright cruelty and vitriol ’ during a sustained campaign to convict her of phone hacking ‘ no matter what ’ , the @entity6 heard yesterday			1
the prosecution has failed to find a ‘ smoking gun ’ that proves her guilt , despite a massive police investigation with ‘ untold resources dedicated to it ’ , her lawyer said			1
@entity20 , for @entity21 , said the prosecution had relied on ‘ outrageous ’ tactics in its desperate pursuit of a conviction , including presenting lies and misleading evidence to the jury			1
in his closing speech to the jury , the lawyer launched a broadside against the publicity surrounding the former news international chief executive ’s prosecution			1
he said : ‘ the case has been conducted against the backdrop of significant attention from the media , and attention from the media in all its modern forms			1
‘ opinions have been expressed with views running from criticism and comment through inaccuracy and bias to downright cruelty and vitriol			1
’ during seven months of evidence , mr @entity49 said prosecutors had failed to prove their case against the 45 - year - old , despite ‘ twisting and turning ’ the evidence			1
at least one witness had lied in their evidence , he said , and police had misled jurors ‘ to protect what is the ultimate prosecution theory in this case : @entity1 must be guilty , no matter what ’			1
mr @entity49 said the so - called ‘ @entity65 ’ had failed to show @entity21 was the architect of the phone hacking scandal when she edited the @entity64 , from 2000 to 2003			2
only one story had been proven to come from hacking during her editorship , about murdered schoolgirl @entity69 , and that was published while she was on holiday and her deputy @entity74 was in charge			0
@entity21 had campaigned over the protection of children after the murder of eight - year - old @entity79 and would have been horrified by the hacking of the missing girl , mr @entity49 said			0
the prosecution alleged @entity74 , who later became @entity84 ’s director of communications in @entity85 , was more likely to have told @entity21 about the hack because the pair were involved in a six - year affair			2
@entity21 , who arrived at the @entity6 today with friends and family including @entity21 ( right ) , has been the subject of significant media attention , @entity20 told the court in his closing speech today but mr @entity49 said a 2004 love letter in which @entity21 spoke of waiting for @entity74 for six years did not prove their clandestine relationship lasted for that time , and said there was no telephone contact between them during @entity21 ’ holiday until after the @entity103 messages were hacked			1
he accused the prosecution of being ‘ desperate ’ to link the notorious hacking episode to @entity21 and said once she moved to the @entity107 she and @entity74 were rival editors , adding : ‘ lovers they may have been , but no love was lost between their papers			2
’ the @entity64 ’s £ 92,000 - a - year private detective @entity114 was given 550 ‘ taskings ’ during her editorship but was only proved to have been asked to hack 12 times			0
four news desk editors have admitted their part in a phone hacking conspiracy with @entity114 and mr @entity49 said the prosecution case was that @entity21 must have known and sanctioned the plot			1
but the hacking only became ‘ prolific ’ after she left and @entity114 ’s contract with the newspaper only stipulated ‘ research and information ’ services , mr @entity49 said			0
she left the @entity64 in 2003 to become editor of @entity107 and her lawyer questioned why there had been no evidence of hacking at @entity107 if it was a practice its new editor knew of and approved			2
the former @entity64 editor ( left ) has been standing trial alongside @entity74 ( right ) mr @entity49 said prosecutor @entity139 had pursued an attitude of ‘ theory first , evidence later ’ to convict @entity21 at any cost said the jury might have expected to hear more direct evidence , rather than theories			0
he said : ‘ you must have been expecting him to have laid out for you a whole mass of evidence , a welter of material the police had discovered as a result of a massive inquiry with untold resources directed to it			0
‘ you must have been expecting a mass of material to demonstrate that mrs @entity1 was the architect of phone hacking at the @entity64			2
that was not the case			0
’ opinions have been expressed with views running from criticism and comment through inaccuracy and bias to downright cruelty and vitriol - @entity20 mr @entity49 said the prosecution had called a witness , @entity171 , the ex-wife of golfer @entity172 , who had been caught out lying in her evidence			1
the jury has heard she claimed @entity21 told her about an episode when she was arrested for an alleged assault on her ex-husband , @entity179 actor @entity178 , when the arrest actually happened months after mrs @entity171 met @entity21			0
the trial has now entered its final phase , with lawyers for each of the seven defendants giving speeches on their behalf and the jury is expected to be sent out to consider verdicts next month ( june )			0
@entity21 and @entity74 , 46 , both deny conspiring to hack phones and conspiring with others to commit misconduct by making illegal payments to public officials			0
@entity21 also denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice			0
all seven defendants deny all the charges against them			0

attacked ' media attention ' surrounding the case and ' opinions expressed '
