there 's a common perception among @entity2 that the seafood served up to consumers is local produce			1
but the reality is that @entity2 imports more than 70 per cent of its seafood			1
in a shocking revelation , former chef and food critic @entity8 has revealed that the flathead , barramundi , @entity14 dory and prawns sold to @entity2 are sourced from @entity16 or @entity17			1
this is all to meet the growing appetite for seafood and the demand for cheaper produce			0
not only is this taking a toll on the @entity2 seafood industry but it is also putting the consumers ' health at risk , according to mr @entity8			1
he says lax labelling of seafood allows businesses to sell their produce while consumers are completely unaware that they are condoning poor practices in some fisheries , placing particular species under threat , destroying habitats and accepting working conditions that violate human rights			2
' when we eat near the coast or in @entity2 , we tend to presume that it comes from nearby when the reality is that it often is n't , ' he told @entity56			2
' but roughly 72 per cent of seafood that we eat is imported			2
' we 're a net importer of seafood and have been for a long time and that will probably increase			0
we are eating more seafood than we did say 20 to 30 years ago			2
' i do n't have a problem with imported seafood if it 's produced sustainably			2
' this is the motivation behind his campaign to push for clearer seafood labelling , as mr @entity8 uncovers the truth behind some of @entity2 's favourite dishes in @entity75 three - part documentary ' what 's the catch ? '			1
however the most distressing discovery for mr @entity8 was that most of the fish or flake at local fish and chips shops are from @entity16			1
' a lot of what we eat is flake and that means we could be eating any one of 400 species of shark , ' he said			0
' but then i met a guy who represents the fisherman from southeast of @entity2			2
they catch heaps of flat head in his local area but 9 out of 10 fish and chips shops do n't sell the true flat head and sell the @entity16 import			2
' so you 'll be in a town next to fishing boats eating fish and chips that has come from @entity16 rather than the flat head that comes from the boats you can see at the end of the jetty			2
' lax regulations on seafood labelling in @entity2 allows businesses to sell their produce without telling consumers what 's really underneath the batter oceans campaigner of @entity118 , @entity119 , supports this claim			1
' the @entity2 fish we all know and think we 're eating is in fact a completely unrelated species called stick fish , ' he told @entity56			0
' it 's a fish from @entity16 that 's from a different family but is sold to us as flat head			2
' mr @entity119 adds this is a similar case for basa , a native to @entity134 's @entity133 , which is often deceptively labelled as ' pacific dory '			1
' @entity136 is a cat fish and is n't part of the dory family , ' he said			0
' but it 's commonly marketed as @entity14 dory because businesses are n't obliged to abide by the fish name standards			0
' a @entity118 report shows this has a greater health issue as for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers who are recommended to limit their intake of catfish , sharks and orange roughy due to its high content of mercury			1
' without correct labelling we wo n't know what we 're eating , ' mr @entity119 said			0
further research in the report reveals 68 per cent of barramundi sold in @entity2 is imported from @entity17 countries such as @entity161 and @entity162			1
a fisherman casts his net from a boat in the @entity133 , @entity134 fisherman catch catfish in @entity134 which is then exported and sold in @entity2 as for the prawns sold in @entity2 eateries , such as our sushi or pizzas , it is most likely they are from @entity46			1
' sadly the poorly managed countries through @entity17 do n't have the resources to police and manage their fisheries properly , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' our fisheries and fish farms are at a disadvantage because they have to meet much more stringent regulations			0
' antibiotics in prawn farms are used overseas but ca n't be used in @entity2 prawn farms because they are considered dangerous within the @entity2 market			0
but then we can buy prawns from a system which allows that			0
' part of the problem from my perspective is that massive amounts of seafood has been ripped out of our system , just so we can have cheap prawns in our pizzas and sushi			0
' even local fish and chips stores are sourcing cheaper imported produce trying to keep up with the demands			0
' a local told me that they have to pay $ 3 more to put @entity2 flat head rather than @entity16 flat head on their menu for a serve of fish and chips , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' and i know that @entity16 fisheries are not well regulated			0
' mr @entity8 says @entity2 imports more than 70 % of its seafood and this will only continue to increase mr @entity8 says @entity17 countries do n't have the resources to police and manage their fisheries properly mr @entity8 is backed by @entity118 and the @entity219 , who also launched the @entity222 campaign on thursday			1
they are calling for @entity2 to follow the @entity225 's example of proper seafood labelling			1
this means @entity2 will know what species they 're eating , where it was caught and how it was produced			0
mr @entity8 believes this will help consumers make a sustainable choice before they buy their seafood			1
his prime concern is that @entity2 are n't aware of where their produce is coming from , which prompted him to initiate a senate inquiry into seafood labelling			1
mr @entity8 says lack of seafood labelling on sushi prevents @entity2 from making sustainable choices about seafood ' the only way we can make a conscious decision to choose sustainable seafood , is by knowing for a start , what we 're eating , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' i want people to know what they 're eating so that they think about their seafood and they do n't see the ocean as this bottomless pit that will provide seafood forever			0
' our choices can make a difference and all we need to do is ask what 's on our plate			2
' some people wo n't care			0
they will always buy the lowest price			0
but until we have that information , we have no power to make that choice			0
' and if we do n't act now , mr @entity8 says this will continue to damage our marine environment			1
' it will impact us like the fisheries all over that world that are at capacity or over-fished , ' he said			0
' the oceans need our help			0
they 've reached their limit			0
' ' so until we know what we 're eating , we ca n't make that conscious decision because we do n't know what actually is on our plate with the way the system currently stands			0
' what 's the catch ? premiers on october 30 at 8.30pm on @entity75			1
@entity136 : a native catfish of @entity134 's @entity133 , is imported to @entity2 and often sold as ' @entity284 '			1
@entity285 : a @entity118 report reveals that 68 per cent of the fish is imported from @entity161 and @entity162			1
@entity288 : @entity2 flatheads are n't often sold at local fish stores , where it was discovered that most are sourced from @entity16			2
however the so - called ' @entity16 flathead ' is in fact a different species called ' stick fish '			2
@entity295 : in order to meet the demands for cheap prawns , most are imported from @entity46 's prawn farms which use antibiotics .			0
