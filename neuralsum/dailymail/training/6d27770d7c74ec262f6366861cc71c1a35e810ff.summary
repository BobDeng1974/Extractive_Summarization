was it at 2.01pm on saturday that @entity2 ’s extraordinary miscalculation brought an end to his dreams of a second world title and his wider hopes of becoming an all - time great of his sport ? it may yet unfold that this conjurer of the track , the phenomenal @entity11 , will drive as brilliantly in the @entity13 @entity12 on sunday as he acted foolishly in qualifying here and restore himself in his title fight with @entity18 team - mate @entity17			1
nothing can ever be ruled out with @entity2 , this see - sawing driver , but on saturday night the feeling was that a dramatic , defining , damning moment had left its imprint on the 2014 season			1
@entity17 passed him , set the fastest lap and will start the race from pole			1
@entity2 , who trails @entity17 by 29 points , will start from sixth			1
why ? ‘ i do n’t know , ’ said @entity2 , at his surly worst when asked for an explanation in front of the @entity41 cameras			1
‘ i do n’t have much of an answer			0
i just decided not to do the lap. ’ with that he walked off almost as ill - advisedly as he had turned off the track a few minutes @entity45 was his respect for ‘ the greatest fans in the world ’ , the @entity13 public he had buttered up a few days earlier with what now sounded like empty platitudes ? too slow : @entity17 passed @entity2 to set the fastest lap and will start sunday 's race from pole but back to qualifying , which was beset by changing conditions : drizzle , rain , cloudy but dry , sunny			1
@entity2 had set the fastest time in his first lap of the final session before rain fell harder and all the cars came in			1
@entity63 would the rain relent , allowing them to go out again ? @entity65 , the @entity18 chairman , said : ‘ the team wanted them to stay in , but the drivers said they wanted to get in another lap , so it was decided they would			0
’ in that final , supposed shootout , @entity2 made a small mistake , locking up , at the @entity72 - and , believing it to be too wet to beat his previous time , pulled out of the lap and let @entity17 through to capitalise on the markedly drier conditions at the end of track			1
@entity18 put out a statement a few minutes later to explain @entity2 ’s side of the story			1
‘ i made a mistake today and pulled out of the lap when i should have kept going , ’ he said			0
mistake : @entity2 's miscalculation could end his dreams of a second world title ‘ it was a tough qualifying with the changing conditions and we got through most of it really well , until the most important part			1
‘ it was my decision , a bad call , and that decided my qualifying			2
‘ i ’m so sorry to have disappointed the fans here today as their support has been fantastic and i ’ll do what i can to have a great race for them on sunday			2
i need to have a start like i had in @entity102 two weeks ago and then do my best to get back to the front			0
you never know what might happen			0
‘ it ’s difficult when you 're just out of the car to express your emotions and see the positive , but i ’ll go back to the team and my family now and we 'll build up for tomorrow from there			0
’ pole : @entity17 ( centre ) @entity115 , and @entity116 ( left ) will start from the front at @entity26 well , that was like the @entity119 compared to the muddle of excuses – amid some perfectly reasonable excuses – put forward by @entity2 when he came to his press conference later			1
his funniest claim was that , ‘ i never give up ’			0
so , what were you doing abandoning the lap , @entity11 ? he again accepted that it was his fault , yet , contradicting that , cited the failure of the team to tell him it was faster in the final part of the lap as some sort of mitigation for his decision			0
what makes saturday ’s antics most bizarre is that @entity2 , for all his ups and downs , has always been a racer , a fight - to - the - end warrior			2
but here at @entity26 , of all places , where conditions are famously different from one end of the track to another , did he decide to stop			0
lead : @entity2 ( right ) rounds a corner ahead @entity17 during qualification on saturday he could have qualified second or third or fourth or fifth			1
in fact , he could have beaten @entity17			2
there is a pattern emerging : he has made mistakes in the past most recent qualifying sessions , a part of his performance that is traditionally extremely strong			0
@entity17 , it seems , has rattled him			2
sir @entity157 , watching from the paddock , said : ‘ his head certainly seems to have gone a bit			0
’ finish : @entity116 celebrates after taking third position in the qualifying session of the @entity163 one question is whether @entity2 has the intellectual gifts to find the answers against the calculating , clever @entity17			1
another is whether he will resist thinking the team are against him			0
ostensibly declining to wade into psychological warfare , the @entity170 did so stealthily , saying : ‘ with regards to the championship , it ’s good for me that @entity11 is down in sixth			0
’ @entity2 finished the afternoon by , again , promising the fans more today			2
it all sounded a little hollow in the circumstances .			0

@entity2 's @entity13 @entity12 qualifying miscalculation allowed @entity17 to grab pole position
@entity2 trails @entity17 by 29 points and will start from sixth on sunday
the @entity13 driver could now miss out on the world title
