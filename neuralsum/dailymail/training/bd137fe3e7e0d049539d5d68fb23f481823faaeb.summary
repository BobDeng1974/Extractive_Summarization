with its space - age design , it would not look out of place in a theme park but its creator claims it will revolutionise the training of racehorses			1
planning permission has already been approved for the construction of the mile - long monorail system just outside the @entity12 training centre of @entity13 with work expected to being before the end of the year after the recent appointment of a project manager			1
ultimately running along the track will be a computer controlled unit housing between six and 12 horses as they exercise with controlled weights on their backs rather than riders			0
by this time next year , it should be completed and @entity29 industrialist @entity28 , who has poured $ 20million ( £ 12.4million ) into development and will spend a further £ 10m on his system ’s construction at @entity33 , is convinced the horse welfare benefits will win over any sceptic minds in racing			1
horses travel along a one - mile monorail covered system exercising on an artificial racing surface @entity29 owner @entity28 is convinced the horse welfare benefits will win over any sceptic minds @entity28 this week outlined his plans to a @entity45 delegation headed by chief executive @entity46 but he already has a prototype operating near @entity48			1
he was inspired develop @entity49 after becoming frustrated by the level of injury to his young horses when they went into training			1
he is convinced that , more often than not , riders tugging at the reins of embryonic racehorses do more damage than good			1
@entity28 says results in his homeland endorse his methods			0
he claims horses which undergo a conditioning programme of ‘ controlled exercise ’ develop stronger bones , cartilages , muscles and tendons , making them more resilient to the rigours of full training			1
units housing between six to 10 horses travel along a one - mile monorail covered system exercising on an artificial racing surface			1
loose connecting reins allow each horse freedom of movement to make exercise as natural as possible			1
system can be shut down by an operator travelling in control car behind the horses			0
automatic shutdown also checks in via sensors on the tethers if a horse stumbles or falls			0
system designed to run at speeds of up to 35mph and horses would work for up to an hour a day weights gradually increased on each horses back , starting at 20 kilos and peaking at 60 kilos			0
respiratory and heart rate monitors on each compartment @entity28 , a former president of @entity98 football club who studied the movement of wild horses in @entity101 before designing his prototype , claims his system can also play a significant role in the rehabilitation of injured horses			2
the man , who has won the @entity29 @entity108 twice with @entity109 ( 1993 ) and @entity110 ( 1999 ) , said : ‘ when i had young horses which were exciting and expected to become champions were injured too often , i felt i had to find a solution or leave the sport			0
‘ breakdowns and muscle injuries arise when horses are pushed beyond their capabilities at a very young age			2
‘ this is about making a horse ready for training			2
the idea is to make it as natural as possible with no restriction on movement			1
’ @entity28 has had horse in training with @entity128 this summer and intends to increase his @entity130 string			2
he will intend this week ’s next session of the @entity132 in @entity133 this week with bloodstock agent @entity134			0
@entity28 ’s intention is to practise what he preaches and pre-train his young stock on his system			2
he insists he can win over the traditionally conservative racing community to join him			0
‘ i know people have old habits but when they see horses going from the @entity49 to be winners they will change to new habits , ’ he said			0
he already has one convert , renowned @entity148 horse whisperer @entity146 , who said : ’ i see potential in it , amazing potential			0
