warning : ex-mi6 chief sir @entity0 said jihadists should not get the ' oxygen of publicity ' the threat posed by ' pathetic ' @entity8 jihadis is being exaggerated and the government should instead focus more on tensions such as those between @entity12 and @entity13 , the former head of @entity5 has warned			1
sir @entity0 said the 9/11 attacks put a ' distortion ' towards @entity17 extremism in the public consciousness which has remained ever since			0
and he insisted the ' oxygen of publicity ' being handed to young radicals could make them more dangerous than they really are			2
a former intelligence officer who served in @entity25 , @entity26 , the @entity27 and the @entity28 , sir @entity0 oversaw @entity5 from 1999 to 2004 during the invasion of @entity30			2
he insisted the @entity8 and @entity27 - led intervention in 2003 had ' probably very small significance ' in relation to the current wave of terror sweeping through @entity30			0
that is despite many blaming the aftermath of the war for opening up a chasm which allowed the extremist group @entity40 to take hold in key cities			0
using social media to spread their wave of terror , @entity40 militants have gained strongholds in several parts of @entity30 over the last few months			1
yesterday images emerged of almost a dozen ancient shrines and @entity51 mosques being destroyed			0
sir @entity0 's comments , on the ninth anniversary of the @entity54 bombings , came after several young @entity8 jihadis signed up to fight in @entity57 and @entity30			1
some , barely out of their teens , have appeared in recruitment videos pledging to give their lives in the name of religious fight			0
but sir @entity0 argued much of the current conflict was ' muslim on @entity66 ' and unlikely to affect those on @entity8 soil			0
in a speech to the @entity71 defence and security think tank ( @entity71 ) , he said : ' despite some of the blood - curdling claims made on our tv screens by young @entity8 jihadis ... this new conflict is essentially @entity66 on @entity66			1
wave of terror : images emerged yesterday showing almost a dozen ancient shrines and @entity51 mosques being destroyed in the @entity30 city of @entity84			1
sir @entity0 said the conflict is largely ' muslim on @entity66 ' the images were posted on a website which carries official statements from the @entity90 extremist group ' it is time to move away from the distortion that 9/11 understandably created in our national security stance			0
' counter-terrorism activity will remain an important requirement but it should no longer dominate our national security thinking and planning , rather a problem we have learned to live with and that should seldom be given , either by the government or the media , the oxygen of publicity			1
' we must continue to cover the @entity106 as a political requirement but without putting the incipient terrorist threat to ourselves at the centre of the picture and , in particular , without demonising our own @entity66 community on account of the small number of their young men who were tragically sucked into the conflict and risk returning home in an ugly and dangerous frame of mind			1
' sir @entity0 , who has been the master of @entity123 , @entity124 , since he left @entity5 in 2004 , blamed ministers for ' warning us again and again about the seriousness of the terrorist problems that we face ' and blamed the media for making extremists into ' monsters '			0
' i feel deeply uncomfortable to see our national media making national security monsters out of rather misguided young men from our @entity66 communities who frankly , i think , cut rather pathetic figures , ' he said			1
probe : security agencies in @entity30 were yesterday working to verify a video of @entity140 ( pictured ) , the leader of @entity90 , purportedly delivering a sermon at the @entity142 in @entity84 ' they achieve celebrity status beyond their wildest dreams and are probably actually encouraged by the attention towards fulfilment of some of their more extreme radical fantasies			2
' surely better to ignore them and assume the means to control them , if and when they do come home , are sufficient to meet the threat that they pose			0
' @entity8 's resources would be better - served focusing more on other issues such as the growing dominance of @entity162 or political populism in @entity164 , he said			2
the @entity12 incursion into @entity13 will have provoked a ' lively debate ' about the share of resources that should be moved from counter-terrorism to other threats , he added .			2

*ex-intelligence* chief made remarks in a speech in @entity54 yesterday
