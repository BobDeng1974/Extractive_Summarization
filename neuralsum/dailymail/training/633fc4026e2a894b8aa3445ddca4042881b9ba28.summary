by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 12:09 est , 17 october 2013 a black @entity2 actor fed up with the show ’s years long lack of any black female cast members says he refuses to dress in drag to fill the gap			1
@entity8 played many notable black women like @entity10 during his first seven seasons on snl but , as he show enters its sixth straight year without a black woman , @entity8 says someone else can pick up the slack			1
with just one other black man in this season ’s cast and with six new cast members — all of them white — the person who will play this year ’s @entity21 and @entity22 and @entity23 remains to be seen			1
@entity2 cast member @entity8 has played many women , including @entity10 , but this week he said no more			1
in protest of his show 's lack of female black women , he wo n't fill the void in a chat with tv guide , @entity30 suggested there ’s a lack of top - notch black female talent making it to snl auditions			1
‘ it 's just a tough part of the business , ’ @entity8 says			2
‘ like in auditions , they just never find ones that are ready			0
’ over its nearly 40 years on the air , @entity2 has had a grand total of four black women on its cast : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
after @entity52 ’s departure in 2007 , the show lacked a female of color and has ever since			2
four black women : in its nearly 40 years on the air , @entity2 has hired just four black women			1
the first was @entity46 , right			0
she was on for one season in 1980 - 1982			0
@entity47 , left , spent the 1985 - 86 season on the show no more : after @entity48 , left , left the cast in 1995 , there would n't be another black woman until @entity49 in 2000			1
@entity52 left in 2007 and there has n't been a black woman on the show since for critics of the show ’s casting habits , the most recent selection of six new cast members , all of them white and only one of them female , was salt in the wound			1
@entity8 ’s refusal to wear drag in order to fill the void leaves viewers wondering who will and even @entity8 does n’t have the answer			2
token ? in the midst of the furor over the show 's recent casting of six more people , all white , @entity2 announced @entity89 would host in november			1
she 'll be only the 5th woman of color to host since season 35 ‘ i do n't know			0
we just have n't done them , ’ he said			0
‘ maybe [ @entity95 ] will do it or something , but even he does n't really want to do it			0
’ @entity8 and @entity95 are the only two black cast members in this , the 39th snl season			1
in the wake of the scandal , @entity2 made a conspicuously timed announcement : @entity89 , the black star of hit show scandal , will host the show in november			2
but whether producers made the hosting choice to placate critics seeing red because of so much white on @entity2 , booking @entity111 does n’t change the makeup of the cast			2
and over the course of the last 90 episodes of the classic comedy series , only four women of color — two of them black and two @entity120 — have been tapped as hosts			0
there is hope for black comediennes , however			0
@entity95 suggest to @entity125 that @entity8 is wrong and that the talent is definitely out there			0
‘ they need to pay attention , ’ @entity95 said as he described the comedy chops of black actress @entity129 and called out snl casting directors			0
‘ why do i think she should be on the show ? because she 's black first of all , and she 's really talented			2
she needs to be on snl			0
and i believe they need to follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year			0
’ they 're out there : while @entity8 says talented black women are n't auditioning , his only black castmate @entity95 says actress @entity129 ( left and right playing @entity143 and @entity144 ) would be the perfect @entity2 addition			1

@entity8 has played @entity10 , @entity147 , and @entity148
now in his *eighth* year on @entity2 , @entity8 says he 's done with drag
@entity2 has not had a black female cast member since @entity49 in 2007
the show has hired four black women in 40 years out of about 100 cast members who *'ve* *appeared* in the show
