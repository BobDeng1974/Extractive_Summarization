@entity0 made his @entity2 debut last week against @entity3 , the first @entity5 player since november 2011 to represent the @entity2 when @entity6 made the last of his 13 caps in a 1 - 0 win over @entity9			1
@entity0 should earn plenty more after an assured performance in @entity11 on monday			1
@entity12 made the last of his 13 @entity2 caps in november last year in a 1 - 0 defeat to @entity16 , and may struggle to find another			1
silverware is a distant memory at @entity35 - 1996 was the last time fans saw it - but the managerial partnership have 28 major wins between them , including two @entity40			0
@entity0 and @entity12 would struggle to find two better midfield role models			2
every training session should be an education for the pair ; both @entity19 and @entity20 captained multiple title - winning teams and their national side from the heart of the pitch , @entity20 played over 600 times in @entity51 and @entity16 , winning numerous titles @entity19 lifts the @entity53 with @entity26 in 1999 , despite being banned for the final there was some trepidation over @entity19 's move to the @entity58			1
@entity19 would either lift @entity5 or sink them further , depending on what mood he was in and how he would work with @entity20			2
but one positive of the move was his potential influence on a middle core that had taken a beating in the last two years , a huge step down from the midfield of @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 of four years previous			0
@entity0 has already gone from strength to strength this season , continuing his form from the past 18 months and finally turning @entity76 's head enough for a call up			0
he does n't play quite like @entity19 and @entity20 did ; he is more athletic , frantic but superb on the ball , and likes to leave his foot in			2
@entity19 's influence on the 1999 campaign was huge , and is seen as one of @entity26 's best ever midfielders @entity19 lifts the @entity85 trophy in 1999 ( left ) as @entity20 lifts the @entity53 in 1997 @entity19 will know what @entity12 went through at @entity87 ; he will have seen numerous youngsters come through the ranks and fail to live up to the hype			1
but @entity5 's assistant will also be aware that both @entity76 and @entity92 saw something in the 25 - year - old when it seemed 99 per cent of the country did n't			0
he will strive , alongside @entity20 , to turn that promise into a reality			0
@entity5 's other midfield men , 24 - year - old @entity99 , who was playing in @entity100 just over two years ago , and @entity102 @entity101 , brought in from @entity103 in the summer , will not be neglected			0
@entity12 in @entity5 training this week , with @entity0 in the background after returning from @entity2 duty @entity0 is on the rise in @entity76 's eyes , while @entity12 may struggle to get back into the @entity2 side @entity99 in particular , who may lose his place in the starting xi to @entity12 , will need to show he can take the leap from being a reliable midfielder to a commanding influence on a game , and who better to learn from than the men with over 1,300 senior appearances between them			1
the @entity19 and @entity20 partnership may have sounded like a ticking time bomb at the start of the season , but they seem to have welcomed each other with open arms ( despite the video below ) and @entity5 have enjoyed a fine start to the season			2
the next five games - against @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 - will test their resolve .			0

@entity12 joined on loan from @entity26 last week
he and @entity0 will learn from @entity20 and assistant @entity19
the pair have over 1,300 senior appearances between them and 28 trophies
both captained their title - winning sides on hundreds of *occasions*
@entity12 has been ousted from the @entity2 team , while @entity0 made his debut last week against @entity3 and performed well against @entity11
