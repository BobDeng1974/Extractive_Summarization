the @entity0 have been accused of being stuffy and boring but @entity1 was determined to bring them up to date on sunday			1
the chat show host and prolific tweeter took what is being described as the ' best selfie ever ' during her hosting duties , a picture which started off as just her and @entity8 but soon expanded to include @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 in a picture taken by @entity14			2
multi-tasking @entity1 then shared the snap on her @entity17 page , where it broke the record for most retweets , with 1,076,971 in less than an hour as social media fans went wild for the snap , while continuing to host the show			1
however , it did appear as if the picture was part of a promotional stunt for @entity27 , which is a big sponsor of the show , as the selfie was taken with her @entity30 , a device which she whipped out at various stages during the proceedings			1
while @entity11 took jokes about falling over on the red carpet in her stride and @entity53 laughed as @entity1 dubbed him ' the prettiest of them all ' , @entity49 looked less than impressed when @entity1 quipped she thought she was a male impersonator			1
taking to the stage at @entity58 's @entity57 , seven years after she last presented , @entity1 joked : ' the real captain @entity59 is here tonight and the real @entity60 and one of the most impressive @entity49 impersonators i 've ever seen in my entire life			1
' get it together ; @entity1 worked to get all of the celebrities together for the sot and they were all eager to get involved group hug : the entire group huddled up close as they all tried to get themselves into the picture on the phone what about me ? @entity76 was too short to make it into the epic selfie while the audience and @entity76 's sister @entity80 howled with laughter , @entity76 looked less than amused and merely cracked a small smile			1
apart from a less than warm reception from @entity49 , @entity1 won over the a-list crowd with her gentle opening monologue			1
she opened with a quip about the recent rain in @entity58 and the inability of everyone to cope with it : ' for those of you watching around the world , it has been a tough couple of days for us , it 's been raining			2
thank you for your prayers			2
' she also gently ribbed the academy for not deviating very much in their voting patterns			2
most star - studded selfie ever ? stars including @entity53 , @entity11 and @entity103 along with @entity10 and @entity104 got involved int he snap taken by @entity14 @entity1 joked : ' things are so different now			1
for example last time i was here @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity8 and @entity112 were nominated			2
' she teased 84 - year - old nominee @entity114 about her age , saying : ' there are some first time nominees here – @entity114 is nominated for @entity119			2
at 84 years old she is the oldest nominee			2
[ to june ] i 'm telling everyone that you were in @entity119			2
' and @entity58 's obsession with youth was also called out , with the tuxedo clad host saying : ' tonight 's theme is heroes in @entity58 and we need heroes more than ever			0
' i 'm not saying movies are the most important thing in the world but we all know that the most important thing is youth			0
sponsored tweet ? @entity1 took the selfie with her @entity27 phone , and the company is a big sponsor of the @entity0 we 're down : @entity17 crashed during the broadcast after @entity1 's tweet went viral ' i 'm kidding , the most important thing is love , family and friendship and if people do n’t have that they get into showbiz			1
' @entity1 then suggested that maybe she was the biggest winner of the night			1
' you should think of yourself as winners , ' she said			0
' not all of you but those who have won before			0
and i know what you 're thinking			0
" @entity1 you 've been chosen as host and that 's the highest award there is "			1
' while the nominees are all successful in their field , the host pointed out the lack of education among them : between all of the nominees here you 've made 1,400 films and attended six years of college			0
' working out the logistics : everyone scrambled to try to figure out how best to put the picture together as a fascinated audience looked on ' i 've got this ! ' @entity14 took charge and made sure he got the perfect picture at the @entity0 she then picked one nominee out of of the crowd : ' @entity178 you went to college right ? what no ? ok			1
well you 're amazing actress and you 're in not one but two nominated films tonight and that is so , what is the word for this , selfish			0
' she also pleaded with the academy to stop nominating @entity8 , saying the star could no longer afford all of the gowns and make - up which are needed for awards season			0
it 's been an exceptional year for movies , one of the nominees is her , and by her i mean @entity8 , ' @entity1 joked			1
' @entity8 has been nominated for an @entity0 a total of 18 times			1
' it sounds good but if you do the math between dresses , hair and make - up , that 's hundreds of thousands of dollars			0
simply put @entity8 can not afford to be nominated again			0
' still not forgiven ? @entity76 still did not look happy even though she clutched on to @entity1 's arm for a picture she compared the @entity0 to the @entity209 and brought up @entity11 falling on her way to the stage last year to accept her award			1
' who are we kidding ? it ’s @entity216			0
there are cameras everywhere , you ’re starving , @entity11 won last year … @entity11 i am not going to bring up what happened last year when you fell ... ' @entity1 began			1
' for those who do n’t know when @entity11 won last year she tripped on the way up			0
and when you fell getting out of the car tonight – no one needs to know that			0
' but if you win tonight i think we should bring you the @entity0 , i do n’t wan na risk it			1
' and @entity53 did n't escape the gentle teasing , with @entity1 quipping : ' win or lose you look beautiful			1
' cate you look beautiful and @entity234 but let ’s be honest @entity53 is the most beautiful of all			0
@entity238 is also pretty but a rugged dirty pretty			0
' @entity1 continued : both are nominated for @entity240			1
it deals with the serious issue of people who have sex at the rodeos			0
it looks good but do n't do it			0
' ' good job sir ! ' @entity49 was less than impressed when @entity1 jokingly mistook her for a male impersonator at least someone finds it funny : @entity76 's sister @entity80 broke into howls of laughter at the quip and that was her segue into a joke about actor @entity259			1
' speaking of sex at the rodeos , @entity259 is here , ' @entity1 said to a chorus of laughter , especially from the actor 's daughter @entity264			1
' a bit of background on @entity259 , his grandfather was the governor of @entity269 , his granduncle was a @entity271 winning poet and his godmother was @entity273 ... and here you are among us tonight			2
what went wrong ? ' pizza for everyone : @entity1 handed out pizza to the assembled stars before trying to get them to chip in keep some for me : @entity10 jumped up to grab some pizza from the deliveryman from @entity285 pizzas @entity286 was next in the firing line when the comedian brought up his memorable scene in @entity290 where his character exposes his private parts at a pool party			1
she said : ' @entity286 is nominated for his amazing performance in @entity290			0
you showed us something in that film which i have n't seen for a very very long time			0
' she finished with a rather poignant joke about how the ceremony could end : ' anything can happen			0
possibility one , @entity304 wins the @entity306			0
' possibility number two , you 're all racists			0
' digging in : both @entity8 and @entity9 dug in to the delicious pies from the comapny she can take some gentle teasing : @entity11 roared with laughter as @entity1 poked fun at her for falling both last year and this year later , @entity1 had the entire auditorium in fits of laughter as she ordered pizza for everyone			2
@entity10 , @entity53 and @entity112 all reached for a slice , delivered by a pizza man from @entity285 pizza place on @entity322			0
@entity1 tried to get well known faces including @entity324 to chip in for the food , joking that there was no pressure but the show was being beamed live to a huge audience who would judge him for not giving money			2
hilarious : @entity1 kept @entity9 laughing with her quips during the evening winning everyone over : @entity110 and his mother @entity335 , @entity286 and @entity112 could n't stop laughing at @entity1 's jokes so far the reviews of @entity339 ' hosting have been good with @entity341 's tv columnist @entity340 saying her opening monologue ' screamed of a desire to dial back the show to safer terrain			2
' this refers to last year 's host , @entity350 creator @entity349 's risque approach to the show , which included jokes about gays , @entity354 and a song aimed actresses who have gone nude in movies called ' @entity358 '			0
the @entity359 continued the praise for @entity1 , stating that the comedienne ' told jokes that were easy on the ears , gentle on the mind and , for the most part , sparingly nice			2
' the @entity367 author , @entity366 , said : ' well , it 's over			0
and i think @entity1 did a superb job as the host for the @entity0			1
' one person who certainly was n't enjoying the show was @entity374 , who spent the evening mocking @entity1 and the production : ' i should host the # @entity0 just to shake things up - this is not good ! ' proud wife : @entity378 holds hands with @entity1 as they head to the @entity0 governor 's ball after the show foreign language @entity383 , @entity384 , @entity385			1
