by @entity0 it ’s always important to have a deep squad , and @entity3 will be delighted to have @entity4 in his			1
with @entity6 out , @entity5 has taken on the bulk of responsibilities up front , but @entity4 is now playing an absolutely vital role			1
he was a super sub at @entity12 , scoring after coming on at half - time , and he now has four goals in his last four league games for @entity16			1
matchwinner : @entity4 netted the only goal of the game for @entity16 against @entity12 under sir @entity20 , @entity4 was struggling to score			1
now @entity3 has him doing that			1
earlier this month he told @entity4 to follow @entity5 ’s example and stay behind after training to work on his finishing			1
it ’s amazing to hear a manager having to encourage his players to work harder ; that should be par for the course			2
i always looked at senior players and followed their work ethic but , in fairness , it seems to be working			2
since the start of december , @entity4 ’s scored twice as many goals as he had during the rest of the season and his shooting accuracy has improved by 10 per cent			1
@entity41 's pass master @entity42 has been one of the signings of the season			1
the price of £ 5.25m was good business for @entity41 , good for @entity47 and good for @entity42			1
he ’s playing football and he ’s become a bit of a cult hero			2
he ’s such a technical footballer , has two great feet and he strikes the ball so cleanly			2
he hit a fierce shot with his left foot to score against @entity54 and then smashed a 35 - yard free - kick against the bar with his right			2
he hit it just like @entity59			2
i love that @entity61 has brought in good footballers and @entity41 are n’t afraid to attack			1
@entity63 and @entity64 were both terrific on saturday , and @entity42 orchestrates it all , sitting deep in that quarterback position			1
he really makes the team play and is one of the best passers in the league , he can put it on a sixpence from 50 yards			1
he ’s formed a good midfield partnership with @entity73 in the middle , and it helps that they both know each other from their @entity47 days			0
there is a chance that @entity79 could be recalled by @entity80 , who is a fan , but @entity42 is at @entity41 to stay , and what a great signing he has been for @entity61			1
clinical : @entity4 scored his fourth goal in as many @entity85 games at @entity86 in action : @entity42 ( right ) was in stunning form against @entity54 on saturday afternoon goal threat : @entity42 had a trim after finally scoring for @entity41 at the @entity91 influential : @entity42 dominated in midfield , as his heat map from the @entity54 clash shows @entity95 is still no bad thing i ’d love to ask @entity97 if he would take fourth place now			1
i fancied my old side for a @entity101 spot this season but never thought they would be title contenders			0
they ’re by no means out of it because this is a crazy season but in the last four seasons they have finished , on average , 27.5 points behind the title winners			0
to make up that difference in one season is a huge ask			0
down but not out : @entity114 was unable to find the back of the net against a resolute @entity118 side they ’ve not been close for a number of years so they ’re not yet used to that winning consistency , but it will come			0
they have benefited from not being in @entity125 this season , but the @entity101 needs @entity127 in it			0
more than just a bench - warmer another striker that ’s showing the value of a big squad is @entity133			1
he will see himself as a first - team player but with the form of @entity137 and @entity138 , his chances have been limited this season			1
he ’s a great player to have on the bench — he has scored 13 goals in 43 substitute appearances — but he will want more			0
he ’s big , strong in the air and talented , and most teams would love to have him			2
imagine the damage @entity118 would do if he was leading the line			0
it shows @entity41 ’s strength , and @entity133 will be important for them over the next few weeks with @entity137 out injured			1
crucial : @entity133 stepped up to the plate for @entity152 in their tight win against @entity154 clinical : @entity133 's intelligent movement created a space for @entity158 to pick him out in the penalty area @entity161 's magic when he first arrived , i wondered whether @entity164 would be @entity166 ’s kind of player			1
he likes his wingers to work hard but i think he knows that , even if he does n’t track back , @entity164 is a match - winner			0
they almost fell out when @entity164 skipped training but @entity166 managed him well and you forget he ’s still only 22			0
just like that : @entity164 celebrates his equaliser against @entity127 at @entity174 @entity176 chaos i thought i ’d seen everything in football until saturday night			0
the sight of @entity180 booing after the final whistle was utterly bizarre and it would be almost comical if it was n’t such a desperate situation for the @entity176 fans			0
it does n’t matter if he was booing his own players or his own fans , it ’s not the kind of behaviour you would expect from an owner , but then @entity180 is not your average owner			0
he has already changed the club ’s colours from blue to red , helped fund @entity176 ’s promotion to the @entity85 and then sacked an incredibly popular manager in @entity201			0
opinionated : @entity180 was filmed booing at the final whistle after @entity176 's 2 - 2 draw against @entity203 @entity176 fans have waited more than 50 years to get back in the top flight , but so far their season has been engulfed in farce			2
fans can put up with a lot of things if they feel the owner is committed and puts his money in , but their current situation is ridiculous			0
they need to bring in a manager and are keen on @entity215 , but will he want to work with @entity180 ? there ’s no doubt any manager would love to manage a club like @entity176 , but with @entity180 in charge , they may not be quite so happy to take the risk			2
@entity223 to admire amid all the madness at @entity176 , there was one bright light for them on saturday : @entity223			0
he ’s only 22 , but the midfielder is a fluid mover and good on the ball			0
he ’s got an extra yard of pace that sets you apart and he has a fantastic attitude			0
people might criticise some of @entity201 ’s signings , but @entity223 was a bargain at £ 2million from @entity238 and could develop into something special			0
stunned : @entity223 scored @entity176 's opening goal against @entity203 from range			2

@entity3 must love having @entity4 in his @entity16 squad
@entity133 has *key* role to play at @entity246 in @entity137 's *absence*
@entity42 is a pass master at @entity41
