a leaked internal email written by a casting agent at @entity2 said that from now on they 'll only be hiring ' real models ’ and not ‘ @entity6 hoes or @entity7 ' in an attempt to rebrand their image			1
former ceo @entity11 who created the concept behind the company 's diverse ads was fired last year following the brand 's willful misconduct claims that he ' acted inappropriately ' and ' harassed employees			1
' the @entity18 obtained the the email written on march 18 by model caster @entity20 that read , ' “ [ the ] company is going through a rebranding image , so we will be shooting models moving forward			1
' leaked email : a leaked email written by model casting agent @entity20 said the company would only be hiring ' real models ' not ' @entity30 ' ' real models			1
not @entity6 hoes or @entity34 , ' he continued in the email meant for employee eyes only			2
@entity7 is an acronym for the saying , ' that ho over there			1
' after the email surfaced , @entity20 replied with an apology for what he wrote and said it ' was just an inappropriate off colour joke that was not intended to defame the clients name or philosophy / views in anyway , ’ reports @entity48			1
@entity48 also reported that just last week , @entity2 ’s new senior vice president of marketing , @entity49 , allegedly told employees that they would not hire models who were ' too short and round , ' three sources who were at the meeting told @entity48			1
“ it ’s become a running joke around the office — like , " i ca n’t do this , i ’m too short and round , ' said one employee who alleges they heard heard the remark			0
' i ’ve never felt marginalised or unattractive working for this company until his past week or so , ' that employee added			0
real women : @entity2 has been known to accept model submissions from around the globe and have featured models of all shapes and all sizes @entity73 responded @entity74 in a statement that said , ' this is completely false			1
@entity2 embraces body types of all shapes , ethnicities and sizes , and our model casting has and will continue to reflect this			1
' @entity2 is notorious for their ads of scantily clad ' amateur models ' of all sizes and the company was known to accept model submissions from ' real women ' around the globe			1
despite the company 's public attempt to distance themselves from their old image , the @entity2 website still says nothing about their desire to use more conventional models			1
‘ we find our models all over the world , through online submissions , word of mouth , and in retail stores , where we 've been known to do an impromptu test shoot or two			0
our ads have always been indicative of a time and place in @entity2 's identity , which has evolved into a 12,000 employee worldwide collaboration			2
explore the online ad archives for a closer look at our ads featuring models , factory inner - workings and the global vernacular that inspires us , ’ the website states			0
one rebranding change made obvious on the website last week is the company ’s choice to airbrush out some of the models ' exposed nipples and body hair making them look more like plastic mannequins			2
nip no nip : the model on the left in see through white lingerie once had her nipples and pubic hair in full display more like the model in the back lingerie on the right @entity136 first reported that the changes could be seen on the company 's lingerie page in the ' new ' section and a brunette model in translucent lingerie who once had more showing was edited to be much less exposed			2
@entity11 's replacement ceo @entity145 has said she is attempting to make the brand ' relevant to millennials ' without it bordering on ' pornographic			1
' ' this is an edgy brand and it ’s always going to be an edgy brand , and it ’s about social commentary , it ’s about gay rights , and it ’s about immigration reform			0
it ’s about the things millennials care about , ' @entity145 told the @entity159 in january			0
while many may welcome the company 's attempt to shave away their previous image , some activists think showing nipple is perfectly fine and empowers women in what otherwise may be a mannequin 's world			2
@entity170 , co-founder of the nipple printed bikini line @entity173 thinks that by censoring women and making them look like mannequins or dolls , the company is actually taking power away from women who should not feel ashamed of their bodies			0
fired : former ceo @entity11 was fired after the company accused him of willful misconduct @entity170 told @entity136 that @entity2 has tried to reach out to diverse audiences by coming out with t - shirts that say ' legalize gay ' and ' legalize @entity184 ' but have very little to comment on women 's equality			1
' to see them taking a strong stance on those issues but not on women ’s equality is disappointing , ' said @entity170 who runs the feminist clothing line with her partner @entity192			0
' this is a company that is clearly trying to distance themselves from their founder , ' she continued			0
' it ’s kind of laughable for them to think that removing nipples from their images of their sheer lingerie is the best way to do this considering their questionable ad choices in recent years			0
this is a step in the wrong direction and is contributing to the sexualisation of a woman ’s body at a time where there is a large and growing movement for equality			0
' the clothing company has a tab on their website dedicated to political activism and they offer a stance on gay rights and immigration reform			0
' as a company , we have certain resources that individual activists do not			0
we try to use that special ability to support political causes that need help			0
@entity2 regularly uses its billboards , advertisements , press contacts and even printed t - shirts to speak out about important issues			2
our two biggest issues have been @entity237 and @entity238 , ' says their website			0
the company 's female ceo has yet to comment on women 's sexuality and empowerment and the company 's choice to airbrush out nipples and pubic hair			2
the models of @entity2 may soon have a new look altogether as the company attempts to truncate their old image .			1

the leaked email written on march 18 by casting agent @entity20 said the company would be hiring real models not ' thots or @entity256 '
' @entity20 apologized by saying that the email was just an ' off colour joke '
@entity7 is an acronym for the saying , ' that ho over there . '
