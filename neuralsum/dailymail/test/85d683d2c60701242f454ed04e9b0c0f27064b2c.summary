@entity1 supreme leader ayatollah @entity0 on thursday demanded that all sanctions on @entity1 be lifted at the same time as any final agreement with world powers on curbing @entity6 's nuclear program is reached			1
@entity0 , the @entity8 's most powerful figure and who has the last say on all state matters , was making his first comments on the interim deal reached last week in the @entity15 city of @entity16			2
in remarks apparently meant to keep hardline loyalists in line , he warned about ' deceptive ' intentions of the @entity21			0
@entity22 reported that the crowd chanted ' death to @entity21 ! ' during the speech			2
' instant annulment of all sanction is one of the demands of our officials , ' @entity0 said in a speech broadcast live on state television , ' according to translations published by @entity22 and the nonprofit @entity34			0
but he hedged on whether there will be a deal in place at all by the june 30 deadline			0
' i neither support nor oppose the deal , since nothing has happened yet , ' he said			0
' all the trouble arises when the details will be discussed ; it may be that the deceptive other side wants to restrict us in the details			0
' these include nuclear - related @entity70 resolutions as well as @entity21 and @entity72 nuclear - related economic sanctions			2
' all # sanctions should be removed just when the deal is reached , ' @entity0 tweeted later			2
' if sanctions removal depends on another process then why [ have ] we started to talk ? ' a senior @entity79 defense official said in a radio interview after the speech that @entity1 could still obtain a nuclear weapon if sanctions were lifted immediately , and would have more money to spend on arming regional proxies			2
' the moment the sanctions are removed , tens of billions [ of dollars ] will flow to their coffers , ' @entity86 predicted			0
' they will get rich			0
they will have the power to support the entire network of missiles and rockets			0
' the @entity97 on thursday repeated its position that sanctions against @entity1 would be removed gradually			1
' under the agreed - upon parameters , sanctions will be suspended in a phased manner upon verification that @entity1 has met specific commitments , ' @entity97 spokesman @entity100 said during a daily press briefing			1
' we 're not going to respond to every public statement made by @entity1 officials , ' @entity100 said , ' or negotiate in public			0
' @entity97 spokesman @entity100 held firm , saying ' sanctions will be suspended in a phased manner upon verification that @entity1 has met specific commitments ' one of those statements , from @entity0 , accused the @entity56 of misleading the world with its claims of what was in the framework agreed to in @entity15			1
' @entity21 put out a statement just a few hours after our negotiators finished their talks ... this statement , which they called a " fact sheet , " was wrong on most of the issues , ' @entity0 said during his speech			1
' in most regards , ' he claimed , it ' was faulty , incorrect and contrary to the substance of the negotiations			2
' in the @entity21 , @entity133 , press director at @entity134 , told @entity135 that @entity6 has a good chance of winning a tug - of - war over what secretary of state @entity138 and his @entity1 counterpart @entity140 actually agreed to			1
' the @entity1 have a 100 per cent record of forcing the @entity21 to bow to their interpretation whenever there 's a dispute over @entity1 concessions publicly declared by the @entity149 administration , including and specifically on fact sheets , ' @entity142 said thurdsay			1
' there 's a good reason why @entity153 is increasingly worried , even as @entity21 negotiators assure them that they 're telling the truth			0
' @entity157 , a senior fellow at the @entity34 , told @entity135 that up - front lifting of sanctions is a bad idea that might be put into practice anyway			0
' a gradual lifting of sanctions in return for each step taken by @entity6 is the only way to secure @entity6 's cooperation in the future , ' @entity157 said			0
' we are also concerned the @entity149 administration is so desperate for a nuclear deal , that @entity171 will give more concessions to @entity6 , ' he added			1
' secretary of state @entity138 played a major role in nuclear negotiations that some observers now say are unraveling quickly @entity0 claimed thursday that the @entity56 had lied about the substance of talks in @entity15 another area in which the parties seem to disagree is the question of monitoring and access to @entity1 's nuclear sites			1
while @entity138 and @entity149 have emphasized expectations that @entity1 will let @entity185 inspectors tour and inspect their facilities at any time , @entity0 threw cold water on the idea			1
' any unconventional inspection or monitoring which would make @entity1 into a special case , ' he said thursday , ' would not be acceptable			0
' ' foreign monitoring on # @entity1 's security is nâ€™t allowed , ' he added on @entity195			2
@entity1 defense minister @entity196 also told the state - run @entity198 news agency on thursday that @entity1 had not agreed to let international inspectors enter its nuclear facilities , which are typically enclosed on military installations			0
@entity157 of the @entity34 said his group is ' concerned the @entity149 administration is so desperate for a nuclear deal , that @entity171 will give more concessions to @entity6 ' ' no such agreement has been made , ' @entity207 said			1
' principally speaking , visit to military centers is among our redlines and no such visit will be accepted			0
' @entity0 and @entity62 spoke during a ceremony on thursday marking @entity1 's @entity215			1
' our goal in the talks is to preserve our nation 's nuclear rights , ' @entity62 said			1
' the @entity1 nation has been and will be the victor in the negotiations			1
' the @entity21 and @entity72 sanctions have choked off nearly 1.5 million barrels of @entity1 exports per day since early 2012 , reducing its daily oil exports by 60 percent to around 1 million barrels			1
the tentative accord was a step towards a settlement that would allay @entity233 fears that @entity1 could build an atomic bomb , with economic sanctions on @entity6 being lifted in return			2
negotiators from @entity1 , the @entity21 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 will resume negotiations in the coming days to pave the way for a final deal			1
since relations with @entity171 collapsed after @entity1 's 1979 @entity248 revolution , enmity towards the @entity21 has always been a rallying point for @entity1 hardliners			1
' i was never optimistic about negotiating with @entity21 ... nonetheless i agreed to the negotiations and supported , and still support , the negotiators , ' @entity0 said , ' i support a deal that preserves the interests and honor of @entity1			1
' the @entity21 and its @entity233 allies say it is vital that @entity1 fully cooperate with a @entity70 @entity185 ( @entity185 ) investigation into past nuclear activities that could be related to making weapons			2
@entity79 defense official @entity86 predicted that when @entity1 sanctions are dropped , ' they will get rich ' and ' will have the power to support the entire network of missiles and rockets ' @entity0 is now saying no foreign inspectors , including those from the @entity185 , will be allowed to tour the military facilities where @entity1 's nuclear operations are housed @entity0 ruled out any ' extraordinary supervision measures ' over @entity1 's nuclear activities			1
' @entity1 's military sites can not be inspected under the excuse of nuclear supervision , ' he said			1
a final deal would require a vigorous monitoring framework to ensure @entity1 compliance			0
the negotiators have been working out a monitoring mechanism that would involve the @entity185			0
this has not been considered a sticking point in the nuclear talks			0
@entity239 , which has demanded more stringent conditions on @entity1 , said the comments by the @entity1 leadership showed that reaching a final deal would be difficult and that in any case there would need to be a mechanism in place to restore sanctions if @entity6 violated its commitments			1
' subjects still remain that we are n't agreed on , notably on economic sanctions , and the @entity300 has made statements that show there is still a lot of work to be done , ' foreign minister @entity296 told lawmakers			0
' we are going to keep the position we have held from the beginning , which is constructive but extremely demanding , ' @entity296 said			0
@entity0 also said the tentative deal did not guarantee reaching a comprehensive deal by a june 30 deadline			0
' what has been achieved so far does not guarantee a deal or even that the negotiations will continue to the end , ' @entity0 said , adding that an extension of the deadline should not be a problem			0
he then reiterated @entity1 denials that @entity6 was seeking to build a nuclear weapon .			2

@entity1 's president @entity62 assured the crowd that ' the @entity1 nation has been and will be the victor in the negotiations '
@entity0 said in a speech that ' sanctions must all be completely removed on the day of the agreement '
@entity97 insisted hours later that ' sanctions will be suspended in a phased manner '
@entity1 ' supreme leader ' said @entity56 's public summary of talks ' was faulty , incorrect and contrary to the substance of the negotiations '
