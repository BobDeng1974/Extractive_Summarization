by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 18:56 est , 18 september 2013 every morning after breakfast , before @entity5 leaves the house for university , the 23 - year - old knocks back something a little stronger than just a coffee to help her get through the day			1
as she pops two @entity11 tablets into her mouth , the law student says : ' it 's a preventative measure			0
they give me the confidence that i can spend each day virtually pain - free			2
on other days , i take paracetamol and @entity18			0
' it may sound extreme , but @entity5 , who lives with her parents in @entity21 , @entity22 , is part of @entity24 , the phrase coined after a recent report found a third of all 18 to 24 - year - olds in the @entity28 take over-the - counter ( @entity30 ) pain medication daily			1
nine years of addiction : @entity5 started taking @entity11 tablets aged 14 ( right ) after suffering from a series of debilitating headaches that plagued her adolescence take @entity5 's pill - popping habit			2
she began dosing herself with painkillers aged 14 , after the first of a series of debilitating headaches that went on to plague her adolescence			2
her parents suffered from migraines and @entity5 's gp decided she did , too			0
but his recommendation , she says , to start taking codeine - based @entity30 painkillers saw @entity5 unwittingly embark on an entirely legal opiate addiction , which still has her in its grip nearly a decade later			1
most of us have a packet of painkillers in our bathroom cabinet - but just because you can buy them in a chemist or supermarket without a prescription does n't mean they 're safe			1
few people realise that codeine , available in a variety of @entity30 painkillers , is a potentially addictive opiate - a narcotic , like morphine and heroin , derived from the opium - producing poppy plant			1
and just this week , research showed that paracetamol - based @entity70 - the most seemingly innocuous drug of all - could even be responsible for increasing rates of asthma in children			1
' we certainly encounter significant numbers of people who do abuse painkilling medication , ' says @entity79 , of the charity @entity80			2
' it is an increasing problem			0
' @entity5 admits she would be very nervous about giving her tablets up : ' i still get headaches all the time but they do n't progress to migraines very often and i 'm convinced that 's because i 'm dependent on painkillers			1
' trapped : aspiring novelist @entity90 started taking painkillers when she was 16 to try and alleviate her stress headaches regular codeine users quickly become dependent , explains @entity94 , a consultant neurologist at @entity96 & @entity95 , and chairman of the @entity98 for the @entity99 , because they soon find they need more and more of it to relieve the same pain			1
' when they stop taking it they get withdrawal symptoms : irritability , insomnia , restlessness , sweating , anxiety , ' he says			0
' so they take more			0
' there are restrictions - pharmacists are not supposed to sell more than one pack of 24 tablets of codeine - based painkillers at a time - so @entity5 stocks up whenever she can : ' my bag is always filled with them			1
i feel panicky if i forget to put some in my purse			0
' stress is a major factor in @entity5 's continuing usage - as it was for most of those interviewed for the report , who said they took painkillers to relieve tension headaches ; almost half think their generation faces more stress than any other			1
' there 's a huge amount of pressure on my generation , to do well at university and then to get a good job and a mortgage - something that 's never been tougher , ' says @entity5			2
she lives with her parents and works hard to fund her studies , giving piano , maths and @entity142 lessons to children on the side			0
' i ca n't let headaches stand in the way of my commitments or my future			2
' that 's a sentiment that @entity150 echoes			0
when the 25 - year - old events manager from @entity152 began suffering from a bad back , that caused headaches and pain in his neck , he started taking codeine - based painkillers to allow him to carry on working			1
six months later , he 's still taking them - despite the warning on the packets that they should not be taken for more than three days			2
' they 're a saviour in enabling me to get on with my job , ' he explains			0
' as an event manager i can be on my feet for 15 to 20 hours a day			0
the painkillers give me the peace of mind that i 'll be able to do so			2
' he recognises that he is now utterly reliant on painkillers : ' i imagined that the amount of codeine in the tablets i buy in the chemist would n't cause a problem , but i ca n't function properly without them due to the pain			1
i 'm at a crucial stage in building my career and savings so that i can eventually buy a house			0
' i 'm devoted to my job and do n't want to have to take any time off sick with a back problem			2
i feel that it 's not something i should have at my age			0
' it 's an easy trap to fall into , as 34 - year - old @entity90 , an aspiring novelist from @entity191 , knows			1
when she was 16 , her mother , eager to end her daughter 's constant stress headaches , brought home a packet of @entity197 , an @entity30 painkiller containing paracetamol and codeine			1
' he was groggy , not his normal self , and i thought : “ i take these things every day and this is what it does to a grown man ? ” ' they worked instantly , but quickly turned into a daily habit - and @entity90 discovered that unless she upped her dose , her headaches got worse and worse			1
most days , she would take two tablets - on bad days , it could be four or six			2
but neither she nor her parents realised there was anything wrong : ' we did n't see it as a big deal			2
it was like taking a cough sweet or something , ' she says			0
soon , the once bright and athletic teen became too exhausted to do anything			0
whenever @entity90 stopped taking it , her withdrawal symptoms left her anxious , sick and drained of energy - and , ironically , gave her more headaches			2
she was 29 - 15 years into her dependence on codeine - before she realised the drug might be the source of her problems			1
' my boyfriend , @entity233 , had a headache , and i said : “ oh , take a couple of my tablets			0
” he took some and was absolutely floored - he fell asleep for a couple of hours and afterwards said : “ how do you take these all the time ? i feel terrible			0
” ' he was groggy , not his normal self , and i thought : “ i take these things every day and this is what it does to a grown man ? ” ' @entity90 's @entity24 referred her for counselling - and when she confessed to taking a packet of @entity197 a day , she was horrified to be told she was addicted to the codeine : ' i do n't smoke , do n't really drink , do n't agree with drugs at all - i just thought they were innocuous			1
' @entity90 was then referred to an addiction treatment centre - where they proposed putting her on methadone , which is usually used to wean addicts off heroin			1
' it was an immense shock , ” she says			0
' they were saying things like “ when did you last shoplift ? ” , “ how did you meet your dealer ? ” , and i 'm thinking , “ i go to the chemist ! i 've never shoplifted in my life			0
i 'm in completely the wrong place ”			0
' fighting it : @entity90 , pictured here in her twenties when she well into her addiction , eventually went to an addiction treatment centre and mastered her dependency and codeine can also be a killer			0
in the past decade the annual number of deaths in which some form of codeine has been implicated has almost tripled , from 46 in 2001 to 120 in 2012			1
that 's not far short of the 154 deaths in 2011 caused by the opioid - like @entity278 , a prescription - only painkiller the @entity281 is now looking at reclassifying as a @entity283 drug			1
for doctors such as @entity94 , who see the consequences of such codeine addiction daily , the answer is clear - he would like over-the - counter codeine banned in the @entity28 , as it is in the @entity289 and many other countries			1
yet the government regulator says that it has never considered making codeine solely a prescription - only medicine			1
and @entity30 painkillers are big business to the pharmaceutical industry			1
in the last year , sales of adult painkillers hit an all - time high of more than 25 million packs - at least 754 million pills			1
though @entity150 and @entity5 are still struggling to cut down their intake , for @entity90 , hooked on codeine from the age of 16 to 29 , there has been a happy ending			0
shocked by the suggested methadone treatment , she decided to go ' cold turkey ' on her own : ' it was horrible , but it passed and i 'm really glad i did it , ' she says			0
deadly pills : the number of deaths in which codeine has been implicated over the past decade has almost tripled ' as the weeks went by the fog started to clear , the exhaustion lifted and , for the first time in 15 years , i started remembering what it was like to feel normal			1
' once a college drop - out who struggled to find a job , in 2011 @entity90 celebrated by marrying @entity233 , the man who helped her kick the codeine habit			2
she has since completed a masters degree in creative writing , and is working on a novel			0
' i ca n't believe i lost so many years to over-the - counter drugs , ' she says			1
' now i just want to warn people about the dangers of medication			0
we all assume anything we can get over the counter is harmless , but that 's not the case			0
' additional reporting by @entity339 .			0

a third of 18 to 24 - year - olds take over-the - counter ( @entity30 ) medication daily
members of @entity24 often do n't realise they could be addicts
@entity348 , available in a variety of @entity30 painkillers , is a narcotic
regular codeine users quickly become dependent on it
and the drug can be fatal : deaths related to codeine have tripled since 2001
