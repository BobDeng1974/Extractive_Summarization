it 's the holy grail for @entity1 and @entity3 fans , but it seems a bright blue headed lizard has already developed its own invisibility cloak			1
biologists were baffled as to how male @entity8 emerald lizards have evolved their vivid blue and green colouring			1
while the brightly coloured skin it useful for attracting a mate , it should also make them easy for predators to spot			2
however , researchers from the @entity17 in @entity18 and the @entity19 of @entity20 , @entity21 , have found that these 15 inch long lizards have a secret weapon against hungry @entity24 - their own cloaking device			1
iberian emerald lizard 's skin makes the invisible from above but gives them bright colours at ground level they discovered that the lizards ' skin is iridescent and reflects light in different ways depending on the angle it is viewed from			1
scientists from the @entity39 have discovered a way to hide large objects from sight using inexpensive and readily available lenses			0
their device , called the @entity45 , uses four lenses in a line at specific distances from each other to make objects at the right distance appear invisible			0
it is one of the first cloaking methods to hide objects in three directions when viewed at varying angles in visible light			2
they constructed the £ 600 device they aligned the lenses at a precise length			0
the lenses then need to be paired up and separated by the sum of their focal lengths - which is the distance from the lens that an object comes into focus			0
doing this will make objects that are placed between the third and fourth lens , or specific positions between the others , invisible			0
the background behind the equipment , however , will remain visible when viewed through other lenses			0
scaling up the sizes of the lenses can then also increase the size of the cloaking effect			0
when viewed from above , the creatures blend into their background and become almost invisible to birds			1
however , when viewed from ground level , the lizards still stand out brightly - meaning fellow lizards can easily spot those looking for mate			1
dr @entity89 , a biologist at the @entity90 , say their findings are the first evidence of iridescent colours being used by animals to alter their visibility depending on viewing angle			0
he said : ' our results suggest that the blue heads are less striking for a bird above the lizard than a lizard in the same plane			0
' birds see a less uv pure colour that is more whitish and less chromatically conspicuous when seeing the lizards from above			2
' it seems that birds may be the more probable predators of these relatively large lizards - some snakes and probably mammals , which see lizards horizontally , can also predate on lizards , but more probably only on young lizards , which do not show the conspicuous blue heads			2
' @entity8 emerald lizards , also named @entity119 , are mainly found in the open rocky shrubland in the mountainous areas of northern @entity18 and @entity21			1
they are currently classified as @entity123 on the @entity124 and mainly eats insects and other small lizards			0
while the females tend to remain fairly well camouflaged against the rock and shrubs that fill the landscape where they live , the males develop vivid green bodies and bright blue heads as they reach sexual maturity			1
as these reptiles hunt during the day , it means the males should be highly conspicuous			0
the male @entity8 emerald lizard has a blue head and green body that the plain brown and green females find irresistible , but these bright colours actually help them blend into their background when viewed from above the scientists measured the light reflected from the skin of male @entity8 emerald lizards ( labelled l ) from different angles and found that birds of prey ( labelled p ) , which normally see the lizards from above , find harder to see than female lizards ( c ) which will tend to be on the same level on the ground with the males the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity163 , used 10 captured adult males from the @entity165 in @entity18 and measured the light reflected from their skin at different angles			1
they found that when viewed from the same level , the lizard 's skin reflected the widest spectrum of light , making them appear more colourful			1
however , when viewed from above , their skin appeared far duller and reflected less light , particularly in the blue and ultraviolet end of the spectrum			1
as birds tend to see far more ultraviolet light than humans , this should make the lizards harder to see			1
however , the difference in reflection is difficult for human eyes to see vision in birds is quite different from our own			0
physicists have been trying to create material that works like @entity1 's invisibility cloak for decades but it appears the @entity8 emerald lizard has cracked the problem already to hide itself from avian predators the scientists then compared the amount of contrast the lizards had against different backgrounds found in their habitat , such as rock , wood and the laurel - leaved rock rose and the dried leaves from the @entity207 oak			1
they found that the lizards ' blue heads were far more conspicious to other lizards on the same plane as the lizards than to birds of prey flying above			2
this suggests their brightly coloured iridescent skin actually helps the male lizards to blend into their background			2
dr @entity89 said their results suggested that if birds were able to view the lizards from the ground , however , they would find them easy to spot , while lizards would struggle to find potential mates if they viewed from above			1
this ability to direct certain colours of light in specific directions is what has allowed the lizards to develop such bright skin for attracting partners without being targetted by predators			1
dr @entity89 said the iridescence is thought to be caused by pigments that are produced in the skin rather than the structure of the scales themselves			2
although the lizard seems to stand out against the rocks shrubs of its normal habitat in the mountains of northern @entity18 and @entity248 , to birds that see more in the ultraviolet spectrum , they become hard to spot this could allow scientists to develop new types of camouflage for the military if it can be adapted			1
dr @entity89 said : ' based on the data available , skin structures responsible for structural colours do n’t change seasonally			0
' these colours are developed during lizard development and often appear at maturity and may be modified with growth also in adults			0
' probably , the seasonal changes in this kind of colours is caused by the pigment components that interact with structures to generate animal structural colours			0
' dr @entity89 said that their findings could also provide new ways of looking at iridescence in other species such as butterflies , snakes , birds and fish			0
he said : ' assuming that the iridescence of blue heads is selected positively by the interaction of natural selection and sexual selection , we can hypothesize that the fact that birds can see the uv spectrum is one of the causes that favour iridescence			2
' we think that this phenomenon may be more widely distributed			0
for instance , more insects and birds show iridescent colours , often with more striking changes in colour appearance depending on the angle of vision than lizard blue heads			2

iberian emerald lizard is almost invisible to birds when viewed from above
the reptile 's bright blue and green body is easy to spot from ground level
@entity21 and @entity18 biologists found the lizards ' skin is iridescent
lizards reflect less blue and ultraviolet light *vertically* than horizontally
birds use uv light to see and struggle to see lizards against background
@entity323 is caused by pigments in the lizards ' skin and could help scientists develop new types of camouflage for clothing and *vehicles*
