the @entity1 spacecraft has returned yet another series of stunning animations of @entity4 as its moves ever closer to the dwarf planet			1
at a resolution of 8.5 miles ( 14km ) per pixel , the pictures represent the sharpest images to date of the icy world , which @entity1 is due to arrive at on march 6			1
when it does , it will become the first human - made probe to visit the ' @entity18 ' planet - and scientists hope it will uncover the secrets behind its mysterious white spot			1
' we know so little about our vast solar system , but thanks to economical missions like @entity1 , those mysteries are being solved , ' said @entity44 , @entity45 at @entity46			0
the new @entity1 images come on the heels of initial navigation images taken in january that reveal an ' alien ' white spot on the dwarf planet and the suggestion of craters			1
while @entity46 has not provided an explanation , scientists suggest it may be a frozen pool of ice at the bottom of a crater that reflects light			0
we can confirm that it is something on @entity4 that reflects more sunlight , but what that is remains a mystery , ' @entity66 , mission director and chief engineer for the @entity1 , told @entity68 over the next weeks , @entity1 will provide increasingly sharper images of the icy world			1
' we know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet @entity4			1
' now , @entity1 is ready to change that , ' said @entity66 , @entity1 's chief engineer and mission director , based at @entity46 's @entity76 in @entity77			0
at 8.5 miles ( 14km ) per pixel , the pictures represent the sharpest images to date of the icy world , which @entity1 is due to arrive at on march 6 at 43 pixels wide , these older images taken in january are more than 30 per cent higher in resolution than those taken by @entity46 's @entity85 in 2003 and 2004 at a distance of over 150 million miles the ' alien ' mark can be clearly seen in the latest images the icy world as the @entity1 hurtles its way towards a rendezvous on march 6 on the left is a processed image , taken january 13			1
it hints at craters on the surface of @entity4			2
@entity1 's framing camera took this image at 238,000 miles ( 383,000km ) from @entity4			1
on the right , is a zoomed - in raw image @entity4 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			2
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb ( 6kg ) per second			2
' now , finally , we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious , alien world , ' @entity1 mission director and chief engineer @entity66 , of @entity46 's @entity76 in @entity105 , @entity77 said			0
' soon it will reveal myriad secrets @entity4 has held since the dawn of the solar system			0
' observations by the @entity116 's @entity115 suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes			0
@entity4 orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between @entity121 and @entity122 and is very similar to @entity122 's @entity123 and @entity125 's @entity124 - both considered potential sources for harbouring life			1
@entity4 is the bright spot in the centre of the image			0
because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background , the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible			2
the long exposure made @entity4 appear overexposed , and exaggerated its size a cropped , magnified view of @entity4 appears in the inset image at lower left @entity1 will be captured into @entity4 ' orbit in march , marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity4 is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			1
@entity4 is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '			1
scientists think @entity4 may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere			0
it lies less than three times as far as @entity162 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
@entity46 's @entity1 has been making its way to @entity4 from the asteroid @entity169 since september 2012			1
it is due to land next year			0
there is high interest in the mission because @entity4 is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice , water , and minerals			0
dr @entity180 , of the @entity116 's lab in @entity182 in @entity183 said : ' although ground and space - based observations may further map the behaviour of @entity4 over its orbit the @entity1 spacecraft mission arriving to orbit @entity4 in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long - term follow - up on the water outgassing behaviour of @entity4			1
' the presence and abundance of water in bodies like @entity4 could have relevance for the origin of life on @entity162 and the large - scale migration of planets such as @entity122			2
one scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early @entity162 and @entity209 - delivering organic molecules and water to @entity162			0
@entity4 is twice the size of @entity125 's geyser - spouting moon @entity212 which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface			2
it lies less than three times as far as @entity162 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
since launching in 2007 , @entity1 has already visited @entity169 , a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles ( 168 million km ) away from @entity4			2
the distance between @entity169 and @entity4 is greater than the distance between the @entity162 and the sun. during its 14 months in orbit around @entity169 , the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights , including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history			1
@entity169 and @entity4 are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt			0
@entity4 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			0
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface			2

the @entity4 asteroid orbits the sun between @entity121 and @entity122 , and may have water gushing from its surface
latest images have a resolution of 8.5 miles ( 14km ) per pixel and were taken with distance of 90,000 miles
@entity1 is currently travelling to meet @entity4 in march where it will *attempt* to understand its geological history
navigation images taken january 13 reveal an ' alien ' white spot on the dwarf planet and suggestion of craters
