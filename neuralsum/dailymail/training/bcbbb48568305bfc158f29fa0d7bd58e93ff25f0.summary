by @entity0 ' master ' : @entity2 claims that he is the best counterfeiter working globally today a @entity5 counterfeiter who made up to $ 250million in fake @entity8 cash has been released from jail after only a month and a half behind bars and a minimal fine			1
@entity2 has delved into the details of his operation with 20/20 and told how the process was startlingly easy			2
' it was like , screw you , ' @entity16 said of his message to the @entity8 government			0
the paper was made in @entity23 and @entity24 mills that made the specific cotton and linen blend used in the @entity8 currency under the guise of being for a different - legal - operation			2
' you have to start with that ... it ’s got this crisp feel			0
if you do n’t have that you ’ll have nothing , ' @entity16 told @entity35 's @entity34			0
from there , he sourced the ink and the detailed security features added to each bill in @entity40 and had the different parts shipped to a @entity5 town outside @entity43			1
the $ 20 bill is thought of by counterfeiters as one of the easiest to emulate because it was last updated in 2003 and all of the parts of the creation process can be sourced online			2
caught : investigators were tracking his fake $ 20 bills for four years before he finally ended up behind bars , briefly a skilled printer helped him put ink to paper and from there , he claims to have sold the batches of fake bills in bulk			1
the criminal groups that he sold the counterfeit bills to made out well , getting $ 1million in fake bills for $ 300,000			0
@entity16 's operation has been going on for years and @entity35 reports that the first one of his counterfeit bills was spotted in @entity68 in 2010			1
from there , the @entity70 's @entity69 and the @entity71 worked together to track him and his bills			2
sourced online : he arranged to have the paper necessary - with the correct mix of linen and cotton - made at a mill in @entity24 he eventually got a lawyer and struck a deal with investigators that led to a $ 1,500 fine in @entity5 dollars and spent just six weeks in jail before being released in late march			1
the @entity71 says that @entity5 officials led the investigation and @entity16 is not currently wanted in the @entity8 so he will not be extradited			1
one factor that still has investigators worried is that @entity16 may be taking credit for leading the operation - and calling himself the best counterfeiter currently working today - in order to cover for other criminals who actually led the operation			0
on top of that , he has avoided answering whether or not he has hidden more stacks of bills			0
' it takes a network of people to pass all these bills , it ’s a huge quantity so you can ‘ t just trust a couple of people , ' @entity103 investigator @entity102 said			0

@entity2 's first counterfeit @entity8 $ 20 bills were first spotted in @entity68 in 2010
he had the specially developed paper printed at a mill in @entity24 and the ink shipped to his home base in @entity5 from @entity40
struck a deal with @entity5 authorities and the @entity71 so that he was only jailed for six weeks and paid a $ 1,500 @entity5 fine
will not be extradited and is no *longer* wanted in the @entity8
has not told authorities if he has any extra stacks of bills hidden
