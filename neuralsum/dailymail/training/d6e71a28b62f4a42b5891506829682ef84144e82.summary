by @entity0 a council has spent £ 42,000 of taxpayers ' money on shuttling workers to a call centre 524ft away in taxis			1
@entity7 collects and drops off dozens of customer service workers for the 160m journey across the @entity10			1
the trips might be tiny , but they cost the taxpayer £ 7,000 a year and have run for six years			1
map but the @entity15 - led council has defended its decision to drop workers off , claiming that they had a ' duty of care ' to staff , who had raised concerns about walking to work in the dark			1
@entity23 , head of the customer service centre , said : ' during a staff survey a few years ago , safety concerns were raised by those who walk to and from @entity28 and the @entity30 area during the winter months			1
' the majority of staff are female and , as a responsible employer , the council agreed to provide transport from november until march at the beginning and end of the day			2
' currently the service is mainly used by staff from our @entity38 and other colleagues within @entity28			1
the trips might be tiny , but they cost the taxpayer £ 7,000 a year and have run for six years ' the road is due to be upgraded this year , which will provide a safer walking route for our staff , and remove the need for transport in future years			1
' she said there had been some incidents which involved the police being called , the @entity53 reported , but officers told @entity55 that there had been no reports of attacks or serious crime			2
the service runs between 8am and 9.30am and 3.30pm until 6pm from november until march			1
a @entity7 spokesman said : ' @entity62 , campaign director for the @entity63 , told both @entity55 and the @entity53 : ' it seems an utterly absurd waste of taxpayers ' money to provide cabs for a hundred metre journey			2
' employers should encourage staff to take responsibility for their safety			2
' it 's difficult to imagine that any other employer not funded by taxpayers would think cabs are an appropriate solution to such a short distance			2
' safety concerns were raised by those who walk to and from @entity28 and the @entity30 area during the winter months , the council said @entity7 has been criticised before about how they spend taxpayers ' money			0
it spent money paying famous musicians their royalties so that they could use their songs as ' hold music ' while residents waited for their calls to be answered			0
the authority discovered more modern easy - listening chart songs - such as @entity94 and @entity95 - dramatically reduced the number of people hanging up			0
@entity7 said the number of people who hang up while on hold has more than halved since piping commercial tracks down the telephone to those in the queue			0
@entity104 is one of a handful of authorities to have ditched traditional hold music in favour of easy - listening chart songs , which require royalty payments to the @entity112 ( @entity112 )			0
councillor @entity113 , executive member for highways at @entity7 , said : ' people can be kept waiting for a few minutes at peak times so we use commercial songs for our on - hold music			0
quite frankly , our callers love it			0
' it costs just £ 175 per year and since we introduced it , we have reduced our abandoned call rate by half - from 4,000 calls per month to just 1,600			1
' i would , however , like to take this opportunity to apologise for our use of the @entity131 ’s @entity130			0
i accept this was a deplorable lapse in judgement and we deserve all the criticism we get			0
' in our defence , it was either that or @entity140 ’s @entity139			0
