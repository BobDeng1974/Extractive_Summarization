many of us take driving directions for granted , but for areas with strict web controls , such as @entity6 , it 's a luxury			1
@entity7 has managed to bypass a number of these restrictions by using data supplied by users of its @entity13 service to plot roads , subways , and parks in the eastern region			1
and now it has built on this information by adding satellite navigation across the country			0
@entity7 began adding roads , subway stations and parks to the @entity6 region of its @entity13 service in january 2013			1
these additions were made using submissions from worldwide @entity13 users			2
using this data , @entity7 has now added step - by - step driving directions , pictured , along the roads that have been mapped in 2012 , @entity7 announced it was going to start adding detailed mapping information in areas ‘ that traditionally have been mostly blank ’ - including @entity6			1
to build this map , a community of so - called citizen cartographers added road names and points of interesting to the @entity38 tool			0
the detailed site launched on 28 january 2013			0
building on this data , @entity7 now plots driving directions across the country - but only on roads that have been mapped			1
@entity7 did not comment on the recent transport changes , but linked to its original blog post from 2013 that said : ‘ from this point forward , any further approved updates to the @entity6 maps in @entity38 will also appear on @entity13			1
’ @entity6 's leader @entity49 imposes strict controls on internet use and how many people can buy cars , for example			1
earlier this week , reports claimed the region has just 5,500 websites and emails and texts are closely monitored			0

‘ from this point forward , any further approved updates to the @entity6 maps in @entity38 will also appear on @entity13			0
’ the directions , which began rolling out in june last year , are available on desktop , as well as the @entity83 and @entity85 app versions of the service			0
the directions , which began rolling out in june last year , are available on desktop , as well as the @entity83 and @entity85 app versions , pictured left , of the service			0
like in other regions , these directions feature step - by - step instructions , traffic details , where possible , mileage and travel time , pictured right asking for routes across the borders into @entity98 and @entity99 produces a message saying @entity7 has been unable to calculate directions , pictured			1
although @entity13 shows railway and subway lines in @entity6 , it still does n't show timetable information like in other regions , these directions feature step - by - step instructions , traffic details , where possible , mileage and travel time			2
but asking for routes to both @entity111 and @entity112 produces a message saying @entity7 has been unable to calculate directions			2
although @entity13 shows railway and subway lines , it still does n’t show timetable information as seen in other regions			0
this may be because regulations in @entity98 restrict certain details from being released			0
according to @entity122 , this could be due to the fact @entity7 has offices in @entity111 and therefore is bound by the country ’s laws - which it is n't in @entity6			2
@entity6 , under the leadership of @entity49 , pictured , imposes strict controls on internet use and how many people can buy cars , for example			1
earlier this week , reports claimed the region has just 5,500 websites and emails and texts are closely monitored			0

@entity6 's leader @entity49 imposes strict controls on web use
@entity7 began adding roads , subway stations and parks in 2012
these additions were made using submissions from worldwide maps users
using this data , @entity7 has now added driving directions for the region
but crossing the border into @entity98 or @entity99 produces an error
some public transport details are also still missing from the service
