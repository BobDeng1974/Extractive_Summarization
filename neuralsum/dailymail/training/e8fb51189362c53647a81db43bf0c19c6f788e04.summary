to borrow the words of @entity2 , this match was like a ‘ poker game ’ for @entity4			1
the @entity6 coach had in effect held a gun to his own head , promising to resign after just 72 days at the helm if his team failed to beat @entity12 in this @entity14 qualifier			1
but @entity4 knew he had a strong hand and in @entity2 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , four genuine aces			1
@entity17 grabbed a double to ensure @entity6 ran out comfortable winners against @entity12 @entity6 captain @entity2 opened the scoring in the sixth minute by leaping above @entity12 's defence to nod home the @entity26 man beat @entity12 's @entity27 to the ball to score past goalkeeper @entity29 @entity30 jumps in the air after putting @entity4 's side in the lead against @entity12 at the @entity34 @entity6 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity35 6 ; @entity37 der @entity36 7 , @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 7 , @entity40 7 ; @entity41 7.5 ( @entity42 69 ) , @entity43 4 ( @entity44 20 , 7 ) , @entity18 7 ; @entity17 8.5 , @entity19 7.5 , @entity30 ( c ) 7.5 ( wijnaldum 79 ) substitutes not used : @entity45 ( gk ) ; @entity46 ( gk ) ; @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 scorers : @entity55 6 ; @entity17 35 , 82 ; @entity19 42 , 89 ; @entity39 78 booked : @entity38 @entity12 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity29 4 ; @entity27 4 , @entity57 5 , @entity56 ( c ) 5 , kurakins 4 ; @entity58 5 ( @entity59 46 , 5 ) , zjuzins 5 ( @entity60 54 , 5 ) , @entity61 5 , @entity62 5 ; @entity63 6 ; @entity62 5 ( @entity64 70 ) substitutes not used : @entity65 ( gk ) , @entity66 ( gk ) ; @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 booked : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity59 referee : @entity77 ( @entity78 ) @entity79 : @entity17 the quartet ran amok at the @entity34 as @entity6 put their recent troubles to one side with a comfortable win - but it did come at a price for @entity26			1
@entity86 , the midfielder who has performed so consistently well for them this season , hobbled off injured after 20 minutes after colliding with @entity62 and taking a blow to the knee			1
he is now a doubt for saturday ’s trip to @entity93 as @entity95 ’s injury nightmare grows ever worse			2
it will be a threadbare @entity26 side that lines up at the @entity97 , with @entity86 ’s injury adding to a casualty list that already includes @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			2
his withdrawal did n’t affect @entity6 too badly , however			0
at least @entity30 ’s early header gave @entity107 something to smile about and they asserted a clear dominance over their visitors with goals from @entity17 - a 25 - yard worldie - and @entity19 before the break			1
@entity39 turned in a @entity30 flick - on 12 minutes from time to add some gloss to the scoreline , @entity17 powered in a fifth and @entity19 drilled home no 6 in the final minute			1
more pertinently , this second win in qualifying @entity121 lifts the pressure on @entity4 , who was on the brink after four defeats in his first five matches since succeeding @entity107 after the @entity127			2
the former @entity129 boss can breathe easy , at least until they play @entity131 at the end of march			0
@entity4 shuffled his pack and brought the game - winning cards to the fore			0
@entity30 , who sat out wednesday ’s match with @entity138 , tucked in behind @entity19 with @entity17 and @entity41 stationed either side of him			1
@entity86 started as a defensive shield , asked to curb his natural attacking instincts			0
neither the dismal recent form - nor the lousy @entity34 weather - failed to dampen the spirit of the @entity6 fans , who created a right din ahead of kick - off as techno tunes pumped out of the @entity149 system and into the enclosed @entity150			2
the players responded , attacking with a high tempo from the first whistle			0
on two minutes , @entity30 controlled the ball inside the box and nudged it wide to @entity41 , who curled his shot against the upright			0
moments later and they had the lead , settling the nerves of @entity4 and the entire stadium			0
@entity17 , as he would be allowed to all evening , found space down the left and placed his cross right on @entity30 ’s head for the most straightforward of finishes			0
in contrast to his patchy recent form for @entity26 , this was @entity30 ’s 18th goal in 25 national team appearances and his 49th in orange colours overall			0
feeling more relaxed , @entity6 continued to pour forward at will			0
@entity17 again collected possession in the right - hand channel , cut inside two defenders , and fired into the side - netting			2
@entity18 celebrates with @entity6 team - mate @entity30 after the @entity26 forward opens the scoring @entity29 failed to get anywhere near @entity30 's header in the sixth minute of the qualifier at the @entity34 @entity29 lays on the ground after seeing @entity17 's shot fly past him and into the back of the net former @entity187 goalkeeper @entity29 dives to his left but is unable to stop @entity17 's shot from nestling in the back of the net @entity190 striker @entity19 poked home from close range to score @entity6 's third goal of the evening @entity41 congratulates international team - mate @entity19 after the striker netted @entity6 's third on the quarter - hour , @entity30 touched on to @entity19 - the forward pair combining well as @entity4 had hoped - and the ball wormed its way to @entity41 , whose low drive was saved by former @entity187 keeper @entity29			1
there was a moment of alarm when @entity58 found the unmarked @entity63 inside the area , but the @entity12 headed over when well - placed			0
the injury to @entity86 killed @entity6 ’s momentum and their chances dried up until the final 10 minutes of the half			1
@entity18 , whose 74 successful passes in the opening period eclipsed the 56 of the entire @entity12 team , found @entity30 pulling away at the back post but his header was easily saved			2
it took a moment of wonder from @entity17 to awaken the game from its slumber			0
collecting the ball wide right , he cut inside and curled the ball left - footed and into the top corner from 25 yards			0
@entity29 gawped at it as it flew past him , unable to influence the perfect trajectory achieved by the @entity226 man ’s boot			0
and three minutes from the break , @entity4 could truly rest easy when @entity19 ghosted in front of his marker and stuck out a foot to turn @entity41 ’s low cross past @entity29			1
it was a fitting reflection of @entity234 dominance			0
it took @entity6 a good 10 minutes to get back into their stride after half - time , with @entity30 again testing @entity29 with a header from @entity17 ’s flighted free - kick			1
and the winger curled his next set - piece against the post a couple of minutes later as @entity6 threatened a fourth , while a shot from an impossibly tight angle following another marauding run was somehow kept out by the goalkeeper			1
it was , at times , the @entity17 show and after he ’d seen another couple of efforts blocked , his 78th - minute corner was flicked on by @entity30 at the near post and turned in by former @entity129 man @entity39 for 4 - 0			1
and as if he had n’t done enough to earn the man of the match accolade , @entity17 slammed home no 5 as well			0
@entity19 rounded off the rout with a neat spin inside the box and a low finish under the keeper			2
former @entity129 defender @entity39 ( right ) also managed to get his name on the scoresheet @entity19 grabbed his second goal of the night in the 89th minute to complete the scoring for @entity6 @entity26 's @entity86 was helped off the field by a member of @entity6 's medical team during the @entity269 qualifier @entity6 utility man @entity43 went down in agony after a collision with @entity62 during the first half referee @entity77 shows @entity12 's @entity59 a yellow card during the @entity269 qualifier in @entity34 @entity4 's side had lost four of their first five games since he replaced @entity26 boss @entity95 after the @entity279 @entity6 boss @entity4 and his coaching staff including @entity281 and @entity282 ( far left ) will be pleased with their side 's result			1

@entity4 threatened to quit his role as manager if @entity6 failed to beat @entity12
@entity2 , @entity17 and @entity19 got on the scoresheet to ensure @entity4 stays in his post
former @entity129 defender @entity39 scored @entity6 's fourth before @entity17 and @entity19 completed rout
@entity4 had seen his side lose four of their first five games since taking over from @entity95 before win
@entity86 limped off after damaging his knee following collision with @entity62
