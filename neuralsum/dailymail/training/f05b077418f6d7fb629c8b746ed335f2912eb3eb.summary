by @entity0 published : 02:22 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 29 november 2013 @entity3 prices surged by 6.5 per cent year - on - year in november , marking the fastest annual increase seen in more than three years , @entity1 has reported			1
prices have been rising every month for the last year and the latest monthly increase of 0.6 per cent took average @entity8 house values to £ 174,566			1
the annual increase is the strongest seen since july 2010 , but @entity1 said that despite the strong pick - up in the housing market , prices are still around 6 per cent below an all - time high recorded in 2007			1
boom time : house prices rose 6.5 per cent year - on - year in november , marking the fastest annual increase seen in more than three years on the up : prices have been rising every month for the last year and the latest monthly increase of 0.6 per cent took average @entity8 house values to £ 174,566 , but that is still around 6 % lower than the all - time high in 2007 yesterday , the @entity19 took the first step in putting the brakes on the surging property market as it scrapped an initiative that has had a significant part to play in encouraging mortgage lending			1
governor @entity27 said the @entity28 ( @entity30 ) stimulus was no longer needed amid rising house prices , and it would instead be focused on helping small business borrowing , which remains muted			2
@entity28 has offered lenders access to cheap finance on condition that they pass on the benefits to borrowers , and experts yesterday said that the @entity19 's move could spell the ' beginning of the end ' for ultra-cheap mortgage deals			2
fears of a looming property bubble have been growing in recent months amid a string of reports suggesting demand in the housing market far outstrips the growth in the supply of homes			0
scaling back : @entity19 governor @entity27 ( pictured ) said the funding for lending scheme stimulus was no longer needed due to rising house prices @entity54 in particular has seen strong demand this year , and @entity57 figures released yesterday showed that house prices in @entity54 were up by 8.7 per cent year - on - year in october			1
but the market remains patchy and prices in the @entity61 have dropped by 3.1 per cent year - on - year , the @entity57 figures showed			1
the government 's new help to buy scheme , which offers state - backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent was launched in october			2
this is expected to inject further activity into the market among credit - worthy buyers who have particularly struggled to get on the housing ladder or move up it since the financial crisis struck because they have a lack of upfront funds			0
lenders representing around two - thirds of the mortgage market have committed to coming on board the scheme and there are also signs of competition increasing to attract low - deposit borrowers from lenders which are outside the help to buy scheme			2
huge divide : in contrast to rising values in @entity54 , much of the rest of the country has seen scant growth residential property prices in the capital continue to outpace the national average @entity98 , @entity1 's chief economist , said that a large part of the uplift in the housing market is also down to improvements in the labour market and the brighter economic outlook , which has helped to bolster sentiment amongst potential buyers			1
he also highlighted the impact that low mortgage rates have had on borrowers ' costs			0
mr @entity98 said : ' mortgage rates have declined significantly from the already low levels prevailing last year			0
' for example , @entity19 data indicates that the interest rate on two - year fixed - rate mortgages for those with a 10 per cent deposit has fallen from 5.6 per cent to 4.4 per cent over the past 12 months			1
' for a buyer purchasing the typical @entity8 home over 25 years , this equates to a reduction in monthly payments of around £ 110 ( £ 1,320 per year ) at the current average house price			1
' boom : but the @entity19 has been criticised for sending out ' mixed messages ' people are taking out mortgages at the fastest rate since before the financial crash , according to the @entity19			1
october saw 67,701 home mortgages approved - the most in any month since february 2008			2
the deals , worth £ 10.5 billion , have led to fears of a new property bubble			0
another 35,261 remortgaging deals worth £ 5.3 billion were approved in october , above the average of 33,800			0
to combat the rise the bank is changing the terms on one of its main credit schemes , @entity28 , to focus more on helping small businesses			0
@entity142 , a property analyst at @entity143 , criticised the @entity19 for sending out mixed messages by trying to cool the market just as help to buy expands			0
' there have been some tortuous attempts to explain how all these policies fit together , but the end result is a bit of a mess , ' he said			0
' that could in itself serve to confuse potential buyers , and that may hold them back from jumping into the housing market			0
' however , the bank 's figures also showed people are more cautious about personal debt in the run - up to @entity162			0
consumer credit grew by £ 457 million in october , halving from a £ 1.1 billion rise the previous month			0
the rise in personal loans and overdrafts of £ 219 million was also a sharp fall from september 's five - and - a - half year high of £ 935 million .			1
