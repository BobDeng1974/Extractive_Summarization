a family who moved home so they could send their son to a primary school found they were still outside the catchment area - and now face 12 bus journeys a day to take him elsewhere			1
@entity8 , 26 , and @entity9 , 33 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , uprooted so five - year - old @entity12 could go to the same school where he attended nursery			1
but the family soon found out that they were still outside the catchment area - by just a dozen houses - and were refused a place after a council allocated them a school further away			1
bus stop : @entity24 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , is pictured with her five - year - old son @entity12			2
the boy 's father faces 12 bus journeys to take @entity28 and his brother @entity29 to school because of the decision , mr @entity9 will now have to make 12 bus journeys a day - two buses in each direction , six times - to get both @entity28 and his younger brother to the correct school and back			1
the family moved in may last year to ensure that @entity12 was able to go straight from nursery with his friends to @entity41 in the @entity43 area of the town			1
but @entity12 has been home - schooled since september while his parents battle to get him into the school where he went to nursery			1
his brother @entity29 , three , currently attends the nursery where his mother and her siblings also went to school			0
but the couple have lost an appeal for @entity28 to attend - as the school is said to be full			1
however , the family home is about half a mile from @entity58 - while @entity59 , which has been offered by @entity60 , is around 1.5 miles away			1
and if @entity28 ends up having to attend @entity59 , the family will also move @entity29 there , resulting in the 12 bus journeys for mr @entity9 each day			2
' he 's bored ' : @entity12 's parents moved house so he could go to the same school where he attended nursery - but the family soon found out that they were still outside the catchment area map : as a consequence of the council 's decision , mr @entity9 will now have to make 12 bus journeys a day across @entity10 in order to get both @entity28 and his younger brother to the correct school and back @entity29 , three , currently attends nursery at @entity41 , which is half a mile from the family home			1
@entity12 , five , is currently home - schooled			1
if @entity28 ends up going @entity59 , which has been offered by @entity60 , the family will also move @entity29 to the nursery there			2
two buses are required to make it from the family home to @entity59			0
and because @entity29 will take part in half - day nursery , the father would have to take him into school separately to @entity28			1
this would therefore result in : @entity12 was first on the list for a place at @entity58 but the family have heard that another child has moved into the catchment area and leapfrogged them despite living further away from the school			1
mother - of - two mrs @entity24 , a senior healthcare support worker , said : ‘ if @entity28 got in then there would be more chance that @entity29 would get in because he would have a sibling there			2
‘ we 've all got links to the school and we still think it is a really good school			0
i would say it is a slim to none chance that he will get in now that he has dropped down to second place on the list			0
‘ another child has moved in to the catchment area but they are further away from the school than us			1
the road opposite us are in the catchment area and if we had moved into the end of our road we would have been fine			1
‘ the council allocated him @entity122 but it is much further from us then @entity58 is			1
when we moved we just assumed it was ok because it is so close to the school			0
‘ it 's hard to get hold of a map of the catchment areas and the first time we saw one was when i registered him for the reception			0
he was already in the nursery and we just assumed he would move up			0
‘ the woman at the school showed me a map and i thought it wo n't make much difference but we got a letter through from the council saying he had been allocated @entity122			2
mummy : mrs @entity24 said the family are ' devastated ' at not being able to get @entity28 into their preferred school where @entity12 's parents want him to go : the family moved to ensure @entity12 was able to go straight from nursery with his friends to @entity150 @entity151 ( pictured ) in @entity43 , @entity10 ‘ the school said “ oo you 're just outside ” and i never thought it would n't make a difference			1
if you look at the map it 's such a small difference you might not even see it			0
the line on the map just skips our house			0
’ ' devastated ' : mrs @entity24 , pictured with @entity28 , said the family spent £ 1,000 to move closer to the school the family spent £ 1,000 to move closer to the school and are not planning to move again as they do not believe it will guarantee their children a place			2
mrs @entity24 said : ' we are devastated			0
we have considered moving again to be inside the catchment area but we have worked out it would cost us £ 1,380 and that would only move him up to first , not guarantee a place			1
’ if the family accepted the council 's offer , they would also put @entity29 in the @entity181 , which would involve a total of 12 buses a day for the boys ' self - employed car valeter father , mr @entity9			2
there is a school bus but @entity12 is said to be afraid to travel alone			2
mrs @entity24 said : ‘ i ca n't drop @entity12 off at school due to my working hours and his father does n't drive , so it would mean 12 buses a day for @entity9 including half - day nursery for @entity29			1
‘ @entity28 has a phobia , he wo n't go alone on the school bus , and he does n't adjust very well to change			2
i explained all this at the appeal but they did n't seem interested			0
‘ he 's getting bored of being home schooled and he just wants to see his friends			0
i 'm trying to keep him interested and keep him in a routine but it would be better if he was in a school			0
‘ it did start off very well but now we are very concerned as @entity28 seems bored , and his behaviour has drastically deteriorated			0
we are constantly trying to keep him cheerful , but it is stressful			0
’ the appeal officers also suggested @entity12 could attend @entity207 in the @entity209 area of @entity10 , despite being told it was full by the @entity212 officer present			2
further distance : the family home is about half a mile from @entity215 - and @entity59 ( pictured ) , which has been offered by @entity60 , is around 1.5 miles away @entity216 , the council 's assistant director for learning and skills , said : ‘ children are more likely to be allocated to a particular school if they live within the catchment area			1
‘ all reception places at @entity58 were already full			0
places were allocated based on the school 's oversubscription criteria and we were unable to allocate any more - an independent appeals panel has supported that decision			0
‘ our advice to parents is always to state more than one preference when applying for a school place			0
when an application only names one preferred school , and when that school is full , parents can only be offered a place at the nearest available school			0
‘ if a family also name a school that is within their catchment area , this can help in securing a place nearer to home			1
whilst we sympathise with any family in this situation , it does highlight the important of naming more than one school preference			0

parents moved house so @entity12 could go to same school as nursery
but found out they were still outside catchment area - by 12 houses
refused place after council allocated them a school 1.5 miles away
@entity28 is being home - schooled while parents battle to change school
