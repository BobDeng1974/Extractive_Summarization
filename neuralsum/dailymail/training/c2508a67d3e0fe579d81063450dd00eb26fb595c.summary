@entity1 's junketing has pumped more than 24 tons of carbon into the atmosphere lord @entity1 ’s return to frontline politics as @entity7 ’s ‘ climate change adviser ’ has already hit turbulence – after research uncovered the size of the junketing peer ’s own carbon footprint			1
the former deputy prime minister has enjoyed an astonishing 23 foreign trips in the course of this @entity16 , amassing more than 181,000 air miles and depositing an estimated 24 tons of carbon into the atmosphere			0
lord @entity1 , 76 , says his new role will involve helping a future @entity23 government broker international agreements on reducing emissions , which campaigners claim are pushing up global temperatures			1
@entity27 will be one of the key areas for discussion : activists have called for higher taxes on air travel after calculating that environmental pollution from planes has increased by more than 80 per cent since 1990			0
however , this has not deterred @entity1 from taking enough junkets since 2010 to fly seven times around the globe			2
the @entity40 has established that since joining the @entity42 in july 2010 , he has flown – at someone else ’s expense – to @entity45 ( seven times ) , @entity47 ( four times ) and @entity49 ( twice ) , as well as @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
according to his declarations in the @entity42 ’ @entity59 , he has also visited @entity60 twice , although it is unclear whether he flew or took the more environmentally friendly @entity62			2
six of the trips were funded by @entity65 , an organisation which gathers parliamentarians from different countries together to discuss climate change issues			0
the bills for all his other junkets were either met by quangos , private companies or the @entity74			0
lord @entity1 , who served as the @entity76 ’s lead negotiator at the @entity78 talks which led to the first global agreement on cutting carbon emissions in 1997 , said he was taking the new frontbench role under mr @entity7 ‘ to raise ambition on this crucial issue and … to help the man i hope will be the next prime minister so that together we can help the next generation ’			1
but critics claimed the job was just an excuse to bring @entity1 back in order to beef up @entity23 ’s media performances in the run - up to the election			2
it was also seen as an attempt to stop the haemorrhage of both working class votes to @entity99 , and environmentalist votes to the @entity101			0
mr @entity7 said that he had given @entity1 the job because he ‘ knows how to knock heads together ’			1
lord @entity1 first developed a reputation for ‘ junketing ’ during the 13 years he spent as @entity106 ’s deputy			1
lord @entity1 , left , has jetted around the world to discuss and highlight the issue of climate change @entity7 is believed to have given @entity1 , pictured , a job to secure working - class votes shortly before leaving the government in 2007 , he embarked on a seven - day ‘ farewell tour ’ of @entity49 and the @entity114 which was estimated to have cost taxpayers as much as £ 50,000			1
@entity1 and his eight - strong team stayed in luxury hotels in @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 as part of a visit to highlight his ‘ interest in urban planning and the end of slavery ’			2
last night , @entity129 mp @entity128 said : ‘ it is not surprising that “ @entity134 ” @entity1 is completely hypocritical on climate change – saying that he wants to save the planet while jetting off to far - flung parts of the globe			0
‘ the surprising thing is that @entity7 thinks hard - working taxpayers should have to pay @entity1 ’s bills again			0
‘ it would be a disaster if the @entity1 global vanity tour was allowed to obscure the important task of tackling climate change			0
’ lord @entity1 did not respond to a request for comment .			1
