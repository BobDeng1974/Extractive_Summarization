an emotional @entity1 team will decide on thursday whether to replace the stricken @entity2 for this weekend ’s @entity4 @entity3 or leave his car empty as a mark of respect			1
with @entity2 ’s condition remaining critical but stable after his horrific crash at last sunday ’s race in @entity13 , a sense of normality has yet to return to the @entity15 - based team			1
@entity1 ’s reserve driver , @entity16 , travelled to @entity17 on wednesday night and could make his @entity19 race debut in @entity2 ’s place			1
@entity2 's name takes place on his side of the @entity1 garage ahead of the @entity4 @entity3 @entity2 is in a stable but critical condition in intensive care at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity13 @entity2 's absence from the @entity4 @entity3 means @entity1 could field just one car with @entity31 @entity1 reserve driver @entity16 ( left ) could partner @entity31 at the @entity4 @entity3 @entity2 is fighting for his life after sustaining brain injuries after his crash with the tractor the 23 - year - old , who has driven in practice for @entity38 , has a superlicence that would allow him to slot straight in but some within the team would prefer they race only one car , that of @entity15 ’s @entity31			1
whether the rules allow that is unclear			0
there is also the question of how their owner , @entity47 , views the situation going into the first @entity19 race to be staged in @entity4			2
the race is likely to see the grand prix community united in sympathy			0
@entity55 , who schooled @entity2 - he remains on their young driver programme - will carry the words ‘ @entity59 ’ on their car			2
the @entity61 embarrassingly included @entity62 , the @entity1 team principal , on their press conference list even though he is still in @entity13 at @entity2 ’s bedside			0
@entity65 , who won in @entity13 to extend his championship lead over @entity67 to 10 points , said on wednesday : ‘ i was pleased to have finally won at @entity69 , but as soon as we heard what happened to @entity73 it suddenly did n’t seem relevant anymore			0
my thoughts and prayers are with him and his family			0

@entity2 suffered horror *110mph* smash at @entity90 @entity3
@entity93 's family confirmed he suffered a *diffuse* *axonal* injury ( @entity95 )
the *25* - year - old driver has been in intensive care since sunday
@entity19 *resumes* in @entity17 for inaugural @entity4 @entity3 this weekend
@entity1 must decide whether to race @entity16 in @entity2 's place
