for the first time @entity3 , 33 , appeared rattled as it emerged he left @entity46 on april 17 , 2002 , to fly to the @entity47 before entering @entity31 , posing as an aid worker			1

’ fearless : mass killer @entity3 , pictured with his lawyer @entity62 , told the court if he had feared death he would never have undertaken his ' operation ' fantasist : @entity3 , seen with lawyer @entity62 , was told by prosecutors that his @entity15 organisation did n't exist as he imagined hard job , but somebody has to do it : the stress of defending mass killer @entity3 shows on his face as he talks to a member of his team in the @entity46 court the court heard that @entity3 flew to @entity12 in late april 2002 where he attended a founding session of the @entity15 movement but he refused to give exact details of his co-conspirators			1
as images of @entity3 ’s 1,800 - page manifesto were flashed on to screens , the court heard that he met three other founding members of the @entity15 during his @entity12 visit			1

@entity87 watches : journalists work at the pressroom as defendant @entity8 mass killer @entity3 is led into court for the third day of his trial there were two @entity95 – including his ‘ mentor ’ , @entity6 – and a @entity98 nationalist at the founding meeting			2

what i will say is that @entity6 was responsible for calling the meeting			0
’ in his manifesto , @entity3 said : ‘ it was basically a long - term plan on how to seize power in @entity17			0
’ he told the court that the people he had met in @entity12 had ‘ great integrity ’ and how his codename of ‘ crusader ’ was taken from @entity114 , a 12th - century @entity115 king			2
asked if he felt he had met some ‘ like - minded friends ’ in @entity12 , he said : ‘ i felt i was a foot soldier associated with the others			0
