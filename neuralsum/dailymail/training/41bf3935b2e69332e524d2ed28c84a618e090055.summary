@entity1 serving on a @entity2 tasked with investigating the attack on the @entity5 consulate in @entity6 , @entity0 said today that key questions about the september 11 , 2012 assault had already been ' asked and answered ' and the committee was at risk of ' wasting taxpayers ' dollars			1
' they also argued that four months after it 's creation , the committee , which was allotted $ 3.3 million in funding for 2014 , has still yet to put forth clear objectives and a timeline to complete its investigation			1
' if we do not define the scope of the committee 's work in advance , this committee may end up being a committee in search of a mission , taking , on a life of it 's own and costing taxpayers millions , ' rep. @entity20 , a senior member of the @entity21 argued			1
' @entity44 ' left are reps			0
to his right are @entity45			0
@entity20 and rep. @entity49 the @entity39 on @entity6 , whose formation was announced in early may by @entity53 speaker @entity52 , will hold it 's first public hearing tomorrow morning			1
ahead of the hearing , the committee 's five @entity1 released a 133 - page compendium of @entity59 and a @entity6 on the @entity61 online database that lists frequently asked questions about the @entity6 attack , including , ' where was the president and what did he do on the night of the attacks ? ' rep. @entity35 , the ranking member on both the @entity6 committee and the @entity67 , said tuesday that @entity1 sifted through previous reports and hearings to create the database , and they hoped that their @entity72 colleagues would use it as a a research tool			1
' in this time of austerity , we do n't want to be wasting taxpayers ' dollars , ' @entity35 said , after the government has already conducted numerous reviews of the events that occurred leading up to and during the attack			1
' we need to make full use of the extensive investigations that have come before us already , ' he said			0
' we need to avoid duplication , conserve taxpayer dollars , and help improve the security of @entity5 facilities and personnel around the world			0
' already , seven congressional committees have held investigations into @entity6 and they have released nine reports , the @entity1 said			1
' we should not be spending the time that we have on this committee reviewing questions that have already been answered in numerous investigations and reports , ' rep. @entity49 , a freshman @entity49 on the committee , said today			1
' if we want to make sure that no @entity5 diplomat , no @entity5 life , no american service member is ever put in the same kind of jeopardy again , ' she continued , ' then we need to move beyond the questions that have already be answered			2
' tomorrow 's @entity6 committee hearing will supposedly do just that			2
the topic of the hearing is whether the @entity110 has implemented the 29 changes in policy recommended in an @entity114 report released several months after the @entity6 attack			2
the @entity114 encouraged @entity110 to increase the number of @entity5 forces at embassies in high - threat areas and rely less on local law enforcement for the protection of @entity5 personnel after it 's investigation into the @entity6 assault found that ' systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the @entity110 ' were responsible for security that was ' inadequate ' for the consulate in @entity6			1
' if we do not define the scope of the committee 's work in advance , this committee may end up being a committee in search of a mission , taking , on a life of it 's own and costing taxpayers millions , ' rep. @entity20 argued @entity53 @entity72 have criticized the @entity114 in the past for failing to interview then - secretary of state @entity145 for its investigation , as well as two deputy secretaries of state			1
a news report released on monday from @entity151 , an outlet ran by conservative think - tank @entity153 , claimed that @entity114 's investigation was further flawed because it did not have access to all of the documents relevant to it 's inquires			0
@entity158 , a former deputy assistant secretary for @entity160 affairs , claims he stumbled upon @entity110 employees , including one of his subordinates , hiding information that could be damaging to @entity165 or her allies			0
' she told me , " @entity171 , we are to go through these stacks and pull out anything that might put anybody in the [ @entity175 ] front office or the seventh floor in a bad light " , ' @entity158 's employee allegedly told him			0
@entity158 told @entity151 that those documents were set aside and put in basement room to be reviewed by @entity165 's staff			0
only the least damaging documents were provided to the @entity114 , he claimed			0
a @entity110 spokesman said on monday that @entity158 's accusations were ' totally without merit			0
' rep. @entity186 , a @entity72 on the @entity53 's @entity6 committee , told @entity151 that the committee would investigate the charge nonetheless			1
' i 'm 100 percent confident the @entity191 is going to dive deep on that issue , ' he said			0
@entity35 scoffed at the allegations on tuesday , saying that when @entity158 was interviewed by oversight chairman @entity194 ' he never talked about this			2
' ' he had plenty of opportunities to do it , he did n't , ' @entity35 claimed , noting that the committee questioned him ' extensively			2
' ' but keep in mind we have allegations seem to come out every week , ' he said , others of which have turned out to be erroneous .			0

the @entity53 's @entity39 on @entity6 has a $ 3.3 million *budget* for this year
@entity1 say key questions about the september 11 , 2012 assault have already been ' asked and answered ' in other hearings and investigations
