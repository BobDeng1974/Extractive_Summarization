the moment was laced with symbolism			2
just as @entity3 was walking into @entity5 ’s press room , news began to filter through that @entity6 was up and running in @entity7			1
before @entity3 had settled into his chair and explained 90 minutes of frustration , clips were already circulating on the internet of the goal @entity6 had created three minutes into his @entity14 debut with an inch - perfect cross-field pass for @entity16			1
how @entity17 could have done with such ingenuity as they huffed and puffed against @entity19			1
it was n’t that they were particularly bad in this 0 - 0 draw , it was just they missed a spark to ignite everything , to turn the weight of possession into the goals			1
@entity30 watched on in the stands as @entity17 struggled against @entity19 at @entity5 this is only the second time in 13 games against @entity19 that @entity17 have failed to score			1
@entity17 have scored 13 @entity35 goals this season			1
they had 17 by the same stage last term			2
nobody expected @entity17 to match the 100 - plus strikes of last season once @entity6 had departed for @entity42 , but they have gone from being a team that you expected to score heavily every time they set foot on a pitch to one that has lost a killer instinct			1
own goal 3 @entity52 3 @entity53 2 @entity54 1 @entity55 1 @entity30 1 @entity56 1 @entity57 1 ‘ i think we had that confidence last season , ’ @entity3 said			2
‘ when we go into games we still have it			0
that confidence does n’t diminish			0
what was important here was if we did n’t score then we did n’t concede			2
it was just unfortunate that we did n’t get three points			0
’ unfortunate or careless ? though @entity67 , @entity19 ’s third - choice goalkeeper , earned himself a generous ovation from @entity69 at the final whistle after making a string of late saves , the best of which came from @entity54 , he should have been taken out of the equation			1
@entity77 , inevitably , had the game ’s defining moment in injury time but , after a magical piece of play from @entity54 , the @entity76 got his feet caught in the wrong position and kicked at fresh air just as the stadium was ready to shout ‘ goal ’			1
@entity6 had an impressive debut for @entity14 setting up @entity16 's opener against @entity90 @entity77 had another frustrating afternoon for @entity17 missing a golden opportunity late on @entity17 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity92 7 ; @entity93 7 , @entity94 7 , @entity95 6.5 , @entity96 6.5 ; can 6 ( @entity55 75min , 6 ) , @entity53 7.5 , @entity97 6 ( @entity54 61 , 7 ) ; @entity52 7 , @entity77 6.5 , @entity57 6 ( @entity98 61 , 7.5 )			1

@entity19 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity67 8 ; @entity104 7.5 , @entity105 7 , @entity106 7 ; @entity107 6.5 , @entity108 6 , @entity109 6.5 , @entity110 7.5 ( @entity111 86 ) , @entity112 7.5 ; @entity113 7 ( @entity114 71 , 6 ) , @entity115 6 ( @entity116 71 , 5.5 )			1
subs not used : @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121			0
booked : @entity113 , @entity108			0
man of the match : @entity67			0
‘ he will be disappointed because he had two big chances , ’ @entity3 observed			0
‘ then there was the one at the end but it was n’t to be			0
it just did n’t fall for him			0
’ it is indicative of where they are at this moment			2
their joint - top scorer — on three — in the @entity35 with @entity52 is ‘ own goal ’ and both of @entity17 ’s next opponents @entity140 ( with @entity141 ) and @entity142 ( @entity143 ) have forwards with better goal tallies			1
perhaps an answer , albeit a temporary one until @entity30 is fit again , would be to deploy @entity77 , who it must be noted was better than he has been , alongside @entity98 in a front two			2
‘ when @entity30 comes back you will see the confidence because of his movement and he is dynamic ’ , explained @entity3			0
‘ but he is n’t fit and has n’t been for a long time			0
so we have to work without him and while we are doing that , we are staying up and around the top end of the table			0
’ as @entity3 knows , however , to stay up there permanently , they need a cutting edge .			0

@entity6 took three minutes to get his first assist for @entity14
@entity17 struggled to a 0 - 0 draw against @entity19 at @entity5
@entity77 was given the game 's defining moment and failed to score
