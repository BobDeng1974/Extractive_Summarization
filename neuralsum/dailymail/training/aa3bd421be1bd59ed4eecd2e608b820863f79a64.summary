it has long been used by @entity1 to speak to aliens and blue women from space - but now @entity5 is on the brink of making a real , working @entity8			0
@entity9 and @entity10 have created software which converts @entity13 speech into any of 26 foreign languages - and which ' speaks ' in the user 's own voice			1
all the user has to do is speak @entity13 into the machine and it will convert it into anything from @entity21 to @entity22			1
@entity23 as @entity1 : the new device is similar to the @entity8 used in @entity25 , and takes around one hour to get used to a person ¿ s voice then works by comparing the words that have been recorded with stock models for the target language @entity9 and @entity10 have created software which converts @entity13 speech into any of 26 foreign languages - and which ' speaks ' in the user 's own voice the hope is that the device will one day allow visitors to foreign countries to have conversations with other people , even though they do not speak the same language - just like in @entity25			1
mr @entity9 told @entity39 that his breakthrough could help language students and might also work with navigational devices			0
in theory it could one day be installed into a smart phone meaning tourists have a ready made translation device sitting in their pockets			0
mr @entity9 said : ‘ we will be able to do quite a few scenario applications			0
‘ for a monolingual speaker traveling in a foreign country , we 'll do speech recognition followed by translation , followed by the final text to speech output in a different language , but still in his own voice ’			2
mr @entity9 and mr @entity10 work at @entity5 ’s hq in @entity61 , @entity59 created the system with colleagues at @entity64 in @entity65 , the company 's second - largest research lab. the two @entity5 researchers believe the technology could be used in smartphone translation apps in @entity25 it was supposedly introduced in the late 22nd century and helped the crew of the @entity73 communicate with aliens as the explored the universe			1
mr @entity9 and mr @entity10 however have made their version today , even if the voice which comes out in the foreign language still sounds a little mechanical			2
heir device needs around one hour to get used to a person ’s voice then works by comparing the words that have been recorded with stock models for the target language			1
the technology has been designed so that it does not just translate words , which would give it a computerised and disjointed sound			0
instead the sounds are carefully manipulated to mimic real speech as realistically as possible .			0

software speaks in user 's own voice
can translate into languages from @entity21 to @entity22
speaks *smoothly* in *sentences* , not individual words
could be built into smartphone language apps
