the mother of @entity1 , the @entity2 journalist beheaded by @entity3 , spoke tonight of her deep disappointment felt towards the @entity6 administration for their handling of his time as a prisoner of the terror group , saying , ' i really feel our country let @entity15 down			1
' on the 13th anniversary of 9/11 and the day after president @entity6 addressed the nation and finally offered a strategy to defeat @entity3 , @entity16 told @entity20 that ' as an @entity2 ' , she was ' embarrassed and appalled ' at the efforts to rescue her son from captivity			1
articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview , mrs. @entity16 made the startling claim that @entity2 officials threatened her family with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom for @entity16 , 40 , and said ' @entity15 was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization			1
' and in a thinly veiled attack on @entity6 's new strategy to ' degrade and destroy ' @entity3 she said that meeting violence with more violence may not be the answer and said , ' bombing caused @entity15 's death			1
' ' @entity15 was killed in the most horrific way			0
he was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination , lack of communication , lack of prioritization , ' said @entity16			0
' as a family , we had to find our way through this on our own			0
at times withering in her assessment of the @entity6 administration 's co-ordination with her family , mrs. @entity16 poured scorn on the @entity67 's claim they tried to rescue @entity16 on july 4 , only to raid the wrong base			1
speaking to @entity20 's @entity69 , mrs. @entity16 said her family knew where @entity1 was being held on two separate occasions in @entity72 , and that each time he was there for months following his capture on @entity74 , 2012			1
she bemoaned the fact that a military option took so long to put together and felt the whole disastrous operation , which defense secretary @entity78 surprisingly labeled ' flawless ' , was in fact ' awful '			0
in a damning indictment of the effort at home and abroad to rescue @entity16 , who was kidnapped in northern @entity72 while working for @entity83 , mrs. @entity16 said that the @entity84 were asking her family for information on her eldest son			1
' we tended to know everything before the @entity84 or anyone else			0
everyone was kind and supportive , but the @entity84 used us for information , ' she said			2
devastated : @entity16 and @entity93 talk to reporters , on wednesday august 20 , 2014 outside their home in @entity96 , @entity97			0
the day before shocking footage of their son 's execution was posted online asked why this was , mrs. @entity16 said , ' because we did everything we could			1
' throughout the 20 month ordeal , mrs. @entity16 said she came to regard her and her family 's efforts to rescue @entity1 as ' an annoyance ' to the administration and began to feel that their desperation to bring @entity1 home did not ' seem to be in the strategic interest , if you will			1
' @entity117 spokesman @entity116 said during his daily briefing with reporters on friday that @entity16 's rescue was indeed a ' priority ' to the administration as evidenced by the ' high - risk mission ' carried out by the administration to find recover him			1
@entity116 claimed that the mission ' was successfully executed ' even though it did not bring about the release of mrs. @entity16 's son			1
the @entity6 spokesman said he was not in ' a position to detail the kinds of conversations ' that took place between the @entity6 administration that the @entity16 family , however , and directed questions about the threat of prosecution to the @entity137			1
speaking generally , @entity116 confirmed that it is the policy of the administration not to pay ransoms			0
that policy stops terrorist organizations from having a stream of funds and it keeps @entity2 safe , he said			0
the @entity145 's deputy spokesman @entity144 was a more forthcoming during a briefing with reporters that afternoon , explaining that it is ' part of our job ' at @entity152 to help families understand the laws about paying ransom to terrorists			0
she confirmed that the @entity16 family asked questions about those laws while their son was being held hostage and that the government provided them answers			2
' but this department would never and did not not ever intend to , nor do think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening , ' she said			0
she later said that ' everything that we do is driven by what would be best for the hostages			0
' captured and executed : @entity1 was taken hostage on @entity74 , 2012 , while working for @entity83 in northern @entity72 and executed - video of the brutal act was released online on august 19 @entity2 freelance reporter @entity1 was kidnapped in war - torn @entity72 in november , 2012 and executed by his @entity3 captors in a video posted online on august 19 of this year strategy : president @entity6 addresses the nation from the @entity179 in the @entity117 in @entity180 on wednesday and said he had authorized @entity2 airstrikes inside @entity72 for the first time , along with expanded strikes in @entity184 , as part of " a steady , relentless effort " to root out @entity188 extremists on august 19 , @entity3 released a gruesome video online which showed the beheading of @entity16 by a masked @entity3 militant , who told the camera in a @entity194 accent , that his ' real killer ' was the @entity2			1
exactly two weeks later , another @entity2 journalist , @entity196 , was beheaded , apparently by the same man , who tells the camera , ' i 'm back @entity6 '			1
during the efforts to get @entity1 home , mrs. @entity16 said she met good people , people who wanted to help , but was adamant that she did n't want to single anyone out and lay ' blame '			2
mrs. @entity16 said it was important to remember that @entity3 is the enemy and not the @entity2			1
however , ultimately , she ' did n't feel that @entity15 was a priority			0
' ' we were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow , miraculously , ' said @entity16 's mother to @entity20			1
' and he was n't , was he ? ' speaking to @entity20 's @entity69 , @entity16 said that she felt cut off at every avenue by @entity2 officials and were threatened with prosecution should they try to pay for her son 's return - a move that left her feeling ' horrified '			1
still startled by this aggressive enforcement of official @entity2 policy , mrs. @entity16 said she could n't believe it because ' no one has ever been prosecuted for trying to get their child back			2
' mrs. @entity16 said that of course she had watched the president 's address to the nation on wednesday night , but said that the @entity2 needs to reconsider its position on negotiating with terrorists			1
' i pray that our government will be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made , ' she said to @entity20 , ' and to acknowledge that there are better ways for @entity2 citizens to be treated			2
' ' this whole strategy to eliminate @entity3 and the terror threat is important , obviously , so perhaps part of the strategic way of doing that is to bomb them , and to engage in force			0
but that only caused @entity15 's death , ' she said			0
' i guess all i 'm trying to say is that our government needs to be shrewder , smarter , willing to negotiate with these people who hate us , so that we can find better ways to rid ourselves of terror			0
' on wednesday night from the @entity117 , the president said of @entity3 , ' they enslave , rape , and force women into marriage			0
they threatened a religious minority with genocide			0
in acts of barbarism , they took the lives of two @entity2 journalists -- @entity261 and @entity262			0
' three weeks after @entity16 's death , the president finally outlined his strategy to defeat @entity3 , after weeks of mixed messages , including admitting at one point that he had ' no strategy ' for the militant group			2
in response , @entity2 national security adviser @entity270 said that she felt the @entity16 family had done an ' amazing job ...			1
to bring @entity15 home safely ' and that she ' and others in the @entity2 government worked very hard with @entity277 and her family to try to be supportive , to try to provide what information we could			2
' she denied the mission to rescue him was a failure , despite the special forces team assaulting completly the wrong @entity3 camp			2
' unfortunately , they were no longer there , ' said @entity288			0
' but i think that effort ... underscores the importance that we attach to doing everything that we possibly can to bring @entity2 in captivity back home			0
