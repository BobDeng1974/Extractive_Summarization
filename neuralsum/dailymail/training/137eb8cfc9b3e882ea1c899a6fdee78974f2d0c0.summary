by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 03:59 est , 25 january 2013 @entity2 's unemployment rate has soared to record levels with a shocking 55 per cent of young people now out of work and experts warning worse is to come			1
the jobless total rose to 26 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 , equivalent to 5.97 million people according to the @entity10 and up from 25 per cent in the previous quarter			1
it is the highest level since measurements began in the 1970s as a prolonged recession and deep spending cuts left almost six million people out of work at the end of last year			1
crisis : a man waits outside a @entity21 employment office			0
latest figures reveal @entity2 unemployment has reached an all - time high over past 12 months 691,700 more people have fallen out of work , the institute said , adding that there were now 1.8 million households in which no one was employed			1
' we have n't seen the bottom yet and employment will continue falling in the first quarter , ' said @entity36 strategist @entity35			2
@entity2 sank into its second recession since 2009 at the end of 2011 after a burst housing bubble left millions of low - skilled laborers out of work and sliding private and business sentiment gutted consumer spending and imports			1
unemployment in @entity2 now stands at a record 26 per cent , higher than any other @entity48 country efforts by prime minister @entity51 's government to control one of the euro zone 's largest deficits through billions of euros of spending cuts and tax hikes have fueled general malaise , further hampering demand			1
when @entity51 took office in late 2011 there were 5.27 million jobless in @entity2			1
the economic downturn put an average of 1,900 out of work every day through 2012 and with the recession expected to last at least until the end of 2013 , net job creation is unlikely this year			2
sorry scene : over the year , 691,700 more @entity2 people lost their jobs , meaning there are now 1.8 million households in which no one was employed joblessness has been particularly acute for @entity2 's youth , with 60 percent of people under the age of 25 unemployed in the fourth quarter			1
in the fourth quarter , the economy shrank at its fastest pace since the recession began , the @entity79 said on wednesday , dragged down by a steep drop in private consumption due in part to a september vat hike and public wage cuts			2
@entity2 is in the throes of its second recession in just over three years following the collapse of its once - booming real estate sector in 2008			2
battling to reduce a swollen deficit and avoid a bailout , the year - old conservative government has brought major financial and labor reforms and applied severe cutbacks in wages and spending but so far the economy has shown few signs of recovery			0
the austerity measures are aimed at lowering the deficit , but are hurting the economy in the short - term , while the reforms will only help growth in the longer - term			0
that means the economy will suffer more before it recovers			0
the central bank this week estimated that the recession deepened in the fourth quarter of last year , the economy shrinking by 0.6 percent compared with the previous three - month period			0
it was the sixth consecutive quarterly contraction			0
the economy contracted by 0.4 percent in the third quarter			0
the bank estimated economic activity was down 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter from the year - earlier period and down 1.3 percent for the whole of 2012			0
the statistics institute will announce official economic growth figures on jan. 30 , while @entity122 's main statistics office @entity121 unveils its estimate on feb. 14 .			0

5.97 million without jobs following prolonged recession and spending cuts
it is the highest level since measurements began in the 1970s
over past 12 months a further 691,700 people have fallen out of work
there are now 1.8 million @entity2 households in which no one is employed
and financial experts warn ' we have n't seen the bottom yet '
