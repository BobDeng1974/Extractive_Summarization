by @entity0 published : 08:33 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 27 may 2013 affecting more than eight out of 10 women , cellulite is considered one of the curses of our gender ... but the next weapon in the quest to banish orange - peel thighs has arrived			1
a pioneering invasive cosmetic treatment which targets the dreaded appearance of quilted , pitted fat has hit the market causing a media storm			2
cellulite occurs when the strands that connect the layers of tissue and the fat below the skin ( fibrous septae ) gradually harden and contract , while the fat between stays the same and protrudes out in a lumpy fashion			2
diet , exercise , creams and massage could help , but rarely manages to permanently shift cellulite diet , exercise , creams and massage do help , but chronic sufferers are constantly on the look out for a long - term solution			2
the @entity36 magazine has repotred that new laser cellulite treatment @entity37 claims to melt the fat and then break down the fibres anchoring the tiny fat pockets , thus banishing the appearance of cellulite			1
it is the first scientifically validated laser cellulite treatment to win the approval of the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , which accepted the results of @entity37 's year - long trial last january			1
the study was conducted in the @entity49 and monitored a group of women with an average age of 47			0
it showed that just one @entity37 treatment prevented the return of cellulite for at least a year			1
there are even claims that the earliest patients have remained cellulite - free for three years			1
the treatment , which costs upwards of £ 2,500 , takes one to two hours and involves a local anaesthetic and mild sedation , followed by the insertion of a laser rod , like a fine knitting needle , just below the surface of the skin through a series of tiny cuts , reported the @entity36			1
women in the @entity71 spend a staggering £ 56 million a year on anti-cellulite products laser beams then transmit energy sideways from the rod to smooth out lumpy fat cells and heat dermal tissue			1
the method promotes skin thickening and tightening , resulting in tighter , smoother skin			0
the laser directly targets the structure of cellulite			2
as well as destroying the lumps , it stimulates collagen production just below the surface , and , in most cases , gives a smoother result than anything previously achieved by other anticellulite treatments			0
the @entity37 laser fiber claims to level out bumps of fat , treat dimples by releasing the fibrous bands that pull down on the skin , and stimulate collagen production to increase skin ’s depth and elasticity for a smoother look			1
liquefied fat is then pressed out			0
@entity105 , a consultant plastic surgeon at the @entity107 clinic in @entity108 , was the @entity71 pioneer , and has now become the principal specialist training other doctors from across @entity112 in the technique			0
he warns that not every patient will benefit			0
' we classify cellulite severity from one to four , ' he says			0
' this treatment works best on stages two and three			0
in other words , women with serious cellulite will first have to lose fat by other methods			2
' wraps and massages can only go so far the physician will mark the areas of cellulite to be treated with a marker a couple of small incisions will be made , about the size of the tip of a pen local anesthesia or numbing solution is used ( you 'd be awake during the procedure ) the @entity37 laser fiber is threaded through a very small tube and inserted through the incision treatment involves a local anaesthetic and mild sedation , followed by the insertion of a laser rod the cosmetic surgeon @entity148 , of the @entity149 in @entity150 , underwent the training last december and has already treated 15 women			1
' i am cautiously optimistic that it works , but i think most patients will also have to make lifestyle changes such as diet and more exercise to maintain the results , ' she told the @entity36			0
if you ’re prepared to go down the invasive route to reduce those lumps and bumps - and you do n't mind investing £ 2,500 for a year of silky smooth thighs - then this laser - powered treatment may be worth a go			1
@entity37 has caused a media storm and boasts impressive trial results			0

@entity45 approved treatment costs from £ 2,500 per *session*
