a ground - breaking experiment has concluded that plants like being spoken to - and are particularly partial to a @entity8 accent			1
@entity10 and @entity11 tones also bear fruit			0
@entity8 pet ? plants played music by @entity16 and @entity17 grew more than those subjected to other accents however , @entity21 and @entity22 might want to keep quiet while in the garden , as flowers and foliage played @entity28 songs and snippets of reality show @entity10 failed to thrive			1
prince @entity30 , who in 1986 was widely ridiculed for telling the nation how he liked to talk to his plants , should also perhaps garden in silence			2
the fun experiment , carried out at an @entity10 nursery over the summer , found that for reasons only known to themselves , plants do n't like upper - class accents			2
gardening website owner @entity39 began by creating ten groups of bedding plants , each containing around 100 plants , and placing them in different areas of his nursery			2
at an @entity49 nursery , the plants spoken to in a @entity8 accent grew almost 10 per cent than the others then , he and his staff started to speak to the plants in a variety of accents			1
appropriate tv programmes and songs were also played			0
for instance , the plants in the @entity59 group were spoken to in a @entity8 accent and played songs by @entity16 and @entity17 & dec. episodes of @entity63 gave a taste of @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 were used for @entity69 voices and the tv show the only way is @entity72 provided upper - class tones			1
in all , eight @entity75 accents were tried , plus @entity77 and @entity78 ones			0
class barrier : episodes of made in @entity72 ( cast pictured ) were used for upper - class tones and the plants on the receiving end seemed to struggle but it was the @entity59 accent that triumphed , with these plants growing almost 10 per cent more than some others			1
mr @entity39 , who runs the @entity88 website , said : ' it 's long been thought that plants thrive if you talk to them so we decided to find out once and for all which dialects they respond to best			0
' after just a few weeks we started to see differences emerging with the @entity8 and @entity11 groups shooting up while the @entity72 and @entity99 plants seemed to particularly struggle			1
' we kept all other variables as constant as possible			0
so the plants all had the same amount of sunlight , water and nutrients			0
' by the end of the summer it was clear that the accents had a huge effect			0
there was , more or less , average growth across the @entity78 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity77 groups			0
' the @entity8 and @entity11 groups visibly thrived and displayed enhanced growth while the @entity21 , @entity72 and @entity99 plants were stunted			1

plants spoken to in a @entity8 accent grew 10 per cent more than others
the ones spoken to in @entity72 and @entity99 accents struggled
