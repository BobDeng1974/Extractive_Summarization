he revolutionised how we clean our homes but now sir @entity3 is hoping to boost the battery life of our smartphones , cars and - of course - our vacuum cleaners			1
the 67 - year - old inventor and entrepreneur has invested $ 15 million ( £ 10 million ) in @entity12 - based battery experts @entity13			1
the company has developed a range of ' solid - state ' batteries ( @entity17 ) that store 50 per cent more energy than current models and will make our favourite gadgets smaller and safer			1
the firm has developed a solid - state battery capable of storing double the amount of power as traditional lithium - ion models			1
the batteries could feature in @entity3 's cordless cleaners as well as phones and other gadgets it is the first investment sir @entity3 has made outside of his bagless vacuum business			1
batteries have three main components - the anode , cathode and electrolyte			0
this electrolyte is typically a chemical that separates the anode and cathode and moves the flow of electrical charge between the two			0
the majority of batteries found in phones , electric cars and sir @entity3 ' range of cordless vacuums use lithium - ion ( @entity56 ) battery technology			1
lithium - ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte and because lithium is a highly - reactive element it stores a large amount of energy			1
but this liquid electrolyte is often flammable and has been blamed for batteries bursting into flames when overheated , for example			2
due to the safety implications of placing flammable liquids in electric cars , too , many of these auto - based batteries have added safety features making them expensive to run			0
lithium - ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte but this liquid electrolyte is flammable			1
@entity24 's ssbs are based on the same li - ion technology but replace the liquid electrolyte with a coating of non-flammable metal			1
this makes them safer , smaller , ( pictured ) more robust and mean they can be used at higher temperatures in particular the battery has to be cooled down and can never fully charge or discharge resulting in wasted capacity			2

the charge is created by chemical reactions on the electrodes and the majority of batteries found in phones , electric cars and sir @entity3 ' range of cordless vacuums use lithium - ion ( @entity56 ) technology			1

@entity24 's ssbs are based on the same li - ion technology but replace the liquid electrolyte with a coating of non-flammable metal			1
this not only makes them safer for both the consumer and the environment , but they are also more robust - liquid electrolytes can be easily damaged - and can be used at higher temperatures			0

@entity56 are extremely sensitive to high temperatures and it can cause them to degrade faster , for instance			0
@entity24 has already designed an @entity17 with an energy density rating - the amount of energy stored it can store - of 1,100 watt hours per litre			2
this is said to be 50 per cent higher than than current lithium - ion batteries			2
the firm has also demonstrated its prototype can survive more charge - discharge cycles than traditional @entity56 which typically last two or three years - whether they are used or not			0
other companies including @entity144 are also working on developing similar technology			0
sir @entity3 ' investment in @entity24 is part of a larger $ 20miillion ( £ 13 million ) round of investment that will see the technology sold commercially and added to @entity3 products			2
this would include the firm 's latest cordless @entity156 designed to work with wooden floorboards , ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring			0
sir @entity3 said : ' @entity24 has achieved leaps in performance which current battery technology simply ca n't			2
it 's these fundamental technologies - batteries , motors - that allow machines to work properly			0
' the @entity24 team has amazing ambitions , and their platform offers the potential for exponential performance gains that will supercharge the @entity3 machines we know today			0

@entity23 inventor sir @entity3 has invested $ 15 million in @entity24
firm 's solid - state battery stores more power than *standard* lithium - ion
solid - state batteries ( @entity17 ) are typically smaller than li - ion batteries
ssbs replace liquid electrolyte in current li - ion with a metal coating
this makes them more robust , safer and can double the energy density
batteries will feature in @entity3 's range of cordless vacuum cleaners
technology could also be used in smartphones to double battery life
