@entity0 are within touching distance ; they can almost smell the big - time			1
another hurdle on their way to the @entity5 has been negotiated as they secured a hard - fought win over @entity8			0
this was tense , though			0
manager @entity10 would testify to that			0
but winning a place in the top - flight has never been easy ; @entity0 are finding exactly that out			1
@entity15 celebrates after opening the scoring for @entity0 in the fourth minute @entity15 opens the scoring for @entity0 early on against @entity8 at the @entity17 @entity8 : @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 ( @entity24 67 ) , @entity25 ( @entity26 59 ) , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 ( @entity31 81 ) subs not used : @entity34 , @entity33 , @entity35 , @entity36 booked : @entity20 , @entity21 @entity0 : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 69 ) , @entity47 ( @entity48 75 ) , @entity15 ( @entity49 90 ) subs not used : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 goal : @entity15 4 booked : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity15 , @entity46 referee : @entity57 attendance : 18,917 but , as of yet , the @entity59 are n't choking , @entity15 's 22nd goal of the season setting them on their way to a third successive win at the @entity17			1
@entity10 said : ‘ it was nervy , with what ’s at stake it was always going to be that way			0
we defended for our lives and showed incredible mental strength			0
it was a different kind of win than we ’re used to , but results are the most important things now			0
‘ i ’d much rather we were playing total football and doing what we ’ve done all season , but we are finding a new way to win and i ’ll take that at this stage			2
’ there was no doubt over which team needed the three points more			0
this victory secured @entity0 's position in the top - six , meaning - at the very least - that they 'll have a crack at promotion via the play - offs			1
@entity8 , under @entity91 , have all but secured their championship status , and with an @entity94 semi-final date at @entity95 against @entity96 on the horizon the @entity8 , perhaps , had other matters on their mind			0
and so it proved as the @entity59 took a fourth minute lead when @entity15 fired home from close range after @entity44 's shot from the edge of the area struck @entity18 's far post			1
it was exactly the start @entity10 wanted as they looked to maintain their position at the @entity111			0
but the visitors had goalkeeper @entity37 to thank in the 17th minute as he produced an outstanding one - handed save to deny @entity29 's close range effort from @entity22 's cross			1
and @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity22 all waste good opportunities to level for the @entity8 as they mustered a promising response to going behind			0
these were worrying moments for @entity10 , who paced regularly from the dugout to his technical area to holler instructions at his players			0
and despite @entity125 sending a towering header from @entity45 's cross narrowly wide during the dying seconds of the first - half , @entity0 's early mojo had vanished			1
@entity0 's @entity38 ( left ) on the run with @entity130 in hot pursuit players appeal to referee @entity57 ( right ) as @entity15 lies injured on the ground @entity10 would have been happy to get his players in at half - time ; his side , in truth , were starting to rock			1
that 's what pressure does to a team			2
in fairness to the @entity59 , though , not once did they part with the passing principles that have put them on the brink of automatic promotion			2
and the south - coast club looked to have regained their composure during the opening exchanges of the second half			0
though , goalscorer @entity15 was booked for diving in the 55th minute as the striker took the necessity for points too far			1
yet , despite his side 's improvement , @entity10 looked far from comfortable in his technical area			2
and @entity0 were struggling to create the opportunities that would have calmed their manager 's obvious nerves			1
@entity0 manager @entity10 ( centre ) and his players applaud the travelling support there were nervy moments for the travelling @entity0 fans as the end of the match approached one mistake , one moment of magic from a @entity8 player and this match would have been back in the balance			2
not only the match , but his side 's chances of automatic promotion			2
@entity181 went within inches of providing @entity10 and his team the cushion that they desperately craved in the 63rd minute			2
the @entity8 defence made a mockery of trying to clear a @entity0 throw deep inside their half , the ball eventually fell to @entity181 who let fly with a curling left - footed effort that skimmed the top of @entity18 's far post			1
@entity40 then saw his half - volley from the edge of the area held by @entity18 as the visitors started to turn the screw			0
@entity15 ( bottom ) is challenged by @entity8 's @entity200 during the @entity111 clash reading manager @entity91 gestures to his players but the hosts could not find a way back but @entity8 refused to lie down , and had @entity26 not miskicked in the final six minutes then the hosts could easily have pulled level			1
@entity15 missed a glorious chance to seal victory for @entity0 in the 87th minute , but his control let him down at the vital moment			1
and the visitors had endure some terrifying moments as @entity8 laid siege to the @entity59 goal			1
but @entity10 's side held on for another vital victory as their promotion bandwagon rolls on ... just .			0

@entity15 opened the scoring for @entity0 in the fourth minute
it was @entity15 's 22nd goal of the season for the @entity59
@entity0 are *ahead* of @entity225 at the top of the table by one point
