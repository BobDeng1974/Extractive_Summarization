lifesavers : thanks to his friends @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity16 , @entity11 survived a ten - minute cardiac arrest on the football pitch earlier this month @entity11 suffers from congenial heart disease @entity31 , an electrical defect which sometimes sees him suffer heart palpitations			1
when he collapsed during a kick - about on april 12 , his three friends were able to think back to a biology lesson on first aid , and remembered what to do			0

collect photo of @entity11 mountain biking with his friend @entity16 important lessons : when @entity11 collapsed , @entity15 and @entity16 , pictured left and right , were able to call for help while @entity17 , centre , performed cpr after remembering what he had learned on the @entity54 scheme and in biology @entity11 was diagnosed with @entity31 when he was 13 , and although sufferers very rarely are at risk of cardiac arrest , those who are tend to be much older than @entity11			1
in @entity31 ( @entity31 ) syndrome , the heart beats abnormally fast due to an extra electrical connection in the heart			1
it is one of the most common causes of an abnormally fast heart rate in infants and children , but although the syndrome is congenital , it is often not detected until the child is 10 - 13			2
the heart of a person with @entity31 will suddenly suffer heart palpitations , before the heartbeat stopps or slows down abruptly			1
the length and frequency of these episodes varies from person to person			0
in many cases , episodes of abnormal heart activity associated with @entity31 syndrome are harmless , do n't last long and settle down on their own without treatment			1
source : @entity88 today , @entity11 has been reunited with his best friends as they were awarded a certificate for their heroic actions			1
he said : ‘ i really ca n't remember any of it			0
' i can remember earlier that day but all i know from what happened is what i have been told			0
‘ it has been frustrating being stuck in hospital now because i feel fine			0
' i ca n't believe what the boys did			0
i am indebted to them really			0
‘ i think it has brought us all a lot closer together			0
’ @entity11 ’s friend @entity17 carried out cpr and mouth - to - mouth resuscitation after remembering a lesson he had in school the year before			1
he said : ‘ we 'd had a bike ride and had stopped to play a game of football when @entity11 suddenly collapsed			1
‘ we thought he was mucking about at first so kicked the ball to him but he did n't react so we knew then that something was seriously wrong			0
back on his feet : @entity11 , pictured at @entity44 with his mother @entity116 , father @entity117 and his twin sister @entity118 , is expected to make a full recovery best buddies : the 16 - year - olds , pictured @entity122 are @entity17 , @entity16 and @entity15 have all been awarded for their bravery when @entity11 suffered a cardiac arrest ‘ i think we just did what we did automatically ; i do n't think it really sunk in until @entity11 had been put in the ambulance			1
cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( @entity6 ) is a first aid technique that can be used if someone is not breathing properly or if their heart has stopped			2
always start with calling 999 before performing any type of cpr			0
if you have not been trained in @entity6 , your should do chest compression only : try to perform 100 - 120 chest compressions a minute			0
if you ’ve been trained in cpr you should give chest compressions with rescue breaths			0
source : @entity88 ‘ i had done some cpr as part of @entity142 and we had a lesson about the heart in biology last year so i just did what i could			2
‘ @entity11 was sick as well so i knew we had to clear his airways and i did mouth - to - mouth			2
’ @entity11 's mother @entity116 , 44 , a nurse , said yesterday : ‘ @entity11 is very lucky to have such good friends			1
‘ they saved his life , i hate to think what would have happened if he was on his own			0
‘ everyone should learn how to do cpr because you never know when you 'll need to use it			0
’ @entity11 is expected to be in hospital until tuesday when he will undergo a cardiac ablation to repair his irregular heartbeat			1
cardiologist dr @entity164 , who is treating @entity11 , said : ‘ with @entity11 's condition it is an extra electrical condition in the heart and mostly it did n't cause problems			2
‘ certainly not heart attacks anyway			0
‘ the majority of young people do n't collapse			0
but because @entity11 did we are going to do the operation to hopefully get rid of that extra electrical connection ‘ if it is successful he will not need any more medication and if it is not then he will need another operation so we can try again			2
