the match , coming between home @entity7 games against @entity74 and @entity75 , was always likely to be a hard sell for the home club			0

wednesday spurned another good opportunity when @entity52 headed narrowly over from a @entity53 corner			0
@entity5 and @entity18 then had a major let - off when the defender slid in to cut out a @entity53 cross and turned the ball against his own woodwork for what was almost a spectacular own goal			1
going in where it hurts : @entity3 's @entity49 gets there first in tuesday 's clash at @entity11 after that the @entity5 began to settle and dominate possession			1

@entity38 should have done better when picked out by @entity35 but headed wide from in front of goal			0
@entity34 had a speculative effort from a free - kick inside the centre circle but @entity97 saved comfortably enough			2
@entity131 might have been extended before the break after a @entity13 run but a deflection took the pace out of his shot			0
