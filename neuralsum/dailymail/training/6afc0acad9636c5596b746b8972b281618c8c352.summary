by @entity0 and @entity1 crews are continuing their frantic search for dozens of victims still missing after saturday 's landslide in @entity6 - but authorities say they may have to leave some bodies buried			1
search crews using dogs , bulldozers and their bare hands are slogging through the mess of broken wood and mud , looking for more bodies or anyone who might still be alive nearly five days after a wall of fast - moving earth destroyed a small rural community			1
authorities have said that recovering every corpse would be impractical and dangerous - and now families are being forced to accept that their loved ones might never be found			1
the debris field is about a square mile and 30 to 40 feet deep in places , with a moon - like surface that includes quicksand - like muck , rain - slickened mud and ice			1

' @entity116 spoke via phone about a wedding the family had planned for summer at the rural home that was destroyed			2
