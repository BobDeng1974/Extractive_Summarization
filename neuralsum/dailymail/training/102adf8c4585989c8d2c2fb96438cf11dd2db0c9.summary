so he may well end up with his mother 's chestnut locks			0
but for now , he and his father share a rather fluffy , fine , sandy thatch			0
and both father and son 's coiffures were left rather ruffled by the stiff @entity21 breeze			1
@entity9 - freshly tended to by on - board hairdresser , @entity39 ( paid for by @entity40 out of his private fortune ) - looked eminently salon - worthy , if a little wind - whipped			2
a red pillbox hat secured her long hair			0
