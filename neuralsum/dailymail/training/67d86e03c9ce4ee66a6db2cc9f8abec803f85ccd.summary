@entity0 has come under fire for abandoning its policy of selling only @entity4 - free food			1
the store is selling six products containing genetically - modified soya or corn despite having long presented itself as being opposed to such engineered products			1
the six are teriyaki , ginger and hibachi sauces from the @entity16 brand , and three flavours of @entity19 – sugar , chocolate , and cranberry and orange			1
@entity0 is selling six products containing genetically - modified soya or corn despite having long presented itself as being opposed to such engineered products other stores are also selling an increasing number of imported @entity27 foods from brands including @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 that contain @entity4 ingredients			1
the move has been condemned by critics of the technology who say it is evidence of the insidious way so - called frankenstein foods are being introduced			1
last year , @entity0 , @entity41 , @entity39 ’s and the co-op abandoned pledges to ensure animals supplying milk , eggs , chicken , pork and beef were not fed a @entity4 diet			2
it means some food on supermarket shelves comes from animals fed on @entity4 crops , without this fact being declared on the label			2
three flavours of @entity19 , which contain @entity4 ingredients , are being sold at @entity0 @entity0 and @entity41 have a policy not to use @entity4 ingredients in their own - label products , but it is now clear there are no such assurances for other brands			1
the @entity16 sauce is the first @entity4 food allowed on to @entity0 shelves , while @entity41 has gradually started to sell these products			1
there was a row last year when it emerged @entity41 was stocking @entity27 @entity71 cereal , which is made from @entity4 corn – a fact buried in small print on the package – and contains artificial colours that the @entity77 has linked to hyperactivity in young children			1
but a free trade treaty that is being negotiated between the @entity81 and the @entity27 is set to further open the door to @entity27 gm foods			2
dr @entity84 , of the research group @entity85 , said the growing of @entity4 soya and maize used in the teriyaki sauce sold by @entity0 has had a devastating impact on butterflies			1
she said : ‘ by importing this product , @entity0 is contributing to the devastating crash in monarch butterfly populations			0
@entity97 on @entity4 soya and maize has destroyed vast swathes of the habitat			1
customers are likely to be shocked by this cavalier disregard for the environment			0
’ @entity103 , of campaigners @entity105 , added : ‘ people expect to be able to trust their favourite retailers , who would n’t put these ingredients in their own brand products			2
’ @entity0 said : ‘ this is a very small number of products			0
they are clearly not @entity0 - branded products and are clearly labelled			2
‘ this in no way affects our commitment to only using @entity119 food ingredients in @entity0 food			0
’ a @entity41 spokesman said : ‘ our @entity27 range is very popular			0
all products are clearly labelled in line with relevant legislation			0
’ health and consumer groups have slammed attempts by the @entity81 and the food industry to kill off ‘ traffic light ’ labels adopted in @entity132 to help tackle obesity			0
the labels help shoppers identify foods high in sugar , fat and salt			0
the @entity141 is threatening to take @entity132 to court unless the scheme is scrapped , after @entity145 bureaucrats appear to have given in to the foreign food industry			0
they claim the @entity132 labels create a barrier to foreign food firms and amount to an illegal restraint of trade			0
cardiologist dr @entity153 , of @entity154 , said the @entity81 move was ‘ scandalous ’ .			0
