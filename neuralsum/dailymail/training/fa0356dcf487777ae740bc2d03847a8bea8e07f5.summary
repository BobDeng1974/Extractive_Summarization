@entity0 has been sensationally cleared of having sex with underage exotic dancer @entity2 the @entity3 at his notorious ' bunga bunga ' parties			1
the former @entity6 premier , 77 , had been sentenced to seven years jail for sex with the @entity9 former nightclub dancer , real name @entity8 when she was just 17 and for using his influence to get her released from police cutody			1
but in a shock verdict , judges in @entity16 overturned the conviction on appeal , saying that the facts ' do not constitute a crime			1
he said : ' only those close to me over the years know how i have suffered at these unjust and defamatory accusations			1
' my first thoughts today go to my loved ones , who have suffered with me years of media aggression , gossip , slander , and who have remained beside me with unmatched affection and serenity			1
' i have always said that the vast majority of @entity6 judges do their work quietly , with admirable balance and rigour , something that was confirmed today			1
' @entity0 was convicted for having sex with @entity8 , nicknamed ' @entity8 ' when she was 17 @entity0 had always claimed the parties were ' elegant dinners ' followed by burlesque cabaret , but the court heard of poledancing , strip teases and erotic games , all performed for the benefit of the master of the house			1
a troupe of girls had received cash and gifts for attending the dinners			0
the ex prime minister was also accused of telling police that @entity2 was the niece of deposed @entity68 dictator @entity67 in order to get her released from jail			1
but the judges said that these allegations were ' unfounded '			1
the judges have three months to fully explain their reasoning			1
but lawyer for the defence @entity77 said it was a verdict that is ' even better our rosiest predictions			0
' he said : ' from a rational point of view the judges could not but absolve him			1
it could be that the judges said the crime did not exist because the ex-premier did not know that @entity2 was underage			2
' ' the absolution for abuse of office is easier to understand ' , he said , ' because it means simply the proof is inexistent			0
' the flamboyant politician heard the news at the old people 's home where he is currently serving a one year sentence of community service for tax fraud in connection to the acquisition of rights for @entity105 films			2
the media mogul has been tried more than thirty times but convicted only once definitively			2
the verdict could herald the start of a political comeback			0
while he has been banned from holding political office personally , @entity0 is still head of the opposition centre right @entity114 party			0
in a brief statement read out in court , the judges fully acquitted 77 - year old @entity0 on both charges			2
they will release their motivations in 90 days			0
' a verdict that goes beyond our rosiest expectations , ' @entity0 's lawyer @entity77 told reporters			0
the four - times prime minister , still the most influential politician on the centre right , had always denied the charges , accusing the @entity16 magistrates of hounding him for political reasons			1
' finally justice has been done ' said @entity131 of @entity0 's @entity114 party in a statement			0
' now , let 's all focus on good politics to relaunch @entity114 , tightly knit around our great leader @entity0			0
' friday 's verdict in the most sensational trial faced by @entity0 is not definitive as prosecutors could lodge an appeal with @entity6 's top court			0
the former @entity6 prime minister was also accused of telling police that @entity2 was the niece of deposed @entity68 dictator @entity67 in ordern to get her released from jail the final ruling in the so - called @entity2 trial could have implications for @entity0 and his freedom to engage in political activity beyond the case itself			1
as well as its implications for @entity0 himself , the verdict removes a potential threat to prime minister @entity160 's constitutional reform drive , which depends on an accord with the centre - right			0
that accord could have been threatened had @entity0 's conviction been upheld			2
@entity0 received a definitive conviction for tax fraud last year and was stripped of his seat in parliament			2
he was given a four - year jail sentence , but that was commuted to a year 's community service under a general amnesty , leaving him largely free to campaign in elections and play a political role			0
however , a second definitive conviction in a criminal trial would violate the terms of the amnesty			0
that could mean @entity0 would have to serve time under house arrest .			0
