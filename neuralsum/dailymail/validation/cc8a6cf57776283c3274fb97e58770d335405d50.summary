@entity0 was forced to defend his decision to announce a sell - by date on his premiership yesterday as senior @entity4 accused him of trying to anoint @entity5 as his successor			1
@entity7 was struggling to contain the fallout from the prime minister ’s extraordinary announcement that may ’s general election will be his last			0
friends dismissed rumours that mr @entity0 ’s wife , @entity15 , had asked him to make clear he would not seek a third term if re-elected , while mr @entity0 insisted he had simply given a ‘ straight answer to a straight question ’ and that most people would think that was a ‘ sensible ’ thing to do			1
‘ my entire focus is on the next 44 days and the general election that will decide which team runs the country for the next five years , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
but senior mps warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in @entity36			0
it came as mr @entity0 was reminded of his comments to @entity39 when the former premier announced he was handing over the reins to then - chancellor @entity43 mid-term			1
‘ your authority is draining away , ’ he told mr @entity39 in the @entity44 in january 2007			2
‘ the government ca n’t plan			0
they are all waiting for the chancellor and not listening to you			0
’ one former shadow minister said that by indicating he will depart in the next @entity52 , mr @entity0 appeared to be seeking to head off moves to oust him on may 8 if he falls short of a @entity44 majority and tries to lead another coalition or a minority government			1
@entity0 has revealed he will stand down as prime minister before 2020 if he wins the next election senior mps warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in @entity36			0
pictured : @entity0 visits a butchers in his @entity64 constituency ‘ he may think it will be harder for the men in the grey suits to come knocking when he has said he wo n’t be going on and on , ’ the mp said			1
‘ the truth is he wo n’t last five minutes , let alone five years , if he loses again			0
’ there was particular consternation that mr @entity0 effectively fired the starting gun on a leadership contest by naming three potential successors : home secretary @entity75 , @entity77 mayor @entity76 and mr @entity5 , the chancellor			1
mrs may and mr @entity76 have long been seen the leading rivals to be the next @entity82 leader , but mr @entity0 sparked frenzied speculation at @entity84 by including his name of mr @entity5 , his closest ally			1
since his unpopular budget of 2012 , mr @entity5 ’s leadership prospects have been discounted by many			1
@entity76 @entity76 is the favourite among voters to succeed @entity0 , a poll reveals today			1
but the @entity77 mayor repeatedly refused to say whether he would join a leadership contest			0
chancellor @entity5 is thought to be the prime minister ’s preference to be his successor			2
but in a @entity98 survey for the @entity99 , mr @entity76 was backed by 31 per cent of voters , ahead of @entity75 on 17 per cent and mr @entity5 on 12 per cent			1
support for the mayor among @entity82 voters was particularly strong – 36 per cent said he would make the best prime minister , mr @entity5 was on 25 per cent and mrs may on 18 per cent			2
mr @entity76 ’s strongest backing was among @entity107 supporters , at 44 per cent – suggesting he would do the best job of regaining support from the @entity111 party			1
he was also backed by 32 per cent of @entity23 voters , ahead of mrs may on 19 per cent , and the chancellor on 7 per cent			0
but in an @entity115 interview yesterday , mr @entity76 dodged questions about his ambitions more than a dozen times			1
he is bidding to return as an mp in may in the safe seat of @entity121 , but claimed mr @entity0 ’s intervention was ‘ no big deal ’			1
‘ all he ’s saying is i think obvious and common sense … he does n’t want to go on and on and on like @entity126 , ’ the mayor said			2
‘ to say he ’s arrogant or presumptuous to rule [ out ] a third term seems to be totally bizarre because actually he ’s being rather humble and rather straightforward and telling it like it is			2
’ asked repeatedly if he would go for the party leadership , mr @entity76 said : ‘ i ca n’t possibly answer that because it ’s a long way off			1
we probably do n’t even know the identity of the next leader … it is some baby , unborn			0
’ mr @entity5 praised mr @entity0 for giving ‘ a direct answer ’			1
mrs may is yet to comment			0
but the recent turnaround in his popularity as the economy improves has led many mps to reconsider			0
polls suggest mr @entity5 has become the most popular conservative @entity143 spokesman since @entity145 in 1987			2
‘ @entity0 has propelled @entity5 into the top three , quite deliberately , ’ said one senior mp			1
‘ @entity147 that helps @entity5 or not remains to be seen			2
’ another former minister said : ‘ it ’s not what he has said about timing – it ’s the list of names			2
the parliamentary party does n’t really want any of them			0
@entity75 is a cold loner with a following of about two			0
@entity5 has been a good chancellor of the exchequer , but people resent his coterie of apparatchiks and think he is ultimately unelectable			2
@entity76 is another @entity160 boy who ignored @entity52 when he was last in it and lots of people think would be too risky			2
’ mps also questioned how mr @entity0 could promise to serve a ‘ full second term ’ when a new leader would need at least six months to establish themselves before the 2020 election			1
some allies of the prime minister , however , suggest he could step down as party leader , allowing a contest to take place some months before , while remaining prime minister right up until polling day			0
while this would be unprecedented in modern @entity177 political history , it would mirror the @entity179 system , where a president serves a fixed second term			2
former @entity82 minister @entity182 described mr @entity0 ’s announcement as ‘ bizarre ’			1
he told the @entity184 : ‘ when you play chess you have to consider the next two moves , and i do n’t think he did			0
there is no point setting off on this wild goose chase in the middle of an election campaign			0
’ but defence secretary @entity193 defended the prime minister			0
‘ he made very clear he is standing for a full second term			0
what happens in 2020 really , i think , does n’t bother a lot of people , ’ he said			0
‘ if he had said exactly the opposite – that he wanted to go on and on and he was n’t prepared to answer the question when he was likely to finish – you ’d have accused him , quite rightly , of arrogance and wanting term after term			1
’ a snap poll by @entity98 for the @entity99 found voters are divided over mr @entity0 ’s announcement			1
some 70 per cent believe mr @entity0 was ‘ just being honest ’ , while 80 per cent say ten years is long enough for any prime minister to achieve their plans			1
four in ten said he had made himself a lame duck , but the majority – 59 per cent – disagreed			0
however , 70 per cent said he should be focusing on voters rather than his own job			0
four in ten think the next government would be destabilised by a @entity82 leadership election .			0

@entity0 said earlier this week that he would not bid for a third term
@entity0 said two terms were ' *wonderful* ' but three ' might just be too many '
named @entity76 , @entity75 and @entity5 as successors
has now insisted he was just giving ‘ straight answer to a straight question ’
@entity227 also said he believed most people would think it was a ‘ sensible ’ thing
mr @entity0 said yesterday @entity231 was the television character he most identified with . in an interview with @entity234 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ he ’s a @entity177 icon , he ’s blue , he ’s loyal and reliable – and he always saves the day . ’ @entity237 leader @entity236 opted for @entity238 , while @entity23 ’s @entity239 sees himself as *captain* @entity240 .
