by @entity0 people in @entity2 are among the most unhelpful in @entity3 , according to a unique experiment which tested how many individuals carry out good deeds across the @entity3			1
as part of the unique test , 850 tagged keys were dropped in 15 cities across the country and researchers measured how many ended up at their ‘ owner 's ’ destination			1
@entity15 and @entity16 proved to be the most trustworthy cities in @entity3 , with eight out of 10 keys ( 80 per cent ) being returned to their rightful ‘ owner ’			1
@entity2 was found to be the least altruistic city in the @entity3 , with only one in three keys ( 34 per cent ) being returned to their ' owner ' in the study , which was carried out by lost property retrieval service @entity27 however , @entity2 and @entity28 proved to be the least altruistic with only one in three keys turning up again			1
@entity30 lost property retrieval service @entity32 carried out the @entity33 ( @entity34 ) and a survey in which it quizzed 2,000 people about their altruism			1
in the survey , an overwhelming nine out of ten @entity38 said they would return a missing set of keys if they had a way to notify the owner ( 90 per cent )			0
but the findings from the key - drop experiment revealed just six in 10 people ( 59 per cent ) actually did when given the chance			0
@entity28 - 4 minutes @entity49 - 5 minutes @entity50 - 6 minutes @entity16 - 6 minutes more than one in three people said keys were more valuable than wallets , laptops or even a mobile phone ( 37 per cent )			1
the experiment , which dropped between 50 and 100 keys in each of the 15 cities , found that six out of 10 keys which were returned were reunited with their owner within 24 hours ( 60 per cent )			1
overall , the average return time was six hours			0
one resident in @entity28 alerted the owner of the missing key within a speedy four minutes of the item being lost			2
people in @entity15 were quicker to alert owners than their @entity16 rivals , typically beating them by seven and a half hours			2
@entity16 topped @entity15 's fastest return time of 36 minutes by half an hour to score equal fourth quickest in the country			1
as part of the unique test , 850 tagged keys were dropped in 15 cities across the country and researchers measured how many ended up at their ' owners ' destination dr @entity82 , head of sociology at @entity16 , said busy modern life sometimes gets in the way of ethics			1
dr @entity82 said : ‘ the fast - paced nature of modern life means that , even when we know it would be ethical to act in a certain way , our best intentions are not acted upon			0
@entity16 - 80 per cent @entity94 - 80 per cent @entity15 - 80 per cent @entity95 - 74 per cent @entity96 - 74 per cent @entity97 - 68 per cent @entity49 - 60 per cent @entity50 - 59 per cent @entity98 - 56 per cent @entity99 - 54 per cent @entity100 - 46 per cent @entity101 - 44 per cent @entity102 - 40 per cent @entity28 - 38 per cent @entity2 - 34 per cent ‘ @entity103 shows that when we make it easy for people to be ethical , then a high proportion show acts of kindness to complete strangers			1
‘ if it is made easy to return keys without , for instance , having to make a time - consuming trip to a lost - property office or a police station then a high proportion of people act with empathy and compassion			2
’ young people are most likely to lose their valuables , with 70 per cent having lost their keys at least once , the study found			2
dr @entity82 added : ‘ @entity124 's @entity33 highlights a number of important societal issues			0
‘ sociologists have found that countries and cities differ in what we call ' @entity132 ' , or norms of trust and reciprocity between people			0
‘ returning keys , a simple act of kindness , is an expression of a social capital			0
‘ those cities where the lost keys had higher rates of being returned are probably the cities where people model small acts of kindness , courtesy and respect to each other on a daily basis			2
‘ the study 's findings suggest @entity132 is stronger in the cities of @entity16 , @entity15 and @entity94			1
’ @entity155 , co-founder of @entity27 , said : ‘ we know that people are intrinsically good			0
‘ @entity103 gave the @entity3 the opportunity to prove just that			0
‘ when polled , more than half of the nation admit having lost their keys			0
‘ fuelled by the goodwill of others , @entity124 makes this unfortunate situation less stressful and costly			0
‘ altruism is the heartbeat of society , it unites people and makes them a community			0
