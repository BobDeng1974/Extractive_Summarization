by @entity0 @entity1 has made quite an impact in his first few weeks in @entity4 football			1
his strength of personality and confidence in himself are remarkable			2
during the @entity9 , i happened to be staying in the same hotel as the @entity12 national team in @entity13 and i had the opportunity to chat with him and to see at first hand the influence he had over his players and the team spirit he created			1
and in the run - up to last weekend , everyone seemed to be of one mind : that he could prove an inspired choice as @entity26 manager			2
after last weekend ’s defeat by @entity29 , people are beginning to doubt him a little bit , not least his decision to switch to a back three , the system he played with @entity35 in the @entity9			1
the performance seemed like a re-run of last season			2
a year ago i did say that i thought @entity26 would be struggling to make the top four , because of the departure of sir @entity40			1
but , from what i ’ve seen so far , as long as @entity26 do make a couple of signings , i think this season will be different			2
i ’ll stick my neck out and say @entity46 will have them back in the top four again and qualifying for the @entity48 ; and that will probably be considered job done for the first season			1
mr @entity52 : @entity1 will work his magic at @entity26 they do need a midfielder who can orchestrate and change the play and another defender on top of @entity59 , the @entity60 they have signed from @entity62			1
but with @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , they look strong going forward			2
he changed the system at half - time last weekend when it was n’t working out and went to a back four and ultimately they ended up losing			1
but though he is sure to be flexible , and switch to a back four at times , my feeling is that the back three is a system that is back in fashion for good reasons			1
i ’ve always been an advocate of its strengths , playing it with @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 and now @entity85 has introduced it at @entity87 , where i ’m coaching			2
i think the @entity9 demonstrated that it is very much a system for the modern game			1
i do n’t think there is any other system that is so flexible in allowing you to get into different shapes and formations so quickly			1
@entity96 showed that in @entity98			1
i think that they won @entity84 ’s group largely because of the system they played ; they had options all over the pitch			1
@entity35 played it under @entity46 and @entity106 and @entity107 also used it well			2
remember , @entity109 found it very difficult against @entity112 when the @entity111 team used that system			1
threat : @entity26 look strong going forward with the likes of @entity64 talking tactics : @entity96 used the 3 - 5 - 2 system to great effect at the @entity9 in @entity98 this summer best player : @entity83 defender @entity120 was a natural wing back when i managed @entity84 i did n’t want to be outnumbered in midfield , which has traditionally been a problem with the national team			1
so when we had the ball , we were in the 3 - 5 - 2 shape , to give us that extra man in midfield			2
when we lost the ball , we would slide back into a four and protect ourselves ; when in possession you slide into a wide back three			1
it is a system that can help get you up the ladder , which is how @entity96 used it			1
or , with top - quality players , it can help you create so many problems for the opposition			1
i think most other formations can struggle against it , especially these days when there is a trend towards trying to get two forwards playing together again			0
in a 4 - 4 - 2 you get outnumbered			0
a lot of people are playing a diamond formation , but then you can lack width			1
it allows you to be inventive with player positions , something @entity46 has done a lot in his career			0
do n’t be surprised to see @entity157 playing in the middle of the centre - halves			0
when you get the ball there , you need to use it very well			0
i went back into that position with @entity82 and at @entity83 @entity164 played there for me			1
@entity165 almost played it last year with @entity167 ; if the centre halves got into trouble , he would go in behind them			0
i know some have said that the system can place extraordinary strain on the wing - backs and @entity175 mentioned earlier in the week that he felt that was the case sometimes when he was asked to play in that position			1
but i think it ’s a fallacy that you need to be an extraordinary runner to play as a wing - back			1
@entity120 was the best i managed , because he knew which position he should be in when the ball was on the other side of the pitch			0
sometimes wing - backs think it is hard work but they get caught out by getting too far forward			0
you do n’t have to be right on the back post attacking and the next minute back on the back post defending			1
you do it in phases , depending on where the ball is			0
if you ’re using your physical prowess too much and not your mental prowess , then it can be tough			0
but once you ’ve worked with players on the training pitch , you can put that right			0
and that ’s something at which @entity46 has proved a master over the years			0
give him time to work with the squad and both the players and the system might end up surprising people			1
@entity208 can get the best out of @entity210 @entity167 travel to @entity212 on monday and though he wo n’t play , it ’s likely that @entity214 will be there as a @entity167 player , representing an extraordinary return to the @entity218			0
clearly with @entity214 , it ’s not so much what he can do on the pitch — that obviously can be excellent — it ’s what happens off it which would worry you			0
@entity167 bound : @entity214 is ready to make an extraordinary return to the @entity218 a lot of managers and coaches have fallen out with him			0
but i think @entity208 will see it as a challenge			0
he ’s a very positive manager and has had experience of dealing with @entity235 ’s issues			0
if he can get him firing on all cylinders and if he ’s not getting sent off stupidly and rocking the boat , he will make a massive improvement to the team			0
it puts @entity167 in the frame for the @entity48 again , when most people would have said they might struggle to make the top four without @entity235			1
as such , it ’s probably a risk worth taking			0
@entity85 's offer was right for me on sunday i head back to @entity247 with my new club @entity87			2
while @entity248 will always have a special place in my heart , i have been back with other clubs before and you put your professional hat on for the day			2
i have to make sure i do a good job for @entity87			2
something special : @entity0 with @entity85 on the training ground at @entity87 with @entity85 returning as well , we will have two former @entity248 managers on the bench			0
@entity85 ’s call to me came out of the blue			0
i was n’t looking to get back on the training ground as i have a number of business and media commitments			2
i have had other opportunities to come back and even had some preliminary talks with @entity268 this week			2
but this is the role which seemed to fit with what i wanted and my other interests			0
hopefully , i ’ve got something to offer and @entity85 has been very positive			0
it ’s great to work with @entity274 and @entity275			0
the season will definitely be challenging but i ’m confident we can do something special .			0

after defeat by @entity29 , people are beginning to doubt @entity1
@entity12 will have them back in the top four again
back three is a system that is back in fashion for good reasons
@entity96 showed how to use the flexible system at @entity9
