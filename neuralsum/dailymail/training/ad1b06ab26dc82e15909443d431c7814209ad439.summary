by @entity0 published : 12:09 est , 26 november 2013 @entity2 : 12:57 est , 26 november 2013 a forest floor that behaves like a bouncy trampoline has left scientists baffled			1
the phenomenon , which is thought to be natural , enables people to bounce upon a patch of earth , but scientists are struggling to explain why the ground is behaving as it is			1
a pair of hikers came across the unusual spot close to a river in a forest in @entity17 , @entity18 in @entity19			1
in a video , one of the men bounces on the earth like it is a trampoline , leading people to question whether the video is a hoax			2
however , it is thought the phenomenon is natural			0
the creator of the video told io9 the vegetation around the site is still alive and the earth strong enough to hold ‘ many people '			2
some experts believe the cause of the springy ground is a build - up of roots , while others think it could be a dense patch of peat moss			2
an expert from @entity42 told @entity43 : ' i have heard that some forestry workers falling from trees in temperate old growth forests have survived thanks to the deep layer of organic matter made of part decomposed leaves , fungal mycelium , other fibrous debris , which can absorb the impact of their fall			1
' the creator of the video , who has recorded a man jumping on the springy patch of earth like a trampoline ( pictured ) , said the vegetation around the site is still alive and the earth strong enough to hold ' many people ' scientists are unsure exactly why the patch of earth in @entity19 is so springy			1
theories include : emeritus professor @entity68 , from the @entity70 ’s @entity69 , told @entity43 that the bouncy ground could possibly be explained by ‘ a couple of fallen young trees spanning an hollow , and branches and leaves on top making a platform			1
‘ it could be not a patch of ground at all - it could be natural and not a deliberate hoax			0
’ ‘ if i was out for a walk and came across it i would let my grandchildren see me happy on nature ’s trampoline , ’ he added			0
' i can be pretty certain that that is the most likely reason for the wave effect on the video			0
' another possibility to explain the phenomenon is soil liquefaction , where the ground sucks up a large quantity of water and becomes like an incredible vicious liquid as it is so waterlogged			0
but some experts think the conditions do not look like liquefaction , which usually appears like a patch of earth without foliage .			0

hikers came across the unusual springy patch of earth close to a river in a forest in @entity17 , @entity18 in @entity19
the phenomenon enables people to bounce upon a patch of earth much like a trampoline and can support a number of people
an expert told @entity43 the bouncy ground could be explained by fallen trees spanning a hollow , and branches and leaves on top making a platform
