the ceo of technology firm @entity1 is suing @entity2 and its co-founders @entity3 and @entity5 for allegedly duping him before selling the headphone company to @entity7 for $ 3billion			1
in the complaint , filed in a @entity9 court on tuesday , @entity10 , who also founded the video and audio cable maker , accuses rapper dr @entity3 and record producer mr @entity5 of double crossing him			1
mr @entity10 - who once held a 5 percent stake in beats via a monster - beats partnership that ended in 2012 - claims the pair deliberately orchestrated a ' sham ' deal with smartphone maker @entity20 in 2011			1
this deal , he says , led to the termination of the @entity23 - he pared his stake in beats to 1.25 per cent before selling his remaining holdings for $ 5.5 million in the autumn of 2013			0
however , following dr @entity3 's and mr @entity5 's alleged shady maneuvering , @entity25 announced its sale to @entity7 last may , enabling the pair to become executives at the @entity44 and @entity45 maker			1
had he held on to his 1.25 percent stake , mr @entity10 would have received more than $ 30 million in the @entity7 deal			2
his original 5 percent stake would have been worth roughly $ 150 million			0
both dr @entity3 , whose real name is @entity3 , and mr @entity5 , a longtime recording industry executive , reaped the biggest jackpots in the @entity7 deal			1
however , the precise size of their windfalls has not been disclosed			0
in his lawsuit , mr @entity10 states the pair each owned 15 percent stakes in the early stages of the beats partnership			0
besides dr @entity3 and mr @entity5 , the lawsuit targets @entity60 and @entity61 , a @entity25 investor and board member			1
monster ceo : in the complaint , filed in a @entity9 court on tuesday , @entity10 ( pictured ) , who also founded the video and audio cable maker , accuses rapper dr @entity3 and record producer mr @entity5 of double crossing him ' fraud ' : mr @entity10 - who once held a 5 percent stake in @entity25 ( file picture ) via a monster - beats partnership that ended in 2012 - claims the pair deliberately orchestrated a ' sham ' deal with smartphone maker @entity20 in 2011 @entity7 , which now employs @entity3 and @entity5 , declined to comment on the lawsuit			1
the @entity77 company is n't named in the complaint			0
mr @entity10 's bitterness in his lawsuit seemingly contradicts how he described the culmination of the @entity25 partnership in a late 2013 interview with the @entity84 ( @entity84 )			2
at that time , @entity10 called it an ' amicable ' parting and said he was paid ' very generously ' in royalties			0
this is n't the first time that a former beats partner has lashed out at @entity3 and @entity5 in court			0
@entity91 , who sold his music streaming service @entity93 to beats in 2012 , is suing the pair for bad faith			0
that action , filed shortly before the @entity7 deal , is unfolding in @entity99			0
executives : the @entity20 deal led to the termination of the @entity1 alliance			1
last may , @entity25 announced its sale to @entity7 last may , enabling dr @entity3 ( right ) and mr @entity5 ( left ) to become executives at the @entity44 and @entity45 maker in mr @entity10 's case , he appears to be interested in recovering the money that he believes he lost through the alleged misconduct of dr @entity3 and mr @entity5			1
the lawsuit also depicts the executive as the brains behind the @entity2 headphones , while casting dr @entity3 and mr @entity5 as little more than figureheads			2
one section of the lawsuit likens mr @entity10 to two more famous innovators , @entity7 co-founder @entity117 and sound - system pioneer @entity118			2
voicemails seeking comment were left for dr @entity3 's attorney and beats by @entity84 on tuesday .			0

in lawsuit , @entity1 ceo @entity10 targets @entity25 , dr @entity3 and @entity5
says co-founders intentionally orchestrated ' sham ' deal with @entity20 in 2011
this deal , he claims , led to termination of @entity1 alliance two years later
mr @entity10 was ' assured that firm would not be sold for at least several years '
but last may , @entity25 was sold to @entity7 - he would have made $ *30m* - $ 150m
@entity9 - based suit also targets @entity20 and @entity61 , beats investor
