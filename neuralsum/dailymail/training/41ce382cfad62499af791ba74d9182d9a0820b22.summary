the current fee for climbing the mountain is £ 15,000 per person - though discounts are available for groups			1
this regime will be replaced with a flat fee of £ 6,600 for every climber			0
@entity20 , the head of @entity3 's @entity21 , said the previous system was dangerous because it encouraged climbers to team up even if they had never climbed before and had different levels of experience			1
' @entity27 's highest garbage dump ' : climbers on @entity6 can find themselves surrounded with discarded equipment problem : this huge haul of discarded oxygen cylinders demonstrates the scale of rubbish dumping on @entity6 intrusion : piles of abandoned climbing gear and human waste has threatened to wipe out the @entity40 eco-system he said : ' we hope to attract more climbers and also at the same time better manage the climbing teams			1
this will allow the smaller teams and individuals more freedom when they climb @entity6			0
' but the increase in footfall on the mountain this may bring could result in even more refuse accumulating on the slopes of @entity6			2
the vast quantities of food wrappers , climbing gear and oxygen cylinders - leading some to dub @entity6 the ' world 's highest garbage dump ' - is so bad it has led to calls to close down the mountain while a clean - up takes place			1

threat : around 50 tones of rubbish is left on @entity6 every climbing season eyesore : just beyond the tourist trail lies a huge rubbish dump , right , some of which has been cleaned up , left tens of thousands of @entity3 hoteliers , trekking guides and porters also depend on climbers and the money they bring			0
@entity3 , which has eight of the 14 highest mountains in the world , is also reducing fees for its other peaks , which were much less expensive to begin with			0

head of country 's @entity21 announced the cut
it is said to increase *safety* by ending practice of climbers grouping together for discounts - despite having different *ability* levels
