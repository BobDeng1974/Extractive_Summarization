by @entity1 reporter published : 20:18 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 07:10 est , 5 january 2014 just over a year ago , @entity6 's heart and organs were giving up , her bones were weak and her reflexes stopped working			1
but rather than surrendering to anorexia , the 18 - year - old checked in to a hospital in september 2012 in a bid to reclaim her life			1
eager to help other people suffering from a crippling eating disorder , the @entity15 teenager used @entity19 to document her difficult road to recovery and show that it ' was possible ' to get better			1
before and after what a difference a year makes : on 5 october 2012 ( left ) , @entity6 said she had ' horrible anxiety ' and felt like 's * * t '			1
but on 18 october 2013 ( right ) , she felt ' amazing ' , she did n't ' fear food ' and she was ' healthy and strong ' ' when i first started @ eatmoveimprove , it was actually called @ fightinganorexia and it was an anonymous account , ' @entity6 told @entity32			1
' it took me a while before i decided to share my identity			0
so i had this account alongside my personal [ @entity19 account ] to track my recovery , and then it grew and changed into what it is today			1
' today , the photo - sharing account is brimming with body - positive messages , photos of @entity6 working out and healthy meals she 's prepared for herself			1
however , her 15 - month journey to recovery was often dark and painful			2
when she was admitted to hospital , @entity6 weighed just 84 pounds and feared she would n't survive another night			2
the @entity19 photos were grim , with pictures of her hospital bed , thin frame and gaunt features			2
the hospital where it all began : on 28 september 2012 , @entity6 posted this - her first picture - to @entity19 , ' so i do n't know for sure yet , but tomorrow i 'm probably being put in # hospital for my # eatingdisorder			1
i just ca n't fight it on my own anymore and it 's gotten really serious and out of hand			0
i 'm anyway considering starting a blog so i can write about my life and my # disorder in a better way , what do you think ? ' her actual hospital bed : on 30 september 2012 , @entity6 posted this picture of her room , ' i have no idea how long i will have to stay but it feels good to be getting # help ' but after two months in hospital , she overcame her demons , developed a healthy eating plan and got her life back on track			1
she said she reached a healthy weight in february 2013			0
now , @entity6 's photo feed shows her posing in the gym , flashing the muscles she 's worked hard for , and the nutritious food she prepares			2
the teenager said the @entity19 account has helped in her battle against anorexia			1
' @entity19 helped me a lot			2
i found other people who felt the same way or were struggling with battles like my own , ' she told @entity32			2
' we supported each other a lot and when i was feeling low i could always turn to my ‘ @entity98 ’ for support and advice			1
' i felt i had a responsibility since i had a lot of followers who looked up to me and saw me as an inspiration … it became very important to me to recover in a good way and to stay healthy			0
to show people that it was possible and worth it			0
' road to recovery shaping up : @entity6 said she was growing to love her body again and was working hard to get in shape , seen in these pictures from 15 april 2013 ( left ) and 10 may 2013 ( right ) @entity6 said the shift from the anonymous @ fightinganorexia to the identifiable @ eatmoveimprove account was important for her recovery			1
' today i do n’t see my account as an inspiration for recovery , but for being recovered , [ for being ] healthy , if you see the difference , ' she said			2
' @entity121 is part of my history and a disease i once had , but it does not define me as a person			0
' today i share my life , what i love to do , and who i am			0
anorexia is not a part of that , but it was , and i still want to be a support and inspiration for people who are struggling			2
' health and fitness gym bunny : @entity6 now spends time working out to build her strength and tone her body , posting these pictures of her sculpted figure around december delicious : @entity6 posts healthy and nutritious meals for her legion of @entity19 followers food porn : @entity6 fills her @entity19 with pictures of healthy foods such as yoghurt , blueberries and vegetables @entity6 also runs a fitness blog , @entity153 , where she answers questions about herself , her health and eating disorders in general			1
but she said she is very careful about what she shares online			0
' people ask how much i weigh or how many calories i eat , and i wo n’t talk about that			0
i do n’t want to share numbers because i know that triggered me , and i do n’t want that to be what my account is about , ' she said			0
' i do post progress pictures , and that took me awhile			1
but followers were asking how my workouts were going so i decided to share more progress pictures — but i ’m quite careful there too : i do n’t talk about my body like i do about my progress			1
it ’s not how i look , it ’s how much energy i have or what i can lift in the gym			0
' i ’ll tell people off when they ask me how to lose weight			0
me losing weight was me almost losing my life			0
you should n’t ask me how to do that			0
that ’s like asking me how to commit suicide			0
' i try to teach people who do n’t understand			0
i ’ll tell them what they doing and asking me is wrong ; an eating disorder is not something to strive for			0
' body confident : @entity6 now is n't embarrassed of her bikini body , which she achieved by eating and drinking healthily fitness blogger : @entity6 answers questions about herself , her life and eating disorders on her blog			1
