criticism : @entity1 went from the @entity2 to a £ 180k @entity4 role the country ’s top woman civil servant is clinging to her £ 180,000 - a - year job after being accused by mps of a ' catastrophic failure of leadership ' on securing @entity12 's borders			1
@entity1 's disastrous tenure in charge of the @entity15 lead to a huge backlog of hundreds of thousands of immigration cases			1
but astonishingly she emerged unscathed and was rewarded with promotion through the civil service and is now in charge of @entity4			2
the powerful home affairs committee today said they were ‘ astounded ’ she was considered suitable for the job of collecting the nation ’s taxes			1
chairman @entity26 hit out at ' incompetent ' mrs @entity1 receiving £ 20,000 in bonuses despite leaving the @entity15 in a ' worst position ' than when she started			1
there were also signs ministers were finally losing faith with the mandarin			0
a senior @entity34 source said : ‘ there are increasing concerns from ministers as to why there are no penalties for poor performance in the civil service			0
instead what we have is a “ promotions - all - round ” culture			0
‘ there needs to be penalties for the worst performers and better career paths for those who are doing well			0
if someone has a terrible track record of delivery , should they really be being promoted ? ‘ the civil service does not do talent management properly			2
’ the select committee accused mrs @entity1 of repeatedly misleading mps and called for @entity58 to be given greater say over appointing of top civil servants			1
the @entity57 said : ‘ it is shocking that after five years under @entity1 ’s leadership an organisation that was described at the beginning of the period as being not fit for purpose should have improved its performance so little			2
‘ given this background , we are astounded mrs @entity1 has been promoted to become chief executive and permanent secretary at @entity4			1
’ @entity15 has been heavily criticised after it emerged backlog would take 24 years to clear born in @entity73 , ms @entity1 studied law at @entity75 , before working at @entity76 for two years then @entity77 , where over a period of 15 years , she rose to the position of director of corporate services			1
this proved the springboard for her first major town hall job , in 1998 , as chief executive of @entity85			0
just four years later , the married mother of three daughters was parachuted into the same post at @entity89 , on a jaw - dropping £ 174,000 - year			2
in 2005 she was accused of throwing ‘ the rule book out of the window ’ in a major postal votes scandal in @entity91 that ended up before the courts			0
election judge @entity95 said fraud in the city ‘ would have disgraced a banana republic ’			0
he described mrs @entity1 ’s decision to allow postal ballot papers to be transported to the count in shopping bags as ‘ the direst folly ’			2
but later that year she was chosen by the @entity104 to run what was then called the @entity106 – this time on £ 200,000 , plus bonuses			1
already in chaos , it was on her watch in 2006 that we learned of the mistaken release of 1,000 foreign criminals			2
it later emerged some 450,000 asylum cases had not been dealt with but left in boxes at the @entity104			2
the new @entity15 was meant to clear up the mess , and mrs @entity1 became its first chief executive , on an astonishing £ 208,000 a year			1
but among a fresh run of scandals was the revelation that nearly 400 of the 1,000 foreign prisoners were told they could stay in @entity12 and dozens remained untraced			0
promotion came again in 2011 when she was handed the the post of permanent secretary at the @entity127 where she stayed for barely a year before winning her biggest job to date – running @entity4			1
since then she has been criticised for failing to tackle tax avoidance , admitting in november last year that over half of @entity12 ’s biggest 770 firms funnel profits overseas			2
in a damning indictment of her abilities , the @entity57 say they can ' have little confidence in her ability to lead @entity4 at what is a challenging time for that organisation '			1
it points out that the woman oversaw a huge backlog in immigration cases at @entity15 has since admitted that her new department at @entity4 left 1million letters unanswered throughout 2012			1
today mr @entity26 insisted senior civil servants involved in the chaos should not be rewarded with new plum jobs			1
' people just ca n’t go on to be promoted to other jobs unless they answer for what ’s happened			0
she has apologised , but we felt that more should have been done , ' he told @entity154			0
ministers were repeatedly not given accurate data on immigration levels			0
' most of this happened under the leadership of @entity1 when she headed the @entity15 for five years , despite getting bonuses of £ 20,000 , ' mr @entity26 added			1
' when she left the organisation , i ’m afraid , it was left it something of a worst position than she arrived			0
we now have a third of a million cases in backlog			2
we should actually rename this agency : @entity173 because of the number of things not dealt with			0
' he added that letters sent by mrs @entity1 to the committee were ' frankly incompetent ' and he had to ' introduce her to pie charts and graphs ' to ensure the information was accurate			1
@entity183 of the @entity184 ’ @entity182 said : ‘ taxpayers are sick to death of senior civil servants presiding over failure only to move on without being held to account for their past actions			0
‘ at worst @entity34 rewards the incompetent with payoffs or promotions , at best it just shuffles them sideways			0
’ but mrs @entity1 has written to mps saying : ‘ it is wholly inaccurate and unfair to seek to ascribe responsibility to me for matters of concern that occurred long after i left the agency			1
’ this is despite @entity57 today warning that border officials require 24 years to clear their backlog of 320,000 immigration cases			1
incompetence and foot - dragging is blamed for the sheer number of claims – the equivalent of the population of @entity211			0
in a blistering report , the @entity213 home affairs committee also said the army of foreign criminals on the streets was growing , with the total now almost 4,000			1
the audit into the work of the @entity15 , which was dubbed not fit for purpose six years ago , found 321,726 outstanding cases involving immigrants			1
these include 28,500 current asylum cases , 4,000 immigration cases and 181,541 people placed in a so - called @entity228			1
the pool comprises migrants who arrived legally but can not now be found after their work or study visas expired			0
officials say many of the migrants will have gone home – a view disputed by the @entity57 , who say the lack of proper border checks may mean ‘ tens of thousands ’ are still here			0
they are highly critical of the slow pace at which officials are clearing the backlog			0
between july and september last year , it was reduced by only 3,430 – or 1 per cent			0
this is despite officials writing off 74,000 cases held in the separate ‘ asylum controlled archive ’ over that period			0
@entity26 , right , said hardly any progress is being made in clearing the backlog , while immigration minister @entity250 , left , said the @entity15 is a ' troubled organisation ' the controlled archive was created to hold what remains of @entity254 ’s asylum backlog			1
it was intended to hold cases that had not been concluded , so they could be reopened if the person was traced			0
@entity15 officials had been tracking them down – but decided to abandon those they could n’t find			2
critics say it amounts to have an effective ‘ amnesty ’			0
@entity26 , the @entity254 mp who chairs the home affairs committee , said hardly any progress was being made in clearing the backlog			1
he holds former @entity15 chief executive @entity1 – @entity12 ’s most senior female mandarin – responsible for much of the debacle			1
she is clinging to her job in charge of @entity4 after mps concluded she was guilty of a ‘ catastrophic ’ failure of leadership during her time at @entity15			1
mr @entity26 said : ‘ no sooner is one backlog closed , than four more are discovered			2
‘ at this rate it will take 24 years to clear the backlog which still stands at the size of the population of @entity211			2
’ also within the backlog are 3,980 foreign criminals who can not be deported and have been released on bail by the courts			0
this has increased by 26 in only three months , despite repeated government promises to kick the offenders out			0
six years ago the asylum backlog scandal prompted then home secretary @entity289 to brand the immigration system ‘ not fit for purpose ’			2
the committee recommends senior @entity15 staff are not paid bonuses until there is evidence the backlog is being ‘ substantially ’ reduced and new backlogs are not emerging			1
@entity299 , @entity254 ’s home affairs spokesman , said : ‘ this highly critical report shows that practical failings in the immigration system are getting worse			1
’ immigration minister @entity250 said : ‘ we have always been clear the @entity15 was a troubled organisation with a poor record of delivery			1
‘ turning it around will take time but i am determined to provide the public with an immigration system they can have confidence in			0
’ the @entity2 has awarded a £ 30million contract to outsourcing firm @entity312 to help track illegals			0
it began work in october .			0

damning report demands to know why @entity1 went from overseeing immigration chaos to running the tax office
a backlog of more than 320,000 immigration cases built up on her watch
but she was promoted to £ 180,000 role running @entity4 , where 1million letters went unanswered last year
home affairs committee says hardly any progress made to clear backlog
chairman @entity26 slams ' incompetent ' @entity331 who got £ 20,000 in bonuses but left @entity15 in worse state than when she started
