by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 17 may 2013 social services are under fire for failing to prevent a 13 - month - old boy being killed by his mother 's boyfriend - despite desperate warnings from his father in the weeks before his death			1
@entity10 was repeatedly being abused by @entity11 , who lived with his mother @entity12			2
when the toddler died in december 2010 , he was covered head - to - toe in 25 bruises			1
death : @entity10 died aged 13 months when he was beaten by his mother 's boyfriend his father @entity18 had complained to officials that the boy was at risk , but they told him they had ' no concerns ' for @entity10 and refused to investigate his care - later saying they were distracted by strategy meetings			1
it has also emerged that @entity12 took her son to a gp when he was having trouble breathing , but ignored the doctor 's advice to visit hospital to treat the bruises on his head			1
a report has criticised child welfare agencies for failing to act on a series of warning signs , and concluded that @entity10 was not ' properly safeguarded ' in the 24 hours leading up to his death			2
although mr @entity10 contacted both social workers and police , his concerns ' do not appear to have been acted on '			2
convicted : the boy 's mother @entity12 , left , was sentenced to a community order over his death , while her boyfriend @entity11 , right , is serving a seven - and - a - half - year jail term the report found that as well as poor communication with the victim 's father , information about the boy 's welfare was recorded inaccurately			1
' the child 's father , who lived with him for the first ten months of his life , and who then cared for him overnight for the final three months of his short life , was not visible , ' it said			2
' he had to ring the social worker , rather than the other way around			0
he expressed concerns to the social worker , police and the @entity66 , but these do not appear to have been acted on			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity68 ( @entity69 ) apologised for the failures and said no one could have predicted @entity10 's death @entity73 , the author of a serious case review for @entity69 , said that on the day of @entity10 's first birthday in november 2010 concerns had been raised when @entity12 contacted medical professionals			1
killer : @entity11 was convicted of manslaughter despite trying to claim that @entity10 's death was an accident she wrote : ' there were sufficient concerns identified on that evening , and on the following day that could and should have triggered a child protection investigation had the totality of the information been considered at a strategy meeting			1
' @entity10 's mother initially said he had stopped breathing but failed to seek help for several hours			1
' @entity10 had a bruise on his forehead			0
his mother arrived at the @entity28 surgery with no warning , and left before the @entity28 could complete the referral to the hospital			2
she then failed to attend hospital as directed			0
' mrs @entity73 said social workers had failed to challenge medical opinions about his injuries , and the meeting with the gp had not been recorded properly			0
senior managers claimed they had not carried out a review of @entity10 's care because ' too many strategy meetings were being held '			1
but mrs @entity73 said the true explanation was ' more subtle ' , and a ' misunderstanding ' meant senior managers had failed to properly safeguard @entity10			0
following the review , in which @entity10 was referred to as ' @entity113 ' , mrs @entity73 said the boy 's death was ' not predictable ' but a ' different course of events ' should have occurred in november 2010			1
@entity118 , chair of @entity69 , said the authority ' wishes to offer its sincere condolences to family members who have been very much a part of this review			0
we thank them for helping us at such a tragic time			0
' she added : ' the review highlighted errors regarding recording of information , issues around poor communication and a lack of robust assessment and professional curiosity and challenge by a number of agencies			0
' there were broader issues in that @entity142 's father and wider family members were not given the opportunity to contribute to assessments in relation to @entity147 ' following a trial at @entity149 , @entity12 , 31 , was found guilty of cruelty and sentenced to a 12 - month community order by mr justice @entity152			2
@entity11 , who lived with @entity12 in @entity153 , @entity154 , claimed he had left the baby in the living room and found him collapsed when he returned			0
he was sentenced to seven and half years in prison for manslaughter after a jury found he had inflicted the fatal injuries .			0
