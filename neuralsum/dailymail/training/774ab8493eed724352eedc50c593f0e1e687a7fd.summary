an @entity1 entrepreuner and a tech ' genius ' have constructed a car from @entity5 - and it can actually be driven on the road			1
the bright yellow hot rod , snappily titled the ' @entity8 ' , was built using 500,000 pieces of @entity5			1
even the air - powered engine is made from standard @entity5 pieces and utilises four orbital engines and a total of 256 pistons			1
it can reach a top speed of 12 - 18mph , although the creators - @entity18 entrepreneur and marketeer @entity17 and @entity21 , a 20 - year - old self - taught ' technology genius ' from @entity23 - do admit they were ' scared of a @entity5 explosion so we drove it slowly '			1
he added : ' what really matters in the world now is n’t so much the new technology			2
it ’s people having access to the technology			2
it ’s about people using their imagination to put things together in ways that people have n’t thought of before			0
that ’s where the real power is			2
' it cost £ 11,200 to build and was crowd - funded by forty @entity1 patrons			1
one of them is blogger @entity53 , who said : ' i think ultimately you get involved with something like this because it ’s such an awesome idea and good things might flow from it			0
' the two men were worried that there would be a ' @entity5 explosion ' if they pushed it too hard uncomfortable : even the steering wheel and pedals are created from @entity5 bricks the wheels , which are one of the few parts not made from @entity5 , feature likenesses of the pair of creators group project : the car was crowd - funded by 40 different technology enthusiasts from @entity1 more than 500,000 @entity5 pieces were used			1
the car engine is made from standard @entity5 pieces and runs on air the engine has four orbital engines and a total of 256 pistons			1
top speed is around 12 - 18mph			2
it was built in @entity23 and shipped to a secret location in suburban @entity18			0
it ’s a @entity89 design , ' mainly because hot rods are cool '			0
the wheels and some load - bearing elements are non-lego			0
the pair met when mr @entity17 reluctantly accepted a random @entity97 request from the @entity23 and from there , their working partnership flourished			0
' he wanted me to connect him with this astronaut i know because he ’s interested in rockets , ' mr @entity17 said			0
' i ’m teaching him about business and he ’s teaching me a bit about physics			0
it ’s a really nice mash - up			0
' it 's not the pair 's first foray into bizarre @entity5 - related projects			1
in late 2011 , the pair sent a small space shuttle made out of @entity5 into space , where it reached an altitude of about 35,000 metres above the earth			1
it landed in the snow near a little village in @entity117 , the country in which it was launched			0
@entity21 retrieved the shuttle using a gps device			0
their initial attempt failed and the space shuttle blew up into thousands of @entity5 pieces as it could n’t withstand the pressure of going into space			1
so for the second successful attempt , @entity21 simply super glued all the pieces together so the shuttle would n’t fly apart as it was buffeted by 124mph winds			2
@entity132 : @entity17 ( right ) and @entity21 , who met on @entity97 and enjoy engineering using @entity5 raw materials : some of the half a million @entity5 pieces used			1
it was built in @entity23 and shipped to @entity1			0

' @entity8 ' can hit 18mph using air power
the project cost £ 11,200 and used 500,000 pieces of @entity5
it was created by an entrepreneur and a young ' technology genius '
