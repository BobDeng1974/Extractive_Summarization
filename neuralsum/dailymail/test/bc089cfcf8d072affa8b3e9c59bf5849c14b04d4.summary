a @entity1 treble is gone , but the recriminations , anger and sense of injustice will linger and fester for some time to come			1
cup defeats to @entity7 are rarely a tranquil affair			1
on a fateful night in @entity10 15 years ago the @entity9 inflicted the first of their damaging , deeply defeats on @entity13 's champions			2
they 've made a habit of it down the years			0
yet in a re-enactment of the night @entity16 went ballistic their players celebrated @entity21 's late , extra-time strike by sliding joyously on their fronts before a small , delirious support			1
@entity21 ( second right ) celebrates with his @entity7 team - mates following his extra-time winner the celebrations continue on the pitch as @entity7 rejoice in reaching the @entity30 final they will be back here in greater number for this club 's first ever @entity30 final against @entity36 – a former club of manager @entity38 - on may 30 where they will be favourites to triumph			1
' that does n't sit nice with me , ' said @entity38 afterwards			0
' i love to be underdogs			0
i love to create a siege mentality			0
' this dogged , energetic @entity7 side – driven on by their man of the match captain @entity43 – perform better as underdogs			2
yet who can dispute they now have an outstanding chance of winning their first major trophy , a mere 21 years since the acrimonious amalgamation which led to their entry to the senior ranks ? before then comes weeks of uproar			0
days of @entity1 anger , finger jabbing and injustice over the standard of officiating here			2
not , it must be said , without justification			0
the standard of @entity63 refereeing remains an ongoing embarrassment			0
supporters of other clubs believe @entity1 have had their share of favourable decisions down the years			2
if that 's true this was a pretty savage slice of karma			2
@entity72 ( centre ) fired @entity1 into an early lead with a superb free - kick in the 18th minute a goal to the good via @entity72 's superb 16th minute free - kick the @entity79 side were denied a clear penalty kick – followed by an @entity7 red card for @entity82 - before half - time			1
@entity1 's @entity85 was deftly played through on goal , his shot parried across goal the face of goal by @entity7 keeper @entity90 , where @entity91 seemed certain to score with a swooping header			1
the hand of @entity82 blocked the ball , yet additional assistant referee @entity96 - standing five yards away – failed to see it through the bodies in his way			1
with @entity82 off and a chance to make it 2 - 0 from 12 yards this could easily have been the @entity1 walkover people expected			1
where @entity7 are concerned , we should all know better			2
four times in the last 15 years they have denied their more feted opponents big victories in league and cups at a critical juncture			0
@entity114 shoots past replacement goalkeeper @entity115 to equalise for @entity7 and the turning point for this latest triumph came in 53 minutes			1
in a bitter , unpalatable irony for @entity1 supporters it came from a penalty			1
and a red card for their keeper @entity123 after he upended @entity125 as he outstripped @entity126 and hared in behind the @entity1 defence			1
the decision to dismiss the @entity1 keeper was correct			1
that the officials had gone this one right – while making such a hash of the first half equivalent – was of no consolation to @entity1 's players and management at time up			1
@entity137 began a slow , menacing trudge towards the other side of the pitch to confront referee @entity141 and his officials			0
his captain @entity143 , making his a little too forcibly , had been dragged away seconds earlier			0
' i did n't say so much , ' said the @entity145			0
' i just asked if he knew what he had done			0
he had n't seen it			0
' @entity72 's post match protestations were strong enough to earn a booking			1
@entity154 gave @entity7 the lead in the 96th minute despite the attention of @entity72 ' everybody of course gets angry , ' added @entity137			1
' but that 's why football is interesting , it 's a tough world , that 's why it 's so hard to get the treble			2
it 's small details that can make you fail and today it was a small detail that made it hard for us			0
' to say so , however , is to overlook a rather large obstacle in @entity1 's way ; @entity7			1
for @entity115 , @entity123 's deputy , the task of keeping @entity114 's penalty out with his first touch was a tall order			1
@entity175 had also been sacrificed in a tactical manoeuvre and suddenly @entity7 , with their one man advantage , had the legs and the running			2
on a diet of three games a week the champions elect looked tired and leggy , their bench options limited			0
with @entity175 gone they were neutered			0
who could have predicted that when they began the game with purpose and intent ? @entity191 smashed a first time right foot shot off the junction of post and bar in 12 minutes			0
four minutes later they took the lead with a superb strike from @entity72			1
@entity200 levels matters in the 116th minute with a well - taken free - kick @entity7 defender @entity202 was booked for a crude - if vital - foul on @entity175 on the edge of the box as the @entity1 winger threatened to use his pace to rampage the @entity7 support			1
@entity72 took the free kick , curling a magnificent right foot effort into the top left hand corner of off the inside of the post			1
on league duty last week @entity7 had recovered from the loss of an early goal and so it was here			1
in last season 's @entity221 defeat to @entity223 in @entity10 the team in blue stood accused of being dour and unadventurous			0
the same could n't be said here			0
whatever the @entity1 injustices , they can hardly deny their opponents played to devastating effect on the break			1
they should have been out of the game by half - time			2
yet their captain @entity43 had an outstanding game , proving the man of the match			0
when the highlanders equalised they were the stronger sharper team			0
a weary @entity1 clung on slightly for extra-time			2
and in 95 minutes it seemed they were broken when @entity43 's cross from the left touchline ricocheted off the knee of @entity125 into the path of striker @entity244			1
the @entity245 , who had blown a golden opportunity to level in the first half , guided his shot low and true past the outstretched left hand of @entity115			2
@entity123 might have made the save			2
in every sense @entity1 looked weak and vulnerable now			2
they were n't out of it completely			0
@entity1 players stand dejected on the pitch following their 3 - 2 loss in a personal disaster for @entity7 stand - in keeper @entity90 – who had enjoyed a fine game beforehand – allowed a swirling @entity200 free - kick to bounce over his outstretch hands and into the net for 2 - 2 12 minutes into extra-time			1
@entity7 could – should have had a second penalty when the unconvincing @entity115 clattered his fists into the back of @entity244 in 108 minutes			1
but they would n't be denied			0
with four minutes of extra-time to play			0
@entity21 , castigated by his manager before extra-time , slammed the ball into the net from an acute angle after more outstanding work by @entity43 , driving into the area and hammering the ball across the face of goal			1
' coming into extra time he was sitting down , ' said @entity38 in some disgust afterwards			0
' i grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and told him to stand up because sitting down is , for me , a sign of weakness in those circumstances			0
' such was the @entity7 strength that @entity1 were done			1
their upporters drifted away silently , but in the days to come they will have plenty to say			0
and for @entity13 's referees there will be no avoiding the din .			0

@entity72 gave @entity1 the lead with a superb free - kick
@entity82 escaped a red card just before the break for a hand ball
@entity1 keeper @entity123 was sent off early in the second half
@entity114 's penalty and @entity244 put @entity7 ahead
@entity200 equalised , but @entity21 had the final say
