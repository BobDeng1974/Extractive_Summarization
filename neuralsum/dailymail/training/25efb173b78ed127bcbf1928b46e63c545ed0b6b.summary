researchers have been left baffled as hundreds of sick and starving sea lion pups continue to wash up on @entity3 beaches in what is proving to be a particularly deadly winter for the pinnipeds			1
in january , rescuers netted more than 250 frail pups from @entity9 to @entity10 , mostly seven - month - olds that should have been nursing with their mothers in the @entity13 or @entity14			1
although this is the third year of mass die - offs of pups , the 2015 figures are the worst so far			1
they have even prompted the @entity20 to declare a rare ' unusual mortality event '			0
the reason behind the increasing die - offs is unknown			1
many scientists believe warmer - than - average waters are forcing mother sea lions to venture farther out for food , leaving their offspring behind			1

recovery : the reason behind the increasing die - offs is unknown			1
many scientists believe warmer - than - average waters are forcing mother sea lions to venture farther out for food , leaving their offspring behind returning to the sea : @entity3 sea lions @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 - that were rescued in an undernourished state - return to the ocean at @entity96 in @entity97 after receiving care at @entity57 left by its mother ? some say the fish the seals eat may be feeding farther from the islands than in the past , leading to the same problem			1

' meanwhile , more than 50 malnourished sea lion pups have been placed in a holding pen at @entity34 since the beginning of the year after being rescued on beaches along the city 's coast			2
' when they came in , they could n't raise their heads , so to see them start grooming and barking , that means they 're feeling much better , much more themselves , ' @entity126 vet dr. @entity125 said			0

' the pups are desperate and starving , so they just jump in the water and swim and get pulled to the coastline , ' said @entity164 , director of veterinary medicine for the @entity57			0
speaking to sfgate , she added : ' this is the third year that we ’ve seen these mass die - offs , but this is the worst so far			1
if this continues , there will be some long - term effects on the sea lion population			0
' @entity178 , stranding network coordinator for @entity177 , said the population of sea lions might have reached its capacity in the animals ' environment , sparking the mass die - offs			1
a welcome meal : a rescued @entity3 sea lion pup enjoys a fish during feeding time at @entity34 swimming : despite the die - offs , sea lions in @entity3 have been relatively healthy in recent decades , with the population at 300,000 today			1

in january , over 250 pups rescued from @entity9 to @entity10
most were seven - month - olds that should have been nursing with moms
this is third year of mass die - offs , but 2015 figures are the worst so far
many scientists think unusually warm waters in @entity3 are to blame
these were forcing mother sea lions to venture father into sea for food
pups - who do not wean off mothers until 10/11 months - are left behind
