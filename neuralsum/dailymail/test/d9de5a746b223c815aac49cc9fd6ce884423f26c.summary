@entity0 has launched an impassioned defence of his abilities , insisting there is nobody better equipped to manage @entity5 under the @entity7 model			1
it has been a difficult week for @entity0 , with the meek manner of last sunday ’s 2 - 1 defeat by @entity11 in the @entity13 semi-final ensuring his position has come under scrutiny like at no point during his three - year reign at the club			1
@entity7 , @entity5 ’s owners , maintain @entity0 ’ job is not even up for discussion but that has not stopped @entity24 – who will leave @entity25 at the end of the campaign – being mentioned as a possible successor			1
@entity0 insists he is the man to guide @entity5 to success despite a disappointing season the @entity5 manager is under pressure following the @entity13 semi-final defeat by @entity11 last sunday but @entity0 has been boosted by the news that @entity36 ( left ) has committed his future to the club but @entity0 has not been rattled by the intensity of the criticism nor is he dwelling on the disappointment			1
he is concentrating on building @entity5 back up and wants the club to be ' really forceful ' when they embark on their summer recruitment drive			1
‘ after the weekend there is always emotion , ’ said @entity0 , who will again be without @entity43 at @entity44 and is ' unsure ' when he will return			1
‘ when you lose a big game this is when you find out you are at a big club because the critics come after you			2
‘ three months ago , i was a tactical genius			2
now i have lost a couple of games and it is not so good			2
‘ that is something you have to deal with			0
when i sit down and look at it , i will hold myself up against anyone to manage this club and to fit the model of what they ( @entity7 ) want			1
i am super ambitious in terms of wanting to win and there will be no greater place to do that than here			0
‘ of course in modern football there are lots of processes that go on behind the scenes that people will never be aware of			0
in terms of what we are trying to do , i do not see anyone better in terms of the hand we were given			0
we are here to win			0
we do not want to be “ nearly men ”			0
‘ there is no - one more ambitious			0
if there comes a time when that is not the case and we move on , there will be no - one who respects the owners more than me			2
but @entity90 , no , i will fight for my life			0
if i can get the tools here to help us , we can be really successful			0
’ @entity36 ( left ) is ' over the moon ' after signing new long - term contract at @entity95 worth over £ 100,000 a week the former @entity97 player hopes @entity98 ( pictured ) will follow his lead and commit his future @entity5 have identified a number of targets , principally @entity104 ’s @entity103 but they must trump @entity105 ; @entity107 striker @entity106 and @entity109 ’s @entity108 are attractive @entity111 options but the feeling is the club need to make a statement of intent			1
‘ we ’ve enough potential and players we can develop and improve , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but it is definitely starters we need and we have to be really forceful to get ( them )			0
’ there was some good news for @entity0 after @entity36 completed the formalities of signing his new five - year contract , which is heavily incentivised and worth more than £ 100,000 per week			1
@entity5 ’s vice captain said he was ' over the moon ' to conclude the talks , which began at the start of the season and were successfully negotiated by his agent , @entity130			2
he now hopes @entity98 will follow suit and commit to @entity5 ’s future like him , @entity43 and @entity133			1
@entity98 , who told @entity135 criticism of his contract talks have been going ' in one ear and out the other ' , will resume negotiations at the end of the season			1
‘ @entity98 is a good friend of mine and he just has to do what he thinks is best , ’ said @entity36			1
‘ but , if i was giving him advice , i would say : " this is @entity5 " – i think this is best place for him			2
that decision is up to him			0
he is a fantastic player for us			0
i hope he stays here and develops with us			0
