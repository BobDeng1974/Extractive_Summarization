by @entity0 for @entity1 it is amazing that photographer @entity3 had any volunteers for his latest studio project			1
but the wedding lensman from @entity7 managed to persuade 100 people to get shot with a stun gun for his @entity11 , and the result is an incredible series of images capturing real , raw emotion			1
' as a portrait photographer , i am always trying to make people feel comfortable in front of my camera so i can capture a real emotion from them			1
but what if i was able to make people feel so uncomfortable in front of the camera that i could guarantee an interesting portrait every time ? ' he says of the idea behind his latest series			1
' the photographer required each subject to receive the 300,000 volt shock from their friend or significant other , who often appeared to enjoy inflicting pain on their loved one , creating ' an interesting dynamic in itself '			1
' the emotions on both sides of the @entity11 were extremely entertaining to watch , ' he writes			2
' the person getting tased was almost always nervous and jittery with either a sense of fear or anxiety			0
the participants doing the tasing had a different demeanor altogether			0
' most of them were excited to cause pain to their friend and only showed remorse immediately after executing the shock			0
' the @entity65 wanted to try something new and to make people feel so uncomfortable in front of the camera that he could guarantee an interesting portrait with every frame a few people looked like they were experiencing pleasure , some jumped and some fell to the ground in an extra twist , the photographer required each subject to receive the 300,000 volt shock from their friend or significant other @entity3 explained that the partners appeared to enjoy inflicting pain on their loved ones , creating ' an interesting dynamic ' @entity3 recorded both of these reactions and edited them into a nail - biting slow motion video , and a behind the scenes clip illustrating the project , adding : ' what i found most interesting about the reactions people showed while getting tased was you never knew how they would react			1
' some people screamed while others were quiet			0
a few people looked like they were experiencing pleasure while others had the most painful faces i 've ever seen			0
i saw jumpers and fallers			0
people laughed and people cursed			0
' find out more on @entity3 's website			2
