by @entity0 published : 03:56 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 06:45 est , 10 july 2013 a cluster of towering concrete blocks that loom over @entity4 's @entity3 will now join a list of national treasures , as they 've been awarded @entity9 listed status			1
@entity11 's @entity10 , has been branded ' soulless ' and one of the ' worst examples of post-war development '			1
but that has not stopped heritage minister @entity16 giving the building the prestigious award			2
once branded ' soulless ' , the building has now been given special status because of its high caliibre design the influential architect , who was renowned for his ' austere ' projects , angered @entity25 author @entity24 so much with his designs that the novelist named one of his most famous villains after him			1
@entity24 had been among the many unhappy objectors to the pre-war demolition of some @entity33 cottages which were removed to make way for @entity11 's house in @entity36			1
@entity11 considered the @entity10 one of his most significant achievements the @entity40 - born architect threatened to sue who @entity11 was published in 1959 , which prompted @entity24 to threaten to rename the character ' @entity44 ' , but eventually he climbed down and dropped his threat			1
built between 1959 and 1967 and originally called @entity10 , the south @entity4 block housed the @entity47 until 1989			1
but the office block became known as sick building syndrome - where inhabitants suffer health problems linked to spending time inside it - and staff were moved out in the early 1990s to a new headquarters across the road			2
it remained empty and was considered for demolition , but it was converted to residential use in 2002			2
the @entity60 said : ' his monumental 1959 - 1963 scheme for @entity3 in south @entity4 is frequently cited as one of the worst examples of soulless post-war developments			1
' but this has n't stopped @entity67 advising that the structure should not enjoy protected status			2
@entity16 said : @entity11 considered this to be his most significant work			1
' acclaimed when it was first built , it subsequently divided opinion but has now – 25 years after first being put forward for listing – clearly passed the test of time			0
' i am pleased now to be able to give it the recognition it deserves			0
@entity82 was named after the architect , who incurred the wrath of @entity24 with his austere designs @entity87 , chief executive of @entity67 said : ' built by distinguished architect @entity11 , @entity10 is an excellent example of high calibre post-war architecture			1
' an accomplished building , it has proved highly influential for designs which followed			2
@entity93 took years for @entity94 - and especially those living there - to warm to it ' we are pleased that the heritage minister agrees with our advice and has listed it at @entity9 @entity9 buildings are nationally important and of special interest ; 92 per cent of all listed buildings are in this class and it is the most likely grade of listing for a home owner			0
however there is some hope for those who view the block as a blot , rather than a treasure - listing does not protect the building			0
instead , it means that listed building consent must be applied for in order to make any changes to that building which might affect its special interest			0
listed buildings can be altered , extended and sometimes even demolished within government planning guidance			0
an influential figure in the @entity124 modern movement , @entity11 studied architecture in @entity126 , the @entity60 said			1
but his works would often divide residents and critics ' opinions			0
he moved to @entity4 in 1934 , attracting praise for some projects , notably his @entity33 home , but drawing controversy for ambitious schemes at @entity3 and @entity136			0
the @entity93 in west @entity4 , is a prime example of his provoking work			0
popular though @entity140 is today , it took years for @entity94 – and especially those living there – to warm to it , and other @entity145 projects proved equally contentious .			0

@entity11 's @entity10 , has been branded ' soulless '
designs angered author @entity24 so he named a villain after architect
