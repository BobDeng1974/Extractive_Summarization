@entity0 , 17 , of @entity1 , is believed to be the first transgender @entity2 lookalike packs of screaming girls and young fans asking for pictures are now an everyday occurrence for @entity0			1
the 17 - year - old is a @entity2 look - a - like and these moments do more than just provide the college student with a taste of what life is like for his idol			1
for @entity0 the recognition provides him with hope and a lightness that has been missing from his life - for the teenager was actually born a girl named @entity22			1
his decision to switch gender and live his life as a boy has seen him on and off the police protection list for five years due to a campaign of abuse that has seen him beaten unconscious and his house pelted with rocks , snowballs and metal poles			1
he has even attempted to kill himself in a bid to escape his tormentors			0
but @entity0 said yesterday he finds comfort in impersonating @entity2 , 20 , and that the @entity38 pop star ’s music has given him the confidence to be himself			1
it is believed @entity0 is @entity41 ’s first transgender @entity2 look - a - like			1
a person is transgender if they believe the body they were born with does not match how they feel as an individual			2
@entity0 said he has known he was a boy from a very young age and has now decided to undergo surgery and hormone treatment to change his body from that of a girl to that of a boy			1
he said : ‘ i was born a boy but my body reflects differently because i ’ve not had the op yet			2
i knew at quite a young age because i was always copying my brother and doing what he was doing and i just did n’t feel right			0
’ his mother @entity62 , 52 , also noticed early on that something did n’t seem right			0
she said : ‘ i knew there was something because i would try and dress him up , not thinking and doing his hair with girly things			0
he would say i do n’t like this and i would tell him it looks good and he would go along with it but he was never really happy			0
i knew there was something but i could never put my finger on it			0
even then he would come home and take the girl clothes off and put on football , @entity81 , stuff			2
’ after coming across @entity2 on @entity84 when he was 12 , @entity0 , who lives with @entity62 and his older brother @entity83 in @entity1 , said he felt an immediate connection with the singer and his lyrics			1
he picked out the song believe as summing up how @entity2 inspires him , highlighting the words ‘ it did n’t matter how many times i got knocked on the floor ’ because : ‘ i ’ve had physical abuse and hate but @entity2 ’s words bring me back up again ’			2
he has since worked hard perfecting the likeness , closely studying music videos and interviews to memorise @entity2 ’s mannerisms and spending hundreds of pounds on clothing , sometimes spending days trawling the internet to find versions of the singer ’s outfits at affordable prices			1
however , the work has paid off and he is often mistaken for the real @entity2			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve had my shades on and my hat backwards and i went into @entity117 and a small girl came up and her mum asked if she could have her picture taken with me because she thought i really was @entity2			2
and , when i went to @entity121 , these girls on the escalators were going crazy because they thought i was him			0
’ @entity0 has spent hours impersonating the star to copy his mannerisms and said he now gets mistaken for him he was born @entity22 but realised he was transgender and changed his name by deed poll at the age of 16 however , these highlights are far from the usual reaction and @entity0 has endured years ’ of abuse from people who wo n’t accept him			1
@entity62 has been forced to ring the police ‘ hundreds of times ’ because of different incidents			0
he has been forced to change school twice because of bullying and was once beaten unconscious by a girl who thought @entity0 was attracted to her			1
while he was left in need of medical attention she was only suspended for one day			0
on other occasions his house has been pelted with rocks , snowballs and even a metal pole that cracked the front window while @entity0 was sitting just inside			2
and while both @entity62 , who is a full time carer to her mother who is recovering from breast cancer , and his brother @entity83 , 19 , are both accepting of @entity0 ’s identity , other members of his family have been less supportive			2
@entity0 is due to start gender re-assignment surgery and is believed to be the first transgender @entity2 lookalike @entity0 says impersonating @entity2 has helped him dealing with the bullying and abuse he has suffered the teenager , pictured as @entity22 at five months old at his christening ( left ) and at 10 ( right ) came out as transgender at 16 and has passed the psychological tests and will start taking testosterone before surgery he said : ‘ it ’s been terrible with my dad , he used to call me by my own name and not @entity166 and he ’s not got me anything for my birthday or @entity169			1
we do n’t see each other any more , he ’s got a new girlfriend			0
he ’s asked my mum why i do n’t dress more girly and told her it ’s embarrassing to be seen out with me			0
’ he has not seen his father for nearly two years			0
@entity0 , who came out as transgender at 16 and changed his name by deed poll , said this repeated rejection led to an attempt to take his own life			1
already self - harming , four years ago he went further , huddling in the corner clutching a knife saying he did not want to live anymore			0
@entity62 had to call the police as she did not know how to talk him down			0
@entity0 has been asked for his autograph and to pose for photos in @entity121 after being mistaken for @entity2 he spends hours copying the child star 's moves and trawling the internet to buy similar clothes and shoes however , he said turning to @entity2 has helped him work through some of these issues , to the point where he is now able to give advice to others who are struggling with their own sexuality			1
he said : ‘ now i help people			0
there ’s a group online where people can post online about when they start their operations or when they start [ taking testosterone ] or recent pictures before and after and i know quite a few people who are going through it			0
' some people come to me asking how they should come out to someone			0
it feels good to help others			0
’ his mother added : ‘ they are saying he ’s an inspiration			0
there was a boy whose little sister was sick , she was only three and dying from cancer , and he asked if @entity0 would take a picture of himself looking like @entity2 and put her name on and he said “ thank you so much , it meant everything			1
” ’ @entity0 is currently in the process of gender re-assignment and plans to get tattoos to complete the likeness currently studying public services at college , @entity0 hoped to join either the army or the fire service before deciding to try and make a career as a lookalike			1
these are professions he will go back to if he impersonating @entity2 does n’t go to plan			2
his current aim is to land jobs either modelling as @entity2 or performing at children ’s parties			2
having passed the psychological evaluation necessary before undergoing gender reassignment surgery , he is now scheduled to begin taking testosterone before eventually having the full procedure			1
he hopes these next steps will help him look more masculine and therefore more like @entity2 and plans to get tattoos and build muscle at the gym to make himself more like the star .			2
