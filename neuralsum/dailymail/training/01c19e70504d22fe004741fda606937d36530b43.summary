as far as @entity1 was concerned , he was only returning his neighbour ’s property to its rightful place			2
but when he scooped up a deposit left on his lawn by next door ’s cat @entity9 and hurled it over the garden fence , he can not have imagined the nightmare it would trigger			2
first there was a doorstep confrontation with neighbour @entity15 who claimed there had been more than one missile and pointed out forcefully that one of them had come to rest on his garden table			2
fight : @entity15 , pictured left leaving @entity21 , fought with @entity1 , right , after mr @entity1 threw poo from mr @entity15 's cat into the latter 's garden , where his daughter found it battleground : mr @entity1 , who lives at the house on the right , was fed up with the cat belonging to mr @entity15 , who lives on the left , fouling his lawn then the showdown became physical			1
blood was drawn as the two men wrestled outside their £ 250,000 homes in @entity37 , @entity38 , and ‘ clashed heads ’			1
finally , it ended in court , with mr @entity1 , 60 , facing a charge of assault			1
he was cleared after a day - long trial this week			0
the father of two told magistrates : ‘ the cat comes in and uses the garden as a toilet			2
‘ i went out to cut the grass and i scooped it up and lobbed it over the fence			0
i did n’t think anything more about it			0
‘ i know it was their cat			0
i just threw it – that was it			0
i did n’t really think about it to be honest			0
i agree the sensible thing to do would have been to go and speak to the owners			0
i have never spoken to them about it			0
’ he admitted throwing the poo back over the fence was ‘ not the appropriate thing to do ’ and ‘ quite irrational ’ , but added : ‘ i did n’t expect anyone to come round at all to be honest			0
i was quite shocked when he did come to my door			0
’ the fight between mr @entity1 and @entity15 , 38 , was eventually broken up by mr @entity15 ’s wife @entity71 , who lodged a complaint with police			1
she alleged that 5ft 7in mr @entity1 had head - butted her 6ft 4in husband			1
but the 60 - year - old was cleared of any wrongdoing after magistrates failed to agree that the clash of heads was deliberate			2
drama : @entity82 court heard how the fight was broken up by mr @entity15 's wfie the court heard how the dispute escalated on august 5 last year when mr @entity15 returned to his home with his two children			1
when he opened the patio doors to allow them to play in the garden his five - year - old daughter discovered it was littered with cat poo			2
mr @entity15 cleared up the mess but did not confront his neighbour until his wife came home two hours later			1
mrs @entity98 , 37 , said : ‘ i came home and my husband said my daughter had witnessed what she thought was mud on the garden table			1
‘ he said he went out to the garden and looked at it and realised it was cat faeces covered in grass , and realised it must have been thrown on to our table			0
‘ he was not aggressive , he was quite shocked and surprised by the situation			0
’ she said she urged her husband to speak to their neighbour because if their daughter ‘ had touched this it could have blinded her ’			0
‘ mr @entity1 admitted it straight away , ’ mrs @entity98 told @entity37 magistrates ’ court			1
‘ he said , “ yes , i did throw the cat poo over the hedge			0
i am fed up of the cat coming in my garden ”			2
’ both men claimed to have been ‘ speaking normally ’ when the confrontation began and each blamed one another for starting the fight			0
mr @entity1 alleged his neighbour prodded him forcefully in the chest before starting to ‘ grapple ’ with him on the doorstep			1
mr @entity15 claimed the 60 - year - old head - butted him as soon as he raised the issue of the cat faeces , causing him to restrain his neighbour through fear of another attack			1
the court heard they smashed heads , slicing the skin on the bridge of mr @entity15 ’s nose and injuring mr @entity1 ’s forehead			1
magistrates cleared mr @entity1 of assault by beating after a trial on monday			1
@entity150 , chairman of the bench , said : ‘ we find any contact of heads was accidental in the course of the struggle that occurred between the parties			0
’ last night mrs @entity98 said the family had not let three - year - old @entity9 out since the incident			1
another neighbour said ‘ nearly everyone else in the street ’ except mr @entity1 has cats .			1

@entity1 , 60 , threw poo from @entity15 's cat into his garden
mr @entity1 had become fed up with the cat fouling his lawn
the two fought after mr @entity15 discovered the poo in his garden
they drew blood as they smashed heads outside their £ 250,000 homes
mrs @entity98 alleged that mr @entity1 *headbutted* her husband
