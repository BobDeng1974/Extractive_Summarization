deaths in @entity1 and @entity2 rose by almost a quarter in just month , shocking new figures showed today			1
more than 60,000 people died in january , the highest figure for any month recorded in almost a decade			1
the sharp rise in deaths was linked to the spread of flu and cold weather by the @entity11			1

' however , @entity33 sources stressed it was too early to be certain about what had caused the dramatic rise in the number of deaths			2
the @entity11 publishes data going back to january 2006 , when there were 49,005 people died in @entity41 and @entity2			1
the number of deaths usually peak in december and january , in part as a result of falling temperatures			2

the gold standard was last achieved the week ending september 28 , 2014			0
but the figures , released by @entity41 , did show a step in the right direction			0
the previous week just 86.7 per cent of those patients attending @entity18 were seen within four hours			0
experts said it was a further sign of the ' unprecedented ' pressures facing the health service this winter			0
a whistleblower warned last month that the @entity15 helpline was putting lives at risk as there are too few staff to cope with demand .			0
