no need to tell @entity1 what a difference a year makes			1
twelve months ago he stood on the same spot on the same practice ground at the same tournament , the @entity5 , looking as crestfallen as i have ever seen him			2
there ’s an obvious contentment as he hits a few shots and breaks off to chat with his long - time caddie , @entity12			2
he ’s taking in the surroundings with the grateful bearing of a man handed an unlikely lifeline			2
in short , here ’s a three - time major champion who ’s got his mojo back			1
three time major winner @entity1 has rediscovered his form ahead of the masters the @entity23 practices during the pro-am before the start of the @entity5 in @entity26 the small miracles that occur in this game			1
a month ago @entity1 had fallen outside the world ’s top 300 when he accepted an invitation to play in the @entity32 in @entity33			1
he ended up winning his first tournament in @entity35 since the 2008 @entity36			1
how on earth does that happen ? first , let ’s return to the depths of despair			2
‘ last year ? yeah i was devastated , there ’s no other word for it , ’ he admits			1
‘ i thought all along i ’d do something that would get me to the masters			1
a year earlier i ’d been in contention to win and now i was n’t good enough even to start			2
it was a huge shock			2
’ it was the first major championship this century for which he ’d failed to qualify and he ended up watching it sulking on the sofa at home			1
‘ it was very tough , ’ he says			0
‘ i watched it all and it was n’t nice			0
even though i was out of form , you always think you have a chance at any major , so i was gutted to miss out			2
’ @entity1 had falled out of the world 's top 300 before accepting an invitation to the @entity32 the 43 - year - old ended up winning the tournament after a play - off victory against @entity67 he looked for all the world like he would miss out this year as well until that dramatic play - off victory in the @entity33			1
the spoils of success included an invitation to @entity73			1
ask him about next week and he sounds like a kid who ’s just discovered chocolate			0
‘ i feel like i ’m going to play in the masters for the first time , i ’m that excited , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s funny , all my family are going this year , while in other years it was , like : “ ah , not to worry , we ’ll wait and go another year			2
” now that i ’ve missed one they ’re fearing this will be the last time they will have the chance			0
‘ as a player , a bit of that creeps in as well			0
when you ’re playing great you think you ’re never going to miss these events			0
but hopefully i shall play well for a while now			0
that ’s been my thing over the years			0
it ’s always been about peaks and troughs and keeping the peaks for as long as you can			0
my wins tend to come together so hopefully i ’ll win a few more now			0
’ @entity1 was ' devastated ' after failing to qualify for last year 's masters following poor results the @entity103 kisses the famous @entity104 after winning the @entity105 at @entity106 @entity1 's recent upturn in form began after winning the @entity109 at the end of last year two of his wins together were the @entity5 and @entity36 in 2008			1
so , as the last player to go to @entity73 looking for a third straight major victory , how does he rate @entity116 ’s chances ? ‘ the good thing is that expectation is already at saturation point , so i don ’ t think that will be an issue , ’ he said			1
‘ every week he ’s the main man so he ’s used to it			0
i think the main issue for @entity116 is that so many other players are playing so well			1
@entity116 ’s big thing was that he ’d hit a driver everywhere while most players would hit three wood			1
and he ’d hit it straight so that made him not just long but doubly long			0
but @entity127 does the same thing – and he ’s 20 yards longer than @entity116			1
‘ having said that , @entity116 has shown when he has his a game he wins			1
i ’d go there with the attitude that if i win the @entity101 next year it ’ll still be the career grand slam			2
he ’s just got to try and stay out of his own way as much as he possibly can			0
’ @entity1 , of course , knows all about this mental side of the game , having read every volume on the subject			1
@entity116 heads to @entity73 looking to complete a grand slam of winning all four majors the world no 1 faces competition from @entity127 and his mammoth drives last summer he started working with @entity151 , the renowned psychologist who helped @entity153 ’s cycling team to glory and is now working with @entity155 and @entity156			1
@entity1 was one of the 200,000 people who bought @entity151 ’s book ‘ @entity159			1
’ basically , it ’s about how to manage your inner chimp - the part of the brain that runs on emotions and gut instincts			0
‘ he has really helped me out , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ he ’s helped me rediscover some essential truths about my game			0
i ’d lost my confidence in my ability to read greens , for example , whereas before i thought there was no - one i ’d rather read a 10ft putt to win a major			2
so that huge change in belief led to a lot of tentative strokes			0
‘ as for my inner chimp , well he ’s not angry			0
i do n’t throw clubs or lose my temper			0
he ’s an introvert , but he ’s very devious			0
he needs a lot of reassuring and he was definitely doing a lot of damage			0
but rediscovering those essential truths have helped me put my chimp back in his box			0
’ and long may he keep him there			0
@entity1 has been working with @entity151 ( left ) who has also worked with @entity194 's @entity156 team			1
