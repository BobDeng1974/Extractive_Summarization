a classic @entity0 has become the most expensive car ever sold in @entity2 after changing hands for an estimated £ 24 million			1
the 1957 prototype of the @entity5 won high - profile races and competed twice at @entity7 , the oldest active car race in the world			1
it has now been sold to a so - far anonymous enthusiast - and the price is understood to be three times what was paid for a @entity5 in 2009			1
just popping to the shops : this @entity5 has sold for an estimated £ 24 million , smashing the @entity2 record			1
it was raced by @entity18 world champion @entity19 and competed at the world 's oldest car race mid-life crisis ? the car features leather seating , an original steering wheel and only reasonable wear and tear hailed by an expert as one of the five best ferraris in the world , the model was also raced by the @entity18 world champion @entity19			1
it was previously owned by the millionaire investor @entity35 until he was persuaded to sell it to @entity39 dealer @entity37 mr @entity37 revealed he has now sold the @entity0 , but would n’t confirm the exact selling price			1
however , well - placed sources said the anonymous buyer paid in excess of £ 24.1 million - making it the most expensive car ever sold publicly			2
the highest was previously the £ 22.5 million paid in 2012 for a @entity46 , also owned by mr @entity35			2
the @entity5 achieved the record figure because of its looks , racing pedigree , rarity and the fact is in ' unmolested ' - completely original - condition			2
another @entity5 was sold in 2011 at a @entity53 auction for £ 10 million ( $ 16.4 million ) , but they were both far inferior examples to the latest model			2
the specialist dealer , who sold his first supercar at the age of 11 , said : ' i can confirm that the car has sold , although due to client confidentiality we will not disclose the buyer or the price achieved			0
' this @entity0 is without question one of the most important cars on the planet if not the most important because of its originality			0
' while i wo n’t go into the terms of the sale , i am sure it will prove to be a great investment for the new owner			0
legendary : chassis 0704 remained a favourite of @entity0 designer @entity79 until his death aged 91 ' now it is done , my only disappointment is the fact i do n’t think it can ever be bettered as i truly think it is the greatest car in the world			1
' the model sold was the second prototype and factory team car for two seasons with @entity0 , when then made a further 19 customer cars			1
top spec : the v12 engine helps the car achieve 0 - 60 in about six seconds , spellbinding for its day known as @entity76 , it was designed by legendary @entity0 pioneer @entity79 and was one of his favourite models up until his death aged 91			1
at the 1957 @entity7 race the prototype ran as high as second position but did not finish the race			0
the next year , however , chassis 0704 picked up two wins - in the 1,000km @entity105 and 12 hour @entity107 races - with @entity18 legends @entity19 and @entity109 behind the wheel in both			1
it was later sold to a @entity53 customer and was driven to victory in 16 races on the other side of the @entity116			0
in 1967 the car was donated to the @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 , where it stayed for 30 years			0
@entity0 historian @entity121 described the prototype as ' one of the top five ferraris on the planet '			1
he added : ' it is so valuable because it is totally unmolested and not restored , genuine and very original			0
it also comes with a fantastic history which is most important			0
' i believe the @entity0 market will continue to go up as more and more wealthy people need to reinvest their cash but there are not many more top quality cars available			2
' it ’s simple supply and demand			0
classic cars as hard assets are just one of several asset classes nowadays			0
' the @entity143 index , which tracks the market , estimates the classic @entity0 market has increased fourfold over the past decade			0
this has seen savvy investors and car collectors ploughing their cash into the classic market which is seen by some as safer and more profitable than stocks and shares - not to mention more fun			0
relic : in 1967 it was donated to the @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 , where it stayed for 30 years mystery : so far the car 's owner is anonymous , though that is unlikely to last if it gets driven around town			2
