' not only will you have to live with the physical symptoms including blindness in your right eye , but it is clear that the trauma of that and of witnessing the death of a number of your fellow soldiers has caused you to suffer from significant psychological damage ’			2
but the judge said that while @entity6 , who was medically discharged from the @entity69 last april , had acknowledged that he had problems controlling his temper , by ceasing his therapy he had ‘ failed to alleviate that risk ’			1
he was initially arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm			2

he said : ' i remember getting hit in the face with something and i remember shouting and swearing			0
