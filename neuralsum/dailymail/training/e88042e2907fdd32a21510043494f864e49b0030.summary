officials are drawing up plans to try to entice back nurses who left ten or 20 years ago to start families or pursue different careers			0
new figures show the @entity2 is short of 12,500 nursing posts with many hospitals struggling to recruit highly trained , senior staff			1
the push for older nurses comes as critics say modern nursing training creates nurses with degrees who are ‘ too posh to wash ’ patients - although nursing unions fiercely reject the claim			1
concerns have also been raised that nurses with university degrees lack hands - on experience in care as they have spent too much time in the classroom			1
@entity33 , the body in charge of recruitment , is preparing to launch a campaign to encourage back ex-nurses which is likely to include attractive pay - rates and flexible working			0
many of these nurses may not have worked in the @entity2 for more than 20 years having qualified in the 1980s - without a degree - and subsequently left to start a family			1
meanwhile a new report shows that 83 per cent of @entity2 trusts are short of nurses with the @entity2 estimated to be down on 12,566 posts over all			1
a survey by @entity50 - which represents managers - also shows that on average 1 in 10 posts are vacant at hospitals also at some having more than 100 are empty			1
professor @entity54 , managing director of @entity55 , who is overseeing the plans said : ‘ where trusts do have shortages of nurses , it is often those with experience that they need most			2
‘ attracting nurses back to practice has the potential to address current shortages			0
‘ the next phase of our work will involve designing an efficient process to ensure the success of any campaign encouraging nurses to return to practice			0
‘ preventing staff leaving is equally important and also requires focus and attention			0
’ last week the @entity2 watchdog @entity78 recommended that all wards should have a minimum of one nurse for every patient otherwise safety will be put at risk			2
but unions say this is simply unachievable given the current shortage of nurses			0
last week the @entity2 watchdog @entity78 recommended that all wards should have a minimum of one nurse for every patient otherwise safety will be put at risk the @entity50 report , published yesterday , also revealed that nearly half of hospitals have recruited nurses from abroad in the last 12 months including from @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			1
dr @entity101 , chief executive and general secretary of the @entity103 said : ‘ this is further evidence of the crisis in nurse numbers facing the @entity2			0
‘ it is certainly positive that @entity2 organisations are now acknowledging the need for more nurses , but urgent action must be taken to address the current shortfalls in the nursing workforce			1
‘ one part of the solution should be to encourage registered nurses who no longer work in the @entity2 to return to practice			2
bringing their skills and experience back to the health service can be a relatively quick and cost - effective means of plugging the gaps in staffing			0
‘ such nurses are an invaluable resource for the @entity2 , but attracting them back into work will require the provision of dedicated support from employers			2
‘ there needs to be sufficient funding for return to practice programmes and suitable supervision and mentoring processes in place			0
’ nurses who have not worked for a certain amount of time have to complete a return to practice course - usually run at universities - to ensure their skills are up to date .			0
