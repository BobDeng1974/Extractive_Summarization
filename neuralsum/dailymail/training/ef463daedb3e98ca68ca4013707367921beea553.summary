it ’s a chocoholic ’s worst nightmare : a disease ravages cocoa crops , causing a worldwide chocolate shortage and the price of sweets to soar			1

‘ @entity36 plants are generally quite difficult plants to grow , ’ said @entity26 , a technician at the newly - revamped centre , which is funded half by the @entity31 chocolate industry and half by the @entity34 government			1
‘ they do n't like too much sunlight , they do n't like too much shade			2
it 's quite difficult to get the climate correct			2

here , horticultural technician @entity26 checks the leaves of young cocoa plants for pests a steamy greenhouse near @entity8 ( pictured ) is helping to ensure that cocoa crops around the world remain free of diseases to cope with our growing appetite for sweet treats and keep it affordable at a time when changing tastes in emerging economies like @entity66 and @entity67 are fuelling global demand for chocolate ( stock image ) , the centre acts as a vital resource for producer countries when pests or droughts strike crops chocolate drinks were made as early in @entity78			1
the @entity80 and @entity81 people of @entity82 first roasted and ground cocoa beans to make ' chocolate '			1
the @entity85 believed that cacao seeds were the gift of @entity88 , the @entity89 of wisdom , and the seeds had so much value they were used as a form of currency			0
the latin name for the cocoa tree is @entity36 which means ‘ @entity97 ’			2
originally prepared as a drink , chocolate was served as a bitter , frothy liquid and was often mixed with spices , wine or corn			2
it was believed to give the drinker strength and boost their libido			0
@entity108 was first added to cocoa in the 16th century when chocolate became popular the form we now recognise			2
it was originally only eaten by the rich			0
chocolate houses sprang up in @entity8 in the seventeenth century and were frequented by the upper classes - by 1700 there were 2,000 in the capital			1
by the 20th century , the sweet was popular with all classes and chocolate was considered a staple and featured in war ration packs			2
the @entity31 has the seventh highest consumption of chocolate in the world			0
the average @entity126 eats 17.49lbs ( 8kg ) of chocolate per year , according to @entity128 , but @entity129 takes the top spot			0
a total of 40 per cent of chocolate is consumed in @entity133			0
its aim is to reduce the amount of diseases affecting cocoa plants by quarantining them before sharing them with different countries to produce new , more resistant varieties			1
diseases such as @entity144 and @entity145 can decimate valuable crops			0
@entity147 , manager of the @entity11 , told @entity148 that there are various fungal diseases of cocoa such as @entity152 , which is found worldwide , witches broom disease in @entity153 and frosty pod rot , which is found in @entity155 and parts of @entity153			1
' these all spread by fungal spores			0
another disease that it important in @entity159 is @entity160 shoot virus			2
this is spread by insect vectors			0
' most of the efforts to increase cocoa supply are geared towards improving yields on existing farms rather than increasing the area cultivated			2
breeding of improved varieties that have better resistance to pests and diseases and higher yield potential is one route to achieve this and at the same time improve farmer livelihoods			0
the plants in the greenhouse were grown from cuttings or seeds collected from disease - free crops in the wild , on expeditions to the tropics			1
at a time when changing tastes in emerging economies like @entity66 and @entity67 are fuelling global demand for chocolate , the centre acts as a vital resource for producer countries when pests or droughts strike crops			1
‘ that 's where we come into play , ’ said dr @entity147 , which was set up 30 years ago			0
‘ we are the main hub for international movements of cocoa plants			1
’ new plants are needed because almost three quarters of the world ’s cocoa is grown in @entity159 , despite originating from @entity153 , according to the @entity210			1
such a heavy concentration of production in one region - the @entity214 and @entity215 alone represent 60 percent - makes it vulnerable to shocks			2
for example , the price of cocoa jumped to almost $ 3,400 ( £ 2,202 ) a tonne in september , amid fears that the @entity224 crisis in @entity159 could affect cocoa supplies			2
both @entity214 and @entity215 have so far been spared by the outbreak , but @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 , which collectively produce 0.7 per cent of the world ’s cocoa , saw their yields plummet when the disease struck			2
@entity36 prices later rebounded , and even rose 15 per cent overall , last year			0
there is also the potential threat to the industry from plant diseases , which in @entity159 can mean up to one third of the annual harvest is lost			0

here , a technician hand pollinates buds from flowers on a cocoa plant , to ensure the crop thrives dr @entity147 explained : ‘ in each cocoa - growing country , they face particular challenges to do with pest and diseases , low yield potential of planted materials , extreme weather events			1
‘ the basic objective of the project is to allow safe movement of cocoa plants from one part of the world to another			1
’ because @entity31 has no endemic pests or diseases affecting cocoa , the centre can grow resistant varieties before dispatching them around the world			1
the current quarantine procedure involves experts looking for signs of disease over a two year period , but research is under way to speed up the process			0

more mature cocoa plants are shown ‘ when we do an export , we send the small branches off a tree … we then remove all the leaves and we just send a stick , ’ dr @entity147 said			1
he explained that producer countries can then ‘ establish a plant that is genetically identical to the plant that they received the cutting from ’			0
the centre also researches the effects of climate change on cocoa crops and is looking at developing new varieties that would be more resistant to droughts or increased carbon dioxide levels , in a bid to meet the demand for chocolate			1

now horticulturists from the @entity340 at @entity370 are finding alternative species and educating coffee giants			0
professor @entity373 , head of science at @entity370 , said : ‘ we ’re finding alternative species and talking to @entity376 and @entity377 ’s and other big coffee importers and producers so that information flows through to big business			0
‘ by 2050 - 2080 there could be a 100 per cent reduction in @entity345 in the wild because of the dry , so we will need to move to the other 124 species of coffee			0
’ this is because those growing in coffee plantations are from limited genetic stock and are unlikely to have the flexibility required to cope with repeated dry spells and other threats , such as pests and diseases , which could potentially create a shortage of good coffee ( a stock image is shown ) she said @entity370 coffee research head @entity399 was looking in countries such as @entity402 for more resistant strains of coffee that can be grown with better climatic tolerance than @entity345 , but lots of the varieties found there taste ‘ horrible ’			1
while there are almost 125 species of coffee , @entity345 is the most popular by far and is considered the most important global commodity , after oil			0
@entity370 is setting up a new company in may called @entity414 to sell commercially useful information			0
‘ we are focusing @entity370 ’s science in those areas where we can truly make a unique impact on people ’s lives , thanks to our unrivalled collection of specimens and the world - leading expertise of our evolutionary botanists , mycologists , taxonomists and systematists , professor @entity416 said			0
@entity370 has cut 100 jobs in the last eight months - half from the science department - after a cut in government funding .			0

the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) is based near @entity8
steamy greenhouse *mimics* a tropical climate so cocoa crops thrive
cocoa plants are grown that can be shared with cocoa - producing countries
this practice produces new , more disease resistant varieties
work is important in creating a steady supply of cocoa , which makes sure the price of chocolate does n't soar and crops meet demand
