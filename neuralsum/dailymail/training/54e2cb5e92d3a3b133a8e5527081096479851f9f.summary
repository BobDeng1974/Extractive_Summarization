tv watchdog @entity0 has warned broadcasters about airing violence before 9pm after @entity5 soap @entity3 was found to have breached programme rules			1
the regulator said a scene in the soap aired in march in which a lead character was pushed under a train was ' violent and shocking ' and unsuitable for pre- 9pm viewing			1
@entity5 argued it had taken measures to comply with the watershed rules			1
the regulator is now commissioning research into viewers ' attitudes towards on - screen violence and assessing whether the amount of violence on @entity24 tv in everything from documentaries to dramas has increased over the decades			1
the announcement came as @entity0 issued a statement to ' remind television broadcasters of the need to ensure that all material broadcast pre-watershed which features violent scenes is appropriately limited '			1
' broadcasters should consider whether individual acts of violence within a programme are suitable , as well as where the overall tone is malevolent , menacing and threatening , that this also remains suitably limited , ' it said			0
@entity3 breached broadcasting rules in an episode , screened at 6.30pm in march , in which a main character was killed by a speeding train			1
the scene marked the culmination of a long - running revenge storyline involving a former undercover policeman , @entity33 , and ex-drug dealer @entity34			0
it ended with @entity33 screaming as he fell backwards on to the railway track and into the path of a train before the camera cut away to show the train passing at high speed			0
there were no images of @entity33 being hit by the train but the fight in the build - up included several blows to the face and stomach , @entity34 ’s head being pushed through railings , @entity33 with bloody lips and blood running from his nose , while viewers heard the groans as they inflicted blows			0
@entity5 said that the storyline had run for around a year and that viewers were notified that a dramatic episode would be broadcast			2
defence : @entity5 said that the storyline had run for around a year and that viewers were notified that a dramatic episode would be broadcast dramatic : the scene ended with @entity33 screaming as he fell backwards on to the railway track and into the path of a train before the camera cut away to show the train passing at high speed it said that the fight scene only lasted around a minute , was at the end of the episode and carefully edited			1
the watershed was first introduced in the @entity110 of 1964 to ensure programmes before 9pm were suitable for family viewing			2
swearing and sex and violence in shows such as @entity116 , one night with @entity117 and @entity118 have been criticised in recent years for their pre- 9pm content			1
@entity121 was also condemned after 65 people complained to @entity0 about bondage scenes in a @entity125 video ( below )			1
last year , the @entity127 - run service @entity128 , which is on @entity129 , was found to have breached rules when variants of the f - word were aired five times in a programme called @entity135 , which was shown at 6pm			0
@entity136 was also rapped last year after it showed @entity138 film ' hanging up ' in an 8pm slot which included repeated use of the f - word			0
@entity142 entertainment was found to have breached the broadcasting code by broadcasting nude women in editions of @entity147 ( below ) throughout the day when children could be watching			0
the regulator has also previously ruled that @entity151 's music videos contained ' highly sexualised images ' and ' offensive language '			2
and an episode of @entity155 involving a fight between the @entity158 brothers , and a gang attack on @entity160 , were also previously raised as scenes for concern			0
@entity0 said that it accepted that violence was ' a part of life and integral to many dramas , including those broadcast pre-watershed			2
' but it said that the pre-programme information was too vague and would ' not have prepared the significant number of younger viewers in the audience , or their parents , adequately for the violent , intense and shocking scenes which followed			1
' it said : ' this scene was both violent and shocking and had the potential to distress younger viewers as well as raise concerns about the level of violence amongst parents watching with their children regardless of the editorial context presented or the signposting provided			1
for all these reasons @entity0 considered that it was unsuitable for children			2
' the watchdog added : ‘ it was clearly intended to leave viewers with the impression that both characters experienced violent punches to the head and body , as was evident from the blood on their faces as a result of these blows and the groans and moans from the characters			0
' it said that research , carried out in 2010 , showed that parents ’ biggest concerns about pre-watershed content was violence , sexually explicit content and offensive language			0
soaps were the programmes which caused most concern			0
@entity5 argued that @entity3 , which regularly deals with story lines about sexual abuse , domestic violence and drugs , was aimed at a teenage audience			1
but @entity0 said figures showed that 15 per cent of the audience of the train death episode were children aged four to 15 and 10 per cent were aged four to nine			2
the watchdog ' concluded that cumulatively the violent content in this sequence exceeded viewers ’ expectations for a drama transmitted long before the watershed when young children were available to view and in this case were watching in large numbers '			2
@entity0 said that there was no reliable research into the attitudes of @entity237 viewers on the issue of violence before and just after the watershed			1
it intends to publish its new research next year			0
@entity241 , its director of content standards , said : ' broadcasters have a duty to protect children from violent material			0
the rules in this area are very clear , making it unacceptable for any broadcaster to include scenes of violence that are unsuitable for children before the watershed			1
' the protection of under - 18s from potentially harmful content is a key area of concern for @entity0			0
as such we have commissioned new research into viewers ’ attitudes to violence on television			0
' this will further inform us about the level of concern about violence on television - and will contribute to our ongoing work on the enforcement of the 9pm watershed			0
' a @entity5 spokesman said ‘ correct editorial processes were followed ’ and it was ‘ committed to ensuring all @entity3 storylines are appropriate for a pre-watershed audience ’ .			1

@entity0 said the @entity3 scene was too ' violent and shocking ' for pre- 9pm
but @entity5 argued that it had followed watershed rules for the scene
