their decisions are likely to cause huge offence to many fans of @entity36 miss @entity7 ’s family said the 22 - year - old footballer had chosen not to sing the anthem ‘ because she is @entity3 ’			1
the rarely sung fifth verse of the anthem , written in the 1740s , includes the controversial words : ‘ rebellious @entity3 to crush			0
’ the @entity44 was said to be furious about her decision			0
a spokesman for the association – which has previously stated that all athletes should learn the @entity6 – gave a terse statement saying : ' it 's an individual choice ( as to whether or not to sing ) , but the most important thing is to show respect			2
' other @entity24 athletes openly criticised her stance			0
former javelin thrower and @entity12 silver medallist @entity56 said : ‘ i think it ’s a poor show if you are competing under a @entity24 flag and you do n’t feel proud to be @entity24			2
@entity61 silences his critics netting from a @entity20 cross to put @entity17 ahead all smiles : @entity61 's @entity6 snub is quickly forgotten as he opens the scoring for @entity5 patriotic : @entity5 manager @entity70 proudly belted out the national anthem before the game ‘ it ’s fine for you to believe in @entity3 independence and to have your own beliefs – there has always been a bit of a rivalry – but if you are competing under a @entity24 flag you need to feel @entity24			1
’ but miss @entity7 ’s grandfather @entity81 , 82 , who is an @entity82 voter and wants an independent @entity3 , said he ‘ supported her 100 per cent ’ in her decision			2
‘ it ’s the national anthem of @entity86 , and she is @entity3 , ’ he said			0
‘ it is her decision and i support it 100 per cent			0
i would have done the same			0
in my personal view i would like to see a @entity3 team at the @entity12			1
’ he admitted his granddaughter ’s decision would ‘ offend some people ’ , but added : ‘ i do n’t think that ’s a bad thing			0
’ a young @entity5 fan gets into the @entity12 spirit with her face painted up in patriotic red , white and blue young fans cheer on the @entity24 men at a packed @entity102 come on , boys : young shirtless fans enjoy the action in a @entity110 interview @entity106 , who is from @entity107 , @entity108 , said her decision not to sing the anthem was ‘ just a personal choice ’			1
after the match that night , she told reporters : ‘ i ’m delighted to be representing @entity3 in the @entity17 team			1
’ her father @entity115 , 55 , an @entity116 worker , said he was not aware of his daughter ’s decision not to sing the @entity6			0
he said : ‘ i would n’t say she is a nationalist			0
she is very patriotic for @entity3			0
she is cheering for @entity5 and we ’re very pleased and we ’re very proud of her			0
’ the second @entity3 player who could be seen not singing the anthem , @entity125 , was born in @entity126 to @entity128 parents but mostly raised in @entity3			2
@entity129 : @entity102 was nearly full as the fans flocked to @entity131 for @entity5 's opening group game line up : @entity5 pose for the traditional pre-match photo the @entity136 team pose for picture ahead of kick off @entity138 : @entity136 's @entity139 celebrates scoring the late equaliser that denied @entity5 a winning start she qualified to play for the @entity143 , the gold medal favourites , but rejected their overtures eight years ago in favour of the country where she was brought up			1
the 31 - year - old defender , who plays for @entity152 side @entity151 , has said : ‘ i came to @entity153 when i was three - and - a - half and @entity3 is the only country i would feel comfortable playing for ... @entity3 ’s all i ’ve known from an early age			0
’ it was not known last night if @entity20 and @entity61 had made an active decision not to sing the anthem at the start of the match against @entity136			2
@entity20 , who is the @entity5 men ’s football captain , has previously said he is ‘ @entity4 and proud of it ’ but sees it as ‘ nothing but positive ’ that he can play for @entity5 as well			1
but his and @entity61 ’s failure to sing drew criticism on football forums and @entity167			0
one forum member wrote : ‘ @entity20 and @entity25 not singing the national anthem of @entity17 was bang out of order ! they should be honoured to be there ! ’ another wrote : ‘ i think it ’s down to the fact that they feel under pressure not to sing the national anthem , probably get slated by the taffies			1
’ however , the two @entity180 did their best to deflect any criticism of their commitment to the cause by combining for the opening goal , with @entity61 netting off a @entity20 cross			0
but there was heartbreak for @entity5 as @entity136 drew level with less than ten minutes to go			0
it was @entity17 's first @entity12 men 's football match since 1960 , but it 's 100 years since they last lifted gold in this tournament			1
and in contrast to the disappointing crowd that watched the women 's opening game , 72,176 turned up to watch the men in action			1
@entity20 , 38 , had said before the game : ' to be involved in a tournament at such a late stage of my career is one i 'm looking forward to			0
show of support : a young fan painted her face with the @entity210 , while another fan shows her support for one man whose omission threatened to overshadow the team 's preparations @entity12 spirit : a @entity136 fan is all smiles before kick - off ' all the lads have embraced it , we were fortunate to go to the village last week , you want to enjoy the @entity12 experience but the bottom line is you want to win football matches			1
' but it follows another embarrassing day for the @entity12 organisers after @entity4 player @entity231 was described as @entity232 in the official programme			2
the midfielder , who speaks fluent @entity4 and plays for @entity235 , is one of five @entity180 in the @entity5 squad but the only one mistaken ; t identified as @entity232			2
a @entity238 spokeswoman said : ' there was an error in our programme and we inadvertently listed @entity231 as @entity232			0
' we apologise for this mistake and new programmes are now being printed with the correction in time for @entity5 's next match			2
' empty stands : @entity17 's @entity248 celebrates after scoring at the @entity249 - which was barely a quarter full unlike their male counterparts , the @entity5 women were able to get off to a winning start with a 1 - 0 victory over @entity18 do n't forget to pick up your copy of today 's @entity256 for your guide to the @entity12 .			1
