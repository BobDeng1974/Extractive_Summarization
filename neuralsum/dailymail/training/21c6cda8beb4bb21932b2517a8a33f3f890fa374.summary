by @entity1 reporter published : 20:35 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 16 october 2013 the second victim in the outrageous @entity4 high school rape case has come forward , telling how she was sexually assaulted at the same time that her friend @entity5 was being attacked in a nearby room by an older high school football player			1
the girl , who has only identified herself as @entity9 , said that she was with her friend when they went over to meet up with a group of boys but they fought back when the boys started to attack them			1
@entity9 , who was with @entity5 on the night of the january 2012 attack , spoke about the attack for the first time on @entity20 tonight with her mother , @entity5 , and @entity5 's mother all by her side			1
' ( @entity5 ) had texted @entity24 because @entity24 wanted to see her ... so we snuck out and we got there and i was immediately separated from her and taken into another room and sexually assaulted after i said no and pushed him away , ' she told @entity20 's @entity29			1
victim : @entity5 ( right ) was found by her mother @entity31 ( left ) after she was allegedly raped by a boy from her high school and he has not faced any charges breaking her silence : @entity9 ( left ) is @entity5 's friend and was with her when she was attacked			1
another boy also sexually assaulted @entity5 and she remembers the horrible incident taking action : the girls and their mothers deny that they refused to cooperate , as the sheriff has said			1
that was the reason why he said that the boys involved were never charged @entity9 did not name her 15 - year - old attacker but said that unlike @entity5 , she remembers all of the details of the attack			1
' after he was done and we went out to the living room we waited for @entity24 to come out with @entity5 and he opened the door and i saw @entity5 and she was incoherent - could n't talk , could n't walk , could n't do anything			1
' @entity9 went on to talk to @entity53 who posted an edited transcript of their interview on their website			0
' they drug [ sic ] her out of his bedroom window , drug [ sic ] her to the car , and then they were going to drop us off , but they were freaking out , trying to think of how they were going to drop us off without any of her brothers waking up , ' she told @entity53			0
opening up : @entity9 , seen here with her mother , said that the ordeal was ' very scary ' ' they took her and carried her to the back corner of her house and left her there			0
and they told me to go inside , that all she needed to do was to sober up , and that she would be okay , and they were gon na be there and watch her			0
' it was very scary			0
i was really confused and did nâ€™t understand what was fully going on			0
i was in shock and really worried about my friend			2
there was just a lot of things going through my mind			0
' @entity5 became suicidal after she was allegedly raped at age 14 , then tormented by cyber bullies , her mother says @entity5 was 14 and @entity9 was 13 at the time of the attack and the boys have never been charged because the local sheriff in @entity97 , @entity4 claims @entity5 would not testify			1
@entity5 denies his claims , saying that she was never asked to testify or else she would in hopes of getting her attacker - @entity24 - behind bars			1
the girls stories have been corroborated by the evidence - including an @entity105 video of the attack that one of @entity24 's friends took that night			1
now @entity5 's mother @entity31 is continuing to put pressure on the sheriff 's department , saying justice was denied when @entity114 's prosecutor dropped felony charges against the two 17 - year - old boys involved in @entity5 's alleged rape			1
' how do you think we did n't want to cooperate ? ' @entity118 asked			0
' we went to get a rape kit done			0
i wrote a statement , and my daughter gave a statement to the police			0
' @entity118 said that no depositions were conducted before the felony charges were dropped			2
she said she was asked but refused to invoke the @entity130 before a planned may 31 , 2012 , deposition			0
@entity114 prosecutor @entity132 issued a statement saying there was n't enough evidence to pursue the charges because the accusers had stopped cooperating and asserted their fifth amendment rights against self - incrimination , but now the state 's lt. governor is getting involved			1
friends : @entity9 , seen at left with @entity5 at right , said that she remembers the night of the attack because the boys made @entity5 drink much more than she had to better times : @entity5 has said that she started self harming and tried killing herself following the attack on tuesday night , @entity150 put out a statement calling for another investigation into the case			1
' the appalling facts in the public record shock the conscience and cry out that responsible authorities must take another look			0
i call on attorney general @entity160 and @entity161 to join me in asking that the @entity162 convene a grand jury to review all the evidence , hear all witnesses , and issue a decision as to whether charges should ensue , ' @entity150 wrote			1
in an interview , sheriff @entity168 backed up @entity132 's statement			2
the case has drawn new attention since the @entity173 published the results sunday of a seven - month investigation into the allegations			2
@entity178 's story described a town where many appeared to be closing ranks around the accused and suggesting the girls were somehow responsible for the incident			1
arson : the charred remains still stand months later of the fire - damaged home of @entity187 and her children at 27932 @entity189 in @entity97 , @entity4 this photo taken on october 9 , 2013 the charred remains still stand months later of the fire - damaged home of @entity187 and her children at 27932 @entity189 in @entity97 , @entity4 in april , after the family had moved , the family 's home in @entity97 was damaged in a fire , though a cause has not been determined			2
@entity196 , an attorney who represented the teen accused of assaulting @entity5 , said in a written statement that while many may find his former client 's behavior ' reprehensible , ' the legal issue is whether a crime occurred			1
he said the investigation raised questions about whether the 14 - year - old was ' incapacitated during the encounter			2
' he also said the charges were dropped after the accusers ' stories changed during @entity211 says her 14 - year - old daughter was given alcohol in january 2012 and raped by a 17 - year - old acquaintance			2
accusations : @entity5 , pictured left with her brother , told police that she became so drunk she could n't remember anything at a party thrown by several older high school boys @entity9 , @entity5 's 13 - year - old friend says she was forced to have sex with a 15 - year - old at the same house , while another 17 - year - old allegedly recorded the incident on a cellphone			1
the daughter acknowledged she and the friend left her house to meet the boys but said they gave her alcohol and she does n't remember much of what happened next			2
the boys said the sex was consensual			0
the two 17 - year - old boys were charged as adults , but @entity132 dropped felony counts against them several months later			2
a misdemeanor count against the teen accused of assaulting @entity5 was dropped subsequently			1
the prosecutor cited a lack of evidence and the @entity246 ' refusal to cooperate			2
the 15 - year - old was charged in juvenile court			0
the entrance of @entity250 @entity5 was subjected to constant bullying from classmates - and even parents - in @entity97 , @entity4 , after she reported she had been raped in january 2012 sheriff @entity168 said he never understood the @entity256 ' reasoning and that authorities were n't considering charges against the 14 - year - old girl			1
' they stonewalled the case all by themselves , ' he said			0
now that the family is saying they will cooperate , he was n't sure whether that would make a difference			0
' they would n't cooperate and then they said they would cooperate			0
and then they would n't cooperate			0
and then they went back and forth , ' @entity168 said			0
' i 'm guessing , and this is just speculation , but i 'm guessing that the prosecutor would be a little gun shy to believe that they would be willing to cooperate at this time			0
