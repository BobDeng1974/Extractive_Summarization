by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 13:44 est , 14 march 2014 expectant mothers in @entity3 can choose to block their baby 's father from the delivery room after a landmark court ruling on privacy rights			1
details of the ruling were released this week , but the case was heard last year when @entity12 sued his ex-fiancée @entity13 to make her inform him when she went into labor			1
arguments in the case were heard up to the very last moment , with @entity13 giving statements during a telephone conference as she had the baby			1
the couple had separated before their planned wedding last year , but @entity12 was determined to be a part of his baby 's life			1
when he ruled on the case in november last year superior court judge @entity42 said all patients , especially pregnant women , had privacy rights that allow them to decide who can be at their bedside			1
the judge referred to two landmark @entity50 abortion rulings - @entity52 from 1973 and @entity53 in 1992 - to determine his case , stating that they show a woman has a stronger right over her body and unborn child than the baby 's father			2
' any interest a father has before the child ’s birth is subordinate to the mother ’s interests			1
even when there is no doubt that a father has shown deep and proper concern and interest in the growth and development of the fetus , ' the judge wrote			0
he added that by being at the birth , the father would have access to medical information about the mother that she may not want to share			2
hearing : superior court judge @entity42 , pictured in 2011 , made the ruling in november last year the ruling has been criticized by fathers ' rights groups , who say it demotes the role of a man as being nothing more than a pay check			1
@entity89 , of @entity90 , told @entity91 : ' it ’s a sad day for fathers , and for father 's and men ’s rights			1
' the way we look at it is a child is born , a child had two parents and they should be two equal parents			0
' @entity101 's attorney , @entity100 , told @entity102 : ' they were estranged from one another at the time delivery was approaching , for quite some time			0
they were n’t communicating more than a little text here or there			0
' @entity108 said the case came to its conclusion as @entity101 was in the delivery room , where she later gave birth to a baby girl			2
she added that the mother had planned to provide him access to the baby , but as a hospital visitor			0
the father 's attorney , @entity119 , said her client never asked to be in the delivery room but had wanted to see his baby as soon as possible			0
' he wanted to be a very involved father from the instant his child was born			0
it was important that he have the right to bond just as the mother would , ' she said			0
@entity27 does not plan to appeal the ruling and was able to see his daughter shortly after she was born .			2

@entity12 sued his *ex-girlfriend* last year to make her tell him when she went into labor
final hearing took place via phone as @entity13 was giving birth
fathers ' rights groups have *condemned* the ruling
