a royal source said : ‘ he was incredibly , incredibly angry			2
it was very much a case of guns being pointed at him and “ halt who goes there ”			2
’ yesterday police issued a humiliating apology to the @entity3 over the extraordinary error			1
according to the @entity41 , a source said that the @entity3 was red faced as he shouted at officers like a school teacher			1
they said : ' it got pretty heated because he just kept repeating himself " do n't you know who i am ? "			2
' he felt the officers had sneaked up on him and believed they had behaved disrespectfully towards him			2
' they added that when the penny dropped they apologised to prince @entity9			0
but this was not enough			0
the source added : ' he gave them a proper dressing down , shouting at them like a schoolteacher before he walked back to the main house - completely livid			0
' it was the second police fiasco within three days at what should be one of the most secure estates in @entity64			1
just 48 hours earlier officers discovered a mentally ill man attempting to smash down a door with a fire extinguisher after he scaled a 12ft wall and broke in			1
yesterday @entity70 revealed senior officers had personally apologised to prince @entity9 in a bid to draw a line under the latest matter			0
’ @entity70 declined to comment on reports that the officers shouted at the 53 - year - old royal , telling him to ‘ put your hands up ’ and ‘ get on the ground ’			0
a source said it would not be ‘ uncommon ’ for police to shout when challenging someone , but added that they did not know if he was ordered to lie down			1
in return , prince @entity9 issued a conciliatory statement , saying : ‘ the police have a difficult job to do balancing security for the royal family and deterring intruders , and sometimes they get it wrong			1
’ but hinting at his anger over the confrontation , he added : ‘ i am grateful for their apology and look forward to a safe walk in the garden in the future			2
’ royal sources said @entity9 had been ‘ infuriated ’ by the fiasco			0
they continued to insist that weapons had been drawn by police , who were in a state of high tension following the previous security breach			1

break in : @entity144 was arrested inside the palace the prince had just returned from a two - week holiday in @entity148 with his former wife @entity149 , the @entity150 , and their daughters @entity153 , 25 , and @entity154 , 23			1
the pair of uniformed marksmen challenged him after discovering him near a perimeter wall in a relatively isolated area of the palace garden			2
royal staff are said to be incredulous that those involved failed to recognise the prince , although officially police chiefs are saying they did nothing wrong			2
one source said : ‘ once it was clear who @entity9 was , he certainly made his thoughts plain about what had happened			0
' it has been the subject of a lot of conversation , especially as @entity9 is not exactly known for suffering fools gladly			0
’ his former protection officer @entity174 describes him as rude , bossy and terse			0
at the time of the incident , the @entity143 ’s royal protection unit was on high alert after @entity144 , 37 , was caught inside the ornate @entity179 on monday night			1

no royals were present when the break - in took place but experts are incredulous that @entity144 got so far before being stopped			1
the two incidents highlight the tension between police and the royal family over security			2
the queen – who is currently staying at @entity207 with prince @entity123 – has made it clear she wants the palace to be accessible to the public as possible			0
former @entity70 commissioner lord @entity211 played down the prince @entity9 confrontation as he said it was impossible to make any site completely secure			0
‘ they will have to look at this , ’ he added			0
‘ the story of the burglar is a much more difficult story than the @entity9 story			0
’ last night , former royal protection chief @entity220 said of the prince @entity9 incident : ‘ [ the officers ] were alert and that was good , but saying that , they should know who @entity224 is			0
‘ it is a very big garden and we do n’t know where he was and who he told , but you would expect officers to be aware if he had gone out			1
' why was n’t anybody aware that he was having a walk about ? ‘ they are right to challenge anybody they do n’t know , quite obviously if they do n’t and something happens … they are criticised			0
’ a @entity143 spokesman declined to comment on whether the officers would face any disciplinary action or ‘ words of advice ’			1
he said : ‘ uniformed officers approached a man in the gardens of @entity8 to verify his identity			1
