these are some of the world 's largest trees , rising majestically out of the snowy slopes along the @entity5 mountain range			1
photographer @entity6 spent two weeks capturing images of the ' president ' - the world 's second - biggest tree which is at least 3,200 years old in @entity11 , deep in the southern region			2
sequoias only grow on the western slope of the @entity5 , a mountain range which runs 400 miles through @entity5 and @entity16			1
giant sequoias can reach 247 - feet - the height of a 20 - storey building			2
the following is an excerpt from the december issue of @entity41 : ' it ’s not quite the largest tree on @entity44			2
it ’s the second largest			2
stunning : the december issue of @entity41 ' recent research by scientist @entity47 of @entity48 and his colleagues has confirmed that the president ranks number two among all big trees that have ever been measured — and @entity47 ’s team has measured quite a few			1
it does n’t stand so tall as the tallest of coast redwoods or of @entity56 in @entity57 , but height is n’t everything ; it ’s far more massive than any coast redwood or eucalypt			2
' its dead spire , blasted by lightning , rises to 247 feet			2
its four great limbs , each as big as a sizable tree , elbow outward from the trunk around halfway up , billowing into a thick crown like a mushroom cloud flattening against the sky			2
' although its trunk is n’t quite so bulky as that of the largest giant , the @entity75 , its crown is fuller than the @entity75 ’s			0
the president holds nearly two billion leaves			0
' trees grow tall and wide - crowned as a measure of competition with other trees , racing upward , reaching outward for sunlight and water			1
and a tree does n’t stop getting larger — as a terrestrial mammal does , or a bird , their size constrained by gravity — once it ’s sexually mature			0
a tree too is constrained by gravity , but not in the same way as a condor or a giraffe			0
' it does n’t need to locomote , and it fortifies its structure by continually adding more wood			0
given the constant imperative of seeking resources from the sky and the soil , and with sufficient time , a tree can become huge and then keep growing			0
giant sequoias are gigantic because they are very , very old			0
' see below for additional images iconic : the president is one of the major tourist draws at the @entity108 which covers much of the @entity5 immense : the tallest sequoias are so large that it is impossible to look at them in one go intrepid : a researcher climbs a sequoia as part of an effort to measure and map the giant trees survivors : many of the most impressive trees were destroyed soon after they were discovered by settlers in the 19th century gorgeous : the majestic plants are considered one of the greatest natural wonders in the @entity126 the ' rusty red ' tree has a footprint as large as a room in an average home , and is so huge that it is almost impossible to look at			1
their giant size allows them to survive disasters which would wipe out many of their woodland competitors - they are unaffected by storms , resistant to forest fire and can live even after being struck by lightning			0
and the trees never stop growing even when they are hundreds of feet tall - in fact , their rate of growth has been found to increase the older they are			1
the trunk is constantly widening , while the upper limbs grow stronger even as the trees age			1
@entity47 and his helpers proved this unexpected finding by climbing up the biggest trees and measuring them more thoroughly than had ever been done before			1
discovery : the trees were a source of huge fascination when they were found by settlers destruction : the early settlers were not afraid to cut down the giant trees for timber innovation : a settler in 1890 shows off the path he has cut through the giant sequoia @entity167 the giant sequoia - @entity169 - tends to live for many centuries , enabling it to grow larger than any other species of plant			1
the trees are naturally found only in a small area of the @entity5 in @entity16 , nearly all of which is covered by the @entity108			1
while they have been successfully grown in other areas of @entity179 and around the world , nowhere have they been standing long enough to challenge the size records set by the @entity5 giants			1
they can live for up to 3,500 years , reaching heights comparable to skyscrapers			0
the tallest trees currently standing include the president , the @entity75 and the @entity189 , all above 240ft - but they are far from the tallest known in history			1
soon after the sequoia was discovered by @entity126 settlers in the early 19th century , many of the most impressive specimens were cut down and exhibited to gawking crowds			0
one of the biggest of them all was known as the @entity197 , which stood in the area from 668 bc and was discovered by @entity200 in 1852			0
he stripped the bark of the tree , leading to its swift demise , while a forest fire in 1908 destroyed what was left			0
champion : the @entity75 is the tallest tree in the world still standing , at a staggering 275ft			0

mammoth trees only grow on western slopes of mountain range running through @entity16 and @entity5
