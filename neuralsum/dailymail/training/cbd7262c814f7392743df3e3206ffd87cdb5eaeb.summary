by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:43 am on 25th december 2011 children hoping to wake up to a magical blanket of snow today will be sorely disappointed			1
not only can we kiss goodbye to dreams of a @entity8 this year , it ’s not even going to feel that cold			2
forecasters say that temperatures over the coming days may be some of the warmest for the time of year in more than a decade – milder than @entity12 and @entity13			2
temperatures of around @entity15 to @entity16 are expected across the country , with some parts of the @entity19 reaching up to @entity20			1
balmy : a family enjoy a pre-christmas walk in @entity24 , @entity25 , yesterday , as temperatures continue to stay unseasonably mild winter warmer : temperatures this month could approach the warmest for this time of year in a decade , according to forecasters it leaves temperatures close to the warmest @entity31 on record , registered when thermometers hit @entity34 in 1896 and 1920			2
even @entity36 mountain peaks will have escaped snowfall			2
conditions for today and @entity39 are likely to be cloudy , blustery and ‘ unseasonably mild ’			2
in many parts of the country , temperatures will be several degrees warmer than average – without a snowflake in sight			0
it ’s certainly very different from this time last year , when the country was in the grip of a big freeze and some areas recorded their coldest ever temperature			0
for example at @entity56 , in the @entity55 , the mercury plummeted to -18c ( -0.4f ) but this year , most of us will enjoy temperatures of between 11 and 13c ( 52 to 55f )			0
the average is around 7 to 10c ( 45 to 50f ) in the @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 temperatures could reach 14c ( 57f ) , which would make them the highest since 1997			1
while there may be drizzle in the @entity63 and @entity64 , it will begin to clear and most of the country will remain dry until tuesday			0
@entity73 , forecaster for the @entity74 said : ‘ it ’s a stark contrast to last year			0
temperatures will be mild for all parts of the @entity19			1
a runner takes advantage of the warmer temperatures in @entity24 , @entity25 , which could be the highest at @entity8 since 1997 ' we are expecting it cloudy and dry , blustery in the @entity65 and breezy in the ‘ this is due to a milder air mass. ' we ’re likely to keep this general pattern through to the @entity86 and then there are likely to be some colder snaps			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity91 there were record minimum temperatures in @entity93 and @entity36			1
‘ after a short cooler interlude next midweek , the set - up which has brought the current milder conditions will return , with south - westerly winds			0
’ it means @entity19 may have a warmer @entity8 than @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity99 , all of which are likely to experience temperatures of 11c ( 52f )			1
however , the temperatures will fall short of the @entity91 record of 15.6c ( 60f ) , set in 1896			1
other forecasters predicted that , bizarrely , those in the @entity65 could experience some of the warmest weather			0
@entity107 , forecaster from the website @entity109 , said : ‘ because of fairly strong south - westerly winds , the @entity65 could see some of the warmest temperatures , with 14c ( 57f ) possible			0
‘ it should make for ideal conditions for walking off the @entity8 turkey – although the west and north of @entity36 will buck the trend with some heavy rain			0

@entity19 could see mildest @entity91 since 1997
