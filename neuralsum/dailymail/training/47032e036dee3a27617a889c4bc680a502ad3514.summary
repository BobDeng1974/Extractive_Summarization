by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 10 may 2013 @entity1 was accused of ‘ treachery ’ by senior conservatives last night after pulling the rug from under the government ’s flagship childcare reforms			1
the deputy prime minister plunged @entity9 relations to a new low after publicly attacking proposals to help cut costs for working families by relaxing rules on the number of toddlers that nurseries and childminders can supervise			2
the @entity18 said mr @entity1 had signed off the plans before they were announced earlier this year and pointed out the changes would be optional for pre-school providers , increasing choice for parents			1
it makes clear that miss @entity27 flagged up the change in ratios of carers to children as ‘ the most high - profile of my proposals ’			0
in his reply , mr @entity1 gives her clearance to press ahead			1
angry @entity18 backbenchers urged @entity41 to ignore mr @entity1 ’s last - minute objections and press ahead			1
in an article today for @entity44 , sir @entity45 , the former head of the children ’s charity @entity46 , also dismissed the ‘ noise ’ from mr @entity1 and praised the ‘ brave reform ’			1
he said many nurseries would welcome new flexibilities , which were ‘ widespread in @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , all widely recognised as having excellent childcare systems and all of which have minimum ratios larger than ours ’			2
mr @entity1 told his weekly phone - in show on the radio station @entity62 : ' i think four [ children ] is already quite a handful , just imagine if they go up to six ' ‘ we need better staff and we need to allow them more professional discretion in determining how many children for whom they can safely care , ’ he added			1
miss @entity27 , the architect of the reforms , was dragged to the @entity73 after mr @entity1 ’s office confirmed he had had second thoughts about backing them			1
miss @entity27 insisted the current system of childcare was ‘ not working for parents ’ , who faced some of the highest costs in the world			2
under the government ’s proposals , in september the minimum staff - child ratio for children aged one and under will ease from 1:3 to 1:4 and those for two - year - olds from 1:4 to 1:6 , where staff are better qualified			0
in @entity94 and @entity95 , the ratio for two - year - olds is one adult to six children , in @entity52 it is 1:8 , while in @entity53 and in @entity54 there are no national staff ratios at all , miss @entity27 said			0
‘ at present we have the tightest ratios in @entity102 for children under three and we also have the lowest staff salaries			0
nursery staff here earn £ 6.60 on average , barely above the minimum wage			0
our proposals will allow nurseries who hire high - quality staff to be able to exercise professional judgment			0
’ but mr @entity1 insisted he had reservations about changing the ratio			1
‘ when we as a government consulted on changing the number of little toddlers that each adult can look after , the response from experts , from parents from nurseries was overwhelmingly negative , ’ he said			0
‘ they felt that the risks outweighed the benefits and it would n’t necessarily reduce costs			0
’ mr @entity1 told his weekly phone - in show on the radio station @entity62 : ‘ i think four [ children ] is already quite a handful , just imagine if they go up to six			1
this is not a great ideological thing , this is just about getting it right for parents up and down the country			0
’ sir @entity45 , the former head of the children 's charity @entity46 , has dismissed the ' noise ' from mr @entity1 and praised the ' brave reform ' in the @entity73 , @entity18 @entity141 lined up to support miss @entity27 , who is tipped as a potential party leader , and urged her to go ahead with the changes			1
@entity145 mp @entity144 described giving nurseries more choice over child - to - adult ratios as ‘ a good @entity18 policy ’			2
he added : ‘ the deputy prime minister , if he wants to comment on this , if he does n’t want to run away from something he has agreed on , he should be in this @entity155 , not on a radio programme			0
i suggest we press on with this policy and ignore the @entity158			2
’ senior conservatives were scathing about the @entity158 ’ change of heart , with one accusing mr @entity1 of ‘ appalling treachery ’			1
another accused him of ‘ running scared after the usual whinges from the trade unions and lefties on @entity166 ’			0
the prime minister ’s spokesman said @entity41 ‘ very much shares ’ miss @entity27 ’s views on the need for reform			2
but professor @entity173 , who was commissioned by former @entity158 children ’s minister @entity174 to review childcare qualifications last year , said : ‘ there really is a need to slow down this policy to ensure that well - qualified people are available			0
’ @entity181 education secretary @entity180 said : ‘ @entity41 and @entity1 are creating chaos and confusion on childcare			1

@entity1 publicly attacks @entity187 's flagship childcare reforms
angry @entity18 backbenchers have urged @entity41 to ignore objections
conservatives claim @entity1 signed off plans before they were announced
