the @entity1 failed to properly investigate why money had gone missing from branches before launching court proceedings against subpostmasters , a report revealed yesterday			1
many were sacked , stripped of their savings and even jailed after cash shortfalls were recorded at some branches – despite claims that a faulty it system was to blame			1
the @entity1 asked forensic accountants @entity12 to investigate the @entity15 it system in 2012 , following complaints from dozens of subpostmasters who said they had been wrongly accused of theft , fraud and false accounting when cash shortfalls were discovered			1
the @entity1 failed to properly investigate why money had gone missing from branches before launching court proceedings against subpostmasters , a report has revealed ( file picture ) now a leaked copy of the accountants ’ independent report has suggested that the discrepancies could have been caused by computer failures , cyber criminals or human error			1
it also accused the @entity1 of failing ‘ in many cases ’ to identify ‘ the root cause of shortfalls ’ before starting civil or criminal proceedings			2
the review said some criminal cases brought by the @entity1 were ‘ motivated primarily ’ by a desire to recover the money and did not appear to be supported by sufficient evidence			1
it went on to claim that the @entity1 had failed to provide the accountancy firm with the documentation they required , and had ‘ terminated ’ their contract before they finished their research			1
the report has sparked fresh calls for a full independent inquiry into the computer system used by postmasters after the report reported concerns that ‘ in some circumstances @entity15 can be systemically flawed ’			0
former conservative mp @entity57 said some subpostmasters had been ' dragged through the mud ' former conservative mp @entity57 , who led an @entity64 ’ campaign to support the subpostmasters , said : ‘ these people have been pillars of the community who had their reputations dragged through the mud – some have been sent to prison , they ’ve been made bankrupt , they ’ve had contracts terminated , i understand at least one has committed suicide			1
and the way they have been treated is an utter disgrace			0
i think there needs to be an independent inquiry			0
’ responding to the report , the @entity1 said the review had repeated ‘ complaints made by a very small number of former postmasters , as well as a number of assertions and opinions ’ – but had not offered any new evidence to support the claims			1
they pointed out that they have received 150 complaints about the it system since it opened a complaints system two years ago , a number they said represents a ‘ tiny fraction ’ of the 500,000 people who had used the system ‘ effectively ’			0
a spokesman said : ‘ in none of @entity1 ’s own work , nor through any of @entity12 ’s work , has any information emerged to suggest that a conviction is unsafe			2
’ but @entity104 , of the @entity105 , said : ‘ this is another damning report which reiterates the serious concerns of many postmasters			0
part of the problem throughout has been the bullish behaviour of the @entity1 towards postmasters who feel that they are helpless victims of a computer system gone wrong			2
’ sacked : @entity117 @entity116 , 57 a subpostmaster was pursued to the brink of ruin and his wife left contemplating suicide after being prosecuted by the @entity1			2
@entity116 , 57 , believes action was taken against him after he allegedly discovered that data in branches could be altered remotely – potentially explaining mystery cash shortfalls			0
the day after mr @entity116 expressed concern at the revelation , a @entity1 auditor turned up at his shop in @entity131 , @entity132 , to tell him £ 44,000 was unaccounted for			2
‘ my world was turned upside down , ’ he said , adding : ‘ i became like a drowning man with no life raft			0
’ despite insisting he never saw a penny of the ‘ missing ’ funds , mr @entity116 was forced to repay the money and his wife @entity139 , 60 , who did most of the day - to - day running of the branch , was prosecuted and given a suspended prison sentence			0
mr @entity116 had his contract terminated while his wife was left ‘ contemplating suicide ’ after her conviction .			0
