by @entity0 more @entity2 superdelegates are boycotting their party ’s convention in @entity5 amid fears that any association with president @entity8 will doom them to defeat in november			1
representatives @entity9 and @entity11 of @entity12 , who both won special elections in seats previously held by @entity15 , have joined four democrats from the @entity17 in skipping the @entity2 convention in @entity19 at the start of september			1
@entity21 told @entity22 : ‘ i guarantee that my time will be better spent meeting the farmers , small business owners and other people who put me here			1
' in an excuse not much more convincing than ‘ i ’m washing my hair ’ , a spokesman for @entity28 insisted : ‘ he just has a packed schedule back home			1
’ beleaguered : president @entity8 has now been abandoned by six @entity2 superdelegates staying away : @entity9 , left , and @entity11 , right , both representatives from @entity12 , will not be at the @entity2 convention to cast a vote for mr @entity8 's re-election at least six superdelegates , given a vote in the presidential nomination process because of their status as senior elected officials , will not be casting their ballots for @entity8			1
on tuesday , representative @entity46 of @entity47 , who has just won a tough @entity2 primary in a newly - drawn district , said he had decided to stay at home rather than travel to @entity19 for @entity8 ’s formal nomination in early september			1
‘ since i was elected , my focus has been on creating jobs for people here , rather than focusing on the agendas of the political parties in @entity59 , ' he told the @entity60			2
on monday , governor @entity61 , senator @entity62 and representative @entity63 , all seeking re-election this year , announced they would not go to @entity19			2
opponent : @entity67 will take heart from mr @entity8 's struggle to hold on to his support a @entity61 spokesman said the governor had ‘ serious problems ’ with both @entity8 and @entity67 , the presumptive @entity15 nominee			2
‘ the governor feels that his time is best spent working in @entity76 to move our state forward instead of attending a four - day political rally in @entity5			2
’ @entity62 said in a statement : ‘ i intend to spend this fall focused on the people of @entity76 , whether that ’s representing them in my official @entity84 duties or here at home , where i can hear about their concerns and ideas to solve the problems of this great nation			2
’ last month , the @entity62 refused even to say whether he would vote for @entity8 , stating that ‘ i ’ll look at the option ’ , adding that the last four years ‘ have made it pretty rough ’ for @entity76			2
@entity8 lost @entity76 by 18 percentage points in 2008 after having been trounced there by @entity93 in the @entity2 primary			2
his poor showing there , and in industrial areas of neighbouring @entity47 , underlined his difficulties in attracting white , blue collar voters			2
that problem has only increased since he was elected , the economy has faltered and unemployment nationally has risen to 8.2 per cent			2
@entity62 has expressed his dismay with @entity8 ’s stances on coal and energy issues , arguing that he is backing environmentalists over workers			0
boycott : @entity46 of @entity47 , left , and @entity76 's governor @entity61 , right , have decided not to attend the @entity2 convention in @entity19 in september senator @entity112 of @entity76 will attend the convention but he is not facing re-election this year			1
@entity115 , @entity116 chairman , told the @entity60 that he suspects that other candidates for the @entity118 would stay at home rather than join the celebration in @entity19 , where @entity8 will be re-nominated in a 70,000 - seater stadium			1
‘ like @entity46 , that is the right thing for them to do			0
they should be home winning votes , not be seen at a party			1
’ in 2008 , @entity62 , then @entity76 ’s governor , spoke at the convention in @entity129 and urged @entity2 to vote for @entity8			1
‘ my fellow @entity131 , we need a new leader for new times			0
@entity8 is the only candidate in this race who has captured our nation 's hopes for the kind of change we so desperately need			0
let 's do what 's right for @entity131 and elect @entity8 as the next president of the @entity131			0
’ since he won a special election in november 2010 to replace the late senator @entity144 , however , he has become an @entity8 critic , in part at least to preserve his hopes of being elected to a full six - year term this year			0
he said last month : ‘ i ’m worried about me			0
i ’ve said it ’s not a team sport			0
you need to go out and work for yourself			0
@entity46 is due to face @entity153 , a @entity15 , in a district that will be tough for any @entity156 after @entity157 won there by eight points in 2008			0
@entity159 , @entity46 ’s campaign spokesman , said that internal polling showed @entity8 was down double digits to @entity67 in the redrawn district			0
he added that this made the decision to skip the convention ‘ pretty easy ’ and ‘ it is fair to say ’ that @entity46 would not ask @entity8 to campaign with him			1
lukewarm support : @entity76 congressmen @entity62 , left , and @entity63 , right , have refused to commit wholeheartedly to the president @entity2 outnumber @entity15 by nearly two to one in @entity76 and @entity2 politicians hold 70 percent of local elected offices there , but @entity8 is so unpopular that @entity67 is virtually guaranteed to win the state			1
staying away from the convention will not stop @entity15 opponents from tying the four boycotting superdelegates from the @entity17 to @entity8			1
@entity177 , seeking to unseat @entity176 , demanded that the @entity156 go to @entity19 to vote against @entity8 ’s nomination			0
‘ @entity61 has chosen to support @entity8 by not going to his own convention to vote against the president , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity8 and his job - killing policies are hurting @entity182			0
it is now clear that @entity61 supports @entity8 and his policies			0
’ the absence of a number of superdelegates will add to a number of headaches for @entity8 surrounding the @entity19 convention			1
unions are furious that @entity5 will host the convention because they view the state as unfriendly to labour			1
the state ’s unpopular @entity2 governor @entity195 has opted not to seek re-election			0
@entity198 , the state party chairman , is being sued by a male former employee who left his job after he accused the male party executive director of sexual harassment			1
the executive director ’s ex-girlfriend then stated he had contracted @entity206 from him			0
one of @entity5 ’s most prominent @entity2 , @entity207 , has just narrowly escaped being convicted of corruption charges after admitting fathering a child from an affair conducted while his wife was dying of cancer			0
most democrats are increasingly pessimistic about @entity8 ’s chances of winning @entity5 , where he just prevailed over @entity157 four years ago .			0
