nursery costs have soared by 30 per cent in three years , almost five times faster than average wages			1
labour leader @entity3 warned many parents are now ‘ struggling to cope ’ and rising costs mean they spend much of the week working just to cover childcare bills			1
. he called for a new levy on banks to fund extra childcare for three - and four - year - olds , in the latest assault on the government over the cost of living			1
nonsense : mr @entity3 said it was ridiculous that some parents spent most of the week working just to pay for childcare costs in 2010 the average cost of a nursery place for a child aged two or over for 25 - hours - a - week was £ 82			1
but this year it has hit £ 107 , while average weekly earnings have only risen 6 per cent from £ 449 to £ 477 over the last three years			1
it is adding to the pressure on family finances , with energy bills due to rise by up to 10 per cent this winter			2
mr @entity3 accused the coalition government of doing ‘ nothing to help ’ families and has added stress to family life			1
on a visit to a nursery today , mr @entity3 said : ‘ millions of parents are facing a childcare crunch			1
the cost of a nursery place is now the highest in history , at more than £ 100 a week to cover part - time hours			1
‘ and average costs for a full - time place are now rising up to £ 200 or even more			1
‘ that means a typical parent doing a part - time job would have to work from monday until thursday just to cover these costs of childcare			2
‘ rising prices have been matched only by falling numbers of places			0
’ he added : ‘ the @entity51 say they care about families but they have done nothing to help for three years while all the time adding to the stress and strain of family life			1
‘ if it 's bad for families , it 's bad for @entity59 too			0
parents who want to work should be able to do so			0
we need to use the talents of everyone if we are to succeed as an economy and keep social security bills down			0
’ @entity3 met nursery manager @entity66 and three year old @entity67 during the visit to promote his policy to offer more free childcare labour leader @entity3 was today forced to deny thinking his shadow chancellor @entity71 is a ' nightmare ' to work with			1
leaked emails reveal how the pair are deeply divided over how to respond to the economic revival			0
they suggested the leader is sick and tired of the shadow chancellor ’s refusal to obey his orders and ‘ stay on message ’			2
but today mr @entity3 denied a rift , telling @entity84 's @entity83 : ' it ’s fair to say that people send silly emails in offices and this was one of them			1
' @entity3 and i are working really well together , i ’m really proud to have him as the shadow chancellor working alongside me			2
' he ’s somebody who i think has been right in his criticism of the government ’s economic policy and he ’s also leading the way on this cost of living crisis that we ’ve been talking about			2
so , as i say , people send silly emails in offices but that ’s all it is			0
' @entity103 accused the government of overseeing the closure of 576 fewer @entity107 centres since the last general election , removing childcare places			0
but the @entity110 disputed the figures , claiming only 45 @entity107 centres have shut down since 2010 and new ones have opened with a record number of parents using them			0
in september mr @entity3 unveiled @entity103 's childcare policy , including an extension of free childcare for three and four - year - olds from 15 to 25 hours a week for working parents			1
today the @entity103 leader said big banks should pay for the extra help for parents			2
it would be the equivalent of about £ 1,500 a year saving for families , he said			2
‘ childcare costs ... are just going up and up and up and parents are really struggling to cope , ’ he told @entity84 's @entity83			0
‘ the banks are actually making very big profits and i think they can afford a bit more to help families , ’ he said			0
‘ it 's one of those things that is going to be good for the country , because not every parent is going to want to work ... but seven out of 10 mums are saying “ i want to go back to work but i ca n't because of the cost of childcare ”			0
‘ they 're going to have to work all week to pay for their childcare costs and that 's just a nonsense			0
’ @entity148 , @entity149 at @entity150 said : ' families from all backgrounds face rising childcare costs			0
however , in a time of stretched budgets , supporting high quality care for children from deprived backgrounds offers greater value for money than subsidies to the richest parents			0
' that ’s why parents earning as much as £ 150,000 a year should have their tax - free childcare entitlement cut with the savings of up to £ 238m used to improve the quality of childcare in the poorest areas of the country			1

cost of a 25 - hour weekly nursery place has risen from £ 82 in 2010 to £ 107
but average wages in the last three years are only up six per cent
labour leader @entity3 wants to *guarantee* *8am* - *6pm* care
will tax the banks to fund 25 hours of free care for 2 and 3 - year - olds
