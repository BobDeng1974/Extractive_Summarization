as @entity1 led an angry touchline delegation in pursuit of fourth official @entity4 , the entire section of @entity7 supporters who sit behind the visitors ’ bench climbed to their feet to hurl their abuse			1
as they settled back into their seats , the rest of the @entity13 exploded into verse about @entity1 , with advice as to where he should go			1
the @entity21 manager and his assistant @entity22 had been complaining about the charge from goal by goalkeeper @entity25 which flattened @entity27 in the first half , but which was not adjudged to be a foul			1
@entity30 returned to @entity13 for the first time since leaving for @entity32 in 2011 @entity33 of @entity7 evades @entity30 of @entity21 during the 0 - 0 draw at @entity13 on sunday every @entity30 touch was booed as he operated in the first half in a deep role alongside @entity37 @entity38 - without his mask on - swaps shirts and salutes the @entity13 crowd at full time the pass to @entity27 had been wonderfully delivered by @entity30 , masked villain of the day in this @entity44 postcode , having the temerity to return in blue nearly four years after agitating to leave @entity7 for @entity32			1
every @entity30 touch was booed			2
and he did n’t hide			0
he was influential , operating in the first half in a deep role alongside @entity37 , from where he is often more creative , before moving forward after the break into a @entity50 role ( and removing the protective mask )			2
there were a lot of touches and a lot of boos			0
he rarely misplaced a pass but when he did the home crowd cheered			0
and no cheer was louder than the one when referee @entity60 booked him for a dive			0
it might not , in fact , have been a dive			0
@entity65 and @entity30 collided knee - to - knee but the @entity21 midfielder also trailed a leg in search of contact more definite and made the it all seem a little too contrived			1
@entity60 was on the spot			0
so much so that a split - second earlier , he had made a better effort than @entity65 at winning the ball			0
the referee ruled in @entity7 ’s favour , and this proved a very popular decision			2
there was a rare energy about the @entity13 and noise levels not normally associated with the stadium			2
make no mistake , this one mattered to those in red			0
it mattered beyond the confines of the 90 minutes and the points won and lost in what remains of this title race			0
it was about next season			0
how close are @entity95 ’s team to challenging @entity21 for the title ? can they alter the balance of power in the capital ? can they close the gap at the top of the @entity103 ? of course there were a couple of hate - figures in the vicinity			1
animosity levels were up but @entity7 have been brilliant since the turn of the year , with one notable exception , and this was an opportunity to make a statement			2
@entity21 midfielder @entity27 had to be replaced at half - time after a painful - looking collision with @entity25 @entity95 ( left ) has not beaten @entity21 boss @entity1 ( right ) in 13 games as the hoodoo continues @entity65 of @entity7 reacts after a missed chance during his side 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity21 it was time to get over the players they did n’t sign and get behind those they did			1
@entity1 showed respect to @entity127 by starting with @entity128 wide on the right to offer defensive cover and limiting @entity132 ’s involvement as an attacking force , preferring the muscular @entity134 to mind the @entity135			2
there were flashes of what @entity7 do well and supporters rejoiced in flourishes , like a back - heel or two by @entity142 or a sliver of skill from @entity145 , but they could not beat @entity146			1
@entity7 fans sang : ' @entity21 ' when they failed to penetrate , and the jeers for @entity30 were transformed into applause when he was substituted in the last minute			1
by then the game seemed destined to end goalless			0
@entity21 , had reverted to the six - man defensive shield at half - time by dropping @entity128 deeper , and finished the game with centre - half @entity154 also in central midfield			1
@entity1 was determined to leave with the clean sheet he came for and , left the more satisfied of the two managers			2
they remain on course for the title and celebrated at the final whistle			0
@entity95 , meanwhile , can not crack the jose - hoodoo			1
there is work to do in the summer if this gap is to be closed			0
fabregas of @entity21 appeals as he is booked by referee @entity60 on his first return to @entity7 @entity30 struggled to settle at @entity172 giants @entity32 and signed for @entity21 last summer @entity7 players mark the upcoming anniversary of the @entity176 fire disaster with a minutes silence			1
