@entity0 believes @entity1 deserves to pip @entity2 to the player of the year award			1
that two forwards are the leading contenders to scoop the @entity7 accolade after their nominations this week			0
hazard is the red hot favourite to land the prize after his excellent season with @entity13			0
@entity1 has been nominated for @entity14 after a standout season for @entity16 @entity17 boss @entity0 says @entity1 deserves to win the award for his impact on @entity21 football but @entity0 says @entity1 , who could become the first @entity17 player to score 30 goals in a season since @entity25 achieved the feat 27 years ago , should take the award			1
' i think that @entity2 is a very good player , he 's fantastic , a great player			1
but the impact that @entity1 has had on @entity21 football is massive			1
' maybe the impact is bigger than @entity2 and his performances			1
' everyone knew that @entity2 is a brilliant player			1
' but i think not too many people expected that @entity1 would show the performances that he has this season			1
@entity1 will have to beat off competition from @entity2 if he is to claim individual gong @entity1 's scintillating form in front of goal this season has earned him international recognition @entity2 - @entity13 @entity41 - @entity13 @entity1 - @entity17 @entity43 - @entity42 @entity45 - @entity44 @entity47 - @entity46 this is the difference i believe			1
' meanwhile , @entity0 has defended the club 's decision to play a one off pre-season game against the @entity53 in @entity54 on july 29			1
in the past , the @entity55 has spoken out against the idea of summer tours in long haul destinations			0
but @entity0 , who are also travelling to @entity59 and @entity60 for a post-season tour , said : ' it 's only one game			2
we go there and back			0
' it 's nine hours			0
it 's very important for us because it 's a very important game because it 's against the all - star with the biggest stars , it 's only one game , it 's after three weeks training here			2
@entity1 has scored 29 goals in all competitions for @entity17 this season ' i think it 's a good possibility to go on monday and come back after the game on wednesday			2
' we only spend three days			0
it 's not a pre-season tour where you spend maybe 14 - 15 days away			2
' on a pre-season , you need good pitches for training			0
you have a problem with traffic like happened on the last pre-season tour			0
it 's not proper to prepare			0
' it 's a good possibility because it 's a prestigious match			0
maybe we 'll play against @entity89 or @entity90 - a very good test for us			2
