@entity10 scientists have highlighted how @entity2 has some striking similarities to @entity8 ’s satellite , particularly in relation to its geological history			2
at the recent @entity16 conference held at the @entity17 , @entity18 , scientists said that the finding could shed light on a popular theory on how the moon was created			1
@entity2 ( pictured ) , the closest planet to our sun , may hold the key to understanding how the @entity8 's moon was formed @entity25 , the principal investigator for @entity10 ’s messenger mission to @entity2 , told @entity27 that the similarities show that @entity8 and the moon are not unique in having a similar isotopic composition			1
he said , ‘ aspects of the moon are common to rocky bodies that are similar in size despite being different in bulk composition			0
’ there is currently no theory that can fully answer all the questions about how the moon formed			1
the most popular theory is that the moon formed when a planet , around the size of @entity43 , collided with @entity8 around 4.56 billion years ago			1
the most popular theory is that the moon formed when a planet , around the size of @entity43 , collided with @entity8 around 4.56 billion years ago this collision divided @entity8 into two unequal parts			1
the smaller of these condensed into the moon			0
the best simulations of this process suggest that about 80 per cent of moon ought to have come from the impactor and 20 per cent from the @entity8			0
the hypothesis , however , has been called into question by measurements that find that the @entity8 and @entity57 have the same isotopic composition			0
in march this year , the messenger spacecraft finished mapping the @entity2 ’s entire surface , and scientists are now ploughing through the data that was beamed back			2
one of the most significant findings is the similarities in geological history of both the moon and @entity2			2
just like the moon , a part of @entity2 's surface is relatively smooth			1
on @entity2 , the smooth area covers 27 per cent of the surface ; on the moon this is around 16 per cent			2
the surface of @entity2 ( left ) and the @entity57 ( right ) has some striking similarities			2
@entity2 's ancient cratered land has a very similar topography and age to that of the moon scientists believe these areas were formed billions of years ago from volcanic eruptions that covered the surface with lava			1
@entity2 's ancient cratered land also has a very similar topography and age to that of the moon			1
both bodies have polar ice deposits and also have two sides that are strikingly different from each other			0
@entity25 believes to get a better understanding of how the moon formed we need to get a sample from @entity2			1
if @entity2 happens to be isotopically similar , it could suggest that the objects that collided to grow the final stages of the @entity8 and created the moon were made out of similar material			2
‘ if there was [ such a process ] , ’ said @entity25 , ‘ all our puzzles about why the @entity57 and @entity8 are so similar isotopically then evaporate			0
’ a controversial theory has been proposed that a giant explosion equivalent to 40 billion atomic bombs originating from the @entity8 's core somehow led to the formation of the moon			0
planetary scientist @entity111 believes this violent event took place approximately four - and - a - half billion years ago and could answer the hotly contested question of where our moon comes from			0
the scientist , from @entity118 in @entity119 , told @entity121 magazine that previous explanations about how the moon came to be simply do not add @entity125 analysis of the rocks last year by the @entity127 found that they shared identical oxygen , silicon and potassium isotopes with @entity8 , hinting that the @entity57 shares its origin with the @entity8			0
@entity132 said that taken at face value , the findings suggest that the moon was once part of the @entity8 that was blasted into space by an enormous explosion from the @entity8 's fiery core			0
to do this , he believes that there must have been a ' massive energy kick ' delivered quickly and he calculates that the explosion was the strength of 40 billion atomic bombs the size of those dropped on @entity148 .			0

just like the moon , a part of @entity2 's surface is relatively smooth
its cratered land also has a similar topography and age to that of the moon
scientists propose that @entity2 and the moon may be *chemically* similar
this provides evidence in support of popular theory on how moon formed
