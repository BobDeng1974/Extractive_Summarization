@entity0 is hoping @entity1 can take their relegation fight to the final day where he has a remarkable record of success			1
the @entity1 manager has twice before worked last - match miracles in charge of teams in trouble and would love the opportunity to complete a hat - trick			1
‘ of course i would			0
i ’ve been in plenty , ’ said @entity0			2
@entity0 barks orders from the bench at @entity15 as @entity1 manage only a draw to @entity17 @entity0 knows he 's in a scrap for survival in the @entity20 but fighting to the end is n't new to him @entity1 , rooted to the bottom of the @entity20 and seven points from safety , look to have bleak prospects of reaching that stage still in contention to avoid the drop			1
the draw against @entity17 was a significant opportunity missed			0
but @entity0 has history of achieving the improbable			2
in his first manager ’s job at @entity34 he masterminded one of the most famous last day survival acts when goalkeeper @entity37 struck decisively with the last kick of their @entity40 season in 1998 - 99			1
nine years later @entity0 was brought in to take charge of @entity42 , struggling in the @entity43 , and guided the team to safety with a last - gasp victory			1
he was also @entity47 ’s assistant when @entity48 stayed up against the odds in the final game of the 2004 - 05 @entity20 campaign			1
@entity1 's @entity52 fights to dispossess @entity17 's @entity53 in a disappointing draw @entity1 keeper @entity55 punches clear despite the jumps of @entity57 ( @entity17 ) and @entity58 he is aware @entity1 , without a @entity20 victory in eight games , must start wining soon to have any chance and he was disappointed with his team ’s display			1
‘ it ’s another opportunity lost against a side who we needed to pick up three points against , ’ he said			0
‘ in some ways i ’d stomach us losing the game being more positive trying to win it , than picking up a point having been a bit safe			2
@entity75 will tell whether that is the right way to look at it or not			0
‘ ( the gap ) is a lot at this stage of the season			2
we ’re going to have to turn our form on its head			0
the point is we ’ve got to perform			0
the players know we have n’t done enough to win the game			0
i would like to have seen us show a bit more intent			0

@entity0 twice orchestrated last - day survival miracles as a manager
in his first job as manager he kept @entity34 in @entity40 in 1998 - 99
@entity42 fought until the final day of the season nine years later
bottom @entity1 have n't won a @entity20 game in eight starts
