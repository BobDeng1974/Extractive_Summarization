for the first time , astronomers have found the building blocks of life in a distant early star system			1
scientists detected the complex organic molecules in a disk of gas and dust around a star 455 light years away where planets are likely to be forming			2
the discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on @entity17 are not unique to our solar system			1
scientists detected the complex organic molecules in a disc of gas around an infant star 455 light years away where planets are likely to be forming			2
the discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on @entity17 are not unique to our solar system radio telescope observations showed the disk surrounding the million - year - old star @entity31 480 to be ' brimming ' with the complex carbon - based molecule methyl cyanide			1
both this molecule and its simpler organic cousin hydrogen cyanide were identified in the cold outer reaches of the newly formed disc			0
the region can be compared with our solar system 's @entity38 , a realm of icy mini-worlds and comets beyond @entity44			0
experts believe comets and asteroids from the outer solar system seeded the young @entity17 with water and organic molecules to set the stage for life to evolve			1
astronomers used the @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in @entity60 's @entity59 desert , to investigate @entity31 480			1
@entity55 's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive , but thrive astronomer dr @entity63 , from the @entity64 in @entity65 , said : ' studies of comets and asteroids show that the solar nebula that spawned our sun and planets was rich in water and complex organic compounds			2
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond @entity17 in the next decade , ' said @entity79 , chief scientist for @entity80 , ( pictured ) there at least 200 billion @entity17 - like planets in our galaxy â€“ and now @entity80 officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them			1
during a talk in @entity91 yesterday , the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade			0
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond @entity17 in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' said @entity79 , chief scientist for @entity80			2
' we know where to look , we know how to look , and in most cases we have the technology			0
' @entity98 , interim director of heliophysics at the agency , added : ' it 's definitely not an if , it 's a when			0
' ' we are not talking about little green men , ' @entity79 said			0
' we are talking about little microbes			0
' ' we now have evidence that this same chemistry exists elsewhere in the universe , in regions that could form solar systems not unlike our own			0
' the molecules surrounding @entity31 480 have been detected in similar concentrations in our own solar system 's comets , she pointed out			1
the star , which is about twice as massive as the sun , lies in a well - studied star - forming region in the constellation @entity120			2
astronomers used the @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in @entity60 's @entity59 desert , to investigate @entity31 480			1
previously it was unclear whether complex organic molecules commonly survive the shocks and radiation levels found in a newly forming solar system @entity55 's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive , but thrive			2
the findings , reported in the journal nature , reveal that there is enough methyl cyanide around @entity31 to fill all of the @entity17 's oceans			1
among complex organic molecules , cyanides - especially methyl cyanide - are important because they contain carbon - nitrogen bonds essential for the formation of amino acids , the components of proteins			1
as the @entity31 480 system evolves it is likely that organic molecules locked away in comets and other icy bodies will be ferried closer to the star where conditions may be suitable for life , the scientists believe			1
dr @entity63 added : ' from the study of exoplanets , we know our solar system is n't unique in having rocky planets and an abundance of water			0
' now we know we 're not unique in organic chemistry			0
once more , we have learned that we 're not special			0
from a life in the universe point of view , this is great news			0

million - year - old star @entity31 480 is ' brimming ' with carbon - based molecules
scientists say there is enough methyl cyanide to fill all of @entity17 's oceans .
as @entity31 evolves it is likely the molecules will move closer to the star
here , the conditions may be suitable for life to flourish , scientists believe
