by @entity0 you 've always got to support your friends in life and last night was no exception - @entity4 , who is on the made in @entity6 tv show with me , had her book launch at top @entity12 nightclub @entity10 just off @entity13			1
she 's hugely popular on the show - and after over three years on @entity0 together we still get on really well ( probably because she 's always been sensible enough not to get romantically involved with me			2
) there were several of the cast in attendance , as well as friends , family , and the publishing team from @entity24 to help celebrate the launch of @entity26 ( so far ) of @entity4			1
last night @entity0 joined @entity4 for the launch of her book - @entity30 it 's been a lot of hard work and effort from @entity35 - and the finished autobiography looks totes amaze			1
a lilac - coloured tome all about her life and loves , some great pictures of her growing up , plus some handy older - sister type hints on how to get through girl 's issues ( boys , bullies , parents , make - up etc ) - it will soon be on bookshelves ( this thursday 8th may )			0
i 'm told there 's quite a bit about me in the book - all glowing reports , i 'm sure			0
poor old @entity4 had a bit of bad luck with the traffic coming from filming out all the way from @entity61 in @entity62 , and so was quite a bit more than fashionably late			0
but she looked utterly gorgeous in a rather expensive @entity66 jacket when she arrived so she was immediately forgiven			0
@entity4 's first book will give ' big sister advice ' on boys , bullies and beauty @entity4 was joined by @entity0 cast members old and new , @entity73 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) and ex @entity0 star @entity74 ( far right ) i rocked up with @entity6 bad - boy @entity76 who runs the @entity78 luxury motor event and the party started in earnest			1
ciroc vodka was flowing , but @entity4 was being good only had the one @entity82 ( single vodka , lime and fresh soda ) because she is currently in full work - out mode and using @entity88 supplements to get in incredible shape			2
she has a big lingerie photo - shoot for @entity91 later this week and wants to look her best , but we more than made up for her abstinence on the drink front			0
of course @entity0 was there to witness her daughter 's proud moment diamond jeweller @entity99 ( left ) offered to make @entity0 an engagement ring - @entity0 politely declined as he thought he would n't have much use for it			1
his @entity6 chum @entity76 joined him ( right ) @entity0 and singer @entity105 wore matching leopard print accessories to the launch top diamond jeweller @entity99 was invited because he 's loaning jewellery from his company @entity110 for @entity4 's photo shoot , and he offered to make me a three - carat engagement ring - but it 's unlikely i 'll need one of those for at least 10 years			1
i had a good chat with @entity4 's mum @entity118 before @entity119 arrived - we always get on famously , i think partly because she knows that her daughter has got far too much sense than to get involved with a reprobate like me			1
also at the party was @entity74 and @entity0 , looking immaculate as always - but surprisingly @entity0 was wearing high street - as opposed to @entity128 - @entity127 skirt , @entity130 top , @entity132 cape ( admittedly those are n't cheap ) , and some gorgeous @entity135 shoes			1
@entity4 seemed to be getting along famously with latest @entity0 cast member @entity73 ( left ) and her friend @entity137 ( right ) on the subject of shoes and accessories , leopard print is in			1
well according to singer @entity105 and yours truly			0
we were both rocking a pair of racy print footwear and we threw some shapes when the @entity147 played her latest single @entity148 which @entity4 appears in the video for			0
it 's always a pleasant surprise to see the gorgeous @entity73 and she wore a revealing backless dress with a buckle choker , and she was accompanied by @entity137 who was showing a tasteful glimpse of décolleté			2
all the book - worms left and were on their way home to bed by 10pm , and so we thought it was best to take @entity73 and her friend @entity163 and find an after - party to go			2
all the best , @entity0			0
being @entity4 by @entity4 published by @entity164 8 may , price £ 12.99			0
available at @entity166 for £ 6			0

@entity0 joined the @entity0 cast at @entity10 for @entity4 's book launch
@entity0 said that he and @entity4 are good friends because they never dated
he describes her book as ' totes amaze ' with lots of good advice
after the launch @entity0 could n't resist *sneaking* off to a party with @entity73
