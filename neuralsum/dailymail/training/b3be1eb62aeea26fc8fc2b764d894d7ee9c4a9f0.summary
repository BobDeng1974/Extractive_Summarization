former @entity1 gov. @entity0 once tangled with a @entity3 reporter over media coverage of his daughter @entity5 's drug - related legal troubles , complaining in an email that ' i wish the media would leave my daughter alone			1
' @entity5 was arrested in 2002 at age 25 for prescription drug fraud , stealing pills at a rehab clinic , and possession of crack cocaine			2
a feeding frenzy of @entity1 journalists scrambled to report on every angle of the story , including links between a judge overseeing her rehab progress and a charity that received state government money			1
the implication was that @entity5 , who spent less than two weeks in jail overall , received special treatment because her judge appreciated the grants – $ 900,000 in all – made to the charity on whose board he had sat. @entity0 wrote directly to the reporter in january 2003 , and his email was part of a massive data dump he released to the public on friday , redefining political transparency in the run - up to the 2016 election			1
' @entity42 ' : @entity0 emailed a @entity3 reporter in 2003 to complain about how she was covering his daughter 's drug - related court appearances @entity47 , daughter of @entity1 's then - governor @entity0 , was originally arrested for trying to fill a @entity49 prescription written to someone else the trove of electronic data , more than 8 gigabytes in all , immediately attracted critiism , though , for the taxpayers ' private information it contained			1
@entity57 conducted a complete search of the data and identified 14 separate @entity61 numbers			1
most of the emails containing the word ' @entity5 ' were from well - wishers , with a majority saying they were praying – many every day – for her			1
' it wo n't matter in the whole scheme of things , ' @entity0 scolded the journalist on january 15 , 2003 , ' but i wish the media would leave my daughter alone			2
it would make it a whole lot easy [ sic ] for her to recover and live a life full of hope and promise			0
' pointing out what he saw as a tenuous connection between the judge and the government grants , the exasperated governor sniped that ' based on your definition of possible conflict , i guess i should not subscribe to the @entity3 so you and your colleagues can report objectively			1
' ' it is that trivial , ' he added in a follow - up email after the reporter defended herself			0
' the only reason you wrote the piece , or were told to write the piece , is that my struggling daughter is the child of the governor			2
' @entity47 was first taken into custody at a drive - through pharmacy window while her father was governor in january 2002 , charged with trying to buy the often abused anti-anxiety drug @entity49 with a prescription written for someone else			1
although a judge gave her a break and sent her to an inpatient drug treatment program , and said her criminal charge could be dropped if she succeeded , she was caught at the facility with pills that had been stolen from a cabinet			0
she spent two days in jail			0
back at the treatment center , workers found her with a 0.2 gram rock of crack cocaine concealed in her shoe two months later			0
in october 2002 at a progress hearing , a judge sent @entity5 to jail for 10 days , basing his decision in part on news of the crack incident			2
@entity0 learned of the jail sentence while campaigning for re-election			2
from the day the cocaine was found , through his daughter 's sentencing , he played the part of compassionate father while carefully maintaining the tough - on - crime image that made him popular politically			1
when news of the crack bust reached news media , he said his daughter needed to ' resolve in her heart and mind that she needs to change			0
she needs to accept responsibility , ' he insisted			0
' she knows that we love her , ' the then - governor and re-election candidate continued			0
' she knows a whole lot of people care for her , but it is up to her			0
' weeks later when @entity5 was led away in handcuffs to begin her short stint behind bars , he addressed the growing media frenzy again			2
' as governor , but most importantly as her father , ' he said , ' i know she must face the consequences of her actions			0
' in one email to a sympathetic constituent , he wrote : ' thank you katherine for your sympathies regarding @entity5			0
i love her more than life			0
' @entity165 : @entity0 stood by his daughter , appearing with her in court despite being the sitting governor of @entity1 revolving door : ms. @entity47 was in and out of drug rehab with a few brief stays in jail as she struggled to get clean @entity1 's open records laws are among the strongest in the nation , meaning the emails released tuesday – all of those sent to and from @entity0 's personal email address from 1999 to 2007 – have long been open to public review			1
they account for a sliver of the @entity0 archive , and do n't include emails sent to and from his official government email address , as well as other records such as office notes and calendars			1
but by cracking open his @entity187 for inspection on a new website , and pairing it with what amounts to a reader 's guide to the hundreds of thousands of messages , many only a few words long , @entity0 is able to shape how the emails define him among his would - be @entity197 primary opponents and @entity198 already trying to paint him as an out - of - touch businessman little different than 2012 nominee @entity200			1
in a chapter of an e-book whose release accompanied the email data , @entity0 cast himself as being readily accessible , to the point that he freely gave his personal email address to constituents			2
' as much as i could , i emailed back , ' he writes , describing the experience as ' quite humbling ' at times , but ' always eye opening , and ( it ) certainly kept me on my toes			0

emails released tuesday by the @entity1 governor show a father frustrated by reporters ' eagerness to cover his daughter 's legal woes
a @entity225 reporter had written that a judge overseeing @entity47 's case was linked to a charity that received $ 900,000 in state government grants
the vast majority of emails mentioning @entity5 's name were *supportive* , with most offering prayers for her recovery
as @entity0 aims for the *presidency* he 's redefining the idea of political transparency by releasing a massive archive of all his official emails
@entity57 found 14 different @entity243 in the data
