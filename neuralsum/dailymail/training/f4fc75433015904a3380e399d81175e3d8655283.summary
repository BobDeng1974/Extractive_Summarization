@entity0 , 51 , has been driving a garbage truck in the streets of @entity3 , and not even his son 's multimillion - dollar contract could change that			1
the father of @entity10 corner @entity8 says he still wakes up at 3.45am and works holidays for the overtime because he does n't want his son to worry about taking care of him			1
' my son is an @entity17 player , but i do n't want my son taking care of me the rest of my life , ' he told @entity22			1
but he told the @entity33 back in 2014 he wanted to keep working towards retirement and his pension			0
' people say , " let your son take care of you , " ' the elder @entity0 , who lost an eye in a go - karting accident when he was 14 , told the paper			1
' yeah , but i 've got a few years left until i retire			0
why would i mess up my own retirement ? ' i have a medical plan that will cover me			0
why should my son have to pay my medical bills ? it does n't make sense to me			2
' @entity51 reports that @entity0 is now only 18 months from retiring after 26 years on the job driving the streets of @entity26			2
' it 's something to keep busy , and it 's easy now , ' he said			0
' if i take a day off , i do n't need to worry about where my money is coming from			2
' better luck : @entity8 signed a $ 56million contract in the off - season last year , and came up just shy of a second @entity29 ring proud pop : the @entity60 have memorabilia of their son filling a room of their home , and @entity0 remembers being awed by his son 's performance at the @entity69 game work ethic : @entity8 , who was a straight - a student before attending @entity71 and going on to the @entity17 , credits his parents for instilling a strong work ethic @entity8 has credited his father and his mother , @entity76 , who works with disabled kids in poor urban areas , for instilling a strong sense of discipline and work ethic			1
and just because he says he 's not going to depend on his son , does n't mean that the elder @entity0 is n't proud of his accomplishments			1
he played as a kid at @entity85 , though his athletic ability was hindered by a go - kart accident that cost him his right eye			0
at the nfc championship game last season where @entity0 deflected a would - be touchdown pass to save a @entity10 victory , @entity0 remembers savoring the moment			2
' i sat there for a good 30 minutes after the game was over , ' he told the @entity33			0
' it was kind of a proud moment , you know ? i had to sit there and gather myself , then i headed down to where the parents go			0

@entity0 , 51 , still drives a garbage collection truck in @entity3
he says he does n't want his son , who signed a $ 56million contract last year , to have to take care of him
@entity8 credits his discipline and work ethics to his father and mother , @entity76 , who works with disabled inner - city youth
