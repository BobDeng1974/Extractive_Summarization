by @entity0 crime boss : @entity2 has lost his libel claim against the @entity5 after it described him as an ' underworld king ' the @entity5 has won a libel action brought by a man it described as an ' underworld king '			1
@entity2 claimed the may 2010 article meant he was the head of a crime organisation who had been shown to be concerned with murder , drug trafficking and fraud			1
@entity2 's lawyers told @entity18 's @entity3 it was a libel of ' exceptional gravity ' and @entity2 himself gave evidence that the allegations were ' heartbreaking ' , had ' crucified ' him and impacted badly on his business relationships			1
the judge found that the newspaper was correct in saying that @entity2 had been violent and intimidating and that he was the head of an organisation involved in ' extreme violence and fraud '			1
but he did not hold that the @entity5 had proved his crime ring was involved in murder and drug trafficking			1
@entity35 defended its story - headlined ' underworld kings cash in on taxpayer land fund ' - on the basis that it was substantially true and responsible reporting on a matter of public interest			1
@entity2 's barrister , @entity41 , who is chairman of the hacked off campaign , attempted to discredit the reporter who wrote the story			1
however , after a 12 - day hearing earlier this year , mr justice @entity0 dismissed the case , saying that journalist @entity47 was highly experienced and gave evidence that was both lucid and entirely credible			2
mr @entity47 had been investigating @entity2 and his associates for about 11 years and during that time had obtained a significant amount of information which led him honestly to believe that @entity2 was a violent and dangerous criminal at the head of a family - based network			1
the judge said it was not a case in which a defendant ' embroidered the allegations with epithets and gratuitous adjectives ' , nor was there any evidence of embellishment of the facts			2
victory : the @entity5 has won a libel action at the @entity3 ( above ) brought by a man it described as an ' underworld king ' thrown out : mr @entity0 ( pictured ) dismissed attempts by @entity2 's lawyers to discredit the reporter who wrote the story he said : ' on the basis of the information mr @entity47 received from sources that he was entitled to treat as reliable and knowledgeable , as well as the information contained in documents , some of which i have referred to , i am satisfied that it was reasonable for him to describe the claimant as a violent and dangerous criminal and the head of an organised crime group implicated in murder , drug trafficking and fraud			1
' i am also satisfied that he honestly believed that the allegations were accurate and true , and that it was his duty to write the article in the form that it was published			2
' he added that mr @entity47 behaved fairly and responsibly in gathering the information and in ensuring what was published was accurate and fair			2
it was ' a serious piece of investigative journalism '			2
the judge said the newspaper had justified its case that there were grounds to suspect @entity2 was responsible for the intimidation of the main witnesses against him when he was prosecuted in 1999 for a violent assault , and that he attacked and threatened to kill a man at a court hearing and then avoided prosecution through intimidation			1
he added he had little difficulty in accepting it had justified that part of the meaning which related to @entity2 being the head of an organised crime network , implicated in extreme violence and fraud			1
he did not , however , accept that involvement in murder and drug - trafficking were necessarily included within a general description of a head of an organised crime network			1
the judge said the newspaper had produced evidence from a number of police officers that @entity2 was known as a major criminal , which was criticised by @entity2 's lawyers on the basis that the officers were simply reciting what they had read in confidential police documents which were based on unsubstantiated reports and rumours			1
@entity41 is renowend for keeping fighting privacy cases for this clients @entity2 was represented in his libel case against the @entity5 by renowned and controversial lawyer @entity41			1
mr @entity0 became known for keeping his clients - often celebrities and high - profile figures - anonymous by forging a career as a leading securer of privacy injunctions			2
' rules have been laid down , ' the 59 - year - old once told the @entity152			0
' the fact the law is difficult to enforce does n't mean you do n't try to enforce it			0
' the current legal position has got the balance essentially right			0
' the main point of contention is that the press say that if someone is having an adulterous affair , that 's something that should be exposed			0
' the judges do n't agree			0
' more recently , he has made a name for himself as the lawyer for the @entity169 pressure group , which is demanding state - backed regulation of the press			0
in may , a senior @entity172 mp used a @entity174 motion to launch an astonishing attack on mr @entity0 for ' acting against freedom of expression and the rule of law ' during his legal career			0
@entity180 criticised him for his role in bringing legal injunctions on behalf of celebrities			0
in his early day motion , mr @entity180 criticised mr @entity0 – a barrister based at @entity186 's @entity185 – for taking out the super-injunction which banned any mention of an affair between @entity190 and model @entity191			0
mr @entity180 also claimed that mr @entity0 helped to secure the ' secret imprisonment ' of a woman simply for ' writing emails '			0
he accused him of playing a key role in @entity196 being jailed after she sent emails to the @entity198 complaining that a solicitors ' firm had defrauded her mother using the @entity202			2
mr @entity0 's spokesman previously said the the motion contained ' a number of significant factual errors			0
' he added : ' mr @entity0 must take cases within his areas of expertise : he is not permitted to choose which cases to take based on his personal view			0
' the arguments he advances are based on the instructions of his clients			0
' mr @entity180 is entitled to criticise mr @entity0 's personal views , or the views of @entity169 , but he is not entitled to attribute to mr @entity0 the views and arguments of his clients			0

@entity2 sued @entity5 after it described him as ' underworld king '
@entity3 ruled it had proved @entity2 had been violent and was a crime boss
but accusation he headed ring involved in murder and drug trafficking was not proved
claim thrown out because reporter had acted responsibly and paper had proved key allegations
