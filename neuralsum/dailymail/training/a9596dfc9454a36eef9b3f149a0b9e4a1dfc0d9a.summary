no footballer wants to be out injured but how strange it can be when your stock rises during an enforced absence , as if you become a better player , at least among those who do n’t know what they ’ve got until it has gone			0
@entity10 sat on the bench at @entity12 , watching @entity13 chasing around in the chaos of a thrilling 2 - 2 draw , unable to strike the balance between adventure and caution			1
@entity19 insists he will never curb his desire to entertain but his team requires a keystone , a steadying influence to conduct its fabulous attackers , while offering a little help to those responsible for protecting the goal behind @entity28			0
@entity10 returned to the @entity13 squad for the draw with @entity31 on monday thoughts turned to @entity10 , even though he remained among the substitutes			1
he might be the one			0
@entity34 needed to find goals against @entity31 , having trailed for much of the game , but in the long - term he needs control			2
in the @entity40 studio , @entity38 implored the manager to bring back the 33 - year - old midfielder , who has been out since ankle surgery in the summer , in time to face @entity44 on sunday and @entity45 , a week later			1
in may , @entity10 was omitted from @entity48 ’s @entity47 squad after a campaign when he could be found toiling away at the heart of @entity13 ’s disarray as they slipped out of the @entity53 and @entity54 lost his job			1
@entity10 has been a key player for @entity13 over the past few seasons and won his @entity48 place back @entity58 – advised by coaching assistants @entity60 and @entity38 – decided there was no place for @entity10 in @entity63 , preferring @entity64 and @entity65 as his experienced central midfielders			1
@entity10 , despite a general consensus that he has got better with age , has not won an @entity48 cap since starting in the final @entity47 qualifier against @entity72 , a 2 - 0 win at @entity74 just over a year ago			1
however , @entity64 and @entity65 have retired from international football and @entity58 has reshaped his team to deploy a midfielder diamond , which has offered encouragement as it accommodates two strikers and a creator like @entity81			0
@entity10 thrives in his role as a holding midfielder for @entity13 what he is missing is a natural holding midfielder			1
not necessarily a ball - winner but a deep play - maker who can pass long or short with both feet and dictate the tempo ; someone with positional sense and the ability to read the rhythms of a game , preferably with physical presence and a little defensive instinct			2
@entity98 has coped well , but it is a role perfect for @entity10			2
after a 13 - year international career of 31 caps , one retirement and one come - back , @entity48 are playing with a system suited to his strengths , while @entity65 and @entity64 have quit			2
@entity10 could work perfectly in @entity58 's new system whether @entity58 will - or even should - return to @entity10 is debateable			0
@entity48 are building a team for the future			0
his return would only deny @entity98 more experience in a role he is learning but if @entity58 is unsure about @entity98 the anchorman – as @entity113 is – then he can recall the @entity13 midfielder as he develops an alternative			0
at @entity13 , there is no debate			0
@entity34 will restore @entity10 to the starting line - up , as soon as his fitness levels allow , either to anchor the midfield on his own in a diamond , releasing @entity123 to fulfil other duties , perhaps at left - back , or alongside @entity123 in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation for these two tough fixtures against @entity44 and @entity45 .			1

@entity13 drew 2 - 2 with @entity31 on monday night
@entity10 returned to the bench for @entity13 against @entity31
@entity10 has not played since *undergoing* ankle surgery in the summer
@entity10 could still play a role for @entity48 in a deep - lying midfield role
