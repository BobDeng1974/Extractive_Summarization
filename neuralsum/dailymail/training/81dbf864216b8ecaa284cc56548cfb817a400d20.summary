@entity0 must have been looking for @entity2 ’s ‘ @entity3 ’ t - shirt on thursday night			0
life could hardly get any worse for @entity5 in the @entity6			1
for the third successive season they were handed a ‘ @entity9 ’			2
there ’s no sugar - coating it — @entity13 is gruesome , brutal , grim			0
if @entity0 was to pick one scenario he did n’t want ahead of the draw , this would n’t have been far off			2
for the second successive season , @entity5 will face @entity20 ; the @entity35 giants wounded by last season ’s failed attempt to retain their title			1
riding on the crest of @entity44 ’s @entity43 win , @entity40 ’s side will be one of the toughest teams to beat this season			1
@entity5 ’s nightmare does not end there , though			2
two clashes against a rejuvenated @entity50 will provide a huge test of their @entity53 credentials			2
in an uncanny twist , @entity50 and @entity5 crossing paths throws open the possibility of @entity57 and @entity58 going head - to - head for the first time since they left @entity30 this summer			1
@entity0 will know the fixtures against @entity50 and @entity63 are paramount to @entity5 making it to the last 16			1
quick return : the draw gives @entity58 a first chance to return to @entity68 when @entity50 meet city tricky tie : @entity50 are a much better side than in previous years , led by a resurgent @entity72 and if he thought things could not get much worse , he only needs to look at a daunting eight - day stretch next month when he must squeeze a trip to @entity77 between crucial @entity6 clashes at @entity79 and at home to @entity30			1
‘ it ’s a tough one , ’ said @entity5 ’s sporting director @entity81			1
‘ our challenge is to be first in the group because that gives you an advantage			2
‘ the objective is higher now			0
that ’s why we improved the team , to give us a chance of winning the domestic competitions but also to be better in @entity92			0
there are five , six , eight other clubs that can win it but we can as well			0
why should we not set out to win the @entity6 ? ’ thursday ’s draw would also not have made comfortable viewing for @entity79 manager @entity98			1
perhaps not quite to the same extent as @entity0 , but @entity98 will yet again have to pit his wits against one of @entity92 ’s most impressive young coaches in @entity103			0
re-match : @entity105 , now departed from @entity106 , scored twice at the @entity107 last season achievable : @entity79 hit back in @entity44 and managed to get out of their group in second place last year but facing @entity106 , 2013 ’s beaten finalists , will not paralyse @entity98 ’s expensively - assembled squad with fear			1
after losing to the @entity35 side on matchday three last season , the @entity115 went to @entity106 and recorded a famous 1 - 0 win against the odds , @entity120 scoring			0
@entity79 secretary @entity121 said : ‘ it ’s tough but it ’s one from which there ’s a pre-requisite to finish first and avoid the likes of @entity128 at the start of the knock - out stage			1
’ @entity131 and @entity132 are likely provide a more modest test			0
while @entity134 ponder the challenge of @entity136 , @entity137 and the @entity138 of @entity139 , @entity26 must have had by far the best night ’s sleep			0
special one : @entity26 will be very please with @entity30 's comfortable @entity6 draw when he holds his weekly press conference at @entity30 ’s @entity145 on friday , the @entity143 will inevitably dispel the notion that his side have been handed an easy @entity53 ride			1
but the @entity149 himself could not have handpicked a more comfortable group			2
with all due respect , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 hardly reads as a who ’s who of @entity53 football ’s elite			0
much to @entity160 , @entity0 and @entity98 ’s annoyance , no doubt			0
video three @entity53 giants drawn in @entity164			0

city face @entity44 giants @entity20 for a third time in four years
@entity79 also handed tough draw but @entity30 given easy ride
@entity58 and @entity57 could have a *surprise* *re-union* as @entity5 are also matched with @entity50
despite difficult draw @entity81 says the aim is to top the group
