criticism : @entity0 has been attacked online after he speculated whether @entity2 was a ' victim ' opinion : mr @entity0 appeared on @entity10 on saturday and said : ' it 's become a circus , and i 'm just saying from everything i 've readsometimes you 're actually thinking , is he ( @entity2 ) a victim ? ' ' there 's no argument that the @entity26 need to come out with guidelines			1
they have been conspicuous by their absence			0
there should be something set down - you ca n't go anywhere near people like @entity2 until everything has been resolved			2
' @entity2 was on the brink of returning to professional football with @entity4 last week			2
but on the eve of the deal being signed the @entity39 club pulled out blaming ' enormous pressure from sponsors and threats to staff and their families '			0
an unnamed director at the club was allegedly told his own daughter would be raped if the @entity49 was allowed to play			0
more than 70,000 people signed a petition opposing the @entity4 deal but there has been a trickle of support for the disgraced former wales and @entity58 striker			2
@entity61 managers @entity59 and @entity62 both said he should be allowed to return to football			0
and at @entity4 's match with @entity66 on saturday there were some chants of ' one @entity2 ' and ' sign him up ' , and one banner read : ' 70,000 where are you ? '			1
the @entity1 has responded to criticism of mr @entity0			1
@entity72 : @entity4 was very close to signing @entity2 but pulled out at the last minute a spokesman said : ' @entity0 was contributing to a wider discussion in which he was highlighting the media frenzy this week			1
in no way was he claiming @entity2 was the victim , which is apparent in the full context of the conversation			2
' the footballer himself spoke out after the deal collapsed blamed ‘ mob rule ’ for scuppering the deal , and claimed his silence had been ‘ misinterpreted as arrogance ’			0
and he did finally apologise to ‘ the woman concerned ’ – but continued to maintain his innocence			0
yesterday it emerged that @entity2 could face a further 14 months out of football if he continues his fight to clear his name			1
former @entity58 player @entity2 has been shunned by several football clubs since he left prison after two - and - a - half years following his conviction for the rape of a 19 - year - old woman			0
now it appears his best hope of returning to the game appears to be having his conviction overturned			0
this could take more than a year to get to the @entity104 and will mean @entity2 will not have played a professional game for four years			0
because he is still on licence @entity2 is also barred from leaving @entity107 for extended periods , which has led him to put his wedding plans on hold .			2
