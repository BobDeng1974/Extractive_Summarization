by @entity1 reporter published : 02:39 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 04:30 est , 2 july 2012 a cup of coffee a day can help keep skin cancer at bay , according to a new study			0
researchers found increasing the number of cups of caffeinated coffee you drink could lower your risk of developing the most common form of skin cancer , basal cell carcinoma			1
doctor @entity17 , associate professor at @entity18 in the @entity19 , said : ' our data indicate that the more caffeinated coffee you consume , the lower your risk of developing basal cell carcinoma			1
study suggests caffeine in coffee decreases risk of basal cell carcinoma ' i would not recommend increasing your coffee intake based on these data alone			1
' however , our results add basal cell carcinoma to a list of conditions for which risk is decreased with increasing coffee consumption			1
this list includes conditions with serious negative health consequences such as type 2 diabetes and parkinson 's disease			0
' even though basal cell carcinoma is slow - growing , it causes considerable illness and places a burden on health care systems			1
there are an estimated 80,000 new cases in the @entity46 every year			1
dr @entity17 said : ' given the large number of newly diagnosed cases , daily dietary changes having any protective effect may have an impact on public health			0
' dr @entity17 and his colleagues analysed data from the @entity55 , a large and long - running study to aid in the investigation of factors influencing women 's health , and the @entity60 , a study of men			0
of the 112,897 participants included in the analyses , 22,786 developed basal cell carcinoma during the more than 20 years of the two studies			1
an inverse association was observed between all coffee consumption and risk of basal cell carcinoma			1
similarly , an inverse association was seen between intake of caffeine from all dietary sources - coffee , tea , cola and chocolate - and risk of basal cell carcinoma			2
however , consumption of decaffeinated coffee was not associated with a decreased risk of basal cell carcinoma			2
dr @entity17 said : ' these results really suggest that it is the caffeine in coffee that is responsible for the decreased risk of basal cell carcinoma associated with increasing coffee consumption			2
' this would be consistent with published mouse data , which indicate caffeine can block skin tumour formation			0
' however , more studies in different population cohorts and additional mechanistic studies will be needed before we can say this definitively			0
' in contrast to the findings for basal cell carcinoma , neither coffee consumption nor caffeine intake were inversely associated with the two other forms of skin cancer , squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma , the most deadly form of the disease			1
only 1,953 cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 741 cases of melanoma were recorded among the 112,897 participants included in @entity17 's analyses			2
dr @entity17 added : ' it is possible that these numbers are insufficient for any association with coffee consumption to be seen			0
' as the study participants are followed for a longer time , the number of cases of these conditions is likely to increase			0
we may be in a position in 10 years ' time to better address this issue			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity121 .			0

there are an estimated 80,000 new cases of basal cell carcinoma in @entity46 every year
*outlook* is *generally* good as the cancer *spreads* to other parts of the body in just *0.5* *%* cases
