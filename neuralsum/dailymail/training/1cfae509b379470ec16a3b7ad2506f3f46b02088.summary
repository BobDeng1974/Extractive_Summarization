by @entity0 published : 13:33 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 13:42 est , 5 january 2013 a bluefin tuna sold for a record £ 1.09million at a @entity3 auction today , nearly three times the previous high set last year			1
the fish 's tender pink and red meat is prized for sushi and sashimi - and the best slices , known as ' o - toro ' , can sell for £ 14 ( 2,000 yen ) per piece at upmarket @entity14 sushi bars			1
caught off the country 's northeastern coast , the 222kg ( 489lb ) tuna was sold at the first auction of the year at @entity3 's sprawling @entity20 fish market , said market official @entity21			1
that means the price for this year 's whopper works out at a stunning £ 2,230 per pound			1
@entity14 eat 80 per cent of the bluefin tuna caught worldwide , and much the global catch is shipped there for consumption			1
the winning bidder , @entity28 , president of @entity30 , which operates the @entity32 restaurant chain , said ' the price was a bit high ' but that he wanted to ' encourage @entity46 ' , according to @entity47			2
the massive catch is being served to his customers this evening			2
@entity28 also set the old record of £ 430,000 for a bluefin tuna at last year 's @entity53 's auction , which tends to attract high bids as a celebratory way to kick off the new year - or get some publicity			1
but the high prices do n't necessarily reflect exceptionally high fish quality			1
stocks of all three bluefin species - the @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 - have fallen over the past 15 years amid overfishing			2
the price for this year 's whopper works out at a stunning £ 2,230 per pound - but the high price does n't necessarily reflect exceptionally high fish quality stocks of all three bluefin species - the @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 - have fallen over the past 15 years amid overfishing the bluefin tuna is one of the largest and fastest fish in the world			1
on average , it measures 6.5ft in length and weighs 550lb , although much larger specimens are not uncommon			2
its torpedo - shaped , streamlined body is built for speed and endurance			2
in appearance , they are metallic blue on top and silver - white on the bottom which helps camouflage them from above and below			0
@entity85 meat is considered a delicacy and overfishing has driven their numbers to critically low levels			0
it has been eaten by humans for centuries and today the @entity14 eat 80 per cent of the @entity61 and @entity59 bluefins caught			0
on monday , an intergovernmental group is to release data on @entity98 stocks that environmentalists believe will likely show an alarming decline			0
' everything we 're hearing is that there 's no good news for the @entity98 , ' said @entity105 , director of the @entity108 - based @entity107 's global tuna conservation campaign			1
' we 're seeing a very high value fish continue to be overfished			1
' the population of another species , the @entity110 , which swims in the @entity59 , has plunged to 3 to 8 per cent of its original levels			0
stocks of bluefin caught in the @entity61 and @entity116 plunged by 60 per cent between 1997 and 2007 due to rampant , often illegal , overfishing and lax quotas			0
although there has been some improvement in recent years , experts say the outlook for the species is still fragile			0
in november , the 48 member nations of the @entity124 , or @entity124 , voted to maintain strict catch limits on the species , although some countries argued for higher limits			0
the quota will be allowed to rise slightly from 12,900 metric tons a year to 13,500			0
the fish 's tender pink and red meat is prized for sushi and sashimi - and the best slices , known as ' o - toro ' , can sell for £ 14 ( 2,000 yen ) per piece at upmarket @entity14 sushi bars quotas were as high as 32,000 tons in 2006			1
a total catch limit on the @entity98 has been imposed only recently in the eastern part of the @entity59 near the @entity141 and @entity142 , but not by the intergovernmental group that oversees the western @entity59 , @entity105 said			0
so - called effort limits in place now - restrictions on the number of vessels and days fishing allowed - are not effective , she added , and fisherman also are targeting juvenile populations and spawning grounds			0
' this poor species is being hit from every angle , ' she said			0
