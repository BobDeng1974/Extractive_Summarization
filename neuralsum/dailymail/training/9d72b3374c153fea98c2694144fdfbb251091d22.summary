by @entity0 resignation : @entity4 has been forced to step down after @entity3 's @entity2 found her guilty of abuse of power @entity3 's prime minister has been forced to resign after the @entity2 found her guilty of abusing her power , pushing the country deeper into political turmoil			1
prime minister @entity4 , 46 , was charged with abusing her authority by transferring a senior civil servant to another position in 2011			1
the court ruled that the transfer was carried out with a ' hidden agenda ' to benefit her politically powerful family and , therefore , violated the constitution , an accusation she has denied			1
' transferring government officials must be done in accordance with moral principle , ' the court said in its ruling			0
' transferring with a hidden agenda is not acceptable			1
' it is not immediately clear who will become the new acting prime minister			0
the ruling also forced out nine @entity32 members who the court said were complicit in the transfer of @entity35 from national security council chief to a role in @entity4 's office			1
the verdict marks the latest dramatic twist in @entity3 's long - running political crisis			2
it is a victory for @entity4 's opponents who for the past six months have been engaged in violent street protests demanding she step down to make way for an interim unelected leader			2
but it does little to resolve @entity3 's political crisis as it leaves the country in limbo - and primed for more clashes			2
since november , more than 20 have been killed and hundreds injured in demonstrations			1
the ruling also casts doubt on whether new elections planned for july will take place , which would anger @entity4 's mostly rural supporters who have called for a major rally in @entity60 on saturday			0
reaction : anti-government supporters celebrate after hearing the news that prime minister @entity64 was forced to step down following a court ruling coverage : the judge , sitting in @entity60 , read out the verdict live on television it also remains far from clear whether her opponents will be able to achieve other key demands , including creating a reform council overseen by a leader of their choice who will carry out various steps to rid the country of corruption and what they say is money politics , including alleged vote - buying			1
the campaign against @entity4 has been the latest chapter in @entity3 's political upheaval that began when her brother , @entity87 , was ousted by a 2006 military coup			2
it came after protestors accused him of corruption , abuse of power and disrespect for the constitutional monarch @entity95			0
controversial : she was charged with abusing her authority in 2011 when she moved a civil servant to another position			1
her supporters claim she has been the target of a ' judicial coup ' raising a glass : protestors , who have been filling the streets and calling for @entity4 to be ousted for the last six months , toast their ' victory ' the @entity2 in 2007 made a landmark ruling dissolving @entity87 's original @entity107 for fraud in a 2006 election , and banned its executives from politics for five years			0
@entity87 went into self - imposed exile in 2008 to escape a two - year jail sentence for conflict of interest while prime minister			0
@entity87 's allies in late 2007 handily won the first post-coup election , but the @entity2 in 2008 kicked out two successive @entity120 prime ministers			0
a coalition government then cobbled together by the opposition @entity122 had to use the army to put down @entity120 demonstrations in 2010 that left more than 90 people dead in street battles , but @entity4 and her @entity128 won a sweeping majority in a mid- 2011 general election			0
@entity4 's fortunes plunged when her party 's lawmakers last year used shady legislative tactics to try to ram through a law that would have given an amnesty to political offenders of the previous eight years , including @entity87 .			0
