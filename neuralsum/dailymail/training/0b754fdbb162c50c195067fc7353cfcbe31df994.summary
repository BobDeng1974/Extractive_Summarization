prince @entity0 said he is alarmed at the number of young @entity4 radicalised online prince @entity0 says it is a ' great worry ' that so many young @entity4 who are yearning for adventure and excitement are being radicalised by ' crazy stuff ' online			1
the heir to the throne partly blamed the growing number of @entity13 fanatics in the @entity4 on a desire to ' want to take risks ' but added that the most ' frightening part ' was the role of the internet			1
his comments , in which he also urged young jihadists to show more respect to ' the values we hold dear ' , were broadcast in an interview with @entity26 's @entity25 , at the start of his six - day tour of the @entity29			1
he said : ' the radicalisation of people in @entity4 is a great worry , and the extent to which this is happening is alarming , particularly in a country like ours where we hold values dear			1
' you would think the people who have come here , or are born here , and go to school here , would abide by those values and outlooks			0
' he added : ' but the frightening part is that people can be so radicalised , either through direct contact with somebody , or through the internet			0
' there is an extraordinary amount of crazy stuff on the internet and clearly some people get particularly affected by it and join with others			1
' i can see some of this radicalisation is a search for adventure and excitement at a particular age			1
' the prince added that he had been working with the @entity62 and other groups to try and find alternatives for those who are prone to radicalisation			0
he said he had been working in deprived , @entity68 areas of the @entity4 and had found ' interesting examples ' of people who have been deradicalised after being ' horrified ' by what they have learned			1
the prince also touched on the difficulty of preventing radicalisation , saying you can not ' just sweep it under the carpet ' , but instead have to remind people of ' the distortions that are made of great religions '			2
he said : ' how you prevent radicalisation in the first place is the great challenge			2
you can not just sweep it under the carpet			0
but the most important thing is to remind people of the distortions that are made of great religions , and the original ideas of the founders of these religions			2
' often you find their message is so distorted by their putative followers			0
that 's the tragedy and , of course , traditional @entity13 does not permit this sort of thing			2
' during the interview , he also launched a staunch defence of the ' christian standpoint ' , killing off speculation that he will take up the multicultural ' defender of the faith title ' when he becomes king			0
experts believe there are now thousands of young @entity4 fighting for the @entity112 in @entity113 and @entity114 , the majority of whom are said to have been radicalised online			1
