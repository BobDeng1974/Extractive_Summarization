the glacier named after @entity3 explorer @entity1 in @entity4 a stash of 80 - year - old photo plates in a @entity3 basement has proved that @entity4 's ice was melting even faster then that it is now			1
in the thirties , @entity4 's ice was melting rapidly , then there was a cooling period in the middle part of the twentieth century , and now it is melting again , accelerating in the 2000s			1
images of ice shelves from the pre-satellite era are extremely rare , so it 's often difficult to assess the scale and speed of @entity22 ice melting today			1
researchers at the @entity24 had been storing the glass plates since explorer @entity1 's expedition to the southeast coast of @entity4 in the early 1930s			1
in this week 's online edition of @entity33 , @entity30 researchers and colleagues in @entity3 describe how they analyzed ice loss in the region by comparing the images on the plates to aerial photographs and satellite images taken from @entity40 to today			1
taken together , the imagery shows that glaciers in the region were melting even faster in the 1930s than they are today , said @entity44 , associate professor of geography and researcher at the @entity47 at @entity30			2
a brief cooling period starting in the mid- 20th century allowed new ice to form , and then the melting began to accelerate again in the 2000s			1
‘ because of this study , we now have a detailed historical analogue for more recent glacier loss , ’ @entity52 said			0
‘ and we 've confirmed that glaciers are very sensitive indicators of climate			0
’ pre-satellite observations of @entity4 glaciers are rare - but some are available			1
images recorded in 1933 ( left ) and 2010 from a glacier northeast of @entity64 : during the 77 year period the glacier has retreated 1.7km @entity66 , doctoral fellow at the @entity67 of @entity3 and lead author of the study , is trying to compile all such imagery			1
he found a clue in the archives of @entity73 in @entity74 in 2011			0
‘ we found flight journals for some old planes , and in them was a reference to @entity24 , ’ @entity66 said			0
a stash of 80 - year - old photo plates in a @entity3 basement has proved that @entity4 's ice was melting even faster then that it is now @entity1 , the @entity3 polar explorer whose photo archive contained the shock news about @entity22 ice melt as it happens , researchers at the @entity24 had already contacted @entity66 about a find of their own			1
‘ they were cleaning up in the basement and had found some old glass plates with glaciers on them			2
the reason the plates were forgotten was that they were recorded for mapping , and once the map was produced they did n't have much value			0
’ those plates turned out to be documentation of @entity1 's 7th @entity1 to @entity4			1
they contained aerial photographs of land , sea and glaciers in the southeast region of the country , along with travel photos of @entity1 's team			2
the researchers digitized all the old images and used software to look for differences in the shape of the southeast @entity4 coastline where the ice meets the @entity119			1
then they calculated the distance the ice front moved in each time period			0
the @entity124 hydroplane after returning from a surveying mission during @entity1 ¿ s expedition to @entity4 in the 1930s over the 80 years , two events stand out : glacial retreats from 1933 - 1934 and 2000 - 2010			1
in the 1930s , fewer glaciers were melting than are today , and most of those that were melting were land - terminating glaciers , meaning that they did not contact the sea			2
those that were melting retreated an average of 20 meters per year - the fastest retreating at 374 meters per year			1
fifty - five percent of the glaciers in the study had similar or higher retreat rates during the 1930s than they do today			2
still , more glaciers in southeast @entity4 are retreating today , and the average ice loss is 50 meters per year			1
that 's because a few glaciers with very fast melting rates - including one retreating at 887 meters per year - boost the overall average			1
but to @entity52 , the most interesting part of the study is what happened between the two melting events			0
from 1943 - 1972 , southeast @entity4 cooled - probably due to sulfur pollution , which reflects sunlight away from the earth			2
sulfur dioxide is a poisonous gas produced by volcanoes and industrial processes			0
it has been tied to serious health problems and death , and is also the main ingredient in acid rain			0
its presence in the atmosphere peaked just after the @entity168 was established in 1963			0
as it was removed from the atmosphere , the earlier warming resumed			0
the important point is not that deadly pollution caused the climate to cool , but rather that the brief cooling allowed researchers to see how @entity4 ice responded to the changing climate			1
the glaciers responded to the cooling more rapidly than researchers had seen in earlier studies			0
sixty percent of the glaciers advanced during that time , while 12 percent were stationary			0
and now that the warming has resumed , the glacial retreat is dominated by marine - terminating outlet glaciers , the melting of which contributes to sea level rise			0
‘ from these images , we see that the mid-century cooling stabilized the glaciers , ’ @entity52 said			2
‘ that suggests that if we want to stabilize today 's accelerating ice loss , we need to see a little cooling of our own			2
’ @entity4 is a good place to study the effects of climate change , he explained , because the region is closely tied to air and water circulation patterns in the @entity119			0
‘ by far , more storms pass through this region - transporting heat into the @entity22 - than anywhere else in the @entity205			0
climate change brings changes in snowfall and air temperature that compete for influence on a glacier 's net behavior , ’ he said .			0
