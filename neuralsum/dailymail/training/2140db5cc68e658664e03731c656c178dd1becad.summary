by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 18:06 est , 26 november 2012 president @entity1 is cast in a negative light in the upcoming movie about the @entity5 raid as it opens with 15 graphic minutes of a terror suspect being waterboarded			1
moments later , the screen flashes to a news interview of the then - president elect talking about how he does not believe in torture			2
conservatives were quick to criticize the film @entity13 , preemptively proclaiming that it would prove to be a campaign tool for president @entity1 , but now select critics have actually seen the film , political pundits may be forced to eat their words			1
another criticism of the film was that director @entity21 and screenwriter @entity22 ( both of @entity24 fame ) received special treatment by the @entity1 administration during the production stages of the film , but both have denied such claims			1
' it was all based on first hands accounts so it really felt very vivid and very vital and very , very immediate and visceral of course which is very exciting as a film maker , ' @entity21 said without revealing any specific sources			1
poster : the film ' @entity13 , ' which details the hunt for @entity5 is non-political at one point , an agent tells a captured @entity61 leader that he should just give up early in the ‘ interrogation ’ process because it would just be easier			2
‘ in the end , bro , everybody breaks			0
it ’s biology , ’ the agent named @entity69 , played by actor @entity70 , tells a terror suspect			2
while the public will have to wait to evaluate the torture scenes until the film is released - which will take place in select markets on december 19 but not until january 11 nationwide - @entity79 ’s @entity78 say that the @entity82 operative ’s methods include the use waterboarding , a dog collar , heavy metal soundtracks on full blast throughout the day , and food deprivation			1
‘ once you see it , you ’ll be writing to your congressman to prevent it from happening again , ’ @entity89 critic @entity88 says of the waterboarding of a suspected terrorist			0
it is in the context of the waterboarding debate where president @entity1 makes his sole appearance in the film , as the screen flashes to a real 2008 news clip where he says that he does n’t believe in torture			1
though it is unclear which news clip is used in the film , there are plenty to choose from			1
one of the clearest examples is a sit - down interview that the then - president - elect had with 60 minutes just days after he won the presidency in november of 2008			0
during the lengthy interview , @entity1 asserts : ' i have said repeatedly that @entity116 does n't torture and i 'm going to make sure we do n't torture			1
' possibility : in @entity13 , a news clip from 2008 shows then - president - elect @entity1 talking about his stance against torture			1
he said so repeatedly , including during the pictured interview with 60 minutes though the film claims to avoid the partisan nature of the debate on what torture should be condoned to allow for the retrieval of critical information , the juxtaposition of @entity1 's statement against torture next to 15 gritty minutes of a waterboarding scene shows a clear disconnect between what what was being said on the issue and what was actually happening			1
he stood by this belief as he transitioned into office , and one of the first executive orders that he signed banning torture techniques - even explicitly citing waterboarding as one that was outlawed - during his first week in office			2
the framing of the president ’s stance in the film comes as a bit of a surprise to many , since he and his administration reportedly allowed the filmmakers - director @entity21 and writer @entity22 - access to a number of classified information			1
once news broke of the administration ’s willingness to work with the @entity155 heavyweights - @entity21 won the @entity159 and @entity160 for their work on @entity24 - @entity162 cried afoul			1
congressman @entity163 , the @entity162 head of the @entity164 , called for an investigation into whether or not the filmmakers were given confidential information during the making of the blockbuster			0
chilling : in the film @entity116 agents ( like the one portrayed by this actor in the film 's trailer ) are shown torturing suspects by blasting metal music , depriving them water and sleep , and waterboarding them adding to the expected outcry , @entity179 reports that there was one @entity21 who donated $ 200 to the @entity1 campaign in 2011 - right when she would have been working on the film - though she has not publicly supported any political candidates in the past			1
waterboarding is a controversial torture tactic that has been used been used by the @entity82 in their interrogation of terror suspects			1
the specifics of the tactics differ , but in most cases a cloth or plastic wrap is put over the suspect 's face and then the agent proceeds to tour water on their head			0
it is thought to simulate drowning , and the bound suspect fears that their are about to die			0
the official stance on it 's use has varied over the years , though the @entity82 has publicly confirmed that they have used the technique on at least three @entity61 operatives , including self - proclaimed ' 9/11 mastermind ' @entity209			2
in an interview with @entity212 's @entity211 , @entity21 and @entity22 said that they never asked any politicians for any top - secret information			1
' i certainly did a lot of homework , but i never asked for classified material			2
to my knowledge i never received any , ' @entity22 said , as he was the one to research and write the screenplay			0
' i picked up the phone and started calling sources and asking them what they knew and taking referrals and knocking on doors and really approached it as comprehensively as i could , ' he told @entity211			0
' ( the @entity82 agents ) were proud of what they had done , but they had more or less resigned themselves to the fact that what they had done is not something they could talk about publicly			1
' but one of the things a movie allows people to do is talk in a way that is a little bit freer because they know that movies can change the way people look , [ and ] that i do n't have quite the same standards of having to reveal sources as i would if i was , let 's say , running a front page piece in the @entity246			0
' @entity163 ’s knee jerk reaction against @entity1 administration involvement may have been too soon , however , as the full extent of the film ’s depiction of torture was not fully realized until a critic ’s screening took place over the weekend			1
hints of the inclusion of torture came in the second version of the trailer , which opens with the voice of an agent presumably warning a detainee			0
‘ can i be honest with you ? i am bad news			0
i 'm not your friend , i 'm not going to help you , i 'm going to break you , ’ the @entity116 actor says			0
@entity82 : the film focuses on , @entity45 , the ' wicked smart ' female @entity82 agent played by actress @entity42 who was obsessed with catching and killing @entity5 , pictured women of the film : @entity44 plays the lead character ( left ) and said that she knew the film would be politically controversial , while director @entity21 ( right ) said that the torture scenes were the hardest to film in another clip , the film ’s lead , actress @entity42 who plays the intense @entity82 agent @entity45 , is seen watching footage of an interrogation where the suspect has a cloth covering his head as his hands are bound behind the chair			1
according to the @entity79 review , @entity45 sits quietly as @entity69 tortures the suspect named @entity286			0
at one point , @entity286 turns to @entity45 pleading ' your friend is an animal			0
please help me , ' but she allows it to continue			0
according to the critics , the film ’s focus on the decade - long hunt for the terrorist mastermind takes the attention away from the partisan politics and onto the true facts of what took place in the years , and eventually , final days leading up to the killing			2
operation : @entity5 's body was identified and buried out to sea after the raid , pictured as portrayed in the film ‘ i knew the second i read the script and i was learning things , i knew that it was going to be a hot - button issue , ’ @entity44 previously told the wrap			0
‘ even when we were shooting , there was great care to be as respectful to the story as possible			0
for me , that was the most important thing : that we tell the right story for history ’s sake			0
’ for the director , that meant the jarring waterboarding scenes , which she said were the most difficult to film			2
‘ i wish that it was n't a part of history , but it is and was , ’ she said			0
