that period between the summer and the end of november gave me thinking time			2
there ’s no blame and i ’m not angry about it			0

‘ i never wanted to find myself in the situation where i was coming back to play against @entity4			2
even if i went somewhere else in @entity64 i ’d be running that risk in terms of the @entity143 competitions			0
‘ also , i said to myself that if you want to play for a big team in @entity64 with a great coach then i may as well stay put as i had all that here already			2
‘ that would n’t have been the change i was looking for			0
the attraction of @entity48 was a different lifestyle , a different culture for myself and my family			0
’ @entity54 striker @entity154 believes @entity4 will struggle without @entity1 @entity1 was @entity4 ’s star in their @entity56 win over @entity54 on monday			1
the man who tormented @entity1 ’s defensive team - mates that night , @entity154 , believes they will miss their captain			1
‘ to lose him , boy , i do n’t know the future , but it will be a problem , ’ said @entity154 , who rattled his beloved @entity10 with an equaliser before @entity1 ’s winner			2
‘ you can see he was the difference			0
if he did n’t play , it would have been a different story			0
he was miles better than anybody on the pitch			0
‘ sometimes when you play against people you can just use the word “ class ”			0
that ’s what it is			0
two moments of magic won the game			0
‘ he is the difference and @entity4 will lose that			2
i do n’t want to see him go			0
not just as a @entity4 supporter but as a lover of football			2

if he needs to go to pastures new , so be it			0
all you can do is wish him on his merry way and hope he comes back as manager one day			0
