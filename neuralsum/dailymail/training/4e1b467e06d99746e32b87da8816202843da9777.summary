by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 15 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:01 est , 15 february 2014 against the odds : @entity5 's cerebral palsy , has not stopped him from pursuing an acting career as the stars of tonight ’s controversial and much talked - about episode of @entity9 – watched by about nine million viewers each week – actors @entity5 and @entity12 are unarguably hot property			1
they play a young couple , @entity14 and @entity15 , who are both ‘ patients ’ in a home for the disabled – forced apart , and mocked when she becomes pregnant			1
@entity14 ’s parents are disgusted to discover she is expecting @entity15 ’s child , branding it unnatural and preventing him from seeing her again			1
the desperately sad scenario was a routine way of handling the situation in the 1950s			1
campaigners have welcomed the storyline , saying it showed how far we have come as a society in accepting diversity			1
yet the actors – who have the same disabilities as their on - screen personas , @entity34 with @entity36 ’s syndrome and @entity5 with cerebral palsy – believe there ’s still a long way to go			1
@entity5 , 27 , was once told a career in showbusiness would be little more than a pipedream			1
‘ they said no one would want to watch a disabled person on tv , ’ he reveals – declining to name the culprit			1
‘ so call the midwife is a big “ i can do it even if you think i ca n’t ”			1
’ @entity34 , 25 , adds : ‘ although i thank @entity50 i was n’t born at that time , and i got very angry when reading the script about people being put in institutions , some of those attitudes are still around			1
’ both welcome anything that gets people talking about equality , and accepting that disabled people have romantic relationships			1
‘ we ’re all different and all part of society			1
we have a right to fall in love , ’ adds @entity34			1
@entity5 says : ‘ it was very courageous of @entity9 to bring to the forefront such an unspoken about topic as people with disabilities having relationships			1
' @entity15 is a young guy wanting a family and being in love rather than just a person with a disability who has to be cared for			1
’ on - screen love : @entity15 , played by @entity5 , and @entity14 , played by @entity12 , are forced apart when @entity14 falls pregnant but even 60 years after the drama is set , portrayals of sex and love among people with disabilities are so rare it provokes strong feelings – something that baffles @entity5			1
‘ my brother and his partner are both disabled and i went to a school for disabled people so i grew up seeing disabled people fall in love , ’ he says			2
‘ but relationships among disabled people are still taboo , although with shows like @entity94 [ @entity95 ’s programme about people with disabilities dating ] able - bodied people are becoming intrigued			2
’ @entity5 was diagnosed with cerebral palsy aged two after a traumatic birth in which he was strangled by the umbilical cord			1
starved of oxygen , he suffered brain damage that led to his condition – which affects the way the brain communicates with the muscles , causing stiffness and problems with movement			2
he was n’t expected to survive , but surpassed doctors ’ expectations and learnt to walk and talk			2
today , as we sit in a pub in @entity114 , he speaks more slowly and quietly than most – and also with more effort , as cerebral palsy can affect the vocal cords – but this does n’t dampen his vociferousness			1
@entity5 is working on a phd as well as appearing in the hit @entity122 show			1
and like his character , he ’s looking for love and wanting a family			2
‘ apart from one or two able - bodied people , i ’ve mostly dated disabled people , ’ he says , pointing out this is partly because of his environment			2
his first girlfriend , for example , went to the same sixth - form boarding college for disabled pupils as he did			2
but there are advantages to being with another disabled person			2
‘ you have a mutual understanding of what it ’s like having an impairment so you do n’t need to explain , ’ he says			2
‘ but that can also make you think you have more in common than you do			2
so there are pros and cos			2
i just try to see the person as an individual , not according to what their disability is			2
it ’s about a similar outlook and whether we can connect on an emotional level			0
’ but a 2008 poll by @entity155 found 70 per cent of able - bodied people would n’t date someone with a physical disability			0
love story : @entity5 as @entity15 and @entity160 as @entity161 in sunday 's controversial episode of @entity9 ‘ they ’re writing off a tenth of the population , ’ says @entity5			1
his longest relationship has been 18 months , and the dating game for someone who has a personal assistant to help him dress , cook and eat has practical challenges			0
‘ it ’s been hard , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’m not going to lie			0
’ even making the first move has its obstacles			0
‘ having a disability , you ’re not sure how they ’re going to react and you mostly meet people in bars and clubs where it ’s harder because the music drowns out my speech			0
‘ also , buying someone a drink is tricky as i ca n’t carry a glass , ’ he says , sipping tea through a straw			0
online dating has proved fruitful , though , and he prefers to use generic sites rather than those for the disabled			0
‘ inclusion is the main principle disabled people – and society – should strive for			0
i always tell women before we meet [ about having cerebral palsy ] and normally the reaction is positive			1
they say , “ thanks for telling me , ” or they ’re intrigued			0
’ when dates do n’t progress beyond a first meeting , he is left wondering whether it ’s because of his cerebral palsy			1
‘ but you ca n’t exactly ask people – they would get defensive as everyone likes to portray themselves as open - minded			0
’ some women become maternal towards him			0
‘ i can sense condescension			0
and i also try to resist those who think i ’m somehow inspiring			0
yes , there have been barriers and i ’ve worked hard to break them down , but i would n’t call that anything other than fighting for what is rightfully achievable			0
’ mostly he is an old - fashioned romantic – although there can be pitfalls			0
‘ there have been barriers to having romantic nights alone as neither of us can pour a glass of wine or eat alone , but laughing it off helps			0
’ @entity5 would like to have children and is optimistic about finding love			1
he already has a role model : his big brother			0
‘ @entity230 , who ’s 29 , has arthritis and is in a civil partnership with a man who has cerebral palsy			1
they have a very happy , loving relationship despite discrimination on a few levels			0
i ’m very proud of them			0
’ although we ’ve witnessed a sea change in attitudes since the 1950s , @entity5 is deeply concerned about complacency settling in after the 2012 paralympics			1
‘ hearing people talk about how attractive the athletes were , like @entity247 , was the best thing – that was incredible			0
but the @entity249 has n’t had as big an impact as we would have hoped			0
we ca n’t just do a one - off blast to inclusion – then it fades way			0
we need to put the time , effort and resources into continuing that legacy			0
we need disabled people to be valued as contributors to our whole society			0
