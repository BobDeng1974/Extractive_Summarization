fantasist : academics have compiled over 700 of @entity3 's letters and photographs @entity3 - @entity6 chief and organiser of the holocaust of six million @entity9 - has been exposed as an insecure romantic fantasist who kept the secret of the mass @entity9 extermination programme he directed from his wife and mistress in case it upset them			1
academics in @entity21 have spent the last three years examining the letters , photos , memorandums - even a recipe book - of the most feared man in @entity21 after they were discovered in @entity27			1
@entity3 , who as @entity28 was in charge of the entire complex of concentration camps throughout @entity32 and oversaw the systematic murder of around six million @entity9 during the @entity34			1
but in the letters and diaries being serialised by @entity21 ’s @entity38 newspaper he comes across as a foppish , even diffident accomplice to mass slaughter			1
in all , the @entity6 commander sent some 700 letters to his wife , @entity43			1
many evoking the ' banality of evil ’ famously ascribed to his murderous @entity6 lieutenant @entity46 , who organised the transportation of @entity9 to gas chambers			2
on the eve of @entity51 , the invasion of the @entity52 in june 1941 , one of the letters @entity3 wrote to his wife @entity43 said : ' now it is war again			1
i knew it - i slept so badly			0
' collection : a trove of letters , notes and photos that were in possession of an @entity27 family			1
the letters are believed to be written by @entity6 leader @entity3 and had not been shown to the public @entity43 wrote back ; ' there is a box of caviar in the fridge			1
' twenty seven million @entity74 and millions more @entity76 soldiers were to die in the campaign that the @entity21 launched on june 22 that year			2
@entity3 , who was in charge of the entire complex of concentration camps throughout @entity32 , wrote to @entity43 on july 7 , 15 days after the invasion had begun , apologising for missing his wedding anniversary			2
' i am so sorry i missed our anniversary for the first time ' , he wrote four days after the event			0
' there was lots going on in these days			0
the fighting is very hard for the @entity6 ' not that @entity3 was anywhere near the frontline - the letter was sent from his holiday home in @entity94			1
historians have spent three years studying the archive , which belonged to a @entity9 man before it was sealed in a bank vault in @entity99 , in order to test its authenticity , before coming to the conclusion that it is genuine			0
in an editorial @entity38 writes : ' at first glance @entity3 ’s letters , especially his early ones , to his wife revolve around mundane things			1
' but they say much about the world of ideas and the self - image of an apparently unfeeling , self - righteous bureaucrat who became the pioneer and chief organizer of humanity ’s greatest crime - the @entity118			1
' @entity3 is seen here with his daughter , @entity120 @entity3 , who was in charge of the entire complex of concentration camps throughout @entity32 , is seen here inspecting a @entity74 prisoner of war the newspaper adds : ' there was ´ no word about the countless crimes in which he was involved as @entity130 , or that he had arranged			2
' not a word about the persecution , deprivation of rights and murder of approximately six million @entity136			0
and barely a word about the ghettos guarded by his ss and his police , and the death camps , which he also attended			0
family : @entity3 in @entity144 , @entity94 , with his wife @entity43 ( back right ) his daughter @entity120 ( front centre ) , his son @entity149 ( front right ) , and a friend of @entity120 ( front left ) '' i 'm going to @entity153			1
kisses , your @entity155 '			0
that was all what the closest advisor to @entity159 wrote			0
' the @entity3 correspondence was taken from his home at @entity163 on the shores of @entity165 in @entity94 in 1945 as he went on the run			2
he had taken the identity of a lowly serviceman , shaved off his moustache and went walking across @entity21 before he was caught by a @entity171 patrol in may 1945			2
he committed suicide with a phial of cyanide hidden in his mouth before he could be questioned			0
@entity3 met his future wife , @entity176 , seven years his senior , on a train in september 1927 where , according to @entity38 , he displayed his ' anti-semitism ' on a trip from @entity182 to @entity183			1
from @entity185 that year they were a partnership			0
later she would write to him : ' i am so happy to have a good bad man that loves his evil wife ! ' the academics who authenticated the correspondence for @entity38 said that he often referred to himself as a ' beast ' and a ' wild man ' in his letters to @entity43 that fuelled the sexual fantasies of them both			1
' my black soul thinks of only the most impossible things , ' she wrote to him in 1928			0
he refers to her often in the letters as ' beloved , golden woman , ' and describes himself as a ' good and wild @entity204 ' - a class of mercenary soldier in @entity21 in the 16th and 17th centuries			1
they traded insults about the @entity9 in letters before the war , and in one @entity43 wrote : ' the jew pack has much dread of you			0
' the jew remains the jew ! ' @entity3 wrote back to her on june 21 1928 ; ' do n’t get angry about the @entity9 , good woman , i can help you			2
' the previous year he wrote : ' i like @entity221 today because you are there , just like i would like the small poor village where you came from if you were still there			0
' as head of the @entity6 , @entity3 was one of the most feared men in @entity21			1
he was widely considered to be one of @entity159 's key henchman during the @entity34 the young couple shared not only common distaste for @entity9			0
also , the @entity231 capital @entity221 , where @entity43 managed small private sanatorium at the beginning of their relationship , not particularly good came away			0
' @entity221 is today like me because you live there , just like me the poor small village would love if it were your home ' , @entity3 wrote on christmas day 1927 at his girlfriend			2
' the system of @entity221 , that does not treat well a good and pure woman like you , i hate , and will always hate			0
' historians spent three years studying the archive , which once belonged to a @entity9 man @entity3 addressed his letters to his ' small , sweet , beloved wife ' and later ' beloved mummy			1
' but in 1938 he began a long term affair with his secretary @entity250 and fathered daughters @entity252 and @entity253 with her			0
he called her ' my dear love ' and the letters show he assauaged his guilt with his wife by sending her enormous food parcels later in the war from the conquered lands			2
the archive also reveals letters from @entity3 ’s and @entity43 ’s daughter @entity120 , now living as an 85 - year - old pensioner in @entity183 who assists still - surviving wanted @entity267 to keep out of the claws of justice through the sinister @entity271 - organisation			1
on the actual day of the invasion of the @entity273 the 13 - year - old @entity120 wrote to him with a presience the regime ’s hierachy did not possess : ' it 's awful that we make war against @entity74			0
when we take over the whole of @entity74 the fight will be very difficult			0
' the serialisation begins ahead of @entity284 on monday , which marks the date in january 1945 when the major @entity6 slaughterhouse of @entity153 was liberated by the @entity288			2
commenting on the publication , @entity289 , chief executive of the @entity290 , said : ' the @entity267 were not " monsters " but people who committed monstrous acts			0
' as these photos and letters show , @entity3 was a family man - which makes the choices he made elsewhere in his life all the more shocking and incomprehensible			1
