its been described as everything from terrifying to terrifc - and , with an estimated 68 million daily customers over 35,000 stores across the world , chances are you 're going to meet ' happy ' eventually			2
for the singing , dancing , talking ( and teethy ) red box is @entity10 's official new ambassador , even if the initial reaction has been anything but , well , happy			1
the slightly - menacing if very - simple mascot - an animated @entity15 box with @entity17 - like arms , a massive mouth and huge teeth - was introduced to @entity20 via @entity21 on monday as part of the chain 's continual healthy image - based overhaul			1
but the reception was hardly as warm as the fast food giant was expecting			1
the reaction was small , not super-sized entertainment site @entity34 called it ' an effective deterrent to both appetite and sleep '			0
according to @entity41 , other reactions included ' that ! is scary ' , ' @entity42 fail ' and ' this makes me crave @entity44 '			0
' so creepy , ' added another user , @entity45			0
' nightmare food , ' offered another , @entity47			0
but the mega-restaurant 's primary market for ' happy ' - as is a lot of the time with @entity10 's - is children			1
@entity53 was designed as an attempt to encourage to kids to think about food in a more healthy fashion , coinciding with the release of a new 50 - calorie serving of yoghurt and applie slices that can , on request , be served with a @entity15 instead of fries			1
small bottles of milk are also now available to replace soft drink			0
' at @entity67 , we 're always looking to bring fun and happiness to families , ' said @entity71 , senior director of @entity20 marketing , @entity67			2
the animated box also seems to have built for the meme and @entity76 age , with news clips and online campaigns spruiking specials and messages easily spread throughout social media			1
back in the day : the promotion of fast food has completely transformed over the last three decades			2
this ad , from 1984 , featured then - mascot @entity86 , stealing and eating as many cheeseburgers as possible image overhaul : to show they were doing their part to help fight @entity20 's obesitiy epidemic , @entity10 's started including apple slices and a smaller portion of french fries in its @entity15 in 2012			1
now , from july 4 , parents can opt to replace the fries with a serving of yoghurt compared to past mascots like @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity10 himself , it is a minimalistic , almost clinical approach			2
there is no back story or costume , just a box with a message			0
@entity10 's are said to have road - tested @entity53 in @entity111 in 2009 before unleashing him in the @entity20 , which is not only the restaurant 's home but its biggest market			1
the little guy has also appeared in @entity115 and @entity116			0
old school : up until recently , the @entity10 's stable of mascots featured @entity102 , @entity10 and @entity120			1
@entity10 underwent a makeover and now wears a sports jersey to appear more active @entity67 are n't the other ones having an overhaul			2
