by @entity0 published : 07:36 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 13:22 est , 6 december 2012 architect @entity1 who recreated @entity3 's sensuous curves in reinforced concrete and built the capital of @entity6 on the empty central plains as a symbol of the nation 's future has died at the age of 104			1
@entity12 , a spokeswoman for the @entity13 in @entity14 , said @entity1 died from a respiratory infection			1
he had been in hospital for several weeks and also on separate occasions earlier this year suffering from kidney problems , pneumonia and dehydration			2
' the most impressive thing is that his body suffered , but his mind was lucid , ' dr @entity48 said			1
' he did n't talk about death , never talked about death			1
' in works from @entity6 's crown - shaped cathedral to the undulating @entity66 building in @entity67 , @entity1 shunned the steel - box structures of many modernist architects , finding inspiration in nature 's crescents and spirals			1
his hallmarks include much of the @entity76 complex in @entity77 and the @entity30 in @entity31 , which is perched like a flying saucer across @entity79 from @entity14			1
' right angles do n't attract me			0
nor straight , hard and inflexible lines created by man , ' he wrote in his 1998 memoir @entity85			0
' what attracts me are free and sensual curves			0
the curves we find in mountains , in the waves of the sea , in the body of the woman we love			2
' shunned steel - boox structures : an overview of the @entity46 in @entity97 , @entity98 , whcih was @entity1 's last work positive to the end : @entity1 had been in hospital for several weeks and also on separate occasions earlier this year suffering from kidney problems , pneumonia and dehydration ' a work of art should cause the emotion of newness ' : a man walks past the @entity111 building , designed by @entity3 architect @entity1 , in the @entity113 in @entity6 evocative : a man walks near the @entity111 building , designed by @entity3 architect @entity1 , in the @entity113 in @entity6 shaping the world around him : a general view of the @entity111 building in the @entity113 in @entity6 , a city @entity1 built on the empty central plains free - flowing : the @entity1 - designed @entity119 , one of the buildings of the @entity122 , the government headquarters of the @entity3 state of @entity125 in @entity126 ' he never talked about death ' : @entity1 's physician said the architect worked on pending projects in the days before his death , taking visits from engineers his curves give sweep and grace to @entity6 , the city that opened up @entity3 's vast interior in the 1960s and moved the nation 's capital from coastal @entity14			1
@entity1 designed most of the city 's important buildings , while @entity144 - born , avant - garde architect @entity143 crafted its distinctive plane - like layout			0
@entity1 left his mark in the flowing concrete of the cabinet ministries and the monumental dome of the national museum			0
as the city grew to two million , critics said it lacked ' soul ' as well as street corners , ' a utopian horror ' , in the words of art critic @entity158			0
but @entity1 shrugged off the criticism			0
' if you go to @entity6 you might not like it , say there 's something better , but there 's nothing just like it , ' he said in an interview with @entity167 newspaper in 2006 at the age of 98			1
' i search for surprise in my architecture			0
a work of art should cause the emotion of newness			0
' pioneering : the @entity175 , known as @entity176 , in the city of @entity178 , which has become a model for modern urbanisation @entity1 pictured ( left ) in the shack he used for an office while building @entity3 's federal capital , @entity6 , and ( right ) while discussing one of his designs in 1960 striking design : the concrete framework for 108ft - high , 197ft - wide conical @entity188 created by @entity1 incredible : a view inside the @entity188 reveals just how astonishing @entity1 's design ideas were even late in life , @entity1 was striving for renewal			1
in 2009 , he came under heavy criticism for proposing to build a ' @entity196 ' in the heart of @entity6			1
preservationists said the 330ft obelisk he envisaged would mar the very skyline the architect created half a century earlier			0
@entity1 relented on the plaza , only to unveil new plans for a 165ft tower in the same spot			0
living well past the century mark , @entity1 's journey mirrored that of his beloved @entity3 , and his restless modernism captured the developing country 's sweeping ambitions			1
with hundreds of his buildings dotting the landscape , arguably no other architect shared as tight a bond with a country as @entity1 did with @entity3			1
@entity1 was born on december 15 1907 , in @entity14 , and earned his architecture degree at @entity14 's @entity216			1
working in @entity143 's office in 1936 , he helped design a @entity14 education ministry building that was a classic of functionalist horizontal and vertical lines			1
with modernist giant @entity220 , @entity1 developed the ' brise soleil ' , a heat protector that enhanced the building 's grid design and became an architectural standard in the 1960s			2
the cultural center ' @entity229 ' ( @entity230 ) in the @entity144 western town of @entity232 , designed in 1982 by @entity3 architect @entity1 distinctive : the @entity235 , one of the buildings of the @entity122 , which @entity1 designed inside the @entity1 centre : @entity1 said he found inspiration in the ' curves we find in mountains , in the waves of the sea , in the body of the woman we love ' beautiful : the sun is seen through the @entity249 and @entity250 in @entity6			1
@entity1 shrugged off criticism of @entity6 , saying ' there 's nothing just like it ' @entity1 teamed up again with @entity220 in 1947 to design much of the @entity76 complex in @entity77			1
after months of squabbling with architects - most notably @entity256 came up with the final plan for the complex , including the @entity260 , @entity261 and conference buildings and the @entity263			2
but @entity1 already was chafing at the limits of form - follows - function architecture			0
his first solo project was the @entity269 complex of buildings set on an artificial lake in the central @entity3 city of @entity126 , now @entity3 's third - largest metro area			2
for the first time , @entity1 employed the curves and arches that would become his hallmark			0
in the 1950s , @entity1 was summoned by president @entity278 to design a new capital on @entity3 's empty central high plains			1
@entity143 became the project 's urban planner			0
with the slogan of ' 50 years in five ' , mr @entity278 hoped to prod @entity3 into a great leap forward - and inward , away from the coast			2
@entity1 rose to the challenge , testing new forms and technical limits for reinforced concrete			0
his cone - shaped @entity291 is a circle of curved concrete pillars set like tepee poles with glass mosaic in between			0
' i did n't want an old - style cathedral - dark , a reminder of sin , ' he said in an interview in the 1990s			0
' i wanted something happier			0
' after a 1964 coup plunged @entity3 into a 21 - year military dictatorship , @entity1 , a lifelong communist , decided to spend more time in @entity304			2
while living in @entity144 in 1965 , he designed the headquarters of the @entity66			2
during the dictatorship he also designed the centre of the @entity309 publishing house in @entity310 , @entity311 in @entity312 and other projects in @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317 .			2

@entity3 died from respiratory infection in @entity14 hospital after months of ill health
was still working on projects and taking visits from engineers in the days before his death
physician : ' his body suffered , but his mind was lucid . he never talked about death '
he built capital of @entity6 and the undulating @entity66 building in @entity67
