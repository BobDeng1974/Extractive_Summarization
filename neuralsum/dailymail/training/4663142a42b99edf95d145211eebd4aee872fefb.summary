one of the options open to @entity1 for the may 2 date is a rematch with @entity182 if @entity1 opts to fight @entity182 then @entity2 could turn his attentions to @entity184 and with @entity1 and @entity2 pictured in the same room together for the first time , staff at the @entity49 in @entity7 were happy to add to the speculation by putting pictures of the two boxers on the big screen with the question ' coming in 2015 ?

if , however , @entity1 opts for a rematch with @entity182 , that paves the way for @entity2 to possibly fight @entity184			2
