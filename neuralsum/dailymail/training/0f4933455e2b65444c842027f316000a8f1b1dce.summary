the @entity33 minister said viewers were rightly ' shocked ' by programmes such as @entity35 and @entity34 and @entity117 , featuring people who spend their benefit money on luxuries such as cigarettes and wide - screen tvs , but that they had enabled the government to force through measures , which he said would put an end to the abuse			2
conservative mp @entity32 said the documentaries will leave working people ' irritated ' by the spending f those living on state handouts			0
@entity37 show @entity35 , which features people living on @entity35 in @entity133 , is helping to win the argument for benefits reform , mr @entity0 suggested the member for @entity137 asked mr @entity0 : ' have you managed to watch programmes like @entity35 and @entity34 and @entity39 ? ' if so , have you , like me , been struck by the number of people on there who manage to combine complaining about welfare reforms whilst being able to afford being able to buy copious amounts of cigarettes , have lots of tattoos done , watch @entity46 on the obligatory wide - screen television ? ' he added : ' do you understand the concerns and irritations of many of the people who go out to work every day , pay their taxes , who can not afford those kinds of luxuries themselves ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' many people are shocked by what they see , but the reality is that is why the public backs our welfare reform package , to get more people back to work , to end these abuses			1
' he said the last @entity31 government , which presided over ' massive spending and trapping people in a benefit dependency ' was to blame for the abuse .			0
