by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:19 est , 7 december 2013 updated : 17:19 est , 7 december 2013 art of the matter : @entity4 and her husband @entity5 , who want to take the @entity6 to @entity7 it seems an unlikely place to hang an @entity10			1
dubbed ‘ @entity13 ’ by locals , @entity4 ’s vast @entity7 mansion has 14 bedrooms , three hair salons and a walk - in wardrobe so large it has a second level accessed by an internal staircase			1
and that ’s not to mention the nightclub , bowling alley and ‘ motor court ’ for 100 vehicles , including her family ’s white @entity25 , white @entity28 and a black @entity29			2
yet , extraordinarily , this is the intended home of @entity6 ’s last known self - portrait , a £ 12.5million painting regarded as one of @entity35 ’s greatest cultural treasures			1
the government and the @entity37 are currently trying to save it for the nation			1
the @entity40 can reveal the @entity6 has been bought by @entity4 ’s 28 - year - old husband , @entity5			1
the painting was in private hands for more than four centuries and then bought by art dealer and @entity47 valuer @entity46 at auction in 2009 for £ 8.3million			1
he recently sold it to mr @entity5 for £ 12.5million , but the government has placed a temporary export ban on him taking it out of the country			1
the @entity37 and the @entity54 , the national fundraising charity for art , have now launched an unprecedented campaign to buy back the painting for the country			1
the former poet laureate @entity60 , who is leading the campaign , said : ‘ this is a self - portrait everybody can enjoy			1
' if we lose this painting , it will disappear into private hands and eyes and it will be lost to the world			2
but this is a painting about living in the world and the world is where it deserves to be			2
’ masterpiece : the @entity6 self - portrait was bought by mr @entity5 for £ 12.5m but the government has placed a temporary export ban on him taking it out of the country perhaps understandably , mr @entity5 disagrees			1
last night a spokesman for the businessman told @entity40 : ‘ @entity5 quite understands the authorities ’ point of view but he very much hopes he will be able to take it to his home in @entity7 and enjoy it			1
’ mr @entity5 married @entity88 ’s younger daughter in september 2011 , shortly after she bought the dynasty - style property , once the largest private residence in the @entity91 , for £ 55 million			1
@entity92 supremo @entity4 is worth an estimated £ 2.2billion – more than enough to stock up on the odd artwork or two			1
@entity94 , 24 , prefers modern art , once purchasing a @entity97 sculpture of twin @entity98 in bikinis , but it seems her husband has more traditional tastes			2
the walls of the 123 - room @entity7 mansion are said to be lined with portraits by sir @entity105 and sir @entity106 , the leading portrait painters in @entity108 in the 17th and early 18th centuries			1
@entity4 's vast @entity7 mansion , dubbed @entity13 , is the intended home of @entity6 's last known self - portrait , a painting regarded as one of @entity35 's greatest cultural treasures mr @entity5 , who also collects vintage @entity118 wine , told an @entity91 interviewer : ‘ all my @entity120 are important			1
' in @entity122 , the @entity121 has the @entity123 , which is a very famous group of pictures by the artist			0
' i ’ve been trying to rival the @entity123			0
i have more , i think , than him , and i ’m just five off the @entity129			0
’ this leaves art critic @entity131 distinctly unimpressed			0
‘ oh dear , ’ said mr @entity131			2
‘ i do n’t know him but if he ’s setting out to rival @entity122 and @entity134 , that ’s hardly a meritorious way of collecting			2
’ the smouldering @entity6 self - portrait would be the jewel in mr @entity5 ’s collection			1
painted by the @entity143 artist shortly before he died , possibly of the plague , in 1641 , there is no doubting its importance			0
@entity5 married @entity88 's younger daughter in september 2011 , shortly after she bought the dynasty - style property , once the largest private residence in the @entity91 according to @entity37 ’s director @entity156 , @entity6 , ‘ is one of the greatest artists to have worked in @entity35			1
no other artist has had such a dramatic impact on @entity155 portraiture ’			0
the @entity37 and the @entity54 now have three months to raise the money			1
it is the largest fundraising campaign the gallery has ever undertaken and , if successful , would be the fifth most - expensive acquisition by a @entity155 national museum			2
the @entity162 and @entity163 bought two @entity164 in 2009 and 2011 for a combined total of £ 95million , the @entity162 paid £ 22million for a @entity166 in 2004 , and last summer the @entity167 paid £ 23.1million for a constable			2
the @entity37 has secured £ 1.2million so far , including a £ 500,000 grant from the @entity54 and £ 700,000 from its own budget			1
art critic @entity131 has questioned the validity of buying the painting for £ 12.5m when it could have been bought four years ago for a much lower price and the campaign to save this great work is growing			1
in this week ’s edition of @entity179 , the famous girls in pearls feature was replaced by a full - page reproduction of the painting and a plea to help ‘ ensure the painting remains in @entity35 ’			1
critics , however , have questioned the validity of buying the painting for £ 12.5million when it could have been bought four years ago for a much lower price			1
mr @entity131 said : ‘ the painting must have been as important in 2009 as it is now			1
why did we not buy it then ? they did n’t try			0
they said they put their heads together with @entity35 to see whether they could do a joint purchase but they did n’t say a word in public			1
there was no question of raising funds from the public			0
‘ but now they ’re perfectly happy to start a fundraising campaign at £ 12.5million			0
the logic of it completely escapes me			0
‘ i am of the opinion that @entity156 is the most nittish wimp in the business			0
i think that really the man is so witless he should n’t be there			0
i think @entity60 is an ass			0
what i hate in all these things is the way they ’ll trundle in any talking head / personality / celebrity of whom a lot of people have heard			0
‘ i think he ’s the worst poet laureate we ’ve ever had , absolutely useless			2
he would n’t know the back of a picture from the front			0
i really think if you ’re going to adduce opinions on something , you should know something about it			0
‘ if the picture is as important as everyone ’s saying it is , it should have been bought at £ 8.3million			1
now that it has n’t , they ’re putting £ 4million in the pockets of @entity46			0
’ the decision to place an export ban on the @entity6 was based entirely on the cultural importance of the work			1
yet it must rub salt into the wounds of the art establishment that it may now end up in a property of such vulgar excess			0
‘ @entity13 ’ was built by former television producer @entity245			2
legend has it that his wife candy showed the architect a postcard of @entity134 and said : ‘ build me this			0
’ mr @entity131 says : ‘ well it does rather colour the argument			2
in intellectual terms , it should not matter but i do n’t know			0
‘ in the years i attempted to be an art dealer , i remember one rich man coming in to look at something			0
he decided he did n’t want it and , as he was leaving , he saw another picture and said , “ what is that ? ” i replied , “ oh , that ’s far too good for you			2
” ’ bizarrely , had mr @entity5 decided to keep the @entity6 at the couple ’s £ 66million @entity266 home ( a seven - storey house in @entity269 with 14 bedrooms ) the painting would have been his by now			1
the government only has the power to challenge the purchase of artworks if the owner wishes to remove them from the country			2
mr @entity131 explains : ‘ there are a very large number of highly important pictures in private possession in this country and most owners are very happy to lend when a picture is required for an exhibition			2
‘ if you took all those pictures away from all those people , you ’d have to quadruple the size of the @entity162			0
‘ so , in short , all those owners are , as it were , keepers and curators unpaid			0
they pay all the expense of the maintenance of the pictures , so private ownership is really a blessing in disguise			0
‘ but when a painting goes abroad , it tends never to come back			0
in other words , the loans do n’t happen so it ’s not quite the same			0
‘ quite often , when they ’re sharing an exhibition with , say , the @entity162 of @entity306 and @entity307 , you find that an @entity91 painting wo n’t come here			0
it ’s probably because they have some slight misgivings that we might step in and say that ’s a national treasure			0
’ if mr @entity5 ’s experience is anything to go by , they might have a point .			1
