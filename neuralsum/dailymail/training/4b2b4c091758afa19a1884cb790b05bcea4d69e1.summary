by @entity1 reporter students have found a new way to sneak marijuana into schools by using vapor pens that allow them to smoke without giving off the drug 's distinctive smell			1
since @entity10 legalized the drug , school administrators have had to fight back against students who finding creative ways to get high during class			1
edibles and inhalers that have been turned into makeshift bongs were two of the first ways that caught on , but now vapor pens are causing a more difficult problem because they are the most discrete			1
' i ’ve seen people in my math class and they ’ll be sitting there with the teacher and they ’ll be smoking it and they wo n’t even know , ' said @entity44 student @entity43			2
the plastic around the capsule is melted by the water in the pen and the user inhales a whiff of the result from a small mouthpiece at the end of the pen			0
when vapor pens are used by cigarette smokers , they insert a capsule of liquit nicotine as opposed to tobacco			2
because the water mixes with the oil , the smell normally associated with the drug is dilluted to a point that it is n't noticeable			0
tip off : users exhale the vapor , but can do it more discretely than this person so that teachers do n't notice the only possible tip off for teachers comes when some users exhale the vapor back out of their mouths , but that only lasts a second making it tough to pin down			2
principal @entity77 told @entity78 that teachers have been clued into the trend and are keeping an eye out for any suspicious activity			0
' the nervous habit of biting on your pen has a new meaning to it , ' mr @entity77 said			0
the trend is being helped by a prevalence of @entity90 videos that show people demonstrating how retool vapor pens for marijuana , showing ways to keep the smoke controlled while using it during class			1
all different flavors : vapor pens were originally used for cigarette smokers , and different flavors of nicotine were sold in @entity102 ( pictured ) but in @entity10 many are using the oil from marijuana plants instead to combat e-cigarettes becoming a gateway for other more harmful substances , @entity107 assembleywoman @entity106 introduced a bill last year making it illegal to sell e-cigarettes to minors			1
' once you try electronic cigarettes , you can become hooked to them , move on to cigarettes and then move on to other drugs , ' @entity106 told @entity120			0
some other states , including @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , have also banned the sale of e-cigarettes to minors .			0
