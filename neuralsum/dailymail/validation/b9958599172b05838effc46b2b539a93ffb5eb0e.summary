in the clip the writer looked uncomfortable as she danced with an aged local in @entity66 , @entity67 , for no ascertainable reason			1
and came across as ‘ a bit grand , awkward and bored , rather than enthusiastic ’ , according to one insider			1
‘ cringe - worthy ’ said another not that you would know it from her december 2014 column for the @entity75			2
excitedly describing her visit to @entity67 , @entity0 gushed about her experience of line - dancing and talked of the ' stunning ' mountain scenery			2
' @entity67 is real cowboy country , ' she continued			2
' everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big , non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards			2

taking a stroll in @entity112 , @entity0 looked super chic in her jeans and blazer combination that she topped off with a cute leopard scarf , blue pumps and a @entity118 bag			0
we were quite taken with the suede flats			0
as much as @entity120 loves our vertiginous heels , we all need our trusty flats to get us from day to day and these ones by @entity97 tick all the boxes			0
the suede material give the pumps a luxe feel but unfortunately they 're not available in the @entity10			0
not to be discouraged , we 've found plenty of other blue suede picks below so you can browse before you buy			0

ultimately @entity12 , it is said , was keen not to repeat the expensive mistake it made a couple of years back with @entity150			1
they were concerned that by spending a lot of money on a famous - by - association personality with no apparent aptitude for tv presenting , they would look gullible when that person failed to produce ratings			0
friends of @entity0 say she did n’t want to move to the @entity10 anyway as it would be too far away from @entity162 , the 37 - year - old investment banker she ’s been dating since 2012 , who now lives in @entity164			0
