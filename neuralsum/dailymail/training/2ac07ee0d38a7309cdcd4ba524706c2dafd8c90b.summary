prison : @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 - which can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a scathing report by the @entity60 of prisons in april , which said it was unacceptably dirty dental records and x-rays confirmed the body was of mr @entity11 , but it was too decomposed to find a cause of death			1
at an inquest , a transcript was read out of the interview between @entity3 and police			1
@entity5 - which is governed by @entity72 and can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a scathing report by the @entity60 of prisons in april , which said it was unacceptably dirty			1
the report , based on an inspection in november 2012 , added that there were high levels of assaults , many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs and some staff seemed to lack motivation			0
it also said : ‘ some communal areas were filthy even after they had been “ cleaned ” by wing cleaners , and waste was thrown out of cells into the exercise yards below , which went unchallenged			0
’ the prison said ' decisive action ' had been taken , and the @entity94 said the management team had been strengthened			0
it read : ‘ i do n’t know whether i grabbed him with one hand or two hands			0
i probably grabbed him round the throat			0
i left him on the ground , where i showed you , in the garden			0
’ he went on to say that he had hit the student from @entity108 , @entity109 , with a piece of wood , but it was not clear whether that had killed him			0
detective inspector @entity114 of @entity17 said : ‘ we have a dedicated investigation team working expeditiously to locate and apprehend @entity3 and to that end we are also liaising with our colleagues in @entity119 and in the @entity120			1
‘ we have information that gives us concern for his welfare and it is important that we trace him as soon as possible			0
it should be borne in mind that @entity3 was in an open part of the prison when he went missing			1
‘ however we would appeal to anyone who sees him not to approach him but to contact police immediately on 999			0
furthermore , we would urge anyone who may be helping him or sheltering him to contact us without delay			0

we are not complacent about this issue and are looking at ways in which the risk of absconding can be reduced further			0
‘ we are committed to ensuring that risk to the public is minimised			0
all those located in open conditions have been rigorously risk assessed and categorised as being of low risk to the public			2
’ @entity3 was believed to have been wearing a grey jumper , blue jeans and white trainers			1
he has had recent contact with family in the @entity15 and most of his friends are in the same area			1
