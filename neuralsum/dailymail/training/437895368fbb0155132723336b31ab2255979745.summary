@entity0 launched an assault on elements of his own supporters last night after a large number of @entity6 fans mocked the travelling @entity8 contingent over the @entity10 scandal			1
@entity0 was left appalled by crass and disgusting chants relating to the sex crimes committed by the late entertainer in @entity8 and , unprompted , demanded an end to vile chanting at matches			1
he said : ‘ i did n’t like the banter to be honest			1
i do n’t think it was respectful , i really do n’t			1
i do n’t care where he is from — that [ @entity10 ’s actions ] is an absolute disgrace			2
let ’s stop and think about what he has actually done			2
that ’s the most important thing and we do n’t see that			2
“ oh , it is a bit of banter ”			1
it is n’t funny , is it ? i do n’t think so			1
‘ nobody likes a laugh more than me but i ’m respectful — and that ’s what i ’m trying to show to @entity8			2
‘ until we make a stand the world ai n’t right			2
how often do we turn a blind eye to things ? i want to look after our people			2
some of the stewards are n’t as big as me			0
why ca n’t people in the stand say , “ @entity54 this guy out ? ” coming into a ground does n’t give you the right to say those things			0
’ @entity6 have worked hard in recent years to tidy their unruly image , with @entity0 highlighting the fact that they were rated as having the most improved family experience last season			1
banter ? the @entity6 manager is known for his quirky sense of humour but said that the chants were not funny he added : ‘ i am bursting with pride about my club , but i will ask my fans if they think that is right			1
’ the fans ’ behaviour took the shine of an impressive @entity6 win that exposed the weaknesses of @entity8 ’s playing staff at a time when their off - field antics are drawing scrutiny			1
for @entity86 , this defeat — inflicted by goals from @entity84 and @entity85 — was bad			0
the only consolation was that the second half was not as bad as the first and , perhaps , the man known as the manager eater will have no appetite for head coaches			1
@entity86 was quick to make the distinction in terminology as he attempted to explain a performance that will not have escaped @entity98 ’s attention			0
how could it when the @entity100 goes where the team goes			0
he was in the dugout before the game , and briefly on the touchline ahead of kick - off to talk to the groundsman			0
showing the way : @entity0 is trying to make @entity6 a better place for fans to go to watch football he was also in the dressing room and exchanged a handshake with his head coach			1
but there were no words , even if there was , presumably , a lot to say after a showing as weak as this			0
@entity86 said : ‘ i will talk to the owner tomorrow			0
i saw him before the game , i shook his hand afterwards			0
he was talking to the @entity6 groundsman about i do n’t know what — he wants to learn about @entity127 football			1
’ he wo n’t have liked much of what he learned here			0
@entity130 was left unmarked for the opener , @entity129 blew a great chance to equalise early in the second half and @entity85 secured the points for @entity6 with a late penalty			1
‘ first half we did n’t perform , did n’t stick to the game plan , ’ @entity86 said			0
‘ second half we got their attention and made a fist of it			0
but football is about moments			0
’ at this moment , @entity8 have a lot to work on .			0

@entity0 calls out @entity6 fans chanting about *paedophile*
@entity6 manager labels elements of his club *'s* support ' *disrepectful* '
@entity0 says it goes beyond ' a bit of banter ' and is *n't* funny
