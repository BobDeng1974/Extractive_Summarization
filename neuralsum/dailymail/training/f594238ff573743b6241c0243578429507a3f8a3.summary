@entity7 have voted in favour of strict new targets forcing each country to reduce plastic bag use by 80 per cent before 2019 ( file picture ) backed by the @entity23 , campaigners have successfully fought for a supermarket plastic bag charge in @entity25 , which will be introduced in 2015			1
every other @entity6 nation will now have to bring in similar measures if they are to meet the strict target - or leave themselves open to large fines			2
@entity30 suggest they will either have to introduce a charge for bags or tax shops which give them out for free			2
the @entity6 directive , which will pass into law in the coming weeks , also removes blocks to outright bans on plastic bags for the first time			2
@entity41 of the @entity42 said : ' this is a fantastic result and will lead to the drastic reduction of single use carrier bags given out throughout @entity1			0
' an estimated 100 billion carrier bags are used every year in @entity1 - with 8 billion ending up as litter			0
many of those end up in seas and rivers , killing millions of marine animals			0
the decision is a huge boost for conservationists , who have been fighting for years to reduce the huge volumes of devastating plastic litter harming the environment a 2004 study of wildlife in the @entity60 found 96 per cent of dead sea birds had fragments of plastic in their stomachs			1
@entity65 announced last year that supermarkets and other large stores in @entity68 will have to charge 5p for plastic bags from 2015			1
@entity70 and @entity71 have already introduced charges for bags and have seen the volume of plastic bag litter plummet as a result			1
@entity77 is currently facing legal action from the @entity79 , after launching @entity1 's first plastic bag ban in 2011			1
that case will now be dropped , paving the way for other nations to follow suit with an outright ban on lightweight bags			0
backed by the @entity23 , campaigners have successfully fought for a supermarket plastic bag charge in @entity25 , which will be introduced in 2015 @entity89 , environment spokesman for the @entity90 in @entity1 said : ' discarded plastic bags are killing millions of marine animals each year			1
it 's become a massive problem across @entity1 and one we must deal with together			0
' every country has the right to decide what action to take , but the need to reduce the huge volumes of plastic waste we create should not be in dispute			1
' but @entity104 @entity30 say the rules will place an ' unreasonable burden ' on businesses			0
a @entity104 spokesman in @entity109 said : ' conservatives agree that action needs to be taken to reduce the distribution of these bags			0
' discarded plastic bags are killing millions of marine animals each year			0
it 's become a massive problem across @entity1 and one we must deal with together ' - @entity89 ' discarded plastic bags are an iconic symbol of waste and a visible form of littering , and the environmental impact extends beyond littering to their production and disposal in landfill			0
' however , the current proposals are muddled over just how plastic - bag consumption should be measured and recorded			2
' existing and planned domestic legislation in the @entity25 requires reporting on consumption of lightweight plastic bags by large retailers			2
' so extending the legislation to include ultra-light plastic bags , and bringing small businesses into the scope , brings an unreasonable burden			0
' @entity139 mp , chair of the @entity140 said : ' the vote by @entity142 is another reminder of the importance of reducing the litter and environmental damage that unnecessary use of plastic bags can cause			2
' a simple and consistent 5p charge for all single - use carrier bags in all stores is the best way to have the biggest impact and to achieve reductions in use of 80 per cent or more			0
