by @entity1 reporter published : 23:27 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 08:51 est , 26 august 2013 while promoting his new film in a television interview friday , actor @entity2 discussed the recent incident in which he was accused of shoplifting at a @entity7 market and took the opportunity to address @entity7 ’s stop and frisk policy and racial politics in @entity12 in general			1
while talking about @entity14 , a film that revolves around @entity12 ’s civil rights movement and also stars @entity16 , film critic @entity13 asked the 52 - year - old what it felt like to be the victim of racial profiling despite his many successes			1
‘ i was angered , ’ said @entity2 , who is black , in the interview which aired on @entity24			2
‘ it ’s a humiliating thing for someone to come and do that			2
it ’s attempted dis - empowerment			1
‘ most of the stop and frisk , ’ began the actor , though @entity13 had asked only how @entity2 felt about his own false shoplifting accusation			1
‘ nine out of the ten , the person is not a criminal			2
they do n’t ticket them , or they do n’t arrest them			0
99 percent of them do n’t have a weapon			0
so i think there ’s something that has to be examined			0
’ @entity2 did eventually get around to discussing his own brush with racial profiling , but would only say how he turned it into a positive			0
co-stars : @entity2 stars in the @entity65 with @entity16 , who was herself the victim of racial profiling by a @entity68 saleswoman who refused to sell her a purse ‘ it ’s attempted disempowerment , ’ he said			0
‘ and for me it just spurred me into action			0
’ the vehicle for that action , @entity2 said , came in the form of his @entity77 which , according to a foundation video , seeks to build inroads toward peaceful resolutions in areas of conflict around the world			0
the shoplifting snafu occurred in february , when @entity2 was perusing the aisles at the @entity86 in @entity88 ’s @entity87 when an employee approached him and made the accusation , according to @entity91			1
the worker then frisked the @entity94 actor in front of the other customers as if he was a lowly thief			1
not surprisingly , the employee turned up no contraband on @entity100 's body , and the actor left the story in a fury			1
five finger apology : a worker at @entity86 on the @entity87 falsely accused @entity2 of stealing ' frisking individuals without proof / evidence is a violation of rights , ' @entity2 's rep told @entity91 at the time			1
the statement continued : ' this was an upsetting incident given the fact that @entity100 did nothing more than walk into the deli			2
' what is most unfortunate about this situation is the inappropriate way store employees are treating patrons of their establishment			0
' the actor took the higher ground and did n't call the authorities on the employee , instead reasoning with the store manager to ' change their behavior ' and ' treat the public in a fair and just manner			2
