' i had no idea what it was or where it had come from			0
' the only giveaway was the @entity143 stamp on the top of it so i knew it had something to do with the military			0
' it also had a very strange dial on the top with each letter of the alphabet on it			0

' they then sent it to the @entity33 and the @entity35 to study			0
' the experts there told me it was a beacon lamp that would have been used for beach landings such as the @entity69 raids			1
' it is incredible to think this lamp could have been used in the d - day landings			1
' as i understand it , very few of these exist now , probably because they would have been left behind or thrown away once the job had been done			0
