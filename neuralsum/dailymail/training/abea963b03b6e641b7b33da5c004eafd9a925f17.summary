like many of its well - heeled clientele the luxury brand loves to show off about how fabulous it is and recent marketing activities have included a model wetting herself with excitement at the prospect of the shop 's seasonal sale , a ' walk of shame ' , and beefy bulldogs being touted around in pricey handbags			0
but it was the 2012 ' love thyself ' beauty campaign that really got @entity20 's knickers in a twist			1
the @entity22 has decided not to uphold complaints against @entity1 for it 2012 ' @entity25 ' campaign the glossy images used to promote the store 's new @entity28 beauty hall featured three glamorous models appearing to lean in to kiss themselves in a reflection			1
a ' @entity34 ' strapline accompanied the headshots to reflect the narcissistic theme of the shoot			2
a press release at the time of the launch said : ' these advertisements bring to life the promise at the heart of our @entity46 , @entity1 store which is ; after pampering and indulging yourself from head to toe across three floors of beauty , looking in the mirror will be a captivating experience and you â€™ll fall in love with yourself all over again			2
' but not everyone appreciated the self - loving sentiment			0
the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) received 17 complaints about the adverts : nine that the images were unsuitable to be seen by children because they appeared to show a lesbian kiss , 10 that they were sexually explicit and two that the phrase ' love thyself ' in combination with the pictures was offensive on religious grounds			1

but @entity1 also argued that even though the adverts were n't intending to be sapphic images of lesbians were not offensive or inappropriate and should be accepted by the @entity22			1
@entity1 said : ' the advertising industry should be in the vanguard of those promoting and supporting the equalities espoused by anti-discrimination laws , including those concerning sexual orientation			0
' the @entity22 said : ' we acknowledged that some complainants had interpreted the posters differently and had understood them to depict a lesbian kiss			1
' one person also mentioned a young child who had not identified that the kiss was between one woman and her mirror image			0
' although we recognised that some people might have found what they perceived to be a portrayal of a lesbian kiss distasteful , we considered that a reference to homosexuality in an ad would be unlikely in itself to cause widespread or serious offence or constitute irresponsible advertising			2
