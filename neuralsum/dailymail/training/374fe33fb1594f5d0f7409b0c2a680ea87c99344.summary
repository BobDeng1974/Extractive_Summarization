executed : @entity0 , seen in this undated photo , was executed on tuesday using an untried drug a @entity4 man convicted of raping and murdering a 21 - year - old woman in 1986 blinked repeatedly and shook his head back and forth as he was executed by lethal injection of a controversial , never - before - used drug			1
@entity0 , 51 , was the first death row inmate to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride - despite concerns it might not work as promised and could inflict cruel and unusual punishment on a death row inmate			1
the execution began at 6.02pm at @entity16 in @entity17			1
@entity0 's eyes opened and he blinked several times			1
he closed them and opened them again two minutes later			2
he then yawned and his jaw dropped open			0
at 6.08pm , the official overseeing the execution tugged at @entity0 's eyelids and grasped his shoulder to check for a response			1
a minute later , @entity0 's head began moving back and forth and shortly thereafter his breathing stopped			1
he was pronounced dead at 6.16pm			1
@entity0 appeared to remain conscious for a greater length of time and made more body movements after losing consciousness than people executed by the old formula which usually kills the prisoner within seven minutes			1
@entity38 , typically used by doctors for sedation , was the first of three drugs pumped into @entity0 as part of a lethal injection cocktail designed to induce unconsciousness , paralysis and death by cardiac arrest			1
the first of the drugs administered as part of the lethal injection ' protocol ' in @entity4 has long been the barbiturate pentobarbital			1
but @entity4 and other death penalty states that use a trio of drugs as part of their injection procedures have been running out of pentobarbital since its manufacturer clamped a ban on its use in future executions			1
' this is somewhat of an experiment on a living human being , ' @entity64 , executive director of the @entity65 in @entity66 , said monday			0
' the three - drug process depends on the first drug rendering the inmate unconscious and , if he is only partially unconscious , the inmate could be experiencing extreme pain , ' he added			1
' because the second drug paralyzes him , he would be unable to cry out or show that he 's in pain			1
' the 51 - year - old @entity0 , who had abandoned his appeals and said he was ready to die , was condemned for the 1986 abduction , rape and murder of @entity81 , whose body was found on a canal bank near @entity84 in central @entity4			1
@entity0 was calm when he met with two spiritual advisers , including a @entity87 priest who administered last rites , according to @entity90 spokeswoman @entity89			1
for his last meal , @entity0 had a 12 - ounce box of assorted chocolates and 1 1/2 quarts of @entity95 chocolate ice - cream			1
' to my agonizing shame , i must confess to the crime , ' he said in a slow , deliberate voice before the injection was given			2
' i wish to offer my most sincere , heartfelt apology			0
i have prayed for the good lord to forgive me for my sins			0
but i understand why those here can not			0
' @entity81 's mother and two siblings died before they could see the sentence carried out , but @entity81 's surviving sisters and brothers traveled to @entity17 to watch as @entity0 was executed			1
lethal dose : @entity0 was the first death row inmate to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride , pictured , despite concerns it might not work as promised and could inflict undue pain just last week , @entity117 postponed an execution set for october 23 due to uncertainty about using a different drug , propofol , as a substitute for pentobarbital			1
@entity124 , a spokeswoman for the @entity125 , declined to comment on how the state could rest assured that midazolam would avoid inflicting pain and suffering on @entity0			1
but she said the prison system ' did research and determined that this is the most humane and dignified way to do the procedure			0
' she refused to identify a research laboratory or other source of the department 's scientific data , citing an exemption in state public record laws that also meant that the supplier of midazolam hydrochloride for executions could remain anonymous			1
' we 're not talking about details , ' she said			0
' that could impact the safety and security of the process			0
' @entity0 's lawyer , @entity147 of @entity148 , said there were no late motions to stay the execution			1
@entity0 told a circuit judge in @entity153 , @entity4 , last month that he did not want to continue the court appeals that have kept him on @entity4 's death row for nearly a quarter - century			1
another condemned @entity4 prisoner , @entity156 , has a hearing set for a november 6 in @entity159 's federal court , challenging the use of midazolam			1
@entity156 's appeal contends that there is ' substantial risk ' of midazolam not working completely , violating the @entity167 's prohibition of ' cruel and unusual punishment ' by subjecting the condemned to a painful paralysis and fatal heart seizure over several minutes			1
@entity81 was making her first long trip through @entity4 on @entity172 weekend in 1986 but she never arrived at her destination			1
victim : @entity81 , pictured , was just 21 when she was kidnapped , raped and murdered by @entity0 in 1986			1
@entity0 was executed on tuesday she prearranged with her friend to meet at a convenience store in @entity84 so she could be guided the last few miles of the trip			1
@entity81 found the store , but before she could get to the pay phone , @entity0 smashed her car window , kidnapped her			1
he beat her , raped her and strangled her with her pants before throwing her body into a canal			2
@entity81 's brother @entity185 has pushed for years through an online petition and an email campaign to ensure @entity0 was executed for what he did to his sister			1
' he killed my sister , he took her life			2
but when he took that life , he created so many other victims , ' @entity81 said			1
' what he did affected everybody			0
it ate my mother up			0
i changed jobs and moved all within three months			0

that trip never happened because of the murder			0
@entity245 traveled from @entity289 to @entity206 the weekend @entity81 was murdered			2
at one point @entity81 had talked about staying in town if @entity245 was going to be there			2
but instead she kept her plans to meet a friend from college and spend some time on the @entity295			2
' it 's before cellphones and before @entity298 , she 's trying to take a trip and she took all these precautions			2
she put a radio in the back seat to play loud so she would n't fall asleep , she told her roommates where she was going , she had this whole route all mapped out , ' @entity245 said			0

@entity0 , who killed and raped @entity81 , 21 , in 1986 , was pronounced dead at 6.16pm on tuesday at @entity16 in @entity17
he was the first to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride , despite concerns it might not work as promised or could inflict undue pain
@entity0 was pronounced dead 14 minutes after injection - double the *amount* of time it typically takes using the old formula
drug replaces the barbiturate pentobarbital , which has long been the first of the drugs administered in @entity4 *...* but which is in short supply
it 's believed the use of the drug was *successful* and now other death penalty states are likely to begin using it
