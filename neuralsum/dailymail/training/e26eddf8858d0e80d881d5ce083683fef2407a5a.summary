@entity9 and @entity10 *decided* to take wedding photos in front of @entity15 's @entity14 - as rap group 7262 filmed a music video
a photo of the @entity10 ' wedding party posing with the rappers later appeared online - along with two different fake text messages that *falsely* listed the bride 's name as ' @entity43 ' and ' @entity48 '
those texts show the bride accidentally inviting someone to her wedding and trying to uninvite the guest - but the stranger replies ' we still coming '
the photo and messages *quickly* went viral on social media and started the @entity168 trend *#* *westillcoming*
7262 later released the video for ' anthem ' in early july , featuring the wedding party dancing with them
