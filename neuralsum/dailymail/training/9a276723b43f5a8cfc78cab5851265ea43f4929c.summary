@entity0 said sir @entity1 would be his inspiration in winning the @entity5 manager ’s job on a permanent basis , but this was more like @entity9 ’s nerve - shredding entertainers			1
at times , the performance was brilliant , at others baffling			0
crucially , though , @entity9 ’s swashbucklers of the mid nineties invariably scored one more than the opposition			0
but to share six goals with relegation candidates @entity16 – three times squandering the lead – was not what caretaker boss @entity0 had hoped for in part one of his audition for the leading role at his hometown club			1

in the end , the @entity93 were fortunate to escape with a point			2
four times @entity82 ’s side cracked the woodwork and the @entity30 crowd grumbled their irritation on full - time at the surrender of maximum points			0
@entity0 – in charge with @entity104 having quit for @entity105 - concedes he was mystified by his side ’s collapse			1
‘ it was like the old days when @entity9 ( @entity112 ) was manager , ’ reflected @entity0 , who revealed he has lost @entity60 to an achilles injury for the remainder of the season			1
‘ i ’ve never been involved in a football match where that cliche of two halves was so apparent			0
‘ that was some of the best football we ’ve played in the first half			0
we could have been two or three up			0
we passed it well , our movement was good and we were positive			0
‘ but they were direct in the second half and we did not know how to deal with their approach			0
‘ i ’m so disappointed because we were so good in the first half and so poor the second			0
we were lucky to get away with a point			0
@entity16 should have won the game			2
‘ if i was a @entity5 fan sitting in the stand then i ’d be going to the pub and i ’d be disappointed			2
’ @entity60 celebrates after scoring the opening goal for @entity5 against @entity16 at @entity30 on @entity132 @entity60 jumps to score with a header as @entity5 take the lead against @entity16 in the 15th minute @entity5 's @entity46 ( left ) shows his dejection after scoring an own goal as @entity16 equalise in the 19th minute the ball hits the back of the @entity5 net as @entity46 scores an own goal at @entity30 @entity47 ( right ) wheels away after putting @entity5 back in the lead in the 26th minute @entity47 ( centre ) celebrates with his team - mates as @entity5 move 2 - 1 ahead in the @entity35 clash with @entity16 @entity79 celebrates after scoring an equaliser for @entity16 against @entity5 in the 66th minute @entity60 , @entity47 and @entity36 had given @entity5 the lead , but on each occasion the @entity16 found an equaliser			1
their final leveller came four minutes from time when @entity26 smashed through the weak grasp of rookie goalkeeper @entity154			1
earlier , a @entity46 own goal and @entity79 ’ fifth of the season had restored parity			1
@entity16 came from two down to claim a point at @entity160 on sunday and , while they still remain in the drop zone , @entity82 – who was forced into three changes before half - time - has reason for positivity			1
‘ it was interesting day at office , i ’ve never experienced losing three players to illness or injury so early in the game , ’ he said			0
‘ but i could not be more proud of the players			0
some of our quality was outstanding			0
‘ @entity5 were excellent for 25 minutes			1
but our response just shows the unshakable desire and belief we have in each other			0
‘ @entity181 said how bright we were in our forward play the other day and i ’m happy with the energy and endeavour of the team			0
‘ my belief is still there that we will stay up			0
’ it had been an absorbing affair			0
the game was just 54 seconds old when @entity79 sprung @entity74 clear and his stab cannoned off the upright with @entity154 beaten			2
but it was @entity5 who seized the lead			2
they went two years without netting from a corner under @entity104 and he had even ordered his analysis staff to produce a report of all goals from flag - kicks in the @entity35 in a bid to find a scoring formula			1
@entity16 's @entity65 receives treatment as he lies on the pitch injured during the first half @entity65 is carried off injured on a stretcher at @entity30 just 20 minutes after coming on as a substitute @entity0 ( centre ) sits on the home bench and chats with @entity5 coach @entity212 ( left ) @entity16 manager @entity82 shouts instructions from the touchline at @entity30 @entity47 became the first @entity5 player to score and provide an assist in the same league game this season			1
under @entity0 , though , it took just 15 minutes			2
@entity47 delivered from the right and @entity60 rose to glance home from six yards			1
within four minutes the visitors were level , @entity46 inadvertently nodding a dropping ball over @entity225 and into his own net from 10 yards			2
no matter , the mood during those early exchanges dictated that @entity0 ’s team would simply go in search of another and they were duly back in front on 26 minutes			1
@entity42 rolled a short pass to @entity47 and he laced delightfully into the bottom corner from 25 yards			1
but that was where their dominance faded			0
within minutes of the restart after half - time the outstanding @entity79 sized a curler from the edge of the area and , when that cracked the underside of the bar and bounced out , @entity74 headed against the base of the post before a relieved @entity154 smothered			1
@entity5 's @entity36 ( left ) advances with the ball as @entity16 's @entity69 gives chase @entity16 's @entity66 ( left ) tackles @entity5 's @entity49 during the @entity35 clash on thursday @entity5 's @entity52 ( right ) is closed down near the touchline by @entity16 's @entity67 ( centre ) @entity16 's @entity74 ( right ) climbs above @entity5 's @entity42 ( second right ) to head the ball towards goal again @entity5 needed the frame of the goal to preserve their lead when @entity259 ’s header – from @entity70 ’ corner – smashed the crossbar			1
@entity72 swept over a cross from the left and @entity79 , peeling off @entity46 , flicked his header into the bottom corner			1
at this juncture you ’d wager on only one side scoring again , and it was n’t @entity5			2
in @entity49 , though , they have unearthed a star			0
and it was the @entity274 ’s jinking run and cross – mishit by @entity53 – which allowed @entity36 to steam in and place beyond @entity62			2
but @entity16 did not deserve defeat and so it was that @entity26 pounced as they again came from behind to claim an invaluable point in their fight for survival			1
for @entity0 , he was just relieved it had not been all three .			2

@entity60 scored the opening goal for @entity5 in the 15th minute
@entity16 equalised just four minutes later as @entity46 scored an own goal
@entity47 put the @entity93 back in front in the 26th minute
@entity79 flicked a header into the bottom corner to make the score 2 - 2 in the 66th minute
@entity36 made it 3 - 2 for the hosts with just 12 minutes to go
@entity26 was the late hero for the @entity16 as he scored an equaliser in the 86th minute
@entity0 took caretaker charge of @entity5 following the departure of @entity104 to @entity105
