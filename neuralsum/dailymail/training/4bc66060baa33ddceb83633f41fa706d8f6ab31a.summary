by @entity0 @entity1 watched @entity2 beat top - flight opposition for the first time in two years on tuesday night — then vowed they are more than a match for any team in knockout competition			1
@entity9 ’s 78th - minute deflected winner against @entity10 secured @entity2 ’ seventh consecutive win of the season and set up a trip to @entity14 in the last 16 of the @entity16 next midweek			1
it also kept @entity2 in the hunt for their first cup triumph since they defeated @entity20 in the final in 2011 , with @entity1 insisting his team have no reason to fear anyone			2
@entity9 hits the @entity2 goal , the only strike of the night , to put @entity1 's side into the next round a crowd of around only 15,000 supporters celebrate victory but @entity1 insisted it did n't matter to him ‘ yes , we got a break with the goal but it was a result we deserved , ’ said @entity1 , whose team last beat a @entity35 side in september 2012 with a 2 - 0 win over @entity37 in the @entity16			1
‘ i do n’t think anyone could grudge us the win			2
we were the team that looked most like scoring			2
‘ what does this win tell us about where @entity2 are ? what we ’ve done tonight is put out a team that is joint top of the top division and had n’t lost a game or a goal until saturday			1
‘ what that shows us is that in a one - off cup game we are capable of playing against anyone			2
’ on a night when just 15,208 turned up at @entity58 , amid supporter discontent with the board , there was a small protest at the end when the @entity64 fans group held up a banner behind the directors box proclaiming : ‘ enough is enough , give us our club back ’			1
while admitting he would have preferred a larger crowd , @entity1 was just delighted to please the supporters			0
‘ i am happy to make the fans smile , yes			2
i said before the game we are duty bound to train our energy on things we can have a bearing on — and we ’ve sent the @entity2 fans home with a smile tonight			1
the @entity2 players congratulate @entity9 as they triumphed over top - flight opponents at last @entity1 was delighted with the win and said a big part of his job is to make the fans happy ‘ i ’ve no doubt there were also thousands sitting round radios and watching televisions with a smile on their faces , too			1
that ’s a very big part of our job and it makes us feel good			0
‘ i can understand it ( the attendance )			0
i want the stadium full , of course i do			0
i am the manager and the fuller the stadium the better			0
but i can understand what ’s going on			0
‘ but i ’m doing my level best not to get involved in it			0
i ca n’t have a bearing on that but i can have a bearing on picking teams and getting results like we did tonight			0
’ @entity1 praised match - winner @entity9 , 20 , who put a serious viral infection behind him at the turn of the year to become a key member of the team			1
@entity2 faced a real battle but came through it to win despite the mostly empty stadium ‘ @entity9 is terrific , ’ he said			1
‘ we asked him to contribute more goals and assists and that little bit of a killer instinct — and he ’s certainly given us that			0
‘ he showed great maturity and intelligence to stay switched on tonight for his goal			1
when others were claiming for the handball — which i did n’t really think it was — he kept his wits about him with the ball in play and struck the winner			0
‘ he ’s got a good head on young shoulders			0
‘ i ’m not putting any pressure on him after the time he ’s had but it ’s just great to see him back and entertaining our fans			1
they clearly — and rightly — are taking him to their hearts			0
‘ how far can he go in the game ? in the history of @entity2 , we ’ve had some great young players come through			2
i hope @entity9 does as well as some of them			1

@entity9 scores the only goal of the game
