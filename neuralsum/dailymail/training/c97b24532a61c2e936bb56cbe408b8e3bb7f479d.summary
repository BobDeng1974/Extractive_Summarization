by @entity0 in 1943 , @entity2 troops commandeered the hamlet of @entity4 on @entity5 to prepare for the d - day landings			1

commanded by retired @entity14 major @entity13 , 61 , the insects are given the opportunity to thrive in one of the last wilderness area in the @entity2			1
with permission from the @entity20 , he watches over 150 hives dotted across the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) that has never been treated with modern pesticides			0
it is the perfect spot for the beekeeper , who wants to reintroduce @entity2 's population of indigenous bees , as it is five miles from the nearest colony of foreign insects			2
' the area is very rich in wild flowers , ' he said			0
' eighteen of the 22 top nectar producing plants in the @entity2 are right here , including clover , sainfoin , viper â€™s bugloss , knapweed and melilot			0
there is also no interference from the public			0
' about 95 per cent of bees in the @entity2 are non-native and were introduced here in the 1920s after a disease virtually wiped out the population			1

colony : major @entity13 , 61 , commands an astonishing 8 million bees in a 150 different hives near the abandoned village of @entity4 on @entity62 's @entity5 thriving : the isolated plain is covered with a range of wild flowers across the @entity66 ( @entity22 ) , creating a perfect habitat for the bees growth : the retired @entity14 major is hoping to reintroduce @entity2 's native black bee			1
most of the indigenous species was wiped out by disease in the 1920s @entity76 : the wet winter and dry spring have produced perfect conditions for the diverse flora of the grasslands which , in turn , have created a cornucopia of nectar unique : the weather will result in a distinctive flavour of honey ( right ) being produced in one of @entity2 's last wilderness areas new career : the retired @entity14 major from @entity5 , has been given special permission by the @entity93 to set up 14 colonies of black bees isolated : @entity96 chose the area in @entity62 because the colony will not be affected by foreign flying insects closed off : @entity4 , near @entity100 in @entity62 , was one of several villages in @entity2 to be taken over by the army in the @entity103 so troops could practise for @entity105			1
