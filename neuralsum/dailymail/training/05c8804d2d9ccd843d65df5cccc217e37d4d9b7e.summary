by @entity0 and @entity1 a city firm that was paid £ 1.5million to advise the government on the sale of @entity6 also made a fortune for its clients from selling shares in the postal giant , it emerged yesterday			2
the controversial stock market float made billions for investors but left taxpayers £ 750million out of pocket on the first day of trading			2
now it has been revealed that while one branch of firm @entity20 advised on the sale , another arm of the same company made millions selling the shares			0
prime minister @entity23 repeatedly insisted the sell - off had been a success but @entity27 leader said the deals with hedge funds mean the privatisation ' stinks ' @entity31 is the parent company of @entity20 , which was one of the companies to advise the government , and @entity35 , which bought and sold the shares			1
@entity35 was given a special allocation of six million shares in @entity6 as a ‘ priority ’ investor			0
by comparison , ordinary investors were typically given just £ 750 each , while anybody who applied for more than £ 10,000 of shares was given nothing			0
@entity35 bought and sold them all within days and made an instant profit of £ 8million for its clients – making a mockery of business secretary @entity51 ’s insistence that @entity6 shares should only be sold to long - term , stable investors			2
during a heated grilling by @entity55 , @entity20 insisted that the two arms of the company were ring - fenced			2
but @entity55 said its involvement in both aspects of the sale was ‘ inappropriate ’			0
senior @entity51 minister @entity51 has faced calls to resign over his handling of the @entity6 privatisation - but has insisted he has nothing to apologise for speaker @entity65 tried to humiliate @entity23 in the @entity66 today by cutting him off mid-sentence			1
during raucous exchanges at @entity23 's questions , mr @entity23 was shouted down by @entity55			1
as the @entity23 tried to attack @entity27 's criticism of the @entity6 sell - off , mr @entity65 stood to intervene			1
mr @entity23 remarked : ' i 've not finished			1
' but smiling broadly , mr @entity65 hit back : ' the prime minister has finished and he can take it from me he has finished			1
' the slapdown marks a new low in the relationship between mr @entity23 and mr @entity65 , who was a @entity78 mp before becoming speaker			1
for the past six months , the government has refused to reveal the name of the 16 ‘ priority ’ investors , insisting the information was confidential			0
but mr @entity51 broke his silence yesterday and published the list , saying it was in the public interest			0
other top investors include sovereign wealth funds , such as the @entity91 , and the @entity92 , run by billionaire investor @entity93			0
@entity94 , the hedge fund whose former chief executive sir @entity95 is a large donor to the @entity78 , was another big winner			0
@entity99 , a managing director at @entity35 , told mps on the @entity101 that it had set a ‘ price target ’ for the shares of £ 3.95			1
they were floated at £ 3.30 , a price which @entity20 had advised the government was the maximum price which @entity108 investors were prepared to pay			1
mr @entity99 said the decision had been made to sell the shares when the price reached £ 4.70 within the first few days of trading			2
mr @entity99 told @entity55 : ‘ we had a price target			2
the share price went beyond the price target and , yes , we did sell on behalf of the clients of @entity118			1
on behalf of the clients we made approximately £ 8million			0
’ he added that the profit for @entity35 itself was only around £ 40,000			0
business secretary @entity51 has come under fire from all sides over his handling of the controversial @entity6 sell - off @entity125 , chief executive of @entity20 , said : ‘ when we became aware , having been hired , that @entity35 were on a list of investors the @entity6 were talking to , we made it quite clear that we should have no input whatsoever into any discussions about allocations for @entity35			1
‘ the chinese wall is complete and utter			0
we have had no contact throughout			0
’ @entity27 mp @entity134 , who chairs the committee , said the situation was ‘ just inappropriate ’ , and said the finance world was like an ‘ institutional masonic lodge ’			0
despite strict ring - fencing systems in place , known as @entity142 walls , she said : ‘ it just feels wrong ’ , adding : ‘ it ends up with too cosy a relationship and what then happened was this little group of very high asset management [ firms ] made a killing at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer who lost out to the tune on day one of £ 750million			2
’ yesterday @entity27 leader @entity155 accused @entity23 of ‘ ripping off the taxpayer ’ after the government ‘ grossly under - valued ’ the postal giant .			1

prime minister @entity23 forced to *defend* privatisation to mps
share price *soared* by *38* *%* on day of sell - off last *october*
@entity155 accuses ministers of giving *sweetheart* deals to the @entity108
speaker @entity65 slaps down @entity23 and says : ' you have finished '
