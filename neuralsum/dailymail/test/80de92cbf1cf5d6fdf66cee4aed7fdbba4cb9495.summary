the @entity0 will tomorrow inflame the row over a potential @entity4 - @entity3 power - sharing deal by unveiling the party ’s first ‘ manifesto for @entity6 ’			1
the prime minister and the outgoing leader of the @entity10 will launch the @entity12 document , which follows traditional @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity16 manifestos			1
its centrepiece will be a pledge to introduce a system of ‘ @entity12 votes for @entity12 laws ’ – giving @entity12 mps an effective veto over legislation applying only to their constituents			1
inflammatory : prime minister @entity29 ( left ) will be joined by @entity30 ( right ) as they launch the @entity12 manifesto - with the latter expected to warn @entity6 risks being ' held to ransom ' by @entity3 mr @entity30 is expected to warn that @entity6 risks being ‘ held to ransom ’ by @entity36 unless @entity4 agrees to implement such a reform			1
the manifesto is also expected to commit the @entity0 to dozens of new road schemes in @entity6 and an extension of the @entity40 , which pays for expensive cancer treatments on the @entity42			1
the document will be seen as an attempt by the @entity0 to tap into growing @entity12 nationalism			1
opponents are likely to criticise it as risking fostering division between the @entity50 ’s four nations			0
but a @entity52 strategist said : ‘ we have separate @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity16 manifestos			0
why should n’t there be one for @entity6 ? ’ the ‘ @entity12 votes ’ plan would seek to resolve a longstanding constitutional question which will become more urgent than ever once the @entity58 is handed yet more powers			1
mr @entity30 wants to strip @entity13 mps of the power to impose tax changes , education and health reforms on @entity6 , given @entity65 will soon control all these issues in @entity13			1
the reform would make it impossible for any future @entity4 government to press ahead with its plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in @entity6 without winning the support of a majority of @entity12 mps			1
tensions : the manifesto is expected to inflame tensions between the @entity0 and nationalist parties like @entity80 's @entity3 and @entity81 , led by @entity82 it could also make it difficult for a @entity13 mp to again hold the office of chancellor or prime minister , given they would be unable to vote on some of their own @entity90 ’s legislation			1
for decades , @entity4 has relied on the votes of its power base of @entity13 mps to rule @entity95			2
but since the creation of the @entity58 , critics have questioned how it can be right for @entity13 mps to have the crucial say on issues such as tuition fees and foundation hospitals which no longer affect their constituents			2
both reforms passed under @entity107 ’s government thanks to the votes of @entity4 ’s tartan army of @entity99			0
mr @entity30 is expected to say that the scale of devolution now to be given to @entity13 means the question of the status of @entity13 mps at @entity95 is unavoidable			2
' calm smoothness ' : @entity29 has insisted he has ' no end ' of passion in an interview with the spectator @entity29 has admitted that what he called his ‘ calm smoothness ’ could give people the wrong impression about how urgently he wants to win the @entity123			2
in an interview with @entity118 , the prime minister insisted he had ‘ no end ’ of passion but was a conservative , a tribe of ‘ practical , sensible , clear - headed ’ people who ‘ do n’t always wear their beliefs on their sleeve ’			0
asked why many people believe he must do more to demonstrate that he really wants to win , he said : ‘ i do n’t know			0
there is something about me – i always manage to portray a calm smoothness or something			0
‘ but look , yesterday , where was i ? i went to five seats , i did five speeches , i did n’t finish until way after the other party leaders were home having tv training or something			0
' i was out on the stump and i ’m doing the same today			0
look at my schedule ! i do n’t know what more i can do			0
’ mr @entity29 yesterday faced one of his most hostile interviews so far in the campaign			2
@entity152 , a @entity153 newsbeat presenter , repeatedly interrupted him and offered him a £ 1,000 bet that he would not win the election outright			0
clearly irritated , the prime minister said : ‘ have you got some @entity160 - given right to declare what the result of the election is ? ’ he insisted that ‘ there is every opportunity in the next 15 days for there to be a majority government ’ .			0
