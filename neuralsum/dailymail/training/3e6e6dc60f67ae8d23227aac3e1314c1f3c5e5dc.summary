it was a fine example of old - fashioned community spirit			0
but a group of volunteers who got together to rebuild a road fell foul of penpushers – who accused them of health and safety breaches and even trespassing			2
residents of @entity12 on the @entity13 had been campaigning for action ever since homes were left cut off by a landslide in february			1
eight months later nothing had been done , and with eight displaced families still desperate to get back to their homes , a group of ‘ guerrilla ’ volunteers from across the island decided to take matters into their own hands			1
their two - day repair operation involved clearing and filling in a 40ft section of @entity19 , spending £ 2,500 on materials			1
it comes after a similar scheme was hatched by @entity46 , who built his own toll road			0
he spent £ 150,000 on the 400 - yard track through a field , as the @entity50 between @entity51 and @entity52 was fixed after a landslip			0
his local council urged drivers not to use the road , citing health and safety concerns – but they ignored the advice and more than 100,000 have now used it			2

it is a demonstration of people power			0
’ @entity101 last month set aside £ 500,000 for repairs , but did not say when work would start			2
