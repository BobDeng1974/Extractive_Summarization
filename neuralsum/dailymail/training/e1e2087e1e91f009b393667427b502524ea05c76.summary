he won the @entity1 for physics			1
but @entity3 received no special treatment from the @entity5 when he tried to take the 24 - carat pure gold medal through airport security in @entity8 , @entity9			1
he was awarded the prize , made from $ 10,000 of gold , for co-discovering that the expansion of the universe was accelerating - a finding that has transformed our understanding of the solar system			2
as he tried to take it to show his grandmother , however , the revered physicist was stopped and interrogated			2
travel issues : @entity3 , pictured receiving the @entity1 from @entity23 of @entity24 in 2011 , revealed he was interrogated at airport security after taking his gold medal to show his grandma in @entity9 ' it 's a large gold medal ' : the guards were baffled by the gong which went off when @entity3 put his bag through ' there are a couple of bizarre things that happen , ' @entity3 , 47 , told an audience in @entity36 last month			1
' one of the things you get when you win a @entity1 is , well , a @entity1			2
' it 's about that big , that thick [ he mimes a disk roughly the size of an @entity44 medal ] , weighs a half a pound , and it 's made of gold			1
' when i won this , my grandma , who lives in @entity8 , wanted to see it			1
' i was coming around so i decided i 'd bring my @entity1			2
' you would think that carrying around a @entity1 would be uneventful , and it was uneventful , until i tried to leave @entity8 with it , and went through the x-ray machine			1
' i could see they were puzzled			0
it was in my laptop bag			0
it 's made of gold , so it absorbs all the x-rays — it 's completely black			2
and they had never seen anything completely black			0
shock : @entity3 also revealed he was cooking dinner when , without warning , he was called with the news no special treatment : @entity5 security guards ( stock image ) put @entity3 through intensive questioning ' they 're like , " sir , there 's something in your bag			1
" ' i said , " yes , i think it 's this box			0
" ' they said , " what 's in the box ? " ' i said , " a large gold medal , " as one does			1
' so they opened it up and they said , " what 's it made out of ? " ' i said , " gold			2
" ' and they 're like , " uhhhh			0
who gave this to you ? " ' " @entity95 "			0
life - changing : the 47 - year - old physicist co-discovered that the universe 's expansion rate was accelerating ' " why did he give this to you ? " ' ' " because i helped discover the expansion rate of the universe was accelerating			0
" at which point , they were beginning to lose their sense of humor			0
' i explained to them it was a @entity1 , and their main question was , " why were you in @entity8 ? " ' @entity3 , a @entity114 graduate who lectures at the @entity115 , described the encounter as he joined physicists celebrating the construction of one of the largest observatories in the world , the @entity122 ( gmt ) , due to open in 2020 in @entity123			1
he also revealed he was cooking dinner when , without warning , he received a call saying he had won the prize			0

' they just sort of call you up , in my case , in the middle of cooking dinner			0
" hello ? by the way , you ’ve won the @entity1			1

@entity3 won the gold medal @entity1 for physics in 2011
he took it on a plane to show his grandmother in @entity8 , @entity9
security made him explain what the medal was made of and how he got it
