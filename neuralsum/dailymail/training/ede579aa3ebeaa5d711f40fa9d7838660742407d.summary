meditating really is a workout for the mind , according to scientists who have found it can make the brain bigger			0
practising simple meditation techniques such as concentrating on your breathing helps build denser grey matter in parts of the brain associated with learning and memory , controlling emotions and compassion			1
just eight weeks of meditation can produce structural changes large enough to be picked up by @entity19 scanners , @entity15 scientists have discovered			1

it really is mental exercise			0
basically , the idea is “ use it or lose it ”			0
it ’s like building a muscle			0
’ in a study run by @entity38 and her colleagues , 16 volunteers had their brains scanned before and after an eight - week ‘ mindfulness ’ course			1
mindfulness is an increasingly popular form of meditation where the aim is to focus thoughts on the body ’s physical sensations and detach yourself from the ‘ chatter of the mind ’			2
the volunteers had weekly group sessions in which they did breathing exercises , gentle yoga and a ‘ body scan ’ , focusing their thoughts on one part of the body at a time			0
they were also asked to practise for about half an hour each day			0
mri scans were taken before and after the sessions and compared with volunteers who had not taken part in the meditation course			2
in a study , 16 volunteers had their brains scanned before and after an eight - week ‘ mindfulness ’ course after eight weeks , those who went on the course had thicker grey matter in several parts of the brain			1
these included the left hippocampus , a small horseshoe - shaped structure in the central brain involved in memory , learning and emotional regulation			2
other parts ‘ strengthened ’ were the posterior cingulate cortex – again important for memory and emotions ; the temporo - parietal junction , involved in empathising ; and the cerebellum , which helps coordinate movement			2
those who did not go on the course experienced no such structural brain changes			0
dr @entity92 said mental exercise stimulated the neurons that make up grey matter to form denser connections among themselves .			1
