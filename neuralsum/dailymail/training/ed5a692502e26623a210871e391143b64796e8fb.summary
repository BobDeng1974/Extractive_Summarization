a 22 - year - old @entity2 woman 's ear turned black after she was bitten by a @entity4 recluse spider in @entity5 a @entity2 woman ’s ear turned black after she was bitten by a poisonous spider in @entity5			1
part of the 22 - year - old ’s ear was liquefied by the @entity4 recluse spider ’s venom and the skin and cartilage died			1
the woman ’s experience is thought to be the first evidence that recluse spider venom can destroy cartilage			1
the patient ’s health problems began when she woke up with a painful ear one morning , @entity18 reports			0
her ear swelled up so , unaware she had been bitten by a spider , she visited a local hospital where she was given antihistamine			2
despite this treatment , the swelling and pain failed to subside			0
by the time she returned to the @entity2 , part of her ear had turned back indicating the cells had died			2
the woman sought medical help and doctors realised she had been bitten by a @entity4 recluse spider as the creature ’s venom is known to kill skin			1
however , dr @entity38 , a plastic surgeon involved in the patient ’s care , explained this was the first time doctors had seen the spiders ’ venom destroy cartilage as well as skin			1
the spiders ’ venom kills cells using a complex mixture of chemicals which break down proteins and there is no drug treatment that is known to be effective			0
as a result , dr @entity54 and her colleagues were forced to remove the dead tissue from the woman ’s ear and then rebuild it using cartilage from her ribs			2
the @entity4 recluse spider originated in the @entity4 region of @entity63 and @entity64 but it is now widely distributed			1
it has poisonous venom but is thought only to bite when forced into contact with people - for example , if trapped in clothes or bedding			0
in rare cases , the spiders ’ bites can be fatal as they can cause kidney failure			0
the spider 's venom liquefied part of the woman 's ear and caused some of the skin and cartilage to die			2
the dead tissue had to be cut away ( left ) and then the ear had to be rebuilt using cartilage from her ribs ( right ) normally , bites cause a red patch to develop on the skin which leaves a slow - healing , open wound and exposed muscle			1
it can take up to two months for the wound to heal and it often leaves a sunken scar			0
dr @entity54 told @entity18 that the spiders are ‘ not that dangerous ’ and that she ‘ would n’t take precautions ’ to avoid a bite			0
the case was reported in the @entity98 .			0

the @entity2 woman , 22 , was bitten by a @entity4 recluse spider in @entity5
part of her ear was liquefied by the venom and the skin and cartilage died
this is the first evidence the spiders ' venom can destroy cartilage
the dead tissue had to be cut away before her ear could be rebuilt
