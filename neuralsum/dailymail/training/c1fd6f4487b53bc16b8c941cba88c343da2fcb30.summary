whales may be known for having large appetites , but one humpback nearly bit off more than it could chew off the coast of @entity4 after almost swallowing a pelican			1
the bizarre scene was captured by photographer @entity7 in @entity8 as she watched a gathering of birds , sea lions and whales feasting on a school of anchovies			0
while the pelican appeared to be doomed after becoming trapped in the whale 's mouth , the creature opened its jaws again just before diving , allowing the bird to flap its way to freedom			1
luckily for the pelican the whale opened its jaws just before diving , allowing the bird to flap to freedom anchovies , like sardine or herring , swim in huge schools which move as one body , and are covered in silvery scales to help confuse predators as they dart about to avoid being eaten			1
when attacked from all sides by predatory fish or sea lions , the instinct to stick together becomes a weakness , trapping the fish in so - called ' bait balls ' which are also targeted by birds as they rise towards the surface			0
whales make their hunt easier by waiting for these densely - packed balls to form , before rising up from underneath to swallow them whole with one huge gulp			0
however , as so many other animals crowd around trying to get a piece of the action , it is not uncommon for them to also become fish food			0
ms @entity7 , who took the pictures for @entity59 , said : ' this particular pelican 's timing was a bit off and did n't lift off fast enough before the humpback whales emerged			0
ms @entity7 said that whales have a large pink organ on the top of their mouths , which can be mistake for a tongue , which is used to sense how much food has gone into their mouths - and probably alerted the whale to the fact that the bird was stuck whales often wait for schools of anchovies to be herded into ' bait balls ' by other predators before striking from below , swallowing the densley - packed fish in one go			0
because these balls attract many other animals , it is not uncommon for them to be caught in the beast 's jaws ' the humpback did n't close its mouth all the way			1
it 's very likely the whale felt the pelican in its mouth and did n't want to crush it			1
' we watched as the whale opened its mouth wide before submerging again and the pelican hopped across the water with no visible damage			2
she added : ' humpback whales have a special organ on the roof of their mouth - a long , pink strip that 's often confused for the whale 's tongue			2
' it 's very sensitive and is likely used to get a feel for how much food the whale is taking in with one mouthful , though they could also use it to detect something inside their mouth that did n't belong there - like a pelican			2

humpback whale was hunting for anchovies in @entity4 when it accidentally caught a pelican in its huge jaws
bird pictured with only its beak and wing *poking* out of animal 's mouth after failing to take off *quickly* enough
however just before whale dived under the waves it opened its mouth again allowing the bird to free itself
