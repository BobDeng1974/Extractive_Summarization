another day , another debut at the @entity1 , this time for midfielder @entity2			1
but what 's the story on @entity6 's latest youth - team star made good ? he 's only 19 but @entity6 have already tied him down until 2017			1
that tells you how highly they rate him			0
he 's been at the club since he was six and , judging from wednesday night 's first senior game , he is going to be around for a long time - and not be snatched by @entity13 ! well that is the concern that has made the club make sure his contract is in order			2
coach @entity19 has shown even more willingness to blood youngsters than @entity22 did and he is a big @entity23 fan so there is no chance of a move to @entity27 , or @entity28 for that matter – @entity30 was keen when he was still at @entity31			2
@entity2 impressed for @entity6 in the @entity32 on wednesday evening what sort of player is he ? on wednesday he played in @entity35 holding midfield position			1
his strength is in keeping possession but not at the expense of moving the ball forward purposefully			0
his touch and weight of pass – honed during those 13 years at the club - are what really make him stand out			0
he also sniffs out danger , anticipating the runs and passes of the opposition , proving you do n't have to be physically imposing to play the position as long as you are clever			0
@entity2 has been compared to @entity35 and will challenge him for a first - team place is he in the team for good now ? no. he will lead the @entity55 team in @entity57 's second division this season and only make a handful of appearances in the first team			1
but next season – and remembering that @entity6 can not make signings for one year – he will step up to the seniors and compete with @entity65 for that central midfield berth			1
@entity2 has impressed for @entity68 's b team in recent seasons @entity2 has impressed with his reading of the game and his passing ability but his debut went well ? he brought the house down with one steal , pirouette and pass all in one movement			1
he admitted post match : ' when i saw i was starting i got nervous but i soon calmed down and @entity79 and @entity19 told me just to play as always have done in the youth teams			0
' starting out at @entity6 at six – that really must be a record ? as has been pointed out it takes the term ' one - club man ' to new levels			2
@entity6 usually scour @entity87 and the rest of @entity57 for the best young talent but @entity2 has been one of theirs from the beginning			1
he 's a symbol of what 's healthy about their youth system			0
they 'll be keen for people to remember that as they take their appeal over that transfer ban for breaking @entity102 rules on signing under - 18s to the @entity98			0
seems like a transfer ban would n't actually hurt them a great deal if this is what they have coming through ? that 's what some of their supporters are saying : more @entity111 and less 17m euro @entity112 .			0

@entity2 impressed during @entity6 's 1 - 0 *win* over @entity115
midfielder has been at the @entity1 since he was six years old
he is *expected* to challenge @entity65 for a first - team place next season
manager @entity19 is an admirer of the central midfielder
