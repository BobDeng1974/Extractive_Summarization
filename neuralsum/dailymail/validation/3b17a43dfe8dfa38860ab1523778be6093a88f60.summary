it is almost a full month now since the despised old regime at @entity2 was routed in the battle for control of @entity5			1
but the influence of ex-chief executive @entity7 continues to be felt in the @entity8 as the new board of directors stumble across a series of strategically - placed landmines			0
one particularly nasty surprise exploded into the public domain on tuesday as it emerged the price of promotion to the @entity17 for @entity2 will include an extra £ 500,000 payable to @entity18			1
@entity19 owner @entity18 will be laughing all the way to the bank if @entity2 win promotion @entity18 will receive payment for the loan of five @entity19 players including @entity26 ( centre ) , @entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 that sizeable sum is in return for @entity18 loaning the @entity5 club five of his @entity19 players ; four of whom turned out to be either injured , ill or unfit			1
of course , the long - suffering @entity2 fans have grown wearily accustomed to their club being treated with contempt while ruthless businessman @entity18 lines his pockets			1
the support have witnessed the @entity19 owner ’s placemen sell the naming rights to their beloved @entity5 for just £ 1 – albeit @entity18 subsequently gave up those rights amid a backlash from the rank and file			1
they then watched in disbelief as a deal was sanctioned with the billionaire ’s @entity50 firm that sees just 75 pence of every £ 10 spent on @entity2 merchandise going to the club			1
but tuesday 's revelation in the club ’s latest accounts is perhaps the most depressing example of the callous regard in which the outgoing board viewed the @entity5 club			1
in a scenario that ’s being viewed at @entity2 as ‘ vindictive , it ’s believed that @entity2 ’ own medical staff were overruled by @entity7 when they insisted on medicals for the five loan @entity2			2
had that happened , @entity2 would have found @entity29 and @entity66 were in no state to play while @entity68 was patently unfit			1
@entity29 duly limped off 45 minutes into his debut after @entity7 had ordered caretaker manager @entity70 to start him			0
proper testing would also have shown that @entity28 was ill , with a condition that had already been diagnosed by medics at @entity19			1
@entity26 has been the only player loaned from @entity19 that has been a success at @entity5 20 - year - old defender @entity29 suffered an injury in his one and only first - team appearance for @entity2 of the five loan @entity2 , midfielder @entity26 has been the sole success - but campaigning @entity2 fan @entity80 says the situation jars when he recalls the sale of star player @entity83 to @entity84 in january			1
‘ that was done on the pretext they were protecting the future of @entity2 , ’ said @entity80 of the @entity86 supporters group			2
‘ but i believe they only got £ 250,000 for @entity83 and then they shell out £ 500,000 for five loan players			1
‘ @entity83 would add more to the team than @entity26			2
and i would rather have @entity83 at @entity5 on a permanent basis – increasing his value – than all five @entity19 loan players , even if they were all fit			1
’ new @entity2 chairman @entity99 recently held up the decision by @entity7 and his then finance director , the @entity50 executive @entity102 , to spend £ 300,000 on an @entity103 - when it was clear the old board was finished – as examples of the financial madness that has plagued @entity2 since liquidation			2
and yet another landmine was stumbled upon as it emerged auditors @entity111 had informed the previous board of their intention to resign last june			0
defensive midfielder @entity28 has been ruled out of action for @entity2 with a mystery illness not only did the previous board fail to announce this , or seek a replacement , they inexplicably included the reappointment of @entity111 on their resolution notice in november for the following month ’s agm			1
‘ it ’s just another example of the deplorable mismanagement at @entity2 , or of people burying their heads in the sand , ’ said @entity80			0
‘ the resolution was passed in december but @entity111 were long gone as auditors			0
’ as @entity2 revealed losses after tax of £ 2.89million for the six - month period to 31 december 2014 , the accounts reiterated two @entity133 warnings outlined in full - year accounts signed off by @entity111 relating to the company ’s ability to trade as a going concern			2
but new chairman @entity99 confirmed @entity139 ’s exclusive that the club is planning a rights issue in the summer to raise funds - believed to be £ 10m – to sustain the club in the medium and long term			0
in his statement , @entity99 said the club would become ‘ self - sustaining ’ and ‘ free from the kind of funding crises that have plagued @entity2 in recent years			2
’ he vowed that , under the new board , the @entity5 club would be back competing at the top level at home and in @entity154 by 2022 - in time for the 50th anniversary of the club ’s 1972 @entity158 triumph in @entity159			1
@entity160 is a ' strong candidate ' to extend his position as @entity2 boss beyond the end of the season describing interim boss @entity160 as a ‘ strong candidate ’ for the permanent position , @entity99 called on fans to back his board by investing in season tickets			0
he said : ‘ the vision is to focus on the next seven years so that by 2022 , the club ’s 150th anniversary and the 50th anniversary of @entity159 , we , @entity2 , will be back at the very top			2
‘ over the next few years the finance we are putting in place now will provide the infrastructure and personnel at @entity180 to make sure @entity2 are competing and winning in @entity182 ’s top flight as well as stepping back into the @entity154 arenas again			0
‘ then for the three or four years after that all our efforts will be directed towards making @entity2 stronger and @entity154 regulars as our 150th year approaches			0
that year should be one of celebration			0
‘ a massive rebuild is required at every level and in every department of this huge club of ours and we can not and will not shy away from those tasks			0
‘ after years of mismanagement we need patience and support			0
we must never forget what has happened to our club in the last four years			0
the new board will ensure that it never happens again			0
this is our club , we have taken ownership of it and with our 2022 vision we will not fail			0

@entity18 will receive £ 500,000 if @entity2 are promoted to @entity17
the *fee* is payment for the loan of five @entity19 players to the @entity5 club
@entity212 , @entity66 were and @entity68 were unfit , @entity28 was ill and only @entity26 has been a success
