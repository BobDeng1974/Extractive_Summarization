by @entity0 published : 20:09 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 20:10 est , 21 february 2013 illegal : some of @entity3 's plans for press regulation breach @entity5 human rights laws , accroding to top lawyers a key plank of @entity3 ’s plans for press regulation breaches @entity5 human rights laws , leading barristers have warned			1
the joint opinion by three qcs concludes the judge ’s proposal to punish newspapers that refuse to join a new press regulator with exemplary damages would violate @entity20 , which protects freedom of expression			1
@entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 found that the proposals would have a ‘ chilling effect ’ on free speech which was ‘ obvious and unjustifiable ’			1
the breach is so ‘ striking ’ ministers would be unable to sign off legislation that incorporates the proposal as being compatible with human rights laws , the qcs say			1
@entity3 recommended the threat of exemplary damages as a way of providing an incentive for newspapers to voluntarily come within the remit of the new regulator			1
the proposal is included in a draft bill published by the @entity43 and is taken even further in controversial plans for an arbitration system that have recently been inserted into the @entity46 by the @entity48 peer @entity47			0
the new opinion , which was commissioned by the newspaper industry , warns the proposals are ‘ objectionable in principle due to their arbitrary extension of what is widely regarded as an anomalous feature of @entity58 law ’			2
it also said the proposals single out a particular category of defendant rather than a particular kind of conduct			0
‘ to punish the @entity65 for what others may do without punishment is inconsistent with the special importance that domestic and @entity71 jurisprudence attach to @entity72 , ’ the lawyers said			2
their opinion was challenged by @entity74 , chairman of the @entity76 campaign , who said it was ‘ misconceived ’			0
conflicting views : @entity74 , left , chairman of the hacked off campaign , said the lawyers ' warning is ' misconceived ' , while @entity82 , right , believes that changing defamation laws would curb the @entity65 in a way ' never seen in any democratic country ' the revelation came as ministers brace themselves for a showdown with peers over the @entity91 amendment to the @entity46			2
the amendment introduces a @entity3 - style arbitration backed by law			1
but , in a further controversial step , it also threatens ruinous damages against papers that fail to get prior approval for publishing contentious stories			0
the eminent @entity100 , architect of the @entity46 which is designed to reform @entity102 ’s notorious libel laws , said the @entity104 proposals would curb the @entity65 in a way ‘ never seen in any democratic country ’			0
@entity107 has made it clear that the prime minister will not allow the @entity104 proposal to become law , even if it means the entire @entity46 has to be scrapped to prevent it .			0

top lawyers say regulations would be ' unjustifiable ' and law breach ' obvious '
