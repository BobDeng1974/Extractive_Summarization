by @entity0 last updated at 2:14 pm on 4th january 2012 police are hoping @entity3 will agree to become a ‘ supergrass ’ and testify against fellow , un-convicted , @entity3 gang members , the @entity1 can reveal			1
detectives believe @entity3 – long regarded as one of the ‘ weak links ’ in the mob – might seek a deal with prosecutors and finally come clean about who else was responsible for @entity0 ’s death			1
both @entity3 and @entity3 were named by the @entity1 in 1997 as @entity0 ’s killers , along with @entity16 and @entity17 and @entity18			1
detectives believe @entity3 ( right ) might seek a deal with prosecutors and finally come clean about who else was responsible for @entity3 's ( left ) death the five have never sued and last night @entity25 filmed the @entity17 brothers still refusing even to discuss the case			1
details of the circumstances in which convicts can receive a reduced prison sentence , in return for co-operating with the authorities , are spelt out in the @entity34			0
police believe they have exhausted all opportunities to gather new forensic evidence in the @entity3 case , meaning their best chance of nailing the other gang members is if a new witness were to come forward – or @entity3 were to become a supergrass			1
acting deputy commissioner @entity43 insisted the @entity44 was still not at ' the end of the road ' in the search for the remaining killers it is understood the possibility of @entity3 co-operating has already been discussed informally by investigators			2
last night the @entity44 ’s acting deputy commissioner @entity43 said police would continue working to bring the rest of @entity0 ’s killers to justice			1
detectives have a list of seven remaining suspects for the murder			2
their most recent investigation , which coincided with a review of the original forensic evidence , whittled down 187 names of interest to just nine			0
the convictions of @entity3 and @entity3 leave seven still in the frame , including the @entity67 and @entity18			1
and the @entity1 can also reveal that detectives : @entity3 is regarded by detectives as an ‘ old - school villain ’ who would never snitch			1
but father - of - two @entity3 , whose girlfriend @entity74 was blowing kisses to him from the public gallery during the trial , is seen as someone who might be willing to lift the lid on the identities of the other killers			1
police are still not certain which member of the gang stabbed @entity0 at this bus stop in @entity86 , south east @entity87 , pictured because he pleaded not guilty at the murder trial , @entity3 would have to come up with compelling new evidence , which can be corroborated , for him to have any chance of a sentence reduction			1
@entity3 , pictured , is regarded by detectives as an ' old - school villain ' who would never snitch a well - placed source said : ‘ police would be happy to talk to @entity3			1
i ca n’t imagine he will be too happy knowing that the @entity67 and @entity18 are swanning around @entity86 , while he is locked up in jail doing a long stretch			0
’ the source added : ‘ @entity3 is now a convicted murderer , and by definition ( because of his previous stance in this case ) , is also a convicted liar			2
but there are opportunities under @entity34 for him to receive a lower sentence if he agrees to become a prosecution witness			0
‘ the police are not allowed to offer him an inducement up front , merely point out the existence of the legislation			2
he could have several years taken off his sentence if he co-operates			2
’ acting deputy commissioner @entity43 insisted the @entity44 was still not at ‘ the end of the road ’ in the search for the remaining killers			0
she said : ‘ if we get new evidence , if we have further opportunities , we will respond to that			0
‘ and no doubt in the future the case will be reviewed , as other murders are if they are unresolved			0
we do n’t see this as the end of the road			0
’ former detective superintendent @entity129 , who recently retired , said she thought there was a chance that the remaining killers could be brought to justice			0
‘ i ’m always hopeful because there have been quite a number of cases over the years from forensic advancements , ’ she said			0
‘ the changing allegiance of people who are related to a number of cases , and new information that is reported to us			0
‘ so as a detective officer involved in a number of cases that are solved many , many years after they first occur , of course i ’m hopeful			0
’ an extraordinary outburst from media commentator @entity149 almost ended the trial of @entity3 ’s killers before it began			1
in breach of a strict court order , he wrote a provocative comment piece which risked prejudicing the trial of @entity3 and @entity3			2
in the article , published in @entity156 three days after the trial started , @entity149 wrote : ‘ should we care about these undoubtedly violent , often criminal , certainly unpleasant white trash ? that they were ( and probably still are ) racists is quite beyond dispute			0
’ he also included details not known to the jurors concerning @entity3 ’s previous convictions			1
the matter was referred to the attorney general for contempt of court , and @entity149 and @entity156 could face criminal charges .			0

detectives think @entity3 is one of the ' weak links ' in the mob
they think @entity3 is an ' old school ' criminal who wo *n't* snitch
believe a sixth man , possibly blond , may have been in the killer mob . efforts to identify the suspect could feature in any fresh police probe *launched* as a result of the murder convictions .
are still not certain which member of the gang stabbed @entity0 .
may seek to charge @entity3 ’s father @entity0 with *perverting* the course of justice , for allegedly providing him with a false alibi . he was arrested over lying to police ten years *ago* , but not prosecuted .
