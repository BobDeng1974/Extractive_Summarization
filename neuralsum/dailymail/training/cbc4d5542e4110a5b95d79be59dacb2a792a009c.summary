mystery has long surrounded his final resting place - but recent renovations of the mausoleum uncovered a brick chamber under granite floor slabs , in which human remains were found			1

incredible find : the excavation of a mausoleum in the grounds of @entity2 in @entity4 is thought to have uncovered the body of sir @entity0 , who died 300 years ago in 1713 mausoleum : @entity49 has been restoring @entity2 in @entity4 with his family after inheriting it in 2007 ‘ it is a very exciting find , ’ the two men said in a statement			1
‘ the discovery of this body in the vault contradicts local tradition and adds another twist to the eccentric goings on of the @entity49 family			0
’ @entity49 , who has been restoring the castle with his family after inheriting it in 2007 , was at the opening of the vault after spending five years researching sir @entity0 ’s life and the estate			1
sir @entity0 was born in november 1645 and is described on the castle ’s website as ‘ an extraordinary man of dubious character ’			2
from humble origins he emerged to be the land agent of a sir @entity74 , who owned a large estate called @entity76 that bounded the area on which @entity2 was built			2
but when sir @entity74 died unexpectedly aged 42 , sir @entity0 soon married his widow @entity79			1
there had been suggestions that they had been seeing each other before sir @entity74 ’s death – and even that sir @entity74 was poisoned			0
the marriage made sir @entity0 ’s rich and he was knighted by @entity85 after giving him a ‘ great sum of money ’			2

‘ there is no doubt these are very old remains , and all indications are that it is likely to be sir @entity0			2
there was no sign of his pipe , books or wine but there was the remains of a chair that looks typical to the 1700 's when he would have been placed there			0
‘ despite all the theories that we had banded about as we tackled the restoration of the mausoleum - the strange bricked in windows , the false ceiling joists , the inverted v - shaped roof , the steps that seem barely connected to the main structure - this was certainly not on the list			0
he added : ‘ there are no plans to exhume the body or to undergo any further dna tests			0
' the public will be able to view @entity2 's gardens over the coming months , but will not be able to visit the mausoleum .			0
