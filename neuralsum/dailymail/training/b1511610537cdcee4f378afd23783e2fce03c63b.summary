mrs @entity11 , 43 , described how her family tried to get out of the car , but rangers at the park told them to stay put for ' safety reasons '			1
she said : ‘ being good friday it was busy and we had to keep stopping and starting the car			1
everything was fine until we got into the lion enclosure			2
seconds after they abandoned the vehicle it burst into flames the mother and her two children were on a tour of the park when the 4x4 overheated and smoke started pouring from the engine			1
it burst into flames in the middle of the lion enclosure – which is home to 12 lions horrified family : ( from left to right ) @entity64 , nine , @entity11 , 43 , and @entity65 , 12 , who were faced with a life - or - death decision in the lion enclosure ‘ the car just stopped and started to overheat			1
what i thought was steam started coming from the bonnet then it got darker and turned into smoke through the vent and towards us			0
‘ i knew the lions were only 100 yards away and i just did n’t know what to do – should we get out of the car or should we stay ? i sounded the horn and could see some park rangers but i kept an eye on the bonnet and then i saw the flames			1
’ mrs @entity11 , who is an assistant in her village shop in @entity85 , @entity86 , continued : ‘ the kids were panicking and there were a lot of tears			0
‘ @entity14 was in the back and opened the door and got out of the car but a ranger shouted , “ get back in			1
” siblings : @entity65 , 12 , and younger brother @entity14 , 9 , were in the car when it set on fire terrifying : @entity11 , 43 , spoke say park rangers initially told her family to stay in the vehicle for ' safety reasons ' ‘ i shouted back that we ca n’t – it ’s on fire – and opened the driver ’s door and started to get out and at that moment the rangers pulled up and we all jumped in with them			1
‘ the rangers had to keep the lions out of the way			2
' people who saw it happening said the lions knew something was happening and were intrigued but fortunately did n’t come too close			2
' it all happened so quickly it ’s difficult to recall exactly what happened , but the children soon calmed down and they ’ve now got a wonderful story to tell all their school chums			0
a spokesman for @entity10 said the trio were transferred to a ranger 's vehicle and the park was temporarily closed while firefighters extinguished the blaze the lions were cleared from the enclosure and the safari park was closed while firefighters tackled the blazing vehicle they were forced to abandon the smoking vehicle and had no option but to flee to the lion enclosure , which is home to 12 adult lions ‘ it could have been a lot worse			1
my daughter was mainly upset that she ’d left her phone in the car			2
’ fire crews from @entity145 put out the flames within 15 minutes			2
watch manager @entity147 said : ‘ when we arrived the car was well alight			0
‘ our main concern was being able to get to the car safely while inside a lion enclosure			2
’ a spokesman for @entity10 said : ‘ on friday at around 1pm a car overheated in the first lion enclosure at @entity42			1
‘ the lions were cleared from the enclosure and the safari park was closed			1
no one was injured in any way and no lions were hurt			0
‘ the vehicle has been safely removed and the safari park has fully re-opened to visitors			0
’ the family were forced to escape into the lion enclosure after their 4x4 burst into flames while they were on a tour of the park in @entity18 on friday @entity173 , who was in the queue with his family waiting to get into the enclosure told @entity177 : ' we wondered what was going on , looked across and saw at first what looked like steam , so we assumed that the car had just overheated			1
' then we saw the steam getting thicker and turning to smoke			0
that 's when we realised something was wrong			0
' we could n't really tell from the distance we were , but the mother and two children looked distraught			0
' the passenger door opened twice as the rangers turned up , but they told them to close the door			0
' however a ranger vehicle pulled up close by very quickly and took everybody to safety			0
' none of the surrounding cars tried to help , i suppose they were worried about the lions			0
if we had been closer , we would have tried to get them all into our car			0
' i know it would 've been breaking every rule and sign , but it 's better to get people to safety first			0
' we could n't actually see where the lions were , the first we saw was one of them going to their secure holding pen to the left ( behind ) us , looking a little scared and bemused , especially the adolescent male			0
our children were panicking , and we did n't know if the car was going to explode and hurt people nearby			0
' we felt worried for the family , with the car on fire and lions in the vicinity			1
' park rangers managed to clear all of the lions from the enclosure to ensure they were not injured in the blaze			2
