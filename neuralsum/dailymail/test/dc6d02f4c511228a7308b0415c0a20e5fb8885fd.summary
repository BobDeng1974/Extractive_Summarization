the seeds of the @entity2 furore were planted during an otherwise unremarkable match between @entity4 and @entity5 in the early weeks of 2013			1
@entity7 striker @entity6 caught @entity9 defender @entity8 high on his right shin in a dangerous challenge			1
referee @entity12 saw an incident , but not the gory details			1
the official had his view obstructed by bodies and because of that the @entity18 could take no action			1
the governing body immediately took the stance they * should * be allowed to use video evidence to review incidents the referee had clearly missed			1
rules over use of video evidence to retrospectively ban players changed after this challenge by @entity6 ( right ) on @entity8 @entity34 chief executive @entity33 disagreed , telling them so			1
and on thursday night he renewed his call for member clubs to put the genie back in the bottle amidst widespread unease at the fact @entity2 might have missed a @entity42 because a referee and his assistants failed to see a handball in last sunday ’s semi-final victory over @entity47			1
retrospective action , believes the @entity50 players ’ union , has become too far reaching			1
its tentacles now stretch to an uncomfortable distance			2
‘ the referee had a clear view of it but could n’t see the actual contact because of the two players ’ bodies , ’ said @entity33 of the critical @entity6 and @entity56 incident two years ago			1
‘ when the @entity18 told us they were considering changing the regulation to allow the use of video evidence , we were strongly against it			2
‘ under the rules , they could n’t charge @entity6 because the referee was the wrong side of the incident			1
they moved to change that			2
‘ but as has been proven with @entity2 , it was opening a whole can of worms as you are effectively re-refereeing the games			1
@entity79 defender @entity2 clearly used his hand to stop the ball in the @entity42 semi-final ‘ we warned this was too far and it would cause problems			1
’ @entity33 takes no pleasure in being vindicated by the decision of the independent appeal panel which lifted a one - game suspension on @entity79 player @entity2 on thursday			1
under the existing rules , @entity18 compliance officer @entity90 was within his rights to charge the player			1
he had denied @entity47 a goalscoring opportunity with his hand			0
the officials had missed it and , reviewing the video evidence , the governing body believed it was a red - card offence punishable retrospectively			2
echoing the views of @entity100 vice president @entity99 and others , however , @entity33 believes the rules have gone too far			1
that the authority of referees is now being undermined for matters it should n’t be			0
‘ the purpose of video evidence is not to catch minor things , ’ he continued			0
‘ no player has a problem with anyone getting caught giving a fly punch or kick off the ball			0
they know they deserve it			0
‘ i know the referees are not happy with this because @entity120 is being examined after the game			0
‘ he made a mistake - but does he deserve the continued fall - out from that ? i do n’t think referees , players or fans want it			0
now @entity100 do n’t want it , either			0
‘ we have moved now towards re-refereeing the game			0
@entity120 did have a view of the incident on sunday , even if he did n’t see the handball			1
‘ if something happens behind a referee ’s back – a fly kick – that ’s not re-refereeing it because the referee genuinely does n’t see it			2
‘ but when referees have a view of it it ’s different			0
‘ @entity120 was in the ideal position to see it			0
‘ the rule was brought in primarily for things that happen behind the referee ’s back - but he and @entity152 had a view of this			2
‘ their vision might have been blocked - but there are angles where they are looking at it with no players between them			0
‘ the fact is that we all make mistakes and funnily enough the biggest supporter for the referee in all of this will be the players			2
‘ they will be annoyed , they will be angry			0
players know what it ’s like to make a mistake			0
@entity2 has been cleared to play after @entity18 had banned him after deeming the hand ball a red card offence ‘ it ’s a major mistake and that should be dealt with in terms of referee ’s observer and their markings			1
but you ca n’t re-referee a game			0
‘ we react to one incident - and what happened here was a reaction to @entity6			1
‘ the immediate reaction is to change the rules so it ca n’t happen again			2
‘ but we ca n’t just be reacting to one single incident – it has to be wider than that			2
‘ no one has a problem with penalising violent conduct			0
the @entity18 have to listen to everyone within the game			0
’ @entity33 ’s issues with events on sunday extend beyond the @entity2 scenario			1
@entity79 defender @entity203 missed last year ’s @entity204 after contracting two bookings en route			2
agonisingly , he suffered the same fate at @entity208 last weekend			0
in contrast with @entity2 , he * will * miss another final against @entity211 under the punitive two strikes rule			1
‘ there is an element of fairness when it comes to being banned from cup finals , as well , ’ added @entity33			0
‘ does @entity203 deserve to miss out due to two bookings ? ‘ if you ’re sent off for violent conduct it ’s different , but it ’s a once in a lifetime opportunity and for a player to miss it due to two yellows or a soft red seems like injustice to me			0
it needs to be looked at			0
