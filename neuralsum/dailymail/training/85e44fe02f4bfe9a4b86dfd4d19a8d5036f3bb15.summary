@entity1 told @entity41 : ' i played quite well , birdied the par - fives i needed to birdie , which is ante in this format because birdies are so much better than bogeys are bad			2
' it 's definitely a format that rewards the guy that makes a lot of birdies			0
so i put some points on the board , which you have to , because there were some low ones this morning , it looked like - or some high ones , however you want to put it			2
