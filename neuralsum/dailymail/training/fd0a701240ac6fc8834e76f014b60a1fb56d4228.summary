a stunning display of the @entity1 has been seen in @entity2 with the dancing colours visible to the naked eye			2
the beautiful spectacle was seen in the early hours of @entity6 , as colours of green and pink appeared in the sky			0
known as the @entity12 , the natural wonder is caused by charged particles colliding in the @entity15 ’s atmosphere			1
in this image , an @entity22 is seen on the horizon behind @entity25 in @entity2 @entity28 photographers @entity26 and @entity29 braved the cold to capture the display , that could be seen near @entity33 lighthouse , in @entity2			1
it is believed the light show , which was also captured across @entity36 , was caused by a strong solar storm which began on december 20th			1
@entity22 are one effect of energetic particles which can speed out from the sun both in a steady stream called the solar wind and due to giant eruptions known as coronal mass ejections , or @entity45			2
after a trip toward @entity15 that can last two to three days , the solar particles and magnetic fields cause the release of particles already trapped near @entity15			2
breathtaking : at five minutes past midnight on christmas eve the lights of the @entity12 created a beautiful display of colours in the night sky above @entity36 festive glow : an @entity22 is seen on the horizon in @entity2			2
it is believed a solar storm on december 20th caused the light show clear skies : @entity22 are one effect of energetic particles , which can speed out from the sun both in a steady stream called the solar wind and due to giant eruptions known as coronal mass ejections , or @entity68 it is believed the @entity6 light show was caused by a strong solar storm which began on december 20th			1
the solar flare registered as an @entity74 event - one of the most powerful types of flares possible			2
the solar flare also caused a radio blackout for parts of @entity15 over the weekend , according to an alert from the @entity81 @entity80			1
aurora are created when energetic particles from a solar flare trigger reactions in the upper atmosphere of @entity15			1
this in turn trigger reactions in the upper atmosphere in which oxygen and nitrogen molecules are released a particles of light			0
the strong solar flare which created this aurora triggered a radio blackout for parts of @entity15 over the weekend , according to an alert from the @entity81 @entity80			1
usually the best spots to see the lights are those places close to the @entity101 , such as @entity102 and @entity103			0
in the southern hemisphere , they are known as the @entity106 and can often be mirror - like images that occur at the same time as in the north			0
@entity110 winter nights tend to be better for observing the sky due to less haze and water vapour in the air			0
the colour of the aurora depends on which gas - oxygen or nitrogen - is being generated by the electrons			0
it also depends on how fast the electrons are moving			0
as well as @entity15 , any planet with a magnetic  eld and an atmosphere should have auroras , including @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity127			0
lucky shot : @entity110 winter nights tend to be better for observing the sky due to less haze and water vapour in the air			0
usually the best spots to see the lights are those places close to the @entity101 , such as @entity102 and @entity103 braving the cold : @entity28 photographers @entity26 and @entity29 captured the display in the early hours of this morning			1

photographers @entity26 and @entity29 braved the cold to capture the display near @entity33 lighthouse
natural wonder is believed to have been caused by a huge solar storm that erupted on the sun on december 20
solar flare caused charged particles to collide with @entity15 *'s* atmosphere , which in turn created stunning colours
