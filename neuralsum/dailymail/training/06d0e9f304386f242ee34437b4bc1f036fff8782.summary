with its ban on alcohol and rules ordering women to cover up , it is not the most obvious summer holiday destination			2
but that has not stopped @entity8 from experiencing a surge in tourism from the @entity11 , with bookings at travel agencies up by as much as 400 per cent			1
for years , the hardline regime of anti-western former president @entity15 put off all but the most adventurous travellers			1
but the arrival of football - loving @entity18 as his successor last year appears to have made the @entity22 country seem friendlier			1
@entity23 in @entity24 in @entity8 - which is now becoming a tourist hotspot , according to travel agents @entity27 , managing director of @entity28 , which has been organising trips to @entity8 for ten years , hopes to send up to 150 customers this year , compared with a few dozen in 2013			1
mr @entity27 said : ‘ with the new man in charge and the easing of relations , a lot more people feel safe to go there			2
’ in the @entity15 years , mr @entity27 said his company would provide just one or two organised tours for up to 12 people at a time , and arrange ‘ a handful ’ of trips for individuals or couples			1
‘ things have changed completely this year , ’ he said			2
‘ in 2012 , it was hard to sell @entity8 at all and in 2013 we had just two group tours running			0
this year we are running nine			0
‘ we are also providing tailor - made trips for dozens more people			1
in total , we are approaching 150 bookings so far in 2014			0
’ @entity28 ’ group tours cost £ 2,795 per person for a fortnight or £ 1,995 for 10 days , taking in ancient fortresses , mosques , bazaars , royal gardens and @entity8 ’s @entity61 in @entity62 , which displays its crown jewels and peacock throne			0
there are no direct flights from the @entity11 to @entity8 so travellers have to change in either @entity68 or @entity69			1
mr @entity27 said : ‘ travel to @entity8 has never been a problem in the years we ’ve been running tours			1
as long as people going there are sensible , we have partners in @entity8 who know what they are doing and our customers are well looked - after			0
’ the arrival of football - loving @entity18 last year appears to have made the @entity22 country seem friendlier ‘ the issue has always been the way @entity8 has been perceived			1
under @entity15 this was a particular problem , especially with the attack on the @entity89 in @entity62 in 2011 but with the new man in charge and the easing of relations , a lot more people feel safe to go there			1
’ @entity94 , marketing executive at @entity96 - based @entity95 , which also organises tours of the country , said : ‘ since january we have had the same number of bookings that we had in the whole of 2013			2
’ @entity102 , marketing manager at @entity28 , based in @entity103 , south @entity104 , has just returned from one of the company ’s tours to @entity8 and describes the country as ‘ amazing ’			2
he said : ‘ it was a really interesting place , full of history , amazing architecture and mosques			0
‘ probably the biggest surprise was how friendly and welcoming the people were - everywhere we went we were surrounded by people wanting to ask us questions about topics ranging from politics to the @entity119			0
‘ the officials were very low - key and although they probably knew where we were , there was n’t any visible presence monitoring our movements			0
’ among the hotels mr @entity102 stayed in was the 300 - year - old @entity126 , @entity127 , a one - time favourite of the @entity128 prior to the 1979 @entity130 revolution			0
he said : ‘ the hotels were all clean and comfortable but there was an atmosphere faded grandeur , which is a symptom of the economic sanctions and @entity8 having been off the tourist map for so long			0
‘ there were very few @entity138 but we met a few @entity139 and @entity140			0
’ but despite the friendly welcome , mr @entity102 said alcohol remains banned , women have to disguise their body shape and wear scarves and , while men are permitted western clothing , shorts are not allowed			2
other down - sides include @entity151 credit or debit cards not working in @entity8 , so tourists need to bring cash to exchange			0
@entity28 ’ brochure describes ‘ fascinating ’ @entity8 as ‘ one of the most misunderstood countries on earth ’			0
other specialist travel agencies have also reported rising bookings for @entity8 in the last 12 months			2
but government advice on trips to the @entity22 country remains cautious			1
a @entity166 spokesman said : ‘ we would advise people to keep up to date with our relevant travel advice on @entity8			1
‘ we advise against all but essential travel to the country as a whole and against all travel to regions close to the @entity176 and @entity177 borders			1
‘ there are risks for @entity11 nationals in @entity8 and especially those going off the beaten track - but it ’s a matter of choice for individuals			0
