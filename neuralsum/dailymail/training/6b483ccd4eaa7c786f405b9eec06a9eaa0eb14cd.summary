by @entity1 reporter published : 16:56 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 10:28 est , 12 october 2013 the term ' bionic man ' was the stuff of science fiction in the 1970s , when a popular tv show called ' @entity7 ' chronicled the adventures of @entity9 , a former astronaut whose body was rebuilt using artificial parts after he nearly died			1
now , a team of engineers has assembled a robot using artificial organs , limbs and other body parts that comes tantalizingly close to a true ' bionic man			1
' for real , this time			0
the parts hail from 17 manufacturers around the world			0
this is the first time they 've been assembled together , says @entity43 , managing director of @entity44 and the lead roboticist on the project			0
' ( it 's ) an attempt to showcase just how far medical science has gotten , ' he says			2
the robot making appearances in the @entity51 for the first time this week			0
having crossed the @entity53 tucked inside two metal trunks — and after a brief holdup in customs — the bionic man will strut his stuff at the @entity60 festival on friday			1
a working heart : through its clear arteries , the bionic man can be seen pumping blood @entity43 says the robot has about 60 to 70 percent of the function of a human			1
it stands six - and - a - half feet tall and can step , sit and stand with the help of a @entity72 walking machine that 's used by people who 've lost the ability to walk due to a spinal injury			1
it also has a functioning heart that , using an electronic pump , beats and circulates artificial blood , which carries oxygen just like human blood			1
an artificial , implantable kidney , meanwhile , replaces the function of a modern - day dialysis unit			1
although the parts used in the robot work , many of them are a long way from being used in humans			0
the kidney , for example , is only a prototype			2
and there are some key parts missing : there 's no digestive system , liver , or skin			2
and , of course , no brain			0
watch it flow : blood being pumped through arteries seen up close the bionic man was modeled after @entity20 , a 36 - year - old social psychologist at the @entity21 who was born without his lower left arm and wears a bionic prosthesis			1
the man 's face was created based on a 3d scan of @entity20 's face			2
' we wanted to showcase that the technology can provide aesthetic prostheses for people who have lost parts of their faces , for example , their nose , due to an accident or due to , for example , cancer , ' @entity20 says			0
@entity20 says he initially felt a sense of unease when he saw the robot for the first time			0
the original : the first bionic man , as seen in the 1970s television show ' the six million dollar man ' ' i thought it was rather revolting to be honest , ' he says			1
' it was quite a shock to see a face that closely resembles what i see in the mirror every morning on this kind of dystopian looking machine			0
' he has since warmed up to it , especially after the " man " was outfitted with some clothes from the @entity144 department store @entity143			2
and the cost ? as it turns out , this bionic man comes cheaper than his $ 6 - million - dollar sci - fi cousin			1
while the parts used in the experiment were donated , their value is about $ 1 million .			0

the ' bionic man ' *phrase* was *coined* from popular 1970 's television show ' @entity7 '
built using artificial organs , this bionic man has a beating heart , working kidney , lungs , and *pancreas* - it can also hear and see
it has between 60 to 60 per cent of *normal* human functions
