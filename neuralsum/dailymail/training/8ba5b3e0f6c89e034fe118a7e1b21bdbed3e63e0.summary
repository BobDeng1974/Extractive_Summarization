by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 believes @entity2 is still the right man for the @entity4 job , despite criticism from fans last season			1
speculation was rife that @entity2 , 59 , was on borrowed time with the club 's owners after the previous campaign was tinged with periods of disappointment			1
having led the @entity4 to a top - half finish in 2012/13 , @entity2 oversaw a barren run over the turn of the year and reacted angrily when his side were jeered off the pitch following a home win over @entity21			1
backing : @entity1 arrives at training today where he backed his manager to succeed ready to go : @entity2 arrived at training too but did n't sport the new @entity4 shirt championship : 2012/13 win percentage : 55.1 % goals per game scored : 1.80 goals per game conceded : 1 finish : 3rd - promoted via the playoffs @entity30 : 2012/13 , 2013/2014 win percentage : 30 % goals per game scored : 1.12 goals per game conceded : 1.37 finished : 10th then 13th despite those issues , as well as banners being unfurled and opinion polls being held calling for his head , co-chairmen @entity36 and @entity38 have stuck by @entity2 , something @entity1 feels will stand the club in good stead			1
' it is great , ' the @entity42 international said			0
' as soon as the news came out over the summer the lads were delighted			0
he has done well for the last two years , we were n't too happy last season but we finished 13th in the end			2
' he is so good , he sets out a plan for the whole season and how many points we need to finish as high as we can and improve on last year			1
' the first couple of years is always tough - you see teams stay up in the first season and struggle in the second year			2
last year we were n't too happy but a lot of teams would have taken that			0
' we are looking to kick on this year , the gaffer has already brought in a couple of new signings and i 'm sure there will be more			0
' not once has the gaffer ever told us to play direct			0
it is about winning football matches , before every game he works out the best way to win and that is how we go out and play			2
' protests : many @entity4 fans were unhappy with @entity2 's management last season you what ? @entity2 reacts to the boos in @entity4 's win over @entity21 at @entity78 @entity1 was speaking on the first day of pre-season training , with new signings @entity81 and @entity82 joined at @entity4 's @entity84 training base by the likes of @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , who is back with the @entity4 having spent the back end of last season on - loan at @entity91			1
a left - back is believed to be @entity2 's next target , with @entity95 's @entity94 rumoured to be on the brink of a move to east @entity98 , and @entity1 wants to keep up the good work from the @entity4 defensive unit			1
' defensively we did alright last season , ' he added			0
' we had 14 clean sheets so like the gaffer has said we need to concentrate on scoring more goals - that is why he has brought in @entity106 ( @entity107 ) to improve us in the attacking half so hopefully we can score more goals and get off to a better start			0
' we ( the defenders ) have all been here a while now and know each other 's game very well so whoever is asked to play knows what is expected of them - it is a great group of lads so hopefully we can start off well and kick on from there			2
' tough : @entity4 had an up - and - down season but beating @entity120 3 - 0 at @entity121 was a highlight			0
