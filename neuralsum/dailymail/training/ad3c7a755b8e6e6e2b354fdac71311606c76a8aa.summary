with awards season in full swing , and best - dressed lists being quietly curated , the pressure is on for a-listers to pull out showstopping look after look on the red carpet			1
luckily for @entity10 's leading ladies , they can rely on expert advice from those whose sole job it is to pick out an outfit that 's going to garner headlines for all the right reasons			0
one stylist shaking things up in @entity10 is @entity19 , a savvy 29 - year - old who has the power to transform actresses from relative obscurity to global style icons			1
she began working with @entity29 star @entity28 ( right ) who then introduced her to @entity31 her work on @entity31 is a case in point			1
when the 12 years a slave star stepped out at last year 's @entity36 in a flowing blue @entity38 gown , with a slashed yet sophisticated neckline , she became a style icon			1
of course , @entity19 , whose first client was @entity42 for the @entity43 and @entity45 press tours , was behind the look			2
@entity19 and @entity31 were introduced by another stylish screen star ; @entity28			1
@entity31 was a little - known @entity48 actress working on movie non-stop with @entity28 , who said to her : ‘ when you ’re ready , i have the perfect stylist for you			1
' the rest was history			0
@entity54 helped transform the red carpet , which , in the late 90s , was awash with prom dresses loved by @entity57 and the @entity59 look , as championed by @entity60			2
@entity28 , resplendent in @entity61 , met @entity19 through her make - up artist when the 12 years a slave star @entity31 stepped out at last year 's @entity36 , left , in a flowing blue @entity38 gown , with a slashed yet sophisticated neckline , she became a muse			1
her red @entity68 gown at last year 's @entity69 was also exquisite @entity31 looking chic in a @entity71 couture dress at the @entity72 in 2014 , left , and pushing the style boundaries in @entity38 at last year 's @entity74 the 31 - year - old actress 's striking minimalist style curated by @entity19 has had the fashion world buzzing			1
hits have included her silk @entity38 jersey maxidress with ethereal gold lattice embroidery at the @entity82 for the premiere of 12 years a slave			1
her striking red @entity68 number from the @entity69 was simple yet stunning , while her punky @entity87 gown at the @entity88 showed her ability to experiment with trends			0
@entity92 - born , @entity91 - raised @entity19 , who studied at @entity93 , turns to trusted and classic designers , such as @entity95 , great @entity10 couturier @entity96 and @entity87 but works to pick a dress that reflects her client 's personality and tastes			2
@entity31 , for example , landed on every glossy magazine 's best - dressed list thanks to her fresh , modern , and compellingly confident style ; @entity19 helps her take risks but in a wearable way			1
according to @entity107 , @entity19 , who began working for the late @entity109 , who was known for styling @entity110 , creates private @entity112 boards for each client			2
here , as well as via text , she shares her ideas with them and what looks and styles she thinks would suit them			0
' it 's a conversation , a collaboration , down to a @entity122 , ' she said of the process			0
@entity28 , left , in a form - fitting @entity125 dress at the @entity127 lunch last january , and , right , at 2013 's @entity128 in a two - tone @entity38 gown in ruby - red satin and burgundy silk ' we 're always looking to tell a story through image			1
in some ways , i almost feel that the red carpet is the runway now and it ’s up to , in some part , the talented actors and actresses that walk that red carpet to show the world what fashion can be			2
' speaking about @entity19 's influence on the red carpet , @entity146 , founder of @entity147 , said : ' @entity19 is what every a-lister wants in their life : a friend , fashion insider and super stylist all tied into one			1
' she has all the best designers - both established and budding - on speed dial and actually takes the time to get to know her clients and figure out what works for them			0
she turns to fashion - insider favorites , such as @entity163 , power players like @entity38 and fledgling designers such as @entity61 , who @entity28 looks phenomenal in			2
' @entity19 , pictured with @entity166 , creates private @entity112 boards for each client and shares her ideas with them @entity19 , who studied at @entity93 , turns to trusted and classic designers when dressing her clients @entity19 wo n't be the only stylist working overtime around awards season - and it seems most stars have a go - to fashion expert on speed dial			1
@entity179 's on - trend red carpet style has often impressed the fashion pack			1
but the @entity183 @entity182 actress revealed it is thanks to no natural flair of her own			0
the 25 - year - old admitted she was forced to seek the services of @entity189 , a celebrity stylist , in order to keep up with the fashionable @entity10 starlets that surround her when she first started out			1
the younger sister of @entity194 and @entity195 told the hollywood reporter : ' there 's no way you can figure it all out , especially when you are working on films			0
you literally have to use a stylist			0
' whatever you wear is like a huge statement out to the world so you have to have someone help you figure it all out			0
' red carpet fashion in the 90s was a whole different story , as proved by @entity210 , left , in mint green @entity211 at the 1998 @entity36 and @entity213 , right , in an off - pink prom-esque gown at the same event @entity57 in a candy coloured prom gown as she arrives for the 71st annual @entity36 in 1999 , left , and @entity218 at the same event fast - forward to 2007 and the red carpet was still all about feathers , drama and show - stopping gowns the actress added that she ' had no clue ' what to wear when she began making public appearances			1
she said : ' i did n't even like to wear dresses to begin with			0
' it was n't until the late 1980s that the ' stylist ' was born , with @entity232 being hailed as the gamechanger			0
he dressed a-listers such as @entity236 and @entity237 in his designs and others began to follow suit			0
the classic silhouettes of the @entity243 were the strapless mermaid look , and the waisted ball gown , loved by @entity57			0
retro glamour was the order of the day but now , stars want to stand out from the crowd and are opting for more spontaenous and somewhat risque designs			0
luckily for today 's stars , red carpet fashion has come a long way since the 90s			2
gone are the days when stars - @entity257 ( left , at the @entity69 in 1999 and , @entity258 in 2003 ) - played it safe in black @entity189 , left , at the @entity36 in 1988 , right , @entity260 in a white tuxedo backwards to the @entity36 in 1999 there are , of course , moments in red carpet history that will go down as game changers			1
remember when @entity189 wore her barely - there @entity270 gown to pick up her best actress @entity36 in 1988 ? or when @entity260 chose to wear a white tuxedo backwards to the @entity36 in 1999 ? these moments of true individuality have , ultimately , paved the way for new stars to be able to express themselves on red carpets the world over			2
now , we are all a little disappointed if @entity258 just wears black , or if @entity281 chooses another strapless number			0
we want more from our celebrities			0
and thanks to the efforts of designers , a lot of whom create up to six collections a year , there are thousands of bold , unique , and sometimes hand - embellished couture dresses to pick from			2
a prom - style dress , or something that is ' old school ' ( and not in a good way ) , wo n't cut it anymore			2
stars such as @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity31 are very much led by creative stylists who push boundaries			0
and it has made the world a much brighter place , fashion-wise			0
stars like @entity298 , left , at the @entity36 2014 , and @entity299 , right , at the @entity69 , are very much led by creative stylists who push boundaries , shunning standard black dresses for more daring cuts and textures the more extreme dressers , like @entity311 and @entity312 , are pushing the envelope even further , often championing new and emerging designers ; something we would n't have seen years ago			0
and we must n't forget the late , great @entity317 - the one fearless , say - what - she - thought red carpet critic who single - handily turned red carpets into a thing to be watched by the whole world			1
speaking about the shift , celebrity dresser and @entity328 selfie stylist , @entity329 , who has worked with the likes of @entity332 and @entity333 , said : ' red carpet style makes me so happy because it 's not necessarily about sticking strictly to trends but more about wearing what you love and letting it be an extension of your personality			1
' we 've seen everything from tuxedos to top and skirt combos and while i think it 's important to dress appropriately , you only get one shot on the red carpet so you may as well maximise your experience through your outfit			1
getting ready is half the fun ! ' .			0
