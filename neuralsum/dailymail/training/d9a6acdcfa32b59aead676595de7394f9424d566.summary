by @entity0 a revealing new book will lift the lid on the secrets behind @entity5 ’s most beloved comedy show – snl - and the battles that raged between politicians over its most famous political satire sketches			1
the book : ' live from @entity11 : an @entity12 by @entity13 and @entity14 will include 200 extra pages of material which did not appear in the original 2002 book			1
according to excerpts from @entity21 , @entity19 's ' entitled attitude ' could have indirectly helped then senator @entity22 to win the @entity24 nomination to run in 2008			1
appearance : in 2007 , then senator @entity22 , right , appeared on snl with @entity27 , left , as @entity28 , @entity29 as @entity19 during the ' @entity31 ' skit @entity26 : @entity22 stands in front of @entity19 who cancelled her appearance on @entity26 in 2007 which led to @entity22 appearing on it instead according to the book , @entity28 ’s campaign lobbied for her to guest host snl for the show ’s season opener in 2007 , when the former first lady was still favored to win the 2008 @entity24 nomination			1
but on the week of production , her campaign cancelled , leaving a spot open			2
this , it ’s thought , led a little known senator called @entity22 to take her place — possibly influencing the outcome of the 2008 presidential campaign			1
executive producer @entity53 recalls : ‘ we put @entity22 on the date when @entity19 was supposed to be on			1
’ ‘ the sense of entitlement which was following her everywhere at that point peaked for me at the bailing , ’ he added			0
entitled : snl executive producer @entity53 recalls : ' we put @entity22 on the date when @entity19 was supposed to be on			1
' another excerpt reveals that @entity64 felt like she had been portrayed ‘ as an idiot , ’ by the gifted @entity26 comedian @entity65			1
this made her want to come on the show and change people 's perception			1
@entity64 said : ‘ i know that they portrayed me as an idiot and i hated that and i wanted to come on the show and counter some of that			2
’ this , it appears was the incentive behind her awkward 2008 appearance alongside cast member @entity65			1
@entity65 , captured national attention when she imitated @entity64 ’s trademark beehive , red suit and distinctive accent and made the phrase : ‘ i can see @entity85 from my house , ’ world famous			1
before her appearance , family members had told @entity65 that she was the spitting image of the vice presidential nominee			2
but she was n’t convinced			0
spot the difference : @entity26 comedian @entity65 impersonates @entity93 vice presidential nominee @entity64 , right , on @entity26 who appeared on the show because she felt she was portrayed as an idiot lookalike : before @entity65 took on the role as @entity64 , her family said she looked similar to the vice presidential nominee @entity64 but she ignored them she told them : ‘ i do n't think so			1
it 's just brown hair and glasses			0
but some cousins and old classmates were all saying , ‘ that lady looks like you			0
’ ' ‘ i was sort of — arrogantly , in my own mind — resisting it , like , ‘ i do n't want to play that , and i do n't know who 's gon na write it , and what if i do n't like what they wrote , people are going to think that i wrote it			0
’ but after she executed the character perfectly and @entity64 agreed to appear , @entity53 said @entity65 was ' terrified of anything where they would be together looking like an endorsement			1
' @entity53 even called on celebrity friends to come and see the segment			0
he said : ' i called @entity126 [ @entity126 ] to come in for [ @entity64 's appearance on oct. 18 , 2008 ] , to be standing with me , because he was the most emblematic liberal at that point			2
dream team : @entity65 , left and @entity26 executive producer @entity53 recalls how he called @entity126 to come in for @entity64 's appearance in 2008 ' he said he had to introduce a documentary at the @entity133 on that saturday , so he would n't be able to do it			1
' so i said , ' @entity126 , your instincts are always great , but are you telling me you 're not going to be here for this thing that the whole world is waiting to see ? ' yet , viewers tuned in in their droves to that particular segment which helped @entity26 draw its largest audience in 14 years with 14 million viewers			0
@entity64 added : ' if i ran into @entity65 again today , i would say : ' you need to at least pay for my kids ' braces or something from all the money that you made off of pretending that you 're me ! ' my goodness , you capitalized on that ! ca n't you contribute a little bit ? jeez ! ' in another excerpt , writer @entity152 appealed to @entity22 to talk with @entity156 network chiefs who had expressed concern over a sketch which could be offensive to @entity159			1
this was when @entity22 was doing a cameo on the show			2
but he turned them down saying ‘ it ’s funny , but no , i do n’t think so			0
' however , @entity22 ’s influence on the show was widespread			2
@entity167 , a writer - producer who retired in 2013 said : ‘ the last couple seasons of the show were the only two in the show ’s history where we were totally like every other comedy show : basically , an arm of the @entity177 @entity24 establishment			2
‘ @entity178 was more nuanced			0
we just stopped doing anything which could even be misinterpreted as a criticism of @entity22			0
’ meanwhile , @entity181 , castmember recalls how he did an event at @entity184 's house			0
he said : ‘ i was trying to take my makeup off because i was @entity22 at this event , and [ @entity22 ] stood right there watching me do it			0
‘ he was laughing ; it was so petrifying			0
as long as there 's no beef between me and the president , that 's good			0
when that happens , you 're @entity195			0
’ in more sombre times , like right after 9/11 , cast and crew recall how they were forced to give politics a rest because of the sensitivity surrounding events			0
however , important political figures , presidential hopefuls and others have made it an important stop ever since president @entity208 ’s first appearance in 1976 .			2
