by @entity0 @entity1 has created an algorithm that can pick a face out of a crowd almost as accurately as a human			1
called @entity7 , it uses technology the firm bought when it acquired @entity11 startup face.com last year			2
its creators say it pick a face out of a crowd with 97.25 per cent accuracy			1
@entity7 uses a 3 - d model to rotate faces , virtually , so that they face the camera			2
image ( a ) shows the original image , and ( g ) shows the final , corrected version which the software can then attempt to recognise			0
@entity24 and colleagues at @entity1 's ai lab found a way to build a 3d model of a face from a photo that can be rotated into the best position for the algorithm to start matching			1
they then used a neural network that had been trained on a massive database of faces to try and match the face with one in a test database of more than 4 million images , containing more than 4000 separate identities , each one labelled by humans			1
' we revisit both the alignment step and the representation step by employing explicit 3d face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation , and derive a face representation from a nine - layer deep neural network , ' the team wrote			2
the system can now identify faces at virtually the same level of accuracy as a human the team achieved 97.25 per cent accuracy on the test data that contained more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web			0
a test using real people recruited on @entity65 's @entity64 crowdsourcing site managed 97.5 per cent			0
details will be presented at the @entity68 and @entity69 conference in @entity70 , @entity71 , in june			0
experts say @entity1 could use it to identify all of a user 's real friends are			1
' they could identify every one of your friends in all of your photos , ' @entity76 of the @entity77 told @entity82			0
' this would let them know who your real friends are â€“ people you actually hang out with in the real world			0

@entity90 was trained by *analysing* pictures *uploaded* to @entity1
can ' spin ' a head to get a clear look at the face using @entity97
