have you ever wondered exactly what happens to the unused toiletries in hotel room bathrooms ? or how a hotel handles it if a guest dies during their stay ? hotel industry insider turned author @entity10 shares his tales from working in two top hotels in @entity13 and @entity14 and provides lots of little - known tips to ensure guests make the most of every hotel stay			1
but some individuals staying at the hotel take things a bit too far			2
' they take everything , ' he tells @entity20			0
' @entity51 covers , little silver trashcans , universal remotes - anything that 's not nailed down			2
' despite common misconceptions , it is possible to pocket a plush robe - without incurring any charges what can you usually get away with taking ? despite common misconceptions , you actually can get away with stealing that coveted hotel room robe			1
' if you were to , say , check into a room , take a fresh robe and pack it away in your suitcase , then call down and say your room did n't have a robe in it when you checked in , is the hotel staff going to search your belongings ? highly unlikely , ' @entity10 reveals			1
and when it comes to pocketing toiletries , you can occasionally even ask for more			0
' there are other items , as well - complimentary amenities that you may not be aware are available , ' he explains			1
' good hotels keep extra items , such as slippers , razors and shaving cream , travel lint rollers , and mini-deodorants , in stock but not displayed in the room			2
' as it turns out , the minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel , full of items ' sold at an absurd mark - up ' if you lie about using the minibar , will the hotel really charge you ? ' the minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel , ' @entity10 tells @entity20			1
' human error , over-stocking , failure to re-stock , errant charges from weighted items being shifted but not consumed , all of these lead the front desk to spend hours a day slicing off incorrect charges			0
' he also notes that the ' items are purchased in bulk and sold at an absurd mark - up			2
' ' hotels are much more concerned with your overall experience and securing further room nights - the main revenue stream - than whether or not you ate a candy bar			2
' @entity116 , a front office supervisor at a major hotel chain and an adjunct hospitality instructor , adds : ' if an item has not sold , it 's just like any other retail setting - the item is pulled when it reaches its expiration date			1
' because certain rooms have varying levels of cleaning difficulty , they are usually awarded ' points ' how long does it take to clean a hotel room ? is there anything that typically does not get cleaned ? the length of cleaning time generally depends on the room			1
because rooms have varying levels of difficulty , they are usually awarded ' points ' and housekeepers must clean a certain total of points in one day			0
this may translate to a few larger suites or simply multiple standard rooms			0
' i 'd guess the average time is between 30 minutes to an hour to flip the room , ' @entity10 estimates			1
' a great deal of that time discrepancy depends on how the guest has left the room			0
' once a year , large sections of rooms , or even entire floors are pulled out of service for maintenance and deep cleaning			0
' this is includes sending the draperies out for cleaning and shampooing the carpets , ' @entity116 explains			0
however , minibar glasses are often cleaned less thoroughly , usually soaked in shampoo or furniture polish when it comes to the items that are cleaned less frequently or less thoroughly ? minibar glasses and the remote control			1
' housekeepers are usually responsible for cleaning the glasses , yet are not provided with dish soap , ' he explains			2
' so they either soak them in the sink with shampoo or , in a pinch , use furniture polish , as it leaves a ' clean - looking ' shine			1
' and have you ever tried to clean your own remote ? ' the rubbery buttons make it near impossible and dousing it with a cleaning agent could damage the circuitry , ' @entity10 adds			1
how much money hotels spend on toiletries generally depends on the scale of the property and its occupancy how much do hotels generally spend on toiletries per year ? this one has everything to do with the scale of the property and its occupancy			0
according to a recent @entity200 article , the @entity198 hotel chain will spend approximately $ 20 million annually on their @entity202 products , a natural skincare line that 's stocked in their @entity205 and @entity206 hotels			2
' usually the ordering is done by a housekeeping manager who takes into account the current supply and the average monthly uses from years past , ' @entity10 reveals			1
' people use more toiletries in the winter , have longer showers , and go through more toilet paper			0
' it 's a rather intriguing ordering process based on a large amount of collected data			0
' and , ultimately , you do n't want to be the one who fails to order enough toilet paper for the entire hotel			2
' though there 's a belief that hotel staffer furnish their home with amenities , @entity10 says it 's not often the case and do staff ever get to take them home ? ' there 's a long history of hotel staffers semi-furnishing their own home with hotel amenities , ' @entity10 admits			1
' every party i threw from 2001 to 2004 was catered with hotel pillow chocolates			2
' for the most part , items are either so pre-used that to take them would be distasteful , or so expensive that to steal them would n't be worth the loss of one 's job			2
' but i do have shoe polish that i 've never paid for and hotel - branded slippers to keep me comfy in the wintertime			1
' one charity has come up with a novel way to deal with leftover hotel soaps - churning them together to provide soap to those in developing countries			1
clean @entity259 , receives partially - used and discarded soap from hotels , recycles it into millions of new bars , and then works with partner @entity263 to strategically distribute the new soap to people who lack access to it around the world			0
people dying in their hotel room is not quite as rare of an occurrence as guests may think , @entity10 admits what happens if someone dies in a hotel room ? while a bit morbid to talk about , @entity10 admits that such an occurrence is not quite as rare as guests may think			1
' it 's not something a hotel wishes to publicise , naturally , ' he explains			0
' so , they are removed as discreetly as possible			0
' this may involve flashing lights and paramedics , depending on the severity of the situation , but can also happen via employee elevators and back exits			0
' afterwards , the room is sanitised , cleaned , ' flipped ' and sold - and that can happen a lot faster than you 'd think			1
and , of course , all hotel staffers are forbidden from revealing any details - including cause of death and room numbers - to anyone			1
' death is a part of hotel life , ' @entity10 adds			1
' in fact , suicides often prefer hotels , relieving loved ones of the cleaning duties or seeing the deceased in a disturbing way			0
' guests should take comfort in knowing that their in - room safes are actually very secure do staff actually have access to the in - room safes ? no , they do not			0
the safes truly are , you know , safe			0
' i always recommend using the safe to every traveller , ' @entity10 says			1
' the only person who can open the safe , should you forget your password , is a manager from the security department , using a tool that only they are trained and authorised to use			0
' what really happens to that half - used roll of loo paper in hotel room bathrooms ? well , it depends ... and finally , what happens to the half - used loo roll in hotel room bathrooms ? there 's a bit of dispute over this one , and again , a lot of times it depends on the hotel itself			2
in the spirit of being environmentally - minded , most chains will simply refold the paper and leave the half - used roll in the bathroom , with another full roll behind it , should the guest run out			0
if there 's not enough left to warrant leaving it , a @entity351 thread user , who works for the @entity352 , believes that the nearly - used up roll most likely winds up on housekeeping carts for when a room attendant needs a tissue for other cleaning tasks or in employee bathrooms .			0

yes , it is possible to steal a robe from your hotel without being charged
many properties often have extra complimentary amenities up for grabs
but beware of minibar glasses - they *'re* often cleaned with furniture polish
