last weekend , after a sunny day in the @entity2 , i posted this picture of myself on @entity4 with the caption ‘ just met @entity0 lookalike out canvassing ! ’ i admit , it was n’t a particularly funny joke , but i had no idea of the outrage my light - hearted comment would provoke from the devoted followers of @entity13 ’s first minister and the leader of the @entity15			1
i was called ugly , vile , ‘ someone who deserves to die ’ , and one wit even ‘ hoped i would catch malaria ’			1
in all , i ’ve probably received more than 600 insults , and two days later they ’re still coming			2
luckily , i ’ve got a thick skin , but whatever happened to free speech ? in the knockabout atmosphere of an election campaign , everything is up for debate			2
the @entity44 is home to a rich and raucous tradition of political satire , from 19th century caricaturists such as @entity48 and @entity49 , to more recent cartoonists @entity51 , @entity52 and those in @entity54 , as well as tv series such as @entity56 , @entity57 and have i got news for you			2
most of our most successful comedians sneer at the party leaders			2
so you might imagine that the @entity13 could cope with a few harmless jibes about their own first minister			2
wrong , wrong , wrong			0
all the pollsters agree that the @entity15 is destined to win the vast majority of the seats ( up to 50 ) @entity13 in the general election , crushing the @entity72 and trouncing @entity73			1
they already control the majority of votes in the @entity77			0
could this surge of nationalism mean that @entity13 is in danger of becoming another @entity81 , a land where the ‘ dear leader ’ is sacrosanct , a figure on a pedestal , to be worshipped and admired — but never criticised ? at the weekend , one commentator announced that ‘ @entity13 has fallen in love with @entity0 — she is adored ’			1
indeed last night ms @entity0 was as feisty as ever in the leaders ’ debate			1
my goodness , you certainly could n’t say that about any party leader @entity94 , or in @entity95			2
despite all the photo calls at factories , in schools and cafes and villages halls , poll after poll shows that the public find most @entity44 politicians ‘ out of touch ’			0
@entity106 and @entity107 have ‘ minus ’ personal ratings , while even @entity112 ’s @entity111 , once the poster boy for the disaffected , could be in danger of losing his bid to become an mp in @entity116			0
@entity27 said she had no idea of the outrage her ' light - hearted comment ' would provoke from @entity0 's ( pictured ) supporters so how has @entity0 become @entity121 , a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means ( according to her fans ) i can no longer be considered a feminist ? according to her followers , i am a traitor to my sex , a woman less attractive than @entity131 , a sub-human who should be neutered			1
it ’s all beginning to sound like a repressive communist state			0
sadly , some @entity15 supporters combine commendable patriotism with a deep - seated distrust of the @entity138 — not just the posh people from down here , but anyone born in the ‘ wrong ’ country			1
i first encountered this when i made an hour - long documentary for @entity145 last year , looking at voting intentions in the independence referendum			0
i love @entity13 and have spent many happy weeks walking , working and fishing there , so making this film was a real pleasure			0
i talked to people of all persuasions in the @entity2 , the @entity153 between @entity154 and @entity155 , and in the @entity156			0
we went to inordinate lengths to present a scrupulously balanced film — but when it was transmitted , because i was born in @entity138 ( and am actually half - @entity95 ) i was attacked in the @entity30 , on @entity4 and other social media for having the audacity to host a programme about ‘ their ’ country			1
some @entity15 members are so consumed with themselves that all they want is people to agree with them , and sod everyone else			1
they are blinkered zealots incapable of reasoned debate			0
during their aggressive campaign for independence — which got the knockback by a sizeable margin , with 55 pc in favour of remaining in the @entity44 — the @entity171 earned a reputation for ruthlessly attacking anyone who did n’t agree with them			0
the author @entity181 was denounced as unpatriotic for daring to speak out in favour of @entity13 remaining part of the @entity44			0
dubbed the @entity185 and the @entity186 , fanatical @entity15 followers use social media to ‘ troll ’ opponents , and anyone daring to criticise their leader			1
when the @entity145 political editor @entity191 reported from @entity13 on the referendum last year , the @entity171 took such offence to what they regarded as his biased broadcasts that hundreds of marchers took to the streets carrying a huge banner with the words ‘ @entity201 “ @entity200 , a totally corrupt journalist '			2
but they do n’t stop at professional attacks			0
when @entity200 announced a few weeks ago that he had a cancerous tumour on his lung , the @entity186 went straight on @entity4 with comments such as ‘ a bit of chemotherapy would do the biased @entity209 man good ’			1
in similar vein , after a @entity211 writer published a profile of @entity0 in these pages recently , he was attacked relentlessly online , and called a @entity216 , racist scum , a vile bigot , a misogynist , and told to f * * * off back to @entity138			1
many of those abusing him had a blue @entity171 ‘ 45 ’ logo on their @entity4 feed , to represent the percentage who voted for independence last year			1
so what of the woman these people idolise as some great political saviour unlike any other figure in @entity44 today ? @entity27 ( right ) asks how @entity0 ( left ) has become ' a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means ( according to her fans ) i can no longer be considered a feminist ? ' consider the facts : ms @entity0 , just like @entity106 , has spent her whole life ( apart from a brief period working as a solicitor ) entirely engrossed in politics			1
her husband and her former boyfriends and most of her friends all work for the @entity15			1
yet it is @entity106 , not @entity0 , who gets derided for being ‘ weird ’ and having not experienced the real world			1
from 1992 onwards , she unsuccessfully stood for seat after seat in local and national elections , before eventually gaining a place in the @entity249 via a quota system in 1999			0
she had a total image make - over in 2004 — hiring a stylist , changing her @entity254 - style hairdo , losing weight and softening her approach			0
but make no mistake , she is as ruthless an operator as any other party leader			2
her stated goal is @entity13 independence , no matter what effect that might have on the rest of the @entity44 , even though her party lost what was supposed to be a ‘ once - in - a - generation ’ vote on this issue last year			0
when questioned on television this week , she refused to rule out a second referendum in the very near future			0
when it comes to dealing with the deficit and setting out an economic strategy , @entity271 , @entity106 and @entity107 have had their plans ruthlessly dissected			0
@entity0 , however , based her sums on an oil boom that has failed to materialise , which has deprived the @entity13 economy of billions of pounds of expected revenue			1
she wants @entity13 to be responsible for raising its own taxes , but when an independent think - tank , the @entity283 , looked at her plans for tax and spending and said they would result in a whopping £ 7.6 billion deficit , she described their findings as ‘ irrelevant ’			0
yes , i admire @entity0 ’s tenacity , and i applaud any woman who rises to the top in her chosen profession			1
i know from experience just how tough that can be			0
nevertheless , we find ourselves in the unenviable position of facing an election where a party that 60 million @entity44 can not vote for — the @entity15 — could hold the balance of power at @entity301			2
it is a self - proclaimed ‘ progressive ’ party which hypocritically accepted £ 2.5 million of donations from @entity304 , the @entity305 boss who does n’t believe in equal rights for gays			0
does that make her any different to @entity106 , with his much - criticised relationships with the trade unions , or @entity271 with his cronies in @entity313 ? voters in @entity138 can do nothing to stop the @entity0 bandwagon gaining momentum — @entity15 membership has tripled in the past year , and it ’s now the third - largest political party in the @entity44			1
but worrying questions remain about some of her followers			1
by trying to stifle debate and silence any jokes ( no matter how feeble ) about their leader , they are beginning to look more like fanatics than political supporters .			2

@entity27 joked about @entity15 leader @entity0 on @entity4
the journalist was called ugly , vile and ' someone who deserves to die '
says worrying questions remain about some of the @entity15 leader 's followers
