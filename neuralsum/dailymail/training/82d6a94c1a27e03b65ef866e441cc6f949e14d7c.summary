a baby boy born with eight limbs is said to be recovering well after doctors removed his ' parasitic twin '			1
three - month old baby @entity4 was born with four legs and four arms in @entity7 , a small village in eastern @entity8			1
parents @entity9 and @entity11 rushed the child to a nearby district hospital but were told there was nothing medics could do			2
doctors also discovered that the parasitic twin shared part of the boy 's pelvic bone			0
surgeons then discharged the baby for three months , allowing him to grow large enough for them to safely operate on him			1
on august 18 , three surgeons performed on @entity39 at the @entity8 hospital			1
over three hours they carefully separated parts of the parasitic twin from his body			2
dr @entity45 , one of the surgeons who carried out the operation , told @entity48 : ' the baby was given general anesthesia and the torso and trunk of the parasitic twin -- which had two arms but no head or heart -- was detached from the host baby			2
a team of surgeons led by dr @entity23 , a consultant paediatric surgeon , assessed the little boy and discovered that not only did he have four extra limbs and what appeared to be an extra chest , but that his heart and the liver were on the wrong sides on august 18 , three surgeons performed on @entity39 at the @entity8 hospital			1
over three hours they carefully separated parts of the parasitic twin from his body ' then we also detached the lower limbs of the parasitic twin from the host , which included disarticulating the right and left lower limbs as they were attached by joints			1
we controlled the bleeding and fashioned skin flaps to close the resulting wound			0
he said there was only minor blood loss and no post-operation complications			0
now , three weeks after surgery the baby looks set to make a full recovery and is now breastfeeding from his mother			2
earlier this year doctors successfully removed a baby 's extra limbs after it was born with four hands and four feet at a hospital in @entity93 's southern @entity92 province			1
the 13 - day - old boy , from @entity95 , was born joined to a headless parasitic twin joined at the torso on april 2			2
now , three weeks after surgery at @entity18 the baby looks set to make a full recovery and is now breastfeeding from his mother an an eight - limbed girl , @entity101 , made headlines when she underwent a similar separation surgery from a parasitic twin in 2007			1
parasitic twins are extremely rare			0
identical twins form when a single egg splits during fertilisation - as opposed to two eggs both being fertilised			0
conjoined twins form when a split egg fails to fully separate			0
a ‘ parasite ’ conjoined twin can survive but not when one absorbs the other			0
in 2012 surgeons in @entity116 operated on a three year old boy to remove a 9in - long parasitic twin weighing a pound and a half			1
in 2008 doctors had to remove a 2in embryo from the body of a nine - year - old girl in @entity125			0
the brain , lungs and heart are some of the last parts of the body to develop			0
removing a parasitic twin is usually easier than attempting to separate conjoined twins .			0

@entity4 was born with eight limbs in @entity7 , eastern @entity8
he was referred to @entity18 in the @entity8 capital of @entity20
there , surgeons operated on the three month old for three hours
