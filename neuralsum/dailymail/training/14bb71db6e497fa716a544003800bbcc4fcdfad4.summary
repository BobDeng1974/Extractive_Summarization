@entity0 will enter the @entity1 in the third qualifying round on july 31 along with @entity4 giants @entity3 and @entity5			1
their tie is unlikely to be glamorous though â€” they are likely to face the likes of @entity9 from @entity10 , @entity11 from @entity12 or @entity13 from @entity14			0
location : hull play their first game in july , in all likelihood a long way from @entity20 , where they played last back again : spurs went out to @entity23 in the last 16 this year			2
they will start in the fourth qualifying round @entity26 , who finished sixth in the @entity28 , join a round a later for the play - offs while @entity31 join the competition in the group stages			1
as for lucky @entity35 , they can enjoy thursday nights free of the @entity1			0
mr @entity36 will be pleased .			0

*losing* fa *cup* final means @entity0 start qualifying on july 31
likely to face *eastern* @entity4 *opposition*
spurs begin in fourth round , @entity31 qualify to group stages *automatically*
