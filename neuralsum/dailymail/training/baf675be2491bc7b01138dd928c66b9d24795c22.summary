by @entity0 outdoor weddings could be legalised under plans to allow non-religious groups to carry out marriage ceremonies			1
couples would be able to tie the knot in the open air under a proposed law change to allow humanists to conduct marriages			1
the controversial policy could lead to green campaigners or even @entity13 being allowed to have their own ceremonies on mountain tops and river banks			0
a controversial policy could lead to green campaigners or even @entity13 being allowed to have their own ceremonies on mountain tops and river banks			0
file picture some have even claimed @entity22 fans would be able to hold ‘ @entity24 ’ weddings under the new regime			0
at present there are only two types of marriages in @entity29 and @entity31 - religious ceremonies in churches and other buildings ; and civil ceremonies typically in registry offices , but now increasingly in hotels and other registered venues			1
last year the government was forced by a @entity40 defeat to agree to a consultation to allow a third category of weddings - those for non-religious ‘ belief ’ organisations such as the @entity46			2
the law states that most weddings in @entity29 and @entity31 have to take place in a building			1
but the @entity52 said yesterday that , if humanist weddings are allowed , all restrictions on where they can take place may have to be lifted			1
the proposal is contained in an official consultation paper , published by the @entity52 yesterday			0
it suggests strict criteria organisations would have to meet to qualify , in an effort to allay fears that the change could open the way for ‘ @entity24 ’ weddings			1
the law currently states that most weddings in @entity29 and @entity31 have to take place in a building			1
file picture but it raises the prospect of eco-groups , @entity74 or societies dedicated to particular schools of philosophy such as existentialism being able to apply to conduct ceremonies for their followers			0
ministers have not committed to introducing the new category of wedding but promised to carry out a consultation on the idea during last year ’s parliamentary debates on gay marriage			0
the paper points out that unlike religious groups , organisations such as humanists do not have their own buildings			1
that creates legal difficulties because the system of solemnising marriages in @entity29 and @entity31 is based on buildings – either places of worship or venues such as a hotels or stately homes – being registered for weddings			1
it suggests a series of possible solutions including allowing approved groups to conduct weddings ‘ anywhere meaningful to the couple including outdoors ’			2
unlike in @entity112 , where humanist weddings are already conducted , outdoor marriages are not legally recognised in @entity29 and @entity31			1
but a rarely used exception dating back to 1753 already exists , allowing @entity115 and @entity117 groups to conduct outdoor weddings			2
the consultation paper suggests extending that to non-religious groups but notes that some faith groups or people having civil weddings might see this as ‘ unfair ” ’ @entity126 , senior tutor at the @entity127 , said : ‘ i think this would be very popular			0
‘ people want the spiritual element but not necessarily the religious element and this would give people what they want and is probably more in line with the way people see the world today			0
’ a spokeswoman for the @entity46 said : ‘ in the context of current marriage law , giving legal recognition to humanist marriages is not controversial , would meet a genuine public desire , and would have a negative effect on absolutely no one in society			2
‘ it would only go on to improve the married lives and happiness of thousands of couples who wish to have a humanist marriage			0
’ @entity153 , the justice minister , said : ‘ the government considers marriage to be one of our most important institutions and believes it is right for couples to have the choice of a religious or secular marriage ceremony			0
‘ as we committed to do during the passage of the @entity163 , we are now consulting on whether the law should be changed to allow non-religious belief organisations to conduct legally valid marriage ceremonies			2
‘ the government welcomes the views from interested groups and individuals across society			0
