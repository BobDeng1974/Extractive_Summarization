boost : former @entity1 deputy chairman @entity0 , pictured , is stepping in to offer financial support to protect dozens of burial plots of soldiers awarded the @entity5 a campaign to repair and preserve hundreds of neglected graves belonging to @entity9 ’s greatest war heroes today receives a major boost			1
former @entity1 deputy chairman @entity0 is stepping in to offer financial support to protect dozens of burial plots of soldiers awarded the @entity5 – the most distinguished military honour – and he is urging others to follow suit			1
the peer , who has built up a collection of 177 vcs which is on display in @entity22 ’s @entity21 , said he had been distressed by a report in last week ’s @entity24 revealing how hundreds of graves have become neglected , with crumbling headstones and overgrown plots			1
in an article on this page , he says he will provide up to £ 1,000 per plot to restore the graves of any recipients of the @entity5 whose medals are part of his collection			1
lord @entity0 ’s pledge is a significant step forward for a charity which is campaigning for proper respect and honour to be given to the final resting places of war heroes			1
the @entity44 has backed calls for @entity5 graves to be given the same status as listed buildings			1
and , in the week of @entity49 , when the nation honours the sacrifice of those who fought for our freedom , an influential think - tank has called for new laws to protect the burial plots			1
a policy document by the @entity60 said the government must act to register heroes ’ burial sites and , if families agree , ensure they are looked after and given fitting memorials			2
ministers should also scrap the 75 - year limit after which local authorities can dig up the graves if they choose , it says			2
the proposed cost would be £ 1.2million a year			0
there are 1,357 @entity5 winners			2
troops who were killed on the battlefield during the @entity76 and @entity77 – including 377 @entity5 winners – have their resting places tended by the @entity80			2
the organisation also looks after the graves of nine other soldiers given the ultimate accolade – including lieutenant colonel @entity85 and sergeant @entity86 , both killed in the @entity88 , and corporal @entity89 , who lost his life in @entity91			2
but relatives are responsible for the upkeep of graves of @entity5 winners who died in other conflicts or of old age			1
many burial plots have fallen into neglect because family lines dwindle or descendants are unaware they exist or can not afford to maintain them			1
looked after : the @entity80 looks after this grave of lieutenant colonel @entity103 killed in the @entity88			0
but relatives are responsible for the upkeep of graves of @entity5 winners who died in other conflicts or of old age lord @entity0 says he felt ‘ great disappointment and distress ’ to learn that many of the graves of our war heroes have fallen into disrepair			1
@entity115 , research secretary of the @entity60 , said : ‘ the @entity9 affords no protection for those that did not fall in active service			0
with a lack of substantive funding , many @entity5 graves may soon crumble or be destroyed			1
‘ just as monuments to @entity124 , @entity125 and princess @entity126 are protected by the state , so should those of our military heroes			0
’ @entity131 , 45 , a businessman from @entity132 , @entity133 , who started the @entity44 after discovering that lance corporal @entity134 , who won a @entity5 for attacking a @entity136 machine - gun nest during @entity137 , was buried in a neglected grave in a local cemetery , said he was delighted by @entity0 ’s pledge			1
he said his research had uncovered hundreds of examples of graves falling into disrepair			2
mr @entity131 said : ‘ the @entity44 has plenty of heroes – it looks like we now have a new champion			0
without a shadow of a doubt , lord @entity0 ’s offer will make a real difference			1
‘ just about every single one of these graves needs some work			0
all should be cleaned annually , so we ’re building up a network of volunteers			0
we need more support and hope people will be inspired to help by what lord @entity0 is doing			1
’ conservative mp @entity162 said : ‘ the @entity5 is our most prestigious decoration for gallantry and our fallen heroes need to have their memories preserved			2
’ the @entity5 is the highest award for gallantry that a @entity9 and @entity168 can achieve			2
it was created in 1856 during the @entity169			0
courage that defies belief ... and why we owe them all a debt of gratitude by @entity0 help needed : the grave of @entity178 , pictured , is in need of renovation @entity181 , in general , and the @entity5 , in particular , have been two of my greatest passions for more than half a century			1
some of the supreme acts of courage carried out by our servicemen in order to have been awarded the vc – @entity9 and the @entity80 ’s most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy – simply defy belief			2
it was therefore with great disappointment and distress that i read in the @entity24 at the weekend that many of the graves of our war heroes have fallen into disrepair			1
the @entity204 in @entity205 , @entity206 – the cemetery containing the largest number of graves belonging to our @entity5 heroes – is a case in point , with some headstones unsteady , covered in grime and with their inscriptions barely readable			1
the plight of these graves has been highlighted by the @entity44 , a charity founded with the honourable aims to maintain memorials and graves commemorating the lives of holders of the @entity5			1
nearly 1,000 recipients of the @entity5 are buried in churchyards in the @entity9 and it is many of these graves that have fallen into a pitiable state ( whereas the @entity80 looks after the graves of 386 @entity5 recipients who fell in action abroad )			1
the concerns of the @entity44 have now been reinforced by the findings of the @entity60 , an influential think - tank which has called on the government to help provide an estimated £ 1.2million required to survey and restore the graves that have fallen into a state of disrepair			0
over the past three decades , i have championed bravery , building up the largest collection of vcs in the world – now on display to the public at a gallery in the @entity21 in @entity22			0
i have also written four books on gallantry : the first , @entity247 , was published to mark the 150th anniversary of the @entity5 being instituted by @entity249 in 1856			2
i feel protective towards the graves of those 177 men whose vcs are now in my collection			0
it is for this reason that i am today pledging up to £ 1,000 per plot to restore any of these specific graves if , for whatever reason , they have fallen into major disrepair			0
i hope that my pledge , so soon after @entity49 , will encourage others , including the @entity234 and concerned groups or individuals , to find the funds to restore every derelict grave of a @entity5 recipient to its former glory			2
crumbling : @entity178 was buried at @entity204 , close to his birthplace , after his death in may 1917 , aged 83 many families of fallen @entity5 heroes have tended the graves of their loved ones for several decades			1
however , it is often the medal recipients from the 19th century and the @entity137 whose graves are now in the greatest need of restoration			0
today ’s descendants of these recipients may not even be aware of the bravery of yesteryear or the whereabouts of their forebears ’ graves			2
until the @entity24 highlighted the case at the weekend , i was unaware that the grave of one of the @entity5 recipients whose medals i own is apparently in need of renovation			1
@entity178 was a gunner in the @entity295 when he was awarded the @entity5 in september 1882 for bravery in @entity297			1
he was serving on @entity298 during the @entity299 when the city of @entity301 was under bombardment from @entity9 warships			0
during the engagement , a ten - inch shell passed through the ship ’s side and lodged on the main deck			0
@entity178 , who had been below deck , raced to the scene of the danger as soon as he heard a shout that there was a live shell on board			0
without thinking of his own safety , he picked up the shell and threw it into a tub of water			0
this prevented the shell from exploding and claiming many lives			0
the brave actions of @entity178 , then 48 , were feted by his comrades and he was awarded the @entity5 just two months after the incident			1
he was buried at @entity204 , close to his birthplace , after his death in may 1917 , aged 83			0
if my inquiries now reveal that mr @entity178 ’s descendants are no longer able to care for his grave then , with the blessing of the family or relevant authority , i will make the necessary funding available to carry out restoration work			0
and i will do the same for other graves belonging to the recipients of medals in my collection if it is shown they have fallen into a state of disrepair			0
@entity342 , like gallantry medals , should be seen as a tangible relic of someone ’s courage			0
they should be considered as a tribute to someone who has risked , and in some cases given his life for his comrades , his sovereign or his country			0
as a nation , we owe every @entity5 recipient a debt of gratitude – and also a responsibility to care for that individual ’s final resting place for ever @entity361 is a @entity363 peer , businessmen and philanthropist			1
his latest book , @entity367 , is published by @entity368			0
anyone wishing to help the @entity44 , should visit : @entity370			0
