among the intimate revelations — descriptions of @entity5 ’s spiritual nature and how deeply affected he was by @entity48 — was the disclosure that @entity9 had been just 14 when she met @entity5			1
@entity9 says the two met at a @entity54 , @entity53 @entity52 hotel			1
‘ i was sitting at a pool , i was reading @entity56			0
and he said , “ how is @entity57 ? " ’ despite warnings from her mother , @entity9 continued the relationship , which consisted of long walks on the beach and the exchange of many letters			1
for five years , the friendship blossomed			0
then , the two had sex for the first time and @entity9 would only see @entity5 once more for the rest of her life			1
‘ i saw this glass curtain come down , and i just knew it was all over , ’ she said			1
but she still remembers him fondly			0
‘ he wanted to go below the surface of your life , ’ @entity9 said			1
‘ @entity76 would say to me , a young girl , “ do you believe in @entity79 ? ” no adult had ever talked to me [ like that ]			0
not only that , no adult had ever listened to me			0
‘ he once said to me , “ if you ever lose track of me , just read my stories			0
" ’ the authors of a new @entity5 biography are claiming they have cracked one of publishing 's greatest mysteries : what ' @entity93 ' novelist was working on during the last half century of his life			1
@entity9 was just 14 when she began her relationship with the secretive @entity5 letters : pictured is an excerpt from one of dozens of letters @entity5 exchanged with @entity9 , a woman who would a model for the title character in his story for @entity106 questionable ? @entity9 revealed she was just 14 when she first met @entity5 and that the last time she saw him was after the first time they had sex 5 years later the new book and related film will be released next week and they both claim that the novelist instructed his estate to release at least five new books			1
some of the work is brand - new , while other volumes extend existing stories and characters			0
starting between 2015 and 2020 , a series of posthumous @entity5 releases are planned , according to @entity5 , co-written by @entity123 and @entity13 and scheduled to be published sept. 3			1
@entity42 's documentary on the author opens sept. 6			0
in january , it will air on @entity127 as an installment of ' @entity129			0
' providing by far the most detailed report of previously unreleased material , the book 's authors cite ' two independent and separate sources ' who they say have ' documented and verified ' the information			0
one of the @entity5 books would center on catcher protagonist @entity138 and his family , including a revised version of an early , unpublished story @entity143			1
other volumes would draw on @entity5 's @entity48 years and his immersion in eastern religion			1
a publication called @entity148 would feature additional stories about the @entity140 of @entity150 and other @entity5 works			1
@entity5 does not identify a prospective publisher			1
spokesman @entity152 of @entity153 , which released catcher and @entity5 's three other books , declined to comment sunday			1
@entity5 's son , @entity156 , who helps run the author 's literary estate , was not immediately available for comment			1
if the books do appear , they may well not be through @entity153			0
but after news leaked of the planned publication , @entity5 changed his mind and @entity176 was canceled			2
no @entity5 book came out after the early 1960s , as the author increasingly withdrew from public life			2
over the past 50 years , there has been endless and conflicting speculation over what @entity5 had been doing during his self - imposed retirement			1
that @entity5 continued to write is well documented			2
friends , neighbors and family members all reported that @entity5 was writing in his final years and the author himself told the @entity188 in 1974 that he wrote daily , though only for himself			1
' there is a marvelous peace in not publishing , ' he said at the time			0
but there is no consensus on what he was writing and no physical evidence of what @entity5 had reportedly stashed in a safe in his home in @entity199 , @entity200 the @entity5 estate , run partly by @entity156 and @entity5 's widow , @entity202 , has remained silent on the subject since the author 's death in january 2010			2
excitement : this billboard for the new film appeared on the @entity208 the two did not cooperate with @entity42 and @entity123			0
until now , neither @entity42 nor @entity123 has been defined by his expertise on @entity5			2
@entity42 is a @entity211 screenwriter whose credits include @entity213 , the @entity216 film @entity214 and a planned sequel to @entity219 's blockbuster @entity218			0
@entity123 is an award - winning author whose books include the novel dead languages ; a nonfiction work on pro basketball that was a @entity225 prize finalist ; and @entity226 , a self - described ' manifesto ' for modern literature			0
their 700 - page @entity5 biography has new information well beyond any possible posthumous fiction			2
nine years in the making and thoroughly documented , @entity5 features many rare photographs and letters , unprecedented detail about the author 's @entity48 years and brief first marriage , and a revelatory interview with the former teenage girl , @entity9 , who inspired his classic story for @entity241			1
it also has an account of how @entity5 , who supposedly shunned @entity211 for much of his life , nearly agreed to allow @entity241 to be adapted into a feature film			2
@entity5 both fleshes out and challenges aspects of the author 's legend			2
he is portrayed as deeply traumatized by his war experiences and stunned by his post- ' catcher ' fame			0
but he also comes off as far less reclusive and detached than long believed			0
he does agree to the occasional interview , even initiating discussion with the @entity188 , and appears sensitive to his public image			0
his affinity for young people is not confined to his books , and @entity5 's biographers closely track his history of intense attachments to teens , from @entity262 in the 1940s to @entity264 in the 1970s			2
the book is structured as an oral history , featuring hundreds of new and old interviews , excerpts from newspaper accounts and previous biographies and commentary from @entity123 and @entity42			0
those quoted range from @entity5 's children to authors @entity274 and @entity276 to @entity277 , who cited catcher as a reason he murdered @entity280 in 1980			2
@entity42 has been promising to make headlines ever since announcing the biography and film shortly after @entity5 's death			2
earlier this year , he quickly arranged lucrative deals with the @entity286 for a feature film , the producers of ' american masters ' for tv rights and @entity291 for the book			0
the filmmaker himself has proved as effective as @entity5 at keeping a secret , with only a handful of people even knowing of the project 's existence during @entity5 's lifetime			2
fame : @entity5 was an international celebrity before becoming reclusive @entity42 spent some $ 2 million of his own money and traveled throughout the @entity303 and @entity304 in search of material			0
he is also adept at revealing secrets , with recent stories by @entity0 and other media outlets , featuring photographs never previously published			0
@entity5 never authorized a biography , but several unauthorized books have come out over the past 30 years , notably one by @entity313			1
in 1987 , @entity5 successfully blocked release of @entity313 's ' @entity5 : a writer 's life , ' citing the use of previously unpublished letters			0
@entity313 described his legal battle in ' searching for @entity5 , ' published in 1988 .			0

@entity9 met @entity5 in @entity54 , @entity53 when she was 14 years old and the relationship lasted five years
