by @entity0 last updated at 8:26 am on 6th december 2011 ski companies let out a collective sigh of relief as up to 30cm of snow finally fell across @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 today after what had been a worryingly mild start to the season			1
in @entity5 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all received fresh dumps of snow with @entity16 reporting a fall of 20cm			2
and it is hoped that the snow will continue to fall with a number of @entity5 resorts expecting to receive anything between 10cm to 40cm of snowfall later this week			1
at last ! a thick blanket of snow covers the slopes of @entity5 ski resort @entity16 today which reported a fall of as much as 20cm barren : the slopes of @entity16 , seen here just four days ago , had been badly affected by the warmest and driest autumn in the @entity29 for 147 years in @entity6 , it was snowing in both @entity31 and @entity32 , which allowed riders on their slopes for the first time last weekend			1
@entity36 had 5cm of fresh snow and @entity38 received 10cm of fresh snow			0
@entity40 also had a good day on monday , and received one of the highest amounts of fresh snow in @entity6 with around 30cm			1
in @entity7 , @entity43 reported a fall of 10cm of fresh snow today and has 15 out of 24 ski lifts open			1
@entity46 fared less well with 5cm of snow and only four out of its 84 lifts open and @entity50 had just 3cm of snow with only two out of its 84 lifts open			0
resorts in @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 are yet to open for the season			1
shining brightly : the slopes are now ready for ski season at @entity16 as this glorious picture shows dusted : the slopes at @entity5 resort @entity13 , which is due to host the @entity65 alpine races later this month , look far healthier now that 's more like it : the town of @entity16 as it should look at this time of year @entity69 of the @entity70 told @entity71 : ‘ there ’s great news in numerous @entity75 resorts who finally , after weeks of dry , warm conditions , have received anything between a light dusting and 30cm of the white stuff			1
time to take off : a sign at @entity82 ‘ resort villages have been transformed from green to white overnight and the forecast implies more snow is on the way			2
' this has been a great confidence booster and could be the first signs of what could turn out to be a fantastic winter season			0
’ @entity75 has been experiencing its warmest and driest autumn since 1864 , meaning many @entity75 ski resorts had been forced to delay openings due to a shortage of snow , which was threatening to ruin pre-christmas skiing holidays for thousands of @entity97			0
resorts in @entity5 and @entity6 had been particularly badly hit			1
nine out of 12 @entity5 ski resorts had to delay their openings , including the @entity102 at @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			1
in the @entity110 , only two out of 36 resorts - @entity108 and @entity109 – had opened by the end of last week			0
@entity16 and @entity12 in @entity5 , along with @entity38 in @entity6 and @entity112 in @entity7 , had managed to open on schedule with around 20 per cent of their pistes , but others had to postpone their opening days			1
@entity65 races scheduled for @entity16 that normally mark the beginning of the @entity75 ski season had to be moved to @entity120 in @entity121			0
this time last year , pistes across @entity5 - where most @entity97 @entity124 sports enthusiasts go - were almost all open			1
slope hope : a view from another part of @entity16			0
@entity65 races scheduled for the @entity5 resort that normally mark the beginning of the @entity75 ski season had to be moved to @entity120 in @entity121 of the 36 resorts on the other side of @entity5 - in the @entity110 - only two , @entity133 and @entity109 , is open			1
it is the same in @entity6 , where canons are working overtime to produce fake snow at @entity137 , where only a handful of runs on two out of five mountains have opened			2
last week the @entity5 resort of @entity16 was forced to abandon the event , due to take place on december 10 and 11 , because of the balmy autumn which has this year beleaguered the continent			2
@entity146 , a spokesman for the resort , which is popular with both @entity149 and chancellor @entity150 , said : ' it was the driest november here for 150 years , since records began			0
' @entity65 alpine races at @entity29 ski resort are scheduled for later this month but may still be cancelled due to lack of snow although snowfalls and lower temperatures are expected later this week , a spokesman for weather institute @entity158 said an ' exceptionally warm and extremely dry ' november included temperatures @entity161 above normal			0
this has meant that december - traditionally a busy period on the slopes when many families try and use the holidays to ski and snowboard - could be a wipe out			0
@entity169 joke : just nine out of 12 resorts in @entity5 have currently yet to even start their season			1
with government austerity measures biting in the @entity97 , the @entity5 fear a lack of spare cash will combine with the poor weather to stop people travelling for last - minute breaks too			2
in the meantime , those who have already booked will be checking travel insurance policies to see if they are entitled to compensation because of the lack of snow			0
most policies pay out nominal fee if there is no snow , but only if every ski lift is shut down			0
resorts are known to keep one lift open at all times , no matter how poor the snow cover , to stop this happening			2
some 400,000 @entity97 people travel to @entity5 to ski every season , with 250,000 heading for @entity7 , and 150,000 to @entity197			1
only around 75,000 go to @entity6 , but these tend to be richer holidaymakers , making the market an extremely lucrative one			0
if conditions stay as they are , then many of them are expected to switch to skiing holidays in the @entity203 , where conditions are currently far better than in @entity75			0
despite the gloom , a spokeswoman for the @entity70 , said : ' there is a lack of snow cover lower down in the @entity210 but snow is forecast over the coming weeks and this should dramatically improve conditions			0
slopes which are normally thick with snow at this time of year have been barren and brown due to the snow shortage			2

up to 30cm finally falls over @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7
slopes were worryingly green just a few days ago
just nine out of 12 @entity5 resorts had been open *ahead* of *festive* season
@entity225 across @entity5 were almost all open this time last year
