an expat could n't bear to miss his @entity2 curry - so he shipped it from @entity4 to @entity5			0
@entity6 , 63 , who emigrated from @entity7 to @entity8 with wife @entity9 ten years ago , stunned staff at @entity11 in @entity12 , when he asked for a doggy bag after spending £ 105 on a meal			1
when they asked where he was off to , mr @entity6 replied , ' back home to @entity5 ' - over 300 miles away			1
' when we lived in the @entity4 our favourite type of food was always @entity23 cuisine and , although there are some @entity23 restaurants in @entity5 , the quality of food is nowhere near as good as in @entity35			1
' mr @entity6 said when visiting the @entity4 he and his wife ' never miss the opportunity ' to have @entity23 food			1
and @entity2 is no exception : ' instead of turkey and all the trimmings , we go for curry			0
one of the couple 's sons lives in @entity44 , so mr @entity6 booked an early morning ferry and met him for a pre-christmas meal			2
mr @entity19 said the restaurant delivers food to ' all sorts of places and for a variety of occasions ' , but this was the first time their food had travelled so far but instead of trying to keep the meal warm , mr @entity6 packed it in a large cool bag for his overnight return trip to @entity60			2
he said the food arrived back in @entity5 ' without a hitch ' , and is now sitting in the freezer waiting for @entity2			0
@entity19 , who runs @entity11 with his dad @entity64 and brother @entity65 , said the restaurant delivers food to ' all sorts of places and for a variety of occasions ' , but this was the first time their food had travelled so far			0
he said : ' this is the first time we have ever had anyone take their takeaway to another country before - and for @entity2 as well			0

@entity6 emigrated to @entity8 with his wife @entity9 ten years ago
but the quality of the @entity23 food in @entity5 is ' nowhere near as good '
so mr @entity6 bought over £ 100 of food and took it home in a doggy bag
