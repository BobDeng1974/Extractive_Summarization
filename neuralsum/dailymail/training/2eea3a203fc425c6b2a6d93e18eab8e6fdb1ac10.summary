@entity1 assemblywoman @entity0 has drawn criticism over a comment about concealed weapon permits			1
the @entity6 @entity5 came under fire from @entity9 leaders and women 's groups after she was quoted in the @entity12 as saying ' hot little girls ' need concealed weapons to defend themselves from rapists			1
' if these young , hot little girls on campus have a firearm , i wonder how many men will want to assault them , ' @entity17 told the newspaper			0
' speaking her mind : assembly woman @entity0 , a conservative @entity6 @entity5 , talked about her bill that would allow people with concealed weapons permits to carry firearms on @entity1 campuses @entity32 : @entity17 is the main sponsor of a bill introduced last week that would allow people with concealed weapons permits to take their firearms onto the state 's college campuses @entity38 : @entity17 said assaults would decrease once sexual predators got bullets in their heads ' the sexual assaults that are occurring would go down once these sexual predators get a bullet in their head			1
' the @entity1 women 's lobby and democratic assembly minority leader @entity47 issued statements against @entity17 's comments , calling them unrepresentative of rape victims and objectifying of women			1
@entity17 did n't back down from her statement and said on her website that the quote was not the most ' eloquent ' but she still stood by the sentiment behind it			2
' that may not be the most eloquent way to phrase it , ' she acknowledged in a statement released on wednesday afternoon			0
' however , i stand wholeheartedly by that sentiment because i want every citizen , whether they 're on a college campus or not , to have the right to defend him or herself from sexual assault			0
' different approach : gun control advocates have linked the push to allow concealed carry based on a sexual assault prevention justification with the firearms industry 's recent attempts to appeal more broadly to women outspoken : ms. @entity0 of @entity1 , predicts the @entity5 - controlled @entity77 and @entity5 governor would enact her bill which will allow guns to be carried on campus @entity17 is a fierce supporter of gun rights who has referred to herself as a ' conservative , @entity84 , gun - toting , second amendment , strong - ass woman ' and as ' someone that carries a firearm on me like my panties and bra			1
' she has acknowledged that she carries her firearm even in gun - free zones			0
gun enthusiasts recently attempted to capitalize on the recent attention over the numbers of sexual assaults on college campuses to push their agenda			2
the gun lobby is increasingly trying to appeal to women and one of the ways they have been doing so recently is by telling women to take steps to prevent their own rapes			0
' the gun lobby has seized on this tactic , this subject of sexual assault			0
it resonates with lawmakers , ' @entity114 , the executive director of the campaign to keep @entity116 , told the @entity12 in the same article that included @entity17 's comments			2
university presidents , college students , and domestic violence experts are all opposed to the idea of allowing concealed weapons on school grounds .			1

on her website , @entity17 was *non-apologetic* and *reaffirmed* her comments
@entity17 is the main sponsor of a bill that would allow people with concealed weapons permits to take their firearms onto campuses
