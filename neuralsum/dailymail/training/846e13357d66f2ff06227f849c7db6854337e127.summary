' shooting : in @entity20 , @entity21 , amateur observers snapped beautiful pics of the @entity23 before dawn the best nights to view the @entity27 meteor shower , pictured , will be 17 and 20 november budding astronomers could see between 10 and 15 bright meteors an hour as the shower reaches its peak star gazers should not concentrate on the area around constellation @entity34 but keep their eyes moving across the sky			1
the best time to look for the @entity27 meteors will be after midnight			2
it is thought to be the best time to watch out for shooting stars @entity23 move around the sun in the direction opposite to that of @entity44 so they slam into our atmosphere almost head - on			1
