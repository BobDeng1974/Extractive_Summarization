by @entity0 published : 19:31 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 02:51 est , 28 march 2013 a black and yellow arrow is the vivid symbol of the @entity3			0
you will see it on flags flying over refugee camps from the @entity9 borders to the @entity10			0
yet it was the poison - tipped missile that thudded between @entity13 ’s shoulder blades at the @entity15 leadership election which most informs his decision to abandon @entity18 politics for a place among @entity21 ’s glamorous charity elite			1
younger brother @entity22 was the deceptively geeky assassin with the bow			1
he snatched the job @entity25 thought was his birthright			1
' took it personally ' : @entity25 's wife @entity13 , left , believed @entity22 's wife @entity28 , right , should have done the right thing and put a stop to his efforts to become leader of the @entity33 the sight of the two @entity36 - raised @entity15 apparatchiks engaged in political fratricide was astonishing , and in the subsequent two - and - a - half years , no amount of fine public words or behind - the - scenes finessing has healed that wound			1
forget @entity22 ’s almost tear - stained eulogies yesterday at the news his brother was leaving @entity18 politics ; forget mentor @entity47 ’s hope that ‘ this is time out , not time over ’ ; forget the $ 450,000 salary the @entity50 was predicting for the new @entity3 boss ; set aside even @entity13 ’s own part - explanation that he was repaying a debt to an organisation formed in the 1930s to help people like his parents flee @entity59 persecution			1
home ties : @entity13 's wife @entity61 is @entity62 and their two children were adopted in the @entity65 for the 47 - year - old former foreign secretary and one - time no 10 hopeful , a new life along the @entity67 rather than the @entity68 is about escaping @entity69 was n’t enough – only an ocean apart would do			1
in an interview with the @entity74 yesterday , he hinted at this when he said it was ‘ hard for me to accept that i can best help the @entity33 by giving not just the space between the front bench and the back bench to @entity22 , but the space between the front bench and 3,000 miles away ’			1
he went on : ‘ i want it to be the vision @entity22 has versus the vision @entity85 has			2
i did n’t want to become a distraction			0
i did n’t want the soap opera to take over the real substance of what needs to be done			0
’ one @entity69 source used rather blunter language : ‘ he will never come back			2
’ another added : ‘ he knows in his heart of hearts he is finished here			0
’ so ends serious recent speculation that the fraternal schism could be healed for the good of the party , with the more experienced and charismatic @entity13 brother returning to the @entity100 to turn a strong position into a winning one at the next general election			1
according to several @entity69 insiders , @entity13 ’s decision was vigorously encouraged by his musician wife @entity13			1
she is an @entity62 and their two children were both adopted in the @entity65			0
but the most telling factor is her continued bitterness at the way in which her husband was ‘ betrayed ’ by his little brother			1
‘ the relationship between the two brothers has never really recovered , but the driving force is @entity25 ’s wife @entity13 , ’ an associate of @entity25 ’s said			1
‘ she took it personally , and has not come to terms with it even slightly			0
why should @entity25 go back into the @entity100 and improve things for @entity22 ? ‘ @entity13 feels that @entity22 ’s wife @entity28 should have done the right thing and stopped her husband			1
@entity13 wants to get right out of the political “ @entity36 mafia ” set from which the brothers emerged , and @entity21 is also a good base for her own orchestral work			2
’ and so the discord continues , giving the lie to @entity22 ’s statement when he stood for the leadership that ‘ @entity25 is my best friend in the world			1
i love him dearly but win or lose we will remain the best of friends ’			0
wrong ! ‘ heartbroken ’ both by the dashing of his ambitions and the person behind it , @entity25 stepped down from front - rank politics			2
in his resignation statement , he said he had done it to ‘ give @entity22 the space ... he needed to lead the party without distraction ’			2
discord : @entity25 said he had quit politics to give his brother @entity22 , right , ' space ' to lead the @entity33 it had done little to soothe his feelings to hear the victorious @entity22 declare that @entity18 had not ‘ heard the last ’ of @entity25 , and that he would be ‘ around in one way or another ’			1
like @entity155 ’s ghost at the feast , it seemed			0
the lasting damage became clear with the publication of the first biography of the new leader , @entity22 : the @entity162 and the @entity161			2
written by two left - wing writers , it was an uncompromising picture of the schism which made uncomfortable reading for all concerned			0
among the book ’s revelations was that @entity25 ’s wife had cut @entity170 when they met behind the scenes following his unexpected victory			1
the book also suggested that the brothers ’ mother , @entity175 , was ‘ devastated ’ by the rift and wished she had persuaded her younger son not to have stood			0
and the brothers , who once spoke several times a week , largely communicated through their offices			0
there were also revelations about the smears – @entity22 was dubbed a ‘ @entity184 ’ , ‘ @entity22 ’ and ‘ @entity187 ’ – supporters of both brothers waged in the run - up to the ballot			2
there was a public coming together for @entity22 ’s marriage to lawyer @entity28 in may 2011			1
then @entity25 tweeted : ‘ great day for @entity22 and @entity28			1
they look very happy – congratulations from all the @entity162			0
’ tellingly , though , @entity25 and @entity13 did not attend the reception at @entity22 ’s north @entity197 home			1
but if @entity25 was devastated at this political assassination , he discovered that having more time on his hands could be lucrative			2
he embarked on the international lecture circuit , and took on ‘ advisory ’ roles , earning £ 70,000 for three - and - a - half days work with a @entity203 eco-technology company			0
and even as his brother struggled to impose a credible leadership , there were signs that the @entity13 camp was still manoeuvring for position			1
leaks to the @entity211 , which had supported @entity25 ’s leadership bid , were a clear sign – such as the publication of emails which showed that the two @entity216 , had plotted to oust @entity47 after @entity15 ’s 2005 election victory			2
while @entity25 told @entity219 he no longer dreamed of being prime minister , his supporters privately suggested that he was biding his time			2
unlike @entity22 , he would not throw down a direct challenge to a brother			1
but he would step in if other forces conspired to ensure that @entity22 lost the leadership			2
brothers at war : the first autobiography of @entity22 made for uncomfortable reading today , with the @entity231 in some disarray and @entity15 with a double - figure lead in the polls , that eventuality seems more unlikely			2
as one ally said yesterday : ‘ @entity25 does not want to stand still any longer			2
’ of course @entity237 ’s departure represents more than simply the end of his own ambitions here			0
some have called it the final curtain on the @entity15 project			0
as one insider said : ‘ @entity247 corpse was just about twitching with @entity13 still around on the back benches , but that ’s the end of it now			1
’ what ’s left , of course , is a @entity33 ever more in hock to the unions , and with policies that seem designed to drag it away from the centre ground			0
so could @entity25 still have enough of a passion for politics to return from @entity62 and throw down the gauntlet once more ? ‘ it would be too weird for one @entity13 to take over from another , ’ says the source			1
‘ it would make @entity15 look like @entity264			0
and you have to remember that @entity13 is older than @entity85			0
‘ anyway , he is sick of the whole soap opera , psycho - drama that a minor role in @entity18 politics brings			0
i never thought he would stay until the next election			0
a former foreign secretary as back bench mp for @entity275 ? i do n’t think so			1
’ and so the future lies westwards			0
like @entity47 before him , @entity13 is using the contacts he made in his former life to forge a lucrative future			0
one in which he might still wield real power			0
‘ everyone thinks the @entity284 sorted his new job for him , and you would think @entity25 will be heavily involved in @entity288 ’s presidential election campaign in 2016 , ’ said another @entity69 source			1
‘ she and @entity25 had a real chemistry when he was foreign secretary			1
she admitted she had a crush on him and could end up giving him an important job			0
‘ what price @entity13 in a senior role in the @entity295 and @entity22 in no 10 ? stranger things have happened in politics			1
’ but none that come quickly to mind			0
a new chapter in the @entity13 story begins , but the sibling rivalry continues unabated .			0
