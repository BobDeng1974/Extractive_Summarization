thirty years ago this month something as basic as two men hitting balls around a table with a stick gripped the nation by the throat			2
it was as iconic a moment of the @entity9 as @entity10 , yuppies , football hooliganism and @entity13 handbagging the unions			0
it was @entity16 — lean , robotic and unsmiling — versus @entity17 — tubby and splendidly bespectacled			1
‘ and so the lights go down , ’ whispered commentator @entity18 to 18.5million viewers			1
‘ the players shake hands			0
one of these lucky chaps will pick up the title , the trophy and £ 60,000			0
’ @entity16 ( left ) and @entity17 pose with the trophy before their @entity27 final in 1985 @entity16 was leading the final 8 - 0 when he missed a shot on the green that he has rued to this day @entity17 pounced upon the error from @entity16 to overturn the difference and lead 9 - 7 overnight the 1985 final was watched by 18.5million , a @entity34 record , but it is way behind the most - watched sporting events : 1			1
1966 @entity38 final 32.30m 2			2
1970 fa cup final replay @entity39 v @entity40 28.49m 3			2
1984 @entity43 and @entity44 6			0
@entity47 @entity46 v @entity48 23.78m with those words the biggest @entity51 television audience for a post-midnight programme and @entity34 ’s biggest for anything ever , settled down to watch the 35th and final frame of the 1985 @entity55 , a torture of edgy , error - ridden , nerve - frayed snooker lasting 68 minutes			1
before reliving those late agonies , we should go back a little further because @entity16 remembers the turning point of the match not as the black he overcut with his last , disastrous shot of the tournament , but something as innocuous as a green ball in the ninth frame			1
he was leading 8 - 0 while @entity17 , as @entity16 put it , was ‘ struggling to find the end of his tip with the chalk , never mind the pockets ’			1
@entity16 says now : ‘ if ever i was going to have therapy , it would not be about the black			1
anybody could miss a ball under pressure			2
the green was a different story because i did n’t need to play it			0
i should have played safe and waited for a better chance			0
‘ if there is one shot in my whole career i want to go back and play again , it is that one			0
i missed it and it let @entity17 in			1
’ from being on the verge of 9 - 0 down , @entity17 fought back to 9 - 7 overnight			1
‘ i woke up screaming every hour , ’ recalls @entity16			1
he was the world no 1 , winner the previous two years , and had made the perfect start			0
‘ what could go wrong ? ’ he muses now			0
’ @entity17 performs his famous finger - wagging celebration after sinking the final black to rake up that final with @entity16 even now is to intrude into a type of personal grief			1
‘ while i am happy to talk about it , i ’m slightly aggrieved that nobody celebrated the 25th anniversary of me beating @entity105 18 - 3 in 1989 , ’ he says , three - quarters joking			1
‘ @entity17 loves it , of course			1
we say that every opportunity he gets in the commentary box he somehow manages to turn the conversation around to the ’ 85 final , even when we are discussing a free ball			1
’ @entity16 ’s lead went from 14 - 11 to 15 - 12 to 15 - 15 to 17 - 15			1
then all square at 17 - 17			1
@entity116 was in its heyday , with cartoon - book characters such as @entity120 and @entity121 putting it second only to football in national popularity and this frame was the zenith			0
@entity16 sipped his water sparingly throughout			1
@entity17 frequently muttered to his mother , who had died , aged 62 , a few months before			1
it provided him with a welcome distraction from watching @entity16 dominating the table			1
but the championship came down to the final four balls			0
he potted a great long brown , a difficult blue and a tricky pink			0
@entity17 went over to kiss the little lady on the trophy before taking on the black			1
@entity16 led again 14 - 11 but the pair were eventually all square at 17 - 17 in @entity143 the final came down to four balls left on the table and @entity17 needed them all to claim victory @entity17 looks to the trophy for inspiration before taking an important shot in the final against @entity16 @entity16 missed a black that seven out of ten times in competition he would have converted ‘ i do n’t know why i did it to this day , ’ he said			1
‘ i think it was either i am going to win you with this shot or lose you with it			0
i had made my mind up i was going to go for it			0
’ @entity17 tries to double the black into the middle pocket			1
‘ the crowd opposite the pocket were in a better position than me to see it and they started cheering , ’ says @entity17			1
‘ but it missed by a fraction			0
’ @entity16 then plays a superb safety shot , doubling the black from one end to the other			1
@entity17 tries to double it again , this time up and down the table			2
@entity16 fluffs his next shot and lets @entity17 in — a long black through the blue and green spots and his first genuine chance to take the title			1
‘ i twitched on it , ’ recalls @entity17			2
‘ it was the biggest twitch ever seen at the @entity185			0
my head came up and the cue jerked at it			0
i missed it by so much the black came back and i almost fluked it at the other end			2
’ now here was @entity16 ’s chance : a cut into the bottom corner pocket			2
‘ i walked away thinking there was no way he would miss it , ’ says @entity17			2
thirty years on , @entity16 reckons he would have potted this shot nine times out of 10 in practice and seven out of 10 in competition			2
‘ it was tough but gettable and i was meant to be the man who got everything , ’ he says			0
referee @entity207 calls for silence			0
‘ i remember that walk was surreal , an out - of - body experience			0
it did not feel as if any part of my anatomy was playing that shot			0
’ he crouches in total silence but overcuts the ball			0
@entity16 : ‘ i knew i ’d lost it at that moment			2
’ he put his hand to his head			0
the black he had left was straight forward			0
only nerves could cause @entity17 to flunk it			2
@entity17 , the underdog , was anecdotally most people ’s choice to win , though ironically it turned out that his future wife , @entity230 , was supporting @entity16 as she watched the match at home			1
@entity17 remembers : ‘ i could n’t believe i was coming back to the table			1
as i took the shot , i did n’t even grip the cue ; i let it rest in my hand , so i would have to let go of it and it would n’t deviate			0
’ it worked , and the black was sunk			0
@entity17 potted a straight forward black to win the final after 14 hours and 50 minutes of snooker @entity16 looks at the ground after losing the final he had never been behind in until the last ball hit the pocket @entity17 kisses the trophy after finally emerging victorious after his lengthy duel with @entity16 and so after 14 hours and 50 minutes of snooker , for every second of which @entity17 had been behind , he was the champion of the world			1
he held his cue aloft in both hands above his head and pumped it over his head			0
it was an ‘ i told you so gesture ’ aimed at his friend @entity262 , head of @entity264 , who had watched all but one session of @entity17 ’s entire championship campaign			2
it was 12.19am and time for bed			0
‘ interesting ’ by @entity16 is published by @entity269 , priced at £ 20 .			2
