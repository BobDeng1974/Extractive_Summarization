living near parks and green spaces in town and cities boosts your mental well - being			0
not only does moving to a greener area improves mental health , but the effect continues long after you have moved			1
the research by the @entity11 is one of the first studies to consider the effects of green space over time and its result could lead to town planners including green spaces in new developments			2
living near parks and green spaces in town and cities boosts your mental well - being the study traced participants over five years and used data from the @entity29 , information gathered from questionnaires filled in by households across @entity32			0
using data from more than 1,000 participants , the study focused on two groups of people , those who moved to greener urban areas and those who relocated to less green urban areas			2
on average movers to greener areas experienced an immediate improvement in mental health that was sustained for at least three years after they moved			1
the study , published in the journal of @entity47 , also showed that people relocating to more built up areas suffered a decline in mental health			1
interestingly this fall occurred before they moved and returning to normal once the move was complete			0
on average movers to greener areas experienced an immediate improvement in mental health the authors adjusted their data to remove effects from other factors likely to affect mental health over time - such as income , employment and education - as well as factors related to personality			1
dr @entity67 said : ' we 've shown that individuals who move to greener areas have significant and long - lasting improvements in mental health			1
' these findings are important for urban planners thinking about introducing new green spaces to our towns and cities , suggesting they could provide long term and sustained benefits for local communities			0
' in 2012 the @entity81 cited depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide , and this study builds on research that has found natural environments could act as vital resources to improve health and wellbeing			2
yet up until now , scientists have been unsure how these effects vary over time			0
co-author dr @entity93 added : ' we needed to answer important questions about how the effects of green space vary over time			0
' do people experience a novelty effect , enjoying the new green area after the move , but with the novelty then wearing off ? ' or do they take time to realise the benefits of their new surroundings as they gradually get to know local parks ? ' what we 've found suggests that the mental health benefits of green space are not only immediate , but sustainable over long periods of time			1
