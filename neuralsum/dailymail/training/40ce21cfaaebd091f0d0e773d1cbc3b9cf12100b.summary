getting a makeover : the 1,000,000th @entity0 , pictured on wednesday , is about to undergo pricey restoration after it was sucked into a sinkhole at @entity3 's @entity2 earlier this year flashback : the car was one of eight historic vehicles that fell into the 30ft sinkhole in february ( pictured ) on wednesday , @entity33 and @entity0 showed off the car at the special facility in @entity11 ahead of its restoration , which experts hope they can complete by next june			1
but it wo n't be an easy task - the 1992 car is just old enough that it will be hard to find or create replacement parts , @entity38 reported			2
it is estimated that the car suffered around $ 30,000 in damage			1
@entity33 will cover the cost of restoring the vehicle			0
expert restorers will also be forced to preserve as much as they can of the salvaged car so that it remains as true to its original form as possible to ' preserve as much authenticity as possible '			2
' the parts we have a choice on , we will always err on repairing them , ' @entity9 said , the @entity54 reported			0
challenge : the car , a 1992 model , suffered $ 30,000 worth of damage in the freak accident a look inside : the car 's windscreen was completely destroyed and it suffered broken lights and fenders the search is on : the car is just old enough that the team of 25 workers might struggle to find parts some work to do : @entity9 , the director of the @entity76 for @entity33 , is pictured beside the car , which will take around six months to complete the car , which is still covered in dirt and gravel , suffered heavy damage to its rear suspension and its front fender and the windshield was completely smashed			1
it also suffered a broken taillight on the rear of the car and the whole vehicle is covered in scratches			0
still , it went relatively unscathed compared to other vehicles that were reduced to metal skeletons			0
the car is also the most valuable of the three cars that can be saved			2
another , a 2009 @entity97 , was recently finished			0
a third vehicle that can be fixed , a 1962 black @entity0 , is too old for @entity33 to handle and will handpick a team of specialists to put it back together			1
five further cars were completely destroyed and can not be saved : a 1984 @entity103 pace car , a 1993 ruby red 40th anniversary @entity0 , a 2001 @entity105 , the 2009 white ' 1.5 millionth @entity106 ' and a 1993 @entity107			1
unbelievable : of the eight cars that fell into the sinkhole at the @entity3 museum , just three can be salvaged massive task : the sinkhole is now being filled and should be completed by july			1

as well as the restorations , a team is also working to fill the sinkhole in a $ 3.2 million project which is set to be completed by july			2
the hole opened up when the museum was closed , and no one was injured			0
and despite losing valuable cars , the museum has turned the freak accident into a money maker after a video of the incident was shared on @entity135 and viewed millions of times			0
the sinkhole became a popular attraction			0
people gawking at the hole revved up attendance and revenue at the museum , an hour north of @entity144 , @entity145			0

the hole will be filled completely with rock , then workers will drill into it to install steel casings , museum officials said			0
crews will pour grout into the casings , creating a steel and concrete pillar to provide additional support under the floor			0
the museum now plans to memorialize the sinkhole in exhibits			0
