by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 15 august 2012 updated : 19:02 est , 15 august 2012 family reunions can be rather awkward affairs			0
but these long - lost relatives were quick to break the ice in the warmest of ways – with a great big bear hug			0
@entity8 the gorilla and his younger brother @entity10 had been apart for nearly three years after being sent to different zoos			1
they were reunited this week in their new home in @entity15 and welcomed each other with open arms – followed by shoulder squeezes , handshakes and the odd bit of brotherly rough and tumble			2
embrace : @entity21 and @entity10 embrace give each other a hug after being reunited at @entity15 welcome : @entity8 is settling in well with his brother at the safari park the pair will now live together in a £ 3million enclosure at the @entity29 park			1
born at @entity31 , they were separated when @entity8 , 13 , was sent to @entity32 to take part in a breeding programme			1
he proved to be infertile , but while living with three females as the dominant male he became the leader of the pack – and transformed from a small blackback gorilla to a strapping great 35st silverback who towers over his nine - year - old brother			2
fortunately , this was n’t enough to stop @entity10 recognising him			2
gorillas , which share 98 per cent of their dna with humans , can identify each other by the shape of their noses			0
long time , no see : @entity8 and @entity10 shake hands after being brought together for the first time in years home : the brothers are kept in a £ 3million gorilla enclosure at the safari park @entity57 , head gorilla keeper at @entity58 , said : ' we were n’t entirely sure that the brothers would even know each other , but the moment they met you could just see the recognition in their eyes			1
' they were touching each other through the cage that temporarily separated them and there were no acts of aggression			0
' we put them together 24 hours later and it was like they had never been apart			0
' they were very animated and there was a lot of rough and tumble on the floor , but not in an aggressive way			0
' it is quite unusual to see that sort of childlike behaviour in a silverback			0
' mr @entity57 said that @entity8 was very tolerant and the gorillas had formed a ' really tight bond '			0
like old times : staff at the safari park say the gorillas are behaving as though they have never been apart family resemblance : the brothers were raised together at @entity31 , but became separated when @entity8 was chosen for a breeding programme he added : ' had they been two strangers there would have been a lot of face to face confrontation and some fighting and screaming			1
' but @entity8 and @entity10 were happy to turn their backs on one another which is a sign of trust			1
' it is great for @entity10 to have an older brother to look up to and learn from and @entity8 seems to enjoy being the centre of attention			1
' it was very satisfying to see			0
' the brothers were born at @entity31 but parted when @entity8 joined three females in @entity109			2
@entity58 has set up a ‘ bachelor group ’ of gorillas as there are too many males in the @entity113 breeding programme .			1

@entity8 the gorilla was separated from his brother @entity10 after he was chosen to take part in a breeding programme
but the brothers acted as if they had never been apart when they were reunited at @entity15 in @entity29
