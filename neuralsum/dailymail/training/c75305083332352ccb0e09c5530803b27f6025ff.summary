by @entity0 a three - story , professionally built treehouse is impressive even without a cool backstory			0
but the story of how one came to be at a summer camp in @entity6 is as heartwarming as it is impressive			0
@entity8 is about two hours outside of @entity9 and was the childhood getaway of @entity11			2
in 2004 , @entity11 and wife @entity12 bought the property , which previously @entity14			1
fancy : @entity16 turned a sick tree into a touching memorial to hear father touching : @entity12 's father hung a rope swing on an elm tree on the camp his daughter bought to christen the previously @entity26 summer camp @entity12 's father died shortly after she bought the camp - then the tree where he 'd hung the swing fell ill when the couple bought the property , @entity12 's father was ill , but he christened his daughter 's new camp by installing a rope swing on a giant @entity36 tree in the middle of the camp			1
sadly , @entity12 's father died 18 months later			1
then the young couple got some more bad news			0
' almost immediately after , we found out the tree had @entity43 elm disease , ' @entity12 tells @entity44			1
i could n’t cut that tree down			0
' luckily , the trunk of the tree was still strong even as the branches began dying			1
in an effort to keep the tree - and preserve the memory of @entity12 's father - they decided to someday build a treehouse around the remaining trunk			1
the couple went about cleaning up the rest of the camp , and put the treehouse plan on the back - burner for a while			2
not your average tree house : to preserve the tree - and the swing - @entity12 decided to turn build a tree house one day , @entity12 and friend @entity66 were talking about the camp and talked about turning it into an art camp for adults			1
they also talked about building the treehouse - and decided it was time to make it happen			0
@entity12 recruited @entity75 and @entity76 to help build it			2
' of course they chose a big healthy tree with a gorgeous green canopy , ' @entity12 told the magazine			1
. @entity12 , however , had other plans , and when she told the designers the story of her father 's elm , they agreed that was the tree for the treehouse			1
the designers wanted to go a bit bigger than @entity12 initially had planned , but that was fine with her			2
' everyone had a radically different idea , and everyone was thinking 100 times bigger and more elaborate than i was , ' she says			0
' i was imagining a little kid ’s house			0
the things they were coming up with were like castles in the sky			0
' go big or go home : designers @entity75 and @entity76 had big plans for the treehouse the impressive abode is three stories high and includes a wood - burning stove and an upstairs bedroom - and , of course , a swing the design they went with was a three - level cottage that has more bells and whistles than your average treehouse			2
of course , @entity12 's father 's swing remained on the tree - and she is grateful for the help she received			1
' it ’s rare to find folks so selfless that they would literally build you a cabin in the sky and ask for nothing in return , ' she says			0
' and these folks are n’t your average builders , but amazing , visionary designers			0
it ’s humbling beyond words			0

@entity12 and her *husband* bought @entity8 in 2004
@entity12 's father hung a swing on a large elm tree to christen the camp
he died shortly after *hanging* the swing
shortly after , the elm got sick but , luckily , the trunk was strong enough to survive
to *commemorate* her father , @entity12 turned the elm into an *incredible* treehouse
