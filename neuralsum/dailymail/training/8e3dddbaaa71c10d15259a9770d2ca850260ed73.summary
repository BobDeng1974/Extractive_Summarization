by @entity1 reporter published : 00:08 est , 8 june 2012 updated : 00:08 est , 8 june 2012 though most of @entity4 is likely looking forward to the summer recess , the @entity3 chairman offered a grim warning as the @entity8 - era tax cut expiration date looms			1
‘ if you all go on vacation , ’ @entity9 said , ‘ ( @entity12 is ) still going to happen , so it ’s important to be thinking about that and working with your colleagues to see how you might address that concern at the appropriate time			1
’ he spoke urgently of the @entity8 - era tax cuts that will cost taxpayers $ 130billion in increases if nothing is done to extend them			1
@entity23 warning : @entity24 chairman @entity9 warned @entity4 thursday to make a decision on the @entity8 - era tax cuts that are set to expire arms crossed : @entity9 is pictured before testifying at a @entity28 hearing on economic outlook and policy on @entity31 in @entity32 speaking at the @entity28 , @entity9 painted a grim warning			1
‘ if allowed to occur … ( it would ) pose a significant threat to the recovery , ’ he said			0
‘ if no action were taken and the fiscal cliff were to kick in its full size , i think it would be very likely that the economy would being to contract or possibly go even into recession			0
’ he also added that unemployment would again rise from its current high at 8.2 per cent			0
however , he said the @entity45 is prepared to take steps to boost the @entity48 economy if it weakens			1
but he said @entity45 officials still need to study the most recent economic trends , including job growth			1
for now , @entity9 said he foresees moderate growth this year			2
he said he 's mindful that all that could change , if @entity55 's crisis quickly worsened or @entity48 job growth stalled			0
' as always , the @entity3 remains prepared to take action as needed to protect the @entity48 financial system and economy in the event that financial stresses escalate , ' he told the @entity28			2
the @entity45 could buy more bonds to try to further reduce long - term interest rates , which might encourage more borrowing and spending			1
or it could extend its plan to keep short - term rates near zero beyond late 2014 until an even later date			2
do n't let it happen : he said that the tax cuts can not expire , as more unemployment and even another recession could result but most economists do n't expect a major announcement at the @entity45 's next policy meeting june 19 - 20 , despite signals this week from some other @entity45 members in favour of considering further action			1
for one thing , long - term @entity48 interest rates have already touched record lows			2
even if rates dropped further , analysts say they might provide little benefit for the economy			0
‘ if allowed to occur ( @entity88 ) would pose a significant threat to the recovery			0
if no action were taken and the fiscal cliff were to kick in its full size , i think it would be very likely that the economy would being to contract or possibly go even into recession			0
' they say it 's unlikely that many businesses and consumers who are n't borrowing now at super-low rates would do so if rates declined a bit more			0
and @entity9 could face pressure not to pursue further stimulus before the november election because such steps could be perceived as helping president @entity109 win re-election			2
' the @entity45 simulative effects have really run their course , ' @entity109 's @entity112 opponent , @entity111 , argued in a television interview last week			2
@entity118 and @entity119 , economists at @entity117 , said there was nothing in the testimony to ' tip @entity9 's hand ' before the june meeting of the @entity45 's policy committee			1
' yes , the @entity45 chairman said the @entity45 stands ready to act if @entity55 poses a threat to the @entity48 financial system or the economy , ' they wrote in a note to clients			1
' however , he gave no specifics			0
' an early rally on @entity135 faded after @entity9 signalled no immediate further steps from the @entity45 to help the economy			1
the @entity139 industrial average had been up as much as 140 points			0
it closed up about 46 points , or 0.3 per cent			0
presiding : @entity9 presides over a meeting of the @entity24 , from second left to right , federal reserve board of governors : @entity146 ; @entity147 ; @entity148 ; @entity149 ; @entity150 ; @entity151 many analysts are worried that the @entity48 economy is suffering a midyear slump just as in 2010 and 2011			2
they 're concerned in particular about the job market			0
from december through february , the economy added an average 252,000 jobs a month			0
but since then , job growth has slowed to a lacklustre 96,000 a month			0
in may , @entity48 employers added just 69,000 jobs - the fewest in a year			2
@entity9 said the @entity45 is still assessing the most recent employment data			1
like many economists , @entity9 suggested that a warm winter might have prompted some hiring that normally would have occurred later			2
that could have weakened hiring temporarily in the spring			0
if that 's true , hiring might bounce back			0
still , @entity9 said some of the winter hiring might have made up for excessive job cuts during the recession			1
if so , and if those companies have completed such ' catch - up ' hiring , then stronger economic growth might be needed to boost hiring , @entity9 said			1
' that is the essential question we will have to look at , ' he told the panel			0
the government said last week that the economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 1.9 per cent in the first three months of 2012			0
@entity180 , an economist at @entity181 , said he thought @entity9 did n't seem alarmed by the weak hiring in may			2
' his view is that it is n't a sign that the economy is falling apart , ' @entity180 said			0
options : the @entity45 could buy more bonds to try to further reduce long - term interest rates , or it could extend its plan to keep short - term rates near zero beyond late 2014 @entity9 's message to financial markets , @entity180 said , was , ' do n't expect anything drastic from the @entity45 at the june meeting			1
' that said , if the @entity45 does announce some new action at its meeting later this month , @entity180 said the most likely step would be to extend a program , known as @entity200 , that will expire at the end of june			1
under @entity200 , the @entity45 sells shorter - term securities and buys longer - term bonds			1
as with other @entity45 bond purchases , the idea has been to drive down long - term rates so that mortgages , auto loans and other consumer and business loans become more attractive			1
the @entity45 's policy committee has been split between those who favor doing everything possible to strengthen the economy and reduce unemployment , and those more concerned about inflation risks			2
on wednesday , @entity146 , the vice chairman of the @entity45 , @entity219 , the head of the @entity222 regional @entity221 , and @entity223 , president of the @entity45 bank , all suggested that the @entity45 might need to do more to provide support			1
but rep. @entity226 , @entity227 , warned at thursday 's hearing against more bond buying			0
he and other critics worry that ever - lower borrowing rates could eventually ignite inflation			0
' it is my belief that the @entity45 has done all that it can do and has perhaps done too much , ' said @entity226 , vice chairman of the committee .			1

chairman of the @entity45 @entity9 offered grim warning to @entity4 if they do nothing over bush - era tax cuts that will expire
will cost taxpayers $ 130billion in *additional* taxes if nothing is done
