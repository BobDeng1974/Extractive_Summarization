a neglectful family life and the sounds of daily domestic abuse soon led @entity3 into a downward spiral of self - harm			1
the @entity7 man was mistreated by his step - father for as long as he could remember , while his mother remained powerless against the man who beat her behind closed doors			1
' there were times when it was late at night and i 'd be woken up because of screaming , i could hear him beating my mum in the lounge , ' @entity3 told the @entity19			2
@entity3 , from @entity7 , was bullied by his step - father and neglected by his mother , eventually leading him to self - harm ' i just felt cowardice , there was nothing i could do about it			1
' only a teenager at the time , @entity3 sought to find affection in other places and became dependant on relationships			1
it was when he was between relationships , halfway through year 10 , that he turned to self - harm after seeing examples in blog posts			2
clearly deep in depression , @entity3 secluded himself to his room and began to cut himself regularly with blades where he hoped no one would notice the scars			0
' it was in a period between relationships			0
i was n't getting any affection there , i was n't getting any affection at home , and i felt like i had no feelings , so with self - harm i felt pain , ' @entity3 told the @entity19			1
his life was turned around however after a confrontation with his mother			2
' i was just sick of the way i was treated			0
i said like , ' mum you have to either get rid of him or me			0
' and she said , ' he gets home in about two hours , you 'd better be gone by then , ' he said			0
since that day , @entity3 has barely looked back			0
he moved in with his maternal grandmother after tracking her down and has since started an audio engineering course			0
although he 's had to temporarily leave the course behind and move on to full time work due to his grandfather being diagnosed with cancer , @entity3 leads a far happier life .			1

@entity3 was bullied by his *stepfather* and often heard him *violently* abusing his mother when he was growing up
he soon turned to self harm when he failed to find affection
the @entity7 man has since recovered and leads a *normal* life after leaving his home as a teenager
