it may have only been a matter of weeks since mayor of london @entity1 was left suspended precariously above the capital in a comical zip wire malfunction during the @entity5			1
but mr @entity1 could be looking to take to the skies once again , this time on his bike , as he considers an architect 's proposals for a network of elevated cycle paths between @entity13 's mainline stations			2
spectacular artist 's impressions of what the city 's raised cycle network - given a working name of @entity20 - could look like were released this week along with the first details of the project			1
an artist 's impression is shown the scheme is designed to make cycling safer for the increasing numbers choosing to take their bike to work drawings showing a futuristic raised glass open - top tunnel , that have drawn comparisons with @entity40 's @entity39 , could become a reality as soon as 2015			1
@entity25 , 43 , the landscape architect who came up with the idea with a colleague two years ago , said discussions between the mayor and @entity46 were ' going well ' since an initial meeting in may and that feasibility studies over potential sites were already underway			2
he stressed that plans were at an early stage , but the proposal was focused on commuters who would pay to use the network with an oyster card			1
@entity20 could become a reality above the streets of @entity13 as soon as 2015 mr @entity25 , director of @entity58 , who admits to giving up cycling in @entity13 because he found it too dangerous added that the raised network was the only option left to expand cycling in @entity13			1
he said : ' @entity65 estimate the number of journeys made by bike will treble to around 1.5 million by 2020			2
where are they meant to go ? @entity20 is the next logical step , because you ca n’t realistically build more cycle lanes on ground level			1
' you have to start knocking down buildings and there will always be the problem of traffic			2
it will be less safe than it is now and you ca n’t persuade people to get on bikes as it is even if you keep raising taxes on cars			2
' he added : ' @entity1 loves the idea and @entity46 are really positive about it			0
i sincerely believe it could be the next significant piece of @entity13 infrastructure and would transform the capital			0
' it has been compared to @entity40 ’s @entity39 , which i am familiar with , but the reality is this is a completely different concept			0
' in @entity40 it is mainly pedestrian and primarily for tourists and uses converted disused railway lines			0
@entity1 , right , is considering architect @entity25 's ambitious @entity20 design ' we are talking about new infrastructure for commuters that guarantees safety and will be quicker than taking public transport			1
it is a much more ambitious and expensive			0
' the drawings show a bold red and blue design incorporating a helix structure partly encasing the raised platform above @entity13			0
@entity25 believes that a corporate sponsor similar to the @entity112 - backed cycle hire scheme would be needed to help fund the project , which he said would cost ' tens of millions of pounds ' and take around two years to build			1
it is thought the first route could be built on the @entity5 regeneration of east @entity13 , linking @entity117 with the @entity118 through @entity119 and @entity121 stations but this has yet to be confirmed it is envisaged that cyclists could pay around £ 1 per journey , making it significantly cheaper to use than public transport - around the third of the cost of a regular commute			1
@entity25 , 43 , hopes that his design will make @entity13 safer for cyclists there would also be the need for more cycle storage and ramps at stations			0
despite suggestions , @entity25 said the proposed network would not exclusively use old railway lines but would require new infrastructure build alongside or above tracks in some places			0
the problem of negotiating with different landowners is to be overcome by using leasing land owned by @entity46			0
the @entity20 idea has drawn comparisons with @entity40 's @entity39 , pictured , which uses the city 's old railway lines as walkways speaking about the idea recently @entity1 mp described it as ' very interesting '			1
he said : ' there is a proposal , which is very interesting , to hook up mainline stations in @entity13 along the side of raised railway tracks , with a new cycle path			0
' according to @entity65 , there were twice the number of cyclists in @entity13 in 2010 compared to 2000 , sparking numerous campaigns for improvements to make cycling safer in the capital .			0

first phase of @entity20 would link @entity117 with @entity118 by 2015
commuters expected to pay £ 1 per journey
scheme could cost ' tens of millions of pounds '
