controversial : father @entity0 posted the bulletin ' women and femicide - healthy self - criticism			1
how often do they provoke ? ' on the church door an @entity6 priest has provoked outrage after claiming that women are to blame for domestic violence by wearing tight clothing in his @entity12 bulletin - and pinning the notice to the door his church			1
father @entity0 also attacked women for not cleaning their houses and serving fast food , and called on women to engage in ' healthy self criticism ' over femicide - men murdering women			1
in an astonishing message , he attacked pornography but said women shared the blame for ' provoking the worst instincts which then turn into violence and sexual abuse '			2
father @entity0 's letter , pinned to the door of the church in the northern village of @entity35 , said : ' let 's ask ourselves			1
is it possible that men have all gone mad at one stroke ? we do n't think so			2
' the core of the problem is in the fact that women are more and more provocative , they yield to arrogance , they believe they can do everything themselves and they end up exacerbating tensions , ' it said			1
' how often do we see girls and even mature women walking on the streets in provocative and tight clothing ? ' babies left to themselves , dirty houses , cold meals and fast food at home , soiled clothes			1
' so if a family ends up in a mess and turns into crime ( a form of violence which should be condemned and punished firmly ) often the responsibility is shared , ' it said			2
the mayor of @entity73 , @entity74 , said the article was ' astonishing and deeply offensive '			0
a @entity92 report found that one third of women in @entity6 had reported being a victim of serious domestic violence and in 2010 127 women were murdered by men			1
they were often as a result of ' honour , men 's unemployment and jealousy by the perpetrator			0
' amid protests from women ’s rights and anti-violence campaigners , @entity106 was widely reported by @entity6 media to have apologised to his congregation and handed in his resignation			2
however , he later denied the reports , saying a resignation letter sent to news agencies was ' probably a fake ' , according to @entity117			0
he was quoted as saying he will ' take a rest ' but had no intention of stepping down			0
anger : after father @entity0 posted the letter on the door of @entity124 ( pictured ) , the bishop of @entity85 ordered that it be taken down father @entity0 added in his letter posted on the church 's door ( pictured ) that women are ' provocative ' and that they ' end up exacerbating tenstions ' accusation : father @entity0 later accused a journalist of being gay for refusing to talk about naked pictures of women he also asked a reporter for @entity135 : ' i do n’t know whether you ’re a queer or not , but what do you feel when you see a naked women ? ' are women themselves not causing harm by unveiling themselves like this ? ' , he was quoted as saying in @entity117			1
@entity145 , the head of @entity147 , an association that helps the victims of violence , said an was not sufficient			0
she told @entity152 television : ' i thank the bishop who had the paper taken down but i 'm still not satisfied because i think someone needs to talk to this person and understand why he has these attitudes			0
' i think he needs to make a deeper examination of his conscience that goes beyond apologies			0
' following protests he told weekly newspaper @entity164 : ' after everything that 's happened , which has certainly been well beyond what i intended or expected , i think there 's need for calm , rest and silence to respond with the serenity and harmony required to carry on			0
' now watch the video			0
