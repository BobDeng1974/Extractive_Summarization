by @entity0 a school has come under fire after asking parents to spend up to £ 400 on an @entity4 for lessons			1
@entity6 , in @entity7 , @entity8 , sent a letter home ' explicitly recommending ' that parents purchase an @entity12 tablet in time for the next academic year in september			1
it said it is aiming for every pupil in years seven , eight and nine to be equipped with an @entity4 , and has written to parents explaining three options for purchasing the device , which it says is ' entirely optional '			1
@entity19 and parents who are concerned at the ' strong recommendation ' that they will have to purchase @entity4 for their children before next term @entity6 , in @entity7 , @entity8 , sent a letter home ' explicitly recommending ' that parents purchase an @entity12 tablet in time for the next academic year in september the school does not have funds to pay for them and has offered long - term price plans , but is encouraging parents to make a one - off payment of £ 424 or £ 306 for an @entity32			1
@entity33 said : ' having an expensive , desirable and portable device upon a child 's person creates a threat situation for them from both inside and still worse , from outside the school			0
' bringing up a family is hard these days , nothing is getting any cheaper			0
why the school thinks that most parents have hundreds of pounds to available for these things is a bit of a mystery			2
' it worries me that the school is so divorced from the realities facing many of its pupils ' families			0
' the school has laid out three payment options			1
option one - described as ' the one the school would recommend ' - involves an outright purchase for £ 424 for a full - sized @entity4 or £ 306 for a @entity60 including a cover and insurance			2
the school said it is aiming for every pupil in years seven , eight and nine to be equipped with an @entity4 , and has written to parents explaining three options for purchasing the device option two is £ 300 and £ 197 respectively without a cover or insurance and @entity71 involves monthly installments ranging from £ 10.50 a month to £ 21 per month which can be spread between 24 and 36 months			1
angered parents have set up a @entity76 page to discuss the proposals in which one mother suggested it was not fair for state schools to expect them to part with so much cash			0
@entity19 , whose son @entity82 is in year 7 , wrote : ' state education should be free for all			0
asking parents to part with this amount of money so that their children can access the curriculum inherently contradicts the principle of state education			0
' even though the school has proposed a monthly payment plan it is unfair to ask parents to sign up to what is essentially a credit scheme			2
' demanding that all students have access to an @entity4 in order to participate in exercises centrally set by the teacher may have a long - term negative impact on the students ' attitudes to learning			2
' the message being sent out is that students require a specific technological device in order to learn			0
' @entity6 is rated ' good ' by @entity112 and has over 2,000 pupils including the sixth form			0
in a joint statement , headteacher @entity116 and chairman of the governors @entity115 said : ' there is no requirement for students in any year to acquire an @entity4 , but it is widely felt that there is a clear benefit in the student being able to use any tablet , small laptop or mobile technology as an additional route to learning			1

@entity6 , in @entity8 , ' explicitly recommended ' parents buy tablet
the school can not pay but has set out ' payment options ' for parents
it said the @entity4 would be ' beneficial additional route to learning '
