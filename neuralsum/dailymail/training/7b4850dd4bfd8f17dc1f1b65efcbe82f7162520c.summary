jailed : @entity0 leaving @entity1 handcuffed to a police officer after pleading guilty to abusing dozens of young boys a 71 - year - old former @entity5 teacher who sexually abused dozens of boys at a top boarding school was today jailed for nearly seven years			1
@entity0 , 71 , preyed on the youngsters while working at the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 in the early 1970s			1
the teacher , who taught in an old - fashioned academic robe and affected a fake public school accent , was caught out and sacked from his job			1
but he escaped justice after a cover - up led by the then headmaster			1
today it emerged many of his the former teacher 's victims are seeking damages for the abuse endured			1
as @entity0 was jailed at @entity1 , lawyers painted a picture of the private preparatory school run with a ' brutal ' military - style regime and described as like something out of a @entity30 novel			2
but @entity0 , then aged 30 to 32 , would behave in a more friendly and approachable way than the other masters			2
after befriending his victims he would molest them in classrooms , their dormitories and his private quarters , sometimes in the presence of other children , with his activities an open secret among the boys			1
but despite complaints he was allowed to leave the school for ' health reasons ' , and took up other private teaching posts , including offering his services to @entity48 , the court heard			2
two separate police investigations in 1998 and 2005 stalled , the court heard			2
past pupils of the £ 13,000 - a - year @entity9 school include @entity55 sailing gold medallist sir @entity53 and @entity56 and @entity58 ’s eldest son , @entity59			1
@entity0 - @entity0 yesterday admitted 42 offences of indecent assault against 24 boys aged between eight and 13 , while working at the school between 1973 and 1975			1
he also admitted a further offence of indecent assault against another child while working as a private tutor in the mid- 1980s			2
jailing him , judge @entity68 said : ' it is a sad reflection on the attitudes of that time that even when complaints were made by parents no proper action was taken to investigate these grave allegations			2
that amounted to a shameful and abject failure to deal with serious sexual abuse upon boys			0
' one can not help but conclude that the reputation of the school meant more to those in authority than the exposure of wholesale sexual abuse by a member of staff on their premises			0
' it is quite obvious that the impact of the defendant ’s behaviour has had a profound effect on them all			0
' paedophile : @entity0 leaving @entity97 in custody in the prison van after sentencing earlier , @entity101 , prosecuting , told the court : ' it is quite clear that this defendant was a persistent and predatory paedophile			1
' boys at the school were separated from their families as boarders so there was ' no escape ' from their tormentor , she said			0
for each victim it was their first sexual experience , they found it difficult to comprehend what was happening and it left wrecked lives , leaving years of feeling guilt and worthlessness and resentment towards their parents , miss @entity113 told the court			1
while the psychological harm had lasted 40 years for some victims , the defendant told probation officers he was abused as a youngster himself and said of his victims , ' why ca n’t they get over it ? ' @entity0 ’s abuse was uncovered after the father of one boy overheard his son talking about it and contacted the headmaster , @entity139			1
but mr @entity139 concluded ' nothing sinister ' had occurred , until weeks later the defendant was found in a ' compromising position ' while tutoring another boy privately at a nearby house			0
@entity0 was allowed to resign on health grounds and the real reason covered up , though school governors and doctors were aware of the real situation but did not want to ' stir up trouble unnecessarily '			0
the head wrote to one parent that police involvement would do ' untold damage to the school ' and the ' quicker we can forgive and forget the better '			0
cover - up : @entity0 was caught preying on youngsters at the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 in the early 1970s but escaped justice after the then headteacher hushed up the abuse the defendant ’s name was however put on ' @entity164 ' by the @entity165 and barred from working in state schools - though not , it appears from working in private schools or as a private tutor			1
he faked references and worked as a private tutor in @entity171 and for a number of schools until his past was found out			0
@entity175 , mitigating for the defendant , said : ' the climate during the 1970s was as far removed from the climate that exists today than can possibly be imagined			0
' i do not seek to suggest that what occurred all those years ago was any less reprehensible			2
' when one listens to the regime that existed in the school in the 70s it does from today ’s perspective , seem rather @entity185			0
' judge @entity186 interrupted : ' dickensian			0
@entity0 was known as just @entity0 at the school and when and how he acquired his double - barrelled name is unclear			0
he was noted for wearing an academic gown while teaching and affecting the manners and accent of an upper - class public schoolboy , claiming to be an old @entity195			0
he also had a conviction for fraud after adopting the names of peers of the realm to write out cheques			0
in fact he was born in @entity203 , the son of a post office worker , and went to a local state school			0
today it emerged a number of his victims are seeking damages for the abuse endured			1
@entity212 , a solicitor representing two of @entity0 's victims each seeking £ 35,000 said : ‘ the school allowed @entity0 to abuse his position of trust purely for his own sexual gratification			1
‘ matters are compounded by the fact the school even knew what was happening and covered up the situation to protect themselves , when really they should have been protecting the children in their care			2
changes : @entity229 , current chairman of governors at @entity9 , issued a ' heartfelt ' apology ‘ financial compensation is not going to mend the harm that has been done , but any compensation awarded may mean that they can obtain the specialist professional help that they may require			1
’ lawyer @entity238 , of @entity239 , who is also representing a number of former pupils , added : ‘ for months many of @entity0 ’s victims believed that they would have to attend court and recount the abuse they had suffered			1
‘ it is quite possible there are other people who have been abused by @entity248 who have not yet come forward			1
my advice is that they should contact the police as soon as possible			0
’ @entity229 , chairman of governors at @entity9 , apologised to the former pupils and strongly condemned @entity0 ’s actions			1
he said the school was a very different place today , adding : ‘ these offences are abhorrent and deplorable			0
' our first thoughts are with the victims who will have lived with this dreadful experience for their entire adult lives			2
‘ the school would in no way condone the ‘ covering up ’ of any allegations or behaviour that could risk a child ’s welfare			0
‘ policies on safeguarding are very different these days and much more robust and effective against this type of offence			0

@entity248 abused children at @entity9 in @entity11
he was caught out and sacked but escaped justice after a cover up
forty years later he has finally been sent to prison for abusing 24 pupils
several of the man 's victims are now seeking damages of up to £ 35,000
