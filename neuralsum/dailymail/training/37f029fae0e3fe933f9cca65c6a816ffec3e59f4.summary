hundreds of thousands of hospital patients are being injected with potentially dangerous blood - thinning drugs for no good reason , a leading expert is warning			1
they are needlessly being put at risk of strokes , major stomach bleeds and other serious complications , said vascular consultant dr @entity9			1
some are even dying due to the powerful drugs			0
he said too many were being given the thinners because guidelines were littered with ‘ schoolboy errors ’			1
blood thinners known as heparins can cut the risk of death from pulmonary embolism by two - thirds - if used in the right patients ( file picture ) his criticisms are all the more potent because he helped push for greater use of the thinners in the first place			1
a decade ago , about 25,000 people were dying every year after developing deep vein thromboses ( @entity29 ) while immobile in hospital beds			2
these clots usually form in a leg vein before travelling through the body and getting lodged in the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the lungs			0
the condition , known as a pulmonary embolism ( @entity40 ) , is often fatal			0
blood thinners known as heparins can cut the risk of death from @entity40 by two - thirds – if used in the right patients			1
but dr @entity9 believes the drugs are now being used ‘ too broadly ’			0
he said : ‘ for patients who are at risk of developing a fatal clot , that risk [ of the drugs ] is balanced by the risk that they might die if they do n’t get treated			0
but you can not justify giving this treatment to low - risk or negligible - risk patients			2
they are being put at risk of a fatal bleed in their stomach or brain that could easily kill them			0
’ about two million people are admitted to hospital every year for urgent treatment , with 800,000 rightly being given the thinners , says dr @entity9			0
but he added : ‘ about 20 per cent of the remaining 1.2 million – 240,000 people – also get treatment even though there is no evidence they will benefit			0
the criteria for giving blood thinners are far too broad			2
’ dr @entity9 says two million people are admitted to hospital every year for urgent treatment due to blood thinners he said there was ‘ no evidence ’ that they cut deaths in patients with a range of conditions including diabetes , high cholesterol and asthma			1
according to dr @entity9 , who advises the @entity86 on dvts and @entity88 , the @entity89 and @entity90 ( @entity91 ) , which drew up the guidelines , erroneously recommended such patients got heparin			1
‘ @entity91 made these schoolboy errors , because people who drew up the guidelines do n’t know the subject , ’ he said			1
studies show that one in 100 hospital patients given heparin suffer what dr @entity9 called ‘ major bleeds ’ – such as bleeding in the brain or another major organ to such an extent that they lost two units of blood			2
@entity91 said it was looking at the matter urgently			0

powerful blood thinners that stop @entity29 are being used in the *wrong* patients , says expert
side - *effects* of blood - thinning *herparins* can include strokes and major stomach bleeds
' schoolboy errors ' with @entity91 guidelines mean thousands are getting them for no good reason , warns dr @entity126
