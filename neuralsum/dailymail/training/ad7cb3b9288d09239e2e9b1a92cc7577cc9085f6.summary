by @entity0 published : 13:18 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 13:18 est , 27 october 2013 notorious : ' cheriegate ' conman @entity1 , 51 , has arrived in @entity2 on a false passport after going on the run from a three - year jail sentence in @entity6 notorious ‘ @entity11 ’ conman @entity1 , on the run from a three - year - jail sentence in @entity6 , has surfaced in @entity2 , after arriving in disguise on a false passport			1
in an audacious attempt to remain out of prison after being sentenced for his continuing involvement in the weight loss industry against a court - ordered ban , the 51 - year - old former ‘ friend ’ of @entity22 , is now seeking protection in the @entity25 nation			1
he has refused to reveal how he managed to escape from @entity6 , but has admitted travelling in disguise and using a false passport			1
‘ i ’m a stranger again , ’ he said			2
‘ i just feel incredible sadness			2
’ @entity1 , who helped @entity22 purchase two discounted flats in @entity31 in 2002 , sparking alarm that she had used a notorious conman , was last week sentenced in his absence to three years imprisonment by a judge in @entity37 for breaking an order not to be involved in the slimming industry			1
he should have arrived in court to hear the judge deliver his punishment , but instead sent a rambling letter in which he said he had got the date wrong and even hinted that he had contemplated suicide because of the hounding he had received from authorities over the years			1
a warrant was issued for his arrest but until he made contact with an @entity6 newspaper at the weekend his whereabouts were unknown			2
he said he now regards @entity2 as his version of @entity54 ’ @entity55 - a reference to the @entity57 who lived in the @entity60 country for years after escaping @entity62 justice			1
@entity1 told @entity64 ’s @entity63 that his escape to @entity2 - where he had once lived and where he had been formerly arrested for allegedly conning a bank out of a large sum of money - had left him exhausted and ‘ sick to the stomach ’			1
he added : ‘ there is a sense of exhilaration			2
but i ’ve left a beautiful home and a beautiful family now			2
‘ i ’m a stranger again			0
it ’s hard to celebrate			0
i know i should be happy , but i ’m not			0
i just feel incredible sadness			0
’ he revealed that , fearing a jail sentence was looming , he had been planning a possible escape from @entity6 for six months			0
referring to justice @entity79 , who sat in the @entity80 to deliver the three year sentence last week , @entity1 said : ‘ if the judge had given me three months which in itself is severe for a contempt charge , i probably would have served it			1
help : @entity1 helped @entity22 to purchase two discounted flats in @entity31 in 2002 , sparking alarm that she had used a notorious conman ‘ there is n’t a lawyer you could ring in @entity64 who would n’t say the sentence was savage and would n’t stand up on appeal			1
’ he has previously told the court in a letter that he would give himself up once he knew that his ageing , ailing mother , @entity100 , could be cared for if he was in prison			0
now he has told the @entity64 paper that ‘ this is not about avoiding jail			0
‘ this is bigger than me			0
it ’s about my mother			0
she will not spend the twilight days of her life in a nursing home			0
she will spend it being cared for by me and she will spend it with a cool sea breeze in her hair , in the shade of a coconut palm			0
‘ her therapy will be floating in a blue lagoon			0
i just know this place ( @entity2 ) will be my mother ’s fountain of youth			1
’ he insisted that he had been maliciously prosecuted because he was @entity1			1
the self - promoted ‘ international man of mystery ’ said the steps he had put in place to leave @entity6 were always an ‘ in case of emergency , break glass ’ situation			0
family ties : @entity1 has previously told the court in a letter that he would give himself up once he knew that his mother , @entity100 , could be cared for if he was in prison			1
the pair are pictured together with @entity2 police officers in 2006 ‘ as it was , this judge broke the glass for me when he handed down probably the highest sentence for contempt ever in this country and for one of the most insignificant contempt ever			1
’ he then made a ‘ playing with fire ’ comment in which he said what the judge could do with his sentence			0
@entity1 , who has been imprisoned in @entity62 , the @entity148 and @entity6 in relation to his banned involvement in the weight loss industry , knows @entity2 well			1
he spent many years in the country when he was younger and had rented a villa with his mother			2
but he became heavily involved in @entity2 politics and then he was arrested and charged with money laundering			1
he literally ran from police but was caught when he dived into a river and hit his head on a boat			0
later , however , he escaped on a yacht and swam ashore in neighbouring @entity162 , where he was arrested again and deported to @entity6			0
paradise : @entity1 told a newspaper that he wanted his mother @entity165 to spend the her twilight years with a ' cool sea breeze ' in @entity2 he told the @entity63 at the weekend that he was now being looked after by friends in @entity2 and that he hoped to have an audience this week with acting prime minister @entity170 to talk about receiving permanent asylum			1
but whether he is successful remains to be seen - @entity6 is expected to put enormous pressure on the @entity2 authorities to arrest the fugitive and deport him to @entity64			2
his flight from his prison sentence , which has embarrassed police and immigration authorities , is certain to bring an added jail term			0
while he has refused to reveal just how he got out of the country , there would be only two ways - by air or sea			0
had he attempted to use a false passport at an airport , it would have been picked up by a sophisticated scanning system - particularly as a watch has been issued for him			1
his most likely escape would have been by sea , using a yacht to slip away from a ‘ quiet port ’ and head direct to @entity2 .			2
