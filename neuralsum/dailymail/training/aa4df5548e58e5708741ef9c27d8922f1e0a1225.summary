@entity0 broke out in the @entity1 on tuesday night after a state senator wearing pink running shoes tried to filibuster a sweeping anti-abortion bill for 13 hours , but fell less than two hours short			1
a crowd of hundreds of her supporters in the @entity1 gallery then took up her cause and attempted to shout down the @entity10 lawmakers before they could vote on the measure that would close nearly every abortion clinic in the state			1
the republicans who control the @entity1 say they passed the bill with seconds to spare before the legislative session ended at midnight			1
@entity18 claim time ran out and that any vote passing @entity21 is void			2
it remains unclear whether the bill passed in time , but the last - minute procedural wrangling on the floor of the @entity1 is likely to be challenged in court			1
mrs @entity28 wore pink running shoes to prepare for the marathon session of speaking - for which she was not even allowed to lean against the table the drama in @entity29 began with @entity18 state senator @entity28 , who laced up a pair of pink running shoes about 11am tuesday and settled in for a grueling marathon filibuster			1
if she managed to continue speaking non-stop for 13 hours until the @entity29 legislative session ended at midnight , she could prevent the @entity10 majority for voting on - and passing - the bill			1
strict state senate rules dictated that the 50 - year - old mother of two could not sit down , take a bathroom break or even lean against her table in order to continue the filibuster			2
she also had to continue speaking about subjects that were ' germane ' to the bill			0
but , her filibuster failed about 10pm tuesday night , less than two hours shy of her goal			2
@entity1 @entity10 ruled her out of order after 11hours when she broke procedural rules three times - twice for speaking about subjects that were not related to the abortion bill			0
the other infraction came when a @entity18 colleague helped @entity67 put on a back brace about 7pm , after she had been speaking non-stop for eight hours			2
@entity18 chose @entity69 , of @entity33 , to lead the effort because of her background as a woman who had her first child as a teenager and went on to graduate from @entity76			1
in the hallway outside the @entity1 chamber , thousands of women stood in line , waiting for people in the gallery to give up their seats			0
women 's rights supporters wore orange t - shirts to show their support for @entity69 , and @entity29 lieutenant governor @entity87 reminded those in the gallery that interrupting the proceedings could results in 48 hours in jail			2
packed : dozens of supporters and opponents of the bill lined the state @entity1 chamber to watch the filibuster @entity69 tried to stay comfortable and sharp by shifting her weight from hip to hip and slowly walking around her desk while reading notes from a large binder on her desk			1
when a male protester stood in the @entity1 gallery and shouted , ' abortion is genocide , ' @entity69 continued talking uninterrupted as the man was removed by security			2
the filibuster tuesday directed national attention on the @entity29 statehouse in @entity118			0
abortion rights supporters say the strict new abortion clinic regulations would severely limit women 's access to abortions in the nation 's second - largest state			0
president @entity126 tweeted : ' something special is happening in @entity118 tonight			0
# @entity128 , ' along with a link to watch live coverage of the filibuster			0
the hash tag # @entity133 became the second-most trending topic on @entity135 and nearly than 150,000 people tuned in on the live video feed of the @entity1 debate			0
after @entity69 was forced to stop speaking , her @entity18 colleagues attempted to carry on her work by launching numerous procedural appeals @entity87 's ruling to end the filibuster			1
at one point @entity18 state senator @entity144 protested that @entity87 , who acts as the @entity146 , had not responded to one of her motions			1
thousands of supporters tried to shout down @entity10 lawmakers to prevent them from taking a vote on the bill ' did the president hear me or did the president hear me and refuse to recognize me ? ' she asked			0
' at what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over her male colleagues ? ' the comment drew cheers from supports in the @entity1 hall			0
after the @entity10 cleared away all procedural hurdles - with minutes before the midnight deadline - it became clear that they were preparing to vote on the bill			1
the thousands of opponents of the law began screaming , booing and applauding from the gallery of the @entity1 in an attempt to stop @entity87 from taking a vote before midnight			2
both houses of the @entity29 legislature are controlled by the @entity10 , who heavily favor the anti-abortion bill			1
@entity178 governor @entity178 has promised to sign the bill			0
the @entity10 holds 61percent of the @entity1 - just shy of the two - thirds majority needed to end debate and break a filibuster			0
if signed into law , the measures would close almost every abortion clinic in @entity29 , a state 773 miles wide and 790 miles long with 26 million people			0
a woman living along the @entity189 border or in @entity29 would have to drive hundreds of miles to obtain an abortion if the law passes			0
in her opening remarks , @entity69 said she was ' rising on the floor today to humbly give voice to thousands of @entity196 ' and called @entity10 efforts to pass the bill a ' raw abuse of power			1

state senator @entity28 attempted to filibuster for 13 hours to block strict anti-abortion bill
@entity69 ' filibuster was broken at 10pm
@entity18 continued *stalling* *tactics* until just before midnight deadline for passing the bill
@entity0 broke out as opponents of the bill began shouting down republicans who tried to pass the measure
it is unclear whether bill passed
