by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 09:30 est , 29 november 2012 a @entity2 baby is struggling to learn to walk and crawl because she has giant tumours on one side of her body , making her chest and her right arm swell			1
one - year - old @entity8 , of @entity9 , in the @entity10 of @entity2 , was born with an egg - sized tumour on her chest and doctors diagnosed her as having congenital haemangioma and lipoma			1
haemangiomas are actually types of birthmarks and are rarely more than a raised lump on the skin			0
one - year - old @entity2 toddler @entity22 suffers from giant tumors on one side of her body , which make her chest on the right side and her right arm swell and a lipoma is a soft , fatty lump that grows under the skin , and can occur on any area of skin where there are fat cells			1
it is harmless and can usually be left alone			0
but in little @entity8 's case , as she has grown older the tumours have spread over her right side , making it difficult for her to move and meaning she is in constant discomfort			1
father @entity39 and his wife @entity41 are now trying to raise 200,000 @entity42 ( £ 20,000 ) in surgery fees to help cure their daughter @entity8			2
her parents are now trying to raise money to treat the one year old for her unusual growth condition			0
it leaves her in almost constant discomfort the little girl 's growth is caused by congenital haemangioma and lipoma , a usually harmless but disfiguring condition @entity56 's girl : the toddler 's condition can almost be concealed in clothes , with just a slightly enlarged hand a tell - tale sign			0
but when her clothes are removed , the full extent of the growth of the tumours is clearly visible although a @entity67 country , @entity2 does not have a cradle - to - grave free - at - the - point of use healthcare system			2
instead around half of the population buy basic medical insurance which covers for half the costs of their healthcare			0
the remainder is paid either by patients or their health insurer			0
however , this leaves the poorest in @entity2 struggling to meet medical bills for serious condition like @entity8 ’s .			1

@entity8 , of @entity9 , in the @entity10 of @entity2 , was born with just an egg - sized tumour on her chest
but it has grown and spread across the right hand side of her body , making it *painful* to crawl , walk and play
