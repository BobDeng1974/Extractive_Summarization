by @entity0 if you 've ever wanted to soar over @entity2 on the world 's largest parachute , now is your chance – and you do n't even have to leave your desk			1
this dizzying footage of @entity9 's ' flying saucer ' will take you 180,000ft ( 35 miles ) into @entity2 's atmosphere as it travels four times faster than the speed of sound			1
the saucer , dubbed the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) , is designed to someday deliver large payloads , such as vehicles , to @entity18			1
the goal of this flight test - the first of three planned for the project - was to determine if the balloon - launched , rocket - powered , design could reach the altitudes and airspeeds needed to test two new breakthrough technologies destined for future @entity18 missions			1
carried as payload during the shakeout flight were two technologies scheduled to be tested next year aboard this same type of test vehicle			0
the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) is a large , doughnut - shaped air brake that deployed during the flight , helping slow the vehicle from 3.8 to two times the speed of sound			2
fire power : this image shows rockets burning on @entity9 's @entity47 ( @entity15 ) as the saucer - shaped test vehicle flies into near - space soaring high : the the balloon which carried @entity15 into high altitudes can be seen here			1
the image was taken by the saucer - shaped test vehicle 's high - resolution cameras			1
@entity9 said the test of technology they hope to one day use on @entity18 achieved most of its objectives and taught them lessons for their next attempt moment of truth : the parachute is shown here unfurling on the right			1
the balloon on the left was used to pull the 200lb ( 90kg ) parachute from its sturdy canister the @entity15 is unique in its design , using a donut - shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag			2
when attached to the exterior of a capsule travelling at @entity74 it will be capable of slowing it down to @entity76 , where a regular parachute can then deploy			0
to simulate the @entity18 atmosphere on @entity2 , the @entity15 was lifted to a height of 80,000ft ( 35 miles ) by a high - altitude balloon			1
a small rocket then launched it 11 miles ( 18km ) higher			0
as this point the @entity15 inflated around a larger saucer - shaped object , bringing it safely back to land in open water			2
the second , the @entity88 , is the largest supersonic parachute ever flown			2
it has more than double the area of the parachute which was used for the @entity93 that carried the @entity94 to the surface of @entity18			2
' a good test is one where there are no surprises but a great test is one where you are able to learn new things , and that is certainly what we have in this case			0
' said @entity106 , principal investigator for @entity15 at @entity9 's @entity107			1
' our test vehicle performed as advertised			0
the @entity39 and ballute ( a combination between a balloon and parachute ) , which extracted the parachute , also performed beyond expectations			0
' we also got significant insight into the fundamental physics of parachute inflation			0
' we are literally re-writing the books on high - speed parachute operations , and we are doing it a year ahead of schedule			0
' ' as far as i am concerned , whenever you get to ride shotgun on a rocket - powered flying saucer , it is a good day , ' said mr @entity106			1
' we hope the video will show everyone how beautiful and awesome the test was , and to just to give folks an insight into what experimental flight test is all about			0
' deflated : the test vehicle is seen here before ( left ) and after ( right ) the balloon that helped carry it to near - space was deflated			0
the plume left by the test vehicle 's main engine can be seen in these images			0
engineers arranged for the balloon to deflate and descend shortly after the rocket fired damaged : the @entity142 , one of the new technologies being developed as part of @entity9 's @entity47 ( @entity15 ) project , floats in the @entity147 after the completion of its first flight test , on june 28			1
tears are visible in the parachute , which did not unfurl as expected @entity9 officials were still pleased with the flight for the $ 150 million ( £ 90 million ) experiment , and said it was a pretty good test of technology that might one day be used to deliver heavy spacecraft - and eventually astronauts - to @entity18			1
the space agency also hopes that the new craft could one day replace the same parachute design in use since the twin @entity164 spacecraft landed on the red planet in 1976			0
the launch over @entity22 was the first successful attempt after previous flights were marred by strong winds that could have blown the craft into no - fly zones			2
technology needs to advance , or else humanity wo n't be able to fly beyond the @entity173 in low - @entity2 orbit , according to @entity175 , head of space technology , at @entity9 headquarters			0
' technology development ' is the surest path to @entity18 , ' mr @entity175 said			0
back to @entity2 : the divers , from the @entity183 's @entity182 team , retrieved the huge @entity15 vehicle just hours after the successful test in june big catch : divers retrieve the test vehicle for @entity189 off the coast of the @entity183 's @entity191 in @entity192 , @entity22			1

footage shows a june test of @entity15 conducted over @entity22 , which although successful , did n't go quite to plan
@entity14 ( @entity15 ) is designed to deliver large payloads , such as vehicles , to @entity18
it was carrying the world 's largest parachute , known as the @entity88 , which failed to unfurl properly
