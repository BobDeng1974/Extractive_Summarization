a giant leatherback turtle washed up on the same @entity2 beach where seven sperm whales beached themselves less than a month ago			1
friends @entity4 , 21 , and @entity5 made the discovery as they were walking along @entity8			1
' i 've never seen anything like it , ' mr @entity4 told @entity12			2
' i could n't believe how big it was			0
' @entity4 's friend @entity14 pictured alongside the leatherback turtle they came across on @entity8 , on @entity2 's @entity17 @entity20 senior researcher @entity19 told @entity12 the fact the turtle washed up in the same area , not far from @entity24 , the whales were found ' must be coincidental '			1
' it 's unusual to find turtles of that size this far south because of the cold but leatherbacks are able to keep themselves warm because of this blubber layer they have , they can protect themselves			0
some leatherbacks have been known to weigh more than 600 kilograms , however , this one is unlikely to have reached full maturity			1
it 's believed the turtle was up to 60 years old , weighed more than 200 kilograms and almost 2 metres in length			1
@entity20 senior researcher @entity19 said the fact the turtle washed up in the same area ( near @entity24 ) the whales were found ' must be coincidental ' ' we were just walking along and just randomly come across it , ' said mr @entity4			1
' we go down there a fair bit , never seen one of them washed up on the beach , it was quite a surprise			2
' i was not going to touch it , so we just lay down next to it and took some pics to show how big it actually was			0
' we had a good look at it and told a few people about it			0
my mate was trying to get onto the fisheries to just report it			0
' apparently it might have been there for a week at least , the fins were starting to rot away , the shell was in good condition			0
' while large turtles in the colder southern water are a rare find , there have been sightings before			0
' @entity72 do tell me they have seen them on occasions , ' dr @entity19 added			0
' they feed on the surface and are slow moving , feeding on jellyfish of all things , they pick quiet areas where there are currents , so if you are on a boat you do spot them sometimes			2
' seven beached sperm whales died on the @entity17 in @entity2 earlier this month			1
the whales were found 50 metres offshore at @entity89 , south of @entity24 locals have been shocked twice in less than a month after a leatherback turtle was found not far from where sperm whales became beached on the @entity17 in @entity2 the museum 's reptile and amphibians expert said it was likely the @entity98 had died some time ago			1
' it probably died out at sea and the currents have brought it in			0
unlike the whales who actively beached themselves , once is passive and the other active , ' he said			1
' they tend to be solo when spotted , it 's ideal spot for feeding but you do sometimes get a couple of animals come in together			2
' unfortunately there are several reasons why they die , it can be in a collision with a boat , drown when caught up in gear or they can die when eating plastic bags which they can mistake for the translucent things they normally feed on			0

a @entity98 washed up on @entity8
the turtle is believed to be at least 60 years old and just under two metres long , weighing more than 200 kilograms
7 sperm whales beached themselves at the same spot on the @entity130 just three weeks earlier
officials say the two incidents are ' coincidental '
