by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 18:52 est , 13 september 2013 split : @entity2 pictured with her former partner , @entity3 , at the @entity4 at the @entity5 , @entity6 , in 2002 wearing dark glasses and striding across the dreary @entity6 streets in her yoga trousers , she could be any other harried mother on the school run			1
but @entity2 , 55 , has n’t much in common with other @entity6 mums			1
it ’s not just the expensive highlights or £ 13,000 gold @entity16 watch which set her apart from her contemporaries , it ’s that she is what her alter ‑ ego @entity22 would call a ‘ singleton ’ in a sea of smug marrieds			1
her relationship status is n’t the only thing causing the multi-millionairess the odd sleepless night			2
her principal worry is : does anyone want to hear from @entity22 again ? for after more than a decade of complete obscurity , @entity31 has written a new @entity22 book , @entity34 , which will be published next month			1
the first book , which depicted the life of perennially single thirtysomething @entity38 — who memorably chronicled her weight and alcohol consumption each day in her diary with notes such as ‘ 130lb ( terrifying slide into obesity — why ? why ? ) , alcohol units 6 ( excellent ) ’ — sold more than 16 million copies			1
the novel spawned a 1999 sequel , @entity22 : @entity52 , and two films — not to mention a whole genre of copycat , less - than - brilliant novels about thirtysomethings waiting for mr @entity51 — and made fielding a £ 30 million fortune			1
following her success , @entity31 moved to @entity59 , where she had two children with @entity3 , a television executive on @entity62 , and virtually retired from writing			1
today , she is so fabulously wealthy that she is in the fortunate position of needing to work only if she cares to			0
so why the return to @entity38 and to @entity68 ? @entity2 said earlier this year that she had ‘ surprised ’ herself by starting to write a new @entity22 ’s diary			1
‘ after the books and the movies i sort of lost my voice ; i got all self - conscious			2
i did n’t want to just churn out another one			0
i really care about @entity38 , about her as a character and about her integrity , ’ she said			1
@entity76 starring in @entity22 : the @entity77 - @entity2 always denied the character was based on her ‘ but suddenly , about a year ago , i had a story again			1
i was finding things funny and writing things in my diary , and it started turning into a book			0
’ the plot of the upcoming novel is a closely guarded secret , but the famous daily headings about alcohol , cigarettes and weight will be a thing of the past			0
instead , @entity2 hints that @entity38 is obsessed with @entity93			1
and gone are the days when all @entity38 had to worry about was the circumference of her thighs , for she will be a mother to more than one child in her new incarnation			1
@entity31 said : ‘ she is older , so in the same way as i was looking at being a single thirtysomething in @entity52 , now i ’m looking at being older			0
and , yes , looking at motherhood			0
‘ where @entity38 was trying to be a better girl or sex goddess , to be thinner and eat less , now she ’s basically trying not to lose the children by checking her @entity93 followers while they are up a tree or something			1
‘ motherhood is certainly a rich seam of comedy			0
but she does keep the children alive throughout the book , otherwise that would rather spoil it			0
’ while loyal fans will clearly rejoice at the prospect of a new instalment of @entity38 ’s life , @entity2 is said to be ‘ nervous ’ about how it will be received when it is published next month — worried enough to ask the opinion of her teenage goddaughter , @entity121 , who happens to also be the daughter of screenwriter @entity123			1
goodbye to @entity124 : @entity2 pictured at the arrives at the @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 in 2002 @entity121 , thankfully , was positive and bolstered her godmother ’s fragile ego			1
but , sadly , the wider reaction to news of more @entity22 has been mixed , with some dismissing her heroine as irrelevant , irritating and old hat			1
indeed , the real reason for @entity31 putting pen to paper , and hopping on a plane back to @entity68 , seems nothing to celebrate			0
she has abandoned her @entity59 life — which included lunching with her best friend , the actress and author @entity140 , and @entity68 actress @entity143 — because her relationship with @entity3 has ended			1
she quietly separated from him back in 2009			0
the pair met in 2000 when she was on an @entity59 - based publicity tour for @entity22 and he just happened to be lingering in the lobby of her hotel			1
they swiftly moved in together , and @entity31 upped sticks and left @entity6			0
@entity2 has left @entity59 where her best friends included a-listers such as @entity154 actress @entity140 ( left ) and @entity68 actress @entity143 ( right ) she had experienced a series of unhappy romances in her 30s , once remarking that she ’d had more than one @entity157 — the bad boy in @entity22 — in her life			1
but with @entity3 , who had been married and divorced before , it seemed she had found a late - blooming ‘ happy ever after ’			1
she said that he was ‘ very sweet ’ and ‘ very funny ’			2
@entity160 , named after the crime writer @entity161 , was born in 2004			0
@entity3 proposed marriage when she was 48 and pregnant with their second baby , @entity163 , who was born in 2006			2
she said at the time : ‘ it was a surprise			0
[ @entity3 ] said he ’d got me a present , but i thought it was a slow cooker because i ’d been going on about it			2
’ in fact , they never married — @entity2 claimed that she was enjoying being engaged too much to spoil it			1
the couple lived a lovely life of pampered seclusion in @entity124 , where her home is just around the corner from @entity178 ’s , and took holidays in @entity180 with friends , or at five - star resorts in @entity183			2
@entity2 loved her champagne , her pool and the waving palms			2
@entity2 , pictured , can also be ' quite the diva '			2
but then , one person 's diva is another person 's successful woman she looked giddily happy at various @entity124 events and was regularly seen having dinner at the @entity192 with @entity3 , whose silver hair makes him look older than he is			2
one @entity124 friend tells me that she and @entity3 made a ‘ wonderful couple ’ , but adds : ‘ he is one of those people who does n’t suffer fools gladly at all , and she can also be quite the diva — she has a sense of how important she is			1
’ but then , one person ’s diva is another person ’s successful woman			2
indeed , @entity31 , a @entity205 girl who attended @entity206 , @entity207 , can be quite assertive			0
she took on the estate agent and the surveyor who sold them their home after the leaky roof collapsed			0
and one friend of hers , who i contacted this week , was extremely anxious about @entity31 ‘ hitting the roof ’ over publicity			2
another , who has been involved in the @entity22 movies , says that @entity31 has a reputation for being uncompromising — or ‘ difficult ’ — when it comes to anything creative			1
there were ‘ really major bloody rows ’ over both films and also the mooted stage play , which nearly reached the @entity227 this year but has been delayed until at least next year			2
there have also been arguments over the possible third @entity22 movie , which the film company @entity232 has been beavering away on for years now without coming close to shooting			2
as far as @entity3 goes , neither has disclosed what caused the end of their relationship			1
a source close to the family tells me that they remain ‘ good friends ’ and that @entity31 has kept her £ 2.2 million cream - painted home in @entity59 so that the children can go to see @entity3 in the holidays			1
‘ they are still very good friends			0
he comes over , while they see him when they go over , ’ she said			0
for her part , @entity31 has moved into a tall £ 2.5 million @entity249 townhouse in @entity6 , with a nanny for company in the daytime			0
she has been quietly moving among the local mums , most of them a decade her junior , for two years now			0
apparently she rather sticks out at the school gate , with her lovely blow - dry and penchant for leather trousers and @entity261 bags — and lack of a husband			0
there seems to be no new man on the scene for @entity31			0
her lifestyle is back to that of the resolute singleton			0
she is seen out with various good female friends , but never with a man in tow			0
in january , she took a holiday with another married couple and her children in @entity275			0
recently , she took another holiday with her old friend @entity277 , who is a key member of her @entity6 circle			0
like her , @entity277 came late to motherhood , and she left her husband behind in @entity6 to go on a mums - only holiday with @entity31			0
@entity2 signing copies of ' @entity284 ' - she has been inspired to write @entity22 as a single mum of two children who is navigating the dating scene it ’s no surprise , then , that @entity31 has been inspired to write @entity22 as a single mum of two children who is navigating the dating scene			1
she said : ‘ the book will explore this whole world of internet dating where there ’s all these cyber-presences who are n’t actually real			2
people can have entire relationships via text which are , in some ways , emotionally fulfilling and serve the purpose of a boyfriend , apart from sex			0
’ if she has had her own dabble with a cyber-romance , then it certainly has n’t produced a mr @entity51			0
but then , while she has always denied that the character of @entity38 is based on herself , maybe the role of perpetual singleton does suit @entity2 , after all .			1

she is what her alter ‑ ego @entity22 would call a ‘ singleton ’ in a sea of smug marrieds
@entity2 had ‘ surprised ’ herself by starting to write a new @entity22 ’s diary
she has abandoned her @entity59 life because her relationship with @entity3 has ended
the author has always denied that the character of @entity38 is based on herself
