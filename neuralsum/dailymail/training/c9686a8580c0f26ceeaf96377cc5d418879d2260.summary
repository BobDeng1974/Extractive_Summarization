by @entity0 for the @entity1 if @entity3 gets through this weekend ’s trip to @entity5 without seeing red , it will mark 30 matches since his last dismissal			1
now that is hardly a cause for celebration for the majority of players , but when you consider the @entity15 midfielder was previously averaging a sending - off every 26.5 @entity19 games , his satisfaction at such a run is perhaps justified			1
at 26 , @entity20 hopeful @entity3 believes he has settled down , on and off the pitch			1
one influence is @entity15 manager @entity23 , himself a hothead prone to red cards during his playing days			1
the other is a girlfriend as well as the passage of time			2
@entity3 ( left ) challenges with @entity31 's @entity30 ( right ) @entity3 ( centre ) juggles the ball during a @entity15 training session at the @entity35 @entity3 , who believes he has now settled down , pictured with @entity37 's @entity36 ( right ) ‘ you just grow up a bit do n't you ? ’ said the player once nicknamed “ @entity43 ” and who was cautioned by police after damaging five vehicles during a night out in @entity42 in 2012			1
‘ what is important is that you go through ups and downs and eventually you work out what helps you bring about a consistent level of performance			1
that 's what i 'm trying to do			0
i 'm trying to find that consistent level for 30 to 35 games			2
‘ i do n't want to be the best player one week and the worst the next			0
i 'm trying to be a good solid performer every week			0
i feel i 'm at that level now			0
‘ i think that is all down to being a bit older			0
i am 26 now , no longer a 20 - year - old			2
i 've been around a long time now as i was in the first team at @entity63 at 17			0
i just think sometimes you are just not old enough to be in the position you are in			0
it takes time to figure out things yourself			0
@entity3 has been working hard in training and is trying to become a solid performer week in , week out @entity68 ( left ) , pictured with @entity31 's @entity69 ( right ) , feels he has now been given a big role ‘ the experiences i had as a 17 - year - old will stand me in good stead and now i feel i 'm coming to a good time in my career because of what happened in the past			1
i would n't change things			0
‘ i have got a girlfriend now and i have settled down a bit , but i have always prepared right for games			1
i have always taken my football very seriously , but when i was younger i was n't as calm on the pitch as i could have been			2
‘ things also happened off the pitch which got blown out of proportion			2
i am more focussed now and feel i am at a good time in my career			0
’ the faith of @entity23 has also been a key factor			1
@entity3 was dropped after a horror show at @entity89 last season but returned to help the club escape relegation			1
and he went on : ‘ i played at @entity89 last season and had the best half of football in my career in the first and ended up giving away two goals in the second then did n't play for 10 games			2
@entity31 's @entity99 ( left ) goes down under pressure from @entity3 at the @entity101 ‘ i was really disappointed because i thought i was playing brilliantly at the time and had played in the @entity104 final the week before			1
i then found myself out the team despite thinking i had been our best player for the previous couple of weeks			0
‘ but these are problems you are going to face as a footballer and you have got to come back in the right way			0
now , i think he ( @entity23 ) has given me a role in the team			1
‘ it is a big role which you have seen in @entity23 sides in the past			1
it is that defensive midfielder position			2
‘ i 've listened to everything he has spoken about in training			0
there has been ups and downs but lately it has been going a lot more in the right direction			0
’ @entity3 ( left ) fights with @entity89 's @entity130 ( right ) @entity3 celebrates with his team - mates after @entity132 of @entity31 scored an own goal			1

@entity3 was previously averaging a red card every 26.5 games
the midfielder was once cautioned by police after damaging five cars during a night out in @entity42 in 2012
now , at 26 , he claims to have settled down both on and off the pitch
@entity3 is happy that @entity23 has given him an important role
