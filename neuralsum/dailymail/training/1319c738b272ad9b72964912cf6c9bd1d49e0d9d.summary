by @entity0 for the child who has everything , now there 's chocolate flavoured toothpaste - which costs £ 60 per tube			1
luxury oral care firm @entity6 use an extract from the cacao plant instead of flouride , something they say is a family - friendly alternative substance , not least because it tastes like pudding			2
' harnessing the power of the cocoa bean ' , the patented ingredient dubbed @entity18 is a safe - to - swallow replacement to toxic fluoride present in most toothpastes			1
@entity6 300 represents the extra-strength version of the proprietary formulation - at 10x the cost if users choose to swallow the chocolate - tasting toothpaste , they 'll also be swallowing their own plaque but if users choose to swallow the chocolate - tasting toothpaste , they 'll also be swallowing their own plaque			1
the toothpaste range is available through @entity6 's website , through which they ship worldwide , and at select @entity34			1
other credentials include that the range is fluoride free , using theobromine , calcium , and phosphate to create a natural alternative , say @entity41			1
@entity6 also claims that these compounds not only clean teeth , but actually build up your enamel , making your pearly whites even stronger			2
as for why it costs such a steep price remains to be seen			0
the classic toothpaste claims to only cost £ 6 ( $ 10 ) , but is currently unavailable for purchase on the website			1
but the @entity6 300 - the extra strength paste with extra high doses of rennou - is available for purchase , costing £ 61 ( $ 99.99 ) per tube			1
multipacks raise the price even higher and shipping costs also apply			0
one case containing 30 tubes of @entity62 toothpaste costs £ 161 @entity63 is not harmful if swallowed , making it an ideal family product - unfortunately it 's sold out it promises a rich , creamy cocoa flavour to satisfy even the most indulgent sweet tooth			1
no , it is not a naughty , gooey dessert - but rather a toothpaste that tastes like chocolate			2
they sound like the most unlikely of bedfellows , but a @entity74 company has launched the new flavour for customers with an ‘ adventurous spirit or a sweet tooth ’			2
and the toothpastes will still be good for teeth as they also contain sodium flouride			0
the firm said it was responding to feedback from customers who said they found toothpaste boring			0
depending on its success , the line could soon come to @entity100			0
@entity101 , head of scientific communications for @entity90 , said that getting the flavour exactly right was difficult			0
‘ we actually use a proprietary flavouring - and - cooling technology that delays the onset of the mint , to let the chocolate make the first impression , ’ he said			0
‘ holding back the mint long enough – 30 to 40 seconds – lets the chocolate be satisfying			0
’ but whatever flavour you choose , dental experts recommend brushing twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste .			0

@entity6 's range includes sold out £ 6 classic - and 300 £ 60 extra-strength
