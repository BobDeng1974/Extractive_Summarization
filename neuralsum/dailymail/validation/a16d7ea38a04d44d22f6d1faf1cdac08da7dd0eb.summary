' as she walks , talks and moves her hands everything about @entity2 exudes @entity18 and it is not surprising she can not even go to the grocery store without people stopping and asking her for her autograph			2
' it 's hard to go out for a coffee these days as now i have perfected my @entity18 look so much , i think half the time i think i am her , ' laughs @entity2			1
