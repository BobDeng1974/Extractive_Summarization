@entity1 boss @entity0 is braced for a ferocious derby clash at @entity3 this weekend			1
the fading @entity5 champions take on @entity6 on sunday having unexpectedly fallen behind their arch - rivals in the table			1
for most of the season city , if not looking like mounting the strongest of title defences , at least seemed destined for a top - two finish			2
@entity0 is relishing the prospect of taking on @entity6 with @entity1 on sunday @entity14 ( centre ) leaves the pitch looking despondent after @entity1 's 2 - 1 loss to @entity18 on monday @entity19 ( centre ) is blocked out by @entity21 ( left ) and @entity22 of @entity18 that is now far from certain following a dramatic slump in fortunes while @entity6 , ordinary for much of the campaign , appear to have clicked into gear in the last month			1
with just a point separating them in third and fourth , the stage is set for a battle of high intensity			1
@entity0 said : ' it is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the @entity5 every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city			1
both teams want to win			0
' it is important to be the winning team in the city - that gives an extra plus for the game , not only intensity is better but quality			2
' both teams have very good players and both managers like to play an attacking system so i hope ( for a good game for ) the fans , for whom you play , and after that i hope we can win			0
' city have held the edge over @entity6 in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend			1
a win would also see them become the first club to beat @entity6 five times in a row in the @entity5			2
@entity6 had the last laugh over @entity1 after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights			1
@entity0 said : ' i think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but i think we dominated also the @entity5			2
it is not easy for a team			0
' in the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner - up			0
this year we have been runner - up the whole year			0
' we have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay , but i think for them , they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years			0
' city are likely to come up against an altogether different opponent than the @entity18 side that frustrated them last monday			1
@entity107 's @entity6 have been fluid of late , winning impressively against @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 to take their run of victories to five			2
facing a side that is not inclined to sit back could suit @entity1 but @entity0 is dismissive of suggestions that might make it easier than in their most recent away losses at @entity18 and @entity118			1
the @entity120 said : ' you never know but i do n't think it will be easy			0
' @entity6 are a big team that like to play - especially with @entity126			1
he 's always an attacking manager			0
we hope we will see a good game			0
' we have a different problem , we have to make sure we do n't make mistakes because they have important and technically very good players			0
' despite a wretched run of just four league wins in 11 games since pulling level at the top with @entity137 on @entity138 , @entity0 maintains all possibilities remain open to his side			2
city boss @entity0 remains positive about @entity1 's achievements this season despite dropping down to fourth @entity143 is an injury doubt for @entity1 's clash against @entity6 on sunday ' i never think in a negative way , ' said the 61 - year - old , who will await the outcome of a fitness test on captain @entity143 's hamstring injury			1
' i do n't think of one , two or three points difference when you have to play seven games			0
' when you have mathematical options in football you must never give up and always believe you can do it			0

@entity1 are in fourth , a point behind rivals @entity6
city were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity18 on monday and face @entity163
