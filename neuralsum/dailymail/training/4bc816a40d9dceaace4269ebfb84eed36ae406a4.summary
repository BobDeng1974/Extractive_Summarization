an @entity1 real estate agent has calculated that the fictional value of @entity3 is $ 204,102,000			0
@entity4 , who writes novelty real estate evaluations for @entity6 , came to his conclusion by looking at the school 's estimated location , the price per square foot of comparable homes in the hypothetical area , and the approximate size of the building			1
while mr @entity4 came up with the final sum , he also enlisted the help of die - hard @entity19 fans to determine the factors that led to his calculation			1
cost of a castle : a writer for @entity1 real estate website @entity6 calculated the fictional value of @entity3 at $ 204,102,000 mr @entity4 had much of his work cut out for him by fans of the book series who had already attempted to figure out what the @entity3 would be like if it were real			1
one such enthusiast created a blog to establish the school 's approximate location in the @entity35 by looking at certain clues from the novels			1
the writer calculated that the @entity39 travels north at a speed of around 65mph , and it passes the towns of @entity42 and @entity43 - a small town on the border of @entity46 and @entity47 - on its way			0
using these factors - as well as the amount of sunlight on the day of @entity19 's trip to the school - the fan concluded that the most likely location of @entity3 is in @entity47 's @entity56			1
taking this assumption to be fact , mr @entity4 set about finding comparable homes in the @entity61 area to determine the average price per square foot			1
while no other buildings in @entity61 are quite as grand as @entity3 , by looking at five large homes in the area mr @entity4 was able to determine that the average cost per square foot was $ 493			1
the third and final step proved to be the most difficult - ascertaining the dimensions of @entity3 in square feet			0
setting : mr @entity4 based his calculations on the assumption that the most likely location of @entity3 is in the @entity56 of @entity47 probable location : this assumption takes into account the estimated speed of the @entity39 , the towns it passes on the way to @entity3 , and the amount of sunlight on the day of @entity19 's first trip to the school at first mr @entity4 looked at a model of the school , which was constructed on a 1:24 scale			1
he deduced from the model that the magical boarding school sits on 27.7 acres , and by multiplying this by the average cost per acre , he found that it would be worth $ 22,675,000			0
but mr @entity4 ultimately decided that this price was too low , and so he set about finding a better - and more creative - way of determining the castle 's actual square footage			1
' some of you might find this excessive , @entity3 is the cream of the crop when it comes to wizarding schools ' he finally decided to multiply the number of students at @entity3 by the ideal amount of space each student should have in a classroom			0
after all , he wrote , ' [ @entity3 is ] a school filled with educators who care about how students learn			0
no one can tell me that professor @entity111 does n't want her students to ace her exams			0
' again , mr @entity4 turned to @entity19 enthusiasts to figure out this number			2
fan website beyond @entity3 determined that approximately 280 students attend @entity3 , and that each classroom contains about 20 students at one time			0
mr @entity4 then turned to a study which concluded that each student should ideally have 50 square feet of space in a classroom			2
comparable houses : by looking at five large homes in the @entity61 area mr @entity4 was able to determine that the average cost per square foot is $ 493 dimensions : to accurately calculate the boarding school 's size in square feet , mr @entity4 looked at the number of students at @entity3 , how many make up one classroom , and the amount of space each student requires final sum : with seven floors , several towers and 1,000 square feet per classroom , he calculated the overall value - excluding notable features like the @entity146 field and @entity147 's shack - to be $ 204,102,000 following this guideline , he found that each @entity3 classroom would be 1,000 square feet in size			1
' some of you might find this extravagant , ' mr @entity4 admits			2
' but i 'll remind you that @entity3 is the cream of the crop when it comes to wizarding schools			0
surely , the school â€™s classrooms are spacious , right ? ' he then estimated that each floor has an area of about 51,000 square feet , meaning that the entire building - which consists of seven floors , an underground level and several towers - comes to 414,000 square feet			2
finally , with all his determining factors in place , the real estate agent concluded that the value of @entity3 school is approximately $ 204,102,000			0
the final price , notes mr @entity4 , does not include notable landmarks on the property including the @entity146 field and @entity147 's shack .			2

@entity4 at @entity6 looked at the school 's estimated location , value per square foot and approximate size to determine its value
