the @entity1 squad took almost twice the time that was originally envisaged in travelling to their first day of training in @entity5			1
when the @entity7 elected to twin the @entity10 training camp with their @entity12 hotel base in @entity13 12 kilometres away , their optimistic officials were confident the journey would take 20 minutes with the police escort laid on for all teams in the competition			1
but such is the traffic chaos that the trip , even with the outriders ensuring priority through a logjam tunnel on route , took 39 minutes			0
delay : @entity1 's commute to their training base from their hotel took twice as long as the @entity7 had expected security : the @entity7 had hoped that the military escort would speed up their journey to training the @entity7 were relaxed as they had received a transport update briefing the night before that increased the estimated time to between 30 and 40 minutes and the @entity1 bus had kept within that time frame , albeit by one minute			1
and the players enjoyed the super scenic route via @entity39 and @entity40 beaches			2
the @entity1 party will only be concerned about the journey time if the trip takes over 40 minutes on a regular basis			0
but it does n’t help that traffic starts building up on the main road outside the team hotel from 5.30 every morning			0
scenic : @entity1 train for the first time at their base overlooking @entity54 the @entity56 delegates who meet as a group ahead of the @entity58 are expected to have the organisation ’s dysfunctional governance under president @entity61 at the top of their agenda			1
and the slippery @entity61 does n’t look as though he can win on 2022 @entity64 vote corruption whatever findings investigator @entity66 delivers next month			0
if @entity66 calls for a revote , @entity61 ’s @entity58 presidency would be untenable , while any whitewash also makes a mockery of @entity58 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity7 chairman @entity72 may have made that infamous cut - throat gesture about @entity1 ’s chances in @entity75 after the @entity76 draw			1
but @entity72 , who has been criticised for trying to fit his @entity7 duties around his many other business interests , is nevertheless expected to be at the tournament for most of @entity1 ’s stay , starting with the @entity58 today before flying to @entity81 for the @entity83 game			1
@entity7 vice-president @entity84 is also travelling from the @entity58 to the @entity86 city to watch @entity1 , although he is not part of the official @entity7 delegation			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. it looks as though the @entity7 made a wise decision in moving from the @entity92 hotel on @entity40 to the more secluded @entity12			1
a huge fans ’ area , complete with giant screens and beer tents , is being constructed directly outside the @entity92 , where hundreds of thousands of fans are expected to watch the games			0
all mod cons for @entity100 @entity1 are certainly @entity76 contenders when it comes to the detailed preparation for the squad ’s stay in @entity75			2
@entity106 ’s players arrived in @entity5 on sunday to find all their leisure areas , including a games room with table tennis and pool tables , had been fitted out by @entity7 staff in the 24 hours since the rooms were handed over			2
the training ground pitch at the @entity115 military fort , prepared by @entity117 - based @entity116 , also bears no resemblance to the divot - strewn bumpy surface seen there last december , although it still cuts up quickly			0
and certainly no other federation would have spent so much time and effort preparing such lavish media facilities inside one of the fort buildings			0
the cost is understood to be around £ 80,000 , of which team sponsors @entity129 have paid £ 30,000 for their branding			0
however , despite such a welcoming environment , @entity7 spin - doctors stopped players talking about @entity83			2
home from home : @entity1 's hotel in @entity5 was all kitted out for their arrival from @entity138 @entity76 favourites @entity75 wanted @entity140 - based security firm @entity139 to guard the team during the tournament before it was insisted at high government level that @entity75 should do the job			1
@entity139 , who look after @entity146 and also sent a group to bolster security around the @entity1 team in @entity138 , provide that service for the @entity75 side on their world tours of friendly matches in the @entity76 build - up			2
and @entity139 were in line to carry on their guard duty for the hosts until the politicians intervened .			0

@entity7 make wise decision to move from hotel on lively @entity40 to more secluded @entity12
