a @entity1 police officer catches the slimiest of crooks , but it is not the kind you think			2
one of @entity9 sergeant @entity8 ' latest captures was a 1.5 - metre carpet snake that made a meal out of a young family 's pet guinea pig named @entity14			1
the officer was called to the family 's house at @entity18 on sunday to find the reptile bulging from swallowing its prey inside the pet 's hutch in the backyard			1
where a guinea pig used to be , there was a snake , ' @entity31 told @entity36			1
' the gap that it goes through when it is skinny is too small , once they have that big lump they have got to wait			0
' when the warmer months come along , @entity31 and his colleagues are not only police officers but snake catchers as well			1
he said they got calls at least three times a week to capture or rescue animals in the @entity9 region			1
the death of the guinea pig followed that one of a cat 's , which met the same fate as its fellow mammal sgt @entity8 said he was called to another home at @entity18 on monday at 6.30am , where the residence 's owner had snapped a photo of a cat 's tail sticking out of a python 's mouth ' nine out of 10 times it 's a chicken , budgerigars or cockatiels , ' @entity31 said			1

' it was a feral cat i hope , judging by its tail			2
cats are very hard to catch			0
it was probably a kitten , ' he said			0
' by the time i got there it was well and truly swallowed			0
' the people who rang it in said it [ the cat ] was n't theirs and they did n't think people around there owned it			0
' he shared a photo of a snake sitting in the colleague 's chook pen after eating a chicken 's eggs but sgt @entity8 is no stranger to animals having lived in @entity104 in far north @entity1 sgt @entity8 said it would have taken only a matter of minutes from the time the homeowner took the photo to his arrival for the cat to disappear completely , down the python 's throat			1
' when [ the owner ] only came out , there was only the bit of the arse left			0
' snakes have even been found in the backyard of one of his own colleagues			2

but it was still hungry as the snake is seen waiting patiently for the animal to get off more eggs she was sitting on so it could eat those as well			0
sgt @entity8 said it was taken away before it could do that			2
several months earlier , the sergeant had to pull another carpet snake from a drain pipe barely a kilometre away from the station on @entity141			1
several months earlier , @entity31 rescued a snake from a drain pipe in the @entity9 area the policeman has been stationed in @entity9 for nine years and snake catching comes part of the job often but the policeman is no stranger to catching dangerous animals , having been stationed in @entity104 in @entity1 's @entity150			1
though not many people would consider crocodile trapping as part of an officer 's job description , @entity31 said he had to catch a fair few during his six - year stint up in the state 's far - north			1
he helped keepers at @entity159 catch one of the park 's main main attractions , @entity161 , in 2005			0
' the croc was 14 feet [ 4.2 metres ] and we worked together with the @entity159 guys , ' @entity31 said			0
' we caught him within in an hour			0
' he was harassing kids on the boat ramp so he had to be relocated			0
' he was caught on @entity168 so they named him " digger "			0
' in 2005 , @entity31 helped @entity159 staff capture @entity161 in @entity104 in far - north @entity1 @entity172 was at that point , 4.2 metres long and was terrorising children on the boat ramp sgt @entity8 said it was a joint effort between police and zoo keepers , taking about an hour here the group is seen trying to get @entity172 into the cage in which he would travel back to @entity159 in			1

sergeant @entity8 and his colleagues often catch snakes during the summer in @entity9 in @entity1
in latest *incident* , a 1.5m carpet snake ate a young family 's pet guinea pig
this follows the capture of another snake that *gobbled* up a feral cat
but these *incident*s are not @entity31 ' first *brush* with dangerous animals
he lived in @entity104 in the @entity150 where he had to trap crocodiles on the job
