by @entity0 motorway service stations are known to charge over the odds for fast food , safe in the knowledge that they are the only option for hungry drivers			2
but it ’s not just burgers for which you pay more on a long car journey , according to a survey			2
a single banana can cost as much as 75p at a service station – more than six times the supermarket price of around 12p			1
the @entity16 service station on the @entity17 in @entity18 , where a survey found a banana cost 75p the price of a banana at @entity23 is six times as much the supermarket price of a single banana , which is around 12p the which ? survey found the cost of a banana at motorway shops ranged from 50p at the @entity33 ’s @entity32 near @entity34 , to 75p at the @entity35 on the @entity36 in @entity18			1
other items with a heavy mark - up included a bottle of water costing £ 1.59 at @entity41 on the @entity42 in @entity43			0
similar bottles in supermarkets cost between 27p and 38p			2
the most expensive cheese sandwich was also at @entity41 , costing £ 3.75 , while its supermarket equivalent was priced at just 85p			2
the survey also revealed the nation 's best and worst motorway service stations , which reveal stark differences in the quality of food and facilities at 26 of the country 's biggest rest stops			1
@entity58 , off the @entity17 in @entity57 , has been confirmed as the nation ’s favourite , winning praise for its fresh local meat and produce , its hearty food and its spotless toilets			1
a banana at @entity66 on the @entity33 in @entity34 only costs 50p , 25p cheaper than at @entity16 , according to research from which ? run by a family owned company , it was opened by @entity73 in 1972 and could not be further from the big chains which pepper the nation ’s motorways with their plastic fast food , high prices and grim loos			1
such is the quality of its produce , pies , cheeses and locally prepared food that it has been described as the @entity86 of the north , finding fame as a tourist destination in itself			0
no burgers and plastic wrapped sandwiches for @entity58 , rather traditional favourites such as hot pot and steak - and - kidney pie			1
compare that with @entity105 , just 64 miles south down the @entity17 , which is named as the worst of the roadside service stations , a brutal concrete legacy of the 1960s where the food options include @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity103			1
owned by the @entity41 group , it managed a customer score of just 39 per cent , which compares to the 90 per cent for @entity58			1
other items with a heavy mark - up included a bottle of water costing £ 1.59 at @entity115 on the @entity42 in @entity43 , pictured @entity58 is the creation of @entity117 and @entity118 who faced the nightmare news 45 years ago that the new @entity17 would rip through their peaceful @entity121 cattle farm			1
rather than simply giving in to the march of progress , they chose to work with the developers and opened their own motorway service station			1
today its farm shop stocks products from over 70 local suppliers and many others from the neighbouring counties			0
there are two butchery counters , which sell meat direct from the family farm , while there is a broad range of pies , everything from duck , plum and @entity143 to steak and kidney			0
visitors can order food up to 24 hours in advance , with many travellers choosing to stock up on farmhouse cheeses , charcuterie and a surprisingly large range of scotch eggs			0
award - winning bread is also available			0
in may this year , the family opened a second service station off the northbound carriageway of the @entity157 at @entity158 , while they recently secured funding of £ 27million to do the same on the southbound			1
the template for @entity58 has been reproduced at the new site with a farm shop that stocks products from 130 suppliers in the immediate 30 - mile radius			2
a which ? spokesman said : ‘ the family - run business is slightly different from usual service stations as it sells home - grown and local produce in its farm shop and restaurant			2
‘ it was the only location to get a full five - star rating and it achieved this feat in both food quality and toilet cleanliness			0
’ the picturesque @entity58 services on the @entity17 in @entity57 has been named the best in the country winning praise for its fresh local meat and produce the reviews of @entity105 , which is less than a one hour drive away in @entity188 , are distinctly less glowing			1
it was the first service area to open on the @entity17 in 1963 , and like other services from its time , the restaurant was located in a building on the concrete bridge which spanned the carriageway			1
today customers at @entity100 and @entity99 can amuse themselves with a bird ’s eye view of the trucks , white vans and private cars that thunder along the road beneath their feet			0
service station expert , @entity205 , of the website motorwayservices.info , said : ‘ @entity105 is on a very busy part of the motorway , but it ’s not the largest of motorway service areas ( @entity211 ) and so tends to get excessively crowded			1
‘ and , like a lot of the @entity99 and @entity100 franchises at @entity211 , it tends to be under - staffed , which means long queues at peak times and lack of cleaning			2
‘ it was the first @entity211 to open on the @entity17 in july 1963 , and it ’s built to a design which was fashionable at the time but has n’t kept pace with changes in usage patterns and customer demand since then			2
‘ lots of piecemeal additions to it over the years mean that the building is cramped and awkward to navigate inside			0
the building is ugly , and although it ’s in a mainly rural location it makes no use of that at all			0
meanwhile @entity105 services on the @entity17 in @entity188 , which was the first of its kind to open in 1963 , has been named the worst ‘ instead , it ’s screened off from the outside world by high hedges and fences all round			1
that , of course , is mainly to hide it from local residents , but it gives the entire site a claustrophobic feel			0
’ mr @entity205 said he had stayed at a motel on the site mainly to see if it is as bad as its reputation			0
‘ i have to say that i would n’t use it again unless i was desperate , ’ he said			0
he praised @entity58 saying it had ‘ managed to avoid most of the perceived issues with corporate blandness that often applies to the main operators ’			2
he added : ‘ it ’s also got some nice individual tweaks , like a farm shop on site , as well as a caravan site which is very useful for holidaymakers wanting an overnight stop on the way to @entity264			0
and it has the huge benefit of being located in a beautiful part of the countryside , which the operators have taken full advantage of in the design			0
‘ i ’m not convinced that the food itself is hugely better - or cheaper - than anywhere else , however the overall ambience of the site is certainly a lot nicer than the typical motorway service station			1
there are n’t many other places on the motorway where you can watch ducks on the lake , with the @entity121 hills in the background , while you eat your lunch			0
’ the other service stations to make the top five were @entity288 on @entity289 ( m ) with a score of 69 per cent ; @entity291 on the @entity292 at 67 per cent ; @entity296 , on the @entity289 ( m ) at 61 per cent ; and @entity293 , on the @entity294 near @entity295 at 59 per cent .			0
