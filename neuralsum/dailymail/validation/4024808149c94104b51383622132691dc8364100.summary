new ruling : all @entity2 countries will have to cut the use of throwaway ‘ plastic poison ’ carrier bags by 80 per cent following a vote yesterday all @entity2 countries will have to cut the use of throwaway ‘ plastic poison ’ carrier bags by 80 per cent following a vote yesterday			1
the decision represents a victory for @entity12 readers and the ‘ @entity13 ’ campaign , which launched in february 2008 with the backing of groups from the @entity17 to the @entity18			1
member states have set the 28 countries of the @entity2 a deadline of 2025 to meet the target which can be achieved through the introduction of bans or charges			1
the @entity26 is already on course to meet this target following decisions by the devolved governments in @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , which have already have a system of charges			1
@entity35 is set to follow suit with a 5p levy on the plastic bags in october after supermarkets failed to meet pledges to reduce bag numbers through voluntary schemes			1
all profits from the charges in @entity35 will go to good causes , which will include a raft of green clean - up groups , tackling green spaces , rivers and beaches , as well as other charities			0
similar charging schemes in @entity32 have led to a reduction of around 90per cent in the distribution of the flimsy bags , which have become a blight on streets and parks			2
volunteers at the @entity60 have been working tirelessly to clean beaches and protect sea life such as turtles , which are known to eat the bags because they mistake them for jellyfish			0
their work has been supported by money raised through a 5p charge on bags by @entity72 , which led the way among retailers in tackling the blight they cause			2
pollution and litter expert at the @entity60 , dr @entity77 , welcomed the @entity2 vote , as a ‘ useful first step ’ in the reduction in single use plastic bags			1
however , she said an original plan for mandatory charges throughout the @entity2 had been watered down with a decision to leave it up to each member state on how to achieve the promised 80per cent reduction			2
bizarrely , the @entity26 government was among those that opposed the idea of a mandatory charge across all @entity2 states			1
the @entity60 is also concerned that the bag charge scheme for @entity35 will not be as effective as those in @entity31 , @entity30 and @entity32			1
this is because it carries various exemptions , including a decision not to apply the 5p fee in small shops			0
an estimated 100 billion carrier bags are used every year in @entity100 - with 8 billion ending up as litter			0
many of those end up in seas and rivers , killing millions of marine animals			0
@entity31 was the first home nation to introduce a 5p charge four years ago			2
since then it is estimated that the number of bags issued at the tills is down by more than 75per cent			0
the decision represents a victory for @entity12 readers and the ‘ @entity118 ’ campaign , which launched in february 2008 ith the backing of groups from the @entity17 to the @entity18 there , families have found no significant problems in switching to re-usable bags and baskets for their shopping			1
some other @entity2 nations already have controls in place			0
@entity128 has a ban and @entity130 will introduce one in 2018 , while there are levies in the @entity133 and @entity134			0
a number of countries have taxes on shops which give out free bags , including @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148			0
the @entity142 @entity150 mep @entity149 , who pushed the legislation through the @entity100 parliament , called the approval ‘ a historic breakthrough in tackling the pervasive problem of plastic waste ’ .			0

@entity2 decision is a victory for @entity12 readers and @entity160 the @entity162 campaign
charge system already introduced in @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32
means @entity26 is on course to meet 2025 target , with @entity35 set to bring in 5p levy on plastic bags in october
