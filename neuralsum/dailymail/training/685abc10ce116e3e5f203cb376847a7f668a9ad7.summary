researchers have developed the first genetic strain of mice that can be infected with @entity3 and display symptoms similar to those that humans experience			1
the breakthrough could significantly speed up the development of vaccines for the killer virus , researchers say			0
until now , researchers have struggled to test vaccines effectively			0
researchers were able to breed together eight genetic mouse variants and successfully test a strain of mice to permit active research on potential @entity3 vaccines and treatments			1
typical laboratory mice usually do not develop human - like @entity3 disease , including the severe symptoms that can prove fatal in humans			1
researchers were able to breed together eight genetic mouse variants and successfully test a strain of mice to permit active research on potential @entity3 vaccines and treatments			1
this model system more accurately reflected the human experience when infected with the virus			2
the @entity26 at @entity26 , work , published in the current issue of @entity29 , will significantly improve basic research on @entity3 treatments and vaccines , which are desperately needed to curb the worldwide public health and economic toll of the disease			2
' you ca n't look for a cure for @entity3 unless you have an animal model that mimics the ebola virus disease spectra , ' said study co-author @entity40 , professor of epidemiology at the @entity42 and @entity43			2
' for the first time , we were able to produce a novel platform for rapidly developing new mouse models that replicate human disease for this virus , as well as other important emerging human pathogens			0
' typical laboratory mice usually do not develop human - like @entity3 disease , including the severe symptoms that can prove fatal in humans			1
so the researchers asked whether all mice are immune to @entity3 , or whether some strains of mice are susceptible ; and if some are susceptible , could they harness the power of mouse genetics to figure out what genes make someone susceptible to the disease			1
typical laboratory mice usually do not develop human - like @entity3 disease , including the severe symptoms that can prove fatal in humans			1
to find out , the team , including researchers from the @entity66 and the @entity68 @entity67 , where the research took place , were able to breed together eight genetic mouse variants and successfully test a strain of mice to permit active research on potential @entity3 vaccines and treatments			1
this model system more accurately reflected the human experience when infected with the virus			2
the team was able to show that a combination of genes were involved in producing a range of disease symptoms , such that the genetic variation of the mice directly led to the variety of symptoms that the disease produced			0
what 's more , the researchers pinpointed a single gene that accounted for much of that variation â€“ a gene responsible for encoding a protein known as @entity93			0
@entity94 , @entity95 , an assistant professor of medicine who has treated @entity3 patients in @entity98 , said , ' a basic understanding of how our genetics influence susceptibility to viral infections and affect disease development is absolutely critical to creating much needed therapeutic interventions			0
' @entity105 , who was not part of this research project , added , ' we can decrease @entity3 fatality rates with intensive critical care but this is difficult to do in places with limited human and material resources			0
' rationally designed treatments and vaccines are desperately needed			0
