by @entity0 published : 19:00 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 07:30 est , 7 march 2013 meals containing too much processed meat such as cheap ham , bacon and sausages could send you to an early grave , a large - scale study has found			1
analysis of the diets and medical history of almost half a million men and women linked processed meat to deaths from cancer and heart disease			1
the @entity19 - wide research , including work by @entity22 scientists , found that processed meat is to blame for about one in 30 deaths			1
the researchers suggested a limit of no more than 20g a day of processed meat – equal to one rasher of cheap bacon			1
processed meat , made by combining the leftover parts of animals which can not be sold as good cuts such as steaks and joints , contains high concentrations of fat , including artery - clogging cholesterol			2
the researchers from ten @entity19 countries quizzed almost 450,000 people , many of them @entity51 , and tracked their health for an average of 13 years			0
they said : ‘ men and women with a high consumption of processed meat are at increased risk of early death , particularly due to cardiovascular diseases but also cancer			1
’ some 26,344 of the participants died over the course of the study , with those who ate the biggest amounts of processed meat being 44 per cent more likely to have died than those who ate the lowest amounts			2
the figures for heart disease were striking – those who ate the most processed meat , more than 160g or three sausages a day , were 72 per cent more likely to die of heart disease			1
processed meat such as bacon and sausages could send you to an early grave , a large - scale study has found a study last year found that eating 50g of processed meat a day – the equivalent of one sausage or three rashers of bacon – raises the likelihood of cancer by a fifth			1
but in the latest , much bigger study , those who ate the most processed meat were almost 50 per cent more likely to suffer an early death , with heart disease the overwhelming cause			1
the study , published in the journal @entity94 , concluded that a limit of 20g a day of processed meat – equal to a rasher of bacon or one full @entity99 breakfast a week – would prevent about 20,000 early deaths in the @entity51 each year			1
@entity101 , a dietician at the @entity102 , said : ‘ with spring in the air , many of us may be looking forward to sunny barbecues			0
but this research suggests processed meat , such as sausages and burgers , may be linked to an increased risk of early death			1
diets laden with pies , sausages , and ready meals can lead to an early death , a major study has shown ‘ however , the people who ate the most processed meat in this study also made other unhealthy lifestyle choices			1
‘ they were found to eat less fruit and vegetables and were more likely to smoke , which may have had an impact on results			0
’ professor @entity127 , one of @entity51 ’s leading cancer specialists and an unpaid member of the industry - backed @entity130 , said the key to good health is a balanced diet			2
he said : ‘ do n’t worry about having a bacon sandwich			0
it is not going to kill you			0
but do n’t have four bacon sandwiches every day for your whole life			2
’ the amount of white meat eaten , such as chicken , was not linked to death rates by the researchers , while small amounts of red meat appeared beneficial			2
speaking on @entity152 's today programme , @entity147 , professor of food policy at @entity149 , @entity150 , said : ' this study is yet another little plank going into the edifice saying we 've got to down on [ processed ] meat			2
' this is what we 're saying , let 's lower the amount of animals we are producing			0
we need to reduce the cattle culture in this country			0
' the key issue is we do n't know what a good diet is , we 've had dietary guidelines based on a very narrow based idea of what is nutrition			0
' for me , this study is another reminder of the need to go for a more sustainable diet			0
' a @entity178 spokesman said : ' it 's important that everyone eats a balanced diet			0
eating well and being active can help prevent serious illnesses such as cancer and heart disease later in life			1
' red meat can be part of a balanced diet			0
but people who eat a lot of red and processed meat should consider cutting down as regularly eating a lot could increase your risk of bowel cancer			2

' burgers , sausages and pies were particularly singled out as being harmful			0

analysis of diets of *500,000* linked meat to cancer and heart disease deaths
should be ' limit of no more than 20g a day of processed meat ' , equal to one rasher of cheap bacon or one full @entity99 breakfast a week
