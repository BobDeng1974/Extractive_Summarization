in the area nowadays you can find a £ 15 - a - night caravan site with coin - operated hot showers			2
but while the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , might not sound luxurious today - it 's certainly a major improvement on what it would have been like there 1million years ago			1
scientists now believe early humans created their first settlement at the coastal site - which lies north - east of @entity15 - after finding a series of stone tools and fossilised animal remains there			1
on the coast : scientists now believe early humans created their first settlement at the @entity4 ( seen from above ) in @entity5 , @entity6 - after finding tools and fossils there an artist 's impression of @entity5 , @entity6 , when scientists believe it was occupied by an ancient race of humans - who could have been the homo antecessor or homo erectus species the artefacts have been dated to nearly 1million years ago , which makes them the oldest found in @entity33 - and suggests the species who lived there were primitive predecessors of modern humans			1
they could have been the homo antecessor or homo erectus species , who both had comparatively small brains and might have even been cannibals as well as hunters , reported @entity45			1
the dramatic discoveries are set to be revealed next month in the ‘ @entity33 : one million years of the @entity48 ’ exhibition at the @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51			1
scientists believe the site the early humans lived on was on the @entity54 , which flowed out into the @entity55 at that time - and are finding the north @entity6 coast to be a goldmine of artefacts			1
map : the caravan park in @entity5 is located on the north @entity6 coast , north - east of @entity15 experts are making many new discoveries with the coastline being one of the @entity33 ’s fastest - eroding - but they are yet to find any human remains from our predecessors , reported @entity45			1
professor @entity68 from the museum said : ‘ from the earliest human fossils in @entity33 to one of the oldest wooden tools in the world , you will be surprised by the history hidden beneath your feet			0
‘ the story behind the humans who inhabited ancient @entity33 has taken us more than a decade to piece together			0
this gives us an exciting glimpse into our past ( and ) leads us to reflect on our future			0
’ temperatures when the first humans arrived in @entity33 would have been several degrees colder than nowadays - and they would have also faced dangerous wildlife including sabre - toothed cats			2
however , they would have been attracted by the chance of hunting mammoths and bison - as well as being able to walk to mainland @entity94 , with @entity95 connected to @entity96 by land at that time			0
we still know relatively few facts about the homo antecessor , but it is believed they were the first @entity102 because they were the only known to live in @entity94 at the time			0
fossil remains found in @entity105 suggest they had stronger brows and bigger teeth than modern humans - but also smaller brains and potentially even cannibalistic behaviour			2
they would have lived on the flood plains and marshes that bordered the ancient route of the @entity54 in @entity6 , alongside sabre - toothed cats , hyenas , horses , mammoths and deer			0
they measured around 5ft 6in to 6ft , weighed between 9st and 14st and are believed to have been right - handed			0
however , no complete skeletons have ever been found .			0
