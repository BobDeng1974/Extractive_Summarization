by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is a man on death row according to @entity4 , who plans to be his public executioner at @entity6 in their @entity7			1
that provocative description of @entity2 on the eve of their @entity6 showdown was just about the only nasty moment of their final media confrontation before they duel for the world super-middleweight championship			1
@entity4 is unconcerned that such a remark , in the context of the dangerous old game of prize fighting , might be frowned upon			2
winning shot ? @entity4 has vowed to stop @entity2 with a left hook at @entity6 days away : @entity4 and @entity2 went head to head on the @entity6 pitch after the press conference champion : @entity2 defends his @entity30 and @entity31 super middleweight titles at the national stadium in @entity33 @entity34 : the challenger had a huge entourage at @entity6 for the final press conference the fight game is a brutal sport , with two warriors attempting to land the knockout blow			1
at its best , it can provide epic sporting drama , demanding fitness , skill and bravery			0
fighting talk to sell tickets is as old as the @entity49 but why must modern fighters , obsessed with boosting pay - per - view numbers for their television paymasters , resort to such puerile rhetoric ? talk by @entity4 that his champion opponent @entity2 is on ‘ death row ’ is unedifying and insulting			1
@entity57 may feel he can win			1
but this trash talk should have no place in a sporting arena			2
he is using the language of a loser			0
he used the analogy to reinforce his belief that the @entity67 is about to be hit by the enormity of the biggest fight to take place in post-war @entity71			2
@entity4 says , ‘ hit he will be , by the scale of the event as he comes out and by the left hook with which i predict i will knock him out			1
‘ he is like a man on death row because he knows what ’s coming … his hour of destiny			0
’ i say everything for a reason			0
i do n’t worry what people think , that they sometimes mistake my self - confidence for being too cocky			0
as for me , i ’m never nervous before or during a fight			0
i ’m always calm and composed – and even more so now because both @entity2 and i know that this is a fight he ca n’t win			1
’ @entity2 responded in a less outrageous manner , saying : ‘ yeah , i ’m apprehensive but not because of @entity4			1
this is a huge event in which i want to perform in a way that will show the world what i can do			0
‘ that ’s the pressure on me but i always perform at my best under pressure			0
’ game on : @entity2 and @entity4 were remarkably calm at the final press conference at @entity6 favourite : @entity2 is confident he can defend his two world titles at @entity6 on saturday almost there : @entity2 and @entity4 faced the media for the final time as they get ready to take to the ring @entity4 insists that , for the most part , he called a halt to the mind games with which he angered and unsettled @entity2 before their first fight ‘ because i do n’t want to upset him any more ’			1
he added : ‘ i want to keep him in a quiet place to think about what ’s coming			0
’ @entity2 retorted : ‘ i saw @entity4 somewhat subdued and perhaps it ’s getting to him now			1
he did n’t say a word to me so was unusually quiet			0
‘ it can be like that before you go against a great fighter			0
it was like that for me when i boxed @entity122 in @entity123			0
i was super confident in the weeks leading up to the fight and then came the main press conference – like this one – and it suddenly dawned on me what a terrific champion i was about to face			0
i was right about that , having to get off the floor to win by knocking him out in the last minute			0
’ @entity4 did stir the pot a little more by reiterating his opinion of @entity2 as a technically deficient boxer and putting some of the blame for that on his renowned trainer @entity137			1
he said : ‘ @entity137 is a good trainer but @entity2 ignores his instructions once the fight warms up and like most boxers reverts to type in a crisis			2
i think it ’s possible that @entity137 is so aware of @entity2 ’s reputation as a warrior who can take shots and still win that he has neglected working on his technical skills			2
’ tight team : @entity4 claimed @entity137 ( left ) is partly to blame for @entity2 's deficiencies man in the hat : @entity2 responded by criticising @entity4 ' trainer @entity152 's professional record in your corner : promoter @entity155 ( centre ) is backing his man @entity2 to beat @entity4 for a second time @entity137 had a distinguished ring career of his own and is also head coach of the @entity162 boxing team , which he steered to a medal haul at the @entity164			1
@entity2 was quick to contrast @entity137 ’s record of 33 wins against only one defeat in the course of winning @entity71 and @entity170 titles with the background of @entity4 ’ trainer @entity152			1
@entity2 said : ‘ i do n’t pay much attention to @entity173			2
he had just five professional fights			0
and while i respect any man brave enough to get in the ring , his record is five fights , five defeats , three of them by the big ko			0
‘ i trust @entity137 absolutely and he is bringing me to this fight , at 36 years of age , back to the best physical and mental condition i ’ve ever been in my career			0
’ in rebuttal , of the @entity57 predictions of easy victory , @entity2 said : ‘ first it was going to be three rounds , then it might be five , now it ’s going to be the left hook instead of the big right he knocked me down with in the first round of our last fight			1
‘ i do n’t listen to his nonsense either			0
’ enter the champion : @entity2 makes his way into the final press conference at @entity6 on thursday fighting talk : @entity4 and @entity2 are both confident of knocking each other out at the national stadium each man is envisaging a one - sided fight in his favour , which may not be to the expectations of the biggest fight crowd in this country since the war if one of them proves himself right			1
while @entity2 has rejected a request from promoter @entity155 to consider an appearance at the @entity213 vs @entity214 friendly on this @entity6 turf 24 hours before the fight , @entity4 will attend the match			1
@entity155 had been keen to help boost the @entity219 pay - per - view sales by having both combatants appear on the pitch at half time			2
permission for @entity57 to do that may not be granted if @entity225 , who are broadcasting the football , deny their rivals such a promotional opportunity during their transmission			2
@entity231 is live on @entity232 on saturday night			1

@entity4 says there is no way @entity2 can win their fight
@entity240 rematch takes place at @entity6 on saturday night
@entity4 claims he will knock @entity2 out with a left hook
@entity2 believes the enormity of the *occasion* is dawning on @entity57
@entity57 could walk out at @entity6 at half - time of @entity213 vs @entity249
but @entity2 does not want the *distraction* on friday night
