the @entity15 midfielder was given a straight red card after losing his cool in the 40th minute , by which time @entity11 were already a goal behind			2
@entity11 ’s night went from bad to worse following @entity8 ’s dismissal , as they conceded three times in the second half to quash any dreams they had of qualifying for the knockout stages			2
and to top things off , @entity26 defender @entity25 headbutted team - mate @entity28 in the closing stages			1

goals : @entity67 11 , @entity4 48 , @entity9 61 , 73 attendance : 36,000 referee : @entity82 ( @entity83 ) @entity84 : @entity4 @entity67 ’s close - range finish gave @entity6 the lead against the run of play in the 10th minute , after the @entity11 had sparkled in the opening exchanges			1
a thunderous run and strike from @entity4 doubled @entity6 ’s advantage shortly after the break , before @entity9 marked his return from suspension with two goals in quick succession			1
there had been encouraging signs for @entity11 from kick - off , as they launched a series of attacks down the right			0
it took them 91 seconds to register a shot against @entity107 in their 1 - 0 defeat in the opening game , but at the @entity112 that statistic was put to bed			2
less than 30 seconds had passed when @entity28 fashioned their first chance , firing into the side - netting from an acute angle			0
@entity119 ’s side continued to push and probe , with @entity42 , starting in place of the injured @entity50 , causing particular havoc with his pace and trickery			0
then , against the run of play , @entity6 took the lead			0
a dangerous cross from @entity58 from the right fell straight to @entity4 on the edge of the box and he dissected the @entity11 defence with a perfect pass to the back post , where @entity67 was on hand to thump home			1
@entity136 thump @entity11 in @entity13 reducer : @entity61 takes out @entity28 early on in the game getting shirty : @entity140 fans show their support for their countrymen inside the @entity143 fanatic : one @entity11 fan gets in the mood for the game by painting himself in his country 's colours opener : veteran forward @entity67 beats his marker to give @entity6 a deserved first - half lead packed to the rafters : fans in @entity156 's main square celebrate cheer on @entity6 it was @entity67 ’s second @entity160 goal , more than a decade after his first , which came in a 2 - 1 victory over @entity163 in the 2002 group stages			1
@entity6 ’s opening goal against @entity166 was created on the wing and it was out wide that @entity169 ’s side looked to test @entity11			2
@entity58 and @entity4 continued to combine well down @entity6 ’s right , with @entity26 left - back @entity25 struggling to deal with the dual threat they posed			1
@entity50 could only gesture wildly from the bench as his team - mates lost their footing in the game as the half wore on – and their problems were compounded in the 40th minute when @entity8 was dismissed			1
referee @entity82 reached straight for red after @entity8 wildly lashed out at @entity9 with his arm as @entity6 tried to counter down the left - hand side			1
@entity8 bowed his head as he trudged from the pitch in @entity13 , four years after his spat with @entity50 had split the @entity11 camp			2
@entity11 lost all three of their games at that tournament , and look to be heading for a similar conclusion in @entity166			2
moment of madness : former @entity192 man @entity8 was sent off for a wild elbow on @entity9 doubling up : @entity4 completely dumbfounds @entity194 to score @entity6 's second come in @entity196 : @entity197 winger @entity4 looks delighted after scoring his goal back of the net : the view from behind the goal as @entity4 's strike beats @entity203 bullet header : @entity194 is beaten again , this time by a @entity9 header to make it 3 - 0 what was so frustrating for @entity11 and their fans was that @entity8 had been playing very well			1
before his moment of madness the former @entity192 man and @entity210 had been doing a fine job of keeping @entity6 ’s central midfield pairing of @entity63 and @entity215 quiet			0
how that would change with @entity11 down to 10 men			0
even in the final minutes of the first half , the space song ’s absence afforded them was noticeable			0
@entity119 introduced defender @entity221 for the second half to try to shore up @entity11 ’s defence			0
@entity224 : @entity226 striker @entity9 celebrates his first goal tap - in : @entity9 was left with the simplest of finishes to make it 4 - 0 to @entity6 game over : stars of the show @entity4 and @entity9 go wild again as @entity11 are put to the sword his first involvement was to trail in @entity4 ’s wake as the @entity197 forward hared down the left , cut into the penalty area , and then curled a shot into the far corner with @entity242 pulled out of position			1
@entity9 needed two chances to make it 3 - 0			0
first he shot wide after being put clean through by the @entity166 - born @entity64 , before rising highest to head an outswinging @entity247 corner past the despairing dive of @entity250			0
@entity6 freshened things up with 20 minutes left , introducing @entity252 starlet @entity65 and former @entity192 forward @entity68			0
scrap : @entity25 and @entity28 come to blows as @entity6 are gifted another chance late on peacemaker : unused substitute @entity50 steps in calm things down and it was the two substitutes that combined for @entity6 ’s fourth and final goal			1
@entity65 cut the ball back to @entity68 , the @entity263 striker forced @entity250 into a smart low stop , but there was @entity9 on hand to pass the rebound into an empty net			0
then came the unsavoury clash between @entity25 and @entity28 , which rather summed up @entity11 's night			1
three points for @entity169 ’s side keeps their hopes of advancing to the last 16 alive , with @entity107 their opponents in their final group game on june 23			0
marching on : @entity6 know a win over @entity107 will send them through into the knockout stages			2

@entity11 out of the @entity160 after second successive defeat
two from @entity6 , @entity166 and @entity107 will *progress* to last 16
@entity67 gave @entity6 the lead after 11 minutes
@entity8 sent off for elbowing @entity9 on 40 minutes
@entity4 doubled @entity6 's lead just after half - time
@entity9 then scored twice in the second half
@entity25 headbutted team - mate @entity28 late on
