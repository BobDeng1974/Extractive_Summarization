this is the touching moment orphaned leopard @entity2 bounds towards her human companion , attempting to curl up on her lap and clamber all over her			1
despite her huge size , the black leopard can be seen enjoying a playful tumble with volunteer @entity9 , who has worked with the abandoned animal since she was a cub			1
completely unaware of her enormous frame , the leopard spots her friend and leaps up onto a platform , trying to sit on her lap and scrambling all over her , much as a kitten would			1
the big cat , whose coat appears to be solid black because her spots are hard to distinguish , was abandoned by her mother when it was just a few hours old			1
she was taken to @entity24 , a charity which carries out conservation work in @entity26 , where she was raised by volunteer @entity9 who is pictured in the video			1
@entity29 , founder of the charity , said : ‘ she is just jumping and playing like they would in a tree			1
‘ the human interaction enriches their lives in captivity			2
we take them out on walks so they are not in the cages all the time			2
@entity2 loves her walks on the plains			2
‘ when she is a bit older , we will introduce her to our breeding programme which is aimed at preventing the animals from becoming extinct			2
’ @entity45 : the black leopard appears to pounce on @entity9 , the woman who raised it , in the enclosure in a wildlife centre in @entity26			1
but the animal was just playing ms @entity29 said : ‘ when we found her she weighed just 300g , which is quite light for a leopard cub			1
normally they weigh 500g when they are born			0
‘ we suspect her mother abandoned her because she did not have enough milk for her			1
‘ she was completely helpless so we took her in			0
she would not have survived otherwise			0
’ volunteers come from all over the world to work at the centre and interact with the animals			0
she added that the leopards like @entity2 , are reared from birth by humans so they do not pose a threat			0
cuddle : @entity9 cuddles the leopard she raised at the @entity24 in @entity26 she said : ‘ it ’s very safe to interact with the leopards			1
we do n’t take any chances with the volunteers			0
’ sadly , the animals will not be released back into the wild			0
ms @entity29 said : ‘ unfortunately , the ones that are born in captivity have to stay in captivity			0
we do not want to mix the genes of a leopard in captivity with one in the wild			2
’ the centre is also home to cheetahs , wolves , lions , caracals , servals and meerkats			0
ms @entity29 set up the charity after spending 22 years working for the @entity91 and realising that it was not her calling in life			2
she resigned and used a loan to buy her first animal – a cheetah			0
from there , she took on more animals and built up the centre which she hopes will save the animals from extinction .			0

cub was abandoned because its mother did not have enough milk
she was then taken in by wildlife charity the @entity24
*incredible* video shows the leopard playing with the woman who raised her
