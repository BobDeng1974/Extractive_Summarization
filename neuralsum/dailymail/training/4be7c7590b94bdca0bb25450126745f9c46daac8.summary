by @entity1 reporter published : 03:36 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 02:49 est , 6 july 2012 @entity4 is preparing to launch a smaller version of the multi-million selling @entity7 , it was claimed yesterday			1
the little brother of the tablet device would measure fewer than eight inches across the diagonal – considerably smaller than the current 9.7 - inch model – and be cheaper			2
it was also suggested what has been dubbed the ' @entity14 ' could be available in the autumn – in time for @entity16			0
the competition : @entity4 's latest ipad on offers a fantastic experience in the hand - put a painful one in the pocket ' mid-sized ' tablets such as @entity24 's @entity23 have been big sellers - and have begun to eat into @entity4 's dominance of the tablet market @entity4 is notoriously secretive about its technical innovations and rumours of the smaller tablet are said to have originated from the @entity31 , where many of the company 's devices are manufactured			1
they were reported by @entity35 and the @entity36 , which quoted several unnamed sources within @entity4 's supply chain			1
a @entity40 spokesman last night said : ' @entity4 does not comment on rumour or speculation			0
' the current @entity7 costs upwards of £ 399 and industry insiders said an ' @entity14 ' would be an obvious response to competition from rival tablets such as @entity47 's seven - inch £ 159 @entity48			1
far eastern technology blogs also hinted that a launch by @entity4 was imminent			2
@entity52 analyst @entity51 predicts that the move would be a devastating blow for @entity56 competitors			0
' it would be the competitors ' worst nightmare , ' he said			0
the late @entity4 co-founder @entity60 , who died last october , was vehemently against a smaller @entity7 , saying in 2010 : ' the reason we wo n't make a seven - inch tablet is n't because we do n't want to hit a lower price point , it 's because we think the screen is too small to express the software			1
' the @entity14 would show that @entity4 is prepared to break away from former chief exec @entity60 ' deeply - held mantras			2
future : @entity68 , director of product management of @entity47 , shows off @entity47 's new @entity48 tablet @entity48 @entity71 : $ 199 ( @entity72 ) $ 399 ( @entity73 ) $ 249 ( @entity73 ) size : 7 inches 9.7 inches weight : 340g @entity76 : 9 hours 10 hours the @entity48 packs a high - definition screen , the latest ' quad - core ' processor , runs the latest version of @entity56 , and has a battery life which can handle nine hours of continuous video playback			1
the firm hopes the tablet will take on @entity4 ’s @entity7			2
it 's part of a new generation of @entity7 rivals , including @entity88 ’s surface tablet which was revealed last week , and current @entity56 tablets including @entity91 ’s @entity90			2
two versions will be available , one with @entity72 of storage for $ 199 and a second with @entity73 for $ 249			0
by comparison , @entity4 's new @entity7 , which has a larger 9.7 inch screen , costs $ 399 for a @entity73 version			1
the @entity98 version of a tablet : the new surface was unveiled by @entity88 last week @entity91 's @entity90 is likely to be hit hard by @entity4 's new launch - the cheap tablet is also seven inches , but built on unglamorous hardware earlier this year , a @entity24 official appeared to confirm the existence of a smaller ' @entity14 ' , due to be released this year			1
the official said to a @entity107 newspaper , ' the amount of the current contract [ between @entity4 and @entity24 ] is around $ 9.7billion			0
' the contract is expected to rise to $ 11billion by the end of this year as @entity4 is planning to release a smaller @entity7 , probably with a 7.85 - inch screen , and to sell more of its @entity112 using @entity24 ’s faster solid state drive ( @entity114 ) storage			1
' @entity88 also recently unveiled its own ' surface ' tablet , a touchscreen running its new @entity120 software			0
@entity4 's new tablet will also be a concern to @entity91 , as their @entity56 - running tablets , such as the @entity90 , have been runaway successes in the @entity125 @entity90 is also a seven - inch tablet , built around the old @entity126 , but running a customised version of @entity56 focused on selling videos , apps and music via @entity91 's marketplace			1
@entity88 has previously tried and failed at bringing @entity98 tablets to the market			0
@entity134 spent the tail - end of the 1990s trying to convince people that tablets were the wave of the future - but @entity88 never quite got either the hardware or software working together , and their early efforts - as long ago as 2001 - never convinced anyone			0
the runaway success of ' mid-sized ' devices such as @entity24 's @entity23 , which has a five - inch screen , has helped @entity24 gain ground in the tablet market on the other hand , the risk to @entity4 is that a different - sized tablet might lead to fragmentation - where apps and games need re-configuring by their developers to ensure they are compatible on both versions			2
this has been @entity56 's biggest issue in the last few years			0
different screen sizes , different manufacturers , different versions of the operating system and different price - points all lead to choice for the consumer - but at the cost of development headaches and an inconsistent experience .			0
