by @entity0 published : 04:41 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 12:33 est , 6 march 2014 when @entity4 bank manager @entity3 , 30 , began losing his hair in his early twenties , he was both devastated and embarrassed			1
but his problems got worse when , after spending months saving up , he splashed out on a seven - hour hair transplant operation that left him with even fewer working follicles than before			1
now he says the backfiring treatment has left him humiliated and self - conscious and says he has had to resort to using a dust - on dye to cover what 's left of his locks			2
disaster : bank manager @entity3 has been forced to rely on a powder dye after his hair transplant went wrong ' i feel that everyone 's looking at me and that i look older than i am , ' he explains			1
' the powder works from a distance but if someone gets up close and personal , they can definitely see it and know something 's not right			0
' his problems began when his hair started to thin in his early twenties , receding rapidly from his hairline and crown			0
but when his hair transplant failed to take , he was left with hair that was even thinner than before - and an unpleasant set of scars to boot			1
' i thought the hair transplant was going to be worth it in the end but it did n't work out , ' he adds			1
what lies beneath : with the dye powder washed away , the true state of his hair is revealed miserable : @entity3 says that because of his receding hairline and botched transplant , he wo n't go out without a hat getting better : @entity3 has since had another hair transplant and says his mane is getting thicker the impact on his self - esteem was huge , with @entity3 admitting that for a while , it left him so low he was virtually unable to leave the house			1
' i was wearing a hat and stayed in the house as much as possible because i did n't want people to question me about it , ' he explains			2
worse , he says that despite suffering from thinning hair for almost a decade and discovering the powder , spotting his balding pate in the mirror is still enough to leave him miserable			2
' every morning i get out of bed and see this [ hair ] and it just brings my confidence right down to rock bottom			0
speaking on @entity67 documentary , @entity66 , he added : ' i just need and want to have a full head of hair			0
' happily for the 30 - year - old , it seems a solution might soon be in sight as @entity3 , although initially reluctant , has since attempted a second hair transplant in a bid to repair the damage			1
following the operation , he said : ' there 's much more hair and i can see it continually growing			0
' i can see my hair getting thicker day by day			0
in the past when i looked in the mirror , i used to cringe whereas now i 'm more happy with myself , more content			0
i 'm delighted - it has changed my life			0
' @entity3 appears on @entity66 , tonight at 8pm on @entity67			2

@entity3 , 30 , from @entity4 , had a hair transplant that made his hair even thinner
left him humiliated and *unwilling* to go out without wearing a hat
has now resorted to using a thickening powder to conceal the damage
