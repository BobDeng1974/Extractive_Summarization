by @entity0 published : 17:24 est , 29 april 2012 updated : 19:24 est , 29 april 2012 surface - to - air missiles may be stationed on top of flats as the last line of defence against a suicide jet targeting this summer ’s @entity7			1
soldiers would take over the roof of a converted factory which is home to 700 residents and has commanding views of the @entity13			1
from there , they could use a multi-million - pound laser - guided system developed for modern warzones to shoot down a helicopter attack or suicide bombers piloting an aircraft			0
vantage point : overlooking the @entity24 , the flats ( circled ) where the missiles may be deployed launch site : the @entity26 will station soldiers and high - velocity surface - to - air missiles on this residential block in @entity30 , @entity31 , to ward off airborne terror threats the range of the missiles is 3.4miles , which means they could reach @entity36 , @entity37 or parts of the @entity39 from the flats in @entity30 , @entity31			2
but the short range raised fears that dozens could be killed by falling wreckage if a target is hit			0
the move is one of the final links in a defensive ring of steel around the @entity7			1
@entity49 , the largest ship in the @entity51 , will anchor in the @entity52 to serve as a floating base for more than 800 marines			0
last line of defence : starstreak short - range missiles @entity59 jets and helicopters will patrol the skies as a 23,000 - strong force of security guards , including soldiers , bolsters up to 12,000 police officers on duty			2
news of the missile system comes just three days after an operation to deal with a suspected suicide bomber in @entity71 showcased the intimidating array of weaponry held by police in the run up to the @entity7			1
for the @entity7 , a team of ten soldiers , protected by police , will operate the starstreak missile system from the top of a former @entity82 water tower in @entity30 , 900 yards from the edge of the @entity13			1
the building forms part of a @entity87 - listed gated redevelopment of the former @entity89 match factory , where homes sell for up to £ 350,000			1
leaflets were delivered to the 700 residents at the weekend telling them the missiles would be used only as a last resort			1
the @entity95 said the presence of a military team and police protection around the clock will make them safer			0
soldiers will deploy to the building next week during a full dress rehearsal of @entity7 security , but the missile system will be loaded only with dummies			1
if it is given the go - ahead , the @entity107 system will be in position for up to two months during the @entity7 , which start in july			2
resident @entity110 , 28 , said his suspicions were raised when he saw soldiers examining the water tower a few weeks ago			2
he said : ‘ i do n’t think in a democracy the military go round occupying private property and turning it into a military base without communicating with people			0
’ local mp @entity120 said she would be raising the matter in @entity122 tomorrow			0
she said it was ‘ unprecedented ’ for missiles to be placed on residential buildings , adding : ‘ this is a heavily built - up area			0
there has been no consultation – people have been told that this is what is likely to happen and people are very worried			0
