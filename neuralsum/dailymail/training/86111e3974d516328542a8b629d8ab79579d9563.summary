by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 05:53 est , 11 april 2013 massive underground ice explosions on @entity3 have created a unique set of twin craters , it has been revealed			1
a passing @entity7 spacecraft captured the 50km wide craters , named the @entity10 twins , in january			1
they contain a unique central ' pit ' formed by underground explosions , the space agency says			1
double take : the 50km wide craters , contain a unique central ' pit ' formed by underground explosions , the @entity7 says the ‘ twin ’ craters are in the @entity19 region , a large plateau that lies immediately to the south of @entity22 , the largest canyon in the @entity23			1
' multiple terraces slump from the crater walls onto a flat floor , but perhaps the most striking feature is the central pit , a feature it shares with @entity32 crater to its north , ' said the agency			1
dramatic underground explosions , perhaps involving ice , are responsible for the pits inside these two large martian impact craters , which was imaged by @entity7 ’s @entity40 spacecraft on 4 january			1
researchers say impact craters like these can provide windows into the past of a planet ’s surface			2
' in this case , they provide evidence for the @entity19 region having once hosted plentiful subsurface water or ice that was liberated during impact events both small and large , ' it is claimed			0
a perspective view of one of the two 50 km diameter craters in @entity19			0
the image was made by combining data from the @entity57 on @entity7 's @entity40 with digital terrain models			0
this colour - coded overhead view is based on an @entity7 @entity61 digital terrain model of the crater , and reveals the relative depth of the craters the craters were formed when an asteroid hits the rocky surface of a planet , and both it and the surface are compressed to high densities			1
immediately after the impact , the compressed regions rapidly depressurise , exploding violently			0
in low - energy impacts , a simple bowl - shaped crater results			0
in more dramatic events , larger craters are produced with more complex features , such as uplifted central peaks or sunken pits			2
' one idea for central pit formation is that when rock or ice melted during the impact drains away through fractures beneath the crater , it leaves a pit , ' said @entity7			1
' another theory is that subsurface ice is rapidly heated , vapourising in an explosion			0
' as a result , the rocky surface is excavated forming an explosive pit surrounded by rocky debris			0
' the pit is in the centre of the main crater , where most of the impact energy was deposited			2
' where is it ? the area imaged on 4 january 2013 lies just south of the @entity103 region of @entity22 , in the @entity105 region of @entity3 though the large craters in this scene have similar diameters , their central pits are different in size and depth , as is clearly evident in the topographical map			1
compared to the @entity32 crater , perhaps more subsurface ice was present and more readily vapourised in the southern crater , punching through slightly thinner crust to leave a larger pit , @entity7 says			2
many neighbouring small impact craters also show evidence for subsurface water or ice at the time of impact as evidenced by their ‘ rampart ’ ejecta blankets			0
@entity128 blankets are debris deposits surrounding the crater , excavated from inside the crater during its formation			0
they have petal - like lobes around their edges : these result from liquid water bound up in the ejected material , allowing it to flow along the surface and giving it a fluid appearance .			0

each giant crater is 50km wide and contains a central ' pit ' formed during the explosions
craters are to the south of @entity22 , the largest canyon in the @entity23
