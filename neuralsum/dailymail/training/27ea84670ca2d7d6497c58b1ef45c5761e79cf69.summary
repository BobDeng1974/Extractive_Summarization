by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 07:35 est , 12 june 2013 @entity1 , 11 , has been removed from school by his mother , @entity3 after she claims he was bullied for two years a mother has removed her 11 - year - old son from school after she claims he was subjected to a two - year campaign of bullying because he has ginger hair			1
@entity10 has called in police over the treatment she claims @entity13 pupil @entity1 has suffered because of his hair colour			1
she said her son had regularly returned home from @entity17 in @entity18 , with scratches and bruises and cruel classmates called him ‘ ginger nut ’ and ‘ a skank ’			1
one day she said he returned with a black eye and on another occasion had to wear his pe shorts after being dragged through a puddle , soaking his school uniform			0
the final straw came last month when she said @entity1 was attacked on his way home from school and a member of the public had to step in to save him			1
he was pinned against a wall and punched and a bicycle was ridden over his feet			0
worried ms @entity10 , who had first alerted police last november , called them again after the incident			1
she had already taken @entity1 to a gp who told her he was ‘ depressed ’ because of what he had been suffering			2
she has now moved him out the school and accused staff of failing to tackle the bullying			2
ms @entity10 , 38 , a medical lab technician , said : ' as a parent you put your trust in the teachers when you send your children to school			1
you expect them to be looked after			0
' it ’s outrageous that @entity1 had to leave his friends behind and move to a different school and the boys that attacked him were not expelled or suspended even for just one day			1
' the school have handled this so badly			0
i do n’t want it to happen to another child			0
' @entity63 in @entity18 where it is claimed @entity1 was bullied			1
the school said it does not tolerate bullying and has a very strong anti-bullying policy ms @entity10 , a mother - of - three , added : ' i do n’t know why the bullies chose to target @entity1			1
' they would call him a skank and ginger nut because of his hair colour - it was outrageous			0
' his hair ’s not bright orange , it is more of a strawberry blonde			0
' i wonder whether it was because we did n’t live close to the school so maybe they saw @entity1 as an outsider			1
' but whatever their twisted reasons were there ’s no excuse			0
' i was so worried about him i took him to the gp and the doctor said he was depressed because of bullying			0
an 11 - year - old boy should not be made to feel depressed			1
at first the worried parent urged her boy not to take any notice and ignore the playground yobs			0
but when @entity1 was pinned up against the wall and punched on his way home ms @entity10 called in the police ' no child should have to go through what he ’s been through , especially when it ’s affecting his mental state			1
' i can not bear to imagine what @entity1 was going through being pinned up against a wall			2
' i ’m so grateful to the member of public who got out and helped him and called the school			2
' @entity1 has now moved to @entity107 in @entity108 near @entity109 , @entity110 , where he started after half term			2
his mother said : ' @entity1 is really enjoying his new school			2
it is so lovely to see him with a smile on his face			0
' we ’re lucky that his new school has worked out and i am thankful as it could have been worse			0
' @entity120 police said they were investigating the reported attack on @entity1 on may 23 and a spokesman confirmed he was left with reddening to his face and arm			2
@entity125 , head at @entity63 , said : ' we do not tolerate bullying in our school and have a very strong anti-bullying policy			1
' staff are committed to the principle that bullying , in any form , is unacceptable and we investigate fully every reported incidence or allegation of bullying , as has happened in this case			0
' we understand a complaint has been made to police following an alleged incident outside of school , and we are co-operating fully with their investigation			2
' director of bullying charity @entity143 said : ' schools are often in denial that they have a bullying problem			0
' " your child is over-sensitive " , " you are an over-protective parent " , " it ’s just children being children " , " ‘ we ca n’t do anything unless we actually see it happening " are a few of the excuses used to avoid addressing the problem			0
' the school has a duty of care to keep children safe ‘ in loco parentis ’ , they should have an anti-bullying policy by law and parents have a right to ask for a copy , to find out how the bullying will be resolved			1

@entity10 has even called in police over alleged attacks on son @entity1
she has now removed him from @entity17 in @entity18
ms @entity10 said he was subjected to a two - year campaign of bullying there
the school has said it has a robust anti-bullying policy
