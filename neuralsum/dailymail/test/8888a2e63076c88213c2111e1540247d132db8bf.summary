smoking , pregnant , covered in dirt and down - and - out - it 's not how we pictured a superhero			1
but that 's exactly how they have been imagined in this amusing photo series that reveals how the good guys could end up after their life fighting crime comes to an end			1
photographer @entity11 has snapped @entity12 , @entity13 and the @entity14 taking a step back from fighting crime and portrays how they are instead focusing on the struggles of getting through the week			1
the @entity46 - based artist of @entity48 and @entity49 heritage has produced the series of gritty portraits laced with melancholy humour in his latest project called we can be heroes			1
his subjects look like they ca n't get over the fact they 've had to retire , or like they never quite passed at superhero school			0
and now , just like many of us , their daily lives are ruled by ' simple ' struggles ; chores , providing for their loved ones , and even battling the bulge , all while fighting for their ego and trying to retain some of that hero gloss			1
@entity11 says there is a very important message to his work			2
@entity33 naps next to past - it @entity71 , @entity73 , on a dodgy , dated sofa the moody portraiture of an ironing , cigarette - smoking @entity71 echoes the troubled writer @entity77 @entity78 and @entity79 have inked up since their crime - fighting days the @entity14 , posed by @entity82 , grooms his locks , while @entity12 looks out into the distance at a cafe ' when we think of superheroes , we think of perfect bodies and beautiful faces , achieving unbelievable feats			2
these are people we idealise as characters that can do no wrong and only seem to exist in our daydreams , ' explains his work 's official description			0
' this project tries to humanise superheroes			0
despite our flaws and failures , each of us , in our own way , can be heroes to our family , our friends , our colleagues and we all have the potential to help others			0
' @entity11 's heroes are regular people not restricted by race , religion or beliefs			2
they live among us , they surround us , and they are everywhere			0
known for his unique post-shooting treatments , @entity11 effortlessly turns photography into art. with diverse shooting styles , his personal love for art , design and music keep @entity11 in touch with the world of popular culture			0
the collection has a total of 20 portraits and fine art limited edition prints , and they 're all available to purchase			0
the female @entity12 seems to have lost her mask and is using face paint instead , while smoking on the @entity134 sidewalk superman looks a long way from @entity137 as he glares over the balcony of his high - rise home , while @entity140 strums a guitar as a busker following her career fighting crime the @entity145 fixes up a beat up old car in @entity147 in this shot of his second career as a mechanic the female flash , posed by @entity152 , is now a sullen children 's party entertainer and @entity154 , posed by @entity155 , is still trying to look important wonder women ( mother and daughter ) @entity159 and @entity160 look out onto a queue of people while enjoying a cigarette the @entity164 , meanwhile , posed by @entity11 , has certainly lost most of his massive muscle ( although can still break down fences )			1
