@entity0 still so far from the top four it was the same old story for @entity0 at @entity2			1
they have now conceded 26 goals in their last seven games against the champions			1
they want to get back in the top four but at the moment they could not be further from it			2
they have struggled ever since they sold @entity13 and most of the men they brought in have not been good enough			1
@entity16 got a lot of stick for not signing players but they have spent the best part of £ 100million on @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity25 was again under par during @entity0 's 4 - 1 defeat by @entity2 on saturday @entity28 ( right ) gave yet another disappointing performance in a @entity0 shirt @entity16 's £ 16m signing @entity23 rescued a point with a late equaliser against @entity34 @entity22 , who joined @entity16 from @entity35 for £ 30m , opened the scoring against the @entity37 those are ambitious signings of proven quality			1
spurs have spent plenty of money but how many of those transfers were for top - class players ? @entity28 has not lived up to his billing and clearly @entity25 is not the answer up front			1
they still look short at centre half , too			2
@entity49 gave away a penalty at @entity2 — exactly what you do n’t want your captain to do — and the rest just could not cope with @entity55			1
@entity0 have paid a lot of money for an awful lot of players			1
i just hope they kept the receipt			2
it 's a shootout for the title that was some performance by @entity55			1
he was absolutely magnificent against @entity0 and with @entity2 and @entity68 the two favourites for the title , it could come down to a shootout between @entity55 and @entity72			1
watching both of them play at @entity74 , i always felt they could score goals in the @entity77			2
they have started this season in electric form with nine goals each			2
the only problem is they are prone to muscle injuries			2
with both sides looking good , it could come down to which striker stays fit enough to fire his team to the title			1
@entity2 's @entity55 ( left ) and @entity68 's @entity72 ( right ) both have nine goals this season @entity55 scored all four goals in @entity2 's 4 - 1 win over @entity0 at the @entity94 @entity95 had his best day - @entity96 @entity98 's first column of the season , tipping @entity101 's @entity100 to do well saints march on at the start of the season there was a lot of worry around @entity100			1
people were questioning if they could survive relegation , let alone perform to the same levels as last season			2
i always thought they would be fine but they have been so good i have had to write about them almost every week ! they were brilliant against @entity115 , even though @entity117 ’s side were absolutely woeful			2
they have a good squad and with @entity120 supplying @entity121 , they always look like scoring			1
i loved that even after scoring so many goals @entity101 still wanted more			1
he was urging his team to get forward and it was the perfect all - round performance			2
@entity100 recorded a thumping 8 - 0 victory over @entity115 to continue their strong start to the season @entity129 you ca n’t help but be impressed by @entity132 ’s firepower at the moment			1
@entity134 and @entity135 have come in and immediately been banging in the goals			1
at £ 12million you would expect @entity138 to produce the goods but @entity135 has been a revelation			1
last season he was scoring goals for @entity142 in the @entity144 second division but his pace and power make him the perfect fit for the @entity77			1
he cost just £ 3.5million and is the kind of player every manager dreams of discovering			2
credit to @entity156 and co-chairmen @entity157 and @entity158 because with six goals in his last six games , @entity135 looks worth his weight in gold			1
@entity135 ( left ) is congratulated by @entity161 after giving @entity132 the lead at @entity163 a @entity165 show from @entity166 nobody came out of the row over @entity169 with any credit			1
thankfully on sunday he gave us a reminder of just why we should all really be talking about him			2
i was at @entity175 and @entity165 put in a wonderful display			2
he had energy , was zipping past people and at times looked like he could run through a puddle without making a splash			0
he is a special player and the last thing we want is for him to start feeling that playing for @entity183 is a chore when it ’s a privilege			0
any future issues have to be kept in house because he is a prized asset to be nurtured , not criticised			0
@entity169 was back in @entity190 's starting xi for their 3 - 2 victory against @entity192 at @entity175 only two teams in the top seven tiers of @entity196 football are still undefeated this season - @entity68 and @entity197			0
more brilliance from @entity199 what a job @entity200 is doing at @entity197			0
he has an intense way of working but it ’s obviously doing the trick			0
a win against @entity205 means they already have a five - point lead at the top of @entity209 and remain unbeaten			0
@entity199 is something of a sleeping giant as a football city , but @entity200 is doing his best to wake them up			0
@entity200 's @entity197 side beat @entity205 3 - 1 on saturday to remain unbeaten and top of @entity209 bright futures on saturday i went with a friend of mine to watch his lad play for @entity68 ’s under 7s team			0
it was so good to see so many young kids with lovely skill and technique			0
one boy in particular really looked the part			0
he stepped up and took two corners — one with his left foot and one with his right			0
he was so comfortable with both feet and it was a real pleasure to see that in a young kid			0
people often complain that we do n’t produce technically gifted youngsters in this country but there ’s no reason why we ca n’t			0
watching those kids on saturday , it was reassuring to know that they were being developed in just the right way			0
10 - despite their 4 - 1 drubbing , @entity0 showed good attacking intent against @entity2			1
@entity96 ’s side had 10 shots at goal in the first half at the @entity94 , including blocked shots			0
that ’s the most by any team against @entity2 so far this season and no team had more than 10 in the whole of last season - @entity100 matched that total in december 2013			1
8 - since the start of last season , @entity258 ’s @entity257 has scored eight league goals , more than any other defender in the same time frame			0
@entity257 scores @entity258 's third goal in their 3 - 0 win against @entity266 at @entity267 4 - @entity268 has now scored four goals in five @entity77 games			0
that ’s the same as his total last year and he has never scored more than four in a @entity77 season			0
700th - @entity132 's 3 - 1 win at @entity163 was their 700th game in the @entity77			1
they are only the ninth team to reach that total after @entity16 , @entity266 , @entity68 , @entity258 , @entity190 , @entity0 , @entity278 and @entity279			1
1st - @entity190 's 3 - 2 win at @entity175 was the first time in their @entity77 history that they have benefited from two own goals in the same game			0
centre halves @entity285 and @entity287 were the unlucky pair for @entity192			0
@entity190 beat @entity192 3 - 2 at @entity175 , but were helped by two own goals from the home side 1982 - @entity115 's 8 - 0 hammering at @entity100 was their heaviest league defeat since an 8 - 0 loss to @entity294 in september 1982			0
2012 - @entity295 scored his first league goal for @entity279 since february 2012 , when he scored in a 2 - 0 win at @entity298			0
it ended a run of 24 games without a goal			0
@entity295 scored the only goal as @entity279 beat @entity304 1 - 0 at @entity305			0

@entity0 were thrashed by @entity2 once again
spurs have *n't* spent *wisely* after *selling* @entity13 to @entity309
@entity16 have invested in players of proven quality , such as @entity22
title race could be a shootout between @entity72 and @entity55
