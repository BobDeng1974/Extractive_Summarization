@entity2 and @entity3 spies reportedly stole confidential codes from @entity6 sim card manufacturer to eavesdrop on mobile phones around the world , an intelligence leak has revealed			1
@entity10 whistleblower @entity9 gave leaked files to @entity12 detailing how the @entity3 agency and its @entity2 counterparts @entity13 stole encryption keys that keep mobile communications private			1
the company targeted was @entity19 who produce billions of electronic chips for mobile phones and next generation credit cards			1
it operates in 85 countries and its sim cards cover more than 1.5 billion mobile users globally for clients such as @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
the hacks are thought to have taken place in 2010 and 2011 and led to the theft of 300,000 keys from @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			1
sim heist : @entity13 slides revealed the spy agency wanted to steal encryption keys which help keep mobile communications private security breech : @entity13 also planted ' malicious software ' on @entity19 's computers to obtain encryption keys and boasted in a slide : ' @entity55 implanted several machines and believe we have their entire network ' phone intercepts : leaked documents given to @entity12 by @entity10 whistleblower @entity9 ( pictured ) revealed how the @entity3 agency and @entity2 - based @entity13 hacked into a @entity6 company with these encryption keys , the intelligence agencies would have the ability to collect both voice and data information - such as text messages - from a large portion of the world 's communications			1
the keys are used to decipher the communications between mobile phones and their network providers which would otherwise be received as a ' garbled mess '			2
stealing them also sidesteps the need to get permission from telecom companies or a warrant for a wire - tap - and it leaves no trace on the wireless provider 's network that communications have been hacked into			2
the intercept claims @entity13 planted malicious software on several of @entity19 's computers to gain access to its internal network in order to obtain these keys			1
it also received slides from @entity13 in which the author boasted : ' @entity97 implanted several machines and believe we have their entire network			0
' the encrypted connection between a mobile device and its wireless network is what keeps the communications private			0
and all mobile communications on a phone depend on the sim card which guards this encryption key			1
in some countries , the electronic chips are even used to transfer money safely			0
an encryption key known as a ' @entity114 ' is burned onto them when they are manufactured and a copy of this key is also given to the mobile provider , which is how they recognise a phone on its network			0
when a mobile connects to its wireless provider - and the @entity114 's match up - it creates a ' secret handshake ' which is encrypted			2
even if @entity13 intercepted the phone call , it would be interpreted as a garbled mess			0
but by stealing the encryption keys , it can decrypt this information and essentially listen into the phone calls and intercept text messages			1
a document from the @entity10 revealed the @entity3 agency could process between 12 and 22 million keys by 2009 , which could later be used to spy on targets			1
it predicted that more than 50 million keys could be accessed every second in the future			0
the @entity13 's operation to target @entity19 was called ' @entity144 ' and in 2011 , it launched an attempt to harvest the email accounts of @entity19 employees in @entity148 and @entity149			1
a top - secret document said one of the aims of the operation was ' getting into @entity148 hq ' of @entity19 - one of its global headquarters - ' to get into core data repositories '			2
it also wanted to intercept the private communications of employees in @entity149 which ' could lead to penetration into one or more ' of the factories where the encryption keys were burned onto the sim cards			1
another @entity13 document from may 2011 indicated it was in the process of ' targeting ' more than a dozen @entity19 facilities across the globe including in @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity41 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179			1
the file also suggested @entity13 was preparing similar key theft operations against one of @entity19 's competitors - @entity169 sim card giants @entity185 and @entity186			1
it also penetrated ' authentication servers ' which allow it to decrypt data and voice communications between a target 's mobile phone and the connection it makes with its network provider			2
an accompanying slide read : ' very happy with the data so far and working through the vast quantity of product			0
' oblivious : @entity19 was unaware of the hack and the spying on its employees according to its executive vice president @entity202 , who told the intercept : ' i 'm disturbed , quite concerned that this has happened ' line of duty : a @entity13 spokesperson said : ' all of @entity13 's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework , which ensures that our activities are authorised , necessary and proportionate ' as part of the covert operations against @entity19 , spies from @entity13 who were supported by the @entity10 mined the private communications of unwitting engineers and other company employees in multiple countries			1
@entity19 was unaware of the hack and the spying on its employees according to its executive vice president @entity202			2
the company which brought in Â£ 1.7billion in revenue in 2013 - and provides sim cards for billions of people - is a global leader in digital security , producing banking cards , mobile payment systems , two - factor authentication devices used for online security , hardware tokens used for securing buildings and offices , electronic passports and identification cards			1
the @entity6 multi-national , whose motto is ' security to be free ' provides chips to @entity243 in @entity244 , @entity148 's @entity245 and @entity246 in the @entity2			2
@entity247 , the largest @entity6 wireless network provider , also uses @entity19 technology			0
in @entity250 , @entity19 's chips are used by @entity251 , @entity178 's @entity252 and @entity254 's @entity253 , as well as scores of wireless network providers throughout @entity257 and the @entity258			1
the company 's security technology is used by more than 3,000 financial institutions and 80 government organizations			0
among its clients are @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268			0
it also provides chips for use in luxury cars , including those made by @entity273 and @entity274			0
he told the intercept : ' i 'm disturbed , quite concerned that this has happened			0
' the most important thing for me is to understand exactly how this was done , so we can take every measure to ensure that it does n't happen again , and also to make sure that there 's no impact on the telecom operators that we have served in a very trusted manner for many years			0
' what i want to understand is what sort of ramifications it has , or could have , on any of our customers			0
' a spokesperson from @entity13 said it does not comment on intelligence matters , but added : ' all of @entity13 's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework , which ensures that our activities are authorised , necessary and proportionate , and that there is rigorous oversight , including from the @entity303 , the @entity304 and intelligence services commissioners and the parliamentary intelligence and security committee			2
' all our operational processes rigorously support this position			0
in addition , the @entity2 's interception regime is entirely compatible with the @entity311			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity19 said the manufacturer has so far ' made no links ' between previous hacking attempts it was already aware of and the new reports			0
she said : ' we take this publication very seriously and will devote all resources necessary to fully investigate and understand the scope of such highly sophisticated technique to try to obtain sim card data			0
' there have been many reported state sponsored attacks as of late , that all have gained attention both in the media and amongst businesses , this truly emphasises how serious cyber security is in this day and age			0
