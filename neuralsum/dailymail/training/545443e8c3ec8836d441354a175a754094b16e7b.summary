by @entity0 a thug who brutally attacked six women - including his own sister and a girl who refused to kiss him at a party - has got off with a 14 - month sentence			1
the judge said @entity8 , 22 , deserved longer behind bars but he was restricted by official sentencing guidelines after the attacks were charged lower - level common assaults			1
victims groups have criticised the sentence , saying it shows how rules need to be changed to allow the justice system to impose the punishments criminals deserve			2
thug @entity8 ( left ) attacked six women in a spate of assaults - but was only jailed for 14 months today			1
judge @entity22 ( right ) agreed that the sentence was too soft , but said he was bound by sentencing guidelines the court heard @entity8 , of @entity26 , @entity27 , attacked four women in a late night attack in september , before beating up his sister in november , and punching another victim at a party in february this year			1
he admitted six counts of common assault and breaching a suspended sentence			1
but judge @entity22 said @entity8 could only be jailed for a maximum of six months for the attacks as they were classed as low level ' summary offences ' , which he pleaded guilty to before magistrates			1
@entity8 was only jailed for the longer term of 14 months because the judge activated a previously suspended prison sentence from when @entity8 crashed a car into a care home			1
sentencing rules also mean that , providing he behaves behind bars , @entity8 could be released on licence after serving just half of his prison term			1
domestic violence charity @entity53 hit out at the sentence and called for the system to be changed so the punishment can fits the crime			1
@entity60 @entity59 heard that the judge was limited in the sentence he could impose because the attacks were charged as ' summary ' common assaults spokesman @entity66 : ' it is really worrying			1
the justice system needs to be reviewed in individual cases like this so the courts can actually give out sentences that reflect the catalogue of abuse that he has obviously carried out			0
' guidelines state that the ' summary offence ' of common assault has a maximum sentence of six months			1
they encourage judges to impose a community order unless the offence involves a ' greater degree of harm '			0
longer sentences of up to five years can only be imposed if the attack is charged as an ' assault occasioning actual bodily harm ( @entity89 ) '			1
guidelines tell prosecutors to decide upon a charge based on ' the level of injuries that have resulted '			0
last september , @entity8 lashed out at four young women at 3am after a run - in with one of the group			1
he landed punches on each of the women 's faces , leaving them with nosebleeds , swelling and pain which lasted for several days			2
one said she was ' shocked that such a large man would assault girls in such a way '			2
he had previously attacked his sister when she and his mum refused to hand over his six - month - old baby when he came home drunk from the pub. @entity114 , prosecuting , said : ' he grabbed his sister from behind and dragged her to the floor by her hair			1
' he punched and kicked her about the body and stamped on her several times			2
' @entity120 ' final attack was committed on a girl he tried to kiss at a house party			1
when she rejected him , he ran at her and punched her to the mouth , nose and forehead causing her to fall to the floor , the court heard			0
she suffered a burst lip , black eye and bruising around her mouth			0
one of his victims said in a statement : ' i think it 's disgusting that he would do that to girls			0
he 's a bully and needs to learn he ca n't do that			0
' @entity140 , mitigating , said : ' when sober he 's straight forward and rational			0
his family speak well of him when he is not in drink			0
' judge @entity22 said : ' i 'm limited in the sentence that i can impose unfortunately because the appropriate sentence would be considerably higher and greater than that which i 'm allowed to impose			0
' @entity8 's case is just the latest in recent weeks to spark anger among campaigners			2
earlier this month , killer @entity151 ( pictured ) walked free from court despite threatening the son of his former wife , @entity154 , after he was released from prison having served less than four years for her manslaughter			2
campaigners @entity157 branded the six - month suspended sentence the 63 - year - old was given ' a scandalously feeble response			1
' the group 's @entity162 said : ' the suspended sentence might as well have been an absolute discharge			0
' it came after a judge apologised to the latest victims of armed robber @entity169 after he was released on licence from a second life sentence			0
@entity169 was given his third life term for a robbery of a @entity175 bookmakers last month , but judge @entity176 admitted she should never have been freed at all			0
he said to the victims : ' i wish to apologise to them on behalf of the criminal justice system for placing them in that position			0
' @entity183 , director of the @entity184 , said of the judge 's comments : ' this is a rare and brave example of a judge pointing out that soft sentences put the public at huge risk			0
' it was also revealed last month that four out of five serial burglars now avoid prison or get off with short sentences			2
of the 993 serial burglars who were dealt with by the courts in 2011 , only 214 were jailed for three years or more , figures show the soft punishments were handed out despite a statement by then - lord chief justice @entity201 in 2009 urging judges to recognise the seriousness of burglary			2
he said : â€˜ something precious is violated by burglary of a home and those who perpetrate this crime should be sentenced and punished accordingly			0

@entity8 assaulted a group of women in a late - night attack
the 22 - year - old also stamped on his sister after she tried to *protect* his baby
he also punched a woman at a party when she refused to kiss him
@entity201 said he deserved a longer prison stretch than the 14 - month imposed
he was *powerless* to *increase* it after attacks charged as ' common assault '
domestic violence charity says the case shows changes to *law* are needed
