this time were no dramatic tears from @entity2			1
the @entity4 striker was n’t even on the field , left idle by a knee injury that is clearly worse than @entity7 ever hoped			0
make no mistake about it , though , this was another night to rip the heart out of the @entity11			0
first the @entity13 title slipped from his grasp on that awful night at @entity16			0
now his @entity17 looks as though it may stall before it 's even begun			0
inspired by young @entity66 forward @entity61 , they got exactly what they deserved and it is clear that they will move forwards to face @entity73 and then @entity7 fearing absolutely no - one			1
a goal down to an early @entity33 penalty , @entity22 prefaced the start of the second half with a group huddle			1
afterwards , coach @entity79 talked of his team 's ' emotional serenity '			0
whatever was said clearly worked as @entity79 ’s team were so superior to @entity18 for the second 45 minutes it was quite startling			2
goals from inspirational young @entity66 striker @entity61 and then from the superb @entity54 and late substitute @entity86 left @entity18 reeling and significantly @entity2 was not brought on , even as his team started to chase the game			1
@entity2 is clearly not fit and there has to be huge question mark now over his participation against @entity92 make matters worse , right back @entity51 was sent off in injury time for a dreadful hack at young @entity61 near the corner flag			1
he will miss the @entity7 game , too			0
head boy : @entity54 ( left ) scores to make it 2 - 1 to @entity22 before celebrating ( below , left ) @entity54 afterwards @entity18 coach @entity99 was contradictory when he provided his now customary update on @entity2 ’s state of health			1
' @entity2 is fit , ' he said			2
' if he was n’t he would n’t have been on the bench			0
he has gone through the phases we have foreseen and we will see what happens now			0
' we have four days before the @entity7 game so we will see if there is a possibility he may play			0
' without the prolific @entity2 , @entity18 still looked to have more than enough to hurt unfancied @entity111 opponents			1
indeed , things went to plan for most of the first half			0
@entity33 did miss a good chance early on , slashing wildly at a volley when unmarked , but he soon recovered to despatch a penalty when his captain @entity39 was dragged down by @entity56			1
@entity18 looked set to take firm control of the game			2
maybe they would have had @entity22 goalkeeper @entity52 not produced the save of the @entity17 so far to touch over a heavily deflected shot from @entity122 just before half - time			2
ca n't believe it : @entity2 ( right ) was an unused substitute as @entity18 crashed to defeat just before the break , however , there were some signs that @entity22 had something to offer			1
@entity61 drove a shot inches wide from distance while @entity44 almost nudged home a corner at the far post			2
as the game wore on , so @entity18 's susceptibility at aerial set pieces became clear			2
afterwards , @entity79 revealed he had identified it in the build - up			0
certainly , @entity18 suffered in the second half			2
the equaliser arrived soon after half - time			0
the build - up down the right was nice enough but the cross was rather hopeful			0
only when two @entity18 defenders got in each other 's way did it become an opportunity and @entity61 lashed the ball home from 12 yards with his right foot			1
level best : @entity61 ( centre ) scores to equalise for @entity22 against @entity18 comeback trail : @entity61 celebrates scoring @entity22 's first goal with so long left in the game , the goal seemed to represent nothing more than a curiosity			1
@entity18 had plenty of time to gather themselves and come again			2
as it turned out , the opposite happened in front of 58,000 increasingly frenzied supporters at the @entity165			0
it was @entity22 who grew in strength and again @entity18 were found out in the air as @entity54 escaped the rather slack attentions of @entity171 at the far post to stoop bravely and head across goal in to the far corner			1
@entity18 immediately made two substitutions but @entity2 was not among them			1
briefly they rallied , @entity33 bringing a save from @entity178 with a header			0
three and easy : @entity180 scores past @entity18 's @entity37 to make it 3 - 1 to @entity22 ecstasy : @entity180 is mobbed by his team - mates are scoring the goal that clinched victory for @entity18 hacked : @entity186 ends @entity61 ( centre ) leading to a melee between the players ( below ) ugly scenes : @entity51 ( centre ) is sent off for kicking @entity61 ( right ) marching orders : @entity51 leaves the pitch and heads for the tunnel after being sent off late on dejected : @entity18 's players walk off at full time knowing how damaging defeat was perfect start : @entity22 fans celebrate a famous win for their country ultimately , though , it was the irrepressible @entity203 team that struck the decisive blow with six minutes left			1
substitute @entity86 had only been on the field four minutes when he was released down the right			1
there really should n’t have been too much danger but goalkeeper @entity37 dashed unwisely from goal and @entity86 slid the ball past him with some ease from an angle that initially looked to be against him			0

@entity18 had taken the lead through an @entity33 penalty
@entity61 , @entity54 and @entity86 scored for @entity22
@entity2 was an unused substitute for @entity18
