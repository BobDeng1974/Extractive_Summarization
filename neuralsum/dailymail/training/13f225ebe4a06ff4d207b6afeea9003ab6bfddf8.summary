i was there and i saw the faces of prince @entity49 and [ @entity51 ] @entity50 , and they were shocked			0
' prince @entity49 was left ‘ bitterly disappointed ’ in 2010 as he , @entity50 and @entity53 watched @entity3 win just two votes despite having privately secured the pledges of at least five @entity2 delegates			1
the trio felt ‘ lied to ’ , according to one @entity3 bid member who said it was ‘ embarrassing that @entity49 and the prime minister have lent their good names ’ to the project			0
