by @entity0 @entity1 could do the unthinkable and join @entity2 at @entity3 this summer , according to a source close to the @entity6 manager			1
@entity7 will hold talks with @entity3 about becoming their next manager - and he could bring @entity10 legend @entity1 with him to @entity11			1
@entity1 has enjoyed huge success working as @entity7 's assistant - @entity6 wrapped up the @entity14 title last weekend - and the fomer @entity16 team - mates could once again link up at @entity11			1
while it is an unthinkable prospect for @entity10 fans , @entity14 football journalist @entity38 recently spoke with @entity7 and said it is ' possible ' that @entity1 could link up again with his boss in north @entity35			2
asked whether @entity7 would bring @entity1 and @entity43 , the former @entity44 defender who is also his assistant at @entity6 , with him to @entity3 , @entity38 refused to rule out such a move			1
' i have to laugh because i know @entity10 - the team of @entity1 - and @entity3 are not best friends , ' he told @entity48			2
' @entity43 , for example , is working with @entity2 and he 's ( supposed to be ) going to @entity50 - but maybe he 's coming with @entity7 to @entity51			1
' maybe also he will bring some players to @entity51 , players like @entity53 , the son of former @entity6 captain @entity54			0
' so it 's all possible			0
' approach : @entity6 boss @entity2 will wait to the end of the season to talk to @entity3 on top : @entity7 , 43 , secured his fourth @entity62 title in a row with a draw at @entity65 on sunday assistant : @entity10 legend @entity1 ( pictured right with @entity43 , left ) is assistant to @entity7 @entity1 still has huge affection for @entity10 , while members of the club ’s hierarchy have earmarked him as a possible future @entity33 boss			1
and given his emotional ties with @entity10 , it seems highly unlikely @entity1 would agree to join bitter rivals @entity3			2
but the 44 - year - old @entity77 legend has formed a strong working relationship with @entity7 , winning three consecutive @entity62 titles together			0
spurs have begun identifying candidates to replace current boss @entity17 , who is set to leave this summer			0
club legend : a statue of @entity1 stands outside @entity10 's @entity37 @entity7 is a favourite among the @entity3 hierarchy , and speaking on @entity14 tv on tuesday the @entity16 legend confirmed the club ’s interest			1
@entity3 ’s intention to discuss the managerial role with @entity7 was made directly to @entity6 director of football @entity92			2
' @entity3 have n’t had contact with my agent yet			0
they have approached @entity6 , but that ’s it , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ @entity3 have let @entity6 know they would eventually talk to me when the season ’s finished			2
‘ after the last league game ( against @entity100 on saturday ) i ’ll think about it , ’ said @entity7			0
‘ i ’ll talk to them and listen to what they have to say			0
i would like to add something to a club like @entity107 did at @entity108			0
‘ i see a perspective at @entity3 , just as @entity108 and @entity111 sometimes are , they are sleeping giants .			0

@entity2 says @entity3 have approached @entity6 over his *services*
@entity7 says he will talk to @entity3 after the @entity14 season ends on saturday
assistants @entity1 and @entity43 could join him at @entity3
the @entity14 led @entity6 to their fourth title in a row at the weekend
former @entity125 star hopes to emulate @entity108 's @entity107
