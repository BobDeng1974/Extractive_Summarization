mr @entity0 and other world leaders will go to the @entity27 first , before joining the rally			2
mr @entity0 's decision to attend the rally on sunday comes after security chiefs warned that @entity32 was also being targeted by @entity18 terrorists			1
@entity35 chief @entity34 said the terror group was plotting spectacular ' mass casualty ' attacks on the @entity32			1
following the warning , the chancellor @entity39 said he had handed the security services a new £ 100million anti-terror fund to track @entity32 lone - wolf extremists			1
mr @entity39 said the cash had been handed over ' in the last few weeks ' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from @entity48 and @entity49 to wreak terror in @entity32			1
he said the government would provide @entity35 and @entity52 with ' all the resources and all the legislation ' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in @entity32			1
but mr @entity34 , the director - general of @entity35 , said it was almost inevitable that an attack in @entity32 would succeed sooner or later			1
warning : @entity34 ( pictured ) , the director - general of @entity35 , said it was almost inevitable an attack in @entity32 would succeed sooner or later the chancellor pledged to provide @entity35 and @entity52 with ' all the resources and all the legislation ' they need he said @entity18 was directing @entity32 - based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a @entity68 - style gun and bomb atrocities			1
in a rare public speech , mr @entity34 warned : ' although we and our partners try our utmost , we know that we can not hope to stop everything			2
' mr @entity34 's speech , only his second since taking charge in april 2013 , warned that the @entity32 was facing a string of ' complex and ambitious plots ' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks			1
in response to the attack on the @entity1 - based satirical magazine on wednesday , mr @entity39 said the threat to the @entity32 was ' severe ' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed			1
he said : ' it 's clearly a big challenge for all countries including @entity32 and we face a terrorist threat			1
we have a severe terrorist threat ; that is our national state of readiness			2
' we have put a huge amount of planning and effort , from the police , from the security services , from the government into anticipating what might try and happen , stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year			1
' in the last few weeks we have put extra money , over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in @entity49 and @entity48			2
' these sort of self - starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes , so we are putting a huge effort in			2
' as the director general of @entity35 said over the last 24 hours , that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots			1
' armed @entity32 police patrol @entity117 in @entity119 , where the @entity121 train runs to @entity1 fanatics wish to emulate ' crude ' attacks carried out overseas in recent months			1
chillingly , tactics could include a ' hit - and - run ' on a crowded public place using a lorry , van or car			2
unlike gun or bomb plots , which involves buying weapons or equipment , such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect			1
at least three plots which would have involved ' certain deaths ' in @entity32 have been foiled in recent months , mr @entity34 said			2
officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 @entity32 extremists who have travelled to @entity49 – about 300 of who are now back home			2
mr @entity39 promised that the security services would get ' all the resources and all the legislation ' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the @entity32			1
' we have got to be vigilant , we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear			2
this is the national priority			0
we will put the resources in , whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf			1
' they often do n't get praise , they do n't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support			0
' ' our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently , it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment , that an attack is highly likely			0
' so , we have to be ready for that			0
we do n't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level , but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared			0
we have had terrible incidents on our streets			0
' mr @entity39 's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to @entity32 was now ' as serious as it has ever been ' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics			1
former foreign secretary sir @entity194 , the chairman of the joint intelligence committee , said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks			1
he said : ' what is emerging in @entity1 is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at @entity10 , may have been linked to @entity18 in @entity205			1
' now they must have ben communicating with people in the @entity205 over the last few days , over the last few weeks			0
' the highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in @entity32 , @entity5 and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind			1
' patrols stepped up : armed @entity217 officers stand next to the @entity121 platforms at @entity117 railway station there is also growing concern about the threat posed by @entity224 fights returning to the @entity32			2

' he added : ' some of these people were not innocent			0
the editor who makes the cartoons			0
he has no right to make cartoons or the prophet			0
he has no right to say @entity235 is bad			0
