by @entity0 published : 15:07 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 11:18 est , 7 june 2012 @entity1 has announced a complete overhaul to the imagery on @entity4			2
the search giant has sent a convoy of planes over major cities in the world , each plane capturing advanced @entity12 information and detailed photographs			0
the result will be a complete @entity12 experience of major cities across the world , allowing users to swoop and fly through replicas which are exact - with even trees getting the 3d treatment			1
it is the next step of @entity1 's controversial plan to create a photo - based map of the world - and it will begin rolling out before the end of the year			0
@entity1 is also planning to introduce offline support to @entity4 , in a bid to offset the expected loss of traffic from @entity31 and @entity32 users , with @entity33 set to launch their own competitor to @entity4			1
both @entity35 and a technology blog called 9to5 have reported that @entity33 next week will make a move to drop @entity4 , which currently comes pre-loaded on all @entity31 and @entity32 products			1
the leak suggests the company plans to use next week 's @entity52 to announce @entity4 as the built - in option on its mobile platform			1
@entity1 mapping executive @entity55 did n't directly address questions about the potential @entity33 setback , simply saying that @entity1 wants to make its maps available in as many places as possible			2
he also declined to name the cities getting the treatment , but it showed a demonstration of a @entity12 map of @entity45 , in which a user can navigate around an aerial view of the city			0
from previous experience , @entity1 usually gives the early treatment to @entity45 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , among others			0
@entity55 , said the company was using a fleet of airplanes owned and operated by contractors and flying exclusively for @entity1			0
@entity81 , a product manager for @entity41 , said : ' we 're trying to create the illusion that you 're just flying over the city , almost as if you were in your own personal helicopter			1
' the 3d maps are expected to arrive by the end of the year , and offline support for @entity91 devices may arrive within the next few weeks			2
@entity1 plans to release the maps by the end of the year , but has n't revealed which cities will be captured asked about potential privacy implications , @entity55 said the privacy issues were similar to all aerial imagery			2
@entity1 has for years operated a fleet of camera - equipped cars that crisscross the globe taking panoramic pictures of streets for its mapping service			0
the cars have raised privacy concerns in some countries			0
if @entity33 ousts @entity4 as a built - in option on the @entity31 and @entity32 , it would be the latest fissure between two former allies			1
their relationship has been degenerating into a bitter rivalry since @entity1 's 2008 release of its @entity91 software to compete against @entity33 's @entity31			1
since then , both companies have increasingly been encroaching on each other 's turf			0
@entity1 's mapping service has been a featured app in @entity33 's mobile operating system since the @entity31 's debut five years ago			1
processing the mobile mapping requests from users of @entity33 's devices provided @entity1 with valuable insights into people 's whereabouts and preferences			2
that , in turn , helped @entity1 sell more ads to local businesses .			0

' your own personal helicopter ' : new version of maps will let you dive round exact 3d replicas of cities

@entity147 comes just as @entity33 ' plans to ditch @entity4 on the @entity31 and @entity32 '
