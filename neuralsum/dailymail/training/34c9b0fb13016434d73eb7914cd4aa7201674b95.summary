@entity0 has revealed he failed in a bid to bring @entity3 striker @entity2 to @entity4 at the start of the season			1
the @entity4 boss takes his side to @entity9 on saturday to face a @entity3 team buoyed by the goals of @entity2 so far this campaign			1
the @entity13 under 21 international has struck 11 goals for @entity16 's men but has only established himself in @entity3 's @entity18 side in the last month			1
@entity2 ( left ) in action against @entity20 was a loan target for @entity4 last summer until then he was used sparingly as a substitute and restricted to playing a key role in the @entity25 group stages - the main reason @entity0 felt a loan move for @entity2 never got off the ground			1
' i tried to get him a few times when i came here , ' the 66 - year - old said			2
' he is a good lad and you know what you are going to get with him			2
he is an exciting player			0
his first thought when he gets the ball is positive and i like players like that , who commit defenders			0
he obviously enjoys it , you can tell by the smile on his face			0
he is a good asset			0
@entity4 boss @entity0 was disappointed to miss out on @entity46 21 international @entity2 ' at the time , he was not involved and we felt there was a chance of getting him on loan			1
but unfortunately they were in that horrible cup on a thursday night			0
' @entity2 came close to breaking the deadlock as @entity3 lost 3 - 0 at league leaders @entity20 on wednesday night and is likely to retain his place for the visit of @entity4 , who also go into the contest on the back of a defeat having lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity63			1
midfielder @entity64 missed that game with a hip problem and is a doubt for the trip to @entity3 - as is defender @entity69			2
@entity2 ( left ) , pictured tussling with @entity70 , has now established himself in @entity3 's first - team @entity0 admitted he has already drawn up a list of january transfer targets and , having missed out on @entity2 , it is a forward - with @entity75 and @entity76 injured and @entity77 replaced at half - time against @entity63 through illness - that he hopes to bring in			1
' i think we know we have n't got enough fire - power , ' he added			2
' when you look at the other teams they have all got main strikers to select from			0
i think the lads are doing as well as they can			0
we do need improvement in that area and we are looking to address that in january			0

@entity4 *attempted* to sign @entity2 on loan in *august*
but @entity3 were *unwilling* to let the striker leave for @entity95
@entity2 has since established himself in @entity16 's first - team
