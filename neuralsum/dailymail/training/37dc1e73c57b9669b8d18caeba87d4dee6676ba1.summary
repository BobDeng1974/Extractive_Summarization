in an email to staff , mr @entity25 said : ' i recognise that there is a difference between full - time positions and the number of people who fill them : given that we are an organisation where there is a high degree of job sharing and part - time working , i expect that closer to 500 people may be affected by these job closures			1
@entity79 general secretary @entity78 said the cuts will further undermine the ability of journalists to deliver quality content ' the redundancy process itself will mean pools of people are put at risk			2
i appreciate that this means an even larger number of people face uncertainty over the coming weeks			0
i would also stress that all of the changes are subject to consultation in the coming weeks			0

@entity79 general secretary @entity78 said : ' these cuts will further undermine the ability of journalists to deliver quality content			0
' the way in which the @entity1 wants to carry out the redundancies is the latest move from a management whose approach to recruitment is to grab a coffee with their pals and find them a berth without so much as an interview , doling out jobs with salaries that are way in excess of the normal rates			0
