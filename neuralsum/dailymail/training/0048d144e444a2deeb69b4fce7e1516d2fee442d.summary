with a single fist in the air , this is how mourners chose to say a final farewell to @entity6 editor @entity5 at his funeral in @entity8 today			1
surviving cartoonist @entity9 , who drew this week 's cover featuring the @entity11 , bowed his head and wept as he raised his tattooed wrist aloft			1
the defiant gesture is a fitting send - off for @entity5 , a man who dedicated his life to living in opposition and once declared : ' i would rather die standing than live on my knees '			1
the son of a postal worker father and secretary mother , he grew up in @entity30 , an historic arrondissement several miles to the north of his birthplace , and synonymous with impressionist art. at one time @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , all either lived or worked in the picturesque district , and painted its landscape			1
during the service tributes were read to the man who helped revive @entity6 in 1992 along with @entity60 , who was also killed last week the prestigious heritage certainly rubbed off on @entity62 , who drew from a young age			0
his first drawings were published in a student magazine when he was just 14			2
he went to study at the @entity53 , a art college close to his home which counted the impressionist among its patrons when it opened in 1959			0
after graduating he went on to study advertising , but broke off that career when he was invited to work on satirical magazine @entity75 - which translates as @entity77 , named after the formidable @entity80 @entity79 artillery piece			0
he joined the magazine in 1991 , and made his debut as @entity35 with a cartoon opposing the first @entity84			0
he served just a year on @entity86 's staff before a row over the magazine 's political content caused several senior staff to walk , including renown cartoonist @entity91			1
@entity60 convinced @entity5 to leave with him , and together the pair revived @entity6 , which was originally founded in 1970 , but went out of print in 1981			1
@entity60 was one of the nine staff killed alongside @entity5 when bloodthirsty jihadis said and @entity97 bust into their offices last wednesday and opened fire			2
operating now without restrictions , @entity5 and @entity60 quickly established a reputation for pushing the boundaries of taste , while staunchly defending the right to freedom of expression			2
@entity5 was at the centre of the 2006 decision to reprint cartoons of @entity11 by @entity111 illustrator @entity110 which caused international outrage			2
emotional : clutching a drink in one hand and a friend in the other , @entity114 weeps as @entity5 's casket is carried away from his funeral service in @entity8 defiant : the raised fist gesture was a fitting send off for a man who lived his life in opposition , and once declared ' i would rather die standing than live on my knees ' sombre : pallbearers take the coffin of @entity129 into the community centre in @entity30 , @entity8 , at his funeral service earlier today after @entity132 , another former @entity86 contributor , left the magazine in 2009 it was @entity5 who stepped in to take his place			1
ensuring the publication remained as controversial as ever , he put together an issue in which the magazine was renamed ' @entity139 ' , which claimed to be guest edited by @entity11 , and carried the cover slogan ' 100 lashes if you do n't die laughing '			0
that lead to the magazine 's offices being firebombed in 2011 , though at the time of that attack they were empty			0
the target was instead believed to be the publication 's computer system			0
@entity5 was placed under police guard after death threats flooded in , and @entity6 relocated to its new premises on @entity156 , where the attacks took place last week			2
a mourner wearing a t - shirt bearing the @entity162 slogan , a defiant rallying cry that spread around the world in the days after the @entity8 attacks , arrives to pay his respects respect : a band play their instruments as @entity5 's coffin is taken away from the service to be buried packed : mourners unable to find a space inside the community centre watch tributes being paid to @entity5 on large tv screens outside refusing to bow to the threats , he published several subsequent editions featuring @entity11 including him being pushed around by a rabbi while in a wheelchair - which he drew himself			1
his defiant stance lead to several fatwas being issued against him , and in 2013 he was placed on @entity183 's hit - list of nine men wanted ' for crimes against @entity186 '			0
he died last week aged 47 during the massacre at the magazine 's office			0
witness reports said he was the main target of the attack , and his name was called before he was shot			0
he was murdered alongside @entity60 , 76 , @entity194 , 54 , @entity195 , 74 , @entity196 , 68 , @entity197 , 60 , @entity198 , 69 , @entity199 , 57 , and @entity200 , 80			0
several hundred people attended his emotional funeral service in @entity30 today , the day after services took place for @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity205 , and @entity206 , the police protection officer assigned to look after @entity5			1
@entity207 was also in @entity8 today to pay his respects , and visited the @entity6 offices where tributes to those killed , including @entity5 , have been attached to the walls			1
