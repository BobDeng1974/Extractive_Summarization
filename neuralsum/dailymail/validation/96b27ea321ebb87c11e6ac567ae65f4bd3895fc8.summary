it is a secretive nation that is not known for its open and transparent nature			2
but @entity3 photographer @entity2 was among the first visitors to be allowed to visit the @entity6 fishing village of @entity7 - a model community so remote it is not located on any maps			1
the rural outpost is part of a project to create homestays for tourists , allowing them a glimpse of life in @entity6 , albeit a very sanitised version of reality			1
photographer @entity2 experienced life in the beautiful @entity6 fishing village of @entity7 , which is opening the doors for tourists to witness rural life he stayed in a well - kept homestay , home of the chief of the village			1
there are only 23 families in the area , which is so remote it is not located on a map the decor inside included an assortment of plush toys , plants , coloured mats and photographs of the country 's leaders the village is open for homestays and is a far cry from the poverty surrounding it , with its air conditioned facilities and houses equipped with three televisions			1
described by @entity2 as an @entity53 - style local property that tourists can visit , he also admits the conditions of a stay can be somewhat restrictive			1
@entity2 explains that the fleeting view from the bus windows is very different to what he finds at the homestay			1
he explains : ' the roads on the east coast are very muddy and filled with potholes that workers have tried their best to fix			0
' i see an electric fence lining the beach as an attempt to stall possible @entity71 invasion			0
' the poverty in these rural villages is palpable			2
from the comfy seat in my bus , i see old , dilapidated houses with roofs ready to collapse			0
' only huge murals of the smiling @entity79 bring color to these bleak landscapes			0
my guide informs me that most tourists do not journey this far into the countryside , and that i may be the first @entity87 to ever visit this area			1
' however , the journey to the village and views from the house windows reveal traces of the surrounding hardship experienced by locals			2
' it 's a good opportunity to show tourists a flattering image of rural life , the fragile pillar of the country 's economy , ' @entity2 said			1
' the beautiful portrayal of rural life provides the @entity6 government a flattering image to capitilise on			1
' the photographer travelled to the @entity106 , situated in the @entity107 , wary of what he would discover			2
' only 23 families resided here			0
immediately , i fear i 'm in a @entity6 tourist trap , complete with actors portraying reality			1
' @entity2 stayed with the village @entity116 , in a well - kept house , which , although it came complete with ensuite bathrooms , had a bed consisting of a futon on the floor			1
each house in the village is identical			0
@entity2 describes the decor as ' kitschy ' , with huge plush toys , plastic flowers , large plant pots being watched by the propaganda portraits lining the walls			1
and the village is still reeling from a visit 11 years ago by @entity132 , when the community was first unveiled as a model village			2
the house @entity136 entered was a two - storey building with the best view of the local sandy beach , and his visit is immortalised by a plaque above the door documenting the occasion			0
his visit still brings sobs to the homeowner , and she emotionally relayed the encounter to @entity147 , explaining : ' i did not know general @entity132 would come			0
it was a great surprise for me			0
' the neighbors were so jealous			0
as we took a picture together , which i will forever treasure , he told me the house was nice			0
this made me so happy , ' she said			0

the water is heated by placing an antique electrical warmer in it @entity2 was treated to a sumptuous meal of duck for dinner , although he learned that the village members sometimes go hungry during the winter months			1
@entity180 are banned from visiting , but the @entity3 photographer asked if any @entity180 arriving would be welcomed to the homestay			1
the smart response was : ' @entity180 are our enemies , but i would welcome them in the name of legendary @entity6 hospitality			2
' despite the built - up houses , when asked about cell phones , his question was met with confusion , and electricity only runs until 9pm daily			0
the village members require a permit to travel within their country , and they are kept as treasured possessions when granted			0

' @entity2 gathered that the area had received government funding and support to become as developed as it is today			1
despite being impressed by the homestay , and the stunning beaches and landscapes in the fishing village , @entity2 could not help but notice the poverty of the surroundings creeping in when they thought he was n't looking			1
' the guides wanted to hide from me the reality of this life , but from my bedroom window , i can see emaciated oxes with carts full of wood and women carrying heavy loads			2
i also see some girls picking flowers for a bouquet , and others picking grass in @entity271 bags to eat for lunch			0
' the photographer has been banned for his work depicting the realities of life in @entity6 , and had to smuggle photographs out of the country on memory cards , after his camera was confiscated			1

this made me so happy , ' she said soldiers walk along the sandy beaches of the fishing village which is in @entity106 , situated in the @entity107 @entity6 agriculture works under quite difficult conditions , most of @entity6 's territory is occupied by mountains and is thus not arable , the little land that is left faces many problems			1
