@entity0 admitted afterwards that this was a game @entity3 had to win to maintain their improbable title dream			1
but the luck they had been enjoying over six successive victories ran out			2
this was another incomplete performance characterised by pedestrian build - up play			2
@entity3 controlled possession and had a significant territorial advantage			1
but aside from a period at the start of the second half , they never exerted the craft or drive needed to break down the @entity19 defence			1
@entity20 was back to his best and @entity21 and @entity22 impressed — even when @entity19 were inexplicably reduced to 10 men with @entity25 ’s red card 25 minutes from time			1
@entity3 ’s clinical finishing has outweighed brittle defending of late , but neither were evident here			1
despite the presence of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , sparks failed to fly			2
@entity31 fails to connect with an opportunity to give @entity3 the lead against @entity19 @entity35 opened the scoring on a day that @entity3 boss @entity0 said was ' two points dropped ' @entity35 's shot was too good for @entity3 goalkeeper @entity39 who was left rooted to the spot @entity3 playmaker @entity41 ( right ) is tackled by @entity19 captain @entity20 during the @entity43 encounter given the ground @entity3 have to make up on @entity45 , a draw away to @entity19 is , as @entity47 admitted , ‘ two points dropped ’ even after falling behind to @entity35 ’s opening goal of real quality			1
@entity50 is the most decisive referee in the select group with straight red cards , but sometimes he sees ones which are not there			2
when @entity25 went into a strong challenge with @entity57 it was hard to see who made the foul			0
both were committed and the @entity19 man ’s momentum meant he caught @entity57 on the follow - through			1
@entity50 would not have been influenced by @entity3 ’s players surrounding him and he had already decided			1
i hope the card is rescinded on appeal			0
@entity30 scored with a powerful header on his return to the side but his overall influence must improve			0
for long periods the @entity73 struggled to impose himself			0
@entity32 , who had a good game , vocalised @entity3 ’s disappointment			1
‘ we were pushing them and we had good possession but just could n’t get a breakthrough , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re paying the price for that now			0
we should have got three points , so we ’re a bit disappointed and frustrated			2
’ from a player who had previously talked up @entity3 ’s title challenge , the overall sentiment was clear			1
@entity90 ’s deployment in a three - man defence may have run its course			2
@entity93 played in midfield due to the injury and illness of @entity96 and @entity97 respectively			0
@entity3 substitute @entity98 ( left ) battles for the ball against impressive @entity19 defender @entity22 but the @entity101 could not provide the creative thrust of @entity90 , who switched to midfield at half time as @entity105 replaced @entity93			1
@entity47 explained : ‘ we kept the ball much better but we did n’t create so much because we were not looking to the forwards			1
that ’s why i changed @entity93 with @entity90 at half time , because i know he ’s more a of a passer to the forwards			0
‘ but it was not good enough to get the victory here			0
we were not creative enough in the second half ; we did n’t keep the ball as well as in the first half but we had more aggression			2
so that was the plus , i think			0
@entity30 scored the equaliser with a header from an @entity57 cross just before the hour mark @entity30 slides on his knees in front of the travelling @entity3 supporters as he celebrates his strike ‘ okay , we have a draw and that ’s why i ’m a little frustrated because we could have won this game , we did n’t and we are responsible			1
’ asked if @entity3 could win the title , @entity47 said : ‘ no , because you have seen that you have to win these matches and we did n’t win			1
but there is still a long time to go			0
‘ when you want to be a part of the title race you have to win these games			0
’ @entity90 predicted that @entity30 is set to start showing his worth			0
‘ he ’s scored so many goals over the years and you always feels when he gets that chance he will score			0
after being out for a bit that ’s him back and hopefully he can go on a bit of a streak for us			0
’ @entity21 ( left ) had a good day for @entity19 and managed to keep the likes of @entity32 from scoring			2

@entity3 's draw at @entity19 ended a run of six straight wins
@entity3 manager @entity0 described the draw as ' two points dropped '
@entity47 also said that his men were ' not creative enough ' against @entity19
