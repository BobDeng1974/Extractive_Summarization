a bereft mother says she is outraged that a bungling doctor who sent her sick toddler home from hospital three days before he died of dehydration and kidney failure is allowed to carry on working			1
@entity7 , 19 months , was admitted to hospital in april 2011 with sickness , diarrhoea and lethargy			1
but , despite his mother @entity14 's concerns about her son 's condition , paediatrician dr @entity12 told mrs @entity17 , 32 , she should take her son home			1
three days later , his devastated father @entity20 , 47 , found the youngster lifeless in his cot			2
furious : @entity24 , 47 , and his wife @entity14 , 32 , from @entity25 , are outraged that the doctor who sent home their sick toddler from hospital three days before he died has been allowed to carry on working tragic : @entity7 , 19 months , was found dead in his cot by his father three days after being sent home from @entity32			1
he died of dehydration and kidney failure , caused by an inflamed colon yesterday , a tribunal brought by the @entity37 found dr @entity38 guilty of a series of failings , including failing to carry out vital checks before discharging @entity7			1
but , despite objections from the @entity37 , the tribunal ruled that dr @entity38 was still fit to practise , after clearing her of other charges			1
they also refused a plea from the @entity37 to put a warning on dr @entity38 's file			1
mrs @entity17 , from @entity49 , @entity25 , today branded dr @entity38 a ' danger to other patients ' and accused the @entity52 of ' failing to protect the public '			1
she told @entity54 : ' i believe @entity7 would still be alive if the doctor had listened to me			2
i feel it is nothing short of criminal			0
the worst part is that these errors , which the hearing found had taken place , killed my son			0
' at an inquest that heard evidence from several practitioners involved in @entity7 's care , coroner @entity65 catalogued a series of ‘ failings ’ by staff at the hospital and a gp ’s out - of - hours service			1
mrs @entity65 said that , had @entity7 remained in hospital or been readmitted with a robust care plan , his chances of survival would have been ' enhanced '			2
but she said she did not feel there had been a ' gross failure ' to provide basic medical attention			0
recording a narrative verdict , she said : ' windows of opportunity to treat @entity7 were lost			0
these were on the first occasion he was discharged from @entity32 , the second time when he was only seen for a few hours and when he was seen at an out - of - hours service			0
' had @entity7 remained in hospital or been readmitted with a robust care plan , his chances of survival would have been enhanced			2
' the tribunal heard dr @entity38 should have taken more care in assessing @entity7 after he was readmitted to hospital an investigation by the hospital also found that key procedures had not been carried out			1
after the inquest , the trust apologised to the @entity17 family ' for the failings identified by the coroner in the care of their son '			2
but although mrs @entity17 accepted the hospital 's apology , she said she is furious about the tribunal 's decision			1
' go and get me 100,000 people off the street , tell them @entity7 's story and ask if they would be happy for this doctor to treat their child , ' she said			1
the tribunal said dr @entity12 's ( pictured ) fitness to practise was not impaired because it did not amount to misconduct ' i am furious , i ca n't explain how angry i am			1
to let her walk away without even a warning is just criminal			0
@entity127 help any child that comes into her care			0
' dr @entity38 faced a fitness to practise hearing in @entity133 , accused of allowing her care of @entity7 to fall ‘ seriously below ’ what was expected			1
at the hearing , dr @entity38 , who was then a fourth - year specialist trainee paediatric registrar , admitted failing to record the frequency , quantity and volume of @entity7 ’s passage of stool and vomit and to then seek further clarification over these issues			1
the medic also confessed to not comparing his current weight to his weight when he was previously discharged			0
but she denied a number of other accusations , including that she had failed to adequately assess @entity7 's symptoms			1
the hearing had heard how @entity7 fell ill at his home on april 23 , 2011 and was referred to @entity32 by the family gp three days later			2
he was then examined by paediatrician dr @entity155 , who said he was not dehydrated , but recommended that he be given @entity156 , a rehydration treatment to boost salt and sugar levels			2
the following morning , he was discharged by dr @entity160 , who said the parents could have a ‘ 48 - hour open access ’ to the ward , meaning he would not need a referral to be seen again , the hearing was told			0
then , at around 3.30pm on 28 april , @entity7 was brought back to hospital by his mother after his parents felt his condition had deteriorated			2
it was the decisions made on this visit which were the subject of the hearing			0
the @entity37 had said that dr @entity38 should have exercised ' a greater degree of caution when deciding the appropriate course of action ' towards @entity7 and when discharging him			1
they argued that the standard of care provided by @entity38 ' fell seriously below that expected of a registrar '			0
mrs @entity17 said : ' @entity7 had diarrhoea and had slept around the clock for days , which was so strange because he never slept			1
it got to the point where he could barely hold his own head up			0
' when we saw dr @entity38 , my words to her were : " he 's got really bad diarrhoea , he can not sustain this , or he is going to become dehydrated "			1
but she said she was absolutely sure he was n't dehydrated			0
' the panel heard that dr @entity38 did not think @entity7 was dehydrated before she discharged him at around 5.45pm on the afternoon of 28 april			1
but the next day @entity7 ’s condition had deteriorated again , to such an extent that his parents described him as ‘ lifeless ’			0
grandmother @entity198 rang the hospital , but was told by a nurse they should take the toddler to their gp or accident and emergency , the tribunal was told			0
after phoning the @entity202 out - of - hours service , the family spoke to dr @entity207 who said they should bring him in to the out - of - hours service as he may be suffering from dehydration			0
at the out - of - hours service , @entity7 was examined by dr @entity211 who assessed that he was not dehydrated and did not need to be readmitted			2
@entity7 was twice admitted to @entity32 ( pictured ) but was discharged both times as he continued to be unwell , @entity213 and mrs @entity17 moved @entity7 's cot into their bedroom			1
but in the early hours of may 1 , 2011 , when mr @entity7 got up to check on his son , he found his son had died			2
the hearing began in august but was adjourned , before being concluded this week			0
it was found that dr @entity38 had failed to adequately assess or record whether @entity7 was ‘ well hydrated ’ or ‘ not well hydrated ' and also failed to record that @entity7 was lethargic when taking his history			1
she was also found guilty of failing to arrange for a longer period of observation and assessment of @entity7 ’s hydration status but she was cleared of failing to record the right clinical procedures when assessing @entity7 's hydration , including abnormalities in his respiratory rate and pulse rate			1
she was also cleared of failing to arrange for the duty consultant to review @entity7 's status and carrying out blood tests requested by the duty consultant			1
despite the ' multiple failings ' proved against her , the panel found that dr @entity38 's fitness to practise was not impaired because her behaviour did not constitute misconduct			1
the @entity37 then asked for a warning to be put on her registration , which was also refused , meaning dr @entity38 is free to carry on working unrestricted			1
the panel said dr @entity38 had demonstrated ' genuine insight ' into the level of failings and also believed the incident was isolated ' in an otherwise unblemished career '			1
it added there were no indicators to suggest the doctor 's failings would be repeated			0
last year the tribunal heard she was working on the children 's oncology unit at a hospital in @entity263			2
mrs @entity17 said : ' it was not just her decisions that led to my son 's death - it was a catalogue of errors			2
but dr @entity38 made some really significant decisions			2
' if she was a doctor that had slept with a patient , then she would have been struck off yesterday			0
i 'm not saying doctors should go around sleeping with patients , but what is more serious : that , or a child needlessly dying ? ' she added : ' it does not matter if it was an isolated incident			0
if i knocked someone over in my car tomorrow , i would probably be jailed for it , even if i did n't mean to do it			0
' mrs @entity17 said she is determined to keep fighting and has been talking to a company about a private prosecution			0
she said : ' i ca n't change what happened			0
but i can ensure it does not happen needlessly again			0
if i do n't keep fighting , i 'm sure it will happen again - my heart says it will			0
' if there is an avenue to go down , we will go down it			0
i am not a @entity298 basher , they do a great job and there are far more good doctors than bad			0
but , when the bad ones do something wrong , why do we let them get away with it ? why ca n't we just say when they get it wrong ? '			0
