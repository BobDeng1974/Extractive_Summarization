the former frontbencher said she was ‘ baffled ’ and ‘ startled ’ by the jury ’s ruling that mr @entity14 ’s killing was lawful			1
but she faced criticism for appearing to second guess the jury , which spent months examining the evidence of what happened in the moments before the police shot mr @entity14 dead in august 2011			1
police marksman were criticised for their accounts of the incident which differed from members of the public			0
equipping officers with video cameras would help cut out ' opinions and conjecture ' similar to those that have plagued the @entity14 investigation			2
the central question raised by the disputed evidence was whether @entity14 , a known drug dealer and member of the notorious @entity51 , was armed as he emerged from a taxi before being shot			1
@entity54 assistant commissioner @entity53 said : ' is it possible to rule out a situation where it turns out the person was n't holding a lethal weapon ? no it 's not			2
' he explained that that issues from imitation firearms to poor lighting mean mistakes are inevitable			0
he said : ' you ca n't avoid that , but the officer by law has to justify that they reasonably believed that there was such imminent risk of lethal force being used against them or some other person that they had no choice but to pull the trigger			0
it 's a very high bar			2
' the killing of the 29 - year - old gangster in @entity27 , north @entity28 , in august 2011 sparked the outbreak of rioting and looting across the country			1
amid fears of a fresh outbreak of violence following the inquest , riot police have been put on standby across the capital			1
the father - of - six 's aunt @entity94 defiantly raised her fist outside court yesterday and vowed ' no justice , no peace ' and said that police had ' executed ' her nephew			1
but in an about turn this morning , she called for ' no more violence ' and said they would seek justice through the courts - rather than on the streets			1
however , the family plan to hold a vigil in @entity27 at the weekend and there are concerns that the event could spark unrest in a repeat of what happened immediately after he was killed in 2011			1
today @entity114 appealed for a calm response to the verdict that mr @entity14 was lawfully killed by a police marksman despite being unarmed			1
the prime minister said he hoped people would respect the ' proper judicial process '			1
speaking to @entity121 , he said : ' i very much respect @entity9 's aunt for saying they want to pursue their case through the courts rather than on the streets , i think that 's absolutely right			1
' these issues raise very strong emotions but i hope people can react calmly and recognise that we have proper judicial processes in this country and they are the ones that must be followed and respected			1
' tensions : police talk to members of the public on @entity140 today amid fears of fresh violence following the @entity9 inquest verdict police presence : officers patrol in @entity27 today as riot police are put on standby amid fears of fresh rioting in the capital a policeman wearing @entity152 body camera with his uniform - similar to those that could be worn by armed officers miss @entity4 , who was in @entity157 ’s frontbench team until last october , sparked controversy when she tweeted after the inquest : ‘ if the @entity14 jury believe that he did not have a gun in his hand when he was shot , how can they find it was a lawful killing ? ’ she later said there would be ‘ questions to be asked ’			1
@entity168 mp @entity167 condemned the remarks : ‘ we have a system of courts in this country			2
i do n’t think it ’s appropriate for people to second guess the verdict of a court that has followed due process			1
‘ given the events of the summer of 2011 community leaders and politicians need to be very careful of their language and not say things that inflame matters			2
’ miss @entity4 was repeatedly challenged live on air today about whether an elected politician should appear to question the outcome of a @entity189 court			0
she accused @entity191 presenter @entity190 of not doing their viewers a ‘ service ’ by focusing on her comments instead of the wider issues the case raised			0
under pressure , she said : ‘ i am not second guessing the jury today but i was taken aback but that ’s different from saying i am in some way trying to challenge the jury			0
‘ but what i am challenging is you harping on about this issue rather than the issues facing the area of @entity27			2
’ shooting : paramedics work on @entity9 in the moments after he was fatally shot by a @entity54 marksman in @entity27 , north @entity28 , in august 2011 @entity213 : @entity214 - seen here declaring ' no justice , no peace ' - today vowed there should be ' no more violence ' after a jury ruled @entity9 had been lawfully killed @entity220 said there are ' questions to be asked ' about how investigations into police shootings are handled after an inquest found @entity9 was lawfully killed despite being unarmed			1

he said he is ' open to ideas and advice '			0
speaking on his weekly @entity247 phone - in , mr @entity220 said : ' i can totally understand and i think the commissioner is quite right to say this morning that he also understands why that has caused as much anxiety , concern , in some cases outright anger among members of the community , his family and friends			1
' i am sure there are questions that need to be asked , not only about how some of these investigations are conducted			0
' the @entity262 leader went on : ' at the end of the day in this case , this is a jury			0
this is a jury just like a court jury			0
' mr @entity220 backed a move to equip all armed police with cameras so such events are recorded			0
he added : ' this is really , really difficult , it is a very , very difficult time			0
it is a time of great anxiety in @entity27			2
@entity276 , @entity5 mp for @entity27 said parts of the verdict were ‘ perplexing and seemingly contradictory ’			1
but he added : ‘ this was a ten - person jury that heard over three months of evidence , testimonies and expert accounts and took seven days to reach a decision			0
