by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 says the rivalry between @entity4 and @entity5 will be as intense as ever when they meet in the final of the @entity8 on monday - even if it is still pre-season			1
the @entity10 has played more minutes on @entity4 's tour of the @entity12 than any of his team - mates and is likely to feature again when the old foes meet in @entity15			1
after three years of pain and frustration as he battled ulcerative colitis , the 270 minutes @entity2 has played on the tour finally proves he is on the road to recovery			1
' it ’s @entity4 vs @entity5			1
it does n't matter if it ’s pre-season			1
we want to win , ' he said			2
@entity2 captained @entity4 to their fourth and most impressive pre-season win on saturday when they defeated @entity39 3 - 1 at @entity52 in front of 109,318 spectators			1
with all the focus being on @entity35 , the story of @entity2 ’s return to the first - team has flown under the radar over the last fortnight			1
in 2011 @entity2 was diagnosed with the chronic bowel disease			1
the debilitating illness left @entity2 ' running to the toilet 10 , 20 , 30 times a day , ' he explained recently			1
old friends : @entity2 and @entity66 catch up with former team - mate @entity67 after @entity4 beat @entity39 3 - 1 to secure their place in the final of the @entity8 in form : @entity71 ( second left ) celebrates one of his two goals as @entity4 beat @entity39 3 - 1 in front of a record crowd of over 109,000 at the @entity52 as a result , @entity2 has spent nearly two of the last three years on the sidelines			1
it is no surprise , therefore , that he is happy to be back to full fitness			2
' i do n’t want to look back , but everyone knows i 've been through a lot , ' @entity2 said			1
' i have not had a pre-season for three years			2
' but now i am back in the gym and i am feeling the benefits from that			0
' i am getting stronger and hopefully i can get as fit as possible			0
' i am looking forward to the new season			0
' dark days : @entity2 leaves the field after @entity4 crashed out of the @entity92 against @entity93 last season hot pursuit : @entity2 chases after @entity97 's @entity96 in the @entity99 encounter last year for a man who has dedicated the last 19 years of his life to @entity4 , last season ’s seventh - place under @entity104 was hard to take			1
the midfielder and his team - mates want to prove that was nothing but a blip			0
' @entity5 , @entity110 and @entity111 all finished above us last year so it was disappointing for us , ' he said			2
' next season we all want to show what we are capable of			0
' we have got a fantastic team spirit			0
we were talking about it the other night among ourselves			0
' we are all pulling in the right direction and we all want the best for @entity4			2
' we realise some experienced players have gone and it ’s up to us to come together and get us back up there			0
' @entity121 sealed : @entity122 celebrates with @entity123 after scoring @entity4 's third goal against @entity39 it may just be pre-season , but the fact that three of @entity4 ’s four wins on tour have come against some of @entity132 ’s top clubs has given the squad optimism about the season ahead			1
@entity135 must take credit for installing that confidence among the playing staff			0
the contrast between the atmosphere in the camp and the final weeks of @entity104 ’ reign could not be greater			2
the players are happy to undertake double training sessions under their new manager and they have adapted well to @entity135 ’s 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 formation			0
the players are smiling again			0
and so is the manager , who was happy to chat and pose for photographs with fans after the match in @entity151 on saturday			0
' we are just enjoying it , ' @entity2 said when asked about the difference between this season and the last			2
confident mood : @entity4 look a different proposition under new manager @entity35 in form : @entity5 have also impressed in the pre-season tournament , beating @entity110 , @entity160 and @entity161 to reach the final against @entity4 @entity163 no concern - @entity164 ' the manager expects a lot from us and he thinks we have got the ability to do it			1
' he demands a lot , but the players have responded			0
' we are enjoying playing in a new system and under him			0
' just like @entity4 , @entity5 have experienced a summer of upheaval , with star striker @entity174 departing for @entity175			1
the @entity176 have registered wins over @entity110 , @entity160 and @entity161 while in the @entity12 though so they will be confident of taking home the one million @entity12 dollar prize ( £ 600,000 ) too			0
@entity5 will be without @entity180 as he has been sent home for treatment on a hamstring injury which kept him out of saturday ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity160			1
' @entity185 has flown back to the @entity186 , ' @entity5 boss @entity164 said			2
' he had a really , really slight feeling in his hamstring			0

@entity4 and @entity5 contest final of @entity8 in @entity15 on monday
' it does n't matter if it 's pre-season , we want to win , ' said @entity2
@entity10 has played more minutes on @entity4 's pre-season tour than anyone else in the squad
