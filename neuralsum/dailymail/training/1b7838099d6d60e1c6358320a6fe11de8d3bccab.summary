as if the plight of double amputee @entity11 were n’t enough to make a thief twice , the @entity9 man was about to use his bike to help someone else in need			2
‘ i 'm raising money for a prosthetic for a little boy , ’ @entity11 told @entity18 ’s @entity17 as he fought back tears			1
stolen : double amputee @entity11 , seen here riding the custom cycle , recently awoke to find his bike had been stolen @entity11 , who lost his arms in a work accident , planned to start a charity ride june 8 — to stretch from @entity18 to @entity28 , @entity29 — called @entity30			1
however , crooks put those plans on hold when they broke into @entity11 ’s van and made off with his specially designed bike			2
‘ they were able to pull the bike that was strapped inside the car out through the back and dump stuff on the floor right over my prosthetic arms , ’ @entity11 said			1
sad : @entity11 was preparing for a cross-country charity ride to buy @entity43 , pictured , prosthetic arms obvious : the bike was stolen from the @entity9 man 's van , which is covered in uplifting messages about his condition and the prosthetics likely were n’t the crook ’s first tip - off that they were n’t stealing just any bike			1
a picture of the amputee riding his bike is emblazoned across the van , along with the uplifting messages like , ‘ no hands , no problem , no excuses			0
’ now @entity11 has made an appeal , hoping the thief will have the compassion to return the bike			0
he said he ’s willing not to ask any questions if the bike is quietly returned			0
hurtful : the crooks stole the bike from right beside @entity11 's prosthetic arms and if it is n’t ? @entity11 said he ’ll find a way to keep his promise to @entity43 , anyway			1
‘ i 'm not going to let these jerks stop me , ’ said a defiant @entity11			1
‘ i 'll still do it			0
’ ' if i have to use my old bike , i 'll struggle a little more			0
but i 'm going to get it done anyway			0
' @entity11 lost his arms in 1992 at the age of 24			2
he has since become a motivation speaker and runs a website , where you can read about and give to his causes , here			0
conviction : ' i 'm not going to let these jerks stop me , ' @entity11 said and plans to make his ride frm @entity18 to @entity28 no matter what			1
