a family that has worked the same hillside farm for five generations was yesterday forced to hand over their land to an ‘ aggressive ’ loan company			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , who produce beef and lamb for supermarkets , say their lives have been destroyed after they were tied to crippling interest rates that dragged them into millions of pounds of debt			1
@entity17 yesterday ruled they would have to hand over the 600 - acre @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , which the family has farmed for a century			1
@entity7 and @entity8 ( pictured ) , who produce beef and lamb for supermarkets at their 600 - acre farm in @entity19 , @entity20 , have ordered by a court to hand over their land to a loan company @entity28 , 55 , ( pictured outside @entity29 following the ruling ) said it was ' the worst day of our lives ' and claimed the couple had been ' duped by a firm that is asset - stripping farmers of their livelihoods ' last night mrs @entity28 , 55 , said : ‘ it has been absolutely heartbreaking , the worst day of our lives			1
we have been totally duped by a firm that is asset - stripping farmers of their livelihoods			2
‘ my family and especially my sons , @entity45 and @entity46 , who farm the land , face an uncertain future			2
i think the fact nothing has been done to stop this company is a national disgrace			0
‘ i ca n’t believed we were so stupid as to believe them and trust them			0
’ the @entity28 family say they were advised about four years ago to take a short - term commercial bridging loan to cover their mortgage – starting at rates of up to 22 per cent with the understanding a domestic mortgage rate of around 4 per cent would follow			1
as it did not materialise they took out further bridging loans and saw their £ 1.24million loan rocket to £ 3.1million due to fees , interest and other charges			1
when they were unable to pay , the firm – @entity71 - based @entity70 @entity69 – started legal action to repossess the farm			2
farmers across the @entity70 are being driven to the wall by lenders using lax regulation to seize properties and livelihoods , say mps , who accused @entity81 of ‘ reckless , if not fraudulent ’ practice			0
the couple initially took out a short - term commercial bridging loan to cover their mortgage four years ago but saw the amount they had to pay back soar to £ 3.1million due to additional loans , fees , interest and charges the family has farmed on the 600 - acre estate in @entity20 for the last century			1
pictured : three generations of @entity28 in 1995 : @entity45 , the son of @entity8 ( left ) , with his father @entity8 ( centre ) , who is the son @entity45 ( right ) dismissing mrs @entity28 ’ application for permission to appeal against the forfeiture of the farm , mr justice @entity97 said : ‘ i have n’t been persuaded an appeal would have a real prospect of success			1
' i appreciate the thoroughly unenviable position mrs @entity28 and her family find themselves and i very much sympathise with them			2
’ as commercial lending is unregulated , most of @entity81 ’s activities are not overseen by the @entity113			0
@entity114 , a @entity116 mp and barrister , said @entity81 and associated companies had exploited farmers for more than two decades in what he called ‘ one of the worst scandals ’ he had seen			0
dozens of farmers have complained to @entity126 , saying they were victims of an organised sting with conspiring lenders , brokers and solicitors			0
mrs @entity28 ( pictured right on the farm in 2007 ) said : ' i ca n’t believed we were so stupid as to believe and trust them ' after being dragged into debt by the loans			2
pictured left : her husband @entity8 working on the farm in 1986 the couple said their lives have been destroyed by the crippling interest rates that dragged them into debt in response to complaints it had not tackled @entity81 , the force said it accepted the lender was ‘ aggressive and unpleasant ’ and had caused significant distress			1
it said the firm exploits a ‘ loophole ’ and called for tighter regulation			0
now the @entity113 , the @entity155 and the government are scrutinising @entity81 ’s activities			0
outside court , the firm said : ‘ @entity70 @entity69 has repeatedly invited mrs @entity28 to enter into a constructive dialogue with it to achieve the repayment of her loans but mrs @entity28 has chosen not to take up those invitations			0
' that has left @entity70 @entity69 with no option other than the enforcement of its loan security			0
