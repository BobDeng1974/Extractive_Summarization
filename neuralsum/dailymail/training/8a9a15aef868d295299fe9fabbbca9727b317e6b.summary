something strange is happening on comet @entity1 as space engineers prepare for a historic landing : the icy space rock is ' singing '			1
the mysterious sound has baffled scientists , who recorded it using a @entity11 instrument originally designed to analyse the comet 's magnetic field			1
instead , this instrument picked up a strange bubbling sound which scientists believe was created by a stream of electrically - charged particles			1
' we did not expect this and we are still working to understand the physics of what is happening			0
' the comet is ' singing ' at 40 - 50 millihertz , but the human ear only picks up sound between 20 hz and 20 khz			0
because the original audio is below the threshold of human hearing , professor @entity27 has created a recording with the pitch magnified a thousand times			0
click below to play the audio @entity11 will release @entity42 at 08:35 gmt / 09:35 cet on 12 november at a distance			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of the lander on @entity48 @entity11 will release @entity42 at 08:35 gmt / 09:35 cet on 12 november at a distance of 14 miles ( 22.5km ) from the centre of the comet			1
the landing will be about seven hours later at around 15:30 gmt / 16:30 cet			0
during the descent , @entity42 will take images and conduct science experiments , sampling the dust , gas and plasma environment close to the comet			2
it will take a ' farewell ' image of the @entity11 orbiter shortly after separation , along with a number of images as it approaches the comet surface			0
it is expected that the first images from this sequence will be received on @entity70 several hours after separation			0
once safely on the surface , @entity42 will take a panorama of its surroundings			0
again , this is expected back on @entity70 several hours later			2
the first sequence of surface science experiments will begin about an hour after touchdown and will last for 64 hours , constrained by the lander 's primary battery lifetime			0
longer - term study of the comet by @entity42 will depend on for how long and how well the batteries are able to recharge , which is related to the amount of dust that settles on its solar panels			1
it is expected that by march 2015 , as the comet moves closer in its orbit towards the sun , temperatures inside the lander will have reached levels too high to continue operations , and @entity42 's science mission will come to an end			1
but the @entity11 orbiter 's mission will continue for much longer			0
it will accompany the comet as it grows in activity until their closest approach to the sun in august 2015 and then as they head back towards the outer solar system			1
the music was heard clearly by the magnetometer experiment for the first time in august , when @entity11 drew to within 60 miles ( 100 km ) of @entity48			0
scientists think it must be produced in some way by the activity of the comet , as it releases neutral particles into space where they become electrically charged due to a process called ionisation			1
while the precise physical process behind the oscillations remains a mystery , flight engineers hope it might prove useful in guiding the descent of the @entity42 lander tomorrow morning			1
this is the first time in history that anyone has attempted to land on a comet , and scientists hope the data will help them unravel how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago			1
tomorrow morning , tensions at @entity135 ( pictured ) in @entity136 will be running high as space engineers attempt to land @entity42 onto the surface of comet @entity139 – @entity140 the comet is named after astronomers @entity143 and @entity140 who identified it in 1969			1
it is believed to originate from the @entity146 , a large reservoir of small icy bodies located just beyond @entity149			0
scientists describe it as a ' @entity154 class ' comet which takes 6.45 years to complete one full circuit of the sun the icy core , or nucleus , is about 2.4 miles ( 4km ) across and the comet takes around 12.4 hours to rotate fully			2
the comet has now been observed from @entity70 on seven approaches to the @entity162 : in 1969 , 1976 , 1982 , 1989 , 1996 , 2002 and 2009			2
over an entire year , as it approaches the sun , @entity11 will orbit the comet , mapping its surface and studying changes in its activity			0
as its ices evaporate , instruments on board the orbiter will study the dust and gas particles that surround the comet and trail behind it the comet is currently 300 million miles away ( 480 million km ) , and is travelling through space at about 34,000 mph ( 55,000 km / h )			0
@entity11 has chased @entity139 – @entity140 through space for more than ten years in what has been described as ' the sexiest , most fantastic mission ever '			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles ( 30 km ) away from @entity48			2
when it was launched in 2004 , @entity11 was so far from @entity186 that it had to pass @entity70 three times and @entity189 once , so that it could use the planets ' gravity to slingshot its way deep into the solar system			1
at 08.35 gmt tomorrow , mission control in @entity136 , @entity136 will send a command to release the @entity42 probe from @entity11 's grip			1
the probe will then be in free fall for seven hours , before landing on the icy surface of comet @entity139 – @entity140			0
if all goes to plan , @entity42 should send a signal back to mission control engineers at around 4pm gmt. the @entity42 probe aims to analyse the comet in more detail than @entity11 could			1
the results , @entity205 claims , could completely rewrite the history of how the @entity70 formed			2
the daring descent @entity42 ( artist 's impression shown ) will take seven hours from separation			2
it will be exactly nine years that a similar landing attempt on an asteroid by @entity215 's @entity214 failed in 2005			0

@entity217 recorded on instrument designed to analyse @entity48 's magnetic field
scientists believe it was created by a stream of charged particles
however , the precise physical process behind sound remains a mystery
engineers hope it will prove useful in guiding the @entity42 landing tomorrow
if all goes to plan , @entity42 will send a signal back to @entity70 at 4pm gmt
comet data could *reveal* how solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago
