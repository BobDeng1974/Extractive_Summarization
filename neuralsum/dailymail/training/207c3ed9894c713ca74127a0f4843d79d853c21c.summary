' in one view , it is a " public trust " and not a business			0
it is something greater than a commercial enterprise , ineffable , an ideal that can not be touched			0
financially , it would be a charity [ ... ] at the @entity1 , i believe we owe it to ourselves and to this institution to aim to become a sustainable business and not position ourselves to rely on the largesse of an unpredictable few			2

the letter said ' @entity1 can not be merely a " brand			2
" it has never been and can not be a " media company " that markets " content			0
" its essays , criticism , reportage , and poetry are not " product			0
" it is not , or not primarily , a business			0
it is a voice , even a cause			0
it has lasted through numerous transformations of the " media landscape " — transformations that , far from rendering its work obsolete , have made that work ever more valuable			0
' @entity1 is a kind of public trust			0
that is something all its previous owners and publishers understood and respected			0
the legacy has now been trashed , the trust violated			0
