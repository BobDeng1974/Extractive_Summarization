his face a mask of raw shock , a young boy soldier is led away after his friend was killed fighting in @entity5			1
wearing jeans , trainers and an @entity9 t - shirt , he looks like a primary schoolboy but for a green ammunition vest much too big for his small frame and the @entity13 he clutches in his right hand			0
he is one of a rising number of child soldiers – many barely older than ten – recruited by the increasingly desperate rebel @entity17 to fight president @entity19 ’s forces			1
in a heart - wrenching video , he catches sight of the body of his friend @entity24 , who had mustered a group to defend the @entity28 castle @entity26			0
worrying : a young @entity5 boy holding a @entity13 is comforted by a rebel during fighting with government forces on the outskirts of @entity33 tears : the young @entity5 boy holds a hand to his face as he cries after witnessing the horror of a comrade being shot dead in battle			1
he also shouted the dead man 's name overcome with grief : the boy steadies himself after the grizzly event , which occurred in a battle between his rebel fighters and government forces on the outskirts of @entity33 rebel fighters carry the dead fighter away after he was shot , one of a possible 15,000 victims of bloody conflict moments later , @entity24 was dead , his body carried from the frontline by his brother and comrades – who would die five minutes later			1
the boy cries ‘ @entity24 ’ in his unbroken voice in the video – the first time the reality of children fighting on @entity5 ’s frontline has been so vividly captured			2
an older rebel puts a hand on his shoulder as the boy peers around a corner to see @entity24 ’s body being carried away			0
on the verge of tears , he buries his face in his free hand before being led away – still carrying his gun			0
@entity19 claimed today that he has the support of his people - saying he would otherwise have been toppled from power by now			1
in an interview with the @entity82 daily @entity81 newspaper @entity19 contrasted himself with the @entity83 of @entity84 , who was toppled by the @entity85 in 1979			1
violence : smoke can be seen rising from a neighbourhood in @entity33 wrecked : damage can be seen in the district of @entity91 in @entity33 devastation : a burning shop can be seen on a road covered in debris in the @entity97 district in @entity33 ' he led the most important country in the region , he had a powerful army and was supported by the whole world			2
so was he able to stand up against the people ? no , ' @entity19 said			1
' if i had been in the same situation , that is if i did n't have the people behind me , i could not have resisted			0
i would have been overthrown			0
how come i 'm still standing ? ' @entity5 's current bloodshed starting in march 2011 following an initially peaceful revolt against the 42 years of @entity19 family rule			1

@entity19 responded violently to popular demonstrations at the outset of the uprising and has since used tanks , artillery , helicopter gunships , troops and militiamen to try to crush armed rebels and deter @entity5 from challenging his power			1
but he claimed @entity5 was under attack from @entity138 militants			1
' the big game targeting @entity5 is much bigger than we expected , ' @entity19 said			1
' the aim is to break up @entity5 or trigger a civil war			0

' @entity19 's remarks published today betrayed no hint that he was prepared to consider the kind of political transition proposed by @entity171 - @entity170 envoy @entity169 with broad @entity142 and @entity140 backing			2
bizarre : @entity5 president @entity19 claimed in a speech he has the support of his people otherwise he would have been toppled from power long ago			1

' but we are now waging war with terrorist groups , not the people			0
and we will wage war because we have to protect ourselves and our people			0
' an international conference in @entity189 last weekend endorsed proposals for a political transition in @entity5 , but @entity192 denies the plan implies @entity19 's departure , as the @entity195 insists			2

' pieces collected from the wreckage of the @entity82 @entity230 war plane which was shot down by @entity5 over the @entity231 tensions on @entity5 's northern border with @entity82 have also soared since @entity5 shot down a @entity82 reconnaissance @entity230 plane over the @entity231 on june 22 in disputed circumstances			2

@entity252 confirmed on thursday it would not attend the @entity246 talks , which also involve members of @entity5 's fractious opposition			0
@entity257 chancellor @entity256 said she regretted the absence of @entity192 and @entity252			0
' if we have two important powers within the @entity171 not attending such a conference , that is not a positive sign , ' she told a news conference			0
the @entity246 gathering could help by tightening sanctions on @entity5 and further isolating it to ramp up pressure on @entity19 , a senior @entity142 diplomat in @entity268 said earlier this week			2
the diplomat , who asked not to be identified , said any clear @entity192 move away from @entity19 would weaken his position			0
' whether or not the @entity192 have told @entity19 that he is not their best friend , @entity19 certainly believes the @entity192 are his best friend and that sustains ( him ) to a degree			0
' @entity275 said the leader of the opposition @entity276 would be in @entity278 for talks next week , but signalled no change in @entity192 's stance			0
@entity19 has made clear he has no intention of stepping down and can count on staunch support from @entity84			1
' the @entity207 think only of their own interests , but it is the right of the nations in the region , including the great nation of @entity5 , to freely determine their own destiny , and other nations should not impose their own demands , ' @entity84 president @entity284 said on thursday .			1
