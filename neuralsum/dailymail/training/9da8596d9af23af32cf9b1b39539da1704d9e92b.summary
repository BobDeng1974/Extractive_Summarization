by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has issued a bizarre denial of comments made by @entity5 to a @entity7 journalist , which prompted a tabloid attack on @entity10 's foreign minister			1
@entity2 's @entity12 newspaper called ms @entity5 a ' complete fool ' after she told @entity7 last week that @entity10 had to ' manage for the worst ' when dealing with @entity2			1
but , perhaps in an attempt at smoothing diplomatic relations , @entity2 's foreign ministry has denied ms @entity5 ever said that - despite the @entity18 publishing excerpts from the interview to prove it			2
in a statement released by @entity22 spokesperson @entity22 , @entity2 said ms @entity5 never made the remarks and ' the @entity10 side has clarified that with the @entity2 side through diplomatic channel '			1
' @entity10 's history is not short of records of human rights infringement on the aboriginal population , ' the @entity12 reported in its @entity2 and @entity50 editions on monday			2
' the country used to be a place roamed by rascals and outlaws from @entity55			0
perhaps it has to boast its values to cover up its actual lack of confidence in front of @entity62 countries			0
' the newspaper 's editorial described the foreign minister as a ' complete fool ' as it responded to the comments made by ms @entity5 in the @entity7 interview			1
@entity69 is the editor of the @entity2 tabloid , the @entity12 , which published the editorial taking aim at ms @entity5 on monday the @entity2 editorial compared ms @entity5 's comments to that of prime minister @entity76 when he told @entity78 prime minister @entity77 last week that he ' admired the skill and the sense of honour ' of the @entity78 troops who attacked @entity84 during @entity85 ' if @entity76 's words were meant to flatter his visiting @entity78 counterpart @entity77 , @entity5 's provocation appeared to have come out of nowhere , ' the editorial read			1
' the current @entity10 government has been widely considered as inexperienced , particularly in dealing with foreign relations			0
still , the naivety of its foreign minister still surprised @entity2 people			2
' @entity2 is @entity10 's biggest trade partner and has not offended @entity10 in any way			0
@entity5 's verbal provocation made her look more like one of the often pointless ' angry youths ' found in the @entity2 cyber sphere than a diplomat			1
' the editorial compared ms @entity5 's comments to prime minister @entity76 's when he told @entity78 prime minister @entity77 last week that he ' admired the skill and the sense of honour ' of the @entity78 troops who attacked @entity84 during @entity85 @entity10 has relied heavily on the @entity2 market in exports so the @entity111 's stance on @entity2 will fluctuate , according to the newspaper			1
' @entity5 calls for standing up to @entity2 , but what resources does she have to do so with ? the next day , @entity10 leaders will smile at @entity2 again , just as they do now to @entity78 , ' it read			2
' for many @entity2 people , @entity10 is a good place for business , travel and higher education			0
there is no point in @entity2 being overly upset by @entity5 's words			0
' the @entity18 today published an excerpt of the original interview between ms @entity5 and journalist @entity128 , where they were discussing @entity10 's relationship with @entity2			1
' bishop : well , we 're pragmatic and we 're realistic			0
we know that the optimum is deeper engagement ... but we 're also clear - eyed about what could go wrong			0
and so you have to hope for the best but manage for the worst			0

a @entity2 tabloid used a @entity29 colloquialism to call @entity5 a fool
the foreign minister had *pledged* to stand up for @entity10 values and to ' manage for the worst ' when dealing with @entity2
the @entity12 said ms @entity5 was more like the ' angry youths ' found in the @entity2 cyber sphere than a diplomat
they now deny @entity5 said the comments
