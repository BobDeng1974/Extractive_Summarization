foreign office minister @entity39 said while consular staff provided assistance to thousands of travellers , they were not able to ' act as veterinary surgeons '			2
last year the @entity47 's contact centres received more than 365,000 calls from @entity15 nationals and while the vast majority were genuine requests from people who needed help , thousands related to issues that staff were unable to assist with			1
the request for a @entity59 - based @entity11 chef came from an event coordinator in @entity13 who was arranging a @entity61			0
it 's always nice to find some tv channels in your native language when on holiday , but calling the @entity47 to help tune these in is perhaps a step too far a person in @entity35 thought the best department to help treat their cat 's infected paws was the @entity47 a call in the @entity74 asking for assistance with a floral display came after the professional gardener hired to create hanging baskets for a trade fair got ' stage fright '			2

mr @entity39 said : ' it is important for @entity47 consular staff to be able to focus on our most vulnerable customers , such as victims of crime , those who have lost a loved one abroad or people who have been detained or hospitalised overseas			1
' consular staff support thousands of @entity15 nationals who encounter difficulties overseas every year and we handle over 365,000 enquires annually			1
' we will always try to help where we can but there are limits to what we can do , so it 's important for people to be aware of how we can help			0
' we can issue an emergency travel document if your passport is lost or stolen , offer support if you become a victim of crime or visit you in hospital or prison , but we are n't able to pay medical bills , give legal advice or get you out of jail , or indeed act as veterinary surgeons			0
' @entity160 , the head of the @entity47 's global contact centres , said : ' the role of the @entity163 is to help enable consular staff to focus on what is important and to concentrate on those in need , but we continue to receive misdirected enquiries from @entity15 nationals			1
' we receive hundreds of thousands of calls every year and while the vast majority of these are from @entity15 nationals in genuine need of our assistance and services , in 2014 38 per cent were not related to consular support at all			1
' for example , one caller asked us to help find his son 's missing suitcase - as it had apparently been lost by a @entity15 airline , the caller thought the @entity15 consulate would be able to locate it			2
' the @entity47 ’s priority is to protect the welfare of @entity15 nationals abroad , and consular staff will always do their best to assist people when they find themselves in difficulty			1
on tourist in the @entity126 rang the @entity47 to find out where they could get a roast dinner however , it is important for travellers to understand what services we provide before getting in touch			0
there are also some simple pre-travel steps that you can take to reduce the risk of getting into difficulty and needing our help , such as taking out comprehensive travel insurance , researching the destination and any health risks and ensuring access to emergency funds			0
