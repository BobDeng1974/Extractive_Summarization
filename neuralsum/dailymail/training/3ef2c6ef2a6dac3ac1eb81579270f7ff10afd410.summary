@entity44 , @entity48 , and @entity62 , all in @entity45 , follow @entity2 as the most depressing places with @entity64 in @entity58 in fifth place			2
the rest of the top ten is made up of @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity70 , all in @entity58 , followed by @entity71 , @entity45 in ninth and @entity72 , @entity58 , in tenth			1
