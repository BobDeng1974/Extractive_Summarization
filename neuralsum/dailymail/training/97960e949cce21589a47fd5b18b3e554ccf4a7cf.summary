by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:15 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 17:02 est , 3 march 2014 he has been nominated for @entity4 three times before			1
so @entity6 had no doubt been hoping and praying that it would be a case of fourth time lucky when he received a nomination for his role in @entity13			1
however , it was n't to be , and @entity6 , 39 , lost out on an award once again as @entity16 was named best actor for @entity18			1
while @entity6 was gracious in his defeat - almost 20 years after he was first nominated for @entity20 - hundreds of internet memes were created poking fun at the star 's snub			2
better luck next time : @entity6 , who attended the @entity4 with his mother , missed out on an @entity4 for the fourth time at the ceremony on sunday night @entity30 frenzy : hundreds of internet memes were created poking fun at @entity6 's latest @entity4 snub poor @entity6 : several of the memes featured @entity6 in some of his previous roles including 2002 movie @entity36 disappointment : one meme joked @entity6 would 've been even more disappointed that he missed out on being in an epic selfie taken at the ceremony involving @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 among others where 's @entity6 ? the epic @entity4 selfie taken by @entity41 at sunday night 's @entity4 gracious loser : @entity6 congratulated @entity16 , who beat him to the award trending : @entity6 's fans were quick to jump to his defence , with # @entity50 quickly trending the mocking led to # @entity52 trending on the social networking site as people mocked the actor			1
but not all of @entity6 's fans on @entity30 thought his plight was funny as some took to the social networking site to defend him			2
@entity61 tweeted : ' always a bridesmaid , never a bride @entity63 # @entity66 # @entity65 # heartbroken			0
' poking fun : another @entity30 user wrote a series of comical captions on screen grabs of the star from the @entity4 broadcast better luck next time : the star had been nominated for @entity75 for his role in @entity13 snubbed : many of the memes featured photographs of the actor as @entity81 in @entity13 @entity82 ! one meme mocked @entity6 up as animated tv character @entity84 emotional : several of the pictures featured the actor in tears in one of his many movies together with a picture of an @entity4 emotional montage : one meme captured 17 images of the star in tears in a movie complete with a picture of an @entity4 missed out : the meme mocking led to # @entity52 trending on the social networking site as people poked fun at the actor first nominations : @entity6 was nominated in 1994 for @entity20 and then in 2005 for @entity104 not quite : in 2007 he was nominated for @entity105 , while this year he was up for @entity13 and @entity106 wrote : ' @entity13 of @entity107 but the @entity108			1
' @entity110 wrote on @entity30 : ' well , @entity6 still does n't have an oscar			2
i believe my sanity just exploded ... # @entity66			0
' but @entity114 insisted that @entity6 wo n't be letting the defeat get to him , writing : ' he might not have won an @entity4 yet , but the amount of people routing ( sic ) for him to do so means so much more than the award # @entity66			1
' laugh out loud : @entity120 , @entity40 , @entity121 and @entity122 sharing a joke at last year 's @entity4 , while the writing over the image quips they were laughing at @entity6 's expense never the bride : one meme mocked @entity6 up as @entity131 's character in 2008 movie @entity133 , which tells the story of a woman who has been a bridesmaid 27 times teary : one picture featured the @entity13 looking very emotional catch me if you can : @entity6 is mocked up as though he is stealing @entity40 's @entity4 from last year after she fell over while going to collect it words of comfort : the @entity13 director @entity144 knows all about losing he was nominated six times before winning with his seventh nomination for @entity147 the hashtag # @entity148 also started trending shortly after his loss			1
it was also a disappointing evening for @entity152 who , like @entity6 , has received four @entity4 nominations in her career so far			1
she was also the only nominee in the @entity156 category for the 2014 nominations to have never taken home an @entity4 in the past			2
date with mum : the 39 - year - old brought his mother @entity162 to both the @entity4 and the after party losing out : @entity152 also failed to win an @entity4 for the fourth time , after having been nominated for @entity165 winners : @entity16 won @entity75 , @entity167 best actress , @entity168 and @entity169 supporting actor and despite hoping the 2014 ceremony might have been her night , @entity152 lost out on the gong to @entity173 actress @entity167 - who also beat @entity174 to the prize			1
other surprising losers on sunday night included @entity40 , who had originally been considered a shoe - in for @entity178 for her role in @entity165			0
@entity40 would have made it two consecutive years running if she had taken home the prize - having been named @entity156 for @entity183 at the 2013 ceremony			0
however , sunday night was @entity168 's time to shine , as the stunning actress took home the award for 12 years a slave			2
high hopes : @entity40 was nominated in the supporting actress category for @entity165 , but failed to win last year : @entity40 was crowned best actress at the 2013 awards for @entity183 @entity169 was crowned @entity193 at the awards , beating @entity41 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 to the prize			0
meanwhile , @entity6 's appearance at the @entity4 came as it was revealed he is the subject of a new lawsuit due to 2013 movie @entity201 , which he produced			1
the film told the story of the residents of @entity207 in @entity208 , but now some of the locals are suing @entity6 and several others involved with making the film for ' emotional distress '			0
according to @entity213 , the lawsuit was filed on 2nd january , with eight community members insisting the portrayal of them as ' inbred mountain folk from @entity208 ' was unfair			0
the court documents read : ' it is extremely embarrassing to the @entity219			0
plaintiffs and their family members are harassed and discriminated against			0
the children are teased at school			0
