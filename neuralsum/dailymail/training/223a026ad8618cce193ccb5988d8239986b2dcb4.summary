only two years after the duo married , things took a turn for the worse when @entity23 lost his eyesight and was declared legally blind			2
further damage to the nerves in his hands and arms rendered him unable to pursue a career as a masseuse , but the father of three - @entity50 , 13 , honey , 10 , and @entity52 , 5 - admits the hardest thing about his condition is having never seen his children			0
