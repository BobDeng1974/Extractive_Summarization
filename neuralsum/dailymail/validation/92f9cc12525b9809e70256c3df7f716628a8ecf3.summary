thousands of miles from the playground , real lessons of life and death are played out every day in what 's left of the wild world			2
this was one such class in @entity10 's @entity9 , where a lioness taught her cubs how to hunt and kill a wildebeest to stay alive			1
captured by @entity17 photographer @entity16 , the lioness began by circling her prey before her cubs joined the hunt			1
the animal fought back - but outnumbered and separated from the herd , it was only a matter of time before it was overpowered			1
mr @entity16 , a wildlife photographer since 2007 , said : ' it was amazing to watch a mother training her children for when they have to leave the pride			0
' i could n't believe the animal instinct they had			0
the lioness was roaring at them , but they knew exactly how to take down such a large animal			2
' the whole experience only lasted a couple of minutes			0
