@entity0 has called for life bans for any athlete found guilty of doping , amid allegations the practice is widespread in @entity7 sport			1
last week a @entity9 television documentary presented what it claimed was evidence of widespread drugs use , while it also alleged that corruption extends beyond @entity7 and implicated the @entity14 in covering up the abuse			1
the @entity16 says the allegations are untrue , while the @entity14 's independent ethics commission is already investigating the allegations and the @entity18 has revealed it will follow suit			2
@entity0 has called for life bans for any athlete found guilty of intentional doping last week a @entity9 television documentary presented what it claimed was evidence of widespread drugs use @entity0 , the women 's marathon world record holder , described the allegations as ' shocking and sickening ' and despite @entity18 saying that life bans for athletes convicted of doping offences are unenforceable in law , she believes that any athlete guilty of the offence should not be allowed to return to the sport			1
' i would advocate a life ban for anybody intentionally doping but we know that unfortunately that ca n't be implemented for legal reasons , ' @entity0 told @entity46 's @entity45 programme			0
' stepping up to a four - year ban was a big step and i think i 'd like to see sanctions come into place for federations when they pass a certain number of positive cases and certainly for the entourage - that is the coaches and the managers			0
@entity0 , the women 's marathon world record holder , described the allegations as ' shocking and sickening ' @entity0 feels a life ban would be adequate for any athlete caught or found guilty of intentional doping ' the independent testing bodies maybe need to be taken away from countries if they ca n't be trusted and i think sanctions for that country competing in events like the world championships , like the @entity69			2
' if it is true that 99 per cent of athletes are cheating then maybe @entity7 should not be in the world championships and not take part in the next @entity69			0
' i think it should n't just be @entity7 that 's singled out here but any country that is n't abiding by the @entity18 code of practice , and in athletics the @entity14 code of practice and anti-doping rules , and implementing sanctions and testing as they should , then maybe we should look at whether they are allowed to take part in the world championships			0
