by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 07:02 est , 26 september 2013 comedy panel shows may be considered by some as one of the lowest forms of humour - but top comedian @entity6 insists that they are in fact wittier than sitcoms or sketch shows			1
the popular funnyman has written his own sketch show and hosted panel programmes as well as appearing in long - running sitcom @entity13			2
he said today that of all the forms of comedy , panels give the greatest scope for spontaneous creativity because they are improvised by skilled comedians			1
panel show : @entity6 , who will soon by appearing on @entity22 with @entity23 and @entity24 , has defended the controversial tv format mr @entity6 , whose new panel show is about to debut on @entity27 , was responding to claims by writer @entity29 that scripted comedy had been squeezed out of the schedules by cheaper alternatives			1
the former @entity34 star told @entity35 that there had been no successful sketch shows since @entity38 , adding : ' they are quite expensive to make and panel shows are also cheaper			1
' but mr @entity6 , 39 , suggested that the rise of panel shows might be no bad thing - despite having made his name in @entity13 and sketch show @entity44			1
he said that his forthcoming show , @entity22 ? , provided a level of spontaneity which could not be matched by scripted comedy			1
origins : mr @entity6 first made his name on @entity27 sitcom @entity13 alongside @entity49 @entity50 ) : @entity6 's new show , also featuring @entity24 and @entity23 , is based on quotations and premieres on october 6			2
@entity54 ( @entity55 ) : the comedian has been a team captain on the show , in which guests try to discern truth from falsehood , since it started in 2007			0
the bubble ( @entity62 ) : mr @entity6 hosted the 2010 show in which celebrities were kept in isolation for a week and then made to work out what had really happened in the news in their absence			0
@entity69 ( @entity70 ) : he also presents the long - running radio show in which guests give made - up lectures mixing lies with true facts			0
other shows : mr @entity6 has been a popular presence as a guest on @entity79 , have i got news for you , @entity83 , 8 out of 10 cats and @entity85			2
' there was a quote from @entity88 about playing golf with her husband @entity90 , ' he told the @entity91			0
' we essentially all started to imagine the scene of the two of them playing golf and that was very enjoyable and turned into a really fun bit of tv			0
' it is moments like that which , for me , justify the existence of panel shows because no - one would ever have written those words			1
it purely came out of that combination of people which proves panel shows can produce funny tv in a way you could never write into a sitcom or a sketch show and thereby justifies its place on screen			1
' the programme , which debuts next weekend and features @entity23 and @entity24 as team captains , is based on questions about quotations and tweets			0
it is not the first panel show on which mr @entity6 has regularly featured - he is a team captain on @entity54 , and hosted @entity62 's short - lived the bubble			2
in addition , he has been a frequent guest on @entity38 's most popular panel shows such as have i got news for you , @entity83 , 8 out of 10 cats and @entity79			2
he said that the key to a good panel show is allowing the guests the space to come up with creative jokes			0
' usually the panellists are people who are bright and want to talk , and you need them to keep talking so you ca n't slap them down hard because they might go quiet and then you 're stuck , ' he added			0
' you never know in that kind of comic situation where a chat is going and some of the best material comes when things are allowed to run and breathe			0

@entity34 star @entity29 claimed panel shows had squeezed out scripted comedy from the schedules
