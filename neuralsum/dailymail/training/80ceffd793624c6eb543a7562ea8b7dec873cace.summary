a pair of experimental @entity2 vaccines that protect monkeys from the fatal disease ravaging @entity5 have been developed			1
the vaccine is effective for at least five weeks in lab monkeys but requires boosting with an additional vaccine to extend its protection to 10 months , according to a new study			1
the findings offer a glimpse of which - if any - of the @entity2 vaccines in development will prove effective , and in what form			2
pharmaceutical firms are accelerating their efforts to provide @entity2 vaccines and treatments as the worst known outbreak of the virus tears through @entity5 , killing more than 2,000 people			1
pictured , workers stand in the contaminated area at the @entity31 hospital in @entity32 yesterday the worst known outbreak of the ebola virus has ravaged @entity5 , killing more than 2,000 people			0
the results of the new study suggest , for instance , that a vaccine by pharma giant @entity39 ( @entity39 ) now being tested on healthy volunteers will protect against @entity2 infection in the short term , but may have to be augmented for long - term protection			1
the study , published in @entity45 , is the first to report that a vaccine regimen produced ' durable immunity ' against @entity2 , protecting four out of four monkeys for 10 months			1
the vaccine uses a chimp adenovirus , closely related to a human version that causes upper respiratory tract infections , into which scientists spliced an @entity2 gene			1
the adenovirus infects cells in a vaccinated animal , causing them to take up the gene and produce @entity2 proteins			1
that primes the immune system to attack the proteins of @entity2 viruses when an infection occurs			2
race for life : a vaccine candidate , in a vial , that will be used in the upcoming human @entity2 trials			1

a third experimental @entity2 vaccine uses a different delivery system , a livestock pathogen called vesicular stomatitis virus ( @entity84 )			2
a version developed by the @entity86 and licensed to @entity87 is scheduled to be tested for safety in healthy volunteers this fall			0
@entity90 is also developing a @entity84 vaccine			0
in the new study , led by @entity93 of the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) , researchers sought to see whether a double dose of vaccine in a regimen called ' prime - boost ' would address two different clinical needs			0
health workers carry the body of a man , right , suspected of dying from the ebola virus and left in the street , in the capital city of @entity32 , @entity107 , last month one is protecting against @entity2 immediately , said @entity94 director dr @entity109 , as when a person is heading to an area with an @entity2 outbreak			2
in the study , an adenovirus vaccine essentially the same as @entity39 's does so : four of four vaccinated macaque monkeys given otherwise lethal doses of @entity2 five weeks later survived and had no detectable virus in their blood			1
all unvaccinated monkeys died within six days			0
the other need is to protect someone whose stay in an ebola zone lasts months			0
here , the adeno vaccine faltered at one dose : when eight vaccinated macaques were exposed to @entity2 10 months later , six died			1
with a new group of macaques , however , the scientists followed the initial adeno vaccine eight weeks later with a booster shot using a different carrier virus , called @entity133 ( modified vaccine @entity134 ) and carrying the same @entity2 gene			1
this time , all four infected monkeys were still protected at 10 months			1
the human trial of the @entity39 vaccine uses a single adenovirus dose : regulators require safety trials to test each element of a regimen separately , said @entity94 's @entity109 , so any adverse events can be traced more easily			0

the ebola virus is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids @entity39 also plans to test a two - dose prime - boost version , said spokeswoman @entity154			0
@entity78 's @entity2 vaccine consists of an adenovirus prime followed by an @entity133 boost made by @entity158			2
' after the boost , protection is not only stronger but also longer - lasting , ' said @entity78 spokesman @entity160			0
@entity161 of the @entity162 works on the @entity84 - based @entity2 vaccine being developed by @entity90			2
he questioned the practicality of a two - shot vaccine regimen			0
' you really need a fast - acting single injection vaccine ' for protecting a community during an outbreak or preparing first responders and healthcare workers , he said			0
only @entity84 vaccines have been shown to protect lab monkeys when given after infection with @entity2 , @entity161 said : ' this makes it so much more useful than any of the other vaccines			1
for outbreaks , it works fast			0

one vaccine protects lab monkeys from disease for five weeks
it can be augmented with another vaccine , protecting animals for 10 months
