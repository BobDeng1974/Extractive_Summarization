by @entity0 more than 1,000 passports could be issued to ‘ suspect ’ overseas applicants because staff are not carrying out standard checks due to the huge backlog at the @entity7			1
these documents could be issued within the next fortnight , sources within @entity7 ( @entity7 ) claim , despite home secretary @entity12 ’s vow that security would not be compromised			1
the security loophole has been exposed after staff in the @entity7 ’s ‘ @entity16 ’ were diverted to help clear up the chaos elsewhere			1
passport applications awaiting to be processed at an office in @entity20 due to a massive backlog these highly trained officials are usually responsible for carrying out multiple fraud checks on documents sent in with overseas applications			1
the problem is being compounded by the drafting in of inexperienced staff who are unable to spot suspicious answers on applications and alert the @entity16			2
a source told @entity38 : ‘ all hands are being called to the pumps and the @entity16 is now like one man and a dog for the rest of the month with the majority of staff transferred to other duties			2
‘ the @entity16 estimates that within the next couple of weeks , because of this panic , there will be at least 1,000 “ unsecure ” passports issued to “ suspect ” persons			1
’ last week , @entity12 confirmed that responsibility for dealing with applications for passports overseas had switched three months ago from @entity51 consulates abroad to an online system based in the @entity51 monitored by @entity7			1
she said the change was made to provide better value for money and to ensure more ‘ consistency ’ of service			0
she stressed that security would not be compromised			2
but the @entity7 source added : ‘ at one of the major @entity7 hubs , in @entity62 , they ’ve now been lumped with passport applications from every registry throughout the world , which have to be checked , double - checked and triple - checked			1
the @entity16 handles the potentially fraudulent applications and subjects them to rigid scrutiny			0
home secretary @entity12 has vowed that security will not be comprised while the passport application backlog is tackled ‘ there is a template system in place to sift suspicious applications which @entity7 staff have been trained to recognise			1
‘ but the government is drafting in inexperienced @entity77 staff to help			0
the problem is that they will not recognise certain key answers that would alert full - time staff			0
’ the @entity16 was set up after it was discovered ‘ bulk ’ applications mainly by @entity85 gangsters were being made for @entity51 passports and a small number had been processed			2
as the @entity62 team picked up on the problem , it was decided to base the unit there			0
last week , leaked documents from the @entity7 revealed a plan to ‘ relax ’ checks on applications from overseas			1
the @entity97 said it had been ‘ unaware ’ of the proposed change and ordered the guidelines to be withdrawn			0
an @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ security is our priority and we will not issue a passport until all necessary checks have been satisfactorily completed			1
’ meanwhile , civil servants at @entity7 received bonuses worth more than £ 1.8 million last year , @entity38 can reveal			2
the bonuses were paid out to thousands of employees for ‘ good performance ’ at the service , which now has a backlog of 500,000 applications			0
more than 94 per cent received the ‘ in - year ’ bonus , supposed to be handed out to staff who have exceeded ‘ key business targets ’			0
@entity115 , the former chief executive , received a bonus worth between £ 5,000 and £ 10,000 in 2012/13			0
on tuesday the current chief executive , @entity117 , will go before the @entity118 to face questioning over the crisis			0
@entity121 , the chairman of the committee , told @entity38 : ‘ it is unbelievable that bonuses have been paid to those who have presided over a service that is now a byword for incompetence			0

staff from ' @entity130 ' drafted in to help process passport applications
fear more than 1,000 ' suspect ' overseas applications may be issued as checks are not carried out
overseas applications transferred to an online system based in @entity51 3 months ago
but @entity7 say security is a priority when issuing passports
