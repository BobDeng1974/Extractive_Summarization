@entity1 's nightmarish start to the @entity3 season continues			1
after eight games , the @entity5 finalists of 2013 have notched up a mere seven points , and conceded fourteen goals			1
defeat to newly promoted @entity9 on saturday meant that they were unable to haul themselves off a miserable 14th place in the table			1
no wonder @entity14 looks more exasperated with each passing weekend			2
neither the charming sense of humour nor the defiant bursts of anger are anywhere to be seen at the moment			0
@entity14 simply looks at a loss			2
' we 're playing a kind of football which does n't make any sense			0
our passing is dreadful , we 're making simple mistakes			0
there are various explanations for it , ' he said after the defeat to @entity9			1
it would be easy to think that it was a personnel issue			0
@entity1 have lost @entity50 and @entity51 to @entity52 in the last 18 months , and players like @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 are only just returning from injuries			1
gundogan aside , however , the absentees are all forwards			0
@entity1 's problems are not in their attacking play , where new signings @entity33 , @entity63 and @entity41 have proved themselves to be reasonable replacements			1
it is in defence that @entity14 's team are becoming a laughing stock			1
' we 're constantly creating chances , and most of the time we 're converting chances			0
that 's usually enough to win games , ' said @entity14			1
@entity1 were hampered by injuries to @entity54 ( left ) and @entity55 ahead of the season he is right			1
@entity1 's defence has been an eight - episode comedy box set of errors this season , complete with sloppy passing , dreadful positioning and embarrassing individual mistakes			1
the defence has not been overrun by superior opposition , it has gifted goals to significantly weaker teams like @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and most recently @entity9			2
that last defeat sparked an angry response from director of sport @entity94			0
' we 're seeing serious slip - ups from players who are supposedly leaders , ' he ranted			0
it was quite clear to whom he was referring			0
@entity102 , newly crowned captain and target of many a @entity105 club , has failed catastrophically to organise a coherent back line this season			1
it is n't just @entity109 , of course			0
as @entity14 says , the whole team has a problem at the moment			2
the coach has taken primary responsibility , but insists he is staying in his job : ' if i thought for a moment that i was somehow the thing disturbing the team , i would say , " thanks guys , it 's been great , but my time 's up "			0
but i do n't think that			0
' @entity1 captain @entity102 ( right ) has been scrutinised for his side 's defensive problems at the back @entity14 is certainly in no danger from above			1
his success with the club over the last few years means he has a lot more breathing space than most coaches , and rightly so			0
even the media are not on his back			0
one opinion piece in @entity137 even said that @entity1 ' can be relaxed , even in crisis '			2
there are also some positives to be taken from the @entity5			2
@entity1 top their group after two games , and look an altogether different team when playing in @entity144 , as @entity145 found to their dismay last month			2
a victory over @entity148 on wednesday would be exactly the kind of thing @entity14 's side are in need of			1
a confidence boost , but also a reminder that if they are going to be playing in the same competition next season , they had better get their act together in the @entity3			0
@entity33 was on target in @entity1 's 2 - 0 @entity5 win against @entity145 in september			1

@entity1 lost 2 - 1 at @entity9 in the @entity3 on saturday
defeat leaves club 14th in the table , on seven points , after eight games
captain @entity102 has come under *criticism* in defence
@entity14 has *branded* his side 's football as ' *pointless* '
@entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 have been injured
@entity1 are *unbeaten* in the @entity5 so far
