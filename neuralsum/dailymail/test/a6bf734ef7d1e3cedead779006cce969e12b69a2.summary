it may have taken 170 minutes to come but super sub @entity1 earned @entity2 a place in the @entity5 semi-finals after breaking @entity7 hearts with a late winner on thursday night			1
the midfielder latched on to a @entity11 pass as the @entity13 's hit on the counter attack to settle a tie that looked to be heading for extra-time after last week 's goalless draw in @entity18			1
the @entity18 league leaders set the record for most @entity5 games unbeaten after the stalemate took them to 11 without loss since the opening game of the group stage earlier this season			1
@entity1 broke the deadlock in the final 10 minutes with a left - footed drive that took a slight deflection @entity32 goalkeeper @entity31 can do nothing to stop @entity1 's effort finding the net @entity1 leads the celebrations after netting the winner for @entity2 to book a @entity5 semi-final place but their @entity40 dream came crashing down at the at the @entity42 during an evening that offered little in the way of quality			1
the visitors started the game brightly as @entity48 and @entity49 combined to good effect down the right but , after carving the @entity7 defence open , could only win a corner			0
but the @entity55 outfit soon settled into the game and took control of proceedings			0
@entity59 , perennially linked with a move to the @entity61 was a constant threat down the @entity2 left			0
first he weaved his way into the penalty area with a jinking run but was eventually crowded out before the @entity55 international test @entity7 keeper @entity31 with the first meaningful effort of the match			1
@entity2 midfielder @entity1 slides to his knees in celebration after earning his side a place in the last four the @entity2 players mob the goalscorer as his effort sends them into the @entity5 semi-finals @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 ( @entity82 90 +1 ) , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 ( @entity1 46 ) , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 ( @entity91 72 ) subs not used : @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 scorer ( s ) : @entity1 82 booked : @entity98 , @entity99 manager : @entity101 @entity7 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity31 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 ( @entity110 70 ) , @entity111 ( @entity112 86 ) , storm ( @entity114 86 ) subs not used : @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 booked : @entity110 manager : @entity121 referee : @entity123 ( @entity124 ) the winger unleashed a well struck free kick from all of 30 yards , but the effort was straight at the @entity32 no 1			1
the home side pressed for an opener as @entity59 continued to cause the @entity7 backline problems as the winger tormented the right - hand side of the @entity7 defence			2
and @entity2 could have been in front on the half - hour mark but @entity90 fired off target after being picked out in the area by @entity87			2
the @entity13 were almost gifted an opening goal moments before half - time after a miscommunication between @entity31 and defender @entity140 that had manager @entity141 shaking his head in disbelief			0
just minutes after the restart @entity2 again came close to breaking the deadlock			0
this time it was @entity59 who , after collecting @entity11 's brilliant ball over the top , fired an effort agonisingly wide of the far post			0
@entity7 continued to defend for their lives as the visitors seemed intent on preserving their unbeaten record in the competition this season			0
the dangerous @entity157 shields his face as he flies into a challenge with @entity108 @entity2 forward @entity87 vies for the ball with @entity108 during the quarter - final clash in a rare foray into the final third substitute @entity162 let fly with a 30 - yard strike that narrowly missed the target as the game looked to be heading for an extra 30 minutes			2
@entity7 began to take more opportunities as the game neared the final 15 minutes , and it proved their undoing			0
@entity2 broke swiftly and @entity88 released @entity1 , a half - time substitute , who cut in on his left foot and beat @entity31 courtesy of a slight deflection			1
@entity7 made a late double change in a bid salvage their place in the competition but it was too little , too late as @entity182 dream continues .			2

@entity2 beat @entity7 1 - 0 in @entity55 to earn place in @entity5 last four
@entity1 scored the tie 's only goal in the 82nd minute on thursday
the first leg between the two sides finished goalless in @entity18 last week
