scroll down to watch the cctv cheeky cat @entity17 , now known as @entity17 the menace to his neighbours , with his haul of stolen goods he has taken men ’s boxer shorts , a pair of shoes , a cardigan , a dog chew , dozens of pairs of socks , a chamois leather , tea towels , seven car sponges and a cuddly toy			1
victims of the two - year - old black and white cat ’s antics often turn up at mrs @entity15 ’s home in @entity50 , @entity51 , when their belongings go missing			1
the first theft was recorded just a week after he was let out of the house for the first time , with his stolen stash growing week on week until he began carrying home t - shirts in his mouth , often having to jump over garden fences along the way			2
his largest prize to date is a bath towel which he dragged through the streets and his most expensive is a @entity64 polo short			0
on one occasion he retrieved a woman ’s sandal from a garden in a neighbouring road - and returned a week later to pinch the other one			0
many of the items have fallen off washing lines as they often have clothes pegs still attached			2
@entity28 footage captures @entity17 carrying a bike helmet bag in his mouth on to the family 's driveway on another occasion he is caught on camera with a hand towel between his teeth @entity17 also works at night , pictured in the dark pushing his loot through the cat flap and taking it up to mrs @entity15 in bed mrs @entity15 , an accounts assistant , has built up two large boxes filled with @entity17 ’s loot which she keeps in case anyone arrives to claim ownership of them			1
she said : ‘ @entity17 is a rescue cat and we have had him since he was six - weeks - old			1
‘ after he had been neutered i let him and my other cat , @entity96 , out for the first time when they were six - months - old			2
‘ it was just a week after that when @entity17 brought his first things home			1
it started off as a sock and some paper , but gradually escalated			0
‘ it was n’t just lighter items like a pair of pants , there were heavier things such as a @entity111 doll in and a bath towel			0
' he has completely filled two large boxes			0
' i tracked down the lady who lost her sandals and @entity17 would have had to scale five 6ft fences to get there and back			2
@entity15 said the naughty pet often brings other people 's belongings to her in bed believing they are prey @entity17 's crime spree started just a week after he was allowed out of the house for the first time , regularly carrying home items like pants and t - shirts in his mouth embarrassed mrs @entity15 shows off the two boxes full of clothing and toys that two - year - old @entity17 has pinched over the last 18 months ‘ i would say he has taken well over 100 things now , so i have started collecting them up and if people are looking for something , i tell them to knock on my door			1
‘ i have never tried to stop his behaviour , i would much rather him bring objects into the house than dead animals			0
thieving cat @entity17 has been affectionately called ' @entity144 ' by neighbours after the troublesome cartoon character , pictured ‘ he normally leaves them outside the front door but some of the time he will bring them up to me bed while i am asleep			1
‘ he obviously thinks all these items are prey			0
’ @entity154 , a cat behaviourist , said : ‘ there are so many different theories on why cats steal , but i think it ’s a basic hunting instinct			0
‘ i have seen many cats steal all sorts of things and bring them in through the cat flap and carry items as if they were prey			1
‘ it ’s relatively common in cats for them to do this , and it could be the process of finding an object , grabbing it , and taking it back that they like , not actually the item itself			0
‘ or , it could be the texture and feel of certain items in their mouths that they like , which could be why certain things are taken time and time again			0
‘ all of these things can easily make them develop a habit , and @entity17 has become a bit of a huntaholic			2

@entity17 pinches everything from towels to toys from his neighbours and carries or drags them home through his cat flap
owner @entity15 , 49 , from @entity50 , has two boxes full of stolen items for neighbours to collect
