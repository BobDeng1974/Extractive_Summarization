residents of @entity2 have been banned from leaving by @entity3 , which has cut the phone lines and locked down the @entity6 city in preparation for an expected assault by government forces , it has been reported			1
resentment has grown among residents living under the iron - fisted rule of the extremists in the country 's second - largest city â€“ and now they have no option but to endure it			1
one local , @entity17 , told how @entity3 will only allow people to leave for a maximum of 10 days			1
if you do n't come back , they are punished			0
people are trying to leave @entity2			1
they closed the hospitals because they have no electricity or water			0
' another resident told the paper that the phones had been cut for security reasons , as the jihadists feared that locals were revealing their military positions to government forces			2
local @entity46 said he was recently forced to pull his three children out of school			0
the cost of living has soared there , and the family is barely able to make ends meet , even after putting the kids to work			0
' we are not able to pay for cooking gas , kerosene and food , ' the 56 - year old retired government worker says			2
' the situation in @entity2 is miserable			2
' the economy in the self - styled ' caliphate ' declared by the @entity64 group bridging @entity6 and @entity65 is starting to show signs of strain			1
prices of most staples have more than doubled as coalition airstrikes and ground operations make it difficult for products to move in and out of militant strongholds , leading to shortages , price - gouging and the creation of black markets			2
the economy in the self - styled ' caliphate ' declared by the @entity64 group bridging @entity6 and @entity65 is starting to show signs of strain members of the @entity6 security forces carry their weapons during an intensive security deployment on the outskirts of @entity85 , a city lying to the south of @entity2 the jihadists initially won support with their ability to deliver services			1
in the early days of its rule , the @entity64 group subsidized food and gas prices through the wealth it accumulated from oil smuggling , extortion and ransom demands			0
they sold their smuggled oil at a discount - $ 25 to $ 60 for a barrel for oil that normally sold for more than $ 100 , according to analysts and government officials			2
but in recent weeks , prices have soared in militant - held cities			2
items like kerosene , used for heating and cooking , are in short supply , while others , such as alcohol and cigarettes , strictly banned by the group , are making a comeback at higher prices on the black market			2
smoking is a punishable offense in militant - held @entity2			1
but at a warehouse on the outskirts of the city , cigarettes , as well as hard - to - come - by essentials like kerosene , can be found at hugely inflated prices on a black market run by the extremists			2
there , a pack of cigarettes sells for 30,000 dinars - the equivalent of $ 26 - more than double the pre-caliphate price , according to residents who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals			2
the militants ' are developing an unsustainable economy , ' said @entity141 , an expert on @entity143 economies at the @entity144 in @entity145			2
' eventually the costs of keeping the subsidies and price controls going will overpower their smuggling funds , which are also used for offensive and defensive actions			2
' a member of the @entity6 security forces takes his position with his weapon during an intensive security deployment on the outskirts of @entity85 , south of @entity2 ' @entity3 can not float government bonds like nations can , ' @entity141 added , using an alternate acronym for the group			1
' they can collect taxes , extort money , and so forth			0
but that will likely not be enough in the long run to keep such an unbalanced economic system going			0
' in the @entity65 city of @entity174 , the extremists ' so - called capital , the breakdown of security along the @entity65 - @entity6 border in areas under islamic state control has led to flourishing trade with @entity2			1
trucks are also able to access the city from @entity180 , residents said , allowing for a steady supply of fruit and vegetables , wheat and textiles			0
however , the cost of living has surged since @entity188 - led airstrikes began in @entity65 in september , and power and water cuts grew more frequent , they said			1
in addition , the strict social laws imposed by the group have been very bad for business , said @entity195 , an activist in the @entity64 - controlled town of @entity197 in @entity65 's northern @entity199 province			1
but , he said , foreign fighters were bringing with them lots of hard currency , making up somewhat for the shortfall			0
last month , @entity203 , the leader of the @entity64 group , decreed the minting of gold , silver and copper coins for the militants ' own currency - the @entity212 dinar - to ' change the tyrannical monetary system ' modelled on @entity215 economies			0
however , trade in most militant - held cities continues to be in @entity6 dinars and @entity188 dollars			1
the start of winter has led to serious shortages of gasoline and kerosene in @entity6 's militant - held territories			1
the official price for a liter of gas in government - controlled areas is 450 dinars ( 40 cents ) - but in @entity2 , it sells for four times that , or 1,700 dinars			1
two hundred - liter barrels of kerosene are now sold in @entity2 for 250,000 dinars ( $ 220 ) , versus the official price of 30,000 dinars			1
in the western @entity6 city of @entity239 , under militant control for almost a year , residents have started cutting trees for firewood because kerosene is in such short supply			1
the city is surrounded by government troops and near - daily shelling often make parts of town too dangerous to visit			0
food and fuel prices have risen sharply as a result - a 50 - kilo sack of rice costs 75,000 dinars ( $ 65 ) , up from 10,000 ( $ 9 ) about three months ago			0
a cylinder of cooking gas goes for 140,000 dinars ( $ 115 )			0
a number of factors are driving the shortages and price hikes , according to residents in @entity2 and @entity239 , the group 's biggest @entity6 strongholds			1
the militants have imposed a tax on trucks and other vehicles entering their territory , which has led to a decline in business			0
deliveries are also subject to militant theft , and coalition airstrikes and military operations make many roads impassable			0
as a result , the trip from the @entity180 border to @entity2 took four hours prior to the militant takeover			2
now , a delivery truck can spend as much as a week traveling the same road , and will ultimately pay a tax of as much as $ 300 for entry into @entity2 , residents said			1
according to @entity286 , director of the @entity288 and a visiting fellow at the @entity290 , the population of the areas the @entity64 group controls in @entity6 and @entity65 is 6.5 million to 8 million people			1
' they need 150,000 barrels ( of crude ) a day just to meet local consumption , ' he said			0
' and that is the bare minimum to meet the demands for transportation , bakeries , power generation			0
' ' that does n't mean they have access to such supply , ' he added			0
last month , the militants shut down cell phone service in @entity2 , claiming that residents were tipping off @entity188 - led coalition airstrikes to their whereabouts			1
cell signals have not been restored , causing the city to come to a virtual standstill			0
workshops , factories and markets are closed and bitterness is growing among business owners			0
' most money - transfer operations are done by mobile calls , ' said @entity321 , the owner of a money - transfer office in @entity2			1
' we have the option of using the @entity325 , but this method is very slow and sometimes the @entity325 does not work at all , which causes big delays to our work			0
' at @entity330 's shop in @entity2 , the pile of cell phone scratch cards is growing higher by the day			1
' our business and means for living are in ruins now , ' he said			0
meanwhile , @entity64 group militants shot down an @entity6 military helicopter on saturday , officials said , killing the two pilots onboard and raising fresh concerns about the extremists ' ability to attack aircraft			2
the attack happened in the @entity347 holy city of @entity85 , about 95 kilometers ( 60 miles ) north of @entity29			0
a member of the @entity6 security forces walks past a destroyed vehicle belonging to @entity64 militants during an intensive security deployment on the outskirts of @entity85 a senior @entity355 official told @entity356 the @entity358 militants used a shoulder - fired rocket launcher to shoot down the @entity361 helicopter on the outskirts of the city			1
an army official corroborated the information			0
both spoke on condition of anonymity as they were n't authorized to speak to journalists			0
the @entity361 , built by @entity370 , is used for transport , surveillance and combat			0
the militants shot down at least two other @entity6 military helicopters near the city of @entity377 in october			2
some fear the militants may have captured ground - to - air missiles capable of shooting down airplanes when they overran @entity6 and @entity65 army bases this summer			1
@entity384 airlines including @entity385 , @entity386 and @entity387 , @entity188 carrier @entity388 and @entity390 - based @entity389 changed their commercial flight plans over the summer to avoid @entity6 airspace			1
the @entity188 - trained @entity6 military virtually collapsed in the face of the militants ' blitz , shedding their uniforms and abandoning sophisticated weapons near the northern city of @entity2			1
a pro-iraqi government fighter looks on holding a machine gun during a siege with the @entity64 group on the outskirts of the @entity347 area of @entity406 in the @entity408 province , north of @entity409 pro-iraqi government fighters walk past sandbags during a siege with @entity64			0
