by @entity0 former boxing promoter @entity1 , who is now living as a woman , has said her transgender struggle led her to attempt suicide			1
the 61 - year - old , now known as @entity6 , guided boxer @entity7 to lift the world heavyweight boxing title during a successful career			1
@entity1 , who was last night backed by @entity7 and other sporting personalities for telling her story , told how she could not cope with leading a double life			1
i could n't go on and i had to end it , ' the father - of - three told the @entity23			1
' i had always believed that suicide was the coward 's way out but my life was being torn apart			2
' she explained that she went home at @entity30 in 2012 in a last attempt to rescue her marriage			2
but it turned into an ' absolute disaster ' and at one point , she said , she went out to walk the dogs and attempted suicide			2
the next day she broke down and told her daughter how she had lived her life feeling trapped in the wrong body			1
in a lengthy interview she had told the newspaper she is now undergoing gender reassignment therapy			0
@entity1 , pictured as a man , is now undergoing gender reassignment therapy she thanked the public for the positive reaction she received , including comments on social media from former footballer @entity50 and boxing commentator @entity51			0
reacting to the news @entity7 said he respects @entity1 's decision			1
@entity7 said : ' i was just as shocked as anyone at the news about my former promoter and my initial thought was that it was a wind up			1
the great thing about life , and boxing , is that , day to day , you never know what to expect			0
' this world we live in is n't always cut and dried or black and white , and coming from the boxing fraternity , i can only imagine what a difficult decision this must be for @entity6			1
top of their game : @entity1 ( in @entity73 suit ) , right , with @entity75 @entity74 , left , in @entity76 in october 1997 ' however , having taken some time to read @entity6 's statements , i understand better what she , and others in similar situations , are going through			1
i think that all people should be allowed to live their lives in a way that brings them harmony and inner peace			2
' i respect @entity6 's decision and say that if this is what brings about true happiness in her life , than so be it			1
' @entity1 announced his intention to call time on his 30 - year career with immediate effect last october			1
his decision brought an end to a colourful career which saw him guide @entity7 to glory despite memorably being derided as a ' mental midget ' by @entity102 promoter @entity101			1
@entity7 said on @entity103 when @entity1 retired : ' @entity104 up 2 @entity1 on a massive career in the fight game			1
gon na miss those @entity73 suits			0
all the best to u and urs			0
' @entity1 's garish suits might have earned him fame as @entity7 's sidekick , but his jovial image belied a shrewd boxing brain as he swerved @entity101 's obstacles to lead @entity7 to the top			1
@entity1 said when he retired : ' boxing has given me some great times but it 's not the same business i grew to love any more			0
' the characters have gone and gradually over the last six months i have realised that i do n't want to be involved in it any more			0
' by @entity122 transgender writer and campaigner while many might be shocked by @entity1 ’s transition into @entity6 , it comes as no surprise to me			1
there ’s no rule which says that hairdressers are more likely to be transgender than sporting professionals			2
if anything , the opposite holds true			0
there is so much blame and shame about being transgender that many will do all they can to hide it – often taking up careers that exaggerate their birth gender			2
so men may be more macho and women more feminine			0
it can make the transition more of a shock to other people , but not to those who have been through it			2
for me , that was four years ago			0
happily settled with my partner of seven years and two young children , i decided aged 52 that i could no longer live as a man and needed to become ‘ @entity156 ’			0
support often arrives from unexpected directions			0
i was working as a science and technology writer , and the atmosphere in the office was laddish			0
i dreaded returning to work as @entity156 , but i was surprised and grateful for the nonchalant way my male colleagues reacted			0
one said of my painted nails ‘ the colour does n’t suit you ’ , while the rest just got on with work as usual			0
my partner stood by me			0
and that ’s how it should be			0
my heart goes out to @entity6			1
transition opens the door to public abuse and discrimination – but for some people changing gender is necessary , and my own experience shows it can lead to happiness .			2

@entity7 ' former mentor , 61 , now lives as a woman called @entity6
*reveals* she is now more than a year into a two - year transition period
transgender struggle led her to attempt suicide as she failed to cope
but she eventually broke down and confessed all to her *eldest* daughter
