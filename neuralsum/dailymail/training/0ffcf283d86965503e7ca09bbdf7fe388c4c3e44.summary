the @entity0 - the golden basin - sounds like something hidden and precious			1
this is a part of @entity5 , deep in the @entity7 region , that not even @entity5 insiders know about			1
it ’s a place you might stumble across , if you were lost			1
although it ’s only a 60 - mile drive from @entity13 , i got lost and did not have a sat - nav , so it was well after midnight before i finally collapsed in my bed in the @entity16			1
the @entity17 is just outside the village of @entity19 ; and @entity19 is where you head to discover the @entity22			1
a hilltop haven : the little village of @entity19 neatly encapsulates the beauty of the region after breakfast , we strolled into the village			1
below , the gentle hills and valleys of the @entity0 dozed away the summer			2
the bakery and cafe were doing steady business			2
@entity19 has a population of 979 , not many of whom were in evidence			1
a couple of older citizens sat on a bench and discussed life			2
there was not much traffic other than the occasional farmer ’s van or another visibly lost hire car			2
but in the distance there was a sound that was distinctly at odds with these tranquil , timeless surroundings			2
we walked towards the cacophony			2
here , in the land of cantatas and madrigals , someone was playing the @entity59 rockers @entity58 at full blast - in a butcher ’s shop			1
people , some of them with wine glasses in hand , were spilling onto the pavement			2
inside , the place was packed with a crowd laughing and drinking			0
it was not like any other butcher ’s shop i ’d ever known			1
but then it belongs to @entity74 : possibly the world ’s only celebrity butcher			1
fragrantly fertile : the fields and slopes of @entity7 swarm with vineyards @entity74 looks a bit like @entity82 ’s jovial @entity81 cousin			0
he has demonic eyebrows , a large , hooked nose and burly frame			0
all the international superstar chefs know him : @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89			0
his shop is a place of pilgrimage for those who care about meat			0
it is also a restaurant			0
at lunch , under the vines and on long tables , we ate course after course of his succulent beef			0
there were glasses of majestic @entity108 reds			0
and the best guide to the @entity0 is the man who makes that wine : @entity112			0
if @entity74 is a @entity5 @entity82 , @entity112 is an @entity81 @entity113 : tanned , beautifully dressed , dryly humorous			1
after lunch , he drove us around his 80 - hectare estate			1
so what is the @entity118 ? sculpted into the hills 2,000ft high , it ’s a fertile valley once famous for its golden corn - hence the name			1
today , the corn has gone and the @entity118 is a kind of heaven for wine - growers and cheese - makers , as well as butchers , @entity130 chefs and @entity58 fans			1
the south - facing slopes are perfect for @entity112 ’s wonderful organic wines			1
his vines are interspersed with barley to feed his @entity137 cows			0
their manure nourishes the vines , their milk makes the cheese and their meat ends up in @entity74 ’s big hands			0
later that evening , @entity74 was cranking up the volume and sharpening the knives			0
the coals in his inferno were white hot and @entity151 blasted out of the speakers			0
here in foodie heaven it was going to be a long and hellishly good night			0
@entity155 ( 0844 493 0787 ; www.ba.com ) flies to @entity13 from @entity156 from £ 86 return			0
double rooms at @entity16 ( www.villalebarone.com ) cost from € 195 a night .			0

the @entity161 - the @entity162 - is one of @entity5 *'s* less - known areas
small , *idyllic* villages such as @entity19 are the order of the day in the area
the town is also home to the butcher every celebrity chef has on speed dial
