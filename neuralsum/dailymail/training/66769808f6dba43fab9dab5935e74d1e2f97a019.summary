a joke at the expense of the mentally ill , however it was intended , is probably not the most politically correct thing for a police officer to post on @entity5			1
the non-pc pc ’s tweet included a photograph of an officer , said to be pc @entity10 , with ice cream splattered on his uniform			1
with the picture was the comment : ‘ warning do not get to [ sic ] close to people with mental health problems when they are eating ice cream			1
’ offensive : the tweet which appeared to poke fun at mentally ill was sent out from an account run by he police liaison officers with @entity24 on bank holiday monday one said : ‘ wow , this is ill - judged at the very least ! i ca n’t get over it			1
i ’m quite angry in fact			2
’ another commented : ‘ that ’s absolutely abhorrent			2
i ’d do more than smash an ice cream into the tw * t ’s chest			1
’ another reacted : ‘ i ’m actually appalled			2
the more i read it , the more i ca n’t believe how ignorant they can be ! ’ and @entity39 said : ‘ yeah , and of course @entity40 , @entity41 are known for throwing ice cream at people			1
’ yesterday @entity45 and @entity46 would not confirm what had actually happened ahead of the officer been covered in ice cream and whether or not he had actually engaged with someone suffering from mental health issues			1
appalling : @entity53 and @entity54 police 's chief constable apologised for the offensive tweet of pc @entity10 ( pictured ) but chief constable @entity57 responded to the original tweet posted on @ @entity59 , saying : ‘ it was very unwise indeed and will be deleted and apologised for as soon as the account holder responds to my [ direct message ]			1
’ he added of the incident : ‘ removal , contrition & education are precisely right			2
‘ just had a call from the control room : we ’re on it			0
” the @ @entity73 account is run by pc @entity74 who are the police liaison officers with @entity24			1

we ’ve now had removal			0
’ @entity85 is a serving officer with over 25 years ’ experience and a former merchant navy sailor			0
yesterday other @entity5 users urged mr @entity57 to punish the officer responsible			0

’ saying sorry : the @entity5 profile of @entity24 police liason officers pc @entity10 and @entity98 later had several apologetic tweets posted the tweet was yesterday removed from @entity5			1
the message on the @ @entity101 said : ‘ apologies this was not mean to offend sorry if it did it was n’t meant too [ sic ]			0
’ yesterday a second added : ‘ dear all , i now realise that my tweet of yesterday was totally inappropriate			2
i apologies again if it caused any offence			0
’ last month another officer from @entity45 was sacked for a @entity5 account criticising his force and comparing bosses to ‘ slime ’			0
@entity115 , 33 , sent more than 800 tweets from @ @entity117 - including labelling his officials ‘ @entity119 ’ ’			0
he always denied the @entity5 site was his - but his seniors matched his tweets with his duties and ruled it must have been his			0
he was dismissed for gross misconduct after a disciplinary panel decided on the ‘ balance of probability ’ he was the anonymous officer			0
investigators could not directly attribute the posts to him but decided they matched his ‘ intimate knowledge ’ .			0
