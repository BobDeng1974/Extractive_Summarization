by @entity1 reporter a frozen pink world , lurking in the far reaches of the solar system , has been nicknamed @entity5 after the @entity7 vice-president			1
the planet , which is seven and a half billion miles from the @entity9 , was found by astronomers searching an area of space beyond @entity13			1
although it wo n't officially be named for a while , dwarf plant ' 2012 @entity14 ' is being referred to as @entity17 , or @entity5 , by scientists as they continue their research			1
discovery : @entity14 , which has been nicknamed @entity5 , is in an area of space beyond @entity13 namesake : a newly discovered dwarf planet has been nicknamed @entity5 after the vice-president @entity5 is the second planet to be spotted in what had been considered a celestial wasteland			1
in 2003 astronomers tracked @entity29 , a planet named after a mythical @entity32 goddess			1
@entity34 's senior research scientist @entity33 , who was on the team that found the earlier planet , said the new discovery showed ' @entity29 is not a freak '			1
since @entity29 's discovery , astronomers have been looking for similar dwarf planets			1
their findings so far on @entity5 are detailed in the journal , nature			2
it was tracked using a new camera fitted to a ground telescope in @entity48 by @entity49 of the @entity50 for @entity51 in @entity52 , and @entity53 of @entity54 in @entity55			2
' it goes to show that there ’s something we do n't know about our @entity62 , and it ’s something important , ' @entity53 , who was part of the team that discovered @entity29 , told nature			2
' we ’re starting to get a taste of what ’s out beyond what we consider the edge			0
' @entity5 is about 280 miles across , and bitterly cold , with temperatures believed to be about minus @entity69			0
and , unlike @entity29 which is bigger , shinier and red , @entity5 is fainter and pink , making it hard to detect			2
in comparison , @entity73 is about 7,900 miles across and only 93 million miles from the @entity9 tracked : astronomers used a camera on a ground telescope to find @entity5 , pictured here in november 2012 @entity29 and @entity5 reside in an area known as the inner @entity81 cloud in the outer edge of the solar system , where some comets such as the @entity9 - diving @entity85 are thought to originate			1
@entity85 broke apart last year after brushing too close to the sun. ' finding @entity29 so far away seemed odd and potentially a fluke			0
but this one is beginning to make it look like that might be a typical place for objects to be			0
not at all what i would have guessed , ' @entity92 , an astronomer at the @entity93 , said			0
@entity92 , the self - proclaimed @entity13 killer , led the @entity29 team , but was not part of the new discovery			1
far from being deserted , @entity49 and @entity53 estimate there are probably thousands of similar objects in the inner @entity81 cloud			0
' these objects are not unique			0
there 's a huge number out there , ' @entity49 said			0
not all of them will be visible to telescopes because they are so far away , and it takes a long time for them to swing by the @entity9 @entity29 and vp @entity5 were spotted at their closest approach to the @entity9 , which allowed light from the @entity9 to hit the objects and bounce back to observatories on @entity73			0
exploration : an artist 's impression of @entity29 , which was discovered in the same region of space in 2003 @entity17 is currently the third farthest object in the solar system after dwarf planet @entity122 and @entity29 , but it has an eccentric , elongated orbit that can take it out to 42 billion miles from the @entity9 @entity29 can loop out as far as 84 billion miles from the @entity9 at its farthest point			1
now that @entity29 has company - and likely lots of it - scientists are searching for more objects in an effort to learn how they , and the solar system , formed and evolved			2
in a separate discovery published in @entity139 , a team led by @entity135 of the @entity136 in @entity137 found a pair of rings around an asteroid - like interloper in the outer system named @entity145			0
while not as dazzling as @entity148 's rings , it 's the first time rings have been discovered outside of the four gas giants - @entity151 , @entity148 , @entity152 and @entity153			0
how little @entity145 got its rings remains a mystery , but scientists think they may have formed from debris from a violent collision .			2

astronomers find faint pink , frozen world in region of space beyond @entity13
dwarf planet will be *renamed* when scientists know more about it
