' indeed we should not have any more of it from either police officers or former police officers - this kind of infantile discussion that goes on			1

' i think there is this continuing problem that there is an element within the @entity26 that has n’t understood the importance of policing needing to change and the @entity26 itself needing to change			0
' @entity163 has been a terrible advert for policing ; the behaviour of its members during the conferences , which has been often boorish even drunken ; the way in which they refuse to embrace any kind of discussion about the police service , has to do with a lot of the problems that it has confronted			2

the home secretary listed all of those			1
it ’s not representative , it ’s not diverse , there are very few women there , there are certainly almost no black and minority ethnic police officers there			1

' i am very pleased that finally the @entity26 did , yesterday , vote for change			0
it was opposed by the @entity207 , which was a quarter of all policing			0
so i am afraid there are elements which do n’t understand , that live in this @entity212 world of policing in a different age and i ’m afraid it ’s got to change			0
