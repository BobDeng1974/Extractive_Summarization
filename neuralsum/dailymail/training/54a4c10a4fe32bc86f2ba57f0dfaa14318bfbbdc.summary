by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor he has hopes of running the country in just 15 months			0
but @entity4 has been left off a list of @entity6 the 100 best - connected men in @entity6			0
to add insult to injury , his brother @entity8 and spin doctor @entity9 have both been included on the power list drawn up by @entity13			1
labour leader @entity4 has not been included on the @entity13 list of @entity6 's 100 best - connected men @entity4 's brother @entity8 , who lives in @entity17 , has been included on the list along with @entity20 's chief adviser @entity9 space has even been found for @entity20 ’s education spokesman , @entity22 , the tv historian who was only elected to the @entity23 in 2010			1
the list aims to identify men exercising influence by their networking not only in politics , but the media , business , sports , pr and culture			1
the top 100 are not ranked in order of importance , but politicians who make the cut include prime minister @entity39 and @entity41 mayor @entity40			1
in a thinly - veiled swipe at @entity4 , @entity13 editor @entity42 insisted ‘ connection is the new influence ’			0
his brother @entity8 , who he beat in the race to be @entity20 leader , does not even live in the @entity6			2
the former foreign secretary - currently living in the @entity50 as president of aid charity @entity52 - is listed for ‘ reinventing himself as a world - stage player ’ by ‘ schmoozing ’ with media moguls and bankers , while his brother ‘ struggles to reinvent @entity20 in time for the next election ’			0
mr @entity9 , mr @entity4 ’s senior advisor on @entity59 , is a former @entity60 journalist who is described by @entity13 as ‘ a cross between @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 ’ and ‘ a general go - to fixer for every problem facing the leader of the opposition ’			2
@entity39 , prince @entity68 and @entity40 all made the grade for the list big names from the media include @entity74 executive chairman @entity73 , @entity75 director general @entity73 and @entity77 presenter @entity73 - a former @entity13 interviewer - while sport is represented by the likes of @entity81 and @entity82 , art by potter @entity84 , tv host @entity85 and actors @entity86 and @entity88 , and pr by @entity89 , described as ‘ probably the best - connected man in @entity6 ’			2
the magazine identifies each of the men on the list as a ‘ connector ’ , ‘ influencer ’ , ‘ socialite ’ , ‘ leader ’ or ‘ spider ’ - the latter denoting people who ‘ operate in more than one sector ’			0
mr @entity39 , classed as a leader and a socialite , merits his place for ‘ forging against all the odds a coalition government ’ with @entity108 leader @entity108 - who does not make the list - but ‘ now has to get his own house in order and make the public case for a @entity115 victory ’ at the next election , said the magazine			2
meanwhile , the @entity118 is hailed as a leader , influencer and connector who is acting as ‘ a modest , but hugely influential deputy head of state , as the @entity123 , 87 , begins to scale down her responsibilities ’			0
the list was drawn up by @entity13 editor @entity42 ( right ) who last month collected an obe alongside artist @entity84 mr @entity42 , who once wrote a biography of mr @entity39 and last week collected an obe , said : ‘ the era of traditional , top - down power is over ; connection is the new influence and today 's achievers operate via a free - flowing exchange of ideas , using social media and personal networks to create value and understanding			1
‘ in recognition of this we decided to partner with @entity142 , the knowledge networking business , to co-curate a list bringing together those who embody the power of ideas today in a circle of connections rather than a top - down @entity151			0
‘ surely this is the first list to include both @entity68 and @entity154 side by side , as well as @entity4 's brother @entity8 and spin doctor @entity9 , but not the @entity119 himself			1

@entity13 list of top 100 men exercising influence by their networking
