by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 is well known for encouraging a possession - based style of play , but not many @entity7 fans would 've predicted his side would score after a 48 - pass move during his first @entity11 game at @entity12			1
unfortunately for former @entity7 boss and current @entity16 manager @entity14 , that 's exactly what happened when midfielder @entity18 finished off a fine passage of play with a powerful header past @entity22			2
the move began with defender @entity24 picking up the ball inside his own half and finding @entity18 out on the right by the halfway line			0
@entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 were all involved in the move before the ball found @entity57 in the centre of the pitch			0
the @entity60 skipped past the challenges of @entity62 and @entity63 before playing an inch - perfect cross into the area for the unmarked @entity66 to finish			0
it was the 25 - year - old 's second goal of the game and helped @entity3 's side record a convincing 4 - 0 win over new - boys @entity16 , with @entity72 and @entity53 also on target			1
every member of the @entity75 completed a pass in the build - up to @entity18 's second strike			0
here 's the top passers from one of the goals of the @entity11 season so far : @entity82 passes @entity24 – 10 @entity51 - 6 @entity44 – 4 @entity57 - 3 @entity52 – 3 @entity18 - 2 @entity72 - 2 @entity53 – 2 @entity54 - 1 @entity48 - 1 and here 's the whole move in all its glory - listed pass - by - pass @entity87 @entity88 @entity89 @entity90 @entity91 @entity92 @entity89 @entity87 @entity93 @entity89 @entity91 @entity94 - off @entity91 @entity87 @entity91 @entity87 @entity95 @entity87 @entity91 @entity89 @entity91 @entity87 @entity93 @entity91 @entity87 @entity95 @entity96 @entity91 @entity97 @entity91 @entity87 @entity97 @entity91 @entity87 @entity91 @entity93 @entity87 @entity93 @entity91 @entity93 @entity98 - off @entity91 @entity96 @entity97 @entity91 @entity92 @entity99 @entity96 @entity100 delighted : @entity66 ( left ) runs off to celebrate his second goal of the game with @entity53 ( right ) man of the moment : @entity18 scored twice as @entity3 's men ran riot against @entity14 's @entity16			1

@entity7 *thrashed* @entity16 4 - 0 at @entity12 on *sunday*
@entity18 's second goal of the game arrived after a 48 - pass move
