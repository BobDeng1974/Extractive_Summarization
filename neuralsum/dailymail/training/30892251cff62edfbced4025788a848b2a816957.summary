by @entity0 last updated at 4:30 pm on 30th november 2011 newsreader @entity1 proved a more - than - steady anchor for @entity4 last night when he calmly continued his live broadcast through a fire alarm			1
mr @entity1 barely batted an eyelid when a siren went off in the channel 's @entity10 studio in @entity13 moments into the @entity15 show			1
he had just started a report about @entity18 filing for bankruptcy when he was interrupted by a drone followed by an automated voice announcement			1
he calmly continues with his broadcast , but it was another 20 minutes at least until it was turned off but he maintained his composure , only once or twice flicking his eyes upwards , as he carried on with the segment			1
at one point , as the noise continued , he offered an easy chuckle and reassured viewers he was in no danger before reading on			2
he said : ' forgive us			2
we have a fire alarm announcement going on here in the studio			1
' very quickly , viewers began reacting on @entity43 , asking why someone could n't turn off the alarm quicker , while others praised mr @entity1 ' cool - headedness			2
@entity48 said : ' @entity1 is rewriting the definition of professionalism tonight			0
' mr @entity1 eventually handed over to his colleague @entity51 in the channel 's @entity53 office in the hope the now - high - pitched siren would be fixed in the meantime			1
just a slight twitch : mr @entity1 flicks his eyes upwards as the siren continues while he reads the latest on a story about @entity18 filing for bankruptcy time for a laugh : mr @entity1 jokes about the endless drone as he hands over to his colleague @entity51 in the @entity53 office but the alarm buzzed on , through the @entity70 story and through the lead - in to a story about the siege at the @entity74 in @entity75			0
mr @entity1 took a commercial break , but when he came back so did the alarm			0
each time , @entity1 kept his cool , reminding viewers everything was fine , even as his voice was again overwhelmed by the sound as he introduced a piece on @entity85 drug wars			0
finally , three - quarters of the way through the program , the alarm fell silent			0
as for the cause , @entity4 â€™s pr spokeswoman @entity89 tweeted an explanation : ' this is the first fire alarm in our new @entity15 studio			1
' system should have been shut off - but clearly still working out the kinks			0
' as he closed the program , mr @entity1 said : ' with thanks for your co-operation			0
we hope to get all quiet and see you here tomorrow night			0
