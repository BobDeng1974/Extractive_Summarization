@entity1 's dad can not recall when he was most in peril at sea			1
a 45 - year - old @entity6 trawlerman whose family have hauled fish out of the often treacherous waters around @entity10 for more than two centuries , @entity4 tries to put the risk inherent to his job out of his mind			1
‘ there ’ve been so many hairy moments it ’s hard to say which one was worst , ’ he said			2
‘ i knew men who ’ve been lost at sea			2
it ’s an awful feeling when you lose someone close to you			2
as a fisherman you try and put that to the back of your mind			2
if you thought about it all the time , you would n’t do it			2
’ it would be churlish to compare life as a professional rugby player with the day - to - day threats faced by fishermen , but it ’s clear bravery and a willingness to embrace risk has been passed from father to son			2
@entity41 wing @entity1 is an ambassador of the @entity42 in @entity6 when @entity43 was asked last week what it was about @entity1 he admired most , his response was unequivocal			1
‘ he ’s got the fearless courage to be thrown into a @entity52 arena and say “ give me the ball , i want the ball ” and make a difference , ’ said the @entity48 head coach			1
‘ it ’s what he brings to the team			0
he makes very few errors , has a kicking game , an ability to beat defenders and his defence is very , very good			0
he brings a no - fear mentality			2
’ the 21 - year - old scored a try in saturday 's 45 - 3 @entity68 victory over @entity69 the @entity41 wing hugs @entity48 team - mate @entity70 during last year 's @entity72 @entity73 is clearly a huge admirer of the 21 - year - old @entity76 chief who , under different circumstances , could easily have followed dad @entity4 into the family business			1
‘ i always joked with mum growing up saying “ i do n’t know what i ’m going to do after school , i ’m going out fishing with dad ” , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ she ’d say “ no , you are not , you ’ve got an education to fall back on ”			0
i ’d wind her up saying i was going to be a fisherman			0
‘ i never thought i ’d make it as a professional rugby player			0
all through school i did n’t know what i was going to do			0
it was n’t until i got to college that it really hit me that if i put my head down for two years i ’d have a contract waiting for me			2
' @entity1 trudges off with @entity48 team - mates after the @entity72 clash in @entity99 against @entity100 last february @entity101 player @entity1 onboard a @entity103 boat in the @entity104 in @entity6 with his father @entity1 ’s exceptional form this season since returning from an operation on his left knee — which caused him to miss last summer ’s tour to @entity111 after patella tendinitis had left him to ‘ play on one leg ’ for almost five years — saw him named in @entity73 ’s 34 - man @entity72 training squad			1
a strong showing in camp over the next fortnight will see him earn his sixth cap on the right wing against @entity121 in @entity122 in 12 days , when @entity48 open the @entity123 months after making his debut against @entity100 in @entity99 , and with a home @entity125 around the corner , @entity1 looks set for another stellar year			1
but it could all have been so different			0
far from the rough , tough , tattooed figure @entity1 cuts on the @entity10 harbour jetty as we talk — just yards from the family home he grew up in — the @entity133 admits he took time to embrace the sport he now loves			1
‘ i hated it to start with , ’ he said			0
‘ i was about six years old when mum first took me along to rugby training but i would n’t play			2
i ’d cling on her legs and refuse to go out			0
there were a lot of tears and tantrums			0
@entity1 in a school photo with his sister and two brothers whilst at the @entity146 , @entity6 , in 2008 ‘ eventually , after a couple of months i just went for it and have n’t really looked back			1
@entity149 used to bribe me by paying me a quid for every try i scored but he stopped when i scored 12 in one game against @entity153			0
he said “ you can play on your own now , son ”			0
’ a decade later @entity1 cut his teeth in one of @entity160 rugby ’s toughest arenas			1
‘ i think i was one of the youngest players to play for @entity153 ’s first team and i learned a lot there , ’ he said			0
‘ i was n’t happy just getting along so i really went for it			0
there was a guy called @entity168 who was a well - known @entity153 player who ’d been there for years and years			1
he ’s a small guy but a hard guy			0
@entity1 poses for the @entity171 onboard a @entity103 boat just out from @entity104 in @entity6 @entity1 ( @entity174 row , second from the left ) celebrates with team mates after winning a game as a junior ‘ in my first training session we were playing touch rugby and he obviously thought “ there ’s this new kid , i ’m going to give him a whack ”			1
i remember i caught the ball and he absolutely smoked me			0
it was a high , late and tip - tackle all in one			2
it was known as a @entity168 tackle			0
‘ i thought “ @entity192 , ok , this is men ’s rugby ” and got up and played on			0
people took notice of that because i ’d just dusted myself down and come back for more			0
’ precisely the same mental and physical toughness w as on show on debut in @entity99 last year , when @entity1 ’s spilled kick - off led to a try for @entity100 winger @entity202 inside two minutes			1
it could have crushed a lesser man but @entity1 shrugged off the mistake and set about repairing the damage to finish the match comfortably in credit , despite a narrow defeat that ultimately cost @entity48 a first @entity72 championship under @entity73			1
@entity1 in action for @entity48 ( left ) and back at six - years - old before his first ever rugby match ( right ) ‘ the coaches said the reason i got picked after that was because i did n’t allow that one mistake to affect me , ’ said @entity1			1
the last time @entity48 were in @entity122 they suffered a humiliating 30 - 3 defeat in what was the first serious blow to @entity73 ’s reign			1
when the @entity48 coach sits down to pick his team , he ’ll be looking for players who embrace the big stage and @entity1 has shown time and again — notably in @entity76 ’s @entity226 defeat by @entity231 ’s star - studded @entity229 side last season — that he fears no - one			1
@entity1 's mother @entity232 and her son @entity233 aged 11 , at their family home in @entity10 , @entity6 @entity1 puts on all the right gear for photos as an ambassador of the @entity42 in @entity6 @entity1 was playing for @entity48 under 20s when @entity43 ’s men were mauled in @entity122 but the youngster believes he ’s gained enough rugby experience to handle the heat			1
‘ i was chucked into a @entity246 game for @entity76 when i was 19 and if i ’d gone in being afraid then i might not have got picked again			2
it was the same in the @entity72 last year but @entity43 backed me			1
’ whatever happens now , this son of @entity10 will return home to @entity6 with his feet on the ground			0
as an ambassador of the @entity42 — who lost eight men on a rescue one grim night in december 1981 — @entity1 and his dad have grown up recognising real bravery when they see it			1
