@entity0 had just purchased his @entity1 from @entity2 when a wave of regret washed over him like @entity5 drowning a bowl of fettuccine			1
' i started wondering if i had made a mistake because i did n't know how i was going to eat enough pasta to justify buying the $ 100 pass , ' according to the @entity13 man			2
that 's when he hit upon the idea for seven weeks of @entity17 , where he would use his unlimited supply of @entity2 to give away free dinners throughout @entity21			1
@entity2 tweeted saturday , denying any involvement with @entity29 's video			1
' to set things straight â€” our only role was selling @entity40 & fulfilling his orders , ' the company stated to several users from its @entity45 account			0
according to the site documenting @entity29 's efforts , the first recipient was his sister , @entity46 , who was gifted a fettuccine alfredo with salad and breadsticks			2
from there , he says he dropped off dinners to friends , chased down his mailman and two @entity58 men with pasta , and treated a couple named @entity61 and @entity62 to a meal			0
when he showed up to his niece 's first birthday pasta in hand , @entity29 says his sister ' decided that it was tacky that i brought @entity2 to the party and so she hid it under the table			1
' @entity71 ( hair ) : @entity29 dropped off dinners to friends , chased down his mailman and two @entity58 men with pasta , and treated a couple named @entity61 and @entity62 to a meal unlimited pasta : @entity29 unwrapped his pasta pass and waited for the opportunity to start surprising people with free meals denial : @entity2 tried to come to the defense of a disheartened tribe , who had been accused on sites like @entity90 of being a corporate carbo shill @entity29 - who admits he ate 14 meals himself , sometimes after not finding anyone to deliver them to - says he delivered ten of the 100 meals from @entity17 to homeless residents in @entity21			1
he said he was touched when one woman said she was planning on sharing her meal with friends and went on a pasta run to bring them more meals			2
on his last day , @entity29 committed to seeing how many @entity105 he could visit in a single night , which brought him to five locations for seven meals			0
after that , he passed off the responsibility of the @entity111 to his sister , who gave out an extra 25 meals during the last two weeks			0
in the end , @entity29 says , the best @entity2 was in @entity115 , while the worst was a location in downtown @entity21 , where he was ided for his meal and watched a manager yell at the staff			1
still he calls his act of carbo benevolence ' one of the most fun and fulfilling things i 've ever done			0
' ' perhaps it 's because i live a very boring and uneventful life and doing anything is be better than the alternative , or perhaps it 's because that during the time i was doing @entity17 , the only thing on my mind was who i was going to take pasta to			0

@entity0 of @entity13 , @entity138 , purchased one of @entity2 's 1000 never ending pasta passes in *september*
the pass entitles the *cardholder* to unlimited pasta when dining at a restaurant or one free @entity147 meal
@entity29 got 100 meals from @entity2 , *distributing* most to family , friends , mailmen and homeless residents of @entity21
on @entity45 , @entity2 denied involvement with the stunt , beyond providing the pasta , but has tweeted in support of @entity29
