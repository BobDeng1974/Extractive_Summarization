by @entity0 a four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in @entity4 in the early 1970s , fracturing the community chimpanzees are often photographed huddled in groups grooming each other and relaxing in trees , but they are also capable of usurping dominant males in vicious power struggles and waging wars that last for years			1
a brutal four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in @entity16 , @entity4 in the early 1970s , fracturing the community and leaving some members dead			1
now scientists have taken a fresh look at the chimp conflict , which was recorded by primatologist @entity22 to reveal similarities in how chimpanzee and human societies break down			2
@entity22 witnessed the violent and sustained fighting of the apes first hand and called it a war			1
she had set up a feeding station at @entity16 to try and unravel why the conflict escalated from what was a harmonious group			1
@entity33 of @entity34 , @entity35 , has examined her field notes to build an in - depth model of the chimpanzee ’s social network			1
dame @entity22 made incredibly detailed notes detailing which apes arrived at the feeding station at the same time and from which direction they travelled , @entity45 reported			1
previously , scientists had estimated the strength of relationships between the amount of time two chimps spent together , but now dr @entity33 ’s team has entered @entity22 ’s data collected between 1968 and 1972 into a model to track how the group ’s relationship changed			2
scientists have taken a fresh look at the chimp conflict , which was recorded by primatologist @entity22 to reveal similarities in how chimpanzee and human societies break down it suggests that the group was one happy family until 1971 , until they divided into two groups			2
while they are not completely sure what sparked the conflict , an alpha male known as @entity70 died at the close of 1970			2
dr @entity33 told a meeting of the @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 : ‘ as soon as @entity70 died they started splitting			0
he seems to have been a bridge between the northern and southern chimps			0
a younger chimp called @entity80 stepped into the power vacuum but he was challenged by two apes from the southern group called @entity84 and @entity85			1
the study suggests that the group ( stock image used ) was one happy family until 1971 , until they divided into two groups			0
while they are not completely sure what sparked the conflict , an alpha male known as @entity70 died at the close of 1970 the apes followed wither @entity80 or the southern brothers and a four year battle began , resulting in the deaths of seven males from the brother ’s ‘ rebel ’ group			1
while chimpanzees are known for their caring group dynamics , groups of @entity80 ’s ‘ army ’ would sneak behind rebel lines , pick a target and beat him up			1
dr @entity33 discovered that it was possible to predict whether the chimp would support @entity80 or become a rebel and that the situation witnessed in the jungle resembles a power struggle in human society			1
he thinks that groups of chimpanzees might explain how human - like societies evolve			2
they have long been held as an almost human - like relative			0
but researchers have discovered chimpanzees have almost the same personality traits as humans			0
@entity123 research shows some of those traits have a neurobiological basis , and that those traits vary according to the biological sex of the individual chimpanzee			0
they found the most fundamental personality trait for chimpanzees is dominance – that is , whether an animal is a generally dominant and undercontrolled ' @entity134 , ' or a more playful and sociable ' beta			0
' but those two categories can be broken down statistically into smaller personality traits in ways that echo the personality structures researchers have found in child and adult human subjects			0
alpha personalities , for example , statistically break down into tendencies toward dominance and disinhibition			0
beta personalities , on the other hand , show low dominance and positive @entity152 analysis shows these lower order traits also can be statistically broken down into their constituent @entity155 research team identified five personality factors that combine differently in each individual chimpanzee : conscientiousness , dominance , extraversion , agreeableness and intellect .			0

**experts** from @entity34 , @entity35 examined field notes of @entity22 to unravel why the fighting began
they think the death of alpha male ' leakey ' created a power vacuum that was filled by a *weaker* male creating a group of rebels
fighting resulted in deaths of seven males from the brother ’s ‘ rebel ’ group
**experts** could predict apes ' *allegiances* and the power struggle resembled one in human society
