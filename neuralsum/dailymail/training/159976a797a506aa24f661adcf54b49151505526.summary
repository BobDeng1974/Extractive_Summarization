by @entity0 published : 21:02 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 02:53 est , 19 july 2013 @entity2 parents have opened up about their fears for their remaining son , saying that while they still have faith in the justice system , they are now more afraid about what they should tell @entity2 's older brother			1
' i 'm very afraid right now because i have no clue what to tell him			2
i have no clue if i should tell him to run or walk , i have no clue if i should tell him to defend himself or just lay there , ' @entity13 said of her son @entity18			0
the outrage about the not guilty verdict acquitting @entity21 of murdering @entity2 has not simmered , and as the grieving parents were interviewed about their reaction to the news , and how they decided to skip that final day of the trial			1

i have no clue if i should tell him to run or walk , i have no clue if i should tell him to defend himself or just lay there , ' @entity13 said of her son @entity18			0
opening up : thursday was the first time that @entity2 's parents talked about the trial , making a number of television appearances ms @entity13 , @entity2 's father @entity38 and their attorney @entity39 all appeared on @entity42 's show thursday night to talk about how they chose not to be in the courtroom when the verdict was read because they assumed they would have an outburst , which is strictly against the court rules			1
' either way , how could you be quiet ? how could you not show any emotions ? ' ms @entity13 said			0
instead , they watched the verdict come on television , and she said that not being in the room - knowing that no one was there to see their reaction - ' took the sting out ' but it did n't stop the pain			0
' it literally broke us down , ' she said			0
' i just thought the human side of them would say " listen , this was a kid , this guy made a mistake			2
" this was n't a burglar or just for him to suggest that he was a burglar or in any means that he was committing a crime , it ’s just not true			0
it 's just absolutely not true , ' ms @entity13 said			2
@entity76 : @entity77 joined his mother and @entity2 's father when they were interviewed by @entity81 earlier on thursday as the first in their string of post-trial appearances the two parents remained composed in tonight 's interview , just as they have in a number of other discussions today			1
even during the lengthy trial , they sat in the courtroom without breaking for the vast majority of the hearings			0
the only exception came when pictures of their slain son , or testimony about the brusining on his body , was shown to the courtroom as it proved too much for ms @entity13 to bare			0
a mother 's heartache : ms @entity13 said that her faith has helped her through the killing ' those things were more hurtful to me , and sometimes i could sit through it and sometimes i had to just go and sit by myself and say a prayer and ask @entity109 to send strength to me , ' she said			2
one thing that helped was their decision to never interact with @entity21 or his relatives in the courtroom			0
' we refrained from even looking his way			0
we did n't want our emotions to run high ... because we knew that our son ’s legacy was running in our hands , ' she said			0
' we needed to be in the courtroom to let them see that we were @entity2			1
' much has been made about @entity126 who has elected to come forward and talk about her rationale that led to the not guilty verdict			2
one complaint that came forth was that the jury - which was made up of five white women and one @entity133 woman - had an easier time empathizing with @entity21 than with the black teenager			1
@entity38 's parents said her interview with @entity42 just days ago made that painfully clear as she repeatedly used the words ' they ' and ' them ' to describe @entity141			1
' from the beginning of the trial , she had her mind made up			2
no doubt , ' mr @entity38 said			1
' when i heard the verdict , i kind of understand the disconnect : they did n't see @entity2 as their son			1
they did n't see @entity2 as a teenager			1
they did n't see trayvon as a human being who was just minding their own business , ' ms @entity13 said			0
pledge : @entity38 and @entity13 have started a foundation named after their son and say they hope his death and the trial can serve as a catalyst to bring the country together as a result of the trial , many @entity141 parents - including the @entity166 - have come forward about their confusion about what they should tell their children in regards to how to interact with strangers and the police			1
' by us living in a diverse community , we really do n't have to have the conversation where you have to be afraid of every different race because they grew up going to school with other nationalities , ' mr @entity38 said			1
' when you have a situation where an unarmed teenager is shot in the heart , what is it that i can tell my child now ? ' adding to the confusion is the fact that no meaningful change has yet taken place , and their lawyer pointed out that it sets a ' terrible ' precedent for future cases as anyone who comes out alive from a similar altercation has the upper hand in terms of crafting the narrative			0
picking sides : the juror who spoke out seemed to sympathize with @entity21 and understand his point of view more than the victim , @entity206 celebratory lunch : @entity21 defense lawyers @entity208 , left , and @entity210 enjoyed lunch at @entity211 on @entity212 with criminal lawyer and @entity215 analyst @entity214 , right inside the courtroom : the unidentified juror said that she felt @entity21 was justified in killing @entity206 because he felt threatened , even though she admits @entity21 may have ' enhanced ' the story the most telling sign that nothing has truly changed is the fact that @entity21 will now be given his gun back			0
' that 's troubling , ' mr @entity38 said			1
' that 's very troubling and it 's troubling because he made a statement on @entity227 if he had to do it all over again , he would n't change anything			2
' in spite of what legal analysts have suggested about the prosecution overreaching with the charge , both parents maintained that there was enough proof to convict the man who shot their son			2
' we thought there was enough evidence there no matter who was on that jury to convict him of second degree murder and when you think about it , i think they just took into account what @entity21 said was the truth , ' mr @entity38 said .			1
