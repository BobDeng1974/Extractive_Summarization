it has long been thought that stress can hinder a woman ’s chances of getting pregnant			2
but now science may have an answer to the problem			0
researchers discovered that cutting levels of a recently discovered hormone called @entity10 stopped stress from affecting pregnancy rates			1
the breakthrough offers hope of a drug that could switch off the effects of stress on the body			1
one in six couples today have trouble starting a family naturally so an effective treatment could have a huge impact			0
@entity10 is produced in the brains of all mammals and has the effect of switching off the reproductive system before puberty			1
scientists have found a hormone associated with stress , @entity10 , that affects the body 's ability to get pregnant , even after life returns to normal the hormone is thought to protect the body at times of stress – so it shuts down reproduction when it might be harmful for a woman to conceive			1
the team at the @entity42 , at first tested whether the hormone can also shut down reproduction later in life			1
they put female rats under psychological pressure for several hours a day for almost three weeks and then tried to mate them			0
the stressed - out creatures were less interested in mating and when they did get pregnant , they were more likely to miscarry than usual			0
as a result , their odds of giving birth plummeted to a quarter of the usual number			0
importantly , the effects of stress continued to be felt long after the animals ’ lives returned to normal			1
those given four days ’ recovery from stress – the equivalent of a month for a woman – had birth rates just as poor as creatures that were still highly stressed			2
crucially , their levels of @entity10 remained high			1
researcher @entity65 said : ‘ our study shows that the dramatic decrease of reproductive functions lingers well beyond the end of stress and beyond the time when we see high levels of stress hormones in the blood			1
‘ this can explain the high incidence and long - lasting effects of stress on human infertility			1
’ professor @entity65 then showed that reducing @entity10 stopped stress from affecting fertility			1
rats with low amounts of the hormone were just as likely to get pregnant as others , despite being stressed			0
the professor said : ‘ that was extremely surprising			0
it was the best - case scenario you could imagine			0
’ the study ’s lead author @entity91 said : ‘ a strikingly high proportion of healthy women struggle with fertility and our findings provide a new focus for the clinical study of human reproductive health			2
’ hopes are rising that there may a drug to cut levels of @entity10 and help stressed women more easily get pregnant the technique used to lower levels of @entity10 in the study may not be suitable for use in women			1
but scientists can now look for a drug that has the same effect			1
professor @entity65 , who is also a yoga instructor , acknowledges that it may well be questioned whether a stress - busting drug is appropriate , when a change in lifestyle can aid relaxation			2
but she said : ‘ it is not always as easy as that			0
‘ i can tell people to beat stress but it is not always feasible			2
’ professor @entity125 , medical director of the @entity126 in @entity127 , agreed that stress can affect fertility			2
she said : ‘ most women are multi-tasking and modern life is stressful			0
‘ this is an interesting study			0
if the results can be reproduced in humans , it could have positive implications in addressing stress - related infertility			2
’ but professor @entity139 , of the @entity140 at @entity141 , said that everyday stress has the potential to harm fertility only if worries become so overwhelming that a woman has trouble eating and sleep			0
the research was published in the journal @entity151 .			0

@entity10 protects body during stress but *prevents* pregnancy
@entity42 testing showed *miscarriages* more likely when levels high
scientists hope drug cutting @entity10 could end stress 's pregnancy effects
