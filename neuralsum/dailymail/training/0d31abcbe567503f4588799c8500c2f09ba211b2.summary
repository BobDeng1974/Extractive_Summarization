by @entity0 the rise of online computer games on social media sites could lead to a surge in childhood gambling problems , an expert has warned			1
they are introducing teenagers to the excitement and rewards of gambling even when they do not involve playing for money			2
games such as @entity14 - which can be played on @entity15 - have a ‘ moreishness quality ’ which hooks players in			1
addictive : @entity14 , pictured , can hook users in for hours at a time and lead to children becoming addicted , according to a report by @entity24 's @entity23 players of @entity14 win points by swiping rows of sweets until they line up three matching ones meanwhile many social media sites offer chances to play online poker with virtual money			1
cash gambling sites also offer free - play introductory games and because no real money is involved there are no age restrictions			2
the problem has been highlighted by @entity40 , director of the @entity23 at @entity24 , who is a world authority on gambling			1
he believes that teachers have a vital role to play in ensuring that children understand not only the potential rewards of gambling but also its risks			2
@entity49 : children are beating age restrictions on some games , the report said ( posed by model ) professor @entity40 wants to see gambling and gaming covered on the timetable during personal , social and health education ( @entity58 )			1
such lessons could explore the fact that there must always be more losers than winners			2
he told the @entity64 : ‘ one of the biggest predictors of whether people become gamblers is the playing of gambling - type games on free - play sites			2
‘ when you start winning , you start thinking that if i was playing with real money , i could be doing quite well			2
‘ children who play those free games are more likely to gamble and more likely to develop problem gambling behaviours			2
‘ these are gateway activities that can lead people down the gambling road			2
’ professor @entity40 insists there is a significant overlap between gambling and seemingly innocuous online games			0
many allow players to customise their avatars by spending money on virtual accessories or extra clothing			1
he said : ‘ it ’s a psychological masterstroke that people pay money to buy virtual items			0
the next step is for gambling firms to say , ‘ maybe you could win back some of the money you ’re spending ’			0
’ @entity14 gives players the option of paying money to access higher levels			1
it has been downloaded more than 500 million times			0
professor @entity40 said : ‘ it ’s a bit like the old drug - dealing analogy of giving a bit for free and hooking them in			0
‘ games like @entity14 have a moreishness quality , a bit like chocolate			0
you say you ’ll just have one chunk and you end up having the whole lot			0
‘ so you say , " i ’ll just play for 15 minutes " and you end up still there four or five hours later			1
’ writing for the @entity114 journal , professor @entity40 cites a 2011 study of more than 2,700 @entity117 secondary school students , which found that 15 per cent had played free gambling games during the week prior to the survey			1
one in ten said they had played free games on @entity15			0
controversy : @entity124 touted itself as the first game available through @entity15 on which players could win real money			1
it is only available to over- 18s but some bypass the limit , the report said cash : the game features cartoon characters similar to @entity135 alongside a traditional bingo board social gaming products such as @entity14 and @entity138 are created by third parties and not developed by @entity15			1
they are hosted on @entity15 and other social networking sites			0
@entity15 said it has tough controls in place to protect under - 18s and vulnerable people			0
this includes users undergoing checks on their identity , age and that they are located in the @entity117			0
the social networking site adheres to @entity117 rules to protect under age people from gambling products			0
it said that to all intents and purposes these sorts of services do not exist to people aged under 18 on @entity15			1
professor @entity40 highlighted concerns about @entity138 , available on @entity15 , which ‘ features cartoon characters similar to @entity135 ’ , in his paper , @entity163 : a @entity164			1
‘ having studied youth gambling and written two books , i do n’t believe gambling games should feature anything that might encourage children or adolescents to gamble , ’ he said			0
‘ although players have to be aged 18 years to play @entity138 , research has shown that adolescents regularly bypass the minimum age limits to have a @entity15 profile simply by giving false information and / or with the help of their parents			1
’ @entity179 , the company that makes @entity14 , told the @entity64 that its games were specifically targeted at adult women between the ages of 35 and 50 , although the age range of players was currently widening			1
the majority of people who complete @entity179 's games do n't pay			0
@entity189 , which encourages responsible gambling , said that two per cent of 11 to 15 - year - olds had trouble controlling their gambling behaviour			1
this is equivalent to 60,000 secondary school pupils in @entity117			0
a spokesman said : ‘ worryingly , those who begin their gambling careers earlier in life are more likely to be problem gamblers in adulthood			0

report also *criticised* @entity124 , which features cartoon characters
players are supposed to be over 18 but *younger* ones get around the limit
@entity24 expert : a ' 15 minute ' *session* can last five hours
