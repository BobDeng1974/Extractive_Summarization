men are all sex - driven , sports fans who rarely share their feelings , while women are neurotic , gossipers who love to shop			1
or at least , that what the prevailing gender stereotypes would have you believe			0
but a new @entity11 study suggests that in reality , men and women are more alike than most people realise			1
a new @entity11 study suggests that in reality , men and women are more alike than most people realise			1
the presumed divide , claim scientists , is caused by a tendency to focus on a few extreme differences rather than the many small similarities the presumed divide , claim scientists , is caused by a tendency to focus on a few extreme differences rather than the many small similarities			1
@entity26 came to this conclusion after analysing 100 personality characteristics reported in different studies that , in total , involved 12 million people			1
their study found an almost 80 per cent overlap between men and women for more than 75 per cent of the reported psychological characteristics analysed including risk taking , stress and morality			1
' this is important because it suggests that when it comes to most psychological attributes , we are relatively similar to one another as men and women , ' said @entity44 , an associate professor of psychology at @entity26			1
@entity26 found an almost 80 per cent overlap between men and women for more than 75 per cent of the reported psychological characteristics analysed including risk taking , stress and morality ' this was true regardless of whether we looked at cognitive domains , such as intelligence ; social personality domains , such as personality traits ; or at well - being , such as satisfaction with life			1
' the similarities were also consistent regardless of age and over time			2
it 's a scenario that has played out between men and women for centuries			1
a man thinks a woman wants sex after she smiles at him			0
she , meanwhile , interprets his advances as acts of friendship			0
now scientists say they have finally got to the bottom of why this happens - and it 's all to do with how male brains have evolved to pick up on the wrong signals			0
a man 's ability to reproduce is all about seizing every opportunity			0
he has to spend both money and time on attracting women , which still may not lead to sex			0
but it costs even more to not try , because then he wo n't be able to reproduce at all			0
' but that 's not how it works for women , ' explained researcher @entity84 from the @entity85 ( @entity85 )			0
a woman can have sex with multiple men over a short period of time without producing any more children			0
so for men , it is a low - risk , potentially high - reward situation to have sex with women whenever the opportunity presents itself			1
on the other hand , the cost is potentially great for a woman if she thinks that a man is more sexually interested than she is			0
professor @entity102 said that across thousands of generations , women 's psychology has evolved to set the bar higher , which means they need much clearer signals than men before they consider sex			1
the researchers did , however , find some attributes in which there was a significant gap between men and women			1
for example , men were more aggressive and masculine , while women had a closer attachment to peers and were more sensitive to pain			1
overall results , they say , contradict what many people think			0
one reason , says professor @entity44 , is the difference in extremes			0
the evidence researchers aggregated focuses on a typical range of characteristics , but on the far end of the spectrum the differences are often exaggerated			1
' people tend to overestimate the differences because they notice the extremes , ' professor @entity44 said			2
he used aggression as one example			0
' if you look at incarceration rates to compare the aggressiveness of men and women , the fact that men constitute the vast majority of the prison population supports the idea that men are extremely more aggressive			2
' however , it 's a misleading estimate of how much typical men and women differ on aggressiveness , if that 's the only thing you look at for comparison , ' he said			2
people also notice multiple differences at the same , which can give the impression of a larger effect			2
' the difference on any one trait is pretty small , ' professor @entity44 said			0
' when there are several smaller differences , people might think there 's a big difference because the whole configuration has a different flavour			2
' professor @entity44 says some behavioural differences may be learned through social roles			0
although men may be said to come from @entity173 and women from @entity175 , these findings remind us that we all come from @entity177 after all , he added .			2

divide is caused by a tendency to focus on a few extreme differences
but men and women share many more small similarities , study finds
