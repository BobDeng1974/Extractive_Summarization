by @entity0 published : 12:00 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 13:34 est , 8 january 2014 a gambling addict who worked for @entity4 strangled his wife in a fit of rage on the day he was to attend a disciplinary meeting after losing the bank millions of pounds , a court heard			2
@entity11 , 35 , who worked as a product controller , feared he would be sacked after an accounting error cost the bank millions of pounds so asked wife @entity15 to accompany him for moral support , jurors were told			1
but on july 10 last year prosecutors claim he killed the 35 - year - old at their home in @entity20 , @entity21 , then tried to cover it up by saying she fell off a stool			1
she died in hospital two days later			2
' @entity27 ' : it is claimed @entity11 ( left ) strangled his wife , @entity15 ( right ) , in a fit of rage on the day of a meeting about his job			1
she had discovered her husband had blown thousands on gambling websites in the months leading up to her death @entity15 , who has a one - year - old daughter @entity42 with @entity11 , discovered her husband had been blowing thousands on gambling websites			1
he admitted he was £ 8,000 in debt and had been borrowing from friends and family to pay it off			1
then three days before she died , she noticed jewellery including four bangles , a chain and a gold coin , as well as £ 1,500 cash had gone missing			1
when @entity15 confronted her husband he denied taking it but became ‘ very aggressive and defensive , ’ it was said			2
the day before she was murdered @entity15 told a friend she was considering calling the police and had thought of leaving @entity11 , but wanted to keep the family together for the sake of their daughter			1
prosecutor @entity65 told @entity66 : ' at 1.17pm on 10 july 2013 , a call was made to the emergency services from their home address by the defendant			2
' he said he had found his wife unconscious on the bedroom floor and thought she had fallen off a stool and hit her head and did not appear to be breathing			2
' the emergency operator talked the defendant thought cpr techniques until paramedics arrived at 1.32pm			2
' she was lying on the floor next to a plastic stool and the defendant surmised she had fallen from it when standing on it to get something from the wardrobe and struck her head on the cot			2
' in police interview @entity11 claimed his wife suffered from blackouts which could have explained the fall			1
but those close to the victim said the only time she had ever fainted was when she missed a meal shortly after giving birth to her daughter			2
when paramedics arrived they spotted a red mark across @entity15 ’s neck ‘ like a ligature mark			2
’ @entity11 also had fresh scratches on his face			1
further injuries were discovered on @entity15 ’s body during a post-mortem two days later			2
these included bruising on her back , elbows and shoulders , consistent with being pinned against a wall or floor , deep bruising around her nose suggesting a hand had been put over her face , and her neck had been compressed so hard it had bruised her spine			2
mr @entity65 said : ' if @entity15 ’s death had been the result of an accidental fall , it was a remarkable coincidence that the defendant should have suffered fresh scratches to his face , consistent with @entity15 , as she was being strangled , flaying out and scratching her assailant			2
' moreover , if @entity15 had simply fallen from a stool , her timing was remarkable			0
' by coincidence she fell on the day that the defendant was due to attend an important meeting at work to address his future at @entity4 , where he had worked for five to six years , and was in difficulties both because he had been on long term sick from the previous january and because of a serious accounting error for which he was being held responsible			0
mr @entity11 feared he would lose his job at @entity4 but a court heard he may not have done ' there was a real risk he was about to lose his job and this impending disaster had been causing him considerable stress and anxiety			1
' by his own admission he was in debt to the sum of £ 8,000 as a result of his gambling and these debts had been a source of discord between himself and his wife			1
' and in the days preceding her death @entity15 had been complaining to friends and family about the defendant ’s debts and that items of jewellery and money had been going missing			1
' in short , the circumstances were ripe for the defendant to have lashed out in temper and to have compressed his wife ’s neck , causing her death			0
such timing , when put together with the pathological findings , point to @entity15 ’s death being murder			0
' @entity11 may not have lost his job , a court heard			1
in a statement @entity177 , a @entity178 manager at @entity4 , said problems began with @entity11 when he failed to turn up for work one day in january 2013			1
she said : ' a colleague made contact with his wife who said she thought he was at work			0
i later heard he had been travelling around on trains in @entity187 all day and had not got off to come to the office			0
' after that @entity11 , who earned £ 45,000 a year , was put on long term sick leave and referred to occupational health due to stress			1
the court heard during one of his meetings with a doctor @entity11 was annoyed because he found out a junior colleague was getting paid more than him			1
then in february 2013 an accounting error was spotted in his workload dating back to 2010			0
miss @entity177 said : ' it involved millions of dollars			0
there was no financial benefit to him but he had tried to cover it up			0
' she said she called @entity11 on the day of the meeting when he failed to arrive			1
' he answered the phone and he was crying			0
he said his wife was not breathing			0
i said " do n't worry about the meeting , be with your wife			0
" and he said " thank you @entity177			0
" the @entity178 manager added that ' no decision had been made ' as to @entity11 's future within the company at that point			1
prosecutors claim @entity11 killed her at their home in @entity20 , @entity21 , then tried to cover it up @entity66 heard @entity11 wed @entity15 in an arranged marriage in their native @entity222 in 2003			1
jurors heard @entity15 moved over first in 2005 to do a postgraduate degree in autism at @entity226 in @entity227 , and @entity11 followed in 2006			1
in late 2007 he secured a job at @entity4			0
a year later @entity15 got a job as an occupational therapist at @entity231 in @entity187 but @entity11 remained in @entity227 until he got a job transfer to the @entity4 in @entity233 in 2009			1
their daughter @entity42 was born in january 2012			0
but witnesses said @entity15 was unhappy in her marriage and even more so when she found out @entity11 had been borrowing money from friends and family to pay off his debts			1
her best friend @entity242 , who was ' like a sister to her ' told the court the couple 's relationship got worse after @entity247 was born			0
she said : ' she was very stressed in the relationship and she felt she had to look after the work situation , the house and the baby as well			0
then when she found out about the money that was another burden			0
' miss @entity242 also revealed the pair had not been sexually intimate for a while and often slept in separate beds			0
but on the morning of the alleged killing @entity11 claims the pair had sex			1
an empty condom wrapper was later discovered in their bedroom			0
@entity15 's mother @entity262 , who gave evidence via videolink from @entity265 , said a month before her daughter died she went to stay with her as she felt she was in ' dire straits			0
' she broke down as she said : ' i 'm happy that i was there for her when she needed me but that was to be the last time i would be with her			0
' @entity11 called the family in tears on july 10 to tell them what had happened but claimed ' i did n't do anything , ' the court was told			1
the following day mrs @entity262 flew to @entity187 to be at her daughter 's bedside			0
she said : ' i was numb emotionally			0
my daughter was lying on her death bed and there was no hope			0
all i could think and pray was for a miracle to happen			0
' @entity11 denies murder and claims the scratches on his face came from his daughter who has long nails			1
