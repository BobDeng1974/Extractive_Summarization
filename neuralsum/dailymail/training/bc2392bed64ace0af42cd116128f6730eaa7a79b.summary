mr @entity0 declared : ' we will maintain the security of the @entity21 benefits system , with @entity21 benefit rates , underpinned by the pooling and sharing of resources across the @entity21			1
' but we will go further by ensuring that the final say on benefit levels remains in @entity3 by giving the @entity3 parliament a wider power to top up @entity21 benefits			1
' this will ensure that @entity3 is protected from @entity47 welfare cuts - there could never be another bedroom tax in @entity3 - and from benefit cuts caused by a fall in @entity3 funding due to , for example , the collapse in the oil price			2
' he argued @entity3 should be able to make ' different choices ' about the size of benefit payments			1
' we will go further by ensuring that the @entity3 parliament has the power to introduce new benefits , funded from @entity3 , to meet different circumstances and different choices we make in @entity3			1

@entity70 , leader of the @entity71 , said : ' @entity3 's economy is on the road to recovery with welfare changes meaning thousands more @entity3 are in work			2

' the speech in @entity15 today is part of a @entity1 fightback following polls that have indicated the @entity106 could win more than 50 seats in may			0
however , @entity106 deputy leader @entity134 hit out yesterday : ' this is absolutely farcical from @entity1			0
