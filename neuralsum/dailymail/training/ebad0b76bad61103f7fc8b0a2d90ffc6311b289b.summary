by @entity1 reporter published : 05:42 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 06:32 est , 2 october 2012 footage of a 13 - year - old dancing to @entity5 's @entity4 during his @entity7 party in 1992 became an internet sensation with more than a million hits after it was posted on @entity12 earlier this year			1
but far from being embarrassed about his internet fame , @entity13 appears to have spent time perfecting the dance routine and has recreated the viral ' @entity4 ' video to show off his latest moves			1
the original footage was taken from @entity13 's coming of age @entity7 party in a northwest suburb of @entity22 on march 14 , 1992			1
at the start of both videos , @entity13 takes to the dance floor wearing a smart suit jacket			1
but he soon whips it off to reveal @entity5 's face printed on the back of his white shirt			0
as he begins his dance , the spectators start whooping and clapping with encouragement - in both the 1992 and recent versions			0
icon : @entity4 had been released by @entity5 two years before @entity13 performed his version of her dance ' @entity4 ' at his @entity7 still a fan : @entity13 has perfected his moves but now has the help of some shiny backing dancers not that @entity13 needs any reassurance - in the five minute clip he confidently rolls out all the moves from her monochrome video			1
but in the slightly raunchier recnt video , @entity13 continues to strip down to a black vest top , much to the audience 's delight			0
@entity5 had released the chart - topping song in 1990 and clearly @entity13 used the time since to learn her famous moves			2
channeling his inner @entity5 : @entity13 strikes a pose @entity4 style strike a pose ! @entity13 and his backing dancers nail the ' @entity4 ' pose at one point in the original video he even gets on the floor , resting on one hand while he throws his head back			2
but he has one advantage in his remake of the clip - two glittery dancers to help support some of his moves			0
at the end of the original performance @entity13 walked over to the edge of the dance floor and retrieves his jacket - but not before he got a kiss from a proud lady in peach			2
showcasing his skill : the video has already been viewed by over 40,000 people since it was posted online earlier this week go with the flow : whatever his age , spectators appear to love @entity13 imitating @entity5 floor work : throughout the duration of the song whoops of encouragement can be heard from the spectators let your body go : @entity13 has added a few extra moves - and people - to the routine the theme of the @entity7 was evident to the guests from the start - the final shot shows a giant @entity5 poster above the @entity113 stand			1
and it seems his passion has n't faded overtime as he now regularly reperforms his @entity4 routine for cheering spectators			0
the original has now been viewed more than a million times but his latest version is quickly catching up - and already has more than 15,000 hits in less than a day			0
finished : at the end of the performance @entity13 walked over to the edge of the dancefloor and retrieved his jacket - but decided to remain in his tight black vest top in the newer version superfan : the theme of the @entity7 should have been obvious as this poster was on the wall above the dj now watch the video			0
