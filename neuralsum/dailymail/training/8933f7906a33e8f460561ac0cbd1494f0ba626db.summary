by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 20:40 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 20:27 est , 30 october 2013 warning : sir @entity2 , president of the @entity3 , said courts face ' enormous challenges ' in today 's society courts should not give @entity9 more weight than other religions , a senior judge has said			1
sir @entity2 , president of the @entity3 , said @entity12 was a ‘ multicultural community of many faiths ’ and that judges must take an ‘ essentially neutral view of religious beliefs ’ and not ‘ weigh one religion against another ’			1
in a speech in @entity21 , he said judges ‘ happily ’ no longer had a role in enforcing morality , unlike in the past when they routinely condemned homosexuality , adultery and promoted @entity28 social attitudes			0
‘ @entity30 , the perceived function of the judges was to promote virtue and discourage vice and immorality , ’ he said			0
‘ i doubt one would now hear that from the judicial bench			0
‘ today , surely , the judicial task is to assess matters by the standards of reasonable men and women in 2013 – not by the standards of their parents in 1970			0
’ sir @entity2 said that @entity28 judges promoted ‘ virtue and morality ’ while discouraging ‘ vice and immorality ’ with a ‘ very narrow view of sexual morality ’			1
he cited laws banning gay sex and abortion and rulings that condemned women for adultery			0
he added that the influence of @entity9 churches in the courts had also disappeared in recent years			0
he said : ‘ happily for us , the days are past when the business of judges was the enforcement of morals or religious beliefs			1
’ he said that modern - day judges had rightly abandoned any claim to be ‘ guardians of public morality ’ , just as @entity9 clerics no longer claimed to speak as the ‘ defining voices of morality and of the law of marriage and the family ’			0
sir @entity2 said the last few years had seen the ‘ disappearance , in an increasingly secular and pluralistic society , of what until comparatively recently was in large measure a commonly accepted package of moral , ethical and religious values ’			1
‘ today , we live in a largely secular society which , insofar as it remains religious at all , is now increasingly diverse in religious affiliation , ’ he said			2
‘ although , historically , this country is part of the @entity87 and although it has an established church which is @entity9 , we sit as secular judges serving a multi-cultural community of many faiths , sworn to do justice “ to all manner of people ”			1
controversy : former archbishop of @entity98 dr @entity97 sparked a religious row in 2008 over his comments about @entity102 law ‘ we live in this country in a democratic and pluralistic society , in a secular state not a theocracy , ’ sir @entity2 said in a keynote address to the first annual conference of the @entity106 ’s family law section in @entity21 on tuesday			1
in his speech , called ‘ @entity113 in the @entity114 ’ , he said courts no longer recognised any religious distinctions and ‘ generally , passed no judgment on religious beliefs or on the tenets , doctrines or rules of any particular section of society ’			2
‘ all are entitled to respect , so long as they are “ legally and socially acceptable ” and not “ immoral or socially obnoxious ” or “ pernicious ” , ’ he said			0
however , sir @entity2 did point to elements of religious practice which he said were ‘ beyond the pale ’ , including forced marriage , female genital mutilation and so - called ‘ honour - based ’ domestic violence			1
he also said courts would overrule parents ’ religious beliefs if it was in their child ’s best interests , such as if a child of @entity138 needed a blood transfusion			2
‘ we live in a largely secular society which , insofar as it remains religious at all , is now increasingly diverse in religious affiliation , ’ he added			0
he said a believer ’s faith was not the ‘ business of government or of the secular courts ’ , ‘ although , of course , the courts will pay every respect to the individual ’s or family ’s religious principles ' .			2

sir @entity2 : judges should **n't** ' weigh one religion against another '
he *insists* they sit as ' secular judges serving a multicultural community '
says peoples ' religious beliefs are **n't** the business of the secular court
