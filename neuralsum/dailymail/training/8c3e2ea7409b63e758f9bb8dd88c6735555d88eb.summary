by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 19 april 2012 updated : 19:42 est , 19 april 2012 a young couple who were in effect tried and cleared twice of shaking their baby son to death called last night for an inquiry into their ‘ agonising ’ treatment at the hands of social services , the @entity11 and the police			1
@entity13 and @entity14 were accused of killing four - month - old @entity15 , who died of severe head injuries			1
while awaiting trial , they lost custody of the little boy ’s younger sister , @entity20			0
they were cleared of all criminal charges when it emerged their son had been suffering from rickets which causes weak bones and could explain his injuries			1
success : @entity14 and @entity13 ( pictured ) have won a @entity32 battle to prove their innocence over the death of their baby son charges of murder and causing or allowing @entity15 's ( pictured ) death were dropped following a six - week trial however , their local council refused to return @entity20 to her parents because it remained convinced they may have been responsible for her brother ’s death			1
the couple then endured a four - week hearing at the @entity32 during which the same accusations were levelled at them			1
yesterday , in a landmark judgment , they were cleared for a second time , and later they spoke bitterly of their treatment			1
mr @entity13 , 22 , said : ‘ there are medical staff who we believe should be disciplined at an inquiry			0
i think these medical experts who judge parents are dangerous people			2
they base much of what they say on opinion rather than fact			0
’ his partner @entity67 , 19 , added : ‘ the doctors and the police made allegations against us without any real proof , then they acted on these allegations			2
’ their nightmare began in july 2009 when @entity15 , their first child , began suffering seizures and refusing to feed			1
doctors failed to identify that he had rickets and his condition continued to deteriorate			0
he died at @entity79 in @entity80			0
after he was found to have multiple fractures and severe brain damage , his parents , from @entity84 , @entity80 , were charged with murder and causing or allowing @entity15 ’s death			1
@entity20 was born in october 2010 and was immediately taken from the couple			0
in december 2011 an @entity89 judge ordered not guilty verdicts to be returned because there was insufficient evidence to convict after more than 60 prosecution and defence medical experts had failed to agree on a cause of death			1
the court heard that @entity67 suffered from a severe vitamin d deficiency that would have been passed to @entity15 , causing injuries that led to his death			1
' a very much wanted baby ' : @entity14 cuddles @entity15 when he was two months old but @entity103 remained concerned for @entity20 ’s safety and , because the couple had not been acquitted by a jury , chose to stage in effect a re-run of the criminal case			1
handing down her judgment yesterday , mrs @entity110 paid tribute to @entity15 ’s parents , saying : ‘ despite the parents ’ youth and the fact the pregnancy was unplanned , @entity15 was very much a wanted baby			1
’ sitting at the @entity32 ’s family division in @entity80 , she said the case against the pair was not proved and called for more research into vitamin d deficiency and its effects on young children			1
she said : ‘ the issues surrounding vitamin d deficiency have dominated this hearing			0
‘ evidence has been given that it is on the increase , leading possibly to an increase in congenital rickets			0
‘ the identification of it is not easily done , as this case so graphically demonstrated			0
’ the disease , which was discovered at @entity15 ’s post mortem , weakens the skulls of children and causes their bones to break easily – symptoms which closely mimic those of a deliberately shaken baby			1
mr @entity13 said : ‘ we feel we were treated very poorly by the state authorities involved in investigating our case			0
we were viewed as guilty from the outset			0
‘ they went down the line that we had done this to our son by shaking him			0
‘ if the doctors had found the rickets problem , we feel our son could still be alive today			2
but our agony at losing @entity15 was exacerbated when we were accused of killing him			1
’ police refused to let the couple or their family attend @entity15 ’s christening , which they requested before his life support machine was switched off			1
victory after agony : @entity13 and @entity14 pose after their @entity32 victory they were not allowed into the paediatric intensive care ward to see him when he died			2
but the parents said the most heartbreaking moment of their ordeal was when their newborn daughter was taken from them			2
mr @entity13 said : ‘ since the @entity172 social workers , the police and doctors have become over-keen to snatch children from innocent parents			0
‘ we feel that they should look more closely at the facts of each case before pointing the finger of blame			0
’ @entity180 of law firm @entity181 , representing @entity67 , said : ‘ nothing is as sad as the death of a child			2
‘ but for these parents , the nightmare went on and on			0
‘ it was compounded by the criminal investigation and then the loss of their daughter without being able to bond with her			2
‘ they are delighted and relieved that they can finally be allowed to grieve for their son and be reunited with their daughter			2
’ @entity103 declined to comment .			0

they first *walked* free in december last year after being cleared of killing four - month - old @entity15
later faced allegations over the death in the civil family courts from local authority
yesterday a judge found the allegations had *n't* been proved
they will now have their daughter returned to their care
