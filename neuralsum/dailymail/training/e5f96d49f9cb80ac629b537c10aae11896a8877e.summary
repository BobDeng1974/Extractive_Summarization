from its largest volcano to its deepest canyon , the extreme terrain of @entity1 can now be explored in unprecedented detail from the comfort of your desk			0
taking 16 years to create , this colourful map describes the geography of @entity1 as it is today while also shedding light on the red planet ’s watery past			1
it also reveals that much of the planet ’s surface is older than scientists thought , with the darkest brown areas on the map formed more than four billion years ago			1

' spacecraft exploration of @entity1 over the past couple decades has greatly improved our understanding of what geologic materials , events and processes shaped its surface , ' said @entity23 scientist and lead author , dr @entity38			2
' the new geologic map brings this research together into a holistic context that helps to illuminate key relationships in space and time , providing information to generate and test new hypotheses			0
' this new global geologic map of @entity1 depicts the most thorough representation of the red planet 's surface			2
the map reveals that much of the planet ’s surface is older than scientists thought , with the darkest brown areas on the right and left map formed more than four billion years ago most of the surface area of the map dates to the first major geologic time period - the @entity62 - than was previously mapped			1
this timeframe is the earliest part of the @entity65 , which ranges from about 4.1 to about 3.7 billion years ago , and was characterised by high rates of meteorite impacts , widespread erosion of the @entity1 surface and the likely presence of abundant surface water			1
the map also confirms previous work that suggests @entity1 had been geologically active until the present day			0
there is evidence that major changes in @entity1 ’ global climate supported the temporary presence of surface water and near - surface groundwater and ice			0
these changes were likely responsible for many of the major shifts in the environments where @entity1 rocks were formed and subsequently eroded			0
low lying deposits , mostly 7,000 metres to 3,000 m beneath the surface are shown in green while impact craters are marked by the yellow areas doted around the planet lava flows and volcanos on the red planet are shown in red , purple and orange depending on when they were formed and the type of feature described			1
@entity101 areas , generally about 3,000 metres above the surface elevation , are highlighted in grey and brown evidence of water on @entity1 dates back to the @entity107 mission , which arrived in 1971			1
it revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons			0
@entity114 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in ideas about water on @entity1 by showing how floods carved deep valleys			0
@entity1 is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface at the present time			0
however , the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past			0
in june last year , @entity127 found @entity129 evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity1			0
in september , the first scoop of soil analysed by @entity127 revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight			0
the light blue areas show the late @entity140 polar caps			0
these areas are heavily pitted by impact craters , particularly in the southern polar region			2
lava flows and volcanos on the red planet are shown in red , purple and orange depending on when they were formed and the type of feature described			1
low lying deposits , mostly 7,000 metres to 3,000 metres beneath the surface are shown in green while impact craters are marked by the yellow areas dotted around the planet			1
@entity101 areas , generally about 3,000 metres above the surface elevation , are highlighted in grey and brown			1
a full explanation of the features can be found here			0
' findings from the map will enable researchers to evaluate potential landing sites for future @entity1 missions that may contribute to further understanding of the planet ’s history , ' said @entity23 acting director @entity172			1
' the new @entity1 global geologic map will provide geologic context for regional and local scientific investigations for many years to come			2
' the @entity1 surface has been the subject of scientific observation since the 1600s , first by @entity180 - based telescopes , and later by fly - by missions and orbiting spacecraft			1
the @entity107 and @entity114 missions produced the first planet - wide views of @entity1 ’ surface , enabling publication of the first global @entity1 geologic maps in 1978 and 1986 - 87			2
this latest map was created using data from the @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity195 spacecraft			2
there is evidence that major changes in @entity1 ’ global climate supported the temporary presence of surface water and near - surface groundwater and ice			0
these changes were likely responsible for many of the major shifts in the environments where @entity1 rocks were formed and subsequently , as shown by features in this map			2

much of planet ’s surface is older than thought , with the dark brown areas formed more than *4billion* years ago
lava flows and volcanoes on @entity1 are shown in red , purple and orange depending on type of feature described
low lying deposits are shown in green while impact craters are marked by the yellow areas dotted on the map
highland areas , generally about *3km* above the surface elevation , are highlighted in grey and brown
