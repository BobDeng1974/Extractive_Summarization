@entity0 certainly wo n't be short of exciting attacking options as he plots the downfall of champions @entity3 on saturday			1
there have been a few injury concerns over the international break , with @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 picking up knocks			1
but it appears @entity0 will have a clean bill of health and all his @entity14 back firing in the top - of - the - table clash at the @entity16			0
luckily for the @entity47 , the back line pretty much picks itself at the minute			0
@entity48 will have @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity36 in front of him			0
@entity52 is set to return at left - back in place of @entity55 if the @entity56 can prove he 's recovered fully from a hamstring injury			0
all five will have to be at their best to repel @entity3 's free - flowing front line and @entity0 would be wise to deploy either captain @entity8 or @entity7 directly in front of them			1
@entity8 is back in full training following his ankle injury and is likely to come back in , but some question marks remain over @entity7 after he rolled his ankle on @entity67 duty			1
in keeping with the system utilised this season , the midfield then fans out with @entity34 on one side and @entity73 on the other			2
with @entity23 set to take up his position as the target man , @entity75 will drop back to the right side			2
@entity9 should be available after returning early from international duty with a sprained ankle and will feature on the left			0
the dilemma for @entity0 is that this line - up omits the likes of @entity85 and @entity86 - emphasising the strong options he has at his disposal			1
sitting role : @entity90 forward @entity75 ( front ) takes a breather while @entity73 watches on foot race : @entity55 ( left ) and @entity85 battle for the ball in training captain @entity8 has returned to full training following his ankle injury and is line to start @entity20 's @entity56 core of ( from left ) @entity23 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity34 at training on friday @entity9 shares a joke with @entity105 as @entity20 gather for their team photograph on friday @entity107 coy over nature of @entity23 's arrival @entity9 will be the one to make way if @entity0 feels @entity3 will be rattled by the pace of @entity85			1
@entity0 needs to be wary of being too gung - ho against @entity3 - they will pick @entity20 off if given the chance - but they need to make some kind of statement that they are not cowed by these big games			2
@entity20 have collected just 26 points from a possible 90 against top four opponents over the last five seasons - an awful record that has prevented them sustaining a title challenge			0
now , however , there should be optimism around the @entity16 that @entity20 have the personnel to do just that			0
@entity126 has called for @entity8 and @entity9 to be kept out of @entity20 's team for the visit of @entity3			1
writing in his @entity130 column , @entity126 says @entity9 was a ' passenger ' for much of @entity20 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity132 prior to the international break			0
he also believes @entity134 and @entity7 should play in place of @entity8 , despite the captain 's return to fitness .			2

@entity0 has plenty of attacking options at his disposal for the visit of @entity3 on saturday
his front line will be *rearranged* to accommodate Â£ 16m @entity23
@entity75 and @entity9 could provide the *ammunition*
@entity34 , @entity73 and @entity8 will try and win midfield battle
the pace of @entity85 is another option
@entity52 and @entity7 should be fit after injury *niggles*
