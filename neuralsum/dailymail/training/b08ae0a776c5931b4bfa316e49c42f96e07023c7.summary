the logo of the @entity1 which has compiled a list of 98 clients which has been handed to the @entity4 @entity7 companies who are linked to rogue private investigators will face a new inquiry , the data protection watchdog announced last night			1
the @entity4 launched a probe after it was belatedly handed by the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) a list of 98 companies and individuals who are connected to the private eyes			1
it represents a major development in the so - called blue - chip hacking scandal – after months of criticism by mps that nothing was being done			0
@entity1 , which has come under huge pressure over its failure to investigate the firms , finally succumbed to public pressure and handed the list over at the end of last week			1
the @entity4 will now write to the celebrities , law firms , banks and other prominent companies on the list and quiz them about what they knew about the activities of the investigators			1
it will examine at least 20 files of material to see if any were aware that private investigators had been instructed and whether they knew that the four private eyes who were jailed last year after a police probe were breaking the law			0
however , the @entity4 admitted that up to a quarter of the firms allegedly involved may have been based outside the @entity45 , raising fears many could escape prosecution			2
the @entity4 insisted it could push for investigations by its counterparts in other countries			2
@entity1 has for months refused to hand over the list to the @entity4 on the grounds that it could damage an ongoing police investigation			1
but in the end , it withheld only nine names which are the subject of a separate @entity58 probe , @entity59 , which is looking at computer hacking			0
the blue chip hacking list was drawn up during a @entity1 inquiry , @entity62 , which led to the conviction of four private detectives for fraud last year			1
@entity67 chairman @entity66 has called for the list to be published for the sake of the victims and because ' innuendo is always worse than full disclosure ' its existence only emerged during an investigation by @entity21			0
@entity1 , the agency dubbed ‘ @entity45 ’s @entity77 ’ , refused to publish it on the grounds it could breach privacy laws and damage commercial interests			2
@entity1 have also said it would be unfair to taint these companies with criminality since there is no evidence			2
@entity1 director general @entity88 said : ‘ i repeat the point we are not alleging that the individuals or companies named on the list have or even may have committed a criminal offence			1
’ the agency said it always intended to pass the list to the @entity4 once the @entity58 investigation was concluded			1
but its change of heart came after growing pressure from @entity100 over a scandal that has been described as ‘ worse than phone hacking ’			0
critics have condemned the police for doing nothing to investigate the blue - chip clients of companies linked to private eyes while media organisations faced unprecedented scrutiny			0
last night the @entity4 said it had received more than 20 files of material from @entity1 , including correspondence between clients and the private investigators and receipts for payments			1
the initial phase of the investigation is expected to take several months			0
last month the @entity120 revealed that 22 law firms feature on the list , alongside several insurance companies , financial services groups and two celebrities , among others			0
in reply to @entity128 , a member of the @entity67 , @entity1 also admitted there were up to 100 individual victims of the private investigators			2
mr @entity88 is to appear before the committee tomorrow , with @entity1 ’s interim chair @entity133			0
the committee ’s chairman , @entity66 wants an explanation as to why it has taken @entity1 so long to pass the information to the @entity4			1
he said it is ‘ deeply concerning ’ these files were only passed to the @entity4 24 hours before mr @entity88 ’s appearance before the committee			0
mr @entity66 added : ‘ it is particularly puzzling given that mr @entity88 told the committee that he would be passing on the files to the @entity4 once @entity59 , scheduled to continue until at least april 2015 , was finalised			0
