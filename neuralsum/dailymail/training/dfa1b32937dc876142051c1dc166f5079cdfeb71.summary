by @entity0 published : 23:14 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 08:20 est , 2 august 2013 a cash - strapped council has been slammed for spending an eye - watering £ 361,800 on @entity4 for councillors - claiming that the purchases ' saves money on printing costs '			1
@entity9 announced last week they will be axing up to 1,700 jobs as they look to cut £ 80 million from their budget			1
but town hall chiefs caused outrage after figures revealed they had splashed out the staggering amount of taxpayers cash on @entity4 tablets over the past four years			2
council chiefs said @entity4 usage improved ' productivity ' and saved money on printing and administration shockingly , the average price for each of the 650 devices given to councillors and officers works out at £ 557 per @entity4			1
the average retail price of the swanky electronic devices is between £ 330 - £ 390			0
yesterday the authority defended the decision by claiming the move had saved £ 20,000 each year on their stationary and printing budget			1
but local residents and campaigners were quick to point out the bill still leaves a deficit of £ 281,000			0
the @entity42 said local residents living in the county would be ' dismayed ' by the figures			0
campaign manager @entity46 said : ' in order to have the moral authority to oversee necessary cuts in expenditure , councillors and council staff must ensure that any spending on themselves is necessary and delivering taxpayer value for money			0
councillor @entity56 said @entity4 are a necessity and a must for he needs instant information ' it is certainly open to debate as to whether they needed the taxpayer to provide them with brand new tablet computers , but what 's for sure is that people will be astounded to discover that they have been issuing themselves with @entity4			2
' these are expensive , top - of - the - range , premium products and if they need a council - issue tablet at all , they should be looking at the cheaper alternatives which are available			0
' @entity9 residents will certainly be dismayed at how the savings in printing costs are belittled by the vast bill for the @entity4			1
' local resident @entity76 , 42 , who lives in @entity77 , @entity9 , added : ' they are cutting jobs left , right and centre and then spending thousands on sleek swanky devices for councillors			1
' if its saving £ 20,000 each year but they are spending £ 360,000 on them - it seems like stupid maths to me			0
' by the time they 've paid for themselves almost 14 years down the line , they will probably be obsolete and they will spend it all again on the latest devices			0
' they are luxury items and not a necessity			0
' this funding should go to something much more worthwhile			0
' disability campaigner @entity101 , who launched the @entity9 cares campaign in 2010 , said : ' they can do exactly the same functions on their existing @entity107 's and @entity108 as they can do on @entity4			1
' these people are gadget crazy bureaucrats who are deciding how the rest of us should live our lives			0
' they 're plundering services which are a lifeline to people and yet spend money on things like this			0
' the @entity120 request shows the authority spent the cash on the tablet computers between april 2009 and may 2013			0
it revealed that 63 out of the 75 elected councillors in @entity9 now use @entity4 , with the rest being used by officers figures show 49 people have been given @entity4 on top of electronic devices such as laptops , mobile phones and @entity108			1
and the monthly cost to @entity9 for @entity136 data is £ 4,062.50 , meaning the bill is £ 48,750 annually			1
council chiefs said @entity4 usage improved ' productivity ' and saved money on printing and administration			1
newly - elected councillor @entity56 , who represents the @entity146 ward , said the @entity4 were ' a must '			2
he said : ' before i became a councillor , i thought the @entity4 was a luxury but i now realise it is a necessity and at a time when i and my constituents need instant information it is a must			2
' @entity9 said the @entity4 helped keep councillors connected with their electorate and increased productivity levels			1
a spokesman said : ' mobile computer tablets have been made available to staff and councillors to improve productivity and save money on printing and administrative costs			1
' anyone who wants to use a tablet has to have a sound business case for doing so , explaining how it would help them to do their job and save the council time and money			0
' since councillors have been using @entity4 , very few committee reports are now printed before meetings , which as well as improving the efficiency of the department has already produced ongoing savings			2
' for example , the committee services stationery and printing budget for 2012/13 was reduced by more than £ 20,000 , and a significant sum of this was solely down to councillors using @entity4 to access reports			1
' there is also scope for further additional savings in future years			0
' all councillors now have the option of using an @entity4 , and find they are helping them connect with their electorate better than they have been able to before			2
