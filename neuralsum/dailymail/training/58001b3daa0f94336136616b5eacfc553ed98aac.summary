there are a handful of apps that claim to be able to monitor and identify signs of skin cancer , but the latest may be the most scientifically accurate to date			0
@entity5 uses an algorithm that was developed over two years , using 4,000 images from 500 live dermatological evaluations - and has an accuracy of up to 90 per cent			1
its makers stress that the app does n't offer a full diagnosis , and should n't replace medical advice , but it can identify skin lesions as high risk if they show signs associated with the disease			1
its makers stress it does n't offer a diagnosis , but can identify lesions as high risk if they show signs of disease @entity5 was designed to help users keep track of their moles and learn how at risk they are from melanoma skin cancer using photos of their lesions			1
once an image has been uploaded , a mathematical algorithm analyses it and provides a risk classification			0
if it detects characteristics that could potentially indicate ‘ abnormal or dangerous ’ skin growth , the app will display a warning			2
there are three types of lesions analysed by the @entity5 app. high - risk lesion : this lesion should be seen by a specialist immediately in order to establish if an excision is necessary			1
medium - risk lesion : this lesion should be tracked closely to determine if changes occur and your dermatologist should be aware of it			2
low - risk lesion : no immediate action is required , however a medical opinion at some point is always recommended			1
if the app detects characteristics that could potentially indicate ‘ abnormal or dangerous ’ skin growth , it will display a warning			2
medium and high - risk patients are then given details of nearby dermatologists and doctors through the app. users can additionally track how their moles evolve over time			1
the algorithm was developed by a team of board - certified dermatologists , including @entity76 and @entity77 , mathematicians and image analysis experts			2
its skin pattern recognition is based on fractal analysis , which calculates patterns and dimensions of both a skin lesion and its surrounding tissue			2
by calculating the fractal dimension of both the skin and the lesion , the analysis algorithm detects any abnormal growth patterns , or behaviour			2
over 4,000 images were reviewed and peer reviewed by dermatologists , and more than 500 live patients were assessed to establish the basis of the algorithm			1
the algorithm is also involved in clinical studies to compare it to a dermatologist ’s evaluation of the same lesion and dermoscopy results			0
when compared to the live evaluations , the algorithm matched the results and was accurate in 74 per cent of cases			0
this rose to 90 per cent sensitivity when compared to demoscopy results			0
its skin pattern recognition is based on fractal analysis , which calculates the patterns and dimensions of both a skin lesion and its surrounding tissue ( pictured )			2
by calculating the fractal dimension of both the skin and the lesion , the analysis algorithm detects any abnormal growth patterns , or behaviour but its makers stress it is not a substitute for medical advice , and concerned users should always get skin lesions checked out by a professional			1
as a result , users are directed towards nearby dermatologists and doctors through the app. ‘ skin conditions , in general and skin cancer ( melanoma in particular ) , almost always have a cause related to lifestyle , ’ said the firm			1
the app costs £ 2.99 in the @entity138 and $ 4.99 in the @entity139 , plus a monthly subscription starting at £ 2.99 ( $ 4.99 ) for one month , up to £ 17.49 ( $ 28 ) for a year ‘ [ our ] goal is to help change those lifestyles so that more people stay healthy and the ones that need treatment receive it in time			1

a nevus is a benign , or non-cancerous , melanocytic tumor , more commonly called a mole			0
the majority of moles will never cause problems , but atypical or ‘ dysplastic ’ moles have a higher risk of developing melanoma - the most aggressive form of skin cancer			1
about 65 per cent of melanoma cases can be attributed to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. in addition , @entity5 also tracks local uv exposure , on a daily basis , to help users learn more about the dangers and the risks			0
‘ @entity5 does not intend to provide medical advice or replace a dermatologist ’s opinion , ’ said mr @entity76			1
‘ it does not provide information on whether the mole is a malignant melanoma or a benign pigmented lesion			0
‘ this is why risk classifications that @entity5 provides , always carry an element of physician referral			0
‘ through skin type assessment and behavioural data , @entity5 offers tools that allow users to better understand and track their skin health , bring more fact - based information to their next gp or dermatologist visit and make healthy skin part of their day - to - day lifestyle , ’ said the firm			1
@entity191 from the @entity192 of @entity193 told @entity194 : ' anything that encourages people to examine their skin is welcome , however apps purporting to provide a treatment or diagnosis should be looked at with a high degree of caution			0
' there is a real danger that not only will un-evaluated mole screening apps over-diagnose , but that they may also under - diagnose and falsely reassure the customer , who then does not seek referral for a changing mole			0
' any commercial mole checking devices , particularly those as accessible as apps , must be scientifically evaluated before they can be considered safe			0
' any new device to help distinguish worrying moles from harmless moles should be subject to rigorous assessment and evaluation			0
' the danger is that commercial incentives will get in the way of patient safety and good medicine			0

@entity5 was designed to help users keep track of skin lesions , or moles
it provides *instant* analysis of photos of lesions , plus a risk category
if a lesion is considered ‘ high risk ’ , the app will suggest nearby doctors
algorithm is based on analysis of 4,000 images and 500 patients
during tests , it *correctly* identified at - risk lesions in up to 90 % of cases
the £ 2.99 ( $ 4.99 ) app was designed with dermatologists , but the firm stressed it should not replace medical advice from a doctor
