by @entity0 @entity1 , 16 , from @entity2 , suffers from severe hereditary multiple exostoses which causes painful bone tumours to grow over her body like most 16 - year - old girls , @entity1 loves make - up and painting her nails			1
but behind the pretty exterior lies a gruelling daily fight against a rare and painful condition			2
@entity1 suffers from severe hereditary multiple exostoses ( @entity4 ) , which causes agonising bone tumours to grow all over her body			1
the hook - shaped growths can form at the end of any bone or joint , which then dig in to the muscles and tendons , causing constant pain she likens to a knife wound			1
there is no cure for the genetic condition and the slightest knock can trigger a growth			2
with dozens of thumb - sized tumours on her shoulders , arms , legs , knees , and feet , even getting up from a chair , eating and breathing can be excruciating			1
to add to her pain , pupils at her school bullied her with cruel jibes of ‘ freak ’ and ‘ squint legs ’			2
from as young as seven she was targeted by bullies who taunted her about her illness and her surgical scars where bone had been removed , and even beat her up			2
now the teenager , who is studying for her higher @entity53 at home as she is too weak to attend school , has written a blog about growing up with @entity4 in an attempt to let other youngsters see that it is acceptable to be different			1
@entity1 , from @entity2 , @entity61 , who has endured years of surgery to remove the bony lumps , said : ‘ when young children do n’t understand something , they either ignore it or hurt it			1
' it was awful at the time because i did n’t understand why they were so against me			0
i ended up starving myself as a way of punishing myself because after a while you actually start to believe that you ’re not worth it			0
’ @entity1 , pictured on her first birthday , was four when her parents first spotted a lump on one of her joints			1
she has since developed dozens more boney growths @entity84 , pictured during a school sports day , bruises incredibly easily and even the five minute walk to school can be a struggle @entity1 was four when her parents , @entity92 and @entity93 , first noticed a lump on one of her joints			1
a year later she had her first operation to remove the bony growth			0
since then she has developed dozens more , many of which have regrown even after surgery			0
a knock to her arm or leg is enough to cause a growth to appear			0
they can also cause her hips and knee joints to lock , leaving her in severe pain and immobile			2
she also suffers from @entity111 , where her blood does not clot properly			2
this means she bruises easily and every operation is a risk			0
@entity1 is in so much pain even taking her little brother , @entity121 , five , the five - minute walk to school can be a challenge			1
trying to lead a normal life : @entity1 is in constant pain because of her condition outlet : @entity1 has now started a blog about her experience she said : ‘ sometimes even moving from a chair is quite difficult due to the pain			1
it ’s excruciating when i breathe in and sometimes when i wake up i ca n’t breathe because the spurs cause the muscles and tendons to tighten			0
’ despite her pain , she wants to help other children bullied for their differences realise they are not alone			0
in her blog , @entity1 urges them to read her story and realise things are not as bad as they seem			1
she said : ‘ i want other children to see they do n’t have to put up walls			0
even though some people will be cruel , not all will be			0
they need to have faith in themselves and not let people bring them down			0
’ her mother , an account manager , said : ‘ she ’s a walking miracle			0
she was born nine weeks early			0
she died twice and had to be ventilated and we were told she would probably never walk or talk			0
