when i was an @entity3 navigator , the phrase ' going to @entity1 ' would have meant the @entity4 had turned hot and we were on a one - way trip to deliver nuclear armageddon			1
in my early days in the military , communist - ruled @entity1 was on our target list for destruction , and certainly a country forbidden to visit			1
@entity13 stag parties head off to cities such as @entity15 for a weekend of debauchery , and we now have a large number of @entity1 settled in @entity13			1
happy guests : @entity19 visited @entity1 with his family to attend the wedding of an old friend more importantly , a few years ago my old friend @entity23 met @entity24 , a beautiful @entity1 girl working as a nanny in @entity27			1
and so it came to pass that i eventually went to @entity1 - not in an @entity29 , but with my wife and daughter , who are both called @entity32 , on a more comfortable @entity34 flight and armed only with a wedding present for @entity23 and his bride			1
@entity24 ( the @entity1 nickname for any girl named @entity39 ) comes from @entity40 , a small town 70 miles southwest of @entity42			1
as we neared her home , her family and neighbours came out to give us a fantastic welcome , setting the scene for a weekend of enthusiastic friendliness and unbridled hospitality			2
water enthusiasts flock to the @entity52 - the focal point of the town and its increasing tourist industry we were staying at @entity56 in the centre of @entity58 , which was also the location for the wedding feast			1
the owner , @entity61 , was a most convivial host , while the rooms were clean , comfortable and incredibly good value at about £ 50 a night , including breakfast for all three of us			2
as we discovered , food was to play an ever increasing part of our brief stay in @entity1			1
our first experience was at the local pizza restaurant , where 14 of us feasted on huge pizzas washed down with copious quantities of beer and red wine			2
the bill came to an embarrassingly small £ 100			2
breakfast the next morning took nearly an hour to complete , with platters of cold meats , cheeses , eggs and pastries flowing from the kitchen until we had to call a halt to the endless procession			0
in an effort to diminish the calorific intake , we strolled through the dense pine forest down to the beautiful @entity52 , the focal point of the town and its increasing tourist industry			0
watersports enthusiasts flock here during the summer for sailing and water - skiing , and in the winter for iceskating tournaments			0
back at @entity56 's for the wedding celebrations , i was amazed to see tables already groaning under the weight of salads , fish dishes , breads , cold cuts and countless bottles of vodka for the toasts			1
to my astonishment , this was just the starter , and for the next ten hours an array of sumptuous dishes marched from the kitchen			0
flagons of soup were followed by endless platters of roast meats , fried potatoes and more fish			0
each course was interspersed with increasingly enthusiastic dancing , toasts , speeches and singing			0
while the @entity13 contingent was small , we gave hearty renditions of @entity126 and the @entity127			0
towards the end of the night , our repertoire had faded , so we resorted to @entity130 and that @entity133 favourite @entity131			0
i like to think we gave a decent account of ourselves , but the vodka may have affected my reasoning			0
finally , at 3am , as a gigantic wedding cake was brought in , i dragged myself off to bed , harbouring the uncomfortable thought that another huge breakfast was only a few hours away			2
our family trip to @entity1 was a wonderful insight into a bygone culture of openness and incredible hospitality			1
i just hope stag parties do n't ruin it for the rest of us			0
@entity150 's latest book , the @entity151 , is published by @entity152 , priced £ 8.99			0
@entity34 ( ryanair.com ) offers flights to @entity42 from @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 , with one - way fares starting at £ 18.99pp			1
it can also arrange car hire .			0

phrase ' going to @entity1 ' would have meant the @entity4 had turned hot
but this time he flew with @entity34 and was armed only with presents
visited @entity40 for friend *’s* wedding to a @entity1 woman he met in @entity27
