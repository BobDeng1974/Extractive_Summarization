the science that could allow babies with three parents to be born in @entity5 is unproven and may be unsafe , a leading @entity1 scientist warned last night			1
the government could give the go - ahead as early as next year for children to be born using genetic material from two mothers and a father – making the @entity5 the first country in the world to license the technique for clinical use			1
but professor @entity16 , the top scientific adviser on the issue to @entity1 authorities , yesterday warned there were unresolved safety concerns			1
a top scientist warned there was years more testing to be done before the technology , which helps families have healthy babies , can be introduced ( file image ) the procedure is designed to give couples who have endured the heartache of repeatedly miscarrying or burying much - longed - for children the option of having a healthy family			1
it helps women with damaged mitochondria – which power cells by turning food into energy			0
the defect causes serious illness in one in 6,500 babies and is behind 50 genetic diseases , many of which kill in infancy			1
women carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly and often face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be best to remain childless			0
but scientists want to swap healthy mitochondria from an egg donated by a woman into the egg of the mother - to - be			1
the @entity5 @entity56 said this year there was no evidence that the technique would be unsafe			2
but professor @entity16 , who chairs the scientific panel advising the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) , believes years ’ more research is needed before the technique is used			1
speaking to the independent newspaper , he said : ‘ the panel was not in any way antagonistic towards this intervention			0
‘ the diseases are terrible , the treatments are non-existent and the technology so far is a tour de force			2
' however , everybody concluded that there is still more work to be done			2
scientists want to swap healthy mitochondria from an egg donated by a woman into the egg of the mother - to - be			2
pictured , a single sperm is injected into an egg via @entity82 ‘ the gap i ’m talking about is about how much pre-clinical scientific work needs to be done before scientists or someone on the @entity62 would feel comfortable that we ’re assured of safety			0
’ asked whether it would be justifiable to permit the procedure to go ahead on compassionate grounds , professor @entity16 said it should not be allowed until all the extra research is completed			1
he said : ‘ we do n’t know whether these changes will be passed to future generations			0
’ the @entity5 ’s proposals involve the replacement of all mitochondria in a mother ’s egg with that from a donor , rather than mixing it together from the two different mothers as intended in the @entity1			0
critics say the technique defies nature and crosses a crucial ethical line because it could be altered to create ‘ designer babies ’			0
by swapping genetic material before conception , doctors could create babies made to order by hair or eye colour			0
even among those who do not oppose the technique on ethical grounds , many fear that we have insufficient scientific evidence that it is safe .			0

science that could allow three - parent babies is ' unproven ' , scientist said
professor @entity16 said there is ' still more work to be done ' on issue
the government could give the green - light as early as next year for new technology
