@entity0 believes @entity2 's greatest achievement as a football manager is the making of @entity5			1
@entity6 and @entity5 come face - to - face on saturday when the former 's @entity10 travel to @entity13 leaders @entity8			1
the duo have been friends since they first worked together at @entity16 in 1997 where they enjoyed a successful relationship at the @entity20			1
@entity2 's ( right ) greatest achievement in football is the making of @entity5 , feels @entity0 @entity5 ( left ) and @entity6 will come face to face again when @entity8 host @entity10 on saturday @entity5 ( left ) worked under @entity6 as his assistant manager at @entity16 for three years in 1997 with @entity5 as the @entity28 's assistant , they won the @entity30 title twice in their first two years together in @entity31			1
it was @entity6 who entrusted and encouraged the @entity34 to go into management - with the 52 - year - old having won titles in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 since as well as the @entity41 twice			1
and in his column for the @entity43 , @entity0 says @entity6 will be proud of his friend 's achievements			0
' a former @entity47 leader once said when asked what their greatest achievement was : " @entity51 , " the former @entity10 and @entity38 defender wrote			2
' i can imagine @entity2 , when answering the same question from a group of journalists , peering back from his desk and responding : " @entity5 "			2
' ahead of saturday 's clash at @entity59 have been dealt a quadruple injury blow with the news that @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 will all be unavailable			0
@entity6 though will be able to call on the services of the in - form @entity67			0
the @entity70 midfielder has scored twice in @entity10 's last four league games - including a header in their 4 - 2 derby win over rivals @entity74 on april 12			0
@entity65 ( right ) is one of four @entity10 players who will miss their league trip to @entity8 due to injury the @entity78 have in - form midfielder @entity79 ( left ) available for the trip to @entity81 @entity67 ( right ) scored @entity10 's second goal in their 4 - 2 win over @entity74 on april 12 and @entity0 believes @entity5 may try to nulify the threat of the big @entity70 midfielder by selecting @entity86 or @entity87 in midfield			1
@entity0 added : ' as for @entity5 , will he blink and deploy @entity86 or @entity87 in midfield alongside @entity89 to deal with @entity67 in that dangerous @entity10 left channel ? ' if he does , how will his team get hold of the ball without the rhythm of @entity95 in that deeper role and feed an attack already hit by the loss of @entity99 ? i could see @entity10 having 60 to 65 % of the ball if @entity5 does opt for this solution			2
' as a tactic , this would n't ordinarily worry the @entity8 manager , but the idea of @entity6 going to @entity81 and not only winning , but also dominating the ball , would maybe open up the wounds of his early encounters with @entity16 while coaching @entity110 , when the @entity16 purists outplayed and beat his team well			2
i â€™m also pretty sure it would not be something that @entity115 would enjoy			0
' my hope is that they go for each other in a manner which suggests that both feel that they are superior in the football department			0
' @entity86 ( centre right ) could start in midfield for @entity8 in a tactic to nullify the threat of @entity67			0
