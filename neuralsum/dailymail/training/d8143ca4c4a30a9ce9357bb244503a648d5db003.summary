by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 2:28 pm on 7th november 2011 more pressure has been heaped on the @entity3 after a damning report found that is continuing to fail			1
the body charged with protecting the country 's borders is already under investigation after damaging revelations last week that vital border checks for criminals and terrorists were secretly abandoned over the summer			1
three senior officials - including @entity15 , the head of the @entity17 border force - have been suspended			1
suspended : @entity18 is now facing the sack after claims that he relaxed passport checks @entity22 will today give an emergency statement on the fiasco to mps , which has led to the establishment of three inquiries			1
the new report has revealed that officials have lost track of a population of asylum seekers and migrants the size of @entity35			2
the latest review of the @entity3 by @entity25 also found that hundreds of foreign nationals who should have been deported are still in the country , and the agency is using euphemistic language designed to deflect attention away from key areas			1
furious : home secretary @entity22 figures revealed the number of ' lost ' asylum and immigration cases had tripled in six months from 40,500 in march to 124,000 in september			1
the so - called controlled archive became a ' dumping ground for cases where the @entity3 has lost track of the applicant ' , the @entity48 said			1
the ' controlled archive ' , the @entity25 said , was ' a bureaucratic term which hides the true nature of a government department 's activity and is designed to deflect attention away from it '			2
it would more appropriately be called ' an archive of lost applicants ' , they said			2
the archive includes cases in which around 98,000 asylum seekers can not be found and the agency has no idea whether the applicant even remains in the @entity17 , legally or otherwise			1
it also includes around 26,000 migrants following a review of cases , most of which are more than eight years old , and involve those who have overstayed their visas or who have been refused an extension of leave , such as students			2
the agency was also criticised for failing to explain why 350 foreign national prisoners who should have been deported were still in the country			1
of about 1,300 prisoners who were released between april 1 last year and march 31 this year , more than a quarter ( 27 % ) were labelled ' unknown '			0
the agency was even unable to disclose how many individuals were removed from the country based on intelligence provided by members of the public			1
unless the public can see that officials use the intelligence provided , ' it will simply lead to further public frustration with the immigration system as a whole ' , the @entity25 said			0
more problems : further pressure has been heaped on the @entity3 following a damning report by mps meanwhile , whistleblowers have blamed the latest border checks scandal on an official obsession with cutting queuing times at the nation ’s air and sea ports			1
@entity106 spoke out following the revelations that a senior @entity3 official had secretly abandoned checks on passports and even anti-terror watch lists for @entity113 citizens			0
investigators are examining allegations that @entity15 , the £ 135,000 - a - year head of the @entity117 , approached the home secretary ’s office for permission to weaken passport checks during the busy summer months			1
senior figures say he was explicitly told ‘ no ’ in writing – but then went ‘ rogue ’ and implemented the proposal anyway			0
ministers had agreed to one relaxation of the rules – but he then went much further , it is understood			0
investigations will also focus on whether port operators , including @entity132 which runs most of the @entity17 ’s major airports , were complicit in the decision because they wanted to avoid queues			0
@entity3 staff claim they were put under enormous pressure to avoid lengthy queues and delays which would infuriate passengers			1
last night , @entity141 , national chairman of the @entity3 union @entity142 , said : ‘ government imposed job cuts have exacerbated the internal problems within the agency along with a misplaced focus on reducing queue times at air and sea ports			2
our members have been and continue to be , opposed to watered down measures which undermine their ability to secure our nation ’s borders to the highest degree possible			2
’ the @entity157 revealed on saturday how immigration officers were told secretly not to bother checking biometric chips on the passports of hundreds of thousands of citizens from outside the @entity162			0
staff were also instructed not to check their fingerprints or other details against a ‘ warnings index ’ containing the names of terror suspects and illegal immigrants			0
mrs may is furious and officials have been instructed that , if criminal wrongdoing can be established , prosecutions should be brought			0
during her appearance before @entity25 , mrs may will come under pressure to say whether anybody posing a threat to national security slipped into the @entity17 during the time the checks were relaxed			2
@entity181 will also claim that ministers themselves began the process under which the rules were relaxed			0
officials have confirmed that mrs may and immigration minister @entity187 took a documented decision in july to allow border checks to be downgraded by a level , so that the biometric chips on @entity162 passports would not be checked			0
when approached by the mail , mr @entity15 , who was suspended last thursday and faces the sack , said he could not comment on any of the allegations because of the ongoing investigations			0
the @entity3 was at the centre of another controversy this summer when it emerged officials missed six chances to stop a banned @entity203 activist from entering the @entity17			0
mrs may said an investigation into how sheikh @entity205 was able to enter the @entity17 in june despite being banned found ' insufficiently robust processes ' led to six missed chances to intervene overseas , on departure to , and in the @entity17			0
a new system needed to be brought in to highlight live alerts to @entity17 ports and to the agency 's overseas network , while the police national computer should be amended to include details of those banned from the country , the home secretary said			1

further pressure heaped on under - pressure agency
home secretary to give an emergency statement to the @entity48 on the borders agency fiasco later today
