@entity0 threw down the gauntlet to @entity2 last night and said large countries should be prepared to accept more asylum seekers			1
the @entity6 chancellor demanded a new @entity8 system that distributes asylum - seekers to member states based on their population and economic strength			1
the call comes as @entity14 struggles with the growing refugee crisis in the @entity16 , where hundreds have died in recent days trying to get from northern @entity18 to @entity19			1
mrs @entity0 's call would however mean that @entity28 , one of the most populous countries in the @entity28 and one of its most economically successful , would be expected to take in more people			2
speaking at a campaign event ahead of state elections in @entity42 , she said yesterday that the @entity8 's own rules on asylum - seekers are not working			1
she called for the current rules , known as the @entity47 regulations , to be scrapped			0
' the @entity47 rules need to be changed , ' she told fellow @entity8 leaders			0
' five member states account for three - quarters of all asylum - seekers ' under the present system			2
under the @entity47 regulations , refugees have to claim asylum in the first @entity8 country they enter , and can not pick and choose between member states			2
but @entity6 has long accused southern @entity8 countries of ignoring the rules and encouraging asylum - seekers to move on			1
the majority of refugees arrive on @entity14 's southern shores after crossing the @entity16			1
the border free @entity64 means they can easily move onto to other @entity8 countries , despite the rules			0
the @entity6 government is believed to be particularly concerned that the @entity19 authorities are not doing enough to register asylum - seekers who arrive there			0
the @entity14 leaders gathered this week for an emergency meeting in @entity73 in the wake of the tragedy in the @entity16			1
pictured from left is @entity19 prime minister @entity77 , @entity6 chancellor @entity0 , @entity79 president @entity78 and @entity28 prime minister @entity2 @entity6 believes it is being made to bear an disproportionate burden of asylum - seekers lured there by its strong economy			1
in 2014 , @entity6 received 173,070 asylum applications , more than twice as many as any other @entity8 country			0
in the same period , the @entity28 received 31,260 applications , according to @entity88 refugee agency			0
her remarks came a day after mr @entity2 flatly ruled out @entity28 taking part in an voluntary @entity8 scheme to ' resettle ' north @entity18 migrants throughout the continent			2
he told his counterparts at the @entity8 summit that the @entity28 is already ' playing its part ' in the region through the aid budget and offer of ships , and takes in its ' fair share ' of refugees compared to other member states			0
@entity105 , the @entity106 president , said earlier on thursday that @entity8 leaders must ' sacrifice some national interests for the common good ' by taking part in a ' resettlement ' programme .			0

@entity0 has *challenged* @entity2 to accept more asylum seekers
she said a new @entity8 system was needed based on countries ' economies
it comes as @entity14 reacts to several boat tragedies in the @entity16
