in the past year experts including @entity1 and @entity2 have said the rise of ‘ super-intelligent ’ robots poses a threat to humanity			1
and now @entity8 co-founder @entity7 , too , has joined the voices calling for caution			1
he said the rise of @entity12 should be a concern , and he does n't understand why people are not taking the threat seriously			1
in an @entity18 on @entity18 he said he is ' concerned about super intelligence '			1
and he said he does n't understand why some people are not concerned			1
he also revealed @entity8 was working on a virtual ' personal agent ' taking part in an @entity18 ( @entity18 ) q&a session on @entity18 , mr @entity7 - who lives in the state of @entity26 , @entity22 - said : ‘ i am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence			1
‘ first the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent			2
that should be positive if we manage it well			0
‘ a few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern			2
i agree with @entity1 and some others on this and do n't understand why some people are not concerned			1
’ it has been suggested that as robots become more advanced , and we ask them to perform more and more tasks , they may be unable to empathise with human ethics and morals			0
source : philosophical @entity49 ' suppose that the programmers decide that the @entity12 should pursue the final goal of “ making people smile ”			1
' to human beings , this might seem perfectly benevolent			0
thanks to their natural biases and filters , they might imagine an @entity12 telling us funny jokes or otherwise making us laugh			1
' but there are other ways of making people smile , some of which are not - so benevolent			2
you could make everyone smile by paralsying their facial musculature so that it is permanently frozen in a beaming smile			0
' such a method might seem perverse to us , but not to an ai			2
it may decide that coming up with funny jokes was a laborious and inefficient way of making people smile			2
facial paralysis is much more efficient			0
' specifically , they may not be able to really understand right from wrong like a human does , no matter how safely we think we have programmed them			2
back in december , professor @entity2 echoed @entity7 ' sentiments , telling the @entity84 : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			1
' this followed claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating @entity12 ' would be the biggest event in human history , [ but ] unfortunately , it might also be the last			1
' in november , @entity1 , the entrepreneur behind @entity96 and @entity97 , warned that the risk of ' something seriously dangerous happening ' as a result of machines with artificial intelligence , could be in as few as five years			1
he has previously linked the development of autonomous , thinking machines , to ' summoning the demon '			0
speaking at the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) @entity107 in october , @entity1 described artificial intelligence as our ' biggest existential threat '			1
he said : ' i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence			2
if i had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is , it 's probably that			2
so we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence			0
' i 'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight , maybe at the national and international level , just to make sure that we do n't do something very foolish			0
' with artificial intelligence we 're summoning the demon			0
you know those stories where there 's the guy with the pentagram , and the holy water , and … he 's sure he can control the demon ? does n't work out			0
' @entity7 ' warning on @entity12 echoes similar comments made by @entity1 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right )			1
in december professor @entity2 told the @entity84 : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race , ' while @entity1 has warned of ' something seriously dangerous happening ' it has been suggested that as robots become more advanced ( stock image shown ) , and we ask them to perform more and more tasks , they may be unable to empathise with human ethics and morals elsewhere in the @entity18 , mr @entity7 answered some other questions from @entity18 users			1
responding to one comment , he hinted at a new technology he was working on that could act as a sort of personal assistant , although he did not elaborate much further			1
earlier this month @entity8 revealed a ' holodeck ' headset that allows wearers to see 3d images superimposed over their vision			1
the wireless headset , called @entity155 , can project 3d images into the wearer 's field of view - making it appear as if screens , games and even people are in front of them			0
it uses a visor to project ' holographic ' images onto the wearer 's field of view			0
it uses sensors to track the wearer 's head to ensure the hologram is in the same way			0
a projection system them beams the holographic images into the wearer 's eye , fooling the brain into thinking they are real			0
the cameras also has a camera to track the user 's hands , allowing them to interact with the holographic images			0
‘ one project i am working on with @entity8 is the personal agent which will remember everything and help you go back and find things and help you pick what things to pay attention to , ' he said			1
‘ the idea that you have to find applications and pick them and they each are trying to tell you what is new is just not the efficient model - the agent will help solve this			0
it will work across all your devices			0
’ and if @entity8 had n’t worked out for him when he started the company back in 1975 , mr @entity7 said he ‘ would probably be a researcher on @entity12			1
’ he continued : ‘ when i started @entity8 i was worried i would miss the chance to do basic work in that field			1
’ he also had time to comment on the newly revealed @entity155 , saying : ‘ the @entity155 is pretty amazing			0
@entity8 has put a lot into the chips and the software			2
' it is the start of virtual reality			0
making the device so you do n't get dizzy or nauseous is really hard - the speed of the alignment has to be super super fast			2
it will take a few years of software applications being built to realize the full promise of this			0
