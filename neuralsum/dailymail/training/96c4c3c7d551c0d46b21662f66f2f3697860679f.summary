by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 political editor published : 07:52 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 18:28 est , 19 november 2013 security firm @entity3 has admitted overcharging taxpayers by more than £ 24million for ‘ phantom ’ electronic tags that had been removed – or were never fitted in the first place			1
but the government yesterday refused to accept its offer of a ‘ credit note ’ for the sum and is expected to draw up its own bill once an investigation by the @entity14 is concluded			1
it is thought that @entity3 , and another tagging firm @entity16 , overcharged for tens of thousands of criminals , including those who had left the country , been returned to prison or even died			1
ministers fear taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals @entity3 said its investigation had ‘ not identified any evidence of dishonesty or criminal conduct ’ by any of its staff			1
a spokesman said it accepted it ‘ wrongly considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been removed ’			2
the credit note issued yesterday was for £ 23.3million for bills wrongly issued between 2005 , when the contracts began , and may this year			2
the firm said another note would follow for £ 800,000 for bills wrongly issued from june this year			1
this indicates the company continued to overcharge even after the @entity41 announced its investigation into billing practices in may			0
probe : global security firm @entity3 is to be investigated by the @entity14 over tagging contacts dating back more than a decade a @entity47 report into the electronic monitoring contracts published today found evidence the firms were charging for multiple tags on individual criminals			1
in one case @entity16 charged more than £ 15,000 for monitoring an offender whose home was not even fitted with the equipment			2
a spokesman said justice secretary @entity58 has been clear that he is ' determined to secure a refund for the taxpayer '			0
the @entity62 - based security firm traces its roots back to a guarding company founded in @entity65 in 1901			0
@entity3 was formed when @entity66 merged with @entity67 in 2004			2
the company has a long record of blunders including : in 1993 @entity66 became the first private company to run prisoner escort services , m and lost seven inmates in three weeks a year later a hunger striker escaped from @entity75 detention centre , guarded by @entity66 in 1997 it emerged the firm had transferred a prisoner between two vans on a petrol station forecourt three prisoners escaped from @entity82 in 2001 in 2011 , @entity3 staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over @entity86 put an electronic tag on criminal @entity89 's artificial limb in 2012 the firm failed to train enough guards for the @entity92 which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave in march this year a @entity3 guard at @entity96 ordered @entity98 engineer @entity97 to change out of her uniform before flying to the @entity100 because it was ' offensive ' the spokesman added : ' we have taken appropriate legal advice and will pursue all possible avenues			1
' this matter is now the subject of a criminal investigation			0
we are not able to comment further at the current time			0
we will make a further statement when it is appropriate to do so			0
' @entity3 refused to co-operate with a forensic audit of its work - and that of fellow contractor @entity16 - which a public spending watchdog revealed had already cost the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) more than £ 2 million			1
the firm said it now accepted it had ‘ wrongly considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been removed ’			2
it said : ‘ this billing practice ... was not consistent with the contract or @entity3 ’s values and the company has apologised to the @entity41 and issued credit notes totalling £ 23.3 million for amounts incorrectly billed between 2005 and may 2013			1
‘ a further credit note of £ 0.8 million will be issued for billings for the period from june 2013 to date			0
’ there was no evidence that it extended to any of its other @entity130 contracts , said the firm , which has faced repeated criticism of its performance , not least over security for the @entity135			0
@entity3 group chief executive @entity136 said the offer was ‘ an important step in setting this matter straight and restoring the trust which has been earned by our many thousands of committed and hard - working employees over many years ’			2
@entity3 @entity62 and @entity144 chief executive @entity143 will face questions from mps over the scandal tomorrow when he appears before the @entity149 public accounts committee			1
@entity151 general secretary @entity150 said : ‘ privatisation has been imposed on the public with the lie that it is more efficient and saves us money			0
‘ as well as raking in billions of pounds of our money , these companies are shielded from public scrutiny and are almost entirely unaccountable			0
‘ who knows how many more times we have been ripped off ? ’ @entity164 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said the admission by @entity3 was ' staggering ' @entity167 mp @entity164 , chairman of the @entity168 , said : ' the admission of @entity3 today is staggering			1
' the company refused to co-operate with the government , which led to the referral to the @entity14 , and that should have rung alarm bells			1
it represents serious corporate failure			0
' contracts of this kind need to be conducted in good faith and represent value for money			0
every @entity3 contract with the government needs to be reviewed immediately , and they should be banned from bidding for any more			1
' after the @entity186 shambles , the @entity168 recommended that the government implement a high - risk register to stop this happening again			0
' had it been adopted , the overbilling from june may have been prevented			0
' the firms will be billed for the £ 2million cost of the audit that uncovered the overcharging .			2
