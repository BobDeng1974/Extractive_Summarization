the report into the murder of @entity3 solicitor @entity2 was publsihed today			1
the 38 - year - old was shot at his north @entity3 home by loyalist paramilitaries the @entity7 in 1989 @entity8 said the government was ‘ deeply sorry ’ yesterday after a report into the murder of solicitor @entity2 found the security services colluded with the loyalist terrorists who killed him			1
a review of the case by sir @entity17 , @entity18 , found the father - of - three would probably not have been executed by the @entity7 without the encouragement of @entity22 agents			1
sir @entity17 said state employees ‘ furthered and facilitated ’ the shooting of the 38 - year - old , who was gunned down in front of his family in 1989			1
but his finding that there was no evidence of an over-arching conspiracy involving ministers or security chiefs to target mr @entity2 sparked calls for a full public inquiry			1
the widow of murdered @entity3 solicitor mr @entity2 slammed a report into his death as ' a sham ... a whitewash ... a confidence trick '			2
@entity45 said sir @entity17 's report was ' not the truth ' and renewed her call for a full public inquiry			1
in a @entity51 statement today , @entity8 admitted mr @entity2 might still be alive had police and state agencies not colluded in his murder			1
the prime minister said the ' appalling crime ' was the result of ' shocking levels ' of state collusion and apologised on ' behalf of the government and the whole country '			2
the @entity17 review into the 1989 killing found that state employees actively ' furthered and facilitated ' the loyalist murder of mr @entity2			1
but the victim 's family have criticised the review , insisting only a full public inquiry will reveal the truth about his murder			1
the 38 - year - old was shot in front of his wife and children at home by loyalist paramilitaries from the @entity7 in 1989			1
at a press conference after the review was published , mrs @entity45 accused the @entity79 of suppressing the truth while attempting to blame dead individuals and disbanded organisations while exonerating ministers , serving officers and existing security agencies			1
mrs @entity45 said : ' yet another @entity22 government has engineered a suppression of the truth behind the murder of my husband , @entity2			2
' at every turn it is clear that this report has done exactly what was required - to give the benefit of the doubt to the state , its @entity97 and ministers , to the @entity99 , to the intelligence services and to itself			2
' at every turn , dead witnesses have been blamed and defunct agencies found wanting			2
serving personnel and active state departments appear to have been excused			0
' the dirt has been swept under the carpet without any serious attempt to lift the lid on what really happened to @entity2 and so many others			2
' this report is a sham , this report is a whitewash , this report is a confidence trick dressed up as independent scrutiny and given invisible clothes of reliability			2
but most of all , most hurtful and insulting of all , this report is not the truth			0
' mr @entity8 told the @entity51 said the review had found the @entity99 and @entity125 had advance notice of a series of assassinations planned by the loyalist paramilitary group , the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , but nothing was done			1
successive @entity22 governments are accused of a ' wilful and abject failure ' to properly control secret agents within paramilitary groups			0
mr @entity8 said : ' it is really shocking this happened in our country			1
@entity159 demonstrated beyond any doubt by sir @entity17 , which included the involvement of state agencies in murder , is totally unacceptable			1
' we do not defend our security forces or the many who have served in them with great distinction by trying to claim otherwise			0
collusion should never , ever happen			0
' on behalf of the government and the whole country , let me say again to the @entity2 family i am deeply sorry			0
' the review found no evidence that any government was informed in advance of mr @entity2 ’s murder or knew about the subsequent cover - up			2
sir @entity180 , former @entity181 leader , said he had never heard a statement in the @entity51 which filled him with more ' revulsion '			0
however , today mr @entity2 's son @entity134 said he could not believe that there had been a public inquiry into newspapers hacking mobile phone messages but not into state involvement in the death of a @entity22 lawyer			1
‘ we 're talking about the murder of a lawyer in the @entity22 , ’ he told @entity193 ’s today programme			0
‘ i rather flippantly announced last year that i thought it would have been easier if my father 's phone had been hacked rather than being killed			0
that 's not in any way to disrespect the victims of phone hacking			0
‘ but if we can have an inquiry into something as important as that , this case is the murder of a lawyer which the @entity22 government have admitted there was collusion , you do n't then deal with that , such a fundamental attack on democracy , by holding a non-statutory review behind closed doors			1
’ @entity8 told the @entity51 the report revealed ' shocking ' levels of state collusion mr @entity8 has apologised more than once for the collusion between police and the loyalists responsible for the murder			1
but mr @entity2 added today : ‘ an apology is not in the correct running order			0
you do n't apologise for something but then not fully admit what it is you 're apologising for			0
i think that 's what the prime minister has done			0
’ the @entity2 are unhappy that in 2001 the @entity22 government agreed during peace talks to meet honour for public inquiries into deaths			0
of five recommended , four were held but in mr @entity2 's case it was rejected			0
mr @entity239 said : ' the only case that 's outstanding is the case of my father			0
this review , we feel , is the embodiment of a broken promise of the @entity79			0
we do feel that if they are sincere in dealing with this issue then they need to grasp this issue and they need to deal with it in a credible fashion			0
' the loyalist paramilitaries shot mr @entity2 14 times as he sat eating a sunday meal at home , wounding his wife in the process			2
the couple 's three children witnessed the attack			0
the former head of the @entity264 in @entity139 , sir @entity263 , has previously investigated collusion claims surrounding mr @entity2 's death			2
shortly after starting the new inquiry , the @entity263 team charged former @entity270 agent and loyalist quartermaster @entity271 in connection with the killing			2
sir @entity274 has completed his 500 - page report into the 1989 killing , which is published today former met police commissioner sir @entity263 published the results of his four - year inquiry into @entity2 's murder in 2003			1
the report confirmed that rogue elements in the security forces were involved in a deadly plot with loyalist paramilitaries to carry out a series of sectarian murders in @entity287 but in november 2001 the case collapsed and he was shot dead outside his home within weeks			1
in september 2004 a loyalist accused of murdering the solicitor pleaded guilty to murdering him			0
@entity292 entered his plea at the beginning of his trial			0
prime minister @entity8 , who ordered the @entity17 review , will deliver a statement to the commons in 2004 , retired @entity300 judge mr justice @entity299 , asked by the government to investigate cases of suspected collusion , concluded that military and police intelligence knew of the @entity2 murder plot and failed to intervene			1
he recommended a public inquiry			1
that year , @entity292 was sentenced to 22 years ' imprisonment			0
in 2004 , then @entity287 secretary @entity309 announced an inquiry under new legislation introduced in 2005			0
the @entity2 family opposed the @entity313 , arguing it would allow government to interfere with the independence of a future inquiry because a government minister could rule whether the inquiry sat in public or private			2
as a result , plans to establish an inquiry were halted by former @entity287 secretary @entity322			0
in october 2011 , the government ruled out a public inquiry into mr @entity2 's murder but put forward a proposal for a leading @entity18 to review the case			1
that review is to be published today .			1

38 - year - old was shot dead in front of his wife and children at home in 1989
report by sir @entity274 published today reveals the killing might not have happened without the involvement of security agencies
@entity45 has repeatedly called for a full public inquiry
@entity8 admitted there was collusion between police and loyalists responsible for the killing but only ordered a review of the case
