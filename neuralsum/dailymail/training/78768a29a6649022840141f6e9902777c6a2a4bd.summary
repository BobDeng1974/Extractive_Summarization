a three - year - old @entity0 who currently lives at a rescue centre is struggling to find a new home because potential owners are put off by his cross-eyes			2
rescue dog @entity5 was given to the @entity8 branch in @entity9 , @entity10 , a month ago after his owner was no longer able to care for him			1
he was born with a condition called strabismus which means his eyes are not correctly aligned and point in different directions			1
he has since been unable to find new owners he was born with a condition called strabismus which means his eyes are not correctly aligned and point in different directions			1
despite the condition not affecting his eyesight , potential owners are said to put off despite his condition , he has relatively good eyesight but it has hampered him in finding a new home as potential owners are put off because of his eyes			1
@entity27 , support relations officer at the centre , said : ' we take in hundreds of dogs of all shapes and sizes but i have never seen anything quite like @entity5			0
' some people will overlook any dogs that have a slight health problem or appear different , and even with his striking good looks and fun personality @entity5 is often passed by - possibly due to his unusual eyes			2
' but he is such a cheeky character			2
he is an affectionate , fun loving boy who adores his carers and loves to be with other dogs			0
' this energetic boy is looking for an active family , could live with children as young as six and must be rehomed with another dog			0
' @entity5 may not be winning any frisbee catching competitions any time soon but he is a super dog who will make a fantastic pet in the right home so we have everything crossed he will find it soon			0
' @entity5 has been described by staff at the rescue centre as a ' cheeky character ' and ' fun loving boy ' the ' happy ' dog is the first the rescue centre in @entity10 has come across with the cross-eyed condition @entity5 's condition is not degenerative and does not cause him any problems			1
@entity67 , @entity8 veterinary director , added : ' we rarely see a dog at our rehoming centres with this condition and @entity5 is definitely the only cross-eyed @entity0 i have come across			0
' fortunately , @entity5 is a happy dog and his new owner will not need to treat him differently from a fully sighted dog , though they do need to consider he may find it slightly harder to focus which can make it more difficult for him to catch a ball			0

@entity5 has condition called strabismus which means his eyes are *n't* aligned
rescue dog has relatively good eyesight but is being overlooked by owners
given to @entity10 dog centre after owner could no longer care for him
staff *hoping* owners will overlook condition and adopt ' cheeky character '
