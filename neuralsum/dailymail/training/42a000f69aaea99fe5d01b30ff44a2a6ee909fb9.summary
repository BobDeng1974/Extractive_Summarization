for years , the @entity11 of @entity12 lay rotting on a @entity6 slipway			1
now , nearly 150 years after she was built , preparations are under way for one last voyage – back to @entity7 , where the vessel will undergo restoration			2
a giant steel cradle has been assembled in @entity21 , @entity22 , so the vessel can be transported to become the centrepiece of a maritime heritage display in @entity25			1
saved : for years it lay rotting on a slipway at the @entity28 , with the cost of repairs put in excess of £ 10m named @entity11 of @entity12 , the vessel was built in @entity33 in 1864 and an estimated 250,000 people can trace their origins to its passengers when it carried emigrants from @entity6 to @entity7			1
for years it lay rotting on a slipway at the @entity28 , with the cost of repairs put in excess of £ 10million			1
some experts even suggested breaking it up as the restoration required was so extensive , it almost required building a new vessel			1

the 176ft ( 53 metre ) ship was purchased by @entity52 following a cholera outbreak for use as a floating isolation hospital			0
legacy : the @entity11 of @entity12 was built in @entity33 in 1864 and an estimated 250,000 people can trace their origins to its passengers when it carried emigrants from @entity6 to @entity7 in 1924 it was converted into a training ship at @entity21 , and renamed @entity60 , but in 1991 the ship sank at the @entity62 , @entity63 , and lay on the bottom of the @entity65 for a year			1

after announcing the decision , @entity75 , minister for culture and external affairs ms @entity75 said : ' @entity11 of @entity12 has an illustrious past shared by two nations , @entity6 and @entity7			0

' we can now have a link between @entity6 and @entity7 which allows both nations to share the vessel ’s historical , cultural and social significance through tourism , interpretation and education			0
' engineers in @entity7 constructed a special 100 - tonne cradle , costing £ 680,000 , from prefabricated sections which has now arrived in @entity21			1
once this is assembled and checked , the hull will be jacked up to allow the cradle to slide underneath			2
@entity113 , the project co-ordinator for the @entity6 museum 's trustees , said the cradle was being assembled in @entity21 under the supervision of one of its @entity85 designers			1
he added : ' the initial assembly is a test assembly to ensure that everything fits as it was made in 20 different locations in @entity7 and so is coming together in @entity21 for the first time			2
it is then subject to loading tests to meet @entity128 's [ of @entity129 ] and insurance requirements before being disassembled prior to fitting around the vessel			0
' no date has been fixed as there are a number of stages and conditions still to be met and , having cleared each of those stages , any movement has to await an appropriate tide , ' he told the @entity140 .			0
