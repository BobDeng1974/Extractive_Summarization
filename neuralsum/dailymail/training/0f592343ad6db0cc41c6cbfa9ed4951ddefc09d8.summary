by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 09:20 est , 6 may 2013 he 's famous for his ravishingly modernist work but designer @entity3 has revealed that his inspiration is firmly rooted in the past			1
and while the @entity8 monarchs that so fascinate him might not have had pinstripe suits and ties , they were , says @entity3 , the world 's first power dressers			1
just as designers in the 1980s used shoulder pads to give the illusion of broad shoulders and size , so @entity19 and her father @entity20 used triangular - shaped garments to create a ' silhouette of power ' , @entity3 points out			1
‘ i ’m very much taken by the idea of the @entity43 being the first power dressers – that idea of using clothes for more purpose than just clothing oneself			1
' [ it is interesting ] how things were started by the monarch , then copied by the court , then by the merchants and the middle classes			2
' it was that trickle - down effect that people still talk about today with fashion and it 's fascinating that that was happening 400 to 500 years ago as well			2
‘ it ’s clothing to present oneself in a particular way , asserting yourself through what you wear			2
’ and he 's not wrong			2
in 1666 , @entity66 announced that he was to introduce a new fashion for men – a long vest worn under a coat , instead of a short doublet and cloak			2
later to become the three - piece suit , the style spread so quickly that three weeks later the diarist @entity75 was wearing his own version			2
@entity3 's own work , which he describes as ‘ a kind of modern armour ’ , is replete with references to 15th century garb , and has included reworked versions of the @entity33 ruff , as well as a wearable spin on @entity20 's famously large suit of armour			1
it 's a far cry from the reliably feminine work of @entity89 and others , but then , as @entity3 puts it : ' @entity91 is n’t really about clothes			1
it ’s more about an idea , an alternate reality			0
' his alternate reality , more often than not , is a @entity29 one - something which came about after a memorable trip to @entity100 as a child			0
power dressing : the triangular shapes favoured by @entity104 ( left ) and @entity19 emphasised their royal status ' i first became interested in the @entity43 and @entity30 when i was very young			1
i remember being brought down to @entity100 for the first time and i was with my dad and brother who were coming to watch @entity110 play at @entity111			0
' because my mum did n't want me to feel left out , because i was n't that much into football , she took me round the tower of @entity100 and [ bought me ] a magazine [ there ]			0
' i remember the first issue : it was all about queen elizabeth i and it came with all these little costume things so you could dress them up , and i remember i was n't very good at drawing heads , so i would get my mum and dad to draw the heads , and then i would draw in the outfit from the neck down			0
' so fond of the period is the designer , he 's teamed up with the @entity132 to produce a potted history of @entity29 fashion ahead of the launch of @entity136 : the @entity137 and @entity91 - the summer exhibition at @entity139			1
' it 's very much about presenting oneself as an icon i guess ... it 's very powerful , ' added the designer			0
' you can sometimes be a little lazy when you look at paintings – you focus on the face , ' he added			0
' this exhibition has much more of an emphasis on what ’s happening from the neck down – and as a fashion designer that ’s my currency			0
inspiring : @entity3 first became interested in the tudor period following a visit to the @entity156 as a child power : according to @entity3 , the @entity8 triangular silhouette was the 15th century equivalent of shoulder pads beginning with the early 16th century , the exhibition traces the changing tastes of the royal courts and the spread of fashion through @entity167 , much of which boasts the triangular shape that has become @entity3 's trademark			1
' i love triangles , ' he adds			0
' you know in physics , the triangle is the strongest shape known to man			0
' it 's all very subtle but in the end it all comes down to that silhouette of power and that 's something i like to inject into my own work			2
' ' these garments served a function and are as important as the portraits themselves – it was their language and how they communicated on a non-verbal level			0
that ’s an exciting aspect of the exhibition			0
' the exhibition 's curator @entity191 said working with @entity3 had been ' fantastic '			1
' it ’s been fantastic to get @entity3 ’s insights into the fashions of the @entity29 and @entity30 and to realise that some of the trends popular more than 400 years ago still echo on the world ’s catwalks today , ’ she said			1
in @entity136 : the art of @entity29 and @entity91 runs from the 10 may until 6 october at the @entity201 in @entity139			0
for tickets and visitor information , see @entity204 resemblance : some of @entity3 's pieces bear a striking similarity to @entity20 's famously large set of armour ravishing : garments such as this worn by @entity212 , duchess of @entity213 , were intended to scream vip			1

' their clothes were devices of subliminal power , ' says @entity3
fascination began after childhood visit to @entity156
