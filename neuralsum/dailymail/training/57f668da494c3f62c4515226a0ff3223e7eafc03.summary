by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:41 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 16 july 2013 the @entity2 have been dismissed as ' naive or reckless ' by the conservatives for demanding a huge downgrade in @entity7 's nuclear deterrent			1
the @entity9 missile system could take weeks to launch under @entity2 proposals for the country to take a ‘ step down the nuclear ladder ’			1
@entity14 defence secretary @entity13 warned the plan failed to take account of possible future threats from @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
ageing : the @entity9 fleet will come to the end of its life in the mid- 2020s but the government is committed to replacing it treasury chief secretary @entity25 has drawn up @entity2 plans to cut the number of @entity9 submarines from four to two – and send them to sea without nuclear warheads			1
a leaked document reveals that the party plans to have just ‘ one submarine in a state of readiness measured in weeks ’ while the other is being used for training or undergoing maintenance			2
but mr @entity13 said there was no way of knowing who @entity7 's future enemies will be , and warned @entity20 , @entity18 and @entity19 could all pose threats up to 2060			1
he told @entity44 : ' i think it ’s frankly either naïve or reckless just because we do n’t perceive an immediate threat today does n’t mean there wo n’t be a threat over the 60 - odd year time horizon we ’re looking at here			1
' we 've got countries like @entity18 and @entity19 attempting to build nuclear weapons and already possessing long - range missiles			2
' we ca n’t say who the potential adversary might be in the future – @entity20 is investing $ 150billion in renewing its forces , we ca n’t say where the threats will come from			0
' we have had for 45 years now a continuous at - sea defence posture that has served this country very well and we do not believe that with nuclear threats if anything proliferating , with more countries seeking to get nuclear weapons , this is a time to downgrade , certainly not to go to a part - time deterrent			2
' warning : defence secretary @entity13 ( left ) said @entity2 treasury minister @entity25 could not predict what future threats lie ahead the @entity9 fleet is designed so at least one submarine is continuously at sea so that @entity7 ’s enemies know it could retaliate if attacked			1
both the @entity76 and @entity77 back @entity9 ’s renewal in the 2020s			1
but mr @entity25 used a speech today at the @entity81 to reveal the results of a @entity2 study on the next generation of @entity9 subs			1
he argued that the @entity7 should save money because it no longer needs a @entity88 - type defence posture			0
he acknowledged it would mean accepting a ' different calculation of risk ' but said he believed such a change was now justified			0
' if continuous - at - sea deterrence is an insurance policy , we 're paying too high a premium for our needs , ' he said			0
' the argument that a current adversary would take the opportunity to target the @entity7 during a period when no boat is covertly deployed and launch an overwhelming nuclear strike against @entity7 is , frankly , not supported by any analysis i have seen			0
he added : ' this is the ultimate guarantee we often talk about			0
but the reality is that in the current circumstances - and for the foreseeable future - that guarantee does not need to sit on a hair trigger			0
' the liberal democrat @entity112 document reveals the party is ‘ wholly unconvinced ’ the @entity7 needs its existing fleet and envisages a future government issuing ‘ a declaratory policy of going to sea with unarmed missiles ’ – meaning subs would have to return to base in the event of an international crisis to get the necessary armaments			0
deterrent : a trident missile launches from a nuclear - powered submarine and , in a clear sign that the @entity2 want to abolish @entity7 ’s nuclear arsenal altogether , the leaked paper argues that the @entity7 should start ‘ identifying a long - term exit route ’ from their ownership			1
‘ surely we now have an opportunity at least to “ step down the nuclear ladder ” , ’ the document states			0
deputy prime minister @entity138 said he hoped the report would open a ' fact - based debate ' on @entity9 , ahead of the key decisions on the submarine replacement programme due to be taken in 2016 , after the general election			1
' it clearly shows that there are options for our country that do not simply involve us sticking to the same strategic positions that were taken in the @entity88 , ' he said			0
but he was slapped down by @entity149 who insisted @entity151 was committed to retaining the full deterrent			2
' the prime minister believes in continuous at - sea deterrence			0
it is as simple as that , ' mr @entity151 's official spokesman said			0
' he has seen no evidence that there are credible alternatives			0
' mr @entity25 mapped out the plan for two @entity9 submarines after the @entity2 ’ preferred option – cruise missiles mounted on ships , subs and aircraft – was comprehensively junked by @entity169 officials as ruinously expensive			1
the @entity2 document admits : ‘ alternative systems , such as cruise missiles in tactical submarines or surface vessels , or air - launched systems , were found to be technically viable but very expensive			1
’ defence experts last night rubbished the plan as liable to leave @entity7 open to attack			2
@entity178 , the former @entity179 , told the @entity180 : ‘ i find this extraordinary			0
the reason we picked this system [ @entity9 ] was because it is undetectable and almost invulnerable			1
‘ these plans are a mechanism for making something invulnerable very vulnerable			0
once you have to come back to fit warheads , or spend long periods lying alongside , it gives your enemies the chance to kill your deterrent			1
’ a @entity14 source said : ‘ deploying a so - called nuclear deterrent without nuclear warheads would n’t deter anyone			2
‘ we ’d have submarines rusting away in port doing nothing , protecting nothing and vulnerable to a first - strike attack			2
‘ it would be a massive gamble with our national security			0

@entity13 says @entity2 plan is ' either naive or reckless '
@entity25 ' wants to cut number of @entity9 submarines from 4 to 2 '
*critics* have warned it would lead to an *ineffective* deterrent
both the @entity76 and @entity77 back @entity9 ’s renewal in the 2020s
