' people are sick of insider gossip and i 'm not going to indulge in any ' mr @entity0 said			1
‘ i 'm not going to be distracted by it , i 'm just getting on with the job			0
mr @entity0 explained his decision grew from the @entity29 's ' budget black hole ' deficit of $ 30 billion			2
' when circumstances change , you do have to change your position , so yes , we did break that commitment , ' he said			0
mr @entity0 said the @entity26 had been flying under the budget radar for years and had entirely escaped an efficiency dividend for the past 20 years			1
' we discovered , when we looked at the @entity26 , that unlike every other media organisation which has had to tighten it ’s belt dramatically in the last few years , the @entity26 was basically getting more money from the government every year , ' mr @entity0 said			1
his comments come after mp @entity5 hit back at the prime minister 's claims of sexism within the @entity45 , after mr @entity0 labelled recent criticisms of his chief - of - staff @entity47 as motivated by gender			1

let me tell you , it does n't matter if her name is @entity70 - r - @entity71 or @entity72 , ' mr @entity5 said			0
' to suggest there 's an issue because of gender i find offensive			0

statement : prime minister @entity0 has the attacks on his chief adviser @entity47 are motivated by sexism ' he needs to be very careful because there 's a lot of cabinet ministers who have a problem with how the prime minister 's office is operating			2
it 's as bad as it 's ever been , ' mr @entity5 said			0
the mp 's comments follow mr @entity0 's slap down of members of his own party on friday amid growing reports of tension between @entity47 - his top adviser - and coalition ministers			1

' they 're like two siamese fighting fish in the same tank ' : earlier this week , that is what a @entity45 frontbencher reportedly said about ms @entity47 , left , and foreign minister @entity117 mr @entity0 said on friday that if people had a problem with his office they should bring the complaints to him , and was backed by supporters who said that unhappy ministers should confront ms @entity47 , rather than air grievances through the media			2

mr @entity5 also criticised the public display of ms @entity47 , who frequently appears in photographs with mr @entity0 , labelling it unusual behaviour			1
mr @entity0 's claims of sexism has already set the @entity182 tittering as the prime minister has long been targeted by critics over his apparent ' women problem			1
' some commentators have alleged that mr @entity0 's comments were made to distract from the decline in popularity of his leadership			1
