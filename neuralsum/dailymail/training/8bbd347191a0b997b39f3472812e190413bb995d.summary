by @entity0 under blazing sunshine in a tiny town in @entity4 , it took just 70 seconds for the first goal of the @entity7 era to arrive			1
he can only hope it is an omen for the far greater challenges that lie ahead			0
the quaint little @entity11 in @entity12 , with a crowd of around 200 , is a world away from the famous and imposing venues @entity16 again hope to visit in the new season ’s @entity17			1
but it was here that @entity7 began his preparations for the forthcoming vital qualifiers and there were early signs of what he wants to see from his side			1
watching brief : @entity7 takes charge of his first match as @entity16 manager @entity16 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity30 ; @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity40			1
subs : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 an accomplished second - minute finish from @entity40 set the @entity56 on his way to a worthwhile victory over opponents who finished fifth in last season ’s @entity61 league			1
operating a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system , @entity7 fielded an entirely different team for each half as he seeks to filter through his options before the first leg against @entity68 in 11 days ’ time			1
he watched calmly but intently from the sidelines throughout , frequently offering vocal encouragement to those now under his charge			0
@entity7 ’s reign as the 17th permanent manager of the @entity76 club is up and running			1
it was a landmark moment for the 38 - year - old , but he kept his cool amid the soaring temperatures			2
‘ i did n’t feel any nerves , ’ @entity7 insisted afterwards			1
‘ i was quite calm			0
of course when the game starts you want to win			0
it was good to get the first victory			0
‘ i can also look at the game and know there are things we need to improve - and we will work on them			2
’ it did n’t take long for @entity7 to have a goal to celebrate			1
some neat passing out from the back saw the ball switched wide right to @entity31			0
quick - fire : striker @entity40 gets @entity16 off to the best possible start with an early goal he swept it forward from deep to send @entity101 in behind a static @entity103 defence			1
a nimble touch over the advancing goalkeeper provided an impressive finish to the first scoring move of a new management tenure			2
‘ it was good , i thought i do n’t have to do anything , ’ said @entity7 , breaking into a laugh			1
‘ it was a good goal as well , it was a good start but we gave them some chances when we lost the ball in dangerous areas			0
we have to work on being relaxed in those areas and in time that will come			0
’ with @entity120 enjoying some time off following his @entity122 exploits with @entity123 , @entity33 was selected to partner @entity124 at the heart of the @entity16 defence			0
there were more than a few signs of rustiness on display as @entity103 levelled after 19 minutes			0
@entity38 played @entity33 into trouble with a poor pass and the @entity133 international was unable to prevent @entity135 from scampering through to beat @entity30			0
cool head : @entity137 ( centre ) rounds the keeper to score @entity16 's second goal @entity141 then sent a snip of a chance over the bar as @entity16 wobbled before @entity30 was required to block out @entity146 midfielder @entity145			0
the @entity76 club were back in front before the break , though , as @entity36 capitalised on a defensive mix up to calmly angle home a shot			0
@entity7 opted to change his entire line - up at half - time amid punishing conditions , with a raft of youth players joined by the more experienced figures of @entity43 , @entity47 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
it was one of the kids who extended @entity16 ’s lead five minutes after the restart as @entity48 – who enjoyed a profitable loan spell at @entity163 last season - produced a fine , sidefoot finish to despatch a @entity43 cross			1
setback : @entity16 keeper @entity30 fails to stop @entity135 scoring an equaliser @entity103 began to press more and more as the second half wore on , but @entity16 goalkeeper @entity42 produced a clutch of impressive saves to seal a two - goal winning margin			1
next up on their four - match @entity174 tour is sunday ’s visit to face old foes @entity179 in the capital			1
@entity7 hopes to see a process of continual improvement as he tries to imprint his style on the squad			2
‘ we met a very good team tonight and the result was very good , if a little bit flattering , ’ he admitted			2
‘ we did n’t deserve to win the match as we did but we ’re allowed to have good goalkeepers , as well			2
clear thinking : @entity192 does his team talk on the pitch due to the intense heat ‘ there were some good attacks and the young boys in the second half played very well , the attitude was good throughout the whole match			1
‘ we have some way to go physically - and with the play from back – but the times we got it right we got big chances			2
‘ there were @entity16 strips in the crowd and that tells you all about the size of the club			0
but i was focusing on the team and i know how i want my team to perform			2
‘ we are at the beginning of that and i am really looking forward to getting us the way i want			0
when we do that , we will play some good matches because there are a lot of good players here			0
we need more possession but in one year you will see a different picture to what you saw here			0

an accomplished finish from @entity40 set the @entity56 on his way
operating a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system , manager @entity7 fielded an entirely different team for each half
next up on their four - match @entity174 tour is sunday ’s visit to face old foes @entity179
