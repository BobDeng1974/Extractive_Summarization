the @entity0 will reopen for regular trading wednesday after being shut down for two days because of @entity2			1
the exchange said in a statement tuesday that its building and trading floor are fully operational and that normal trading will resume at the usual starting time of 9:30 a.m. there had been erroneous reports monday that the exchange floor had flooded			1
exchange spokesman @entity12 said the exchange 's building did not have any flooding or damage			1
back for business : the @entity0 will re-open on wednesday deluge : officials decided late sunday that it was too risky to ask any personnel to staff the exchanges tuesday marks the first time since 1888 that the @entity0 remained closed for two consecutive days because of weather			1
the earlier shutdown was caused by a massive snow storm			1
sections of @entity28 were inundated with water on tuesday and power was shut off to millions of people and businesses up and down the @entity33			1
@entity28 's financial district was one of the hardest hit when @entity2 slammed @entity37 monday afternoon and through the night			1
initial reports that the exchange was three feet underwater were denied by a press spokesman			1
deserted : the floor of the iconic building stands eerily quiet silent : it is the only time the @entity0 has closed for two days for more than a century ' there has been no damage to our building or systems , and we will conduct tests with the industry today with the aim of reopening @entity55 markets on wednesday , ' @entity0 spokesman @entity12 said in a statement			1
though they would not go into specifics , a number of generators must be located onsite in order for the prospect of a wednesday reopening to be considered , since lower @entity28 remains without power and will likely continue as such for as long as week , according to city power executives			1
the closure has made several records in the history of the exchange , as monday 's closing was the first time that the markets were formally shut since the days following the september 11 attacks in 2001			1
beyond that , it was the first time that it closed since @entity77 27 years ago			1
@entity78 earned itself another black eye after wrongly reporting that the @entity0 was flooded with three feet of water following the worst of @entity2			1
‘ there has been no damage to our building or systems , and we will conduct tests with the industry today with the aim of reopening @entity55 markets on wednesday , ’ @entity0 spokesman @entity12 said in a statement			1
during a live segment on @entity92 ’s show monday night , the anchor spoke with the network ’s meteorologist who based the sensational claim solely on a comment left in a chat room			2
‘ you have an update on the stock exchange situation			2
do we still think that three feet of water got into the exchange ? there seem to be conflicting reports now , ’ @entity92 asked meteorologist @entity98			2
‘ oh , is that right ? you know , i got that from the @entity109 chat bulletin board			2
it was right on there ; it said three feet of water on the floor			2
i do n’t know if there ’s conflicting reports or not , ’ @entity98 said			2
the claim instantly went viral , spreading quickly on social networks and circulating as fact			2
an @entity0 official quickly tried to thwart the rumor , saying that the infrastructure of the landmark @entity122 building was ‘ fine ’			2
a spokesman for the network issued a vague apology , purposefully avoiding the point of the fact that their sources were as murky as the alleged sea water that covered much of lower @entity28			2
‘ @entity133 referenced a @entity109 report that turned out to be incorrect			2
we quickly made an on air correction			2
we regret the error , ’ @entity78 spokesman @entity132 said			0
when today 's closure was announced it was became first time that the @entity0 was closed for two consecutive days due to weather since 1888			1
like much of the city , the @entity0 braced for the impact of @entity2 on sunday , lining up a sandbag barrier outside the building on iconic @entity122			0
@entity146 officials began employing their contingency plans as soon as they came to the decision to close on sunday around 10.30pm			0
traders were able to continue to complete a drastically - reduced level of orders electronically , as many banks have remote systems set up so that employees can work from home in crisis situations			0
the @entity0 , which is a privately - held company in itself , keeps a secondary location up and running in case of emergency where all data is stored			0
the problem there , however , is that the data centre is in @entity164 , @entity165 , which is dealing with potentially more structural damage than @entity37			1
according to @entity122 and @entity168 , the centre boasts a supply of 28 megawatts of power , which equates to the amount used to power 4,500 residential homes			1
additionally @entity0 spokesman @entity174 told the @entity175 that they have a number of generators and sufficient fuel to power the site for at least one week if electricity does not return			0
' i 'm a little surprised that the exchanges could n't secure the technology needed to keep the market operating , ' said @entity185 , a trader from the @entity186 told @entity187			0
' it seems unreasonable that the nation 's financial markets have to shut down just because everyone has located themselves within five miles of each other in @entity165			1
a snow storm in @entity195 would n't shut down trading on the @entity33			0
' the ripple effects are already being seen , as companies are postponing their quarterly earnings , which were scheduled to be released earlier this week			0
according to @entity201 , pharmaceutical giant @entity200 and media conglomerate @entity199 are two of the tardy reportees			0
dozens of companies have postponed earnings reports this week because of the storm , but @entity208 did release results for the third quarter that topped @entity122 expectations			0
@entity208 's revenue fell 3 percent to $ 32.1 billion because of the economic crisis in @entity214 and falling sales in @entity216			0
the company exceeded @entity122 's revenue forecast of $ 31.5 billion largely because of @entity219 , where revenue jumped 8 percent			0
@entity214 stock markets rose broadly tuesday after falling the day before			0
trading was subdued in the wake of the storm			0
@entity226 's @entity225 rose 0.9 percent , @entity228 's @entity227 rose 1.1 percent and the @entity229 in @entity230 was 1.5 percent higher			0
crude oil rose 14 cents to settle at $ 85.68 in electronic trading on the @entity233			0
@entity55 bond trading was closed tuesday			1
electronic trading for @entity55 stock index futures was open , but trading volume was very light and the price moves were minuscule			0
