@entity1 prop @entity0 has announced his retirement from international rugby - just five days after being left out of @entity5 's squad for this season 's @entity6			1
@entity0 , a triple @entity8 winner who played in 95 tests for @entity1 and five as a @entity10 and @entity11 , has called time on his @entity14 career at the age of 33			1
he was also overlooked by @entity1 head coach @entity5 for the autumn internationals earlier this season			2
@entity1 ' @entity18 prop @entity0 had decided to call time on his international career the 33 - year - old in action during a @entity18 training session in june 2013 @entity24 forward @entity25 , 11 years @entity0 ' junior , has established himself as @entity1 ' first - choice tighthead , with @entity27 and @entity28 also named among a 34 - man @entity6 party			1
before the squad was announced , @entity0 had been strongly backed to earn a recall , especially when @entity24 forward @entity33 was ruled out of the entire @entity6 tournament due to a shoulder injury			1
speaking last tuesday , @entity5 said : ' at the moment , @entity25 is our number one tighthead and we have been very impressed with his progress			0
' we know exactly what @entity0 can and ca n't do , and things that he is still working on			2
' i do n't think he is the sort of player that you pick on the bench and ask to make an impact			0
he is a starting number three			0
' i know that he is working hard and the door is definitely not closed			0
when we name a larger squad of 45 in the summer to start preparing for the @entity52 , he has got a big chance of being part of that			0
' @entity56 forward @entity0 , though , said he that he made up his mind before @entity59 that he would step down from the international scene if he failed to make the @entity6 cut			1
' i was gutted to miss out on the autumn , ' @entity0 told the @entity63			2
' i told myself then that i would train as hard as i can and get as fit as i can			0
if it did n't happen , then i 'll call it a day			0
' @entity0 ( right ) and @entity66 ( left ) celebrate @entity6 success he added : ' it 's obviously not the way i would want to finish , it 's not how i planned it in my head , and i hope no - one thinks i am simply quitting			1
' @entity0 pointed to the disappointments of being dropped for the match against @entity75 at the end of last year 's @entity6 , and his ' 30 - minute match ' in @entity78 in the summer , when he was replaced by @entity25 after half an hour			1
that 38 - 16 first @entity14 defeat against @entity78 in @entity80 last summer has transpired to be @entity0 ' 95th and final game for his country			1
he is , though , set to continue playing for the @entity56			0
@entity0 was part of the side that secured a @entity86 quarter - final place on saturday by defeating @entity87 28 - 3 in @entity88			2
@entity0 , meanwhile , said he had no issue with @entity5 , beyond believing he still should be in the @entity1 squad			1
' @entity5 is the man who came in and saved me , he gave me a kick up the ( backside ) , so he has been a massive influence on me , and i 'm very grateful , ' @entity0 added			2
' i do n't agree with what he 's done now , i do n't agree with him not picking me			0
but he 's got to pick who he thinks is best			0
