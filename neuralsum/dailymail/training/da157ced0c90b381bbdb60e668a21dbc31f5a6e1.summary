@entity1 chief executive @entity0 said emergency measures are in place across @entity4 to avoid blackouts this winter emergency measures are needed to ensure @entity4 avoids blackouts this winter , the @entity1 boss has admitted			1
chief executive @entity0 said old power stations could be brought out of mothballs to supply extra energy			1
a number of coal - fired power stations have been shut to satisfy @entity15 targets for cutting greenhouse gases			1
four nuclear plants have closed unexpectedly for repairs – although mr @entity0 said two may be ready by the end of the year			1
the result is the total amount of electricity that can be supplied could be just 5 per cent greater than demand from consumers			1
@entity1 has commissioned firms to bring mothballed power plants back into operation , and will pay manufacturers to turn off machines on peak afternoons			1
some £ 75million has been set aside for this over the next two winters , money that will be added to customers ' bills			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ margins are tighter than they were last winter , which were tighter than they were the year before			1
the reality is that a lot of our power stations are old			2
' we are taking a lot of coal fired stations off and we need to build a lot of new generation capacity in the @entity4			1
’ he said : ‘ a number of generators in the @entity4 have been retiring and shutting and we have had a number of operational issues in plants around the @entity4			2
different power stations are – at the moment – unavailable to us			0
‘ we are just taking the right steps to make sure we know we have got the capacity to balance supply and demand this winter			0
’ mr @entity0 said there is good reason to believe that nuclear power stations at @entity64 and @entity65 , which are currently shut down for safety checks and repairs , will come back on line by the end of the year , which will ease the problem			1
but , he said : ‘ we are making sure that we have commercial arrangements in place with generators that have shut down at the moment and are not available to us , to potentially come back on line and support the system if we get a very cold , sharp winter			1
‘ this is about trying to manage the coldest , darkest day of the year not average demand			0
’ mr @entity0 , who was speaking on the @entity80 radio 4 today programme , said @entity1 is a ‘ long long way ’ from the need to have a conversation about whose lights would have to be turned off			2
‘ we are just making sure that we have back up supplies in a prudent way , so that we can see ourselves through a cold winter			0
’ mr @entity0 said the measures will prevent the lights going out , adding : ‘ there are lots of tools available to us			2
we are being very prudent , very careful , but i ’m confident that with these tools we will be able to balance supply and demand this winter			0
’ a number of coal - fired power stations , pictured , have been shut to satisfy @entity15 targets for cutting greenhouse gases while four nuclear plants have closed unexpectedly for repairs ( file pic ) he said the government passed a new @entity104 last year which has created a series of incentives to encourage energy companies to build the power stations , including nuclear and wind farms , that will supply needed electricity in the future			1
but it raises the spectre of 1970s - style blackouts			0
the @entity116 said managers had ‘ failed to plan adequately ’			0
big business argue the energy crunch is a damning indictment of the way the nation ’s electricity supply system has been managed by successive governments and regulators			0
director of the @entity127 , @entity128 , said : ‘ this can ’ t be sustainable way of managing the energy system			0
industry has to have access to secure power supplies			0
‘ how are we supposed to expect investment to continue into this country if we are in danger of moving toward having @entity140 levels of reliability for power ? the @entity116 said radical action is needed to ensure homes and businesses have all the power they need			0
dr @entity147 , its executive director of policy and external affairs , said : ‘ for too long , the @entity4 has failed to plan adequately to guarantee the energy supplies required for our economy , businesses and consumers			0

coal - fired stations were shut to meet @entity15 targets on greenhouse *emissions*
four nuclear plants closed unexpectedly for repairs - but two *due* to *reopen*
electricity supplied could be just 5 *%* more than demand from customers
@entity0 said firms had been commissioned to bring plants back to use
