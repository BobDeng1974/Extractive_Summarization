with @entity1 bearing down on the @entity2 , thousands of people face fleeing their homes			2
but , as ever , there is one group of intrepid individuals heading straight for @entity7 - the weathermen			2
as a reminder to us all , tv stations and blogs have compiled a series of clips which remind us that the job of forecasting the weather can have dangers of its own			0
one of the clips shows an unidentified weatherman swear live on air when some lightning flashes across the sky			1
. ! ’ he says , oblivious to the fact he is still on camera			1
‘ did you see that ? ’ in other footage a weather girl shrieks when her cap is blown off and runs after it whilst still on air			1
fail : @entity27 's @entity51 fell over in 2005 during severe gusts from @entity20 in @entity53 , @entity54 , despite a colleague grabbing his legs to keep him steady almost blown away : this weather reporter in @entity58 struggles to hold onto her thermal hat as she is battered by strong winds and another clip shows a weather girl being held up by a colleague as wind batters them both			1
she tells viewers : ‘ it ’s just painful ’ - before they are both swept away			1
among the most famous weather ‘ fails ’ is that of @entity27 ’s @entity51 , who fell over on camera due to high winds			1
in a clip from 2005 he at first seems to be coping with the gusts from @entity20 in @entity53 , @entity54 with the aid of a colleague grabbing his legs to keep him steady			0
hats off : this reporter in @entity80 remarks about a fallen traffic light before she loses her hat and hilariously runs after it with her back to the camera sea breeze : this reporter amazingly escapes unharmed while there is debris blowing all around him as he reports on @entity90 but moments into the broadcast he slips up and falls on his side			1
‘ we ’re ok , we ’re ok , ’ he said as he hauled himself indoors with a grin on his face			0
the year before mr @entity51 already assured his place in the weatherman hall of fame when he apparently stumbled across a reporter making a live broadcast in @entity101 , @entity54 , and decided to lend him a hand			1
the footage shows @entity24 ’s @entity104 being held up by mr @entity51 as the two lean into the 70mph wind - and get rather too close for comfort			1
toppled : during @entity90 in 2008 , a @entity24 anchor was swept by a gust of wind into bushes while he was delivering a report ' @entity113 hug ' : @entity27 's @entity51 helped @entity24 reporter @entity114 in need of assistance in 2004 in @entity101 , @entity54 ‘ you know i ’m glad you showered this morning , @entity51 ’ said mr @entity104			1
‘ you know , we ought to just lay down			0
' in another clip from 2008 a @entity24 reporter was blown into a shrub mid-broadcast			0
the hilarious footage shows the the man tumble onto his side and land in a bush due to the force of @entity90			2
with admirable dedication to the cause he says into his microphone : ‘ hold on ’ as he is upended and thrown onto a plant			0
test run : @entity136 's @entity135 decided to show viewers how 130mph winds really feel on a person , with an experiment at the @entity141 he then gets up and resumes his broadcast as if nothing had happened , saying : ‘ alright , sorry about that , that was a heck of a gust ’			2
veteran weatherman @entity21 also fell victim to @entity20 in 2005 which left him barely able to move			0
‘ woah ! very hard to stand , ’ he says in the footage , which has been posted on @entity151			0
he adds : ‘ just the power of the hurricane ’ as he is forced to bend at a 45 degree angle to stand up			0
‘ wow , that ’s some of the strongest wind i ’ve ever had to stand in ’			2
