the unemployment rate rose in october to 7.9 per cent according to the latest @entity3 @entity2 report – raising it above the level when president @entity6 was sworn into office in january 2009			1
shortly after taking office , @entity6 said that if he failed to revive the economy in three years , he would be looking at a ‘ one - term proposition ’			1
the september jobs report came as major a surprise with unemployment rate dropping to 7.8 per cent , dipping below eight per cent for the first time since february 2009 , when it was 8.3 per cent			1
delicate moment : president @entity6 speaks at a rally in @entity17 yesterday during the fraught run - up to the election on inauguration day in 2009 , unemployment was 7.8 per cent			1
employers added 171,000 jobs , with the overall rate rising because more people began looking for work			1
if the labour force participation rate was the same as when @entity6 took office , however , unemployment would be 10.6 per cent			2
progress ? the rate of unemployment has fluctuated over the past two years , but is still higher than it was when @entity6 took office on the campaign trail , however , @entity6 has pleaded for more time			1
‘ we 've made real progress these past four years , ’ he said in @entity36 , @entity37 on thursday night			1
‘ but , @entity37 , we all know our work is not yet done			0
as long as there 's a single @entity3 who wants a job and ca n't find one , our work is not done			0
’ it was the last monthly employment report before a general election on tuesday that has largely been fought on the issue of jobs with @entity48 , the @entity49 nominee , blasting @entity6 for the ailing economy and @entity6 blaming the situation on the ‘ mess ’ he inherited from president @entity53			1
while most voters have made up their mind about the economy , and many have already cast their ballots early , the rise in the unemployment rate will give @entity48 potentially crucial ammunition in the final four days of the 2012 campaign			1
the september jobs report was greeted with scepticism and even claims of conspiracy from some on the @entity67			0
@entity68 , former ceo of @entity69 , said via @entity70 : ‘ unbelievable jobs numbers … these @entity73 guys will do anything.ca n’t debate so change numbers			2
’ there was no immediate reaction from @entity78 , whose comments ignited a firestorm and were denounced by the @entity81 as ‘ ludicrous ’ , to the october report			0
@entity48 said that the ‘ increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill ’			1
he added in a statement : ‘ the jobless rate is higher than it was when president @entity6 took office , and there are still 23million @entity3 struggling for work			1
crucial time : @entity49 candidate @entity48 , pictured today arriving in @entity94 , @entity95 , said the increase in the unemployment rate was ' a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill ¿ since president @entity6 took office four years ago , 67 per cent , or two - thirds , of new jobs have gone to legal and illegal immigrants , according to a new report from the @entity105			1
most of that growth in immigrant employment was due to new immigrants coming to the @entity3 for work rather than immigrants already living in the country			0
there were 1.94million more immigrants employed in the third quarter of 2012 than at the start of 2009 , when the president took office , compared with 938,000 hires among native citizens in the same time period			2
a large share of job growth was going to immigrants before @entity6 took office , but the president has taken steps to make it easier for foreign - born workers to land jobs in the @entity3 in 2010 the @entity6 administration called on the @entity3 @entity132 to drop @entity134 ’s immigration law requiring employers to verify the legal status of new workers			2
the @entity132 delivered a 5 - 3 decision upholding the law in 2011			0
‘ on tuesday , @entity3 will make a choice between stagnation and prosperity			0
for four years , president @entity6 ’s policies have crushed @entity3 ’s middle class			0
‘ for four years , president @entity6 has told us that things are getting better and that we ’re making progress			2
for too many @entity3 families , those words ring hollow			0
‘ we can do better			0
we can have real economic growth , create millions of good - paying jobs , and give middle - class families the security and opportunity they deserve			2
‘ when i ’m president , i ’m going to make real changes that lead to a real recovery , so that the next four years are better than the last			2
’ job gains in previous months grew after being revised , with september ’s 114,000 new jobs revised to 148,000 while august ’s 142,000 was revised to 192,000			0
there have now been 25 consecutive months of jobs gains in the @entity3 – something trumpeted by the @entity6 campaign - but the increases have been not been enough to absorb new people entering the work force			0
about 12million people are without work , two out of five of whom have been out of a job for more than six months .			0
