@entity0 is adamant the @entity1 is not to blame for @entity2 delivering what might be their worse season for nine years			1
perhaps the goalkeeper would have been better off hiding behind conventional wisdom , considering the disappointment of this elongated campaign which could yet see @entity2 finish in the bottom half of the @entity11 for the first time since 2006			1
those prospects are dwindling , courtesy of a four - game unbeaten run , but there is no mistaking that @entity20 ’s side have fallen way below the standards set last season			2
the gap between their status now and after 32 games last season is 25 points , the difference between targeting a @entity30 place and chasing the top 10			2
@entity0 is adamant the @entity1 is not to blame for @entity2 's poor season in the @entity11 the @entity34 outfit played 10 games in @entity36 this season before being knocked out by @entity38 @entity39 scored for @entity2 at @entity40 but the game ended in a 1 - 1 draw at the @entity43 @entity40 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity44 6.5 ; @entity45 6 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 6 ; ki 6.5 , @entity49 6.5 , @entity50 7.5 ( @entity51 83mins ) ; @entity52 6 , @entity53 6 ( @entity54 17 , 6.5 ) , @entity55 6.5			1

@entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity0 6.5 ; @entity63 6 , stones 6 , @entity64 6.5 , @entity65 6.5 ; @entity66 6.5 , @entity67 7 ; @entity39 6.5 , @entity68 5.5 ( @entity69 86 ) , @entity70 6 ( @entity71 28 , 6 ) ; @entity72 5 ( @entity73 76 )			1

the demands of playing 10 games in the @entity1 have certainly taken their toll but @entity0 rejected that theory , saying : ‘ that ’s something that ’s been talked about for the last five or 10 years but it ’s just a blanket statement people make			1
@entity30 teams have to do the same thing			0
‘ they play wednesday and saturday and it ’s tough but no - one blames @entity30 football			2
every football team does not have a god given right to be anywhere			0
‘ we ’ve put in honest performances but things just have n’t gone our way			0
we could sit here and make a list of a thousand different things but it ’s not the @entity1 or anything else			0
’ the perception that luck has not gone @entity2 ’s way extended to saturday when @entity39 ’s first - half strike was cancelled out by a @entity50 penalty			1
@entity20 was incensed by the award of a penalty though it appeared a reasonable decision			0
neither side came out of the fixture unscathed , with @entity70 of @entity2 and @entity40 ’s @entity53 due to have scans today on respective groin and hamstring injuries			1
@entity0 will not allow @entity36 to be an excuse for what could be @entity2 's worst season in nine years @entity50 of @entity40 scores past @entity0 with a penalty to level the scores on saturday afternoon @entity40 manager @entity128 confirmed a striker is top of his summer wishlist after being left with no fit front men , while @entity2 , in the shorter - term , have been told to finish in the top half			1
@entity0 added : ‘ there ’s a points total we want to achieve and get ourselves in the top half of the table			1
’ super stat : @entity2 named an unchanged team in the league for the first time since march 2014 against @entity142			2
@entity20 will hope that after such a good campaign last time he does not get an unwanted record			0

@entity2 drew 1 - 1 with @entity40 at the @entity43 on saturday
they could finish @entity11 bottom half for first time in nine years
@entity0 says his side 's *struggles* are *n't* down to @entity1
*toffees* played 10 @entity156 games but @entity0 says form is down to luck
