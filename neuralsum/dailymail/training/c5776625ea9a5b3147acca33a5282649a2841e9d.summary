’ former pirate radio dj @entity3 watched the boy walk past his apartment to a shop to buy a fizzy drink , then lay in wait for him to return			1
after grabbing him from behind and warning him he would die if he did not keep quiet , @entity3 marched the boy back to his housing association flat , bound him with rope and duct - tape and shoved him into an airing cupboard with a pillow case over his head			1
@entity3 , 50 , is then said to have groped the boy , repeatedly threatening to kill him if he made a noise			1
the terrified child was found more than three hours later – naked from the waist down and begging for help – after he managed to free some of his bonds to shuffle to a window when @entity3 went out			1
he was seen by a family friend who had been helping to search for him , and told them : ‘ i ’ve been kidnapped , the man ’s gone and left me			0
’ twice - married @entity3 was arrested later that day at the home of a friend where he had gone to play computer games			1
police believe he had left his flat in @entity39 , @entity40 – which was run by a housing association which works to help resettle ex-offenders – to build himself an alibi with the intention of returning later to molest the boy			2
just four days before the kidnap last november , @entity3 had failed in an attempt to snatch the same child , who lived 250 yards from his flat , chasing him to his front door			2
while police were investigating the second incident , a ten - year - old girl came forward to reveal how two months earlier , @entity3 had lured her to his flat to look at his goldfish and , under the pretext of a ‘ cops and robbers game ’ , tied her up before photographing her			1
although no sexual assault took place , prosecutors believe @entity3 ’s motives had been @entity61 , who has at least one grown - up child , has a criminal history stretching back to 1976 with 20 convictions for 73 offences			2

in 1981 he was given a two - year probation order after taking a woman off the street to a secluded building and molesting her			1
in 1983 , he lured a 13 - year - old girl into his tower block flat with the offer of stroking his puppy before grabbing her at knifepoint , bolting the door and tying her up with her own roller boot laces			1
@entity3 , 50 , at his wedding in 1995 @entity3 was then known as @entity93 – he later changed his name to impress his second wife , who was a fan of pop star @entity3 – and living in @entity96 , three miles from @entity39			1
he stripped and gagged the girl before simulating sex and forcing her to touch him			0
later that year he was sentenced to 30 months for kidnap , indecent assault and breach of his probation order			0
last night , his victim told the @entity104 : ‘ i was petrified			0
he kept me there for seven hours			0
‘ i swear the only reason i got out of there alive was by promising to be his girlfriend for the rest of my life			0
i told him i ’d go back to visit him the next day			0
eventually he let me go			0
’ coincidentally , the woman lives just streets away from the boy who was snatched in the most recent attack			0
she added : ‘ my mum had a sick feeling that whoever kidnapped that boy was also my attacker			0
she thought she ’d seen him on his bike around here not so long ago			0
‘ @entity3 should n’t have been allowed to live anywhere near me			2
just like that little boy , i ’m lucky to be here to tell the tale			0
’ at court in may , @entity3 admitted abducting the ten - year - old girl , as well as kidnapping , falsely imprisoning and sexually assaulting the boy , along with kidnap with intent to commit a sexual offence			1
but reporting restrictions prevented his identification until the conclusion of a trial over the alleged kidnap and indecent assault of another woman			2
the restrictions were lifted yesterday after the prosecution decided not to proceed with that case			2
@entity3 , who will be sentenced later this month , was arrested last november after the boy was found at his ground - floor flat forensics as they searched the flat at the time of the kidnapping			1
@entity155 decorations are seen hanging in the window at @entity158 , judge @entity157 adjourned sentencing over the offences against the two ten - year - olds until later this month			1
barristers said the judge could decide to hand @entity3 an indeterminate sentence for public protection – meaning he would be released only if he was considered to pose no further threat			0
last night , detective chief inspector @entity166 , who led the police investigation , said @entity3 was a ‘ dangerous offender ’ , adding that his actions had had a ‘ massive impact ’ on the two ten - year - olds			1
a spokesman for @entity172 , which runs the block where @entity3 was living , said it had been closed and was being sold to another housing association .			0
