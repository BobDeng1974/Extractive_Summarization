@entity0 has been with me for the past 50 years and @entity2 for 47			2
neither is the man i am married to , nor have i seen or spoken to either since our love affairs ended in my 20s			1
all the same , there is no denying they have both messed with my marriage to @entity10 , the man who has been by my side for the past 40 years			1
i found myself thinking about them both as i read recent research that suggested women who played the field before marriage are unhappier with their lot than those who entered matrimony virginal			0
@entity19 has often questioned what life would have been like had she married another man my first reaction was : why on earth would that be ? i have always believed a bit of experience , in both love and sex , to be an asset to understanding what we really want when selecting a partner for life			1
having no history to draw on — settling down with no idea what else the world has to offer — seems a recipe for disaster , not satisfaction			0
and yet there is no denying that my past lovers have made their presence felt in my marriage — at times , even making me question my commitment			1
@entity10 and i have , along with a lot of fun , weathered many disagreements , and even contemplated separation after a mid-life hiccup saw all passion wilt			1
although we ’re still together , would @entity10 and i have been happier , our journey to this point easier , had he been my one and only ? not that i had notched up a great many scalps on my bedpost before we met when i was 29 — but there were a few , and , most significantly , @entity0 and @entity2 were both serious contenders for my heart			1
although my relationships with the two ended very differently — i left @entity0 in @entity64 for a job in @entity66 when i was 24 , with great pain ; @entity2 found fidelity too hard and broke my heart by ending our 18 - month affair abruptly — they both left me with an undeniably tantalising sense of ‘ what if ’			0
neither maintained any physical presence in my life , but memories of how good things had been with them at our best always lived at the back of my mind , like old love letters or black - and - white photographs gathered at the bottom of a box			1
they faded during the early years with @entity10 , and were covered over by fresh memories made with him			1
we were absorbed in our new - found love , revelling in the unearthing of shared interests and enjoying our sexual chemistry , leaving no room for thoughts of anyone else in my mind			0
so it is for many women in the early years after they tie the knot			0
but , as time passes , things change			0
the early days of romantic enchantment tend not to be the stuff of life ever after			2
evenings channelling @entity103 and counting the ways we love each other are displaced — particularly after the arrival of children — by the urgency of deciding whether to replace the boiler , or whose turn it is to make dinner			0
all such things can bind us together , weaving tightly the tough fabric of a joined life			2
but the danger of life ’s predictable routine — the groundhog day familiarity , talking to each other so matter - of - factly , being sparing with the compliments — lies in allowing the mind to wander			2
@entity19 with her former lover @entity0			1
she says there is no denying that her past lovers have made their presence felt in her marriage — at times , even making her question her commitment to husband @entity10 it is at such times that women , far more than men , according to @entity136 , @entity137 psychologist and author of women who think too much , are likely to find themselves ruminating on how life might have panned out with the past loves that seemed so magical in their time			1
whether the thrill might have endured and could have made for an infinitely more satisfying relationship than the one we have now			2
these fantasies , as i see it , are like powerful ghosts , haunting the darker recesses of our psyche , ready to swoop in and cause trouble , when given the chance			0
certainly , my marriage became crowded with ghosts when , after my first decade with @entity10 , the little things that had once been no more than niggles began to take on greater significance			1
we seemed too often to slip on to opposite tracks			0
arguments and irritation replaced amiable conversation , sex felt more a chore than a delight , we were frequently exhausted by raising our two , growing sons while doing up a wreck of a house			1
@entity171 felt more a chore than a delight with husband @entity10 , and they were exhausted by raising two , growing sons while doing up a wreck of a house all that had been so loveable in our partnership — impromptu , romantic weekends away , gifts given on whim , hugs whenever we passed on the stairs , conversations peppered with unsolicited ‘ i love yous ’ — had been replaced by a tetchy co-existence			1
after one explosive row — undoubtedly over something banal , such as @entity10 not paying sufficient attention to what i was saying — i took myself for a walk and , suddenly , it was as though @entity0 were there : tall and angular , his long legs striding beside mine , his deep , drawling voice asking me what was wrong , telling me how he desired me , his intelligent face breaking often into a broad smile			1
once the gates had opened , the happy memories came in a flood			2
i remembered the hurt , baby pigeon we had adopted in a shared fit of impulsive sentimentality , and nursed back to flight			0
the novels he presented me with , filled with flowers he had pressed himself			0
the bottle of bubbles he had opened , apropos of nothing but his insistence that it was time to celebrate us			0
the evenings spent making passionate love			0
memories so powerful , so tangible that i felt an urgent yearning to be back in that time and his arms			1
@entity19 with her husband @entity10 , who she says was crowded out by memories of her past lovers why oh why had we let the relationship go ? surely the fault lines had not been so great			1
i found myself ruminating on these memories over the days and weeks ahead , so that they became more real , more powerful , each time i conjured them up			2
@entity0 began to appear whenever i was feeling low , sad or undervalued — he would have known how to soothe me , i felt , when to say sweet things that answered my longing to feel there was someone to lean on , to be looked after by			2
at other times , when @entity10 and i had been in a sexual drought zone , @entity2 would come sweeping in			1
he had been one of those emotionally dangerous men of huge charisma and puckish good looks			0
he never quite felt reliable , yet gave me the intoxicating sense of inhabiting a private world , in which his penetrating , green eyes , teasing smile and utter absorption in our love were all that existed			2
although he ended our affair abruptly and cruelly — in a way that i now suspect would have been repeated in other ways in a real life together — tantalising memories pay no heed to reality			1
carefully edited by my subconscious , they left out his not - so - perfect moments and presented me only with the steamy ingredients that seemed to be missing from my marriage			0
such rumination seems a particularly female trait			0
why do past loves not torment men in the same way ? @entity10 has ex-girlfriends he talks of warmly and with amusement , at times , but i have never felt he was inviting in the ghosts as i do — they are over and done with , locked away where they can do no harm			1
relate counsellor @entity280 believes men are more inclined to take a practical approach to the past			2
‘ they can put emotional things into a box and shut down the lid so nothing seeps out into everyday life , ’ she says			0
‘ women can do a lot of good to their relationships by focusing on emotional needs and confronting them			0
‘ but letting fantasies take over can be a way of avoiding a problem that needs sorting out in a real - life marriage			0
‘ are the fantasies telling you what is missing in your present relationship that you could work on ? ’ once @entity19 stopped inviting her ghosts in , they seemed to fade away my ghosts were undoubtedly crowding @entity10 out			1
adrift in our marriage , getting on each other ’s nerves , i knew i needed to do some hard thinking of a different kind			0
slipping so easily into ruminations and ‘ what ifs ’ was , i realised , a destructive self - indulgence , which stopped me making any real effort to unweave the unhappy web we were caught in			0
i was so focused on how @entity10 did n’t match up that i was n’t wondering whether i did			1
i had to grow up and let go , if our marriage was going to hold strong			0
i started by refusing to give the thoughts of @entity0 and @entity321 when they appeared , and forcing my mind to something else			0
i laughed at @entity10 ’s criticisms more often than i flared up ; i made a point of talking about how i valued all we had built up together , what good friends we were , and how i relished spending shared time enjoying our grandchildren			1
i was surprised by how well this worked , how once i stopped inviting my ghosts in , they seemed to fade away , and how @entity10 , in turn , became softer , less critical , more able to acknowledge how much we mattered to each other			1
i am not sentimental enough to say we now have the perfect relationship , nor that @entity2 and @entity0 will never again get a nostalgic thought			0
there are times , even now , when i wish @entity10 were as artfully charming as @entity0 , or as dangerously seductive as @entity2			1
but , while i would not wish away my past , i no longer imagine that it holds anyone who would have been a better bet than my husband			2
i can see clearly that his steady , reliable form of love , while not as demonstrative , has infinitely more value and will help us weather many more years together yet			0
as we snuggle up in bed , our books on our knees , laughing at how cosy this feels after 40 shared years , i am glad that i allowed @entity10 ’s substantial self to banish my ghosts			2
