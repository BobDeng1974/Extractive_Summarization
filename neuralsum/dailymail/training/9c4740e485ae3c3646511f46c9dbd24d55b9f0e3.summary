the former bank boss caught buying crystal meth and crack cocaine has been suspended from the @entity3 as @entity4 faced questions over hiring him as an advisor			1
@entity7 , a @entity8 minister who was chairman of the @entity9 when it ran into trouble , now faces an investigation by the police after being covertly filmed counting off £ 20 notes to buy hard drugs			1
today the @entity16 has launched a fact - finding investigation into ' any inappropriate behaviour ' at the group or the @entity9 and a ' root - and - branch review ' of the structure of the organisation			1
caught on camera : the @entity24 was filmed counting money for a drugs deal until june @entity27 was £ 132,000 - a - year chairman of the ‘ ethical ’ bank , which has lent £ 34million to @entity3 over two decades			1
the @entity3 today moved to distance itself from @entity27 , suspending the former city councillor for bringing the party into ‘ disrepute ’			1
at the weekend he apologised ‘ to all i have hurt or failed by my actions ’ over the revelations in the @entity38 involving crystal meth , crack cocaine and ketamine			1
he bragged of getting ‘ wasted ’ following his grilling by @entity41 over the near - collapse of the bank			1
as the scale of the @entity9 ’s financial problems emerged this year , @entity7 stepped down as chairman and as deputy chairman of the @entity16			1
the bank lost £ 700million in the first six months of the year and a £ 1.5billion black hole was discovered in its finances			1
as well as being suspended by the @entity3 , he has also been suspended by the @entity52			1
now the @entity16 has launched an inquiry into any ' inappropriate behaviour ' at the bank or the wider group			1
the co-operative group said in a statement : ' given the serious and wide - ranging nature of recent allegations , the new executive management team has started a fact - finding process to look into any inappropriate behaviour at the @entity16 or the @entity9 and to take action as necessary			2
' in addition , the board of the @entity16 has launched a root and branch review of the democratic structure of the organisation			2
' we need to modernise to ensure that the interests of all our seven million members are properly and directly represented in the oversight of our business activities			2
' labour leader @entity4 defended hiring @entity27 to advise him on finance and industry it is embarrassing for mr @entity4 , who in 2010 appointed flowers as a member of @entity3 ’s influential finance and industry advisory board			2
@entity7 has been a @entity8 minister for almost 40 years and served as a @entity3 councillor on @entity83 , where he lives , for a decade			1
today mr @entity4 defended bringing flowers into the party fold : ‘ he was involved in the co-op and that is no longer the case			1
i think we will leave it there			2
‘ you appoint people from a whole range of backgrounds to look at a whole range of issues and we have a range of business people working with us			0
‘ the police are looking into the matter and i 'm not going to comment on an ongoing investigation			1
’ flowers bragged of getting ' wasted ' following his grilling by mps over the near - collapse of the bank , which threatens the retirement income of thousands of pensioners a @entity3 spokesman added : ‘ in the light of recent reports , we have today suspended @entity7 as a member of the @entity3 for bringing the party into disrepute			1
’ @entity7 has already been suspended by the @entity52			1
@entity117 last night confirmed they had begun an inquiry into possible criminal charges against @entity7 , who has gone into hiding			1
the scandal is an acute embarrassment for @entity3 and its 32 mps who are sponsored by the @entity16			2
shadow chancellor @entity125 has received £ 50,000 in donations from the co-op , which prides itself on its ethical stance			0
ordinarily , the @entity24 would have presided over the 10.30am service yesterday at @entity130			0
the gathering at the modern pebble - dashed church outside @entity83 , @entity134 , lasts an hour and is followed by tea and biscuits			0
but having been caught buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth , crack cocaine and ketamine , it would hardly have seemed appropriate to take the pulpit			1
ridicule : the @entity27 during the @entity145 hearing the @entity52 appears to agree – @entity7 has been suspended from his duties for three weeks			1
he has been one of its ministers for 40 years			0
laudable , you might say			0
but does being in such a post really make one a suitable candidate to become chairman of the @entity9 ? was there something else in @entity7 ’s cv that qualified him for this most demanding of positions ? well , to be fair , the openly gay @entity7 did work for @entity158 for four years , in the late 60s			1
the position he held is not clear , but given the fact that he was 19 at the time and became a @entity8 minister at the end of his tenure suggests the post was not a senior one			2
at a meeting of the @entity145 earlier this month , when asked to explain how he was qualified to run the bank following its £ 700million loss he replied : ‘ i took the exam of the @entity168			2
‘ i completed part one and the best part of part two of those exams before i became a @entity8 minister			2
‘ i would judge that experience is out of date in terms of the needs of contemporary banking			0
’ who would argue with that ? especially given his somewhat shaky grasp of figures			0
he told the committee that the co-op ’s balance sheet had £ 3billion of assets , when the answer was in fact £ 47billion			0
he was also at a loss to answer questions about the amount of loans on its books			0
perhaps there is some other evidence of financial wizardry , then , in his background ? yesterday the @entity38 searched long and hard , but could find nothing			0
@entity7 was born in @entity204 to parents @entity205 and @entity207 but has lived in the @entity208 for many years			1
his father died in 1993 aged 70 , and he had a brother , @entity210 , who died the same year aged just 39			0
he lives in a modest house in @entity83 and shared it with his mother until her death last year aged 85			0
mr @entity7 lives in a modest house in @entity83 and shared it with his mother until her death last year aged 85 after that brief stint with the @entity158 , he became a minister with the @entity52 , for whom he now sits as a trustee on the body that manages its invested funds and property			1
twenty or so years ago , @entity7 came to attention as vice-chairman of @entity228 ’s social services committee during the ‘ satanic abuse ’ fiasco between 1988 and 1991			1
it involved social workers making lurid claims about satanic rituals being performed on children and , as a result , 20 children from six families were placed in care			0
however , the police found no evidence and a government - backed inquiry subsequently blamed ‘ evangelical @entity244 ’ for the scare			2
flowers maintained a high profile , sitting on committees and getting himself involved in community projects			0
ironically , given recent events , from 1992 to 2004 he was prominently involved with the @entity252 , which helps drug abusers			2
today he remains a trustee of the @entity255 , the hiv / aids charity			0
speaking about his involvement with the charity , he once said : ‘ as an out gay man for all of my adult life i am acutely aware of the issues surrounding @entity262			0
‘ like many others i have been personally affected by it in ways which are often far too painful to recount			0
’ @entity266 @entity7 was a councillor at @entity83 for ten years but does not appear to have been universally popular			1
one former councillor told the @entity38 yesterday : ‘ @entity7 was an insufferable and pompous man who threw his not inconsiderable weight around			1
' he always made it plain he was the most educated person in a room and everyone else was a peasant			0
’ in 2010 – more irony – he was appointed by @entity3 leader @entity4 to the party ’s finance and industry board			2
none of this goes any way to explain just how @entity7 became chairman of the proudly ethical @entity9			1
but it seems the system by which the appointment was made goes some way to solving the mystery			0
flowers rose through the co-op ’s ranks , joining the board of the @entity16 in 2008 and becoming deputy chairman			0
in 2009 the post of chairman of @entity294 became vacant			0
choosing the candidate fell to the 13 - strong remuneration and @entity297 , which is formed largely of former @entity3 politicians and co-operative movement veterans			0
it traditionally selected directors from the board of the @entity16			0
on that board of about 20 people , you would be unlikely to find any high - flying bankers			0
or anyone , it seems , remotely up to the job of running a bank			2
the school leaver who worked at @entity158 40 years previously was the best they could find .			0
