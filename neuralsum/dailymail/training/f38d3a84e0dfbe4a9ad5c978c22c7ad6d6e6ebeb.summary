empty glass bottles , cardboard boxes , discarded appliances and pieces of old wooden furniture lay piled up in the front yard to nearly half the height of the house itself			1
a ginger cat crawls over and picks through plastic bags full of rubbish , old paint tins , a rusted wheelbarrow and a suitcase and the gates almost burst at the seams holding back the mountains of trash			0
located in @entity19 's beachside suburb of @entity20 , arguably one of @entity21 's most sought after areas at less than a kilometre from the iconic @entity24 , the house has not been lived in by its occupants for years			1
for at least two decades this property has caused trouble for infuriated neighbours who have to deal with the stench and the sight of rubbish inexplicably piled up in every spare space outside and presumably inside this home			1
although this is not the first time it 's riled up people in the area , and the council cleaned the property just six months ago , some neighbours said the house is as bad as they 've ever seen it , describing it as ' sickening ' and ' filth '			2
bits of old wooden furniture , empty cans and tins and deflated sporting equipment can all be found among the mountains of rubbish locals and many passersby often stop to stare at the objects piling up in the front of the @entity42 house the front gate and fence can barely contain the trash which fills the front yard and covers the front porch one woman , who lived nearby but had two friends living on the street said she had been completely baffled by the state of the home for years , and revealed that residents were outraged about the state of the place			1
' i do n't understand , i just do n't understand it , ' she told @entity92			0
' it 's unbelievable , it 's outrageous			0
' it 's not fair for people who live nearby and want to sell property ... i just do n't understand why the council ca n't do anything about it , ' she continued			2
@entity102 , one of @entity31 's two daughters is pictured here in april sitting defiantly guarding her piles of trash inexplicably , the side of the house and path leading down in to the backyard is much cleaner with hardly any items littering the ground one neighbour said people often come and go from the house but the residents are sometimes not seen there for days at a time another woman who has lived next door to the rotting property - which has trees growing through the roof and holes in the walls - for the past 15 years said ' they have n't lived inside the house for years ' , and she believed there was no running water or electricity			1
' they 've got away with it for the last 20 years and they 'll probably get away with it for another 20 years ' , she added , speaking of the very public squalor @entity31 and her two daughters were living in			2
the woman said sometimes the @entity137 would n't been seen at their home for days at a time , while another added she had seen one of the family members arriving home with piles of new objects			2
a ginger cat has made a home for itself among the piles of cardboard boxes and old plastic containers one neighbour described the @entity33 family as ' nocturnal ' and said they found one of the women going through her rubbish two doors down from the squalid house another neighbour said the situation used to bother her , her husband and their small children but now ' it 's just sad '			1
' the council cleans it up every so often but there 's an underlying mental issue ... cleaning wo n't fix it , it 's sad , ' she said			0
' the council have been brilliant , they send residents letters to keep us updated and hold meetings about the house			0
the street is one of the most expensive in @entity20 , located just a kilometre from iconic @entity24 ' ( but ) it 's sickening because it 's prime real estate , ' the neighbour added			1
the woman described the @entity33 family as ' nocturnal ' recounting one evening when she returned home from an evening out to discover one of the women going through her rubbish bin , who when asked what they were doing simply said they were searching for something they had lost			0
' my husband and i have joked about offering them $ 50,000 for the place ' , she added , before saying it did upset her that the home owners were quite clearly struggling with some form of mental illness			0
plastic bags full of garbage , slabs of wood , what looks to be old carpet samples and cardboard boxes litter the front of the house			0
