@entity1 @entity0 has agreed to join the @entity2 in the summer on a two - year deal			1
the 31 - year - old will leave the @entity1 after six years at @entity5 which saw him win two @entity8 titles and earn three caps for the @entity10 against @entity11 in 2013			1
in an impressive double coup for the @entity2 , they have also secured the services of winger @entity14 from @entity8 rivals @entity15 on a two - year deal			1
@entity0 ( top ) is to leave @entity1 after six years to join the @entity2 on a two - year deal ' during our time in the @entity8 we 've slowly looked to add quality and experience to the squad , ' @entity20 head coach @entity19 told the club 's official website			1
' sometimes that happens by developing and working with your own players and them improving over time in the @entity8 and @entity30 , but at the same time it 's also important in key positions to add quality and experience and i think that 's what @entity0 does			2
' there 's no secret that this season we have looked a bit light in the second - row department at times and @entity0 is a proven international performer			0
he adds great experience in running things like the line - out , he has got good leadership experience as well and all those things add up to it being a very good signing for us			0
the 31 - year - old won two @entity8 titles and three @entity10 caps while at @entity5 ' i 'm expecting him to have a very positive influence on and off the pitch in how he helps the team prepare for big games and his experience of what needs to be a done at a certain time			1
' @entity59 has 21 @entity61 caps but looks likely to miss the @entity63 opener against @entity64 on friday week , although @entity19 insists his fitness is not a concern			0
' as with most players we 've done a full medical and we do n't have any concerns about his physical state , ' he added			0
' he 's just like a lot of guys who get to just over 30 and have played a fair bit of rugby , there 's a few miles on the clock but physically he 's in very good condition really			0
' since their promotion to the @entity8 in 2010 the @entity2 have qualified for the @entity30 and won the @entity83 , and @entity59 does not see the move from perennial challengers @entity1 to @entity86 as a step down			1
' since @entity2 came up they 've done things in the right way , ' he said			0
@entity19 is delighted with the signings of @entity59 and @entity15 's @entity14 for 2015 - 16 season ' the first few years they stuck with the core of the squad that got them promoted and since then they 've added the odd face here and there over the years			1
there has n't been a massive turnover of players and i think that has helped them to develop as a club			0
' the @entity2 are also a lot like @entity1 , they are very much a traditional rugby club , they have a great support base and it 's a real hot - bed of rugby down there			1
' @entity19 was eager to strengthen in the backs for the 2015 - 16 season and was delighted to sign @entity14 , who he feels can bring some versatility to the dressing room			2
@entity14 ( left ) was brought into the squad to add his versatility and says he 's looking forward to the challenge ' although winger is his primary spot , he played outside centre for @entity15 against us in the @entity124 a few weeks ago , so he 's not just someone who stands on his wing and does n't come to see the ball at all , ' he said			2
' we 'll be encouraging him to come and find the ball , he 's a big , strong , physical guy , he 's tested very well in his physical tests and we 'll look to develop his game and get him as many involvements when he plays as possible			0
' @entity14 added : ' i 'm really looking forward to the challenge , i 've only ever been at @entity15 as a professional so it 's going to be good to have a change of scenery and test myself in a different environment			2
' i 've spoken to one or two players who know the club and the set - up and they all say positive things about the place and that it 's quite a tight knit group down there			0

@entity0 agrees two - year deal with the @entity2 from @entity1
the 31 - year - old spent six *successful* years at @entity5 , winning two @entity8 titles and three @entity10 caps
@entity20 boss @entity19 has *completed* an impressive double coup after also signing @entity14 from @entity8 rivals @entity15 .
