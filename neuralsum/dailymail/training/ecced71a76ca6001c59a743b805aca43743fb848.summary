defence lawyer @entity30 told @entity17 magistrates court : ' he was trying to get home			1
' he had had a @entity10 drink with his brother and it looked like a good idea			2
but a penny - farthing is not the easiest thing to return to its owner			1
' he was in drink			0
he saw the back wheel sticking out of a bush , bizarrely not the larger front wheel			0
he pedalled it to @entity17			0
at that time of year , @entity10 night , no one noticed			0
' stupidly he tried to sell it			0
' @entity47 put it on @entity25 two weeks later and it was the police who ' secured ' it for £ 75 and returned it to its owner , @entity51			1
he accepted the bid and insisted on cash and the ' buyer ' collected it from his home			2
he was nabbed and the bike returned to mr @entity51			2

but he was also in trouble for taking a motor bike along the same road and going through a red light and no entry sign as police tried to stop him			2

the bicycle received its name due to its distinctive wheels which resembled @entity98 penny and farthing coins			1
it was invented by @entity100 and was unusual because the pedals were fixed directly to the front wheel			0
the penny farthing had solid rubber wheels and a very high centre of gravity - making it very unstable and difficult to ride			1
it also did not have brakes or suspension			0
production eventually ceased in 1878			0
a new version of the historic bicycle was developed by @entity113 in 2004			0

the solicitor said : ' he went out for a drive and used the bike			2
' he was n't familiar with it and wobbled a couple of times			0
' he rode through a red light and a no entry sign at excessive speed – but it was a quiet time of day			0
