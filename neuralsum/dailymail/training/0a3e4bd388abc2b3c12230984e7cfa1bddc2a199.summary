by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 06:55 est , 7 november 2012 a species of flesh - ripping dinosaur has been named after the demonic eye of @entity4 from the @entity5 after palaeontologists classified it from just its eye - socket			0
sauroniops pachytholus - ' eye of @entity4 ' in @entity10 - was identified from a single fossil fragment of part of its upper skull found in the @entity15 region of south - east @entity16 in 2007			1
as big as a @entity18 , the beast stalked @entity19 around 95million years ago , according to a study published recently in the journal @entity22			1
fearsome : this artist 's impression shows @entity8 pachytholus in the background feeding on a young spinosaurus			2
scientists estimate that the creature was 40ft long study leader @entity29 , of the @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , said the fossil fragment used to describe the dinosaur included only part of its skull , including an eye socket			1
' the idea of a predator that is physically known only as its fierce eye reminded me of @entity4 , in particular as depicted in @entity45 's movies , ' he told @entity46			0
he and his team believe the fossil fragment belonged to a new type of carcharodontosaur , a species that includes some of the longest and heaviest known carnivorous dinosaurs			2
' @entity8 was a two - legged predator , quite similar to @entity18 in general shape , although not closely related to the latter , ' dr @entity29 told @entity55			1
piecing together the past : the fossilised fragment of skull that @entity29 and his colleagues used to identify the newly discovered dinosaur by comparing the skull fragment with fossils from related species dr @entity29 's team determined @entity66 pachytholus was 40ft long			1
however , without more fossils to go on , he admitted that it was impossible to give a precise estimate of the size of the creature			0
examination of the fossil revealed that @entity74 had a distinctive bump on its forehead , setting it apart from other creatures of the same species			0
in their paper , dr @entity29 's team speculated that this lumpy growth may have been used in head - butting clashes during mating displays			0
jigsaw identification : this image shows how the fragment would have fitted into the complete skull of the dinosaur			0
a human skull is shown for comparison the find backs up a hypothesis that there were four large species of therapods living alongside each other in that part of @entity19			1
others include @entity98 , @entity99 , and @entity100			0
' @entity8 lived along the banks of a large delta , under a hot and warm climate , very rich of fishes and crocodiles , ' dr @entity29 told @entity46			2
' the abundance of food may explain the abundance of predatory dinosaurs			1
' dr @entity29 has written about the discovery on his blog .			0

sauroniops pachytholus was one of four large predatory dinosaurs which lived in @entity19 95million years ago
scientists estimate that it was as much as 40ft long and similar in shape but *unrelated* to @entity18
