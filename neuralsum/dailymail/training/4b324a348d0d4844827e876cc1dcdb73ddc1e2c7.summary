@entity2 military officials may be staging a mass cover - up over missing flight @entity4 , because they do not want to expose gaping holes within their countries ' air defences , a leading aviation expert has suggested			1
the @entity10 jet went missing 1.30am on sunday , march 9			1
but it was n't until the following tuesday that the @entity13 @entity12 reported they had spotted the aircraft on radar over the @entity16 at 2.15am			1
now @entity18 's military say they detected a plane at 1.28am , eight minutes after @entity4 's communications went down , heading towards the @entity16 but did n't share the information because they were not asked for it			1
spotted : @entity18 military say they picked up an unidentified aircraft on radar bearing off the flight path , heading left over @entity27 and towards the @entity16 the revelation comes on a day when it emerged the captain of flight mh370 is a relative of @entity27 's jailed opposition leader			1
after previously denying he recognised the pliot 's name , opposition leader @entity33 admitted that @entity4 captain @entity4 is related to his son - in - law			1
intensive background checks on everyone aboard had turned up no - one else with a political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the plane			2
it was also revealed girlfriend of the co-pilot is holed up in a hotel with his family awaiting news of the plane 's fate			0
@entity4 , 27 , was planning to marry his girlfriend captain @entity50 , 26 , a fellow pilot from another airline			2
writing on his blog , aviation expert @entity53 said : ' maybe these states ’ air defences , like @entity27 ’s , are not what they are cracked up to be			2
' and maybe they would n’t want the rest of the world to know that			0
' mr @entity53 , a former pilot and now operations and safety editor at the respected @entity65 publication , points out that @entity4 might have flown over several @entity2 countries including @entity18 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
holding back : aviation expert @entity53 suggested some countries may be withholding radar information he said said they may be withholding vital radar data about @entity4 for fear it would expose gaping holes in their multibillion pound air defences			2
if it emerges that an unidentified aircraft had been able to fly over a territory undetected and unchallenged it would amount to an embarrassing security failure			0
regarding the @entity13 sighting mr @entity53 wrote : ' clearly they had let an unidentified aircraft pass through @entity13 sovereign territory without bothering to identify it ; not something they were happy to admit			0
' the @entity13 government has called upon all the countries to the north - west as far as @entity72 and the @entity95 to check their primary radar records for unidentified contacts in their airspace in the seven hours after the 777 went missing			2
' depending on the actual track the aircraft followed , if it had headed approximately north - west this could include some – if not all – of the following countries : @entity18 , @entity67 / @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity103 , @entity70 , @entity104 , @entity71 , @entity73 , and @entity72			1
' if the aircraft had gone that way , surely military primary radar in one of those countries – or several – would have picked up the signal from this unidentified aircraft , and the vigilant radar operator would have scrambled a fighter to intercept the intruder ? ' would n’t s / he ? or maybe not			0
maybe these states ’ air defences , like @entity27 ’s , are not what they are cracked up to be			0
and maybe they would n’t want the rest of the world to know that			0
' for the critical first three days the seach was focused on the @entity123			0
so when the @entity13 military reported the sighting over the the @entity16 , it became clear that was the wrong search area			1
the missing plane , considered history 's worst aviation disaster , went missing on march 8 with 239 people on board ' @entity133 ' , as illustrated here , is a technique used by pilots to avoid radar detection @entity136 : an @entity138 pilot scans the surface of the sea during the search operation for the missing @entity4 to the west of @entity27 today @entity13 authorities said they were ceding control to other countries in the hunt for the airliner as they announced the search area now consists of 14 huge sections covering an area the size of @entity138			1
witnesses in the @entity153 reported seeing what they described as a ' low - flying jumbo jet ' around 6.15am			1
@entity153 news website @entity156 said the residents on the remote @entity153 island of @entity160 in @entity161 said they saw a white aircraft , with red stripes across it like the planes operated by @entity10			1
it would mean that @entity4 continued for a further 2,000 miles flying westwards			0
air vice marshal @entity167 of the @entity169 said an unidentified aircraft was detected at 1.28am , eight minutes after @entity4 's transponder stopped communicating			1
he said the plane was following a twisting path , turning towards @entity175 , a @entity13 city along the @entity16			1
the radar signal was infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number			0
he said he did n't know exactly when @entity18 radar last detected the plane			2
@entity13 officials have said @entity4 was last detected by their own military radar at 2:14 a.m. heading toward the strait			1
when asked why it took so long to release the information , @entity184 said , ' because we did not pay any attention to it			0
' the @entity169 only looks after any threats against our country , so anything that did not look like a threat to us , we simply look at it without taking actions			0
' clueless ? @entity13 acting transport minister @entity196 , centre , director general of the @entity13 @entity198 , @entity199 , right , and @entity13 deputy foreign minister @entity200 during a @entity4 press conference near the @entity202 yesterday a man stands in front of a board with messages of hope and support for the passengers of the missing @entity4 at the departure hall of the @entity202 the final picture : the missing jet is pictured here in february this year above @entity214 airspace he said the plane never entered @entity18 airspace and that @entity27 's initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific			1
' when they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from ( @entity13 ) prime minister @entity226 , we took a look at our information again , ' @entity184 said			0
' it did n't take long for us to figure out , although it did take some experts to find out about it			0
' @entity4 took off from @entity202 at 12:40 a.m. @entity13 time and its transponder , which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track the airplane , ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m. @entity184 said that at 1:28 a.m. , @entity18 military radar ' was able to detect a signal , which was not a normal signal , of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the @entity4 plane , ' back toward @entity202			1
the search area for the plane initially focused on the @entity123 , where ships and planes spent a week searching			1
@entity245 that a satellite detected from the plane hours after its communications went down have led authorities to concentrate instead on two vast arcs — one into central @entity2 and the other into the @entity252 — that together cover an expanse as big as @entity138			2
@entity18 officials said radar equipment in southern @entity18 detected the plane			2
@entity13 officials have said the plane might ultimately have passed through northern @entity18 , but @entity18 air chief marshal @entity257 told reporters tuesday that the country 's northern radar did not detect it			1
search : sailors from the @entity264 destroyer @entity265 prepare to launch a helicopter in the hunt for flight mh370 @entity18 's failure to quickly share possible information regarding the fate of the plane , and the 239 people aboard it , may not substantially change what @entity13 officials know , but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defense information , even in the name of an urgent and mind - bending aviation mystery			1
with only its own radar to go on , it took @entity27 a week to confirm that flight 370 had entered the strait , an important detail that led it to change its search strategy			2
the @entity288 says that it will use long - range naval aircraft to look for the plane , and send its destroyer , the @entity265 , back to normal duties			0
@entity138 is leading the search efforts in the southern @entity252			0
meanwhile , furious @entity68 families today threatened to go on hunger strike until the @entity13 government tells them the truth about the fate of their relatives aboard the flight which went missing en route from @entity202 to @entity300			1
ten days after the airliner vanished an hour into its flight , hundreds of family members are still waiting for information in a @entity300 hotel			0
around two thirds of the 239 passengers on board @entity4 are @entity68			2
families vented their pain and anger on @entity68 representatives sent by the airline to meet them on tuesday and demanded to see the @entity13 ambassador			2
' what we want is the truth			0
do n't let them become victims of politics			0
no matter what political party you are , no matter how much power you have , if there is n't life , what 's the point ? where is compassion ? ' asked one middle - aged woman angrily			0
' you 're always going back and forth			0
i think your government knows in their heart why we want you to answer us			0
because you 're always tricking us , telling us lies , ' added one man			0
@entity68 has repeatedly called on the @entity13 side to do a better job at looking after the relatives of the @entity68 passengers , and to provide them with updated information .			1

@entity4 spotted at 1.28am , eight minutes after it stopped communicating
turned towards @entity175 , a @entity13 city along the @entity16
@entity27 detected @entity4 on their military radar at 2:14am heading to strait
@entity18 air force did not report contact because ' it did not look like a threat '
it meant *precious* time was being wasted searching in the wrong area
@entity13 cedes control to other countries in *ongoing* search operation
search area consists of 14 sections covering an area the size of @entity138
witnesses in @entity153 report seeing a ' low - flying jumbo jet ' around 6.15am
they said plane was white with red stripes like a @entity10 jet
it emerged the captain is related to @entity27 's jailed opposition leader
families of the @entity68 passengers are threatening to go on hunger strike
