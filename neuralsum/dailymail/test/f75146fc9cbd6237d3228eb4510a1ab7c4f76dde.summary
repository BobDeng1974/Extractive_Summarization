it is legendary now that when the @entity4 national team was coming to the boil and about to scald world football for six years , @entity2 's own fans did n't even know the water was hot			1
because they left @entity4 soil having eked out two single - goal wins , over @entity16 and the @entity17 , the booing , whistling and jeering which had pursued them around the peninsula for two years was the last thing they heard before heading off to win @entity20			0
three trophies later , the senior team is finally in search of a reboot			2
the identity has been eroded by the passage of time			0
the transition from excellent to elderly is never fun			0
@entity2 lift the trophy at @entity20 , but their fans had booed them before , not recognising a great team the @entity34 followed in 2010 and now it seems the right time for the old guard to hand over to youngsters @entity2 won the @entity38 for a second time in a row in 2012 before their @entity34 failure @entity2 's under 21s celebrate winning @entity43 and their brilliant young players are thriving right now nevertheless , the current @entity46 quarter - finals are beginning to say something quite interesting about @entity2 's ' relevo '			1
if you do n't speak @entity4 , that term might mean very little to you			2
but i bet you can intuit			0
' @entity51 ' in this context is like ' relief ' — as in the armed forces term for the relief watch			0
those who are sent in , fresh and ready , to relieve whichever servicemen or women who have born the brunt of service for the previous day or days			0
@entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 have done their hard miles and it is not clear what toll battle has taken on @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
the natural place to look for fresh , young , well - drilled recruits ready to take on the world is in the @entity78 graduates			0
so let 's go there			2
what caught my attention is that @entity85 's arrival to the @entity46 quarter - final for @entity87 at @entity88 last wednesday earned @entity89 a seven - figure sum as part of the incentives associated with the full back 's move to @entity95			1
in other words , @entity85 was one of those guys , just turned 22 , that both @entity89 and @entity87 thought might be playing ' starting ' football at this elite stage of the world 's most demanding soccer tournament — but , equally , he might not			1
the likes of @entity61 ( right ) , @entity103 's midfield metronome , have done their hard miles and can now hand over it is not clear what toll battle has taken on striker @entity73 , who now plays for @entity107 this is the season when he 's broken into @entity111 's senior team , scoring , and formed part of a quite remarkable chain of left backs at the @entity115 — from @entity116 , @entity117 with @entity2 in 2012 , now at @entity103 , through @entity85 to @entity118 , a remarkable talent who is currently locked in stalled contract talks at @entity89 while @entity107 stalk his availability			1
and if you just look a little more closely then the eight teams left to sort the wheat from the chaff this week show evidence that , beyond @entity85 , @entity2 still have a golden harvest to bring in			1
for example , take a snapshot of the penultimate trophy @entity2 won — not @entity132 but under 21 @entity43 , beating @entity133 4 - 2			1
in that final they lined up : @entity136 ; @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 ; @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 ; @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146			0
@entity85 ( right ) played in the @entity46 and is the latest in a string of thriving @entity4 @entity136 ( right ) has been in fine form for @entity149 and is a real goalkeeping talent for @entity2 of @entity2 @entity153 's starting line - up at the 2013 euros , only @entity151 has n't played @entity155 football this season of that starting line - up only @entity151 has n't played @entity155 football this season , eight of them are still in the @entity46 quarter - finals while two of the substitutes , @entity161 and @entity163 have decent minutes in the competition			1
throw in the fact that @entity2 's winning @entity167 coach was @entity168 , 3 - 1 up on @entity169 's @entity87 going into the second leg this week , and the progression from youth - level international football to full - fledged senior winner is going along very nicely			1
the eight starters and two substitutes from that 4 - 2 win are all now in the age range of 23 to just having turned 25			0
between them they have 184 appearances in @entity155 club matches — the vast majority of which are in the @entity46			2
@entity141 has played in the @entity183 , @entity146 , @entity145 , @entity163 , @entity161 and @entity143 have won it , while @entity139 and @entity142 have played in a winning campaign			2
and it is important to throw in the fact that in last week 's quarters , 20 - year - old @entity188 ( 13 @entity155 club matches ) stood out against @entity87 for @entity88 ( he belongs to @entity107 ) , while on the bench for the @entity107 derby were fellow 20 - year - olds @entity193 and @entity194 , who have 18 @entity155 appearances between them			1
@entity4 fans did n't quite know the great team they were getting in 2008 , they could have another one now @entity145 ( right ) celebrates with team - mates after scoring against @entity200 at @entity43 in @entity201 whether they flower for club and country or bloom early but fail to excel like recent @entity4 generations have proven to do , the fact remains that there is a wave of fresh , exciting @entity4 talents who demand attention now			1
@entity168 , whose result probably constitutes one of the performances of the season , has a firm view			2
' i do n't think there 's strictly a " @entity4 school " of coaching or playing , ' he argued earlier this season			1
' there 's just " training " and " playing "			2
so what i ' ve always looked for are kids who know how to understand the game			0
i think it 's a common misconception that players completely understand football and how it 's played			0
former under 21 coach @entity168 has managed @entity88 to one of the results of the season in midweek ' understanding precisely what 's going on in a game is not at all easy			1
' the key is knowing what to do with the ball so that you do n't lose possession and get caught disorganised			0
never gift away space to an opponent			0
' when you control the ball and space on the pitch , then you must know how to take advantage			0
but the line is thin , you want to make the players effective and efficient but never to kill off their creativity and capacity for invention			0

when @entity2 first became a real power , their own fans did n't know at first
the @entity259 champions won three trophies on the spin , but need a reboot
likes of @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity72 and @entity73 can hand over
@entity85 's @entity46 performance *signalled* part of the new era
@entity2 still have a golden harvest to bring in from the country 's youth
former under 21 coach @entity168 downed @entity87 this week
almost all of their former youth side are playing in @entity259 competitions
