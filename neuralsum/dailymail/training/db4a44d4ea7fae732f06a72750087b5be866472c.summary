it is a tender , natural and intimate portrait which shows , for the first time , something of the personality of young @entity4			1
released on his first @entity5 , this official portrait – in a relaxed style perfectly reflecting the @entity8 and @entity10 ’s very modern approach to @entity11 – depicts the eight - month - old as a curious , affectionate toddler , gazing into the eyes of the family ’s beloved @entity14			1
@entity4 seems devoted to the cocker spaniel and , judging by the adoration on @entity14 ’s face , the sentiments are returned			2
scroll down fro video family portrait : in the shot , taken by award - winning photographer @entity23 at a window of the @entity26 ' home , @entity27 of @entity28 , @entity22 looks radiant in the fresh sunshine of spring			1
@entity31 looks more mature and @entity4 looks devoted to the cocker spaniel , @entity14 meanwhile , his parents look naturally and happily into the camera ’s lens			1
what matters more , however , is that they are letting the public gaze in			1
never before has a @entity39 portrait beckoned to an audience with quite the same promise of effortless informality			0
in the shot , taken by award - winning photographer @entity23 at a window of the @entity26 ’ home , @entity27 of @entity28 , @entity22 looks radiant in the fresh sunshine of spring			1
@entity31 appears more mature , his boyish looks replaced by a new heft , reflecting perhaps both fatherhood and his growing stature in the @entity39 tableau			1
christening : the @entity8 holds three - month - old @entity4 at @entity51 in @entity52			1
as he has grown , the young heir has developed an increasingly striking resemblance to other male members of the @entity11 the last time @entity4 was officially pictured , also by @entity23 , he was asleep in a bouffant of creamy ruffles – the historic @entity59 lace gown worn by all royal babies – at his christening last october			1
@entity4 ’s personalised jumper is believed to be a bespoke design , created especially for the young royal			2
the unique powder blue design is understood to have been machine made using the finest 100 per cent cashmere yarn , much like the material favoured by @entity69 of @entity70			0
the family - run woollen mill , which is based in @entity70 , @entity73 , currently holds the @entity74 for @entity75			0
there are however alternative options			0
here , he is a proper little boy with a fluff of brown hair , his mother ’s dark eyebrows and a very cool jumper which could make him a junior style icon			0
think back to prince @entity31 at that age , clad in pastel romper suits and lace - trimmed tops			2
back then , @entity31 was dressed as a royal baby , a little prince			2
@entity4 , as his cute pale blue woolly clearly says , is just @entity4			0
cool modernity with an undertow of nostalgia is the spirit of the picture			0
but it is its unusual and rather daring technical details which make it the most defining image of the @entity8 and @entity22 since their wedding three years ago			2
the washed - out tones seem designed to appeal simultaneously to two very different generations			0
there ’s probably not a family in the land which does not have a similarly faded shot curling in the back of an old photograph album , a picture of @entity111 and @entity112 back at the start of married life			0
and there will not be a hipster twenty or thirty - something couple who have n’t attempted to recreate that very shot for themselves using a carefully chosen filter on @entity122			0
but the message of the image itself is that the @entity26 are one happy , confident family , keen to stay connected to the nation , while belonging more than anything to each other			0
the first family portrait : the moment @entity31 and @entity22 stepped out of the @entity131 of @entity132 in @entity133 and revealed @entity4 to the world new born : @entity4 puts his hands up to his face and closes his eyes as he is cradled in the arms of his mother , @entity140 of @entity8 past portraits : prince @entity142 and princess @entity143 , now @entity143 , pose with a young prince @entity75 after his christening in 1948 ( left ) and prince @entity75 and princess @entity145 hold @entity31 during a photo shoot in @entity147 , @entity148 , in 1983 glowing : princess @entity143 ( later @entity143 of @entity149 ) with her husband prince @entity142 , @entity142 and their baby son @entity75 , july 1949			1
