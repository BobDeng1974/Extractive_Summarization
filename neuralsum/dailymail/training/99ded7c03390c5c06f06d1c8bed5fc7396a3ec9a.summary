whatever the reason , they are out in force , like vultures , enjoying the scene			0

outspoken : @entity9 , who has led @entity7 ’s department for more than 20 years , has made international news for his daily @entity5 rants to his followers keeping schtum : the normally outspoken @entity9 said tuesday that he is prevented from revealing the reasons behind the suspension in a sign of his popularity , the post drew about 1,000 comments within two hours , nearly all of them messages of support , well - wishes or gratitude			1

even an ill - considered parking choice could spur a @entity5 flogging			2
' if you use a handicapped space and you jump out of the vehicle , all healthy - like , as if someone is dangling free cheeseburgers on a stick , expect people to stare at you and get angry , ' @entity9 wrote in 2012			2

we see you , loser			0
' his postings were among the most - liked local law enforcement pages in the country , trailing only @entity41 , @entity152 and @entity154 police , according to the @entity155			0
not bad for a guy who initially hoped maybe 500 locals would pay attention when he noticed other businesses ' pages and decided to start his own five years ago			2
his @entity5 messages extended that open - door policy online for conversations about road closures , charity events , lost pets and whatever else crosses his mind			2
some were serious , such as salutes to slain officers and updates during school threat investigations			2

and , of course , there 's crime			0
