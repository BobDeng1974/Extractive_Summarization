a pair of identical twins , who were born deaf , have been killed by @entity3 doctors after seeking euthanasia when they found out they would also soon go blind			1
in a unique case under the country 's euthanasia laws , the 45 - year - old brothers , from @entity10 , chose death as they were unable to bear the thought of never seeing one another again			1
they were euthanised by doctors at @entity16 , in @entity17 , on december 14 by lethal injection after spending their entire lives together			1
the unnamed twins who died together : they were euthanised by doctors at @entity16 , in @entity17 , on december 14 , by lethal injection after spending their entire lives together euthanasia is legal under @entity3 law if those making the decision can make their wishes clear and are suffering unbearable pain , according to a doctor 's judgement			1
the @entity3 law differs from that of @entity31 , famous for its @entity33 clinic , where only ' assisted suicide ' is permitted			1
this means patients must play an active role in the administration of the drug that ends their lives			2
in @entity3 , some 1,133 cases of euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded in 2011 , about one percent of all deaths in the country , according to official figures			2
but this case was unusual as neither twin was suffering extreme physical pain or was terminally ill. @entity16 : in @entity3 , some 1,133 cases of euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded in 2011 , about one percent of all deaths in the country , according to official figures the two brothers , who have not been named but were pictured on @entity3 television , both worked as cobblers and shared a flat together , @entity55 has reported			1
@entity59 , the doctor who presided over the euthanasia , told @entity62 television news the twins had taken the decision in ' full conscience '			2
he said they were ' very happy ' and it had was a ' relief ' to see the end of their suffering			0
' they had a cup of coffee in the hall , it went well and a rich conversation , ' mr @entity59 said			0
' then the separation from their parents and brother was very serene and beautiful			0
' at the last there was a little wave of their hands and then they were gone			0
' more to come ? @entity3 's ruling socialists tabled a legal amendment just days after the twins were killed which would allow the euthanasia of children and @entity93 's sufferers ( picture posed by models ) @entity3 was the second country in the world after the @entity97 to legalise euthanasia in 2002 but it currently applies only to people over the age of 18			1
other jurisdictions where it is permitted include @entity103 and the @entity105 state of @entity106			0
just days after the twins were killed @entity3 's ruling socialists tabled a legal amendment which would allow the euthanasia of children and @entity93 's sufferers			1
the draft legislation calls for ' the law to be extended to minors if they are capable of discernment or affected by an incurable illness or suffering that we can not alleviate			0
' the proposed changes are likely to be approved by other parties , although no date has yet been put forward for a parliamentary debate			0
the @entity33 building in @entity121 near @entity122 : under @entity31 law only ' assisted suicide ' is permitted - which means that patients must take an active role in administering the drug that ends their lives a bid to tighten legal controls on assisted deaths in @entity31 and ban suicide tourism was recently rejected by the country 's parliament			2
experts say the suicide tourism industry 's clients come mainly from @entity139 , @entity140 , and @entity141 , but that numbers have been declining in recent years			0
statistics from @entity33 show the clinic based near @entity122 has helped a total of 1,298 people commit suicide between 1998 and 2011 .			0
