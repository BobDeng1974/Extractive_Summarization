defence attorney @entity35 said : ' they will not be released until they appear before the new chamber , which will decide whether to release them or not			0
' speaking after the hearing , @entity38 , @entity10 's mother , said the verdict was ' not as good as we hoped '			1
@entity42 said he had hoped his brother , @entity8 , would be freed today			1
' i hoped for more today ' he added			2
@entity45 , the fianceé of @entity8 , told @entity47 the families were disappointed they had not been released ahead of the retrial			1
she said her fianceé was in poor health with hepatitis b , but in ' high spirits '			0
' he 's just a journalist who was doing his job , ' she told @entity47 today			2
' faulty accusations ' : @entity45 , the fianceé of @entity8 , said there is no evidence of any wrongdoing ' disappointed ' : @entity45 , the fianceé of @entity8 , outside the @entity3 court ' they were accused of being members of the @entity28 , fabricating news and harming national security , and calling for a civil war in @entity3			1
' all these accusations are faulty and there is no evidence whatsoever - we do n't understand why they are in prison			0
' @entity8 and @entity10 were sentenced to seven years in prison at their initial trial , while @entity12 got 10 years - three more because he was found with a spent bullet casing			1

family : @entity42 , the brother of @entity8 , speaks to journalists as he leaves the high court treatment : @entity100 ( pictured ) , the mother of @entity8 , leaves @entity101 , where he is receiving medical treatment high court : @entity3 security forces stand guard in front of the court during the journalists ' hearing instead , they showed edited news reports by the journalists , including @entity27 protests and interviews with politicians			1
imprisonment : presiding judge @entity117 handing down the sentences to the journalists last year other footage submitted as evidence had nothing to do with the case , including a report on a veterinary hospital and @entity10 's past reports out of @entity127			2

the @entity16 , @entity3 's highest appeal tribunal , only reviews the lower court 's proceedings , not the case itself			2
@entity3 president @entity135 also has the power to pardon or deport the foreigners under a new law , whether or not the court grants the appeal			0
that would allow @entity10 to go home and @entity8 to go to @entity9 if he drops his @entity3 nationality			1
@entity12 's case would remain uncertain as he holds only @entity3 citizenship			2
a recent thaw in relations between @entity84 and @entity3 has seen @entity1 shut down its @entity3 affiliate , which dedicated much of its coverage to @entity27 protests since @entity26 's overthrow			0
last month , @entity152 said a presidential pardon for the three was being ' examined ' and would be granted only if it was ' appropriate for @entity3 national security ' .			0

the retrial is *expected* to take place within a month
