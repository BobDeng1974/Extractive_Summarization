@entity0 has summed up his @entity2 journey to @entity3 with @entity4 - describing it as the ' best ' and the ' worst ' experience of his career			1
the striker , who signed for boyhood club @entity8 this summer , completed a fairytale journey from working in a beetroot factory 13 years ago to representing his nation at the @entity2 in 2014 when he came on a substitute during the 2 - 1 defeat to @entity15			1
but @entity4 's earliest exit from a @entity2 since 1958 means that the experience has also been a painful one for the 32 - year - old			1
' it ’s a difficult scenario to be in , everyone ’s disappointed about what ’s happened and the fact that we ’ve got one more game left			1
' but we ’ve got to be professional and we ’ve got to give our best and get three points to finish on a high against @entity31			0
' it ’s been the best experience of my career and probably the worst experience at the same time			0
' it ’s always difficult being an @entity4 fan and getting knocked out , but this time being involved is devastating to get knocked out at an early stage			1
' it was probably the worst moment of my career when the final whistle went and we were knocked out of the @entity2			0
maybe i might look back in years to come and think " i ’ve played in a @entity2 " , that will live with me forever			2
but i ca n’t remember any moments that are as bad as that			0
' fairytale : @entity0 completed a dream move to boyhood club @entity8 this summer before flying to @entity3 form : the 32 - year - old enjoyed a fantastic season for @entity60 , leading to his @entity4 call - up despite their premature exit , @entity0 is fully supportive of @entity4 manager @entity64 and thinks he should lead the country to the 2016 euros in @entity66			1
@entity0 , who played in three separate divisions for @entity60 before signing for @entity8 , is especially encouraged by @entity64 's decision to blood youngsters in @entity3			2
he told www.thefa.com : ' one thing is very important - we do n’t make any knee - jerk decisions			0
' i think the set - up we have , the manager who is in charge is definitely the person we need to go forward with the group of young kids coming through			0
' the progression they have had under @entity64 has been amazing , so if he can keep the group together for another two years it ’s going to be exciting and they are going to learn after what has just happened			0
meteoric rise : @entity0 played for @entity60 in three different divisions and score in all of them all alone : @entity64 should remain as @entity4 manager despite their early exit , says @entity0 ' @entity64 has given the young players a chance and they have thrived on it			1
' that ’s definitely one of the positives we ’ll take out of the @entity2 and when the next scenario comes around in the next two years at the @entity99 , this is going to help them			2
' that ’s why this set - up needs to stay together			0

@entity0 came on as a substitute in the 2 - 1 loss against @entity15
he played at @entity2 13 years after working in a beetroot factory
disappointed with @entity4 's earliest @entity2 exit since 1958
he says it is a ' difficult scenario to be involved in ' right now
@entity4 only have dead rubber against @entity31 left to play now
