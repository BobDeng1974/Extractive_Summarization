while we have no problem changing our pounds into the currency of our holiday destinations , a study has found more than £ 550 million in foreign cash is laying about in @entity11 homes waiting to be converted back			1
money saving website @entity12 claims up to two fifths of @entity15 have un-exchanged cash leftover from their getaways			1
the survery of 2,748 people from around the @entity11 aged over 18 found 61 per cent of them had gone on a holiday overseas in the past year which required them to get foreign currency			1
@entity25 stash ! : @entity11 travellers are keeping their foreign currency after their holidays rather than converting it conversion : two in five @entity15 have money they have n't changed back to pounds asked if they had money they 've yet to change back to pounds , 41 per cent those surveyed said yes			1
reasons for keeping the foreign money included holding onto it for a future holiday ( 27 per cent ) and they did n't see the point given poor exchange rates ( 21 per cent )			0
others did n't have time ( 14 per cent ) , had mostly coins which could n't be exchanged ( 13 per cent ) or forgot ( 7 per cent )			0
the most common forms of currency brits have squirrelled away is @entity25 ( 44 per cent ) , @entity45 dollars ( 22 per cent ) and @entity46 ( 21 per cent )			2

under the sofa : @entity11 holidaymakers are effectively leaving money under their couches after their breaks ' £ 551million sure is a lot of money for @entity11 to abandon and leave lying around their homes , whether they ca n’t be bothered to exchange it or not , ' said @entity63 spokesperson @entity62			0
' we understand that it ’s frustrating that travel agents , supermarkets and the like do n’t exchange coins , only notes , which will lead to people being left with a handful of coins , but if you have any cash notes remaining then you should always make an effort to exchange them – it ’s more money in your pocket to spend or save , after all			0
