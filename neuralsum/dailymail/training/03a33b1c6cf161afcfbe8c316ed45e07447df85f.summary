how would the @entity0 fare if it was pitted against other planets in a game of marbles ? the scale of the universe in terms of size is mind - bending enough – but considering the mass of planets can provide a new perspective			1
this animation , created by a former astronomer , reveals the comparative masses of planets in the solar system as they cascade down onto @entity0			1
@entity21 is half the size of @entity0 and has a mass ten times smaller			1
@entity24 , meanwhile is just over a third as large as our planet , but is 18 times less massive			0
the visualisation was created by @entity30 - based astronomer @entity29 for his ‘ physicists formerly of the @entity33 ’ blog			1
‘ @entity24 is n't much to look at , but it 's almost as hot as @entity34 and colder than @entity21 , constantly , ’ mr @entity29 writes			2
‘ it has no atmosphere to spread the heat around , so the side facing the sun is roasting hot and the other side would make a taunton wish for thermal underwear			0
’ @entity24 's high density could be because it 's the core of a larger planet , with the lighter material having been blasted into space by a collision billions of years ago			0
@entity34 is about the same mass as @entity0			0
@entity0 is twice the size of @entity21 and about nine times more massive			1
@entity51 is just over a third as large as @entity0 and 18 times less massive			2
the moon is a quarter the size of @entity0 and 82 times less massive			1
@entity54 is slightly smaller than the moon , but the @entity0 is 460 times as massive			1
@entity0 has a mass over 6,000 times greater than @entity57			2
it ’s the lightest planet in our solar system , making anything there a third of the weight it is on @entity0			0
that ’s because its mass is much smaller than that of @entity0 ’s and its gravity is a third of our planets			2
@entity57 is the largest asteroid , with a diameter the same as the length of the @entity74			0
@entity0 has a mass over 6,000 times greater than @entity57			0
this is an unfair battle , however , as @entity0 always wins in these comparisons with only smaller worlds being featured			0
to see how @entity0 battles it out with larger bodies such as the sun , mr @entity29 has created another video called ‘ @entity83 ’ .			1

the animation was created by @entity30 - based astronomer , @entity29
it shows how @entity0 would fare against other planets in a game of marbles
for *instance* , @entity0 is twice the size of @entity21 and nine times more massive
@entity54 , meanwhile , is only slightly smaller than the moon , but the @entity0 is 460 times as massive
