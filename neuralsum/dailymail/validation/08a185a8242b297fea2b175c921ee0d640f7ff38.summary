@entity0 was more than just the @entity2 ’s favourite servant			1
he rose from impoverished beginnings to become her confidant and close friend			1
as the first part of a remarkable new biography revealed last week , @entity0 was also a predatory homosexual who breached @entity9 security by bringing young men back to @entity11 at night			1
and he made powerful enemies			2
here , in the final extract of @entity15 , we reveal that courtiers took their revenge by banishing him from the @entity2 ’s side , shamefully disregarding her wish that he should be allowed to live at @entity11 for the rest of his life			1
and whatever became of his meticulous diary , the ‘ black book ’ of life with the @entity29 ? so close : @entity15 with the @entity2 on her 88th birthday in 1988 ( right )			1
he cuts a lonely figure in 2003 ( left ) , a year after her death within days of @entity0 ’s death in november 2007 , a small group of men were seen entering his flat in @entity37 , @entity38			1
all @entity15 ’s possessions were boxed up and put in storage			1
there is no proof that things went missing , but the speed with which events occurred shocked his friends , one of whom said : ‘ it was all very odd			2
would you expect your former employer to visit your house and go through your things ? we do n’t know for sure , but that ’s what we think happened – the royal household had sent a team to go through @entity15 ’s possessions before they were sold ... ’ @entity0 would tell anyone who listened that the @entity2 had promised him that his little gatehouse cottage at @entity11 would be his home for life			1
‘ i thought she had left instructions to that effect but i could hardly ask her to put it in writing to me , ’ he said			2
‘ i suppose i was rather naive in thinking that a letter would survive if it meant everyone had to put up with me for a few more years			0
in some ways they were quite ruthless , you know			0
’ rumours : @entity15 said he knew princess @entity71 was having affairs while still married to @entity73 some months after the @entity2 ’s death in march 2002 , @entity15 received a short letter telling him that @entity76 had to be vacated			1
the deadline gave him little time , but he obediently packed his things and left			0
there was no leaving party , no letter of thanks , no formal goodbye			0
an official made sure he was out on time			0
@entity15 did n’t find his new life easy			1
his 51 years of service had given him no time to learn how to live in the evenings and at weekends			2
for years he had organised lunches and dinners for the @entity2 , but he had never had to make his own meals			1
now his life of privilege was over : he shambled along to the shops like any other elderly single man			2
he began to eat irregularly and sometimes not at all			0
he was also shocked at the cost of a good bottle of wine			0
@entity15 had developed a taste for the finer things in life and he was suddenly cut off from them all			1
@entity15 was an amusing man with a remarkable history and he was invited to an endless series of parties , which gave him a faint glow of the life he had once enjoyed with the @entity2			1
‘ i go to these things because i find it so difficult to be on my own , ’ he confessed			0
‘ i enjoy the parties , but would happily give them up if i could go back to my old life			2
’ @entity15 spent night after night in his local pub , @entity115 , where he would get drunk and invite all and sundry back to the flat – anything was better than being alone			1
a friend recalled : ‘ @entity15 sometimes went into terrible glooms that were alleviated only by alcohol			1
it was a habit he had got into at @entity11			1
alcohol restored some of his charm , his confidence and his wit			0
but the fact he was no longer drinking the finest wines in the finest company – as he saw it – took a lot of getting used to and he never really managed it			0
’ despite being regaled as the grand old man of royal service , his friends say that @entity15 became a humbler figure in exile			1
@entity136 had corrupted him and he knew it			0
he had been beastly , he once said , to some of those who worked for him and i think he felt rather bad about it			0
‘ i was naive , i suppose , ’ he said			0
‘ the household disliked me because i was too close to the @entity2			1
i remember one of the advisers saying , “ who on earth do you think you are ? ” i replied , “ i ’m a shopkeeper ’s son from @entity149 but i ’m afraid my company is preferable to yours			0
” i enjoyed my little victory , but i ca n’t imagine he ever forgave me			0
’ in his most bitter moments , he recalled how , in the @entity2 ’s last months , when she was too confused to know what was going on around her , he became so frustrated by repeated refusals to let him see her that he became hysterical			1
he was told that if he did not calm down , the police would be called			0
close friends : the loyal servant dancing with the @entity2 at @entity162 as prince @entity73 watches royal advice : the queen mother ( pictured with @entity165 , left , and @entity166 , right ) had told @entity15 to ' never trust anyone ' ‘ i was upset and they did n’t care , ’ he said			1
‘ as far as the household was concerned , i was simply an ex-employee as if i ’d worked in the @entity170 for six months washing bottles			0
it hurt , but the truth is some members of the royal household enjoyed my unhappiness			2
it was time for their revenge			2
they knew the @entity2 could no longer protect me so the knives were out			2
i suppose i was silly not to have known it would happen			0
’ perhaps @entity15 , more than anyone , should have heeded the advice given to him by the @entity2 , who told him at the beginning of their relationship : ‘ whatever you do , @entity0 , never trust anyone			1
’ @entity15 often told me he wanted to save his best stories for publication			2
the @entity29 , he explained , are very careful about what they say and do			0
but @entity15 knew their secrets			2
he knew , for example , or at least said he knew , that princess @entity71 was having affairs while still married to prince @entity73 and long before it was generally known that the marriage was in trouble			0
he also knew a great deal about the younger generation of @entity29			0
ironically , given his own lifestyle , he was scathing about the younger ones drinking and tumbling out of clubs at 2am			0
a close friend of @entity15 ’s said : ‘ he was definitely writing something , which is perhaps why so many odd things happened after he died			1
‘ i ’m sure that in the same way that someone probably destroyed the @entity2 ’s instructions that @entity15 should be allowed to stay on at @entity76 , they also destroyed whatever it was he had written about his life at @entity11			1
’ when , some months after his funeral , @entity15 ’s possessions came up for auction at a provincial sale room in @entity221 , @entity222 , they represented just a small part of his possessions			2
i know that because i visited the flat regularly			0
another oddity is that not a scrap of written material survived the visit by the unidentified team of young men seen visiting his apartment , including the memoir he was thought to be writing – and especially his ‘ black book ’ , as his diary was known			1
@entity0 would tell anyone who listened that the @entity2 had promised him his little gatehouse cottage at @entity11 ( pictured ) would be his home for life his solicitor , who was also his executor , clearly felt a few letters and mementos were unlikely to fetch a fortune			1
in the event , however , it took more than ten hours to dispose of more than 700 lots that raised a total close to £ 500,000			0
the highlight was a short , handwritten letter from the @entity2 to @entity15 asking him to prepare for an outdoor lunch on a trip to @entity253			1
it finishes : ‘ i think that i will take two small bottles of @entity256 and gin with me this morning , in case it is needed			0
’ the letter went to an anonymous bidder for a £ 16,000			0
but the assumption that these memoirs might have been especially revealing , vindictive or damaging to the @entity264 are probably wrong			0
@entity15 felt uniquely privileged to have worked for so long in a job that he loved			2
