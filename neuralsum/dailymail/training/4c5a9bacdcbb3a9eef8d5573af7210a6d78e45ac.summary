@entity0 played for the @entity1 for less than two years before his shock trade to the @entity3			1
the @entity1 spent around $ 18.4million on the do - it - all , but injury - prone receiver , who played just eight games for the franchise			1
one of them was a dazzling cameo in february 's @entity11 victory which showcased some of his speed and playmaking ability			0
but his short career has been plagued with concerns about his temperament and toughness			1
@entity0 won the @entity11 with @entity21 in february but moves to the 1 - 6 @entity3 with 60 @entity24 appearance to his name , the 26 - year - old moves his third team in six years since being taken as the 22nd overall pick by @entity28 in 2009			1
plagued with migraines throughout college and his first few years in the @entity24 , @entity0 's superb rookie season was a factor in the @entity33 reaching the nfc championship game			1
following the retirement of @entity38 , @entity0 's spell in @entity36 turned sour after the arrival of inconsistent quarterback @entity40 , the 12th pick of the 2011 draft			2
@entity0 fell out with coach @entity43 , one of football 's good guys , and moved to @entity21 two years later , signing a six - year , $ 67m deal			1
the @entity1 traded their 2013 first - round draft choice , one of their three seventh - round draft choices and a 2014 third - round draft pick			0
the move drew criticism from then - mvp @entity53 , who tweeted : ' the best all around player i ever seen or you 'll ever see ! goes to @entity21 ! i feel like i just got kicked in the stomach			2
several times ! ! ! ' @entity0 hobbles off the field against @entity59 - a game where he had three touchdowns disallowed after surgery on a hip injury later that summer , he would only play one regular season game - ironically in a 30 - 20 win over @entity28			2
@entity0 returned for the business end of the @entity11 - winning campaign , but sustained a concussion in the divisional win over @entity70 which saw him miss the @entity72 game against the 49ers			2
but his performance in @entity76 - where he will now ply his trade under @entity74 - showcased his ability			0
he had two rushes for 45 yards and ran back the second - half kick off 87 yards for a touchdown in the 43 - 8 win over @entity83			0
@entity0 returns a kick - off during the defeat to the @entity86 in his final outing as a @entity21 player while rumours of dressing room discontent abound - particularly with quarterback @entity91 - some of @entity0 's @entity1 team - mates reacted with incredulity on @entity95			1
' damn they got my n * * * * ...			0
@entity100 was on a similar page , saying : ' this business is crazy ... hate to see my boy @ @entity104 go , ' on the social networking site			0
yet @entity0 has struggled to stretch the field this season and has failed to shine , despite being used as a runner , receiver and on special teams , contributing 225 yards of offense in five games			1
he joins a struggling franchise which has lost its last six games			0
and with the inconsistent @entity117 just about holding off the jaded @entity115 at quarterback , one wonders how long it will be before @entity0 explodes off the field once more .			0

@entity0 joins his third franchise in six years after joining @entity21 in 2013
when fit , @entity0 is a do - it - all receiver *capable* of *breathtaking* plays
his career is plagued by injuries and concerns about his temperament
he has struggled to fit into @entity132 's offensive *scheme* this year
the @entity3 have lost their last six and next face the @entity136 on *october* 26
