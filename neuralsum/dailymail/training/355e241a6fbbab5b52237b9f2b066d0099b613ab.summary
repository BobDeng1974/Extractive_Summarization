by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 17:12 est , 7 june 2013 a father - of - seven is dedicating his life to showing his children as much of the world as possible - because a rare disease means they could all go blind			2
@entity9 ’s children , @entity7 , 20 , @entity10 , 17 , @entity11 , eight , @entity12 , seven , @entity13 , five , @entity14 , three , and @entity15 , ten - months , all carry the genetic mutation for @entity18 ’s hereditary optic neuropathy			1
the condition , which has already caused @entity7 to lose his sight , destroys the cells in the optic nerve causing blindness , usually at around the age of 21			1
@entity9 and @entity26 's seven children all carry @entity18 's hereditary optic neuropathy which means they could go blind			1
l to @entity28 : @entity7 , 20 , @entity12 , 7 , @entity9 , 39 , @entity11 , 8 , @entity26 , 37 , @entity15 , 10 - months , @entity13 , 5 , @entity10 , 20 and @entity14 , 3 all seven children inherited the genetic condition from their mother , @entity26 , 37 , who carries it , the @entity29 reports			1
she too could go blind in later life as female carriers tend to be afflicted later than male ones			1
however , some may be spared as the incurable condition only causes blindness in half of male carriers and three in 20 female carriers			1
mr @entity9 , a builder from @entity44 , @entity45 , told the newspaper : ‘ we want the kids to do and see as much as they can			2
museums , day trips , beach holidays			0
any spark of interest is followed up – music lessons , beavers , scouts			0
‘ for the young kids it ’s all about appreciating their sight and getting out and doing it while they can			0
every day is a blessing			0
’ he went on to explain that he tries to give his children every experience they want which means that he is unable to save for the future			0
@entity7 was a carpenter until he lost his sight last autumn but he has retrained as a masseuse and set up a company called @entity68 – his father hopes that his other children will be similarly successful if they do go blind			2
the children inherited the condition from their mother , @entity26 ( pictured with husband @entity9 )			1
in some carriers the condition causes the cells of the optic nerve to be destroyed causing blindness mr @entity9 , 39 , says that he now faces a lifetime of watching his children to see if they will lose their sight			1
the family only found out that they carried the disease when @entity83 fell ill last year			0
it was initially believed that he was suffering from cancer but he was diagnosed with @entity18 ’s in august 2012 , just weeks before he went blind			2
@entity18 's hereditary optic neuropathy is an inherited genetic mutation			1
occasionally , it can occur as a spontaneous mutation in someone with out a family history of the condition			0
it can only be passed on by women and it causes degeneration of cells in the eye in some carriers			0
in the @entity100 , the mutation is present in 12 people per 100,000 and symptoms occur in three people per 100,000			0
half of men who carry the condition lose their sight , compared to 15 per cent of women carriers			1
blindness usually develops when carriers are in their 20s , but can appear later in women			2
the first symptoms tend to be blurring of the central vision and desaturation of colour in both eyes			0
most sufferers develop severe sight problems within a few months of the first symptoms appearing .			0

@entity9 's children all carry @entity18 's hereditary optic neuropathy
condition destroys cells of optic nerve causing blindness by the 20s
half of male carriers , and three in 20 female carriers , lose their sight
mr @entity9 's *eldest* child , @entity7 , 20 , has already gone blind
children inherited the condition from their mother , @entity26 , who is a carrier
