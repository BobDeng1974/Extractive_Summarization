by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 07:07 est , 19 september 2013 a young boy was pulled from singing a solo at the @entity3 at the last minute when @entity5 bosses discovered that if he performed , they would be breaking an old law prohibiting children singing live on television after 7pm			1
the child , whom the @entity5 will not identify , was due to sing the solo in @entity12 's @entity11 in what would have been a highlight in the traditional concert at @entity17 's @entity16			1
but just two days before the concert which would have made the child 's name , @entity5 lawyers had to tell him he could no longer take part because they did not have the necessary licence for him			1
countertenor @entity25 , 34 , left , took the boy 's solo part at the last minute conducted by @entity28 , right the chorister was due to sing a solo at the @entity3 but was pulled from it at the last minute instead , executives at the corporation had to scramble to find an older singer to take on the role			1
as a result , @entity37 countertenor @entity25 , 34 , sang the part - which is usually sung by a boy - treble - at the eleventh hour , and only managed to rehearse with the female @entity43 conductor @entity28 on the day of the event			1
it was a disappointment for the child , a boy treble ( with soprano voice ) who had gone through rigorous auditions with the @entity5 to make the final three before being picked by @entity28 , the first female conductor at the @entity3 , for the starring role			1
the other two boys who made it to the shortlist had been on standby and were also disappointed when they were unable to perform because they did n't have the correct licences either			0
an obscure rule dating back to the 1960s bans children under 13 from taking part in a live broadcast after 7pm			0
the relevant part of the @entity63 is designed to ensure children do not stay up late performing to the detriment of their schoolwork , although it is seen as outdated and irrelevant by many			0
local authorities , whose job it is to allow the child to perform or not , take differing views of the legislation , with some turning a blind eye to it and others upholding it to the letter			0
the @entity5 applied to the boy 's local authority , and those of the other two on the shortlist , for a licence to perform but were turned down			1
well - deserved applause : @entity25 and conductor @entity28 only rehearsed the solo together that day as a result , they had to find an older singer two days beforehand to replace the boy , who is a chorister at @entity90			1
a spokesman for the cathedral said : ' i can confirm the @entity90 was informed by the @entity5 in the week of @entity3 that our chorister would not be needed at the concert			1
' a @entity5 press officer said the corporation had no option but to pull the boy from the performance on september 7			2
she said : ' everyone agrees that this legislation is now completely outdated and the @entity5 with other broadcasters and members of the wider entertainment industry are working hard to try to get it changed , but it is not known if or when that will happen			2
' because the @entity11 were going out live , this meant that reluctantly we had to change our plans			0
' but she added : ' @entity12 specified in the score that the solo part can be taken either by a boy treble or countertenor			1
we were pleased to have engaged @entity25 to sing the part			2
' the boy , a chorister at @entity90 , was unable to perform at the @entity3 because of an obscure law children whose local councils agree to grant a licence are able to perform live on talent shows such as @entity37 's @entity123 , but it remains at the individual council 's discretion			1
last year the then - children 's minister @entity126 tried to overhaul the child performance regulations but the proposals have yet to be implemented			2
@entity129 , of the @entity130 , said : ' times have changed a bit since the @entity133 when the laws were passed			0
' @entity135 was designed to ensure the safety of children when they perform			0
it places restrictions on how long a child can spend performing on stage or during broadcasts , broken down by age , and says no child under the age of 13 can perform after 7pm			0
broadcasters are required to seek permission to allow the child to perform from the child 's local authority			2
a spokesman for the @entity130 said : ' this legislation was obviously drawn up in a different era			0
' what we are seeing up and down the country is councils adopting a commonsense approach to the law			0
providing it does n't impinge on the the child 's education , and as long as it is done with the full consent of the parents , councils are using their common sense on this one			0
' he said it was hoped that the legislation might be ' clarified ' in the future .			0

boy treble was due to sing @entity174 solo at @entity3
the child , a @entity90 's chorister , had been through auditions to *win* the role
two days before , @entity5 executives learnt he was not legally allowed to sing
instead @entity37 countertenor @entity25 , 34 , was scrambled to sing solo
