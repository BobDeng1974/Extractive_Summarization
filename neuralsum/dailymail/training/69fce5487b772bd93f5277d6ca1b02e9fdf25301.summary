by @entity1 reporter he may have left the wags behind , but @entity4 coach @entity3 has made one concession sure to please his players training in @entity7 for the @entity8			2
tomato ketchup and brown sauce are back on the menu after being banned by former boss @entity12			1
the @entity8 campaign in @entity14 four years ago was strictly sauceless as the @entity16 coach frowned on the high salt and sugar content of the condiments			1
@entity4 coach @entity3 will allow his @entity21 2014 team to eat ketchup and brown sauce - both of which were banned by @entity12 in @entity14 four years ago but with the @entity4 players losing so much sweat training in the heat and humidity of @entity30 to prepare for the conditions they will face in @entity21 , @entity3 has decided a little extra salt and sugar from the sauces will do no harm			1
butter – previously banned for its high salt and fat content – is also back on the menu			1
even in the cooler climes of @entity44 and @entity45 - upon - @entity46 , the @entity4 management have tried to recreate @entity48 conditions by making the players wear several layers so they sweat more			0
and @entity50 has also revealed that the players have been put through ' brutal ' sessions on exercise bikes in saunas to improve their fitness			2
due to the high humidity in both the @entity7 training ground and in @entity21 , the coach says high salt and sugar levels in ketchup will not do any harm to his squad ' when we were in @entity44 we wore underarmour , t - shirts , zip up tops and a wet top over that , ' the @entity4 goalkeeper said			1
' when it was 22 degrees ( centigrade ) the lads were losing 2kg in sweat in every training session			0
' we are trying to replicate the heat and humidity ( of @entity21 ) ' even at @entity76 last week we trained in the morning , lunch , slept for an hour and then did bike sessions in heat chambers to get ready			2
' we 've been doing half hour sessions in there			0
it 's brutal , really hard work			0
but no - one 's grumbled or moaned about it , just got on with it			0
' @entity3 has left no stone unturned in his bid to get the players in the best possible condition for the @entity8			2
the @entity4 boss has brought a psychiatrist , sports scientists , fitness coaches and a nutritionist along with him to @entity7 and they will all stop with the team until they are eliminated from the @entity8			0
much to @entity50 's joy , @entity4 will be allowed tomato ketchup and brown sauce - both banned under @entity12 - during the tournament			1
' we are allowed ( ketchup and brown sauce ) now , ' said the @entity105 stopper , who will start against @entity106 on wednesday			1
' the food is amazing			0
there are seven or eight different stations of everything you could want			0
