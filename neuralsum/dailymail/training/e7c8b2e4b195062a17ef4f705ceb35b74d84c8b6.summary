by @entity0 published : 15:59 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 08:39 est , 2 march 2013 @entity3 's disaster airport @entity1 - running millions in overspend and years behind schedule - has suffered a new embarrassing snag after management bosses admitted this week that they ca n't turn the lights off			1
three hundred workers are employed at the biggest construction site in the country trying to put right the airport meant to be the most advanced in the world			2
but no - one is able to cut the power to thousands of lights burning at least £ 2,000 worth of electricity every 12 hours in the main terminal hall			0
spot the problem : at least £ 2,000 every 12 hours are thought to be being wasted on lights at @entity1 directing traffic : some lights at the airport are obviously useful - but others are just draining money ' we are not so far advanced that we can control the lighting , ' said @entity27 , in charge of the technological side of the project which has made @entity3 a laughing stock			1
' it is true that deficiencies in the control system currently affect the terminal lighting ' , said a spokesman for the airport company			0
but he said the lights would be left on at night anyway ' for security reasons			0
' @entity3 is currently served by two other airports , @entity41 and @entity42 , both of which are now pouring millions into upgrades as most experts believe @entity1 wo n't be operating until 2017 at the earliest			1
ongoing saga : the airport is years behind schedule and has almost doubled its budget it was supposed to open last year			2
the cost of the project has almost doubled from its original estimate - from £ 1.7bn to £ 3.7bn			0
it is expected , when the problems are resolved and the airport is open for business , 27 million customers can be catered for			0
it has a list of 20,000 things that need to be put right - from fire extinguishers that do n't work to doors that wo n't open ... and now lights that wo n't switch off .			1

@entity1 is already years behind schedule and *massively* overspent its budget
*planner* says they are ' not technologically advanced enough ' to be able to turn lights off
@entity1 wo n't be fully functional until 2017
there are a list of 20,000 things that still need to be looked at at gaffe - prone site
