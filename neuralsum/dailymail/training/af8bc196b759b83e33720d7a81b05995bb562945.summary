a fan has spent hours painstakingly recreating the new star wars trailer shot - for - shot ... with @entity2			1
the first official glimpse of the highly anticipated @entity4 : the @entity5 was released yesterday			1
and @entity7 user @entity6 , a self - taught video editor , worked round the clock to build the sets and props , including the @entity11 , uploading his version just 14 hours after the 88 - second teaser was released			1
pictured , new cast member @entity19 races across a desert landscape as a @entity21 spot the difference : the enthusiast built a desert set using yellow lego and a figurine to replicate @entity19 accompanying his clip the @entity30 fan , who has created several similar videos , said he was ' excited for the movie '			1
he wrote : ' i had nothing to do yesterday so i started once the trailer came out			0
' i built the @entity11 , the x-wing , the speeder bike thingy , a mini tie fighter , tried to build all the sets , and get all my mini figures put together			1
' then just filming took forever especially the special effects			1
' i tried stop motion in front of the green screen and that was hard and by this time it was 3am so like more than 12 hours ( i took a three hour break somewhere ) and then finally gave up and used sewing string for the x-wing and just kind of moved my camera around the @entity11			1
' i was n't as happy with the @entity11 shot but i cant work on it at all today , so i had to finish it like four hours ago			1
' now you know everything about how it was made ! ' on the move : a futuristic robot , similar to the one featured in @entity60 ' @entity59 production company logo , urgently races across the desert uncanny : a ball is rolled to imitate the robot and @entity2 bricks have been substituted for background machines here they come : the @entity67 are on the attack in the forthcoming seventh instalment of the franchise copy : luckily , @entity2 sell @entity21 figurines - which were lined up to recreate this shot opening some 30 years after @entity75 , the teaser kicks off with @entity76 actor @entity19 racing across a desert landscape dressed in full @entity21 regalia			1
while returning cast members @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 are absent from the montage , fans are given a first look at the younger generation of cast members to feature in this , the first of three planned sequels			0
a parched , disembodied voice tells us of an ' awakening ' and reminds us of the dual energies that are ' the dark side ... and the light			0
' @entity76 actress @entity97 is the next new star to appear as she drives a hover vehicle towards a desert town , while @entity100 is seen as a fighter pilot , looking rather like a young @entity102 when he 's headed for the @entity103			0
the trailer also delivers what was initially suggested during the forthcoming film 's development - a clear departure from the over-indulgent use of @entity110 that blighted parts one , two and three of the science fiction saga			1
new face : brit @entity97 - a virtual unknown prior to her casting - also features in the new trailer lady @entity2 : a female figure is used as @entity97 's character , who is rumoured to play @entity120 and princess @entity122 's adult daughter in the new film remote : @entity125 races across a desolate homestead on what appears to be desert planet tattoine @entity129 : the yellow set makes a reappearance for this shot of @entity125 racing off in a hovering contraption it also confirms the welcome return of the iconic @entity11 , and it is seen dodging laser blasts in a brief battle sequence			1
a new lightsaber makes its debut , complete with a sword - like hilt , as an ominous cloaked figure marauds through a dark , snow - layered forest setting			2
with a fresh outlook , a young , visionary director and the return of its original stars , anticipation has been steadily building since wheels started turning on plans to add three further @entity4 films			0
the result of an ambitious $ 4.05 billion buyout that saw @entity153 acquire complete autonomy over the franchise from @entity156 in november 2012 , the @entity60 - directed @entity4 is their first offering as they endeavour to build on the universe originally devised by @entity161 in the mid- 70s			1
the coup followed similar buyouts from @entity164 ( $ 7.4bn ) and @entity165 ( $ 4.2bn ) with @entity153 unveiling plans to release a further three episodic films and an additional standalone film every two or three years - a reaction to ' pent - up demand ' from fans			2
ready for take off : @entity100 is seen in an x-wing pilot jumpsuit as he prepares for battle identical : the @entity2 version mimics @entity100 's appearance in the teaser , complete with hand movements thrilling : x-wings race past a mountainous backdrop in another brief action shot from @entity60 ' new film ' @entity6 ' confessed the special effects took forever and he was n't completely happy with the results with a proven pedigree in tv and film , lost creator @entity60 signed up to direct the first after initially ruling himself out			1
directly responsible for redefining and reinvigorating the @entity190 franchise , @entity60 ' decision made him the first director to work across two rival universes			0
a further coup , the return of original cast - members @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 in their respective career - defining roles as @entity120 , @entity102 and princess @entity122 further whetted the appetite			2
@entity203 ( @entity204 ) , @entity199 ( @entity200 ) and @entity201 ( @entity202 ) were also confirmed , with all three having previously featured in the @entity161 directed prequel series depicting the rise of @entity207 and ultimate fall of the @entity210 counsel			0
new additions include @entity100 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity97 , @entity214 and legendary @entity216 actor @entity215 – best known for his role as @entity218 in 1973 shocker @entity220			0
something new : a striking			0
sword shaped lightsaber emerges as the cloaked figure prepares to do battle brightly lit : despite the lack of darkness , the enthusiast built an imitation of the new lighsaber welcome back : the @entity11 makes a fleeting return in the maddeningly short first teaser trailer painstaking : and it was quickly built by @entity6 , who moved his camera around it to recreate the shot the old enemy : while @entity120 is absent from the new trailer , his beloved @entity11 is at the heart of the action new replica : the enthusiast said he ' was n't as happy with the @entity11 shot but i cant work on it at all today ' actress @entity246 also signed up for a role in the forthcoming film after winning praise for her @entity251 winning role in 12 years a slave , telling fans : ‘ i ’m going to a galaxy far , far away			1
’ meanwhile girls star @entity214 hinted that he is poised to play a villain in episode vii after co-star @entity257 told him to ‘ rip a hole in da force ’ in a congratulatory tweet posted shortly after his casting			0
much like the original trilogy , released between 1977 and 1983 , the bulk of principal photography took place at @entity268 ’s @entity267 , with additional location shoots taking place in @entity271 and @entity272 - where filming began in june			1
the dusty set suggested desert planet @entity275 was set to feature , and early shots indicated that @entity60 was keen to move away from the heavily digitised prequels that provided a back story to the original trilogy , opting instead move away from the blue screen techniques favoured by @entity161 in favour of traditional sets			2
the new trailer will play in 30 selected cinemas across the @entity30 from friday until sunday november 30 - after which it will screen in cinemas across the globe			2
star wars : episode vii : the @entity5 goes on general release nationwide on december 15 , 2015			0
on board : lost creator @entity60 directs the seventh @entity4 film after originally turning down the offer a welcome return : a bearded @entity82 , pictured outside @entity267 in @entity268 , reprises his career - defining role as @entity102 read through : a shot of the principal cast members reading their lines suggested @entity125 would play @entity120 and @entity122 's daughter			2
the actress ( third right ) was seated between @entity81 and @entity83 how it was : stars @entity4 helped define the careers of @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity81			0
all three actors return for new movie @entity4 : the @entity5 as @entity4 fans eagerly prepared for the release of @entity60 ' 88 - second trailer the internet became awash with spoof teasers			1
ranging from the authentic to the downright absurd , each is reliant on clever editing techniques , computer graphics and a fast - paced montage of shots from the first six films			2
bold graphics , a clear narrative and the use of @entity60 ' own @entity59 production company logo make this one of the more believable teasers to emerge in the build up to friday 's release			2
it had many fooled , but the 90 second teaser is a cleverly constructed montage comprised of footage from the previous six films and spin off games			0
somewhat less plausible , this fake once again draws from existing footage , but also cheekily steals a shot of @entity81 from 2013 science fiction adventure @entity336			0
it 's impressive , but not particularly convincing			0
poorly executed and awash with rich animation commonly associated with the prequels released by @entity156 between 1999 and 2005			2
whatever narrative it attempts to convey is undermined by the use of old fashioned graphics			0
crumbling planets , vengeful @entity210 warriors and a galaxy at war makes this another engaging addition to the array of fakes finding their way onto the internet in the run up to friday 's official trailer release .			0

fan uploaded his version just 14 hours after 88 - second clip was released
he said he had to build the set and figures , including @entity11
added : ' then just filming took forever especially the the special effects '
