this is ' @entity1 ' - or ' @entity2 ' - which is perhaps the most treacherous train in the world			2
it is not built to carry passengers , but that does n't stop about 1,500 migrants piling on board the freight train 's roof every day			1
they are trying to reach the @entity15 - @entity14 border to start a new life in @entity17			1
most are refugees fleeing endemic violence in @entity17			1
but they face a terrifying journey ahead of them			0
for years @entity15 's notorious drug gangs have been in control of the route , charging $ 100 ( £ 64 ) or more for permission to mount the train			1
threats , attacks and extortion continue en route after it departs from @entity33 , in @entity15 's southern @entity35 state , around 160 miles north of the @entity37 border			1
warning : a public service cartoon in @entity52 shows the dangers children face @entity52 is broadcasting a cartoon to warn parents of the dangers of using ' coyotes ' to take their children to the @entity14 the public service cartoon shows a father being told over the phone by a ' coyote ' - or people smuggler - that his children will be well cared for			2
the children are then led away by a menacing - looking jackal , according to @entity68			0
the animation , funded in part by the @entity71 in @entity52 as part of efforts to stem the flow of unaccompanied minors coming across the border , also shows the children describing how they were inappropriately touched , forced to work , or abandoned by those paid to care for them			2
the train terminates at the outskirts of @entity82 , 520 miles away			1
there , lying in wait , are more members of @entity15 ’s most powerful and violent criminal gangs			1
dirty , tired and hungry , the passengers then face a 12 - mile journey to the shelter for undocumented migrants in @entity90			2
the gangs take advantage of this			0
the criminals make them pay a toll to walk to the shelter			0
if they do n’t pay , they kidnap , beat them , ask for sexual favours			0
in the worst cases , they ’ll be forced to work for the gangs or be killed			0
@entity15 has promised to stem the flow of @entity17 migrants to the @entity14 by tightening control at its notoriously porous @entity37 border			1
but messages from the country 's top two leaders in little more than a week have provided few details on how			2
and the scene on the ground is business as usual			0
dozens of @entity17 who paid $ 1.50 a head could be seen this week crossing the broad @entity115 on improvised rafts of inner tubes and wooden boards , in full view of @entity15 police on the shore and immigration agents posted on a bridge overhead			1
' i do n't see anything has changed , ' @entity124 , 56 , said as she rode a raft to @entity15			1
' @entity1 , ' a decrepit freight train that carries migrants north from the border state of @entity35 , still carried many riders on its roof			1
president @entity135 's government says it is catching and deporting far more @entity17 , but it remains unclear if enforcement has increased or just that the number of detentions is simply rising along with the larger numbers of @entity17 moving through @entity15			1
in the @entity14 , the migration has overwhelmed the @entity141 , shelters and immigration courts			2
top officials , including the vice president , have traveled to @entity17 with a stern message for those contemplating the trip , and president @entity149 is seeking $ 3.7 billion from @entity150 to respond to the crisis			1
about 44,000 unaccompanied minors from @entity52 , @entity37 and @entity153 have been apprehended at the @entity14 border from october through the end of june			1
on board : passengers risk robbery , kidnapping , rape , and murder to start a new life in @entity17 migrant smuggling is seen as a highly lucrative business that generates payoffs for local law enforcement to look the other way the @entity14 has been sensitive about appearing to be pressuring @entity15			1
but at a june 20 meeting in @entity37 , @entity14 vice president @entity168 warned @entity15 interior minister @entity170 that with the economic growth in @entity15 , @entity17 might decide to stay in @entity15 , according to a senior administration official familiar with the session			1
' we found very willing partners in the @entity135 administration , ' said the @entity14 official , who spoke only on the condition of anonymity to describe the private session			2
' it 's not something where we need carrots and sticks ; it 's been more like we need your help and they said , ` all right , let me tell you what we can and can not do			0
' @entity135 this month announced a plan that includes more border inspection stations to help fight trafficking of immigrants from @entity37 , @entity52 and @entity153			2
@entity170 said last week that @entity15 would put an end to illegal migrants catching rides on @entity1			1
the government had been expected to provide details about the effort on tuesday			2
instead , officials just announced the appointment of a little - known politician to head its immigration - enforcement plan			0
they promised again to improve border - crossing facilities but gave no details on what is actually planned			0
' we have to get more cooperation ... to make the southern border an area of stability , and rule of law , ' said @entity215 , @entity15 's newly appointed head of southern border improvement plans			1
business as usual : @entity15 has promised to stem the flow of @entity17 migrants to the @entity14 by tightening control at its notoriously porous @entity37 border but so far progress has not been made passengers risk their lives to get to @entity82 where they can travel to a holding camp for immigrants and then on to the @entity14 border passengers emerge from the 520 - mile journey to @entity82 dirty , tired and hungry and then face gangs lying in wait the tragic consequences for those who risk riding the train can be seen at @entity235 pastor @entity235 , a temporary medical center in @entity15 that cares for those who lose limbs falling from the train			1
when organic fair trade coffee company @entity241 , from @entity243 , visited the center they witnessed young men and women who had lost arms and legs , and were bewildered and worried that they had become a burden on the families they had been trying to help			0
many of the injured passengers spoken too used to work on coffee farms before the cost of salaries fell below the cost of running the farm , or were teenagers just out of school			0
' one of the men , @entity261 , is only sixteen			0
he looks around the hospital room in total bewilderment			0
two weeks ago , he was heading north to help his family			0
now he is in a hospital bed he ca n't pay for , in a country he is not allowed to be in , and is missing his left arm and right leg			0
i ca n't even fathom the despair , ' the team from @entity271 's @entity270 wrote			2
@entity15 's government had been expected to provide details about the effort on tuesday , but the announcement did n't come at the end of the line , passengers then face a 12 - mile journey to the shelter for undocumented migrants in @entity90 @entity15 's southern frontier is less than half the length of the @entity14 - @entity15 border , but its thick jungles make it highly difficult to police , particularly for a nation already struggling to clamp down on organized crime violence and corruption			1
@entity15 politicians generally see little upside in cracking down on migrants who simply pass through on the way to slipping into the @entity14 , just as so many @entity15 have done			1
they stay only a few days and do n't affect schools or services			0
what 's more , migrant smuggling is a highly lucrative business that generates payoffs for local law enforcement to look the other way and lots of revenue for legal businesses			0
in a purge in 2010 and 2011 , @entity15 's @entity307 fired more than 400 agents for allegedly taking bribes , extorting migrants or failing vetting tests			1
@entity17 migrants routinely say they have been picked up by local police in northern @entity15 , who turn them over to criminal gangs that hold them for ransom			1
in 2008 , an entire town in central @entity15 rioted to defend @entity17 migrants from police who wanted to kidnap them			1
informal crossing has been tolerated for so long that it has become a mainstay of the southern border economy			2
@entity37 resell @entity15 goods on the other side , and innumerable bars and dance halls operate on the @entity15 side staffed by @entity17 women			1
' the tolerance exists because both governments know that people depend on it , ' said @entity37 truck driver @entity334			0
' all of us who live here have done something illegal at some time ... i have			0
' but detentions have increased			0
in late june , the @entity307 said the number of minors detained through the first half of the year was 10,505 , more than in all of 2013			0
monthly deportations rose dramatically in may , about three times the number in january			0
for many , the best chance of getting north is the train			2
but even if officials do make the train harder to board , it 's far from the only path through @entity15			1
migrants with money to pay smugglers also travel by car or bus			0
on monday night , @entity153 migrant @entity358 , 28 , said he had already heard the rumours that this could be @entity1 's last run			0
just before he swung aboard the train , he said : ' i do n't think they can stop this			2
a lot of us will just wait for it down the tracks			0
' ' @entity15 will cede to @entity14 pressure and will implement a semi-closed border in response , ' predicts @entity372 , director of @entity374 's @entity373			1
but rather than stopping the flow , @entity372 says , it will just make smugglers richer			0
' the prices they charge will go up , ' he said .			0

hundreds of ' passengers ' pile onto the freight train that departs from @entity15 's southern @entity35 state
it is headed for @entity82 , where immigrants will attempt to travel north to the @entity14 border
but gangs have hijacked the route , charging $ 100 ( £ 64 ) or more for permission to mount the train
passengers risk robbery , kidnapping , rape , and murder to start a new life in @entity17
@entity15 's government was expected to put an end to the *problem* this week , but did n't
