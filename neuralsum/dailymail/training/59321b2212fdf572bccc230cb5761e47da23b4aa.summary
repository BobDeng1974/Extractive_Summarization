for @entity1 fans analysing @entity2 ’s six years in charge of @entity4 , the devil very much lies in the detail			1
when the @entity9 bid farewell to the team from the small city of @entity12 in june , he did so with a @entity14 title to his name , the first in 43 years at the club			1
a remarkable ending to a sporting fairytale , if ever there was one			1
that feat – which led to @entity2 being elevated to a kind of footballing demi - @entity23 in his homeland – was all the more remarkable in that it did not come courtesy of an oligarch ’s deep pockets			1
@entity1 manager @entity2 speaks during a press conference ahead of thursday 's @entity30 match @entity2 succeeded because he was allowed a free rein to do as he saw fit and was backed by a board with unshakable belief in his methods			1
they also indulged him with time			1
his first two years in the post were spent fighting relegation before it suddenly all clicked into place			1
and there , for @entity1 fans , is the rub			1
@entity43 is not a place which welcomes project managers with open arms			1
tangible signs of progress are best to be seen yesterday			2
for @entity2 , the opening four months of his journey at @entity1 have proven to be bitty and uncertain			1
doubtless not helped by injuries to a string of internationals , the @entity9 has nonetheless failed to convince the court of public opinion			2
and yet , ahead of four successive home matches over three competitions against @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , he feels more certain than ever before that his grand plan is about to take root			1
‘ i think , in the last month , things are happening , ’ he declared			2
‘ i think we are going in the right way and i think the players are starting to get confidence			2
‘ i can see in training that we are starting to get some relations and patterns in the attacking play			2
we are better in the transition defensively and we have n’t conceded many chances or goals			2
so i think confidence is coming into the boys and we are starting to get a good team and i hope to show that against @entity59			1
@entity2 watches on during training at @entity82 on wednesday ahead of the @entity84 tie ‘ if you take the games since the last ( international ) break , we have had some good results and also created more and had a better team			1
now with the players coming back i trust the team even more			2
we seem a competitive and strong team			2
’ even allowing for @entity95 ’s lowly position in the league , there was something indisputably impressive about the way @entity2 ’s side swatted the @entity100 aside on saturday			1
in that regard , it ’s hard to understate the significance of the fact that the influential @entity105 is ineligible for tonight ’s game			2
@entity107 , the only player for whom @entity2 has thus far paid hard cash , is likely to be trusted with the main striking role			1
the @entity110 has much to prove			2
but , in keeping with his theme of individual and collective improvement , @entity2 believes his no 9 is now primed and ready to repay some of the £ 2.3million invested in him			1
‘ he is very hungry to play and he wants to show himself , ’ he said			2
‘ he came on against @entity95 and had a good chance there and you can see in his eyes he wants to improve			2
he is a good player			2
i ’ve seen him score some fantastic goals in training this week			0
i ’m looking forward to seeing more from him on the pitch			0
’ @entity1 striker @entity107 ( centre ) is put through his paces during training on wednesday asked if the player has been physically building himself up over the past month , @entity2 quipped : ‘ yeah but we do n’t we take any drugs so it takes more time ! ‘ it ’s not only two or three times in the gym and you are there , it takes maybe half a year to get the strength we want			1
but he ’s working all the time			0
it ’s also about mentality			0
against @entity95 he kept the defender working , his touch was good , so he has to go on from there			0
’ if it ’s taking @entity2 some time to figure out @entity107 , no such allowances have to be made for @entity142			1
an integral part of @entity145 ’s title - winning team before being signed by @entity146 , the @entity9 has curiously looked ill at ease in the deep - lying role @entity2 has sporadically played him in			1
yet , in a more advanced role in @entity151 , he was a revelation			0
@entity153 made , surely ? ‘ we have different options , ’ @entity2 replied			1
‘ that ’s good , it ’s what i want			0
i do n’t want to stick to one system			0
we want to look at an opponent and pick the right system against them			0
we have played 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 and 4 - 3 - 3 and we ’ll see what we do tomorrow			0
@entity1 captain @entity164 ( left ) speaks with team - mate @entity165 during training ‘ we ’ve also played 4 - 4 - 2			1
it ’s important that it ’s not about systems , it ’s about principles and the principles are getting the full - backs forwards , the wingers coming in , triangles on the sides , getting crosses , getting people into the box			0
you can see that more now and hopefully we can get even better			0
’ we ’ve been here before under @entity2 , of course			1
the green shoots of progress stamped on by another flat , demoralising defeat			0
three wins on the bounce have only been recorded once this season			0
sooner rather than later , he needs a run of results			0
a body of work he can point to as incontrovertible evidence that the project is coming good			0
‘ i have n’t seen that statistic but i want more than four , i want to have 10 , ’ he stated			0
‘ the goals are very clear and that ’s what we ’re fighting for			0
what i have experienced here is that you have to take one game at a time , you need to focus on one and give that all your energy			0
‘ we did that well against @entity95 , we were mentally ready and had won the game after 30 minutes			0
that has to give the boys confidence and that ’s what we want on the pitch tomorrow as well			0
get good control of the game and get the tempo up and try to finish as quick as possible			0
’ what he ’d give for a maximum return from the back - to - back games against the @entity219			0
ten points might not quite have @entity1 over the qualification line ( depending on how the @entity224 - @entity223 games go ) but they would provide considerable shelter from whatever storms winter throws his way			1
@entity1 's @entity30 opponents @entity59 train at @entity230 on wednesday evening ‘ that is the goal - to get through - and that will be hard because there are good teams there , ’ he stressed			1
‘ it looks like a battle between three teams and @entity59 are one of the teams we have to beat			1
if we do that , we are in a very good situation in the group			0
‘ if we get ( back ) to the @entity245 we have to be even better again so i think the @entity30 is very important to get experience and to play together as a team , to get the new players used to @entity84 football			1
‘ we have a new team and a new style of play and i think the @entity84 matches have been very important for us			0
we have played 10 different games now in @entity256 , when you take the pre-season games as well , and i do n’t remember one game where we had control			0
‘ we want to go and control more games , especially at home , and play attractive football			0
i would like also like what you saw from @entity266 against @entity267 , against @entity84 opponents			0
to play high quality games because the @entity30 is high quality			1

@entity2 has had an uncertain first four months in charge at @entity1
the @entity1 manager senses his grand plan is about to take root
@entity1 take on @entity59 in the @entity30 in @entity43 on thursday
