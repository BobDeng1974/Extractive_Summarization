@entity0 may be known for its luxury skyscrapers and bustling streets , but just a few miles south of @entity4 , there is an altogether different sight to behold			1
languishing in the water just off @entity9 , scores of boats are left to rust in a little - known ship graveyard - just a stone 's throw from the city 's lights			1
images captured by @entity18 photographer @entity17 reveal the haunting scenes at the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity9 , which is only accessible by meandering through a cemetery and knocking on private homes to ask for permission to pass			1
the photographs show great hunks of metal languishing in the water on the south side of @entity9 , which is fewer than 20 miles from @entity4 and 18 miles from @entity30			2
haunting : photographs have revealed the eerie scenes at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity9 - just an hour south of @entity4 left to rust : the shipyard harbors disused and decommissioned ferries , tugboats , warships and barges that are left at the site until they are dismantled or salvaged final resting place : another image by @entity17 shows the rusting and peeling paint of a retired service vessel in shallow waters of the @entity20 the dumping ground , which is one of the largest marine scrap yards on the @entity49 , harbors disused and decommissioned ferries , tugboats , warships and barges that are ravaged by the elements until they are dismantled or salvaged			1
before the boats were dumped at the graveyard , the site was used as the slip for @entity59 , which transported passengers and cargo across the @entity20 to @entity62 , @entity63			2
the graveyard has been at the site since the 1930s , when @entity69 's @entity68 company worked to collect , salvage and re-sell materials from wrecked ships and the proud owner , @entity73 , amassed hundreds of warships at the site			2
it is now overseen by @entity63 's @entity77 , which has put 12 - ft metal walls around the perimeter in a bid to block it from prying eyes			0
but while the graveyard remains a little - known secret even among @entity0 , @entity17 - the photographer - has been visiting the site for seven years			2
eerie : the shipyard can only been seen if visitors walk through a cemetery and ask for permission from private property owners to enter and reach the water ghostly : an image shows the @entity94 , which was built in 1921 for the @entity95			1
the vessel and crew were assigned to the @entity98 during @entity99 and based at @entity100 , @entity101 before the vessel was eventually retired in 1972 ancient : the colorful pipes and control panel of an oil barge can be seen at the graveyard , while in the background is a jail cell on board a @entity112 barge rotting : the rusty vessels are hidden behind a 12ft fence near the water 's edge but can be accessed by asking for permission from private homeowners nearby still : @entity17 , a photograph from the @entity120 , has taken photographs of the ship graveyard over the past seven years during his visits to @entity0 he explained that the docks are only accessible by properties owned by families nearby , but that the homeowners allowed him to get a closer look once he asked for permission			1
' the area is filled with exposed spikes aged by the elements , most of these boats have just rotted in the water , ' he explained			0
' the boats photographed were made out of materials taken from @entity138 and used to serve a purpose			0
when they became obsolete , they were discarded and have slowly rotted and sank in the muck off @entity21 as @entity138 takes them back			0
' the graveyard has been a final resting place for a ship that took part in @entity148 and a @entity99 submarine destroyer that was the first ship manned by an all - black crew			1
@entity17 's images also reveal a barge that contains a jail cell to ship prisoners			0
left behind : the collapsing bridge of a retired vessel at the graveyard , which opened in the 1930s and now forgotten : the graveyard has been a final resting place for a ship that took part in @entity148 and a submarine destroyer that was the first ship manned by an all - black crew out of order : waters seep over a rusting barge as the tide rises at the ghostly ship graveyard , which is about 20 miles south of @entity4 and 18 miles from @entity30 tipping point : in this image , the graveyard , which is located on @entity173 in @entity21 , can be seen from an open train box car sitting on the deck of a barge resting place : before the ships were dumped at the graveyard , the site was used as the slip for @entity59 , which transported passengers and cargo across the @entity20 to @entity62 , @entity63			1
it now harbors vessels until they are dismantled and parts are re-used among other vessels that have been left there to rust is a @entity192 fireboat named in the honor of @entity194 , who was elected mayor of the city in 1886			2
the ship served from 1903 - the year he died - until 1958 , when it was scrapped			0
during its lifetime , it helped rescue survivors when the @entity204 passenger boat sank in the @entity205 in 1904			0
' most of the names have been taken off - spray painted over - but the @entity192 fireboat @entity194 is there , ' @entity17 explained			0
' it has sunk in mud over the years and only the smoke stack is still visible			0

vessels are dumped at the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity9 - just an hour from @entity4
the decommissioned ships are left there to rust until they are salvaged or dismantled for their parts
the little - known ship graveyard has been home to ferries , barges and warships , *including* ones that served in @entity99 and others that are *responsible* for saving @entity0 from *tragedies* in its rivers
it is only accessible through a cemetery and by entering onto private property
