by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 03:18 est , 15 september 2013 one of the two @entity2 women arrested for drug trafficking in @entity4 is to plead guilty after striking a deal that could see her walk free from prison in less than three years			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , both 20 , were caught with £ 1.5 million worth of cocaine in their suitcases at @entity13 on august 6 and insisted they had been forced to carry the drugs			1
but now miss @entity8 has told @entity16 from her prison cell that she is going to admit travelling to the @entity19 country with the intention of collecting the drugs and smuggling them back to @entity21			1
' i 'm guilty ' : @entity8 is escorted from a court appearance by @entity4 police			1
she is to admit attempting to smuggle cocaine after striking a deal that could see her walk free from prison in less than three years her lawyer has agreed a plea bargain with prosecutors that will see her plead guilty to drugs trafficking in return for a formal sentence of six years and eight months			1
miss @entity9 ’s lawyer has hinted that she too may plead guilty , and was reported as saying : ‘ it could happen			1
’ @entity8 ’s family , who feared she could be jailed for up to 25 years , are hopeful that the deal could mean she is freed in as little as two - and - a - half years			1
they also believe the early guilty plea could pave the way for her to be transferred back to @entity2			1
the two girls , who had been working in @entity44 bars , have said they were forced to carry the cocaine by a @entity2 drug gang who threatened them and their families			2
now miss @entity8 , from @entity50 , near @entity51 , has agreed not to pursue the line of defence that she was kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to carry the drugs			1
and prosecutors have agreed to drop claims that she was being paid to carry the cocaine			1
charges : miss @entity8 in cuffs with co-accused @entity9			2
the pair were caught with £ 1.5million worth of cocaine in their suitcases it means she is able to plead guilty to the charges without having to admit to being a willing and fully paid - up smuggler			1
miss @entity8 spoke to this newspaper on friday by phone from the notorious @entity71 prison in @entity13			1
she said : ‘ i am really scared about what i am about to do but i am also relieved that there could be a light at the end of the tunnel			2
‘ i ’m now coming to terms with the fact i am so far away from my family			2
after a lot of thought and advice from my lawyer i am going to go in front of the judge and admit i was in possession of the drugs and that i went to @entity4 to pick up drugs to take to @entity21 – i am willing to plead guilty to that			1
‘ i did it under duress , i still maintain that , and i am glad i do not have to say i accepted money to do it			1
‘ i am aware that i will have a drugs conviction , which could cause me many problems , but i am trying not to focus on that			2
‘ pleading guilty is going to enable me to get back to my family in @entity98 sooner rather than later			2
i do not want to be in jail until i ’m 35 – i ca n’t get those years back			2
’ miss @entity8 explained she had protested her innocence at first in the hope that the authorities would be able to track down the gang members but now accepts that is ‘ too risky ’ a strategy			2
pausing to compose herself as her voice faltered with emotion , she continued : ‘ i can not take that chance and face 15 to 25 years in jail after being found guilty at trial			2
the authorities here have done nothing in terms of trying to get evidence of others involved			2
we told them what we knew but it is almost like they do n’t seem to want to look			0
it has been so frustrating and disheartening			0
‘ they do n’t believe we were forced and they seem to think it ’s our job to find the evidence – but it ’s very hard to do that from behind bars			0
this is the easy way out for them			0
’ ' i did it under duress , i still maintain that ' : a photo provided by @entity4 's @entity135 shows the moment miss @entity9 , left , and miss @entity8 were detained at the airport in @entity13 , @entity4 , trying to return to @entity21 it is anticipated that once a plea is offered and accepted , miss @entity8 will be moved to @entity140 prison , two hours outside @entity13			1
she expressed concern that she may be separated from @entity9 , from @entity142 , whom she says is ‘ like a sister ’ to her			0
she said : ‘ we keep each other going			0
’ miss @entity8 is expecting to attend a deposition hearing on september 24 where she will be asked to admit her guilt in front of a judge			0
a further court appearance will then be set for one or two months ’ time to formally announce the sentence			2
a term of six years and eight months is , crucially , below the seven - year limit that entitles prisoners in @entity4 to a reduction in sentence			1
it also entitles foreign prisoners to apply for a transfer to their own country			0
as part of the plea bargain , miss @entity8 is expected to be ordered to pay a fine in the region of £ 5,000 and could also be hit with additional costs			1
new home : it is anticipated that once a plea is offered and accepted , miss @entity8 , from @entity50 , near @entity51 , will be moved to a new cell here , the @entity140 prison , two hours outside @entity13 her father @entity173 , 53 , an energy company manager , said yesterday that lawyers had told him the @entity4 system could allow for the eventual sentence to be less than three years ‘ we are considering this as good a result as we could have hoped for , ’ he said			1
mr @entity179 , who recently returned from @entity4 , continued : ‘ it seems strange to be happy about the prospect of your 20 - year - old daughter being sentenced to six years and eight months in jail , but we are delighted			1
crucially , we could start pushing for her to be transferred to @entity98			0
‘ i am not proud of what has happened but i ask anyone to put themselves in the position of a 19 - year - old who was threatened and told their family was at risk , and think how they would have acted			1
‘ @entity8 is a loving , friendly , outgoing person			0
she has been unfairly introduced to unscrupulous thugs and criminals and did not realise what was going on until it was too late			0
’ miss @entity8 ’s lawyer @entity197 confirmed last night that a sentence of six years and eight months was agreed in return for a plea of guilty during his meeting with the prosecutor			1
by @entity203 published : 16:14 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 03:18 est , 15 september 2013 extract : @entity8 's diary entry for september 10 tells of a man who appeared at the prison with a package and a proposition for her co-accused @entity8 has been keeping a diary of her ordeal in the bug - infested @entity4 prison			1
in extracts seen exclusively by @entity16 , she likens it to a @entity218 camp with barbed wire , describes the ‘ gloop ’ she has for breakfast and reveals how her daily routine includes toilet cleaning ... thursday , august 22 all the other inmates in @entity225 are @entity4 or of some @entity19 origin			1
they are all very shocked to see two white girls here			0
friday , august 23 it reminds me of a regimental @entity218 camp , but with bars , barbed wire , cameras , police officers , cells and security guards			0
saturday , august 24 starting to get a hang of the routine			0
i get up at 6am , take out the bin , clean the toilet , wake sleepy @entity9			0
at 6.30am we both clean and get dressed			0
from 7am – 8am you can use the pay phone in the patio so we both call family			0
my father visits at 4pm , we relax in the evening , eat and are in bed for 9pm			0
sunday , september 1 breakfast was soy milk and bread			0
i served the ‘ gloop ’			0
all the inmates were lined up and ready for their grub			0
friday , september 6 proved we still care about our appearance as @entity9 spent five hours this afternoon getting extensions removed and her hair coloured brown			0
saturday , september 7 on monday the whole cell went through fumigation to get rid of the bugs			2
the bugs are just reminding me every morning that this place is crawling			0
tuesday , september 10 there was a man waiting outside the prison today with a package ... for @entity9			2
it contained food , toilet roll and his mobile number ... i find this strange that a male who does not know her would want to do this			0
we were told that online many people are talking about ‘ making us their wife ’			0
well i tell you what i will not be marrying any of these crazy @entity4 - anas ( sic ) with packages .			1
