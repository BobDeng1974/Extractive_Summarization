@entity0 yesterday said he felt ‘ awkward ’ when he could hear no @entity1 being spoken while on a train from @entity3 to @entity4			2
the @entity6 leader described how he was on his way home when he went several stops without hearing his native tongue			1
his comments followed a provocative speech in which he claimed some areas of @entity14 are being ‘ taken over ’ by migrants , while others have become ‘ frankly unrecognisable ’			2
they came a day after figures showed a significant rise in net migration			2
we stopped at @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41			2
‘ it was n’t until after we got past @entity43 that i could actually hear @entity1 being audibly spoken in the carriage			2
does that make me feel slightly awkward ? yes			2
‘ i wonder what ’s really going on			0
and i ’m sure that ’s a view that will be reflected by three quarters of the population , perhaps even more			0
’ mr @entity0 insisted he was not anti-immigration but said @entity14 should be able to limit the ‘ quality and quantity ’ of migrants			0
while he denied wanting people to be forced to speak @entity1 , he said the challenge of integration was ‘ very , very important ’			0
earlier , the @entity6 leader attacked the main political parties for allowing ‘ open door immigration ’ and said this was not the legacy he wanted to leave to ‘ our children and grandchildren ’			1
in his address to the 800 - strong audience , he claimed he was leading a ‘ patriotic fightback ’ against the @entity66			0
he predicted his party could win the @entity69 elections and pick up support in the local council elections , both in may			1
he even claimed he will have ‘ failed ’ if @entity27 wins no @entity74 seats at the @entity75 next year – and that he might resign if this happens			1

he linked it to a doubling of youth unemployment since 2004			0
mr @entity0 said there were 84 days until @entity27 would trigger a ' political earthquake ' by coming top in the @entity69 elections this has a ‘ social price ’ , he added			1
‘ the fact that in scores of our cities and market towns , this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable			0
' whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals , whether it is the fact in many parts of @entity1 you do n’t hear @entity1 spoken any more			0
this is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren			0
’ the conference , with a large international media presence , was blighted by a gaffe in which a @entity6 member asked : ‘ how can you possibly be a @entity111 and an @entity1 ? ’ he addressed the question to @entity27 small business spokesman @entity114 , and was told by officials that his views were not in line with the party ’s policy			1
mr @entity0 was also embarrassed yesterday when it emerged his ‘ @entity14 , @entity6 ’ slogan echoes one used by the @entity122			1
it has promoted itself with ‘ @entity14 , @entity32 ’ for several years			1
@entity32 leader @entity124 accused @entity27 of stealing ‘ our slogan and our policies ’			1
mr @entity0 tried to shrug off the association , saying people still fly the @entity130 which is also used by the far right			0
but the debacle is embarrassing given the lengths to which he has gone to distance himself from the @entity32 , including banning former members from joining his party			1
immigration figures this week showed a large increase in net migration to 212,000 last year , most of it from debt - stricken southern @entity69			0
