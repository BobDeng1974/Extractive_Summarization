' they are brought in from all over , ' @entity217 said			0
' @entity219 , the @entity205 and mostly south - east @entity37 , quite a lot from @entity220 and also @entity221			1
' we 've set up a close alliance with @entity158 and other strategic partners , including the @entity182 and other national anti-gangs units and conducted a number of investigations , and in particular we 've seen the trafficking and production linked to the @entity118 and @entity117 gangs			0

that was a record number , which was exceeded last year and will be again this time around when figures are collated by the @entity264 in three months			0
the use of performance and image - enhancing drugs ( @entity268 ) , is now so bad that many gyms have been forced to put syringe disposal bins in place , to ensure the safety of other gym members			2
the problem for local authorities , is that the local bikie gangs have linked with criminal syndicates overseas			1

det @entity101 revealed that during a recent raid in @entity287 , detectives even took delivery from a courier			0

' ' @entity350 are diverted for misuse and supply through a range of sources , including the internet			0
' ' the likelihood of the illicit market continuing to expand will be dictated by the demand for the substance and the ability of suppliers ( whether they be individuals or organised syndicates ) to continue to access and import required quantities			0
should this happen , it is likely that there will be an increase in this market			0
' that market is clearly on the rise , with up to 10 per cent of those using needle exchanges now admitting to injecting steroids - up from 2 per cent just seven years ago .			0

bikie gangs have taken control of the illegal substance trade in @entity57
they order *cheaper* *versions* of *anabolic* steroids from south - east @entity37 off the internet and on - sell to customers
drugs are concealed inside everything from sex aids to women 's facial creams and even green tea to try and avoid detection at the border
outlawed gangs also bringing in the powdered form before turning that into the injectable *liquid* inside their labs
sales are often made from the back of shops and garages
human growth *hormone* sales can be worth $ 500 for a single dose but others varieties are sold for as little as $ 50
