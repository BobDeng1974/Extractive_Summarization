it takes @entity1 more than two hours to get ready for a night out - as he transforms himself into his drag queen persona @entity3			1
the 19 - year - old dance student , from @entity5 , says he has always felt more at home in the womenswear section of stores , and started dressing ultra-feminine two years ago			1
in fact , @entity1 only goes out as the male version of himself if he 's with people he 's only just met at university			1
' i felt really at home there and was made to feel really welcome but now i think it was more than that : for the first time in my life , i felt like i was where i belonged			2
' when i 'm @entity26 , i feel so much more at home and i 'm actually comfortable in my own skin			1
more than that : when i 'm @entity1 i long to be @entity26 again			1
' when he first came out to his parents , @entity1 's father refused to speak to him for over a week			1
but he did eventually succumb , saying that @entity1 being gay was n't worth losing their father - son relationship			1
@entity1 said : ' it was really hard to take at first because my @entity36 's my idol			2
ever since he was little he would put on pretty much everything he could find in his mother 's makeup bag when he is @entity26 , he feels so much more at home and says he is ' actually comfortable in my own skin ' ' i felt like i 'd done wrong by him but at the same time , i knew that i 'd told him the truth so i had some really mixed emotions			1
' in the end it was a massive relief when @entity36 accepted me for who i was and , ever since , my parents have been really supportive			0
' he also has revealed since dressing as a woman , has been beaten up more than 20 times			2
when he was withdrawing money on the way back from a night out , three men passed by and , assuming @entity26 was a woman , wolf - whistled as they went			2
when it became clear @entity26 was , in fact , a man , the men proceeded to beat him in a tirade of homophobic abuse			2
' i 'm used to it			0
if anything , the hate makes me stronger , ' he said			0
' i 've had at least 20 beatings over the years simply because i 'm gay			0
' it 's hard to take but at the same time it gives you that bit of fire in your belly			0
the abuse has made me absolutely certain that this is who i am and i 'm right to stick to my guns			0
' @entity1 looks dapper as his male ego ( l ) and loves to apply heavy makeup and wear short skirts as @entity26 ( r ) when he was withdrawing money on a night out as @entity26 , three men beat him after realising he was a boy @entity1 added : ' ever since i was little i 've always liked wearing heels			1
i used to put on pretty much everything i could find in @entity81 's makeup bag			0
' whenever i walked into a shop i 'd always go into the womenswear section			0
all my friends at school were girls and they 'd always apologise for " forcing " me around the womenswear section			0
' what they did n't realise at the time was that i was far more comfortable in the womenswear section than the menswear			0
' i 'd been putting makeup on for years but i started dressing up in drag two or three years ago			0
' @entity1 in full drag as @entity26 on the left , with an unnamed friend on the right whenever he is not @entity26 , @entity1 longs for his alter ego			1
he feels at home when dressed in drag			2
