the worst thing about @entity1 : @entity2 is n't the predicable gameplay , lack of invention and a general failure to evolve the series			1
these elements , although frustrating , still do n't make it a bad game			0
no. the major annoyance here comes in the way the game was released to reviewers			0
given the worldwide embargo on friday ( which coincided with the game 's release ) , many publishers were given just hours to play and review it before racing to get their opinions up before anyone else			0
danger from above : combat still remains fun , but by the end of the game you 're left wanting something new how any of those publications who received the game on friday and managed to write a review on the same day is baffling ... especially given how much there is to do ... still , skepticism aside , put a decent amount of time into @entity2 and you 'll be handsomely rewarded			0
there are plenty of @entity41 quests , side missions , optional crime in progress quests and that 's not even scratching the game 's surface			1
plot follows a 30 - something - year - old @entity1 who 's on the hunt for @entity51 - a ruthless anti-hero who 's put a price on the @entity55 's head			1
he 's even enlisted the help of several unsavoury characters , such as @entity58 and @entity59 , who are all fighting over who takes home the $ 50million bounty			0
so , @entity64 in @entity65 it is , then			1
not the how - @entity1 - became - @entity1 story many fans were hoping for ... gameplay is more of the same - namely , focusing on knocking out baddies using a free - flow counter-centered combat system			1
it 's still rewarding taking out 10 thugs unscathed and amassing a large combo , but there 's no ignoring the fact that it 's starting to become stale			0
to mix things up , new enemy types , in particular , the martial artist - throw in new defensive abilities , but these are soon quickly telegraphed			0
surpisingly , although the staple batarangs , cryptographic scanner and explosive gel ( complete with trademark awful - looking explosion ) pull their weight , the newer gadgets are so unbalanced that they 're not as fun to use			1
@entity90 are incredibly unbalanced and can wipe out most foes with ease shock gauntlets , for example , that are unlocked later in the game , allow you to wipe out hordes of goons with ease			1
what has been improved , though - at least on a superficial level - are the crime scene investigations			1
here , you can use your evidence scanner to rebuild the scene of a crime - rewinding and fast - forwarding to look for clues			1
it 's stunning to behold - even though it 's essentially a simple ' find the clues ' premise			2
visually , the game looks superb on the most part , with one noticeable caveat ... @entity65 is completely lifeless			2
there 's no sense that you 're flying around a living , breathing city - rather a map with monster closets and goon patrols scattered around			2
we 've seen with the likes of @entity123 that such a premise is n't beyond current gen 's power , so there really is no excuse			0
cut - scenes are noticeable prettier , though , opting for a more @entity131 - stylised look than the previous game 's slightly tarted - up @entity132 3 's offerings			1
animation remains strong throughout - especially notable during the game 's ( mostly ) entertaining boss battles			1
a run - in with @entity58 is particularly memorable - mixing quick - fire combos and gadgets with frenetic countering sequences			2
the best bits : although many missions see you fly to a place and beat up thugs , it still looks very stylish for the first time in the series , there is also a multiplayer - which supports up to eight players			0
but this afterthought is not likely to win over new fans to the franchise			0
nor , sadly , will the predictable single player			0
still , @entity2 is a solid game ... even though it may be time to draw this saga to a close ... @entity1 : @entity2 is out now			2
* version tested @entity161 agree with @entity162 ? follow us on @entity164 : @ @entity165 and on @entity166 : @entity167 .			0

graphics are cleanest and most **impressive** of the three games
brilliant cut - scenes and combat is still **enjoyable**
unbalanced new gadgets wipe out nearly all of the *challenge*
**enjoyable** boss fights and **impressive** crime scene investigation
missed *opportunity* to tell story of @entity1 's *inception*
barren @entity65 is *unconvincing*
