we are still 16 months away from the @entity1 and @entity2 are serious about putting everything in place to win it on home soil			1
however , the selection — or non-selection — of @entity8 for the tour of @entity10 has become the litmus test for exactly how serious and to what lengths they are prepared to go to become world champions			1
this is the biggest call of @entity17 ’s time in charge			0
and it needs to be made now			0
@entity20 : @entity8 hoists aloft the trophy as @entity22 are crowned kings of @entity24 again food for thought : @entity2 head coach @entity17 knows @entity8 's qualities team and squad selections must never be made on any criteria other than performance and on merit			1
@entity2 players need to know they have been selected on merit and not because some guy playing in @entity22 has been declared unavailable by a committee sitting in @entity38			1
i am not saying @entity8 would walk into the team but will @entity2 be better off adding an in - form @entity42 winner who offers something totally different from @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 ? categorically , yes			1
if we lose @entity45 or @entity46 , with @entity48 ’s ongoing injuries , an area of strength loses its potency			0
there can be no compromise , or it can erode confidence			0
and surely no @entity2 coach can be happy with the thought that he is not putting out the strongest side ? powerhouse : @entity8 was named man of the match for his performance on saturday only @entity2 and the @entity68 ’s intransigence is making @entity8 unavailable			1
he is hungry for more international rugby and @entity22 are placing no impediment in his way			2
every @entity2 player will want him in the squad as this group have a chance of a lifetime to do something special			1
tough calls need to be made if you are serious about lifting the sport ’s biggest prize			0
on the form he has shown this season , @entity8 must be picked by @entity2			1
even in a team of galacticos at @entity22 , he is one of the go - to players			1
when @entity1 winner and @entity89 legend @entity87 , one of his back - row colleagues , says that @entity8 is one of the best and most special back - row players he has ever encountered , @entity2 need to listen			1
@entity8 is quick , carries well , is incredible at the tackle and contact area and wins his team four or five turnovers every game			2
that is gold dust in modern - day @entity99			0
he is so good in fact that @entity22 have redesigned their pack to accommodate him			2
versatile : the former @entity104 man wore the no 8 jersey at the @entity106 openside flanker is undoubtedly his ‘ gun ’ position but @entity22 have converted him into probably the only 5ft 9in no 8 in the world and it works			1
my old adversary @entity112 — the crazy professor — has got this one gloriously right			0
@entity2 have the players to win the @entity1 next year but you have to get those players on the pitch			1
great teams are made of great individuals			0
the best ever @entity2 back row during my time was the famous trio of @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 and i was n’t too bothered which number shirt they wore			1
@entity123 was a specialist openside but both @entity125 and @entity124 started @entity128 matches in all three back - row positions during their @entity2 careers			1
i just wanted their combination of pace , skill and physicality on the park and a number of high - quality players such as @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 often missed out			0
magic number : back ( left ) , @entity124 ( centre ) and @entity125 celebrate @entity2 's @entity1 win in 2003 @entity22 ’s @entity8 was man of the match in saturday ’s @entity146 final , but he is considerably shorter and lighter than his @entity148 back - row rivals @entity45 , @entity149 , @entity49 and @entity46			1
@entity150 : 15st 10lb @entity151 : 6ft @entity152 : 17st 4lb @entity153 : 6ft @entity152 : 19st 11lb @entity154 : 6ft @entity155 : 18st 3lb @entity156 : 6ft @entity157 : 17st 2lb it will be scary next autumn for opponents to confront a back row of @entity48 at @entity161 , @entity8 at openside and @entity45 at blindside flanker			1
i am a big @entity45 fan , he ’s become a fine captain and has done well at openside but to my eyes he could be an absolutely world - class blindside flanker in the same mould as @entity125			0
@entity45 would have to fight off @entity46 , another terrific blindside , for the starting spot but that is what elite @entity128 rugby is about : incredible competition for places and harsh selection decisions			0
who would have ever thought @entity179 could ever be dropped by the @entity180 last summer ? we have to rid ourselves of this prejudice against selecting @entity2 players abroad			2
it ’s inherently flawed and i totally support the strong words of @entity22 owner @entity186 after saturday ’s final when he said it was ‘ stupid ’ and ‘ misplaced protectionism ’			2
@entity186 makes the point that it does n’t make them any less @entity148 — in fact it enhances their desire to represent their country			0
captain fantastic : @entity45 ( right ) has grown in stature under @entity17 @entity199 went for lifestyle reasons and a last great challenge to stimulate the final seasons of his career			0
and what a success he made of it			0
@entity8 simply wanted to improve his game with a side that placed emphasis on his skills			2
his brother @entity210 — another huge talent who i would seriously consider for any @entity2 squad picked purely on merit — also felt the south of @entity217 was the environment where his game could flourish			2
these were huge decisions the @entity8 brothers made , uprooting family and tearing themselves away from the familiarity of @entity225 rugby to test themselves in a hugely competitive league and to join a club where a @entity230 start had to be earned every week			0
there were no guarantees yet here they are with two @entity146 winner ’s medals apiece			0
a coach looking on should be very impressed by the independence of mind and spirit , rather than be suspicious			0
knocking on the door : @entity8 's performances mean he surely can not be ignored any longer			2

@entity8 man of the match in @entity22 's @entity146 final win
*ex-london* @entity104 man rated among the best back row *forwards* in the world
@entity68 rules state that no player playing outside of @entity2 can be selected for the national team
but *allowing* @entity8 to play would boost @entity2 's @entity1 chances
