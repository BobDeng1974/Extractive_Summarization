for @entity1 , seven , everything from speaking to sitting up is a challenge - all because she was born with athetoid cerebral palsy			1
but brave @entity1 , from @entity4 , has refused to let her disability hold her back and has landed a starring role in @entity8 's new childrenswear campaign			1
@entity1 , whose condition was caused by a prolonged loss of oxygen at birth , was chosen after attending a casting earlier this year , where she shone in front of the camera			2

in the q&a accompanying the campaign , @entity1 charmingly reveals that the funniest person she knows is her mother and that she would choose to play all day if she ruled the world			1
' @entity1 has a beautiful smile and modelling is not all about being perfect , so we thought why should n’t she be considered , ' said her mother @entity20 , 42			2
' there are lots of things she ca n’t do and will never be able to do because of her disabilities , so it was really nice for her to have this experience			0
' i hope it will help the image of disabled children and also open people ’s eyes to the fact there are lots of children out there who are n’t perfect			0
' @entity1 , who has a 10 - year - old brother named @entity57 , was born with athetoid cerebral palsy , which affects her movement , balance and speech			1

challenge : because of her condition , @entity1 is unable to walk and can only talk using an eye - operated computer adorable : @entity8 say they are thrilled that @entity1 made the cut during an open casting held last may but the seven - year - old has always enjoyed choosing her own clothes , so her mother thought she might like to try modelling			0
' my mum suggested it as @entity1 loves pretty clothes and particularly likes wearing those designed by @entity8 , ' explained @entity20 , a trade manager for @entity85			0
' @entity1 has so many things against her and as her mother i just wanted her to be able to do something that any child could or would love to do , given the chance			2

' @entity126 , head of campaigns at the disability charity scope said : ' there has certainly been a lack of diversity in kids modelling campaigns to date , which means that disabled children are often not represented			0
