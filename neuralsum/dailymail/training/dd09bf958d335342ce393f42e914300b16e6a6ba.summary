by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:34 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 02:34 est , 27 february 2013 ' diabolical catastrophe ' : ten @entity4 mps are calling for @entity6 chief sir @entity5 to quit for presiding over the scandal at @entity8 ten @entity4 @entity3 are calling for @entity6 chief sir @entity5 to quit for presiding over the ‘ diabolical catastrophe ’ at @entity8			1
@entity10 , mp for @entity11 , has drawn up a @entity12 calling for him to ‘ face consequences ’ for the scandal in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly			1
two other @entity3 compared the scandal to the cover - up over the 1989 @entity18 football tragedy , suggesting that officials and former ministers may have known more about the appalling abuse and still have questions to answer			2
the growing clamour in @entity24 for sir @entity5 to fall on his sword increases the pressure on @entity28 , who repeated yesterday that he had his full backing and is ‘ doing a very good job ’			0
however , miss @entity10 attacked the ‘ thunderous silence around the @entity6 ... which goes well beyond @entity32 ’			1
she called for sir @entity5 , former health secretaries and other officials to reveal what they knew about high mortality rates and whistleblowers , and said that @entity6 failures could be widespread			1
fourteen more trusts are being investigated over 7,000 deaths from 2006 to 2010 , according to figures released by the conservatives			1
miss @entity10 said that up to 2,800 of those people ‘ should have been saved ’ because they died after 2008 after the horrors at @entity46 had been exposed			1
the mps are calling for sir @entity5 to resign as chief executive of the @entity6 because of his previous role as head of the @entity51 , which managed @entity46 hospitals but failed to spot the abuse			1
a @entity4 source said sir @entity5 was a ‘ dead man walking ’ , but believed that he was being kept on to oversee crucial @entity6 reforms as 200 commissioning boards take control of budgets on april 1			1
miss @entity10 said : ‘ there has been a thunderous silence around the @entity6 and the @entity62 scandal and relatives of those who died needlessly have been screaming into a vacuum for those in positions of authority who were responsible to be held to account			1
talking about accountability is meaningless if no action is taken			0
we are calling for a proper investigation into who else knew what and when , from managers to former officials and former ministers , and for them to be held accountable			2
' @entity5 ' : @entity10 ( right ) , mp for @entity11 , has drawn up a @entity12 calling for him to ' face consequences ' for the scandal in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly which is backed by @entity3 including @entity81 ( left ) who said there was a ' culture of secrecy and cover up ' ' thunderous silence around the @entity6 ' : miss @entity10 called for sir @entity5 , former health secretaries and other officials to reveal what they knew about high mortality rates and whistleblowers at @entity46 hospitals ‘ @entity5 was then overall in charge of @entity62			1
in no other walk of life would a man who had overseen such a diabolical catastrophe keep his job			0
’ two recent polls have shown that nine out of 10 @entity6 staff believe he should quit his £ 270,000 - a - year post			1
last night , the ten mps who backed calls for sir @entity5 ’s resignation included @entity81 , mp for @entity105 , who told the @entity106 earlier this week that sir @entity5 should resign for overseeing a ‘ culture of secrecy and cover up that cost many people their lives ’			1
one of mr @entity81 ’s constituents , @entity113 , 20 , was taken to @entity8 with a ruptured spleen after a motorbike accident , but was diagnosed with fractured ribs and sent home with painkillers			0
he bled to death hours later at his home in @entity121 , @entity105 in april 2006			0
dr @entity122 , mp for @entity123 and a former @entity124 , said : ‘ i find it extraordinary that more than a thousand people died at an @entity6 hospital and no one takes the rap			2
comparing cover - ups : two mps compared the scandal to the cover - up over the 1989 @entity18 football tragedy , suggesting officials and former ministers may have known more about the appalling abuse and still have questions to answer ‘ if a thousand people died in a prison or at the hands of the police it would be unthinkable for someone not to stand down			2
’ @entity144 , who will question sir @entity5 at the health select committee next month , said : ‘ if i was in his position , i would go			0
‘ i find it very difficult to believe someone whose hand was at the tiller was ignorant of what was happening at @entity62			0
it is comparable to @entity18 – this is 1,200 patients dying in their own urine and faeces and having to drink water from flowerpots , it is horrendous on an epic scale			0
‘ it is culpability or ignorance and if he did n’t know he should have done , so it creates serious doubts about his fitness to continue and drive forward the changes needed in the @entity6			2
’ @entity168 ’s health spokesman @entity167 , who was health secretary at the time of the scandal , yesterday claimed that despite the @entity8 failings , the @entity6 had got ‘ much better ’ under sir @entity5 ’s watch			2
@entity173 , mp for @entity174 , said : ‘ @entity167 commendably led @entity24 in calling for the full truth about @entity18 , because we had official reports which did not give families the justice they demanded , and it took @entity24 many years to get to the truth			0
‘ families should n’t have to wait years for the full truth about @entity32 to come out			0
it absolutely beggars belief that some hospitals were given foundation trust status with high mortality rates and ministers were never told			0
’ last night , mps @entity10 , @entity81 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 said they had signed the motion , while another four spoke to the @entity106 expressing their support for it			1
the prime minister ’s spokesman said : ‘ @entity28 understands the strength of feeling from the families and relatives of those who suffered at @entity62			0
sir @entity5 did the right thing in apologising for the period he was in charge of the @entity203			0
he is doing a very good job			0

@entity10 drew up a motion calling for him to ' face consequences '
fourteen more trusts are being investigated over 7,000 deaths from 2006 - 10
