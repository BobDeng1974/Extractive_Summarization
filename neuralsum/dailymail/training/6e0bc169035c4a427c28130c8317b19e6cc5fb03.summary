by @entity0 published : 04:33 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 05:38 est , 11 july 2013 as many as 80,000 @entity2 could move to @entity3 when new @entity5 rules come into force in less than six months , it emerged today			1
a new survey has revealed that nearly 20 per cent of 15 to 55 - year - olds - around 400,000 - want to escape their struggling country , with the @entity3 at the top of their list			1
from january 1 , @entity3 will not be able to stop eastern @entity13 nationals taking up residence here			1
influx : figures from the @entity17 in may show 103,000 people born in @entity19 and @entity2 are working in the @entity3 according to @entity20 , a poll by @entity22 carried out for the @entity23 shows the @entity3 has been the destination of choice for 22.5 per cent of @entity2 migrants in recent years			0
if the same proportion relocates next year , that could mean a further 80,000 @entity2 coming to @entity3			2
@entity2 , which has a population of 7.3million , is one of the @entity5 's poorest countries			0
@entity33 leader @entity32 said the figures would put a huge strain on hospitals , schools and the benefits system			1
he told @entity20 : ' according to these figures , almost 100,000 @entity2 want to come here and that number may hit a million in future years			0
' to stop them , we need to leave the @entity5 - nothing else will do			2
' in search of a better life : around 80,000 @entity2 are expected to descend on @entity3 when border controls are relaxed in less than six months ( file picture ) at present , @entity19 and @entity2 can only work in @entity3 if they are self - employed or one of a limited number of seasonal employees who are allowed to work for six months before returning home			2
but from january 1 next year , citizens from the new @entity5 member states win the right to unlimited access to @entity3 â€™s jobs market			1
just 2,000 @entity19 and @entity2 worked in @entity3 in 1997 , which jumped to 29,000 a decade later when the two countries joined the @entity5			1
now there are more than 100,000 more than 100,000 @entity19 and @entity2 have already come to live in this country , but under @entity5 freedom of labour rules their citizens will be able to take @entity3 jobs without restrictions from january			1
the poll comes a day after it emerged that half a million more immigrants arrived in @entity3 from the @entity5 than was previously believed			1
it means immigration between mid- 1997 and mid- 2010 , while @entity68 was in power , now totals nearly 4million , rather than the 3.4million recorded			0
the number of people who went under the radar would have filled a city the size of @entity76			0
a paper , published by the @entity17 , has acknowledged for the first time that the majority of the people who slipped through the net were @entity13 migrants the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) discovered the mistake in may when they compared the results of the 2011 census with the population that they had expected to find on the basis of births , deaths and official immigration figures , @entity82 said			0
the @entity91 has so far refused to provide official estimates on immigration as ministers believe they would not be reliable			0
but campaigners such as @entity82 have warned that up to 250,000 @entity19 and @entity2 could arrive in the first five years after the restrictions are lifted on january 1 , 2014			2
stricter immigrations rules are being drafted by home secretary @entity98 , but these will not come into force until at least next @entity100 , so will miss the @entity5 rule change .			0

around 400,000 15 to 55 - year - olds want to escape their struggling country
under @entity5 rules from january , they can take @entity3 jobs without restrictions
campaigners say it will put huge strain on schools , hospitals and benefits
