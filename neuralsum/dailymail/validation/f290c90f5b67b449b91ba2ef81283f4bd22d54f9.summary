those who would love to see the lesser spotted @entity1 back competing on a tennis court are learning that it is a question of hope trumping expectation			1
having withdrawn from the qualifying event of this week ’s @entity7 , she has now removed herself from the entry list to next month ’s @entity10 event in @entity11 , and the new target for her return appears to be the @entity14 in may			1
that suggests she is going to be left with at least 16 months of catching up to do when her troublesome wrist is deemed fit for full tournament play again , having not played since the @entity19 in january last year			1
former @entity21 no 1 @entity1 protects her wrist while out in @entity23 nobody is more frustrated about this than @entity26 herself , now 21 and without a world ranking			1
she would dearly love to be in @entity29 now , but instead is back practising over in @entity30 near @entity31 at the @entity32			2
perhaps encouragingly , she posted a picture of herself on @entity34 doing a full , tendon - testing handstand			1
@entity26 admitted last summer that she has shed tears over this hiatus in her career , which has proved longer than feared since she played her last match in @entity40 before eventually undergoing wrist surgery			1
here this week her manager , @entity42 , issued a positive - sounding update while preaching patience : “ i ’m happy with the way it ’s been going and she ’s been hitting the ball great in practice , ” he said			2
“ it ’s a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week			2
it ’s all about when she is ready to compete			0
we do n’t want to put her in a situation where she ca n’t play a full tournament			0
” among @entity42 ’s other clients include @entity62 , whose intermittent struggles with her shoulder have informed his approach			0
“ i learned a lot from the whole experience with @entity62 , and that ’s why i feel strongly about not rushing it			0
@entity1 is still young with a lot of time ahead			1
” @entity62 seems to have won her battle , but there are other examples of players who show just what a tough road lies ahead for @entity26 - and that on the assumption that she shows a full - on appetite for hard work that has not always been evident			1
when she finally decided to go for surgery last april to repair a minor tendon tear she sought the advice of @entity86 champion @entity85 , who has had operations on both wrists			2
she used the same specialist at the @entity90 in @entity91			0
ironically this has turned out to be the @entity94 ’s own comeback event and on thursday evening he lost 6 - 4 7 - 6 to @entity96			1
the fact that this was just his second tournament in fourteen months after an abortive return in january shows just how infernally complex wrist injuries are for tennis players			1
he was just delighted to be back on court : “ it 's not 100 % free , but i felt even better than @entity107 tournament in january , ” he said			2
“ it 's only two months after my second surgery and my left wrist			1
i feel better week by week , but it 's still very early to feel 100 %			0
“ mentally you must be strongest enough to deal with the problem and get up every morning to do your treatments and rehab and stay calm , looking forward for the future			0
i 'm not hurried to be in the top 10 very soon			0
i want to play tennis			0
it does n't matter how long it 's take me to be in the top again			0
” being absent for a long period of time with any injury brings with it problems in a tennis world that constantly evolves			0
an example of this is 2010 @entity131 finalist @entity130 , who was out for 17 months following the @entity132 due to a shoulder problem that required surgery			2
@entity26 has sought the advice of @entity86 champion @entity85 @entity85 made only his second tournament appearance in 14 months at the @entity7 since returning at the start of last year the talented @entity138 has not got past the third round at any event and her ranking still languishes at 153			1
she lost another first round here this week			0
so it could be hard for @entity26 whenever she returns , although on her side is that she does have bags of natural ability and is a superb ball striker			1
that much was clear when , enjoying a rare spell free from injury , she became the first @entity21 player since @entity155 to reach the world ’s top 30 in the summer of 2013 aged only 19			0
it might yet make more sense for her to wait until the season begins on more forgiving grass rather than arduous clay to make her return			2
when she does she will have a new clothes sponsor in @entity165 after being dropped by adidas , and will be coached by @entity168 @entity167 , a former guide of @entity170			0
the 22 year - old from @entity172 plays world no 15 @entity173 in the second round while @entity176 will take on @entity178 ’s @entity177 .			1

@entity1 has not played since @entity19 in january 2014
the 21 - year - old troubled by wrist following surgery in march last year
@entity26 forced to cancel plans to return in the @entity10 event in @entity11
