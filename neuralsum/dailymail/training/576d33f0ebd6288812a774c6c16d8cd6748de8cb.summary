researchers from the @entity1 have discovered that protestants who suppress sexual feelings and anger are more artistic and creative than @entity5 and @entity6 @entity2 are more creative than @entity5 and @entity6 , new research has found			1
researchers from the @entity1 wanted to test a previously - held theory that introverted people who suppress emotions about sex and depravity are more creative than people who are more open and extroverted			1
they discovered that @entity2 , or people who grow up in a @entity2 communities , can channel suppressed emotions more effectively than their @entity18 and @entity6 counterparts			1
the research , led by @entity20 along with @entity21 and @entity22 , claims that its not that @entity6 and @entity5 do n't suppress the same feelings about sexual taboos as @entity2 , but they channel it into feelings of guilt , rather than through art or creative means			1
the team of researchers from @entity32 began by analysing a @entity34 study by @entity35 and @entity36 that began in the 1920s , which wanted to test if there was a connection between high @entity40 , creativity and religion			0
@entity35 and @entity36 interviewed participants when they were children and repeated these interviews over the following decades			0
during the 1950s , the researchers asked specific questions about whether the participants had ' any major problems or marked difficulties related to sex ' , as well as being asked to list any creative accomplishments they had achieved			1
@entity20 and her colleagues used these questions to conduct experiments on 127 ' religious ' men			2
of the participants , 60 were white protestants , 40 were white @entity6 , and 27 were @entity5			1
the researchers said they excluded white @entity5 because this group ' would be much more intermixed with , and influenced by , the wider protestant culture '			2
some of the men were given a photo album and told to imagine the images in the album were members of their family			0
one of the images of a sister - type figure showed an attractive woman in a bikini designed to make the participants feel sexually uncomfortable			0
a second experiment involved participants being asked to write about their family before being told to create a clay sculpture and then write a poem			1
the results found that ' protestants produced more creative artwork ( sculptures , poems , collages , cartoon captions ) when they were primed with damnation - related words , induced to feel unacceptable sexual desires , or forced to suppress their anger			1
' researchers asked men of different religions to suppress their emotions , before being asked to sculpt or write a poem			1
although @entity2 were more creative , the study claims @entity5 and @entity6 already have adequate ways to absolve guilt caused by these feelings , in confession booths , pictured , for example yet the researchers added that activating anger or sexual attraction was n't enough to cause the creativity , and that these feelings had to be suppressed in one form or another to give ' the emotion its creative power			1
' @entity105 said : ' protestants who had major problems or marked difficulties related to sexual taboos and depravity anxieties showed greater creative achievements in their lives			0
' they had more publications and creative accomplishments in other areas ( and also ) disproportionately chose jobs in the most creative occupations			0
' neither of these results held for @entity18 and @entity6 participants			1
' the paper goes on to say that @entity2 participants were more likely to include sexual and phallic symbols in their artwork , too			2
during a third test , 42 @entity2 and 54 catholic or @entity6 students were to told to focus on repressing anger			1
half of them were told to recall a time in their life when they had been ' very angry ' and were asked to visualise how they wanted to hurt the person who had made them angry			0
they were additionally told to make a fist with their hand while they wrote about the incident			0
the other half had to recall an event where they did n't feel overly happy , sad or angry			0
famous protestant artwork includes @entity139 the @entity141 's @entity140 me tangere , pictured , which is a rare @entity2 oil painting of @entity144 they were then told to create captions for five cartoons , which were later judged based on their wit and creativity			2
@entity20 said : ' without this suppression manipulation , protestants in the other conditions scored about the same as @entity18 and @entity6 participants			1
' one reason why the researchers believe the @entity5 and @entity6 did n't show the same level of creative flair was because they ' seemed to show greater guilt reactions ' during the tests			1
the researchers said : ' both @entity160 and @entity18 have formal institutions and rituals that allow a person to atone for and repent one â€™s sins			2
alternatively , @entity2 apparently do n't have this method of channeling their anger and therefore needed a way ' to work through their forbidden emotions			2
' the team of researchers from @entity32 began by analysing a study by @entity35 and @entity36 that began in the 1920s in @entity34			0
this study wanted to test if there was a connection between high @entity40 , religion and religion 's role in creativity			0
@entity35 and @entity36 interviewed participants when they were children , during the 1920s , and repeated these interviews over the following decades			0
during the 1950s the researchers asked specific questions about whether they had ' any major problems or marked difficulties related to sex ' , as well as being asked to list any creative accomplishments they had achieved			2
this was the first indication that intelligence made people more creative , but a person 's religious beliefs could hinder or develop this creativity			0
the more religious participants in the study were found to be more creative			2
protestants disproportionately chose jobs in the most create industries , too			0
these questions formed the basis of the @entity32 study .			0

researchers carried out experiments on men of different religions
in certain *situations* , men were told to suppress sexual desire and anger
following both tests , the participants were asked to sculpt or write a poem
@entity2 men were found to be more creative than @entity5 or @entity6
thought this is because they do n't have an outlet such as confession - or @entity18 guilt
