by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:44 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 12:48 est , 3 december 2012 @entity2 was last night accused of attempting to hijack a petition calling for new laws to shackle the @entity5			1
the petition , launched by the father of @entity8 last week , urges the three party leaders to implement every word of @entity12 ’s 2,000 - page report on press standards			1
set up by the hacked off protest group , it has been widely portrayed as non-partisan campaign			0
petition : @entity18 , left , and @entity19 , right , launch the hacked off petition , urging the government to implement all recommendations made by the @entity23 but last night it emerged the @entity2 is using its own resources to mobilise support for the petition			1
it hopes to force @entity29 to back down on his pledge to protect free speech by shunning @entity12 ’s call for a state - backed regulator			1
today it emerged both the prime minister and @entity12 have been called to give evidence to a powerful parliamentary committee on his plans for press regulation			2
the @entity40 has launched a new inquiry into press regulation , and hopes that the pm and the @entity44 judge will be star witnesses			0
@entity47 chairman @entity46 , @entity49 editor @entity48 and representatives of the hacked off campaign have also been asked to give evidence			2
culture secretary @entity53 today pleaded for cross-party unity as mps again clashed on the government ’s response to the report			1
mr @entity29 has made clear he opposes using the law to enforce regulation of the press , defying calls from @entity2 , @entity63 and some of his own @entity65 mps			1
as the @entity40 began a debate on the judge ’s report , mrs @entity53 warned mps : ‘ we must not allow this debate to polarise us			1
we all agree on the need for a tough and independent regulator for the press ... we all agree that the suffering of the victims and their families can not be allowed to happen again			0
‘ we all agree that the status quo is not an option			0
it is the responsibility of this @entity82 to ensure that whatever is put in place is effective			0
‘ this is common ground , let us put to one side the politics and let us turn our focus on the principles			0
’ but @entity2 ’s deputy chairman @entity90 has said the party would ‘ bring to bear every resource ’ on the issue			1
mr @entity29 has grave concerns about state involvement in a regulator and believes the press should be given the chance to face a tough new regime of independent regulation			0
yesterday it emerged that 2,000 editors are ready to sign up to independent regulation in the wake of the phone hacking scandal			0
@entity2 support : both party leader @entity107 and @entity2 's deputy chairman @entity90 have told their @entity109 followers to sign the campaign and mr @entity90 has asked all party members to sign @entity107 's tweet : labour leader @entity107 urges his followers to sign the petition on saturday @entity46 , chairman of the @entity47 , dismissed claims that legislation was needed to persuade publishers to join a tougher regulatory system			1
the peer , who will take part in talks between the prime minister and newspaper editors tomorrow , said five - year rolling contracts would ensure publications could not ‘ walk away ’ from a new regime			0
he said : ‘ i have spoken to 120 publishers speaking on behalf of 2,000 editors			0
they have all told me they will sign up			0
’ - @entity134 editor @entity133 labour leader @entity107 yesterday urged his 177,000 @entity109 followers to sign the petition			1
mr @entity90 has been authorised to use @entity2 ’s databases to email all party members telling them to back the petition			1
in an extraordinary message , he told them to persuade family and friends to sign up as well , in the hope of forcing the prime minister to reverse his ‘ betrayal ’			0
mr @entity90 went on : ‘ we will bring to bear every resource , call in every promise , rattle every skeleton in every cupboard			2
this is a step too far by @entity29			0
’ making it clear that he sees the petition as a means of launching a @entity2 onslaught on the prime minister , mr @entity90 continued : ‘ @entity29 wants to sell out to @entity158 and powerful press interests because he is scared , and he is weak			1
but that is why he can not succeed – because he is weak			0
’ no chase : @entity47 chairman @entity46 said no legislation was needed to make newspapers sign up to an independent regulation system as 2,000 editors have already pledged to sign up yesterday @entity133 , former @entity49 editor , weighed into the debate			2
he warned : ‘ of course , everyone has been very nice to @entity12			2
but , in truth , this report is a sloppy , elephantine piece of work that relies on nobody having the time to read it before taking sides			0
’ @entity65 mp @entity176 said @entity2 had made a ‘ fatal error of judgment ’ in calling for the implementation of the report , which civil liberties campaigners have warned raises serious concerns			1
mr @entity176 , a member of the @entity183 , added : ‘ it is a huge but characteristic error of judgment on @entity90 ’s part to try and turn a legitimate debate on press regulation into a squalid partisan rant			2
’ all in law : the petition wants to implement every word of @entity12 's 2,000 page report fellow @entity65 committee member @entity194 said @entity2 ’s involvement would raise questions about the campaign ’s independence			1
he said : ‘ it rather undermines the impression that campaigners want to leave that this is a non-party political movement if @entity2 members are being agitated to sign this			1
’ hacked off yesterday boasted that its online petition had been signed by more than 100,000 – although critics have questioned the thoroughness of checks to ensure all signatures are genuine			2
a similar petition on the government ’s website , where all names are checked , has been signed by fewer than 5,000			0
@entity215 insisted that the petition remained a ‘ cross party ’ campaign			2
a spokesman said mr @entity90 had acted ‘ on his own initiative ’			0
@entity2 last night announced it will bring forward its own draft legislation before @entity222 to implement @entity12 ’s proposals , although it is backing away from mr @entity107 ’s original insistence that the broadcasting regulator @entity225 should oversee a new system of regulation			1
culture secretary @entity53 has already ordered officials to draw up a draft @entity229 , but has warned it will ‘ demonstrate our concerns ’ that new laws could be amended by @entity232 to curb free speech			1
@entity2 accused her of ‘ bad faith ’ and said its own proposals could form the basis of a pincer movement with the @entity63 to force the legislation on to the statute book .			0
