by @entity0 tractor beams evoke scenes from @entity3 and @entity4 , but scientists have swapped lasers for water to create a similar device			0
@entity10 physicists have developed technology that works in liquids and involves manipulating currents with wave generators			1
during tests , scientists used it to pull a ping pong ball towards the generator , as well as push it away			0
experts hope that one day the technology will be used to control oil spills , or even fleets of ships			1
this means the researchers can move objects at will , without touching them			1
the ' beam ' could be used to control oil spills , for example last year , a team from the @entity39 and the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) in the @entity41 built a laser capable of moving tiny spheres of polystyrene floating in water			1
the team fired a laser through a lens , which then went to a mirror that bounced the beam back			0
the reflected beam interfered with the incoming beam			0
meanwhile , the scientists suspended polystyrene spheres in water directly in the path of the laser beams			0
the beams held the spheres in place vertically , and any pulling or pushing force moved the spheres to the left or to the right			0
changing the way the light is polarised changes the direction the spheres move			0
the work could also reveal new insights into how waves on beaches occur			2
the technology was created by professor @entity71 and dr @entity72 from @entity27 's @entity73			1
‘ we have figured out a way of creating waves that can force a floating object to move against the direction of the wave , ’ said dr @entity72			1
‘ no one could have guessed this result , ’ he said			0
using a ping pong ball in a wave tank , the researchers used the size and frequency of the waves , when viewed through a slow - motion camera , to work out their different size and frequency			1
they were then able to manipulate these waves to move the ball in whichever direction they wanted			0
advanced particle tracking tools , developed by team members dr @entity98 and dr @entity99 , revealed that the waves generate currents on the surface of the water			2
using a ping pong ball in a wave tank , the researchers used the size and frequency of the waves , when viewed through a slow - motion camera , ( pictured ) to work out their different size and frequency			1
they were then able to manipulate these waves to move the ball in whichever direction they wanted ‘ we found that above a certain height , these complex three - dimensional waves generate flow patterns on the surface of the water , ’ professor @entity71 said			1
‘ the tractor beam is just one of the patterns , they can be inward flows , outward flows or vortices			2
’ ‘ it ’s one of the great unresolved problems , yet anyone in the bathtub can reproduce it			0
we were very surprised no - one had described it before			0
’ the team also experimented with different shaped plungers to generate different swirling flow patterns			1
‘ this work on the tractor beam began shortly after we realised the particle motion on the surface , as determined by waves , is by far too complex to handle with any existing mathematical theory , ’ said dr @entity72			1
advanced particle tracking tools , developed by team members dr @entity98 and dr @entity99 , revealed waves generate currents on the surface of the water ( illustration pictured )			2
using this , the researchers realised the particle motion on the surface is too complex to handle with any existing mathematical theory previous research into ' tractor beams ' have concentrated on moving objects using lasers , as seen in science fiction films and tv shows			2
the @entity158 from @entity3 ( pictured ) is shown using its tractor beam on a smaller spaceship			0

the ' beam ’ was created by physicists at the @entity27
it controls water flow patterns using plungers and wave generators
objects can be moved towards , or away , from the waves at will
@entity173 could be useful for *recovering* items that have gone *adrift* at sea
it could also be used control oil spills and teach researchers more about how waves occur on a beach
