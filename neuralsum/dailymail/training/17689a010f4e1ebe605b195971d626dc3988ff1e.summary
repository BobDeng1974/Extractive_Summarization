for most men , giving a father of the bride speech is one of the proudest moments of their lives			1
but after it consultant @entity6 was paralysed in a cycling accident , he feared he may have to address guests at his daughter 's wedding from a wheelchair			1
however , thanks to the latest in robotic technology , the 55 - year - old walked across the dance floor of a wedding venue last month and delivered his speech standing up			1
after undergoing a series of operations and spending 12 days in intensive care , he was left tetraplegic and needing a wheelchair to get around			2
when his daughter @entity26 announced she was to marry fiancé @entity43 , mr @entity6 feared he would be unable to walk his daughter down the aisle or deliver his speech standing up			1
but after he and wife @entity47 , 57 , met a representative of @entity49 at an exhibition of technologies for the disabled , he was lent the robotic suit to allow him to stand and walk			1
the legs contain 29 computer processors which communicate 3,000 a messages a second to each other the motors can carry a person weighing up to 15 stone have been used by 50 people , clocking up 4,000 hours of walking			0
they are currently estimated at costing £ 97,000 but makers believe they can get the price down to £ 40,000			2
the benefits are not confined to the mobility of users , as the upright position also reduces the risks of users developing other health problems			0
they are currently being tested by the @entity75 military in rehabilitation centres for wounded servicemen			0
he told @entity79 : ' the guests were gobsmacked when i walked out			1
it was the usual speech , thanking everyone for coming and hoping everybody had a good evening , but i certainly surprised them all with my entrance			1
' it was n't possible for a number of reasons for me to walk @entity26 down the aisle , but i was able to do my speech standing up			1
' it is quite an issue when you end up in a wheelchair , being at the wrong height compared to everybody else			0
but being able to speak to everybody from the right height did make quite a difference			0
' it made a difference to me in the sense that i was doing it from the right perspective			0
' the day was wonderful			0
it was everything you would hope your daughter 's wedding day to be			0
unfortunately i could not do everything i would have wanted to do , but this certainly helped			0
' mr @entity6 made the three - minute , 30 - pace walk across the hall of @entity114 , @entity115 last month to gasps from guests , who had no idea what he had planned			1
@entity26 , 29 , said : ' i knew what he was going to do but the only times he had tried it before , i had been at work , so it was still very emotional to see him walk across the room			0
' it was important to him to be able to do as much at the wedding as he would have been able to do before he had the accident , so it was amazing			2
' most of the guests knew him pre-accident and post-accident and for them it was pretty emotional too because it is nice to see him upright and at the same level as you			0
' wedding organisers played a soundtrack of @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 , and mr @entity6 said : ' there was n't a dry eye in the house '			2
mr @entity6 said the bionic legs made a huge difference to his experience of his daughter 's big day the ' exoskeleton suit ' , which is controlled by a joystick and a series of computers and motors , was lent to mr @entity6 for the day			1
mr @entity6 added : ' there are a number similar technologies being developed and they are all in very early stages			2
' it is worth about £ 97,000 so it is not something i could just stick on the credit card or be able to afford any time soon , but it made a big difference			2
' @entity164 , of charity aspire , who mr @entity6 supports , said : ' @entity6 has been a supporter of @entity165 since he was paralysed by a spinal cord injury in 2012 and we would like to congratulate him and his family on his daughter 's wedding			1
' one of our services is to provide adapted houses for spinal injured people to live in whilst they find suitable accessible accommodation			0
@entity6 lived in an @entity176 in @entity36 from april 2013 to march 2014 and since then has been a supporter of the charity , raising over £ 2,000			1
