by @entity1 reporter published : 21:58 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 23:53 est , 29 may 2013 fans of the @entity5 's comedian @entity4 put their relationships on the line to take part in another cruel prank			1
@entity4 , who recently encouraged teenagers to text their parents about a fake drug deal , took to @entity13 on wednesday to ask his 70,000 followers to send a message their partner saying : ' i have n't been fully honest with you '			1
in a cruel repeat of his drug deal prank , his followers were told to not respond to any texts or phone calls for one hour after sending the message			1
cruel : comedian @entity4 encouraged his @entity13 followers to text the person they are dating what might have seemed a funny idea at the time , quickly backfired as relationships were destroyed and trust lost			2
@entity30 was one of many who instantly regretted taking part in the prank			2
he later tweeted on @entity4 's page : ' thought it 'd be funny but now i completely regret it			0
2 years down the drain			0
' in a fit of anger , his now ex-girlfriend berated and belittled him , before confessing that she ' did hook up with your best friend on new years '			0
demands : many pleaded for more information , but the @entity13 followers had been told to stay quiet for an hour acceptance : some people took the cryptic message calmly , expressing a wish to ' end ' the relationship well one prank texter was ordered to ' find another place to sleep tonight ' , and several had their lives threatened by irate girlfriends			2
while nearly all jumped to conclusions , believing they had been cheated on , a few took the news better than expected			0
and while some made accusations , one woman 's response was to ask her boyfriend to delete ' all my stuff of ur phone n computer ... i 'm not tryna end up on world star '			2
an eye - catching response to one of @entity4 's fans , called @entity76 , read : ' this better not be @entity78 all over again , @entity76			0
call me back now or we 're done '			0
but others were already in on the joke			0
after demanding to know if ' this [ is ] about what you 've been doing at the " gym " , ' @entity82 texted back : ' are you going to tell me you got 2 grams for $ 40 next ? ' in reference to the star of @entity89 's last prank			1
caught out : while some were already in on the joke , for others the message brought up painful memories baffling : many hoping for a funny response to share on the comic 's @entity13 page were stumped by their replies one girl , who chose to text her mother rather than someone she was dating , received a shocking reply saying ' i was afraid u were gon na tell me u were out getting an abortion '			1
for others however , what started as a joke ended up eliciting confessions from their loved ones , or cliff - hanger responses such as one that simply read : ' me neither ... '			1
