by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:05 pm on 27th june 2011 @entity2 , the former governor of @entity3 , was today found guilty of trying to sell @entity6 's vacant @entity5 seat			1
he was convicted on 17 charges of corruption by a jury in @entity10 this afternoon , after a retrial on allegations he abused his power to extort money for campaign funds			1
as the verdicts were read out , the 54 - year - old turned to his defence lawyer and said : ' what happened ? '			2
then he sat back in his chair and whispered ' i love you ' to his wife , @entity24			1
he could now face up to 300 years in jail , although federal guidelines are likely to dictate he will end up with a much shorter sentence			0
he could now face up to 350 years in jail his wife broke down as the first guilty verdict was announced , collapsing into her brother 's arms			1
he stroked her hair as she started crying , and she kept shaking her head and saying ' no ' when the jurors left court			0
@entity2 spoke only briefly as the couple left the courthouse in @entity10			1
he told reporters : ' well , among the many lessons i 've learned from this whole experience is to try to speak a little bit less , so i 'm going to keep my remarks kind of short			0
in sombre tones , he continued : ' @entity24 and i are obviously very disappointed			1
' there 's not much left to say other than we want to get home to our little girls and talk to them and explain things to them and try to sort things out			2
and i 'm sure we 'll be seeing you			0
' the verdict was a bitter defeat for @entity2 , who had spent two - and - a - half years professing his innocence on reality tv shows and later on the witness stand			1
media scrum : as his emotional wife looks on , @entity2 speaks to reporters gathered outside the courthouse in @entity10 following the guilty verdict departure : @entity2 and his wife @entity24 drive away from the courthouse this afternoon it capped a long - running spectacle in which @entity2 became famous for blurting on a recorded phone call that his ability to appoint @entity6 's successor to the @entity5 was ' f * * * * ing golden ' and that he would n't let it go ' for f * * * * ing nothing '			1
his defence team had insisted that hours of @entity84 wire tap recordings were just the ramblings of a politician who liked to think out loud			0
the jury found him not - guilty on one charge , of soliciting a bribe from a toll road authority , and failed to reach an agreement on two more			2
the charges included wire fraud , attempted extortion , bribery and conspiracy			2
convicted : former @entity3 governor @entity2 was convicted on 11 counts relating to his attempt to trade president @entity6 's vacant @entity5 seat in exchange for campaign funds and personal advancement of those , 11 concerned his attempts to sell mr @entity6 's @entity5 seat for personal gain after he was elected to the @entity107 in 2008			1
today @entity2 was found guilty of 17 counts of corruption , which prosecutors divided into five separate incidents : @entity112 he was found guilty on 11 counts relating to his attempt to trade president @entity6 's seat in exchange for personal advancement			1
of those , eight were for wire fraud			0
they cover a number of calls in which he discussed the possibility of wealthy @entity123 donors founding a charitable organisation that he could head , in exchange for appointing @entity6 adviser @entity126 to the seat			0
they also include a conference call in which he discusses getting ' tangible , political support ' in exchange for appointing @entity133 representative @entity132 prosecutors said this ' support ' was $ 1.5million in funds from mr @entity132 's supporters			2
another call recorded him and his advisers discussing ' personal benefits ' in exchange for the @entity5 seat appointment			0
he was also found guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit extortion , and another of attempted extortion			2
he allegedly had an agreement with his brother , @entity148 , to demand things of personal value in exchange for the appointment			2
@entity153 he was found guilty on one count of wire fraud , one of attempted extortion and one of solicitation of a bribe			2
they all refer to his attempts to solicit $ 25,000 in campaign contributions from the hospital 's chief executive @entity163 in exchange for a state payment increase of paediatric doctors , and also in exchange for the state money for doctors treating @entity172 patients			2
@entity173 he was found guilty on one count of wire fraud , one of attempted extortion and one of solicitation of a bribe			2
these charges cover allegations he conspired with his former chief of staff @entity180 to extort a racetrack executive for campaign contributions in exchange for signing a bill to grant money to the racetrack industry			2
@entity188 jurors failed to reach a verdict on allegations he demanded campaign contributions from then - @entity133 representative @entity193 in exchange for a state grant to a school in mr @entity193 's district			2
@entity198 jurors failed to reach a verdict on allegations he attempted to extort campaign contributions from road - building executive @entity203 in return for giving state money to the @entity207			0
they found him not guilty on one count , ' solicitation of a bribe ' , concerning allegations he asked mr @entity203 for campaign money in exchange for approving a multi-billion dollar @entity207 improvement plan			0
@entity2 was also found guilty of holding up official acts on the @entity198 , a school grant , horse - racing legislation and the @entity153 while he demanded campaign contributions			1
he has now been barred from travelling outside the northern @entity3 area without permission , and the judge set a status hearing for sentencing on august 1			0
federal guidelines and previous sentences handed down to other @entity3 politicians guilty of corruption suggest he could get around ten years in prison			1
but judges have a huge amount of discretion , and can factor in a host of variables - including whether a defendant took the stand and lied , something prosecutors say @entity2 did			1
he arrived at court with his wife @entity24 after judge @entity239 said the verdicts would be read this afternoon			1
the former governor told reporters gathered outside his home this morning : ' my hands are shaking , my knees are weak			0
' he said he was praying for the best , but added : ' it ’s in @entity249 ’s hands			0
' the jury had spent three weeks talking through the evidence			0
@entity2 was originally tried last year , but the jury came back deadlocked after deliberating for 14 days , the the judge ordered a retrial			1
they agreed on just one of 24 counts , convicting @entity2 of lying to the @entity84			1
he faces up to five years on that conviction			0
today 's verdict makes @entity2 the second @entity3 governor in a row to be convicted of corruption			1
his predecessor , former governor @entity262 , is serving a six - and - a - half year jail sentence			0
prosecutors , defence attorneys and dozens of reporters filed into the courtroom today after the judge announced it had received word of a note from jurors			0
judge @entity239 said : ' the jury has come to a decision on 18 of the 20 counts			0
' he added that the jurors said they were deadlocked on two counts and ' were confident ' they could n't agree on those charges ' even with further deliberations			0
' asked how he should respond , both prosecutors and the defence indicated to @entity285 that the jury had deliberated long enough and should be asked to deliver the verdicts			0
it was only the third note from jurors in their deliberations			0
the two other gave no hint about how deliberations were proceeding			0
@entity2 was arrested in december 2008 , after the @entity84 had wiretapped hundreds of his telephone calls at work and home			1
the @entity296 impeached him a month later			0
both trials hinged on whether the former governor 's bold ramblings to aides and others on the telephone was just talk , as he insisted , or part of ' a political crime spree ' , in the words of @entity133 attorney @entity306			1
the case became a media spectacle , with the indicted governor and his wife appearing on television reality shows			1
the loquacious @entity2 made theatrical appearances daily outside the courthouse during the first trial to profess his innocence and hug his remaining fans			1
emotional : @entity2 was uncharacteristically brief as he spoke after being found guilty of corruption , including trying to sell the @entity5 seat once held by @entity6 mobbed : @entity2 and hiws wife @entity24 almost disappear as a scrum of reporters gather outside @entity10 's @entity323 in a case full of high - level name dropping , defence attorneys in the retrial pulled into court @entity10 's new mayor @entity193 and @entity133 representative @entity132 mr @entity193 's appearance on the witness stand , the most anticipated by a @entity10 mayor in a federal courtroom in decades , was over in just five minutes			1
@entity132 was done in about half an hour			0
overall , though , the retrial had far less of the circus - like atmosphere that accompanied the initial trial			0
@entity2 himself also was more subdued this time			1
prosecutors dropped racketeering counts against the ex-governor and dismissed all charges against his then co-defendant brother , @entity342			1
when there was still hope : @entity2 and his wife leave their home in @entity10 this morning , left , and right , a wellwisher offers the shamed former governor a hug of support they presented just three weeks of evidence - half the time taken at the first trial			1
they called fewer witnesses , asked fewer questions and played shorter excerpts of the @entity84 wiretaps that underpin most of the charges			0
there was also a new variable at the retrial : the testimony from @entity2 himself			1
at the first trial , the defence rested without calling any witnesses and @entity2 did n't testify despite vowing that he would			2
retrial jurors saw a deferential @entity2 look them in the eyes and deny every allegation , telling them his talk on the recordings was mere brainstorming			2
this time , jurors must decide if they believe him .			0

@entity2 guilty on 17 of 20 corruption charges
former governor says : ' @entity24 and i are obviously very disappointed . i frankly am stunned '
wife sobs on brother 's shoulder as she hears verdicts
