by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 07:56 est , 17 august 2012 an injured cuckoo who was flown business class to @entity4 to catch up with her migration trip has now completed an emotional release back into the wild			1
@entity8 , a two - year - old cuckoo , set off for her epic migration from @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , with four male companions but soon found herself in trouble			1
she made it only as far as @entity17 in @entity18 , where she was discovered the worse for wear in a garden , malnourished and emaciated and unable to carry her gps tag which allows scientists to track her movements			2
comfortable : @entity8 was flown to @entity4 by @entity24 to continue her epic journey but after a month of care at the @entity27 in nearby @entity28 , she was flown to @entity4 by @entity24 to continue her epic journey , crossing the @entity30 and then the @entity31 before finally arriving in the @entity32			1
cuckoos tend to leave @entity34 during july or early august			2
@entity8 was travelling in her own seat – a business class one would have cost £ 379 if booked this month – and was accompanied on the flight from @entity38 by vet nurse @entity39 from @entity27			1
flying high : the cuckoo settles into her business class seat - and she slept for almost all of the journey only the best : the cuckoo had to go through security and even had a taste of the business class lounge almost immediately after releasing her the cuckoo called back to her travel partner - a touching moment which provoked a flood of tears			1
ms @entity39 said : ' all through the build up to @entity8 ’s flight and release i was so nervous , i just thought ‘ something is going to go wrong ’			2
' but @entity24 were amazing and everybody at the airport knew what was going on when we arrived			0
' we went through the security and whizzed straight through to our business class lounge - something i ’ve never experienced before			0
' we did n’t have to queue to get onto the plane either - in fact everyone parted to let us through - we were treated like royalty , it was surreal			0
' @entity8 was very brave throughout the flight , she actually slept the whole way and it was me that was constantly leaning over to see if she was ok			0
' she is such an awesome bird and a real calm character			1
' the pair touched down in @entity78 and were greeted by two @entity80 students , @entity81 and @entity82 , who had helped organise @entity8 ’s release			0
she was let off into the wild from the @entity85 in @entity86 near @entity78			0
the plan was to release the @entity8 the day after arriving but ms @entity88 felt it was in the bird ’s best interests to do it sooner rather than later			1
flying without wings : @entity24 staff carry the cuckoo through the terminal before she was released and as the @entity98 had heard the call of a nearby cuckoo very recently , it was agreed to release that same day			1
ms @entity39 added : ' i am so grateful to @entity81 and @entity82 , they knew exactly what the best release site was for @entity8 - it was a gorgeous place			0
' actually letting her go was very emotional as i had got quite attached to her - there were a few tears shed , but it was happy crying			0
' i think the sudden realisation set in that i would probably never see her again , but it was a moving experience			0
free : the cuckoo was let off into the wild from the @entity85 in @entity86 near @entity78 ' she did n’t fly straight off but instead went and sat pruning herself in a tree for about half an hour and feasted on the many caterpillars on the tree			2
' she then called back to me which was incredible as i had never heard her make a sound in the month that i ’ve known her			2
' it was a real goose - bump moment but it was at that point when all my previous concerns disappeared			0
new life : @entity39 said she had goosebumps when the cuckoo flew off but then she say pruning herself in a tree @entity128 voyage : the little bird is hitching a lift to @entity78 in @entity4 on her way to the @entity32 ' part of me , selfishly , would love to know how she gets on but she is not tagged now and of course i know that is for the best			1
' it was a hell of a privilege to have dealt with @entity8 because in 21 years of being a vet nurse she is the first cuckoo i have seen			2
' to come back without her felt really strange but it was certainly an experience i shall never forget			0
' she was not flown straight to @entity143 because at this stage of her migration it is too early .			1

after a month of care the cuckoo was flown to @entity4 to continue her migration
the bird travelled in its own seat which would have cost a *passenger* £ 379
