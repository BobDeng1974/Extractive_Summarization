five years to the day since his arrest in @entity3 on espionage charges , @entity1 ' wife has declared that the former @entity6 government subcontractor is ' done for '			1
' i am afraid that we are at the end			0
after five years of literally wasting away , @entity1 is done , ' @entity10 said in a statement , adding that her 65 - year - old husband now appears gaunt , hobbling and missing five teeth			1
@entity3 arrested the @entity15 resident on december 3 , 2009 , and later convicted him to 15 years in prison for importing banned technology and trying to establish clandestine internet service for @entity3 jews			1
happier times : @entity1 with his wife @entity21 before his arrest on december 3 , 2009 - @entity3 convicted him to 15 years in jail for importing banned technology and trying to set up clandestine web service for @entity26 @entity1 ' fate now largely hinges on @entity28 trying to improve ties between @entity3 and the @entity6 ' it is time for president @entity28 to bring @entity1 back to the @entity6 now ; otherwise it will be too late , ' his wife urged this week			1
in light of @entity1 ' five - year anniversary behind bars , the @entity33 called on @entity3 for his release , with press secretary @entity38 saying in a press release that the @entity6 remains ' deeply concerned ' about the @entity6 's health			1
@entity38 said @entity1 ' release ' would remove an impediment to more constructive relations ' between the two countries			0
the case is emblematic of bitter @entity6 - @entity3 relations dating to the 1959 revolution that brought @entity48 to power , and any potential breakthrough appears remote while @entity1 is still in prison			1
as he recently did on immigration , @entity28 could move without congressional approval to relax @entity6 rules that require most @entity6 wanting to visit @entity3 to go on expensive , organized trips with @entity6 - approved agendas			1
such a change could generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year for @entity3 's centrally planned economy , which is struggling for cash in the absence of major expansions in foreign investment or private economic activity			2
@entity3 authorities this week sharply downgraded their prediction of 2014 growth to 1.3 per cent , nearly a point lower than expected at the beginning of the year			0
bring him home : supporters rally on behalf of imprisoned @entity6 citizen @entity1 - his fate now largely hinges on @entity28 trying to improve ties between @entity3 and the @entity6 observers in both countries warn , however , that expectations of imminent progress have come and gone before without real change to relations that have been tense for more than five decades			1
' we wo n't make enough progress obviously until he 's home , ' @entity80 spokeswoman @entity79 said of @entity1 on tuesday			0
' his continued incarceration represents a significant impediment to a more constructive bilateral relationship			0
' @entity1 ' wife , @entity21 , said in a written statement that the contractor has lost more than 100 pounds , can barely walk due to chronic pain , and has lost five teeth and much of the sight in his right eye			2
the married father - of - one has begun refusing to see his family and members of @entity3 's small @entity98 community , who had been visiting him on religious holidays			2
backers in the @entity6 said @entity1 has begun discussing a hunger strike , a tactic he has used in the past			2
' he has n't been seeing anyone for a while , ' said @entity106 , vice president of the @entity108 - based jewish community association			0
@entity106 said he hoped @entity1 would accept a visit for @entity111 celebrations this month			0
' we maintain our hope that he will see us and keep his @entity98 faith alive , and his faith that maybe this coming year he can return to his country , ' @entity106 said .			0

@entity1 was arrested in @entity3 on december 3 2009 while working *covertly* in the @entity119 - run country to set up internet access
he was later convicted to 15 years in prison for importing banned technology
since being behind bars his *condition* has *deteriorated*
his wife , @entity21 , now fears that he is close to death
the 65 - year - old 's fate now largely hinges on @entity28 trying to improve ties between @entity3 and the @entity6
