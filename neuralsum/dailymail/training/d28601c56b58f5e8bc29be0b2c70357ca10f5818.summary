a @entity1 venture plans to use a remote - controlled ' stealth ' airship to hunt for signs of @entity4 in the mountains of @entity6			1
the @entity7 claims to be the first organisation to employ an airborne strategy in an attempt to detect evidence of the semi-mythical hominid			1
they hope to use a helium - filled airship carrying thermal imaging and high resolution wireless cameras to approach and observe @entity4 with ' minimal or no disturbance of the subject ’s natural behaviour '			1
described as a large , bipedal hairy humanoid creature living in remote wilderness areas of the @entity1 and @entity41 , @entity4 - also known as @entity4 - has only ever been pictured once in grainy footage			1
the evidence for the existence of what is believed could be a species of @entity48 ape is almost entirely supported by anecdotal evidence , tracks and hair samples classified as an unidentified primate			0
some claim it is a creature which may be found around the world under different regional names , such as the @entity57 , or is at least a closely related species			2
now the @entity7 , founded by @entity59 , a gold dredger who claims to have sighted @entity4 in 1997 , hopes to gather definitive proof that @entity4 exists in the form of clear , steady film footage of the creature in its natural habitat			1
the only video evidence so far : this film was shot in @entity6 in 1967 by former rodeo rider @entity69			0
the @entity26 team hope to capture fresh indisputable footage the only video evidence of @entity4 captured to date is the famous @entity69 film captured by former rodeo rider @entity69 in @entity6 in 1967			1
the film has been subject to many debunking attempts but mr @entity69 insisted on its authenticity until his death in 1972			0
now the @entity7 team hope that any fresh video evidence of the sasquatch could earn them an ' instantaneous windfall in the hundreds of thousands of dollars			1
' ' @entity84 was formed for the purpose of acquiring motion picture evidence of a @entity88 , ' the company says			0
' our competitive advantage , relative to other @entity88 research organizations , is that we are employing technology that no one else possesses			0
' the project will use an unmanned 45ft dual airship - the @entity25 - equipped with a proprietary propulsion system to give it a claimed top speed of 35 - 45mph , manoeuvrable ' with the degree of precision necessary to track a fast - moving animal '			2
@entity4 is described in reports as a large hairy ape - like creature , in a range of 6 – 10ft tall , weighing in excess of 500lb , and covered in dark brown or dark reddish hair			1
self - styled witnesses have described large eyes , a pronounced brow ridge , and a large , low - set forehead ; the top of the head has been described as rounded and crested , similar to the sagittal crest of the male gorilla			0
@entity4 is commonly reported to have a strong , unpleasant smell by those who claim to have encountered it			1
the enormous footprints for which it is named have been as large as 24in long and 8in wide			0
while most casts have five toes — like all known apes — some casts of alleged @entity4 tracks have had numbers ranging from two to six			1
some have also contained claw marks , making it likely that a portion came from known animals such as bears , which have five toes and claws			0
some proponents have claimed that @entity4 is omnivorous and mainly nocturnal			1
cameras that can view and film in infrared , thermal imaging and @entity138 will be fitted onto the @entity25 using a gyro - stabilised camera mount so that if @entity4 is located the images will be clear and steady			1
the @entity25 will be deployed in selected areas of appropriate habitat where reports suggest sasquatch may range			0
the @entity7 claim the stealth and manoeuvrability of the airship gives it major advantages over helicopter and fixed - wing aircraft			1
the company says : ' from what research suggests , everything that we have done on the ground has been ineffective in getting close to them ; therefore a perspective from the sky , with an imaging platform to zoom in on them quickly and track their position , seems to be the most logical way for us to pursue motion picture evidence			2
@entity4 expert : dr @entity167 of @entity168 will coordinate the research as principal investigator on the project ' we believe that this ground - breaking technology will give us the element of surprise in catching @entity88 on film			1
' a dual airship can track a @entity88 even if it is running at top speed or climbing a mountain			0
a human on foot can not			0
' further , the dual airship will provide the best chance at obtaining the long - awaited steady camera that has , as yet , been missing from all films of @entity88 in existence , because our dual airship will be fitted with a gyro to provide image stabilization			0
' the research is to be coordinated through @entity168 , with dr @entity167 , professor of anatomy and anthropology , acting as principal investigator			0
dr @entity167 , one of the few academics to back the existence of @entity4 , has been probing the question of sasquatch ’s existence for nearly 17 years , ever since examining a line of inexplicable 15in bipedal footprints in south - eastern @entity199			2
he is the author of one of the most authoritative treatments of the subject , @entity4 : legend meets science and has published a number of scientific papers examining the footprint evidence			2
dr @entity167 said : ' even if definitive dna sequence data point to the existence of a novel species it will not suddenly become easy to study such a rare and elusive primate in the field			0
' that ’s where the @entity7 comes in			2
' most scientists discount the existence of @entity4 and consider apparent sightings to be a combination of folklore , misidentification and hoax .			2

@entity7 claims to be the first to employ an airborne strategy to track down the elusive creature which has never been proven to exist
they hope capturing reliable footage of @entity4 could net an ' instantaneous windfall in the hundreds of thousands of dollars . '
