locked - in sufferers , who are fully conscious but completely paralysed , could soon be given the ability to communicate with their loved ones			1
the breakthrough follows the development of two portable ' mind readers ' that combine the use of vibrating pads and an electrode cap to measure a patient 's brain signals			2
scientists say these could help prevent people being misdiagnosed as being in a vegetative state , when in reality they can understand everything going on around them			1
the breakthrough follows the development of two portable ' mind readers ' ( pictured ) that combine the use of vibrating pads and an electrode cap to measure a patient 's brain signals up until now , huge @entity23 scanners were one of the only hope for locked - in patients to communicate , according to a report by @entity28 in the @entity29			1
previous tests had shown success in communicating with people in a locked - in state by concentrating on the specific words , ' yes ' or ' no ' while inside the scanner			1
by studying their brain activity using electrodes , researchers have shown that they can accurately read their answers			2
@entity40 of @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , has been developing a system that involves placing vibrating pads on someone 's arm , and then asking them to focus on one vibrator			0
the idea is that paying attention to a sense - like vibration creates electrical signals in the brain that are much easier to read than eye movements			2
locked - in sufferers , who are fully conscious but completely paralysed , could soon be given the ability to communicate with their loved ones			1
pictured is an example of how the brain lights up when someone with locked in syndrome reacts to the question ' are you married ? ' last year , a man diagnosed as being in a vegetative state was able to follow the plot of a short @entity71 film			1
doctors believed the 34 - year - old @entity43 was left entirely unresponsive after suffering a cardiac arrest 16 years ago			2
but scans taken while the patient was shown ' @entity76 ' revealed brain activity linked to feelings of anticipation and excitement			2
the brain patterns resembled that of healthy participants , suggesting not only that the patient was consciously aware , but also that he understood the film			0
' for the first time , we show that a patient with unknown levels of consciousness can monitor and analyse information from their environment , in the same way as healthy individuals , ' said @entity95 , a researcher at the @entity41			0
' we already know that up to one in five of these patients are misdiagnosed as being unconscious and this new technique may reveal that that number is even higher			0
' ' @entity101 stimulation works very well			0
' professor @entity40 told @entity29			0
' we have had some successes			0
' an @entity104 company , called g.tec , has developed a similar system using vibrating pads on a patient 's wrists and then measuring their brain waves			1
according to the @entity29 , the @entity111 in @entity112 has successfully tested it on people with classic locked - in syndrome by asking them to count the vibrations felt			1
by analysing their brain activity using electrodes , researchers have shown that they can accurately read their answers			0
professor @entity40 's has previously shown that some people described as being in a ' vegetative state ' could understand and follow instructions			1
up until now , huge @entity23 scanners ( pictured ) were one of the only hopes for locked - in patients to communicate several years ago , his team used @entity23 to show that one in five people in vegetated states could think about playing tennis or walking around their home			1
in september , a man diagnosed as being in a vegetative state has been able to follow the plot of a short @entity71 film			1
doctors believed the 34 - year - old @entity43 was left entirely unresponsive after suffering a cardiac arrest 16 years ago			0

locked - in sufferers are fully conscious but completely paralysed
devices that analyse brain waves can allow them to communicate
previously this analysis could only be done in a large @entity23 scanner
now two separate research *groups* have created a portable *version*
it could prevent people being misdiagnosed as in a vegetative state
