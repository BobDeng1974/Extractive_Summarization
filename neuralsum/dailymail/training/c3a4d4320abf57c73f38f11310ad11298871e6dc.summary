his tool is a @entity17 with a fish eye lens			0
the ultra-wide angle fish eye creates a wide panoramic picture			0
the camera is then cased into a waterproof box			2
the wave breaks in water less than 2ft feet deep and the sand gets sucked off the sea floor and into the wave pictured : a shot from behind a breaking wave looking towards shore			1
here , the photographer is under water and the curve of the wave distorts the beach scene elongating the palm trees wave photographer @entity24 captured this picture during a morning photo session from inside the tube at @entity44 , @entity46 's most famous surf break			1
breaking on a very shallow reef , this spot is known as one of the deadliest waves in the world surf photographer mr @entity2 , 44 , pictured here inside a tube wave as it breaks on @entity11 , @entity56 , @entity10			1
his tool is a @entity17 with a fish eye lens , cased in a waterproof box			0
the ultra-wide angle fish eye creates a wide panoramic picture mr @entity2 looks out of a glassy @entity63 barrel during sunset on @entity65 in @entity63 holding a waterproof camera with an attached strobe flash , the photographer throws himself down on the sand as the wave pitches over and creates an opening with a sunset view in the distance so as not to lose his valuable tool when tossed around by a wave , the camera is tied to a leash attached to his ankle			1
the photographer presses the trigger and the camera then fires out an impressive nine to 10 frames per second			2
not only does the 10lb camera come into the ocean with him , the photographer also drags in tools such as strobe lights so that he can capture the scene perfectly			2
and no wave fazes mr @entity2 , who has been hurtled into waves as high as 15ft before being thrown back down to the ground			1
as he swims , he passes marine wildlife on his way , wearing flippers to help him glide through the ocean			0
although his career started out in his native hawaii , mr @entity2 travels the world to land the perfect picture - capturing some of the world 's biggest waves as he goes			1
mr @entity2 started out as a surfer in the 80s and spent two decades riding the waves before discovering his passion			1
as a surfer , his talent lay in riding shore break waves - waves which break close to the shore - and coming out in one piece			0
then , in 2007 , his wife , @entity110 , asked him to take a photograph of a wave breaking for their house			0
the surfer stood up to the challenge , bought a cheap camera and threw himself into the wave			0
he has been photographing the water hurtling down to the shore ever since and has exhibited his pictures across the world from @entity123 to @entity124			2
an endangered @entity125 ( @entity126 in @entity125 ) swimming behind a breaking wave in the shallow waters off of the @entity11 , @entity56 , @entity10 a large wave is captured laying on the dry sand as it throws over to create the shorebreak barrel			1
seconds after the shot , mr @entity2 was washed up onto the beach - his whole body covered in sand two waves crash sending water flying into the sky on @entity11 in @entity10 it 's the golden hour : a wave captured in the early morning looking straight into the sunrise , @entity11 , @entity56 , @entity10 the surf photographer is pictured here lining up his perfect shot moments before the wave is about to crash onto him he describes his vision as photographing the waves ' inside out '			1
the photographer spends his days in the water because : ' i love to be in the ocean and i love to take pictures of mother nature			2
' i have a major passion for being in the ocean and capturing these images , ' he said			0
in an interview with @entity159 , mr @entity2 said : ' i 'm getting right into the perfect spot			2
' i 'm just holding the trigger and the adrenaline 's pumping because i want to get the best shot			0
but at the same time you 're going to get pummeled			0
the sun and its rays captured in the arc of the wave on @entity11 , @entity56 , @entity10 in this early morning shot			2
mr @entity2 often leaves his house in the pitch black to capture the sun as it rises the silhouette of a surfer @entity174 is frozen the moment before he jumps off the back of his surfboard			1
the flash was supposed to go off and set the scene alight			0
instead , the true light from inside the wave is perfectly captured a classic @entity63 setting captured from a new perspective : @entity184 shot by mr @entity2 from inside the tube mr @entity2 is pictured here grabbing onto his camera before snapping the inside of the tube as it crashes onto him			1
the waterproof camera housing has a safety leash attached to his wrist so the camera is not lost if the unit is ripped from his hand this is the breathtaking moment two waves collide and send a fan of water upwards in front of the setting sun to create a stunning image ' so i kind of hold my breath and a lot of times i get sucked up , a lot times i get sucked up into the falls			1
' the results of the photographer 's time in the water are breathtaking , but mainly mr @entity2 says he throws himself in , wave after wave , because he has ' a great time '			1
sometimes he has to tuck his camera under his arm to stop it from being dragged away by the ocean			0
' or , i get in the featal position and hope for the best , ' he said			0
@entity24 's latest coffee table book ' @entity217 ' includes over 100 shots from @entity10 , @entity123 and @entity63			2
