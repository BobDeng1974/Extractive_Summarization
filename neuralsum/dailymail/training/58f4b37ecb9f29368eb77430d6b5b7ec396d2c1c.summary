with her long blonde hair , glowing skin and elegant sense of style , @entity5 , from @entity6 , looks far younger than her 64 years			1
but there 's more to the @entity6 grandmother than meets the eye			1
although she looks like any other retiree , @entity5 , or @entity12 as she likes to be called , is a working escort			1
one of a growing number of pensionable prostitutes , @entity12 is part of a select group of elderly sex workers that counts the likes of @entity22 's @entity21 sisters and @entity24 's grandmother , @entity23 , among their number			2
@entity26 : 64 - year - old grandmother @entity5 still works as an escort , which , she says , pays her bills @entity12 's career in prostitution began more than 30 years ago when her husband , a compulsive gambler , played one round too many and left @entity12 and her children destitute			1
although financially stable now , @entity12 says she will continue to work as an escort for as long as she has bills to pay but adds that she would give it up if she could			1
' i started out because my husband was a gambler and we lost everything , ' she explains in an exclusive interview with @entity44			1
' then i saw an advert in the paper for escorts so i went for an interview and they told me to start right away			0
' i thought it was just going to be dinners and things but i got into the car and this man enlightened me on what was actually going to happen			0
' gambling : @entity5 's career began 30 years ago after her husband 's gambling left the family destitute @entity12 , who says she has never worked as a street prostitute , says the career did take some getting used to but says there are some benefits			1
' it does take some getting used to , ' she reveals			0
' essentially you are using your body and it is a bit like selling a piece of meat			0
' it 's just a job like working in a post office			0
it 's a bit like social services in the way that you have to analyse people			0
' according to @entity12 , who appears on @entity81 documentary , my granny @entity84 , analytical skills prove particularly useful when deciding which men to take on as clients			2
' i have had some really lovely clients and most of them are single , although there are a few that are married , ' she explains			0
' i have never suffered any violence - i wo n't have it			2
you just have to look at the client and watch out for drink and drugs , you just have to be aware			0
' making sure you 're aware of what 's going on is something she regularly says to younger escorts , many of whom she takes under her wing			0
sister act : @entity105 ( left ) and @entity21 worked in @entity22 's @entity106 for more than 50 years still working : @entity24 's granny , @entity23 , continues to work as an escort despite being 85 years old ' i tell them to just be careful because you are very vulnerable , ' she reveals			1
' there are lots of things i wo n't do that these younger girls will , i wo n't put myself or my family in those situations			1
i always do things my way			0
' @entity12 's clients , many of whom are in their 20s , also prefer a gentler approach with few asking for anything extreme			0
' i asked a guy the other day why he wanted to see an older woman and he said it was all to do with the fantasy , ' she explains			1
' they say they like an older lady because she knows what she 's doing and they know that they are in safe hands and wo n't grab hold of them too hard			1
they do n't want me to be naughty			2
' announcement : @entity23 said her granddaughter 's @entity141 stardom ruined her escorting career @entity144 : @entity23 with her granddaughter , 2010 @entity141 contestant , @entity24 ( pictured right ) perhaps that 's why , for now at least , @entity12 says she 's happy to carry on with her escort work			1
' i still enjoy my job , ' she reveals			2
' i enjoy meeting people			2
everyone always says that the sex must be the best part but not everyone has sex because they do n't want to commit adultery			2
i would say that around one in five clients have sex			0
' everyone has bills to pay so that 's why i still do it but i do enjoy it			1
' she adds , smiling broadly : ' i could go back to lorry driving , i did do that for a while			0
