this is the moment a @entity2 turkey was roasted on the world 's most expensive cooker - a £ 300,000 @entity5			0
car blogger @entity6 , from @entity7 , bought a fresh turkey and put the festive bird on the end of a pitchfork			1
he then bravely stood behind the 700bhp @entity12 and got the owner of the supercar to rev as hard as he could			2
mr @entity6 , who makes @entity29 videos under the name @entity30 , stood while the bird was given the alternative @entity2 roasting for more than ten minutes			2
the result was a browned turkey - although the high octane method is unlikely to replace the oven around the country any time soon			0
danger : the bird is placed near the engine before the owner revs with mr @entity6 just inches from the flames heat : mr @entity6 stood behind the 700bhp @entity12 and got the owner of the supercar to rev extreme : as the @entity24 motor reached a whopping 9,000 revs , huge flames spewed from its exhaust expensive : the £ 300,000 car which was used for the cooking experiment - but is better suited to driving he said : ' it is a standard @entity2 ritual that i collect the turkey for our family lunch and this year i thought i 'd try a new way to cook it			1
' i 'm not sure i 'd recommend this though unless you enjoy the taste of exhaust gases			0

car blogger @entity6 bought a turkey and put it on the end of a pitchfork
