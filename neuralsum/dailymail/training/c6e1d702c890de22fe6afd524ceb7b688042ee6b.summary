a mother risked her own health for that of her unborn son when she delayed having chemotherapy until he was born			1
@entity6 , 36 , was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was just 31 weeks pregnant			1
she decided to delay chemotherapy treatment to give her baby boy the best chance of being born healthy			1
@entity11 , now nine months old , was born on christmas eve last year and mrs @entity6 started her treatment for breast cancer just ten days later			1
@entity6 , 36 , was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was just 31 weeks pregnant but decided to delay chemotherapy treatment until after her son @entity11 , now nine months old , was born mrs @entity6 was able to breast feed @entity11 for ten days before starting chemotherapy treatment after undergoing chemotherapy , radiotherapy and a mastectomy , she is now on the road to recovery			1
mrs @entity6 , from @entity22 , @entity23 , said she does not regret delaying her treatment			1
she said : ' it was n't a difficult decision - our baby had to come first			0
' the cancer could have spread because we 'd delayed the treatment			2
sitting in the waiting room to find out with my ten day old baby was the most terrifying moment of my life			1
' if i 'd had treatment during my pregnancy then every time @entity11 got sick i would be questioning if it was my fault			1
' i could n't have lived with that			0
' mrs @entity6 and husband @entity40 , 35 , found out they were expecting a baby in june last year			1
they had always wanted a little brother or sister for their six - year - old son @entity46 , but after five years , the pregnancy came as a surprise			0
mrs @entity6 , a dentist , said : ' @entity11 was a very wanted baby , but i was working full time and having another baby had just gone to the back of my mind			1
' we were delighted when we found out			0
' my boobs got a lot bigger and both were lumpy during my pregnancies - it was the way i knew i was pregnant in the first place - but as i got further into this one i realised one of them was getting smaller			0
' i knew something was n't right , so i made an appointment with the midwife			0
' i was very lucky she took me seriously			0
i have since heard stories of other women my age being fobbed off because they are " too young for breast cancer "			1
@entity11 was born on christmas eve , and his parents were delighted that @entity46 , six , had a little brother breast cancer during pregnancy is very rare , occurring in about 1 in 3,000 pregnancies			1
most women are between 32 and 38 years old when they are diagnosed			0
during pregnancy , a woman 's breasts change in readiness for breastfeeding , with the breast tissue becoming more dense			0
this can make it more difficult to find changes in the breast that are due to cancer , such as a lump			1
in fact , research shows that during pregnancy , there is often a delay in diagnosis in women who get breast symptoms			2
of those women diagnosed with cancer , most are able to carry on with their pregnancy			2
rarely , some may need to think about whether to end the pregnancy ( termination )			0
but usually this is only necessary if chemotherapy is needed and the woman is less than 14 weeks pregnant			1
usually it is possible to delay chemotherapy treatment until after the 14 week stage			1
source : @entity109 following an examination by her midwife and her gp , mrs @entity6 was urgently referred to the @entity113			1
further tests over the next two weeks confirmed her worst fears - that she had breast cancer			1
she said : ' it did n't come as a shock to me because of my medical background			0
by the time i was seen by the breast unit , the nipple was already being pulled to one side and the skin under my nipple was puckered due to the spreading cancer			2
' i had n't told @entity40 at that point because i did n't want to worry him when i had no proof , but when i did he was incredible			0
' he came straight to the next appointment with me , where we were told about treatment			0
' mr and mrs @entity6 then faced the agonising decision of whether to start her chemotherapy straight away or delay it until after @entity11 was born , risking that the cancer would spread further			1
mrs @entity6 said : ' there was an option for me to start chemotherapy straight away , with a reduced - strength drug , given weekly instead of once every three weeks			1
' but i was already 33 weeks pregnant and it was n't certain that i would see out the course before giving birth			2
' there was also little evidence of what the drugs could do to my baby in the long term and it would have meant i could n't breastfeed him when he was born			2
' i had breastfed my first son until he was nine months old			2
i loved it and felt it gave the best of starts for the baby			0
' @entity40 and i discussed it and we decided we needed to put him first			0
' in the end , mrs @entity6 was induced three weeks early and @entity11 was born on christmas eve , weighing 5lb 8oz			1
she she said she tried to keep @entity161 as normal as possible for @entity46 and opened presents in the hospital as a family			0
mrs @entity6 is now at home enjoying time with her two boys @entity46 , six and @entity11 , nine months old at their family home in @entity22 , @entity23 she was then able to breastfeed @entity11 for 10 days before she started chemotherapy on january 3 this year			1
she said : ' i was worrying about making the switch , but because it was just 10 days , @entity11 did it no problem			2
' with all the " breast is best " publicity i was worried about him , but i need n't have			0
he has grown into a perfectly healthy little baby			2
' she endured six rounds of chemotherapy at full strength , but then developed an infection which delayed her mastectomy until june			2
seven weeks after the surgery she started radiotherapy , which finished three weeks ago			2
she now must have a chemotherapy injection every three weeks until march , and after that will take tablets for the next 10 years to help prevent the cancer coming back			2
mrs @entity6 said : ' i do n't regret the decision for a second			1
' i could never have forgiven myself if i 'd had the treatment while pregnant and something had happened to @entity11			1
' mrs @entity6 and husband @entity40 , 35 , a strategic manger were ' delighted ' when they discovered she was pregnant with her second child as it came as a surprise her husband , a strategic manager , has now carried out a charity swim for @entity200 and they are hoping to raise money for the oncology unit at the @entity113			1
he said : ' i never thought that i would be 34 years old and being told my wife has cancer			0
' my main worry was the boys			0
to not have their mum around from an early age would have been devastating			0
' we worked through the problem together and decided to get the baby here first			0
' spending @entity161 in hospital was different , but we made it work			0
' we could n't have asked for more from @entity6 's treatment			2
' [ the local charity ] @entity200 were also there for us the whole time			0
they had chats with the whole family to make sure everyone was okay			0
' the swim raised around Â£ 1,300 and we are now looking to do something for the oncology unit			0
