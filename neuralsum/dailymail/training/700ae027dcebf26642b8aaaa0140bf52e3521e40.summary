just this morning , the @entity0 attended the opening of @entity2 dressed in her full @entity4 finery			1
the @entity5 was perched on her perfect candyfloss curls and her diminutive figure was shrouded in the impressive 18ft fur - trimmed @entity8			1
hours later though , the monarch cut a very different figure as she hunkered down under a headscarf ( @entity13 , naturally ) and navy raincoat against the grim @entity16 weather			1
at times , as the rain drizzled down and the corners of her headscarf blew about in the breeze , the monarch 's mouth was set in a grim line			2
but appearances can be deceiving and the @entity0 , attending the first day of the @entity25 , would likely have been in her element			0
what a difference ! @entity32 , the @entity0 this afternoon at the @entity25 , and right , wearing the @entity28 , her @entity30 crystal - studded dress and and an ermine stole at @entity2 today quick change : left , the @entity0 in wool skirt and warm outerwear in the grounds of @entity37 and right , hours earlier in her silk @entity30 dress , carrying a bespoke @entity42 handbag wearing @entity0 @entity44 's diamonds and pearls in her element : despite the odd grimace , the @entity0 looked overjoyed to be at the horse show , where she would have been able to watch jump competitions and inspect thoroughbreds the @entity25 , held in the grounds of @entity37 , is known to be one of the monarch 's favourite events of the spring / summer calender			1
an occasion for serious equestrians , the @entity0 would have today taken in a jumping competition and a display of part bred and @entity60 horses among other events			0
quite the departure from the pomp and ceremony from earlier in the day where with a 15 minute speech the @entity0 unveiled 20 new @entity67 the coalition will pass into law over the coming year			1
with that out of the way - and the 2.3lb weight of the crown jewels and 15lb state robe changed for her ' civvies ' - the @entity0 must have felt like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders - literally			0
her crystal - encrusted white silk gown - the same one she wore for her jubilee portrait last summer - had been hung safely away			0
instead , the @entity0 wore a sensible blue wool skirt along with her navy coat			0
one is not ( very ) amused : the queen stifles a laugh as her companion makes a joke looks like rain ... the afternoon proved to be mixed , with grey clouds and drizzle taking place of the bright sunshine of earlier in the week it was announced this week that the @entity0 would be scaling back her public duties - primarily cutting back on longhaul flights - a forthcoming @entity96 engagement in @entity97 will be carried out by @entity98 instead of the @entity0			2
indeed , @entity98 attended the @entity99 for the first time in 17 years , and was accompanied for the first time by @entity102 in a clear sign that the heir to the throne is stepping up his royal duties			0
but today , at the ripe old age of 87 , the @entity0 proved she still has more than enough energy to put on an impeccable show - both with the pomp and ceremony of the state occasion , and getting stuck in among the crowds in the field			2
no prizes for guessing which event she enjoyed the most			0
earlier that day ... the @entity0 attended the @entity99 wearing the @entity117 , the @entity118 , a white dress and gloves , and @entity0 @entity44 's pearl earrings and @entity122 it has been announce that prince @entity98 - attending the ceremony for the first time in 17 years , and for the first time with his wife @entity126 of @entity127 - will take on a bigger role as ' co-head ' of the royal family @entity0 wore pearl drop earrings that were given to @entity0 @entity44 by her husband @entity132 the necklace worn by the @entity0 was gifted to @entity0 @entity44 to mark her @entity134 @entity0 , wearing the @entity135 , leaves through the @entity136 of the @entity137 after the state opening of parliament			1

travelled from @entity137 to @entity37 after giving 15 minute speech
*swapped* @entity5 and @entity146 for scarf and raincoat
