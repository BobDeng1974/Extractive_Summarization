@entity0 installs fear in the hearts of millions – the acid - tongued star even turned the original ice queen @entity5 into a meek woman on the current series of celebrity big brother , despite the glamour model insisting there would be fireworks between them			1
but there is one person in this world who can control the notoriously outspoken star – her husband @entity16 – a design manager so quiet and kind that he is known to friends and family as ‘ @entity19 ’			1
in an interview with @entity21 , @entity5 reveals that while she refuses to listen to anyone , even her own children , she bows down to her 50 - year - old husband in every argument			2
the couple married in 2010 and have one child together			1
she says he is the nicest man in the world and her total opposite			1
she said : ‘ he is probably the only person on the planet that can control me , weirdly , because whatever he says is going to be right and there is no escaping that			2
‘ if he was an a * * * hole you could just ignore it but he 's not			2
’ the couple met in 2006 while working at the @entity43 together and first got together in 2007 , shortly after @entity5 had appeared on @entity44 show @entity45			1
at the time , @entity5 was newly - divorced from her first husband @entity47 and @entity48 was still in a seven - year marriage with his first wife @entity28			1
the romance came to light after the couple were caught having sex in a field and the pictures were splashed across the pages of a national tabloid the next day			1
@entity5 and @entity48 pictured having a passionate moment in a field in 2007 @entity5 first became a household name after appearing on the @entity45 in 2007			2
she had a fling with one of the other contestants @entity64 but he dumped her after finding out about her affair with @entity48 unsurprisingly , @entity48 ’s first marriage failed to survive the indiscretion and he split from @entity28 soon after			1
he and @entity5 then started dating and he soon moved into the @entity69 home she shared with her two children from her first marriage , @entity72 and @entity73			2
then in 2008 , their son @entity74 , now six , was born			2
two years later , the pair married in a barn on an episode of celebrity @entity79 , alongside @entity81 , comic @entity82 and ex-popstar @entity83			1
in a recent documentary that saw @entity5 gain and lose several stone in six months , her husband @entity48 was often seen comforting his wife at her lowest ebb , as she tearfully talked to him in a baby voice			1
it was a startling change to the tv personality , who mainly appears on camera delivering nasty put - downs to her opponents with a steely glare			2
@entity5 is now appearing on our screens in celebrity big brother @entity5 has reduced many of her @entity102 housemates to tears on the programme with her sharp tongue @entity106 has often become embroiled in heated arguments with @entity5 in the house and @entity5 admits that even her in - laws ca n’t believe that her husband has chosen to settle down with her			2
in an interview with @entity112 just before she went onto the @entity114 reality show earlier this month , she said : ‘ @entity48 is genuinely the polar opposite of me and everyone says that			1
‘ he 's known as “ @entity19 , ” which really gets on my t * * * , everyone says to me with a look of horror , " what , you 're married to lovely @entity48 ? " ‘ his relatives in @entity126 actually said to me at @entity127 , “ it 's a surprise that you 're married to our @entity48			1
” ‘ he is genuinely the nicest man on the planet			1
not in a wet way though			2
’ @entity48 and @entity5 have one child together , @entity74 , and the couple live with her two children from her previous marriage in a large town house in @entity69			1
@entity5 claims that she is happier that she has ever been in her life and puts the emotions down to her marriage			2
she says @entity48 has shown her a new way to live – one that involves less aggro – and while she might not take it fully on - board , some of it has seeped into her behaviour			0
@entity5 with @entity48 back in 2008 the personality that made her famous often sees her battle against everyone from celebrities on this morning to mums at the school gate , but @entity5 admits that @entity48 is her opposite in every way			1
she said : ‘ he 'll do all of the things that grown - ups tell you to do			0
like for instance , if someone p * * * * * you off on an email - i would just fire one right back or even highlight their own failings			0
‘ @entity48 would do the sensible thing , which is wait two days and then reply in a thought - out and thoroughly sensible manner			0
‘ he 'll take the time to listen to what the kids are saying and respond in a grown up manner			0
‘ he encourages them to have their own points of view and feelings about things and their own responses			0
‘ i do n't have time for any of that			0
i just shout what i think and that 's that			0
‘ but that is @entity48			0
i ca n’t even imagine what he has to say about me , but whatever it is , he would be truthful			0
’ @entity5 with her three children ( left to right : @entity72 , @entity74 and @entity73 ) @entity5 is famous for her bust - ups with celebrities on the @entity190 sofa , including an explosive row with the late @entity192 it is the fact that he is so different from her that @entity5 believes the marriage has worked			0
she said : ‘ i married myself with my first husband , he would agree entirely i 'm sure			1
but that did n't work at all			0
‘ and so with @entity200 have married my polar opposite - he wears soft shoes , he has an earring , he has a skull as a wedding ring and he 's a designer			1
‘ i mean , you could n't be more opposite			1
and that seems to have worked			0
‘ i do n't know how or why , but i think it is because he can tell me when i have gone over the line			0
‘ and obviously he does that on a daily basis			0
’ much like @entity48 , @entity5 ’s first husband @entity213 was married when they first met in 2003			1
@entity213 , a @entity215 in the @entity216 , had been pensioned off because of arthritis and had built a hugely successful management consultancy called @entity219 in @entity220 , @entity221			0
@entity5 joined the firm as a junior client co-ordinator in 2000 and quickly rose through the ranks , being promoted to head of the @entity227 office within 18 months			0
she and @entity213 then started up a relationship and things quickly became serious , leading to him leaving his wife @entity230			1
@entity5 has recently claimed that @entity213 had split from his wife when they started dating , but his wife @entity230 is adamant that is not the case			1
@entity47 pictured with his son @entity235 , from his first marriage to @entity237 , which ended when he started dating @entity5 @entity213 ’s divorce from @entity230 was finalised in may 2003 and that autumn @entity5 announced she was pregnant			0
the couple married in september 2004 , four months after the birth of their daughter @entity72 , now nine years old			1
the couple went on to have a second child together called @entity73 , now seven , in 2006 , but @entity5 has since claimed that by then @entity213 was having an affair with another work colleague and left her soon after the birth			1
the couple have an amicable relationship for the sake of their children , but @entity5 recently acknowledged that the incident made her appreciate her relationship with her now - husband so much more and revealed that although she bounced back from her last marriage , @entity48 having an affair would break her			2
she also told now magazine that she would no longer ever consider having an affair , despite admitting to having them in the past			0
she said ‘ i would never cheat on my husband now			0
‘ there ’s too much at stake			0
when you have a family , you ca n’t think like a single person any more			0
‘ there are too many little hearts to look after			0
i could n’t look at my kids if i ’d let them down like this - it would be too big a price to pay			0
