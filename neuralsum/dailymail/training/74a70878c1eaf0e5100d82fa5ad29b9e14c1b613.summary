using images from archives combined with old weather reports and pioneering colouring and animation software , @entity11 agency @entity12 created what the famous @entity11 landmark would have looked and felt like on a @entity16 weekday evening in may 1961 panning across the statue of @entity19 , you can see the neon @entity21 sign installed in 1954 , and @entity24 's billboard of 1961 this is what the famous landmark looks like today - fewer billboards and more led signs users can see how the billboards used to stretch further into @entity39 , and how there were many smaller advertisements , rather than the few bright lcd screens we 're used to seeing today			1
@entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 are other brands who used to have billboards shown in the charming animation			2
@entity12 opened in @entity11 in february and @entity52 director said : ' at the end of our first week in @entity11 , we walked to @entity3 and sat there , enjoying its marvel			1
' we wondered what it might have looked and felt like before all the big screens ; when the billboards were made of mechanisms and neons			2
after some research and finding incredible archive photographs , we decided to re-create it			0
' @entity65 , director of @entity12 said : ' imagine having gone to see such a film or play , and walking past the entrancing billboards of @entity3			1
it must have been spectacular ' mr @entity65 added : ' strangely for such a famous landmark , there are very few large , original coloured pictures from the 1940s - 1960s			0
@entity12 had to find a number of photographs and layer them on top of each other ' the agency used other photographs to create movement , remastering many from black and white the creative project has an air of @entity86 romance and mystery			2
@entity65 , director of @entity12 said : ' 1961 was the year of @entity88 , @entity89 and breakfast at @entity91			0
' the @entity92 on @entity39 had just started @entity93			2

@entity12 had to find a number of photographs and layer them on top of each other			0
however , as each photograph was from a different year , the @entity3 billboards changed between the photos			2
' he explained to keep it consistent , the agency had to remove people , advertisements and some structures			0
once @entity12 had the photos they created styleboards imagining how the billboards would look and feel when lit up			0
using professional creative design software including @entity121 and 3d camera mapping programs , they were able to create camera movement through @entity3 and past the statue of @entity19			1
their process of turning historical photographs into animated backdrops is the same as that used by @entity133 filmographers , such as in @entity134 - it is more cost effective than creating computer generated imagery ( @entity138 ) from scratch or designing cityscapes .			0

creative design agency in @entity11 created what @entity3 would have looked like in may 1961
