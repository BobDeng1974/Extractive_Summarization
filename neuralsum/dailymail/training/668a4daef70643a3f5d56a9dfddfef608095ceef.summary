footage taken by a fire chief responding to the @entity3 crash has revealed he was not told a 16 - year - old girl was lying injured on the runway - leaving him unable to prevent her from being fatally hit by an emergency vehicle			1
@entity7 , a student from @entity8 , was killed when one of the responding vehicles ran over her after she was covered by fire - retardant foam at the @entity12 on july 6			2
video filmed by a camera on the fire chief 's helmet has now revealed that , although firefighters had seen her on the runway , the message was not communicated to the chief , @entity20			1
it meant that responding vehicles were also not told of her whereabouts , leaving a foam rig to hit her			1
chaos : footage taken from a fire chief 's helmet cam shows foam rigs responding to the scene			1
by this point , a @entity8 schoolgirl had been found on the ground but the chief was apparently not told fatal : it is believed that this foam rig fatally hit @entity39			1
at this point , she was lying somewhere in front of the chief after landing by the plane 's left wing , but she was covered with foam @entity7 's death is under review by investigators from the fire and police departments and the @entity52			1
as part of the probe , the footage from @entity20 's camera is being reviewed			1
it was also seen by a reporter at the @entity59 , who described what the chief saw			0
after the plane apparently landed too slow and hit the sea wall - ripping off the craft 's tail and sending the plane smashing into the runway - @entity7 was ejected and landed by the left wing			1
two @entity71 firefighters who responded to the scene in a truck say they spotted her lying in the fetal position on the runway , and two other firefighters concluded that she was dead - although a coroner has since said that she was still alive at this point			2
chaos : this image shows the chief , @entity20 , as he responded to the crash scene on july 6 response : rigs douse the burning shell with fire - retardant foam , which also covered 16 - year - old @entity7 mix up : she had been seen by other firefighters who had mistakenly concluded she was dead ; it is not believed her whereabouts were communicated to the battalion chief it is not clear why the latter two firefighters thought she was dead , the @entity59 reported			1
it was at this point that @entity20 arrived on the scene and took over control of the scene			2
victim : @entity7 died from blunt force trauma as a result of being hit by a vehicle , the coroner said in the footage , the first foam rig - driven by two men who saw her body - is seen driving away from the scene as @entity20 arrives and looks over the area where @entity7 's foam - covered body lies			1
but according to the footage , the girl 's location was not reported to him ; the battalion chief should have been told of the girl 's whereabouts , whether or not she was alive or dead			1
a second fire rig then arrived on the scene and , after dousing the plane with foam , the driver said she needed to fill up the vehicle again			2
unaware there was a victim beneath the foam , the driver pulled off and hit her			0
in a tragic twist , the rig , labeled rescue 37 , was not fitted with heat - sensing equipment like other firefighting vehicles at the airport			0
the equipment would have detected the body beneath the foam , the @entity59 reported			0
after @entity20 directed the firefighters to leave the scene after hearing everyone was off the plane , another lieutenant approached him and told him there was a body nearby on the footage , @entity20 walks over and looks at the girl 's crushed body			1
' my @entity150 , ' he says , before asking for someone to cover her body with a yellow tarp			0
aerial images of the scene taken by the @entity157 later showed the girl 's body covered with the tarp			2
tire tracks could apparently be seen running up to the body			0
discovery : after a lieutenant spots the girl 's body , @entity20 asks for it to be covered with a tarp investigation : the footage is being used by authorities to probe what went wrong before the girl 's death the @entity59 has not shared the footage online after its source asked it not be uploaded while the investigation continues			1
it is not known exactly how @entity7 ended up on the runway near the left wing , but according to the @entity179 coroner , she was alive for several minutes until she was struck			2
the coroner concluded that she died of blunt force trauma as a result of being hit by a vehicle			0
none of the officers who feature in the footage have responded to a request for comment , while @entity20 said he would need the approval of @entity190 superiors to be able to do so			2
@entity7 's middle school classmate , 16 - year - old @entity191 , also died in the july 6 crash			1
the other victim , 15 - year - old @entity193 , died from her injuries six days after the crash			0
scene : the yellow tarp is right , by the truck			0
tire tracks can apparently be seen near to her body beyond recognition : the charred remains of @entity3 after crash landing in @entity204 @entity191 was among a group of injured passengers who did not get immediate medical help after the crash ; rescuers did not spot her until 14 minutes later			0
the victims were top students who were to spend a few weeks at a @entity213 summer camp in @entity214 , where they planned to practice @entity216 to boost their chances of attending a @entity220 college			0
the crash occurred after the airliner collided with a rocky seawall just short the runway			0
there were 182 survivors taken to hospitals , though most suffered only minor injuries			0
an initial investigation indicated that the pilots failed to realize until too late that the aircraft was dangerously low and flying too slow			0
heartbreak : the fathers of the three crash victims , @entity193 , @entity191 and @entity234 , carry the ashes of their daughters during a memorial in @entity238 , @entity239 province on august 1			0
