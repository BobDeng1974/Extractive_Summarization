@entity0 is hoping a chassis change will speak volumes when it comes to kickstarting his @entity5 title challenge this year			1
@entity6 confirmed @entity0 will drive with a new chassis throughout the @entity9 @entity8 weekend , that begins with practice on friday			1
although the chassis in question is not brand new as it was used in pre-season testing , it is new for a grand prix weekend given the 26 - year - old claimed the old one ' is n't talking to me '			1
on the up ? @entity6 driver @entity0 is hoping a chassis change helps kickstart his season @entity0 currently trails @entity22 ' @entity21 by 46 points after a tough start to the defence of his fourth championship , in particular twice being asked to allow by team - mate @entity27			1
@entity0 concedes he is struggling to adapt to the new car that has been altered dramatically in light of the new regulations that came into force at the start of the year			1
' we all have our own style as to how we like to drive the car , how to set up the car , ' said @entity0			1
' in general i do n't mind when the rear of the car is moving , that it suffers with oversteer			2
' but when the car slides too much , you find yourself correcting more than actually being able to push or get the maximum out of it and it slows you down			2
that has been part of the problem so far			0
' there are lots of reasons behind it			0
it would be nice to have just one problem and one fix , but obviously the car is a lot more complex this year			0
there are a lot more factors than just the car set - up			0
' we 've already improved a lot , but there 's obviously a lot to do , and we are still learning			0
' in @entity0 's mind the reason behind the chassis change is to cover all bases and to ensure there is fundamentally nothing wrong with them			1
man on top : @entity76 's @entity21 leads the drivers ' championship and is ahead of @entity0 by 46 points fine margins : @entity0 insists there is n't an awful lot wrong with his car but it needs minor tweaks ' we concluded after @entity86 , where we were quite a little bit behind , to change the chassis , ' added @entity0			1
' it 's actually not a new chassis , it 's an old one we used in testing in the winter , and we have some experience with it			2
' it 's more a sanity check rather than a real problem with the other chassis			2
it 's just to try everything we can and basically reset and start again			0
' as i say , there is still a lot of work ahead of us as i 'm not as happy as i want to be			0
but it 's a long process , a lot of things have changed we need to be patient			0
