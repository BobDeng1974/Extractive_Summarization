by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 03:55 est , 9 september 2013 crumpets and bubbly chocolate bars might fill some people with joy , but scientists claim that most humans have a primordial fear of clusters of holes			1
everyday objects with many closely - packed holes can be a trigger for people who report suffering from trypophobia , or the fear of holes , which can lead to intensely unpleasant visceral reactions , psychologists claim			1
a study suggests the widespread , predominantly latent phobia is associated with ancient threats such as beehives , poisonous flowers and venomous creatures			1
everyday objects like crumpets with many closely - packed holes can be a trigger for people who report suffering from trypophobia , or the fear of holes , which can lead to intensely unpleasant visceral reactions , scientists claim ‘ @entity37 is the most common phobia you ’ve never heard of , ’ said @entity34 , a psychologist at the @entity35 , who is a self - diagnosed trypophobic			1
in a bid to unravel his own problem , dr @entity34 recently led an investigation into the fear ’s evolutionary underpinnings together with his colleague @entity44 , he believes trypophobia may occur as a result of a specific visual feature also found among various poisonous animals			2
the findings , published in @entity50 , a journal of the @entity52 , suggest ' there may be an ancient evolutionary part of the brain telling people that they are looking at a poisonous animal '			1
@entity58 is widely documented by sufferers on the @entity60 and , in one study , @entity34 and @entity44 found that about 16 per cent of participants reported trypophobic reactions			0
one trypophobia sufferer told dr @entity34 that an animal - a blue - ringed octopus ( pictured ) which is one of the most poisonous animals in the world - had caused him to experience a trypophobic reaction , which informed the direction of the study despite this , there has been little scientific investigation of the phenomenon			2
dr @entity34 and dr @entity44 , both vision scientists , wondered whether there might be a specific visual feature common to trypophobic objects			0
they compared 76 images of trypophobic objects along with 76 images of holes not associated with the phobia			2
after standardising various features of the images , the researchers found that the trypophobic objects had relatively high contrast energy at midrange spatial frequencies in comparison to the control images , which is to say they have a unique visual quality to them			0

based on their observations , the researchers believe the phobia could have an evolutionary basis and humans have learned to fear dangerous animals with these special markings - and even perhaps honeycomb which can lead to painful bee stings - to survive the researchers analysed images of numerous poisonous animals , including the octopus , deathstalker scorpion and king cobra snake to discover that they tend to have ' high contrast at midrange spacial frequencies - the distribution of circles that triggers the trypophobic reaction			1

dr @entity34 said : ' we think that everyone has trypophobic tendencies even though they may not be aware of it			0
' we found that people who do n't have the phobia still rate trypophobic images as less comfortable to look at than other images			0
' the pair are now investigating whether manipulating the spectral characteristics of images of everyday objects , like watches , leads people to prefer one object over another			0
they believe these experiments will shed light on just how ingrained trypophobic tendencies might be			0
