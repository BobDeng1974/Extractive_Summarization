@entity148 of @entity149 and surveillance director @entity150 told @entity69 dr @entity8 was tapping into people 's ' fear factor '			1
' when we 've got no disease to see , it 's very easy to look at something like autism - unfortunately it 's something we still do n't understand - and start to suggest it has something to do with being vaccinated			0
you can understand why people would believe that , ' he said			0
' but there are hundreds of studies that disprove that			0
' professor @entity167 added there was no scientific evidence homeopathic vaccinations protected people against infectious diseases			0
