by @entity0 published : 17:40 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 01:54 est , 20 june 2012 a mall 's marketing firm has been forced to take down a lewd sign outside of a @entity5 shopping centre after a public outcry			1
the sign , which was at @entity2 in @entity7 , read : ‘ we apologise for the whistling construction workers , but man you look good ! so will we soon , please pardon our dust , dirt and other assorted inconveniences			1
’ it was accompanied by a hand - drawn leggy brunette in a figure - conscious orange shirt , curve - hugging skirt , and heeled black boots			2
outrage : more than 2,000 people signed a petition demanding this sign outside of a @entity7 , @entity5 mall be removed pardon our dust : the sign was outside @entity26 mall covering a construction site the sign caused considerable outrage among shoppers , who said it was demeaning and sexist			1
one person said she signed the petition on @entity33 because it painted men and women both in a singularly stereotypical light			1
‘ thanks for assuming that all women are sex objects and all men ( particularly blue - collar and / or minority men ) are uncontrollable sex maniacs			0
this is your @entity44 , ’ she wrote			0
another wrote : ‘ not a joke , not a compliment			0
women do not exist as eye candy			0
’ @entity51 wrote the petition demanding the sign be removed from the mall ’s exterior			1
within 24 hours after the petition was posted , the mall ’s vp of @entity58 , @entity59 , agreed to have the sign removed			1
she did not immediately respond to @entity61 's request for comment			2
the petition garnered more than 2,000 signatures , with many writing in their disgust at the sign 's tactlessness			1
according to @entity69 , the sign covered a construction site run by @entity71			1
while ‘ pardon our dust ’ signs during construction and renovation are commonplace , this tongue - in - cheek sign clearly did not go over well with shoppers at the @entity5 mall			1
but this is n’t the first case of advertisements going too far with jokes about women			0
under fire : @entity85 tweeted the controversial ad which appeared to make a joke about a woman being raped in march , @entity85 briefly posted an advert implying date rape , with a smiling young man pulling a terrified woman in close			2
the caption read : ' unlike some people , @entity85 always goes down smoothly			2
' the advertisement , which was posted on the company ’s @entity98 and @entity99 accounts , was pulled an hour later			0
@entity85 later tweeted an apology , which read : ‘ we apologise to any of our fans who were offended by our recent tweet			2
we continue to be an advocate of safe and responsible drinking			0
’ an additional apology was sent to @entity110 writer @entity108 , which read in part : ‘ ‘ the post is absolutely inconsistent with our values and beliefs and in addition to removing the offensive post we are committed to making sure that something like this does n’t happen again			0
‘ as an expression of our deep disappointment and regret , we are making a charitable donation to a women ’s support cause			0
we deeply apologize to our fans & followers			0

sign reads : ' we apologise for the whistling construction workers , but man you look good ! '
after more than 2,000 people signed petition , @entity132 's vp of @entity58 said it will be removed
