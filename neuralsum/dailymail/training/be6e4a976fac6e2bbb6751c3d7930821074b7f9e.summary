for two clubs whose rivalry was enhanced by a ship canal , rarely have @entity4 and @entity5 entered a derby contest with defences equally distant from what you might call watertight			1
pub standard , was @entity12 ’s acerbic take – the @entity13 against the @entity14			1
but the undeniable fact is that those selected to guard goals at either end on sunday will not measure up to figures who have come before			0
@entity4 have struggled at the back this season with @entity15 yet to find a settled pairing @entity5 long for a defender of @entity29 's ( centre ) stature given their struggles this season @entity32 ( left ) helped @entity5 win two @entity34 titles and an @entity35 @entity36 was another towering force in the @entity5 defence which is now full of holes @entity40 was the most expensive @entity41 player when he joined @entity4 in 2002 for £ 30m neither team possesses a centre - back with the leadership of @entity45 or @entity32 , the collectedness of @entity40 or @entity29 , the physicality of @entity48 or @entity49			1
that is not to say these current defences are write - offs			0
certain players have shown glimpses to impress			0
but right now , the shadow of predecessors is cast large			0
he exuded calm and instilled belief across the back , captaining a @entity4 team of formidable characters as the @entity62 came to rest at @entity63			1
there was also that famous late brace against @entity66 , showing as much about his guts as aerial prowess			0
then aged 35 , @entity45 helped nurture the likes of @entity12 during his second double season			1
in similar mode – @entity32 led @entity5 on their ascendancy in the early 60s			1
bought by @entity74 and given the armband , he was a substantial presence			0
‘ the man is a mountain , go into the dressing room and walk around him , ’ @entity74 told journalists on his signing			0
@entity32 got @entity5 promoted from the @entity82 and then won two @entity34 titles and an @entity35			1
@entity84 has been a big loss to @entity5 since hanging up his boots last year @entity5 defender @entity87 throws himself into a tackle against @entity90 's @entity89 @entity4 have missed the presence of @entity48 since he left for @entity92 over the summer lacking for each of @entity4 and @entity5 , is a player at the heart of defence who can be turned to for inspiration when the turf begins to shake			1
neither is there a defender who can be trusted to always remain cool under pressure			0
@entity40 had that skill , a composure to perform that sharp turn to find space when confronted with an onrushing attacker , rather than kick the ball into touch			1
he left @entity4 with a @entity109 and six @entity62 titles in his baggage			2
@entity29 won three @entity113 cups and eight @entity34 crowns and was imperative to @entity5 ’s sustained period of dominance			1
eschewing the option to boot the ball forwards , he would be more inclined to dribble out from the back , hence his years on @entity120 bemoaning diabolical defending			2
defences work on unity , of course			0
@entity45 formed a redoubtable understanding with @entity126 that enhanced both of their games , @entity40 ’s silk was allied by @entity48 ’s steel			1
@entity29 had @entity131 , then @entity132 as sidekick – finding hand and glove twice is fortunate but more testament to the players ’ talents			2
under @entity15 , obtaining a settled defence is more likely than locating the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow – and that uncertainty is debilitating			0
@entity143 made close to 200 appearances for @entity4 , winning the @entity35 in 1985 @entity126 ( right ) and @entity45 formed a brilliant partnership at the heart of the @entity4 defence @entity15 could do with a player like countryman @entity149 who was a mainstay in the @entity4 defence @entity150 ( right ) sits fourth on the @entity4 all - time appearances list @entity152 has shown promise but was hooked before half - time at @entity155 having endured a torrid match			1
@entity157 needs time to develop			0
@entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 are injured too frequently to build up a head of steam – and @entity163 simply does not look a centre - back			2
@entity16 would have hoped @entity165 would form a solid union with @entity167 , but each have gone backwards from last season			2
@entity170 has got some games but is prone to mistakes , and we are still waiting to see why @entity174 cost £ 18million			0
how @entity15 would long for countryman @entity149 in his pomp – a courageous carrier of the ball and man of granite stature			2
how @entity16 would call up in a flash a prime - age @entity84 – a defender of nous and bravery			0
then there is @entity143 and @entity150 , @entity87 and @entity36 ; great defenders each			1
it is a pity we can not yet say the same about those taking the pitch this weekend			0
but that is the measure at these clubs			2
@entity152 ( left ) was replaced before half time as @entity4 struggled to a win over @entity155 @entity165 ( centre ) and @entity167 ( right ) have yet to form a steady partnership in defence			1

@entity4 and @entity5 have struggled at the back this season
@entity12 *labelled* their clash as ' the @entity13 vs the @entity14 '
both clubs are lacking defenders of the stature they are both used to
@entity4 have called on @entity40 , @entity45 and @entity143
@entity32 , @entity29 and @entity49 played at the back for @entity5
