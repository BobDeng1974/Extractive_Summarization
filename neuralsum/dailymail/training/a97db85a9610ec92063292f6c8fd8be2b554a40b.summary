the internet is awash with shaky smartphone footage , but a group of filmmakers has proved that it 's possible to use them to make entire movies fit for the big screen			2
uneasy lies the mind is the first narrative feature length movie to be shot entirely on the @entity11			1
one issue the makers had to overcome while filming the 88 - minute movie was the fact that phones do n't work very well in cold temperatures and the shoot was in @entity20 's frigid @entity19 in @entity21			1
but it turned out that keeping it under their armpits helped			2
a fully charged @entity11 will die in less than two minutes when exposed to these frigid cold temperatures			1
‘ in between takes the filmmakers would have to place the camera underneath their armpits in order to keep it warm			2
@entity46 takes were lost because the camera would continuously die mid-shot			2
’ the makers say that while there have been numerous ' found footage ' @entity11 movies - self - reflexive movies in which the actors hold and talk directly to the @entity11 - a couple of documentaries and numerous short films , their movie is the first traditional narrative feature shot entirely on the @entity11			1
the movie ’s plot revolves around @entity62 , a freshly minted movie star			2
he has it all : wealth , fame and a beautiful expecting wife			2
budget production : the film cost just $ 10,000 to make disturbing : shot in @entity21 , uneasy lies the mind tells the story of a man 's sanity slowly unravelling tech talk : the filmmakers used an @entity11 fitted with a lens adaptor called the @entity77 girl , interrupted : many of the shots had to be redone because the @entity11 's battery died but when the couple ’s two best friends join them at their new mountain mansion for @entity62 ’s birthday , envy , secrets and paranoia play out behind a barren winter landscape			1
soon the two couples grow increasingly antagonistic and turn to alcohol and drugs to bury thepast			0
when an old friend shows up unexpectedly , @entity62 must scramble to protect his new life			0
theharder he fights to hold it all together , the faster he descends into a cavernous mental abyss			0
as the night grows late , @entity62 is forced to decipher reality from a twisting rabbit hole of truth andillusion			0
the film , shot on a budget of just $ 10,000 ( £ 6,000 ) by @entity103 , is told from the perspective of a man who has been robbed and violently hit over the head			1
as he lays dying in the middle of an open field , the story unfolds through his fragmented and traumatized memories			0
these memories are far from crisp and clean , so the visuals in the story needed to reflect this , the makers said			0
horror : uneasy lies the mind has some disturbing scenes they originally wanted to shoot on 16mm film			1
without the budget for it , they decided to go on a quest to replicate a 16mm film aesthetic with modern day camera technology			1
after playing around with the @entity11 , and a lens adaptor called the @entity77 , they fell in love with the look and knew right away that this was the aesthetic in which to tell the story			1
the @entity37 added : ' in the middle of the @entity133 is a glass focusing screen with a patterned texture , almost like a finger print			0
hair , dirt , and oil from my hands would always get stuck on these focusing screens			0
' i completely welcomed these textured imperfections and chose not to clean or replace any of the dirty parts			0
at times i would even add dust and dirt			0
' while shooting i used the @entity150 app. it ’s incredibly powerful and allows you to control the frame rate , compression , and numerous other settings			0
' the movie is being shown at the @entity156 in @entity157 on march 8 and the following day at the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 .			1
