detectives in the great @entity2 camera heist have a prime lead in the their investigation - an image of a man caught by the cctv camera in the act of removing it from a photographic studio this week			1
too busy stealing the camera to disguise his face - or to even remove the cigarette in his mouth - the man is dressed in a light - coloured cap and dark hoodie and captured with his arms stretched out to the camera he is stealing			1
the ultimate caught in the act photograph - which could be termed a ' shelfie ' because with the camera 's aid he is shelfing himself , or giving himself up - was taken by the camera inside @entity25 in @entity26 , 80km south of @entity27 , from where two cameras were stolen			1
some mothers do ' ave ' em : @entity2 thief , cigarette in mouth , captured in the act of stealing a @entity2 camera by the very camera he is pulling off the wall of a photography studio in @entity26 , south of @entity27 it is being widely shared on @entity42 along with witty remarks about the thief , who was also filmed wheeling up his bicycle to the camera to commit the burglary			1
' @entity48 , going to steal a camera better slip the hoodie on so no one sees me ...			0
stares right on into the camera for a close up shot ...			0
. some mothers do have them , ' wrote @entity57 after officers from @entity59 posted the image			2
' please find him , arrest him and take away his ability to reproduce , ' posted @entity63			0
and from @entity64 : ' but first , let me take a selfie ! ' the ultimate ' shelfie ' : social media posters on @entity42 have been quick to take the mickey out of the apparently oblivious thief who has ' shelfed ' himself ( dobbed himself in ) with the aid of the camera he is stealing @entity26 detectives know exactly what time the robbery took place , at 4.36am and five seconds last sunday , recorded and time stamped on the footage			1
' this video must be sent to some form of ' world 's dumbest criminals ' tv show , ' wrote @entity84 , whereas @entity85 said ' he should have just worn a name tag			1
no mistaking that head ' , according to @entity89 , who owns the photography studio where the robbery took place , the @entity2 footage shows the thief may have thought he had got away scot free because @entity2 footage just cuts out when he manages to disconnect the camera from the wall			2
mr @entity89 said the cameras were worth just $ 90 each , @entity97 reports			0
police say the @entity42 post is proving popular and anyone with information about the man 's identity should contact @entity105 on 1800333000			1
not everyone is sure of the man 's guilt			2
@entity109 posted on the @entity110 , ' he may not have stolen [ it ]			0
may have just been tampering with it minutes before someone else stole it			0
i 'm sure there is a lawyer out there somewhere who would argue that lesser charge			0
not that i 'm saying he is guilty of anything other than stupidity ' @entity123 wrote , ' right , @entity109 ! he could been cleaning a spot or using it to see his reflection ! ' .			0
