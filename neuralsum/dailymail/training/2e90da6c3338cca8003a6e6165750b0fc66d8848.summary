by @entity0 last updated at 6:00 pm on 18th november 2011 the wife of former @entity3 president @entity2 has told of the huge price she paid for her husband 's struggle against communism			1
she revealed her loneliness and jealousy as her husband led his shipyard workers in a revolt which eventually toppled the country 's authoritarian regime			1
he would go on to win a @entity16 peace prize , but 62 - year - old @entity17 felt neglected as she raised their eight children			1
couple : @entity21 and her husband @entity22 attend a ceremony in 2008 marking 25 years since he was awarded the @entity16 peace prize now in a candid 550 - page autobiography , @entity25 , which is out next week , she.expresses hurt that she was excluded from her husband 's strategic decisions that gave rise to @entity30			1
some of the revelations from the book shatter the long - held view of a happy and deeply united former president and first lady - not least because of their shared @entity37 faith			1
' there was no formal divorce , but there were two separate worlds in our family , ' @entity2 writes in a copy of the book obtained by @entity46			1
she says family life was generally peaceful in the early years of their 42 - year marriage			1
but things took a turn for the worse when her husband rose to prominence during historic strikes in august 1980 , when workers demanded greater freedoms			1
the way they were : @entity21 and @entity2 say goodbye to each other as she leaves the country to pick up his @entity16 peace prize in @entity62 in 1983 victory : solidarity leader @entity2 is hailed by workers at the @entity65 after it was announced he had won the @entity16 prize ' in august everything was smashed , ' she writes			1
' our nest was torn apart			1
' it was then that @entity2 , who had been fired from his job as a shipyard electrician for his political agitation , jumped over the yard 's fence to lead a wage strike against the regime			1
@entity21 recalls how , on aug. 14 , 1980 , her husband left home promising to register the birth of their sixth child , two - week - old @entity82 , at the city hall in @entity65			1
instead he headed straight to the shipyard			1
hours later she learned that her husband had become the strike 's leader			2
' when @entity30 was born , not immediately , but in a short time , the father and the husband was gone , ' she writes			2
' and later , in the 1980s , with that bloody politics , he was less and less involved at home , with the children , with me , with the family			1
' the family 's loss was @entity3 's gain			2
under @entity2 , @entity30 showed the communist authorities that they were no longer welcome , and in 1989 , having weathered a martial law crackdown and massive arrests , it peacefully ushered in democracy and a free market economy			2
@entity2 became @entity3 's first popularly elected president , serving from 1990 - 95			2
@entity21 acknowledges that those years of hardship also brought rewards			2
when word spread in august 1980 that the wife of the national hero was home alone with six children , strangers came offering food , money and other help			1
' the amount of kindness that came my way at the time could not be compared to anything at any other time in my life , ' she says			2
audience : pope @entity126 greets @entity2 at the @entity127 in @entity128 in 2000 leaders : former @entity3 president @entity2 and former @entity132 leader @entity131 attending the 10th world summit of @entity134 in @entity135 in 2009 but the small family apartment also became the pilgrimage site for hordes of @entity30 activists , international journalists and people seeking counsel			2
@entity21 , still nursing @entity143 and with five other children , felt obliged to cater to them , but at some point broke down under the stress			1
' one day , in the presence of all these people , i started yelling at my husband			2
my husband rose and left , without one word			2
all the others left with him , ' @entity21 remembers			2
a few hours later @entity2 returned with a decision : ' if you wish , we will put up a sign on the front door : typhoid fever			0
' peace returned to the home			0
@entity21 faced more sadness in january 1982 , when she gave birth to their seventh child , @entity165 , while @entity2 was imprisoned during martial law			0
the baby 's christening drew crowds , but @entity2 's absence was painfully felt by his wife			1
@entity173 also came into play			0
she complains that her husband used the same term of affection - ' little frog ' - with other women , just as with her			0
she is also rueful that despite all of @entity3 's sacrifices , and its leading role in triggering change in the revolutionary year of 1989 , many people today think mostly of the fall of the @entity185 as the watershed moment			0
' unfortunately , it is not the flower - decorated @entity188 of the @entity65 in 1980 , but the crumbling @entity185 in 1989 that has become the symbol of the freedom and unity of @entity193 , ' she writes			0
@entity21 was briefly in the international spotlight on dec. 10 , 1983 , when she traveled to @entity62 to receive the @entity16 peace prize on her husband 's behalf			0
he was recognised for his fight against communism but feared that if he left the country , the communist authorities would n't let him back in			0
she complains that he essentially ordered her to go without first asking her how she felt about doing so			1
now she is glad she went			0
' it was a lesson in life for me , a wonderful lesson			0
i shed my complexes , my fear that i am not capable of doing something , that i can not cope , ' she says			0
' i am very grateful to my husband for that			0
' guests : the former @entity3 presidents , @entity2 and @entity213 watch from the balcony during the first session of the new @entity3 @entity216 in @entity217 this year @entity2 has defended himself against some of her accusations by arguing that he could not consult with her during the @entity30 years because the secret police had bugged their home			0
he also felt home life had to be sacrificed for a higher calling			1
' i needed to have my hands free for the country , ' he said in an interview this week in the daily newspaper @entity229			0
@entity21 , born @entity230 in 1949 in @entity231 , a hamlet in central @entity3 , was the second of nine children of poor farmers			1
from her earliest years she dreamed of seeing more of the world and in 1968 moved to @entity65 , where she found work as a florist			0
@entity2 walked into her shop one day that same year			0
though she says she was n't particularly impressed with him at first , he courted her persistently and they were married a year later			0
after @entity2 served his single term as president , he has kept busy traveling the world giving lectures on his unique role in @entity3 's history , though they still live together in a house in @entity65 and celebrate his birthday together every year with a crowd of visitors			0
he now devotes a lot of time to his love of computers			0
' some eight or 10 years ago ... my husband traded me in for a computer , which he sometimes admits himself , ' @entity21 writes			0
@entity2 insists that he always loved his wife , though he admits ' it is not the same as it was ' early on			0
@entity21 dedicated the book to her children .			1
