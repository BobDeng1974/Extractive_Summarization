@entity0 refused yesterday to rule out a deal with @entity2 after next year ’s general election , saying he would n’t speculate on what would happen if the @entity5 fail to win a majority again			1
the prime minister dodged a question on whether he might turn to @entity9 , whose party hopes to win a number of @entity13 seats , to help prop up a minority @entity5 administration			1
but there are growing fears among senior civil servants that the general election could produce a dead heat between the main parties – with only a ‘ rainbow ’ coalition made up of several parties able to govern			1
that would mean neither main party could form a coalition capable of commanding an absolute @entity13 majority of 326 with the @entity35 alone			2
they would also have to try to reach a deal with either the @entity43 - on course to steal at least a dozen @entity33 seats in @entity45 , which would give them a total approaching 20 - @entity48 ’s @entity47 , or @entity2 and the @entity49 , which could each pick up two or three seats			1
such a government would be inherently unstable and dependent on personal relationships between several different party leaders			0
asked if he would do a deal with mr @entity9 in order to stay in power , if @entity2 does win its first seats at a general election , the prime minister told @entity60 : ‘ the next election is absolutely wide open , and it could easily result , if people vote the right way , in a @entity5 - only government			1
that ’s what i ’m campaigning for and nothing ’s going to distract me between now and then			0
‘ until that election is over , you wo n’t get me speculating on what would happen if i fall short			2
‘ people know with me that i will always try and do the right thing for @entity73			0
at the last election , we did n’t have an overall majority , we fell short , and i thought the right thing to do was to give @entity73 strong and stable government to get the deficit down , turn the economy round , get the country back to work			2
listen to the full interview on @entity60 here			0
is this the face of @entity2 's second mp ? @entity85 is standing in the by - election in @entity27 and @entity87 ‘ i believe at the next election i ’ve got a very strong case to say you ’ve seen what we ’ve done in coalition , having to make some compromises , not being able to go ahead with all the things we wanted to do , now give us the chance to really deliver for the country , including on issues like immigration			1
’ aides insisted mr @entity0 had not been signalling any shift in his thinking , and would have given the same answer about coalition or a looser arrangement with any other political party , including the @entity35			0
‘ he gave his standard response , which is that he is going all out for a @entity5 majority and he is not going to speculate about what happens in any other scenario , ’ said one			2
‘ you could equally say he did n’t rule out an alliance with any other party			0
’ mr @entity9 has suggested he might support the @entity29 in the event of a hung @entity116 under a so - called ‘ confidence and supply arrangement ’ , which means a minor party agreeing to support budgets and other key measures but stopping short of a full coalition			0
asked the day after @entity2 ’s byelection victory in @entity123 if he was prepared to join a full coalition , mr @entity9 said : ‘ i do n’t honestly think that ’s what has to be done , just because the @entity35 did that			2
you can support a minority government by saying on motions of confidence or on key bills you would give them support			0
there are lots of ways of doing this			0
’ a small number of @entity5 mps have called for local pacts with @entity2 in order to prevent the @entity145 vote from being split next year , something ruled out by both @entity5 and @entity2 hqs			1
senior figures in @entity2 have privately admitted they would rather see @entity147 in power after the election because they believe an ‘ out ’ vote in an @entity152 referendum is more likely under him than mr @entity0 , who has promised to renegotiate looser ties with @entity154 .			1

pollsters say conservatives and @entity33 could end with about 284 seats each
@entity43 are on course to steal at least a dozen @entity33 seats in @entity45
