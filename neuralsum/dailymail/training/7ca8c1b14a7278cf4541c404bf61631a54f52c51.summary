a half - century - old section of a @entity2 air force base in @entity3 has been transformed into a holding and processing center for thousands of children illegally crossing the border from @entity8 and @entity9 without adults			1
leaked photos from the base , which were obtained by the @entity14 news blog show hundreds of children holed up in crowded concrete rooms , many of them sleeping on the bare floor without blankets or pillows			0
among those children are @entity23 , 12 , who came from @entity24 to the @entity2 and now rests on a bunk at @entity26 in @entity27 under a hand - drawn flag of his native country and a message cheering the @entity24 squad in the upcoming soccer @entity33			1
overflowing : the shelter at @entity26 in @entity3 can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids , forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to @entity41 for processing hundreds of immigrants believed to be in the country illegally from @entity8 and @entity45 being held in crowded concrete rooms similar to a jail cell many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger @entity26 has become a temporary shelter for youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone @entity9 has been left astounded by the shocking conditions these children have been kept in - conditions so dire that border control agents fear the spread of disease about 850 that were being housed at the facility have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor @entity23 is one of the 60,000 ' unaccompanied minors ' - children under 18 - that the @entity66 administration estimates will enter the @entity2 illegally this year			1
it projects that number to grow to nearly 130,000 next year , creating what the @entity69 describes as an ' urgent humanitarian situation '			1
nearly 1,000 of the minors at a time are being sheltered at a facility built about 50 years ago to house new recruits for basic training			0
the boys and girls will pass along corridors with faded @entity81 pictures and new signs written in @entity83 that point the way to the dining hall and bathrooms			0
since the facility opened three weeks ago , 1,820 children have passed through the center			0
about 850 have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor , said @entity2 @entity93 spokesman @entity92			2
president @entity66 said the sharp influx of unaccompanied children from @entity24 , @entity96 and @entity97 was an ' urgent humanitarian situation ' more than 33,000 minors were apprehended in the @entity101 of @entity3 since october last year , it has been reported at the base , children are provided with three hot meals and two snacks a day			1
they can call home twice a week			0
they have access to mental health clinicians and on - site medical care the minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in @entity45 and other parts of @entity8 such as @entity24 , @entity96 and @entity97 the person who takes the child , @entity92 says , has to agree to bring the child to an immigration hearing			1
the minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in @entity45 and other parts of @entity8 such as @entity24 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
they are sometimes seeking to reunite with a parent who is already in the @entity2 , also without documentation			2
another facility for minors will open at @entity129 in @entity130 that will hold a maximum of 600 children			0
at @entity26 , the children between the ages of 12 and 17 are handed several sheets and towels when they arrive and checked for lice and scabies			2
@entity139 blame president @entity66 for the situation , pointing to his 2012 policy that sent a message of hope to kids yearning to stay in the @entity2 photos leaked thursday from a @entity2 @entity150 facility in the @entity101 show overflowing holding facilities of immigrants , many of whom are children over 400 children a day are coming and as many as 60,000 will cross the @entity45 border illegally this year they then undergo physical and mental health evaluations , and are assigned a metal bunk from among the rows that line the walls of large barracks - style rooms			1
there is little need for storage because , as social workers put it , few of these children arrived with anything other than the clothes they wore on their journey north			0
the administration estimates it costs taxpayers $ 252 per child per day			0
' the reasons , as we understand them , that contribute to this dramatic increase have to do with economic conditions in those countries , sustained violence in these countries , and the desire of these children to be reunited with family members in the @entity2 , ' @entity186 , the @entity185 said .			2

the @entity191 @entity26 has become a temporary shelter for children and youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone
the government *expects* as many as 60,000 child immigrants to illegally enter the @entity2 alone this year
measures a *tenfold* jump in just three years
