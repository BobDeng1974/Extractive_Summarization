by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:02 est , 3 november 2012 updated : 06:10 est , 3 november 2012 the @entity2 considered moving its @entity4 consulate a mile away to a @entity6 base a month before the deadly attack by militants linked to @entity9 which killed ambassador @entity10 and three			1
a classified cable also reveals the @entity2 mission drafted a contingency plan to suspend its operation as security in the @entity18 city deteriorated amid increasing violence			1
the secret cable , sent to secretary of state @entity22 's office , reflected officials ' concerns that the @entity18 militia protecting the consulate could have been infiltrated by extremists			1
the message , seen by @entity29 , reported the discussions from an august 15 emergency meeting , including the detail that members of the @entity18 february 17 @entity34 were hesitant to share information with the @entity2			2
burning issue : mr @entity10 and three other @entity2 were killed in a six - hour , commando - style attack on the @entity39 in @entity4 on september 11 , for which @entity9 in @entity40 and @entity42 militia @entity41 were implicated consulate staff believed they were under surveillance in the early hours of september 11 when a member of the police unit guarding the compound was found taken photographs of the inside of the mission , according to documents recovered from the site by @entity54			1
days after the attack , an intelligence source told @entity29 : ' one thing for sure is that the 17 @entity34 was nowhere to be found and the @entity2 were left on their own in the assault			0
' moving the consulate to the @entity6 annex might not have saved the four @entity2 who died in the september 11 strike			1
two of the four dead were killed at the site when it came under fire in the six - hour , commando - style attack on the @entity69 in the @entity18 city , for which @entity9 and @entity42 militia @entity41 have been blamed			1
the uncovering of the cable 's contents come a day after intelligent chiefs admitted the @entity6 was operating a covert mission in the @entity2 consulate in @entity18 when it came under attack			1
the @entity6 made the revelation as it laid bare the heroic rescue by a handful of its agents in which they fought off wave after wave of mortar and rocket attacks with just their handguns as they sought to infiltrate the compound and shepherd its @entity2 staff to safety			2
a timeline , released by the agency , has blown open the dramatic sequence of events , revealing for the first time that of the 30 @entity2 officials evacuated from the country following the deadly attack , just seven worked for the @entity98			1
killed : ambassador @entity10 ( left ) died of smoke inhalation , while agent @entity100 ( right ) died in a desperate battle with insurgents heroic : former @entity103 ( left ) and @entity104 ( right ) were killed in a mortar attack the rest were part of a crack team of intelligence and security experts on a secret mission aimed at counterterrorism and securing heavy weapons held by the embattled regime			1
they had been operating out of a building known as ' the annex ' , around a mile away from the consulate in central @entity4			1
intelligence officials told how when the annex received a call about the assault , about a half dozen members of a @entity6 security team tried to get heavy weapons and other assistance from the @entity18			1
but with time running out , the team went ahead with the rescue attempt armed only with their standard - issue small arms			0
a fierce firefight ensued and the team managed to get into the consulate and shepherd its occupants back to the annex under constant attack from machine gun fire and rocket - propelled grenades			2
' the security officers in particular were genuine heroes , ' an official said			0
' they quickly tried to rally additional local support and heavier weapons , and when that could not be accomplished within minutes , they still moved in and put their own lives on the line to save their comrades			0
' at every level in the chain of command , from the senior officers in @entity18 to the most senior officials in @entity150 , everyone was fully engaged in trying to provide whatever help they could			0
' the @entity6 revelations come after @entity155 's administration came under sharp attack over its handling of the incident amid claims @entity150 told officers on the ground to ' stand down ' before the rescue took place			0
heroic : @entity6 agents engaged in a fierce firefight with heavily - armed insurgents at the consulate before shepherding its occupants to safety under constant attack from machine gun fire and rocket - propelled grenades ' there was no second - guessing those decisions being made on the ground , by people at every @entity2 organization that could play a role in assisting those in danger , ' the official added			1
' there were no orders to anybody to stand down in providing support			0
' in the first days after the attack , various administration officials linked the @entity4 incident to the simultaneous protests around the @entity189 world over an @entity2 - made film that ridiculed @entity189 's @entity191			1
only later did they publicly attribute it to militants , possibly linked to @entity9 , and acknowledged it was distinct from the film protests			0
the changing explanations have led to suspicions that the administration did n't want to acknowledge a terror attack on @entity2 personnel so close to the november 6 election , a charge president @entity155 has strongly denied			0
inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours according to the timeline , around 9.40pm @entity4 time , officials at the @entity6 's relatively fortified and well - defended base in @entity4 got a call from @entity98 officials at the @entity2 diplomatic mission about a mile away that the less - fortified public mission complex had come under attack from a group of militants			1
other official sources said that the initial wave of attacks on the diplomatic mission involved setting fires using diesel fuel			0
9.40pm - @entity6 officials in ' @entity230 ' get a distress call from the consulate saying they are under attack			2
10.05pm - armed only with handguns , team of about six @entity6 security officers leave their base for the public diplomatic mission compound			2
10.30pm - with bullets whistling overhead , the @entity6 team move into the compound after unsuccessfully trying to get heavy weapons and help from local @entity18 allies			1
11.10pm - a @entity245 drone , which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away , arrived in @entity4 to help officials on the ground gather information			2
11.30pm - @entity2 personnel who had been working or staying at the mission all accounted for , except for @entity10			2
11.40pm - driving back to the secure base , the evacuees come under further fire			0
12am - the installation itself comes under fire from small arms and rocket - propelled grenades			0
12am - a @entity6 security team based in @entity261 , which included two @entity2 military officers , lands at @entity4 airport and begins plotting how to locate the missing ambassador			1
1am - the patchy attacks on the base begin to die down after 90 minutes of fierce fighting			0
4am - the reinforcements from @entity261 take a convoy of vehicles to the @entity6 base to prepare for evacuation			2
4.30am - a fresh round of mortar attacks is launched on the base , killing two @entity2 security officers			0
5.30 - a heavily armed @entity18 military unit arrive at the @entity6 base to help evacuate the compound of @entity2 personnel to the @entity4 airport			1
from 6am - roughly 30 @entity2 , as well as the bodies of @entity10 and the other three @entity2 killed during the attacks , were loaded on planes and flown out of the city , several @entity2 officials said			1
the dense smoke created by the fuel both made it hard for people at the compound to breathe and to organise a response to the attack			0
about 25 minutes after the initial report came into the @entity6 base , a team of about six agency security officers left their base for the public diplomatic mission compound			2
over the succeeding 25 minutes , the @entity6 team approached the compound , and tried , apparently unsuccessfully , to get local @entity18 allies to bring them a supply of heavier weapons , and eventually moved into the burning diplomatic compound , the intelligence official said			1
at around 11.10pm , a @entity245 drone , which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away , arrived in @entity4 to help officials on the ground gather information			0
by 11.30 , @entity2 personnel who had been working or staying at the mission had been rounded up except for @entity10 , who was missing , the intelligence official said			0
when they tried to drive out of the diplomatic compound to return to the @entity6 base , however , the convoy carrying @entity2 evacuees came under fire			1
once they got back to the @entity6 base , that installation itself came under fire from what the intelligence official described as small arms and rocket - propelled grenades			2
these patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes , the intelligence official said			0
around the same time , a @entity6 security team based in @entity261 , which included two @entity2 military officers , landed at @entity327			0
upon its arrival , however , the team spent some time trying both to arrange local transport and to locate the missing ambassador @entity10			2
after some time trying to solve these problems , the security team that had flown in from @entity261 eventually arranged for an armed local escort and extra transportation , but decided not to go the hospital where they believed @entity10 had been taken			0
in part this was because they had reason to believe @entity10 was likely dead , and because security at the hospital was believed , at best , to be ' uncertain , ' the intelligence official said			0
not long before dawn , the reinforcements from @entity261 managed to take themselves and a convoy of vehicles to the @entity6 base to prepare for an anticipated evacuation			0
however , just after they arrived at the @entity6 base , the official said , a new round of attacks on that facility was launched , this time with mortars			2
although the mortar attacks lasted only 11 minutes , two @entity2 security officers were killed by a direct hit from one of the shells , the intelligence official said			0
finally , a bit less than an hour later , a heavily armed @entity18 military unit arrived at the @entity6 base to help evacuate the compound of @entity2 personnel to the @entity4 airport , the official added			1
over the next few hours , roughly 30 @entity2 , as well as the bodies of @entity10 and the other three @entity2 killed during the attacks , were loaded on planes and flown out of the city , several @entity2 officials said .			1
