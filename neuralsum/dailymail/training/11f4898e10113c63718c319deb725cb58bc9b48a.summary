get a whiff of this : a @entity3 research , art and design centre have created a gizmo , similar to a mobile phone , that enables the user to send up to 320 different smells to other devices of its kind			1
@entity14 's cylindrical @entity13 , invented by @entity15 and @entity18 students @entity16 and @entity19 in the @entity21 laboratories , uses a tiny chip , the @entity23 , to produce scent signals using olfactive information , which are then sent out and received by connecting an app - @entity26 - to @entity28			1
and @entity15 says the chips will soon be able to send thousands of different smells			0
