there was a time not so long ago when @entity1 was regarded as little more than a glamorous accessory for her then famous footballer husband @entity3			1
she was one of the original wags – wives and girlfriends of @entity9 footballers – whose elaborate grooming , surgical enhancements and excessive spending were carefully crafted to attract media attention			1
tanned , slender and always primped , with long glossy hair and perfect nails , @entity1 fitted the mould perfectly			1
she worked hard at looking good and devoted herself to her home , her husband and their two sons			1
playing for keeps : @entity21 and tanned @entity1 has forged a successful career of her own ‘ i was told i was nothing without @entity3 , just a pretty bimbo , ’ she says			1
‘ now , he ’s being referred to as @entity1 ’s ex-husband			1
it ’s not a competition but i bet he does n’t like that			1
’ one senses that , secretly , she hopes it grates more than a little with her ex. for @entity3 walked out on @entity1 and their two sons @entity35 , now 18 , and @entity36 , 13 , in 2010 to be with mezzo - soprano @entity37 , who has appeared in @entity38 shows and recorded an album of @entity40			1
despite the fact the marriage had been tempestuous , largely due to her husband ’s ‘ dark moods ’ , a devastated @entity1 took to her bed weeping			1
but eventually she picked herself up and began re-inventing herself , working hard to forge a career as a television presenter – specialising in fashion and celebrity interviews			1
ex : @entity51 , pictured playing for @entity52 in 1993 , walked out on @entity1 and her two children in 2010 earlier this year , at 45 , she made her @entity55 acting debut , starring in the satirical musical @entity56 , to great critical acclaim			1
she has two film roles lined up , more television appearances in the pipeline and plans to work in @entity61			2
perhaps the only jarring note in her otherwise upbeat life is that when her 18 - year marriage officially ended in divorce recently , it was the former @entity56 who had to pay her errant ex-husband a ‘ substantial ’ financial settlement			1
‘ i think i married the wrong footballer , ’ she says without malice			1
‘ instead of him having to pay for leaving me and the boys virtually penniless , i ’m the one who will have to give him money			2
' he is still a presenter on the radio channel @entity77 but claims to be broke			2
’ she added : ‘ frankly , i think he ’s wasted a lot of cash			2
he continues to live the high - spending life of a top football player			2
so , i feel i ’m paying for his lifestyle			2
’ most women would resent having to fork out money to a former spouse who had an affair , dumped her and claimed poverty			2
but @entity1 says it ’s a small price for freedom			1
‘ it ’s liberating because i feel it ’s now my time to show what i can do , ’ she says			2
‘ i have a good brain , whatever people think when they see me dressed up			2
’ convent - educated @entity1 is hardly a typical @entity56			1
her late father , @entity98 , was art director at the @entity100 advertising agency while her mother was a senior manager for fashion house @entity102			2
she was expected to go to university , but decided to become a model after being spotted by the great fashion photographer @entity106			2
stage presence : @entity1 , right			1
was praised for her starring role in the musicals @entity56 by the time she met and married @entity3 , a working - class boy from @entity111 , 19 - year - old @entity1 had modelled for @entity112 and @entity113			1
she had aspirations to become an actress , but quickly shelved them for life with @entity3			2
he was at @entity119 ’s football academy and went on to play for @entity52 and @entity120			2
@entity1 turned down primetime television jobs with @entity122 and as @entity124 ’s sidekick on @entity125 , to start a family			1
@entity3 , she says , did not want her to work full time			2
but plagued by injuries and two bouts of testicular cancer , during which @entity1 nursed him back to health , @entity3 retired in 2002 and became a radio presenter			1
by the time they parted three years ago , @entity1 was already a recognised face on the red carpet			1
‘ @entity3 decided he wanted to have a life elsewhere and left me with two children to bring up , ’ she says			1
‘ i ’ve had to work really hard to make sure they have the lifestyle they are used to			2
that ’s been my motivation			0
‘ i could have crumpled and gone to pieces – in fact , i did for a while – but i had two boys to support			0
keeping a roof over our heads and putting food on the table became my priority			0
’ despite being devastated at the time , she argues it was the best thing that could have happened			0
‘ i ’ve never been happier			0
it ’s made me stronger and more independent			0
i ’m a grafter ; i have a lot of energy and do n’t need more than four hours sleep			0
but i never thought i would ever have to earn my own living			0
’ in the heydays of @entity3 ’s career , she was totally dependent on him			1
it was , she accepts , a privileged life			0
there was the obligatory mansion in leafy @entity166 , expensive cars , exotic holidays and closets stuffed with designer clothes			0
‘ back then , wags were not expected to be more the arm candy			1
but @entity173 , @entity174 and myself broke the mould by working and making a name for ourselves			0
’ @entity1 was at the 2006 @entity178 in @entity179 , where the @entity182 squad ’s wags gained more publicity - not all of it positive - than the team			1
the manager blamed them for the less than stellar performances on the pitch			0
four years later , she was a special guest presenter for @entity192 ’s @entity191 programme during the @entity193 in @entity194			0
those who know her well say she is genuinely kind and loyal and possesses a ‘ wicked ’ sense of humour			0
these are some of the qualities that led to her becoming known as the @entity56 - ony aunt			0
‘ the other wives and girlfriends would come to me with their problems , because they knew i ’d been through it all before , ’ she explains			0
‘ they still do because they know i ’m honest and discreet			0
‘ adultery has been a big issue			0
there is a lot of temptation for high - profile players			0
when i first started seeing @entity3 , girls would send him pictures of themselves naked			0
party person : @entity1 , left , can be spotted out and about with famous figures like @entity215 contestant @entity215 , right ' you have to have a strong relationship to trust your partner not to stray			1
’ she ended up with an advice column in a well - known glossy magazine			0
these days , however , @entity1 wants to be taken seriously as a presenter and actress			1
‘ the musical @entity56 was a huge risk because i felt a lot of people expected me to fail , ’ she says			0
in the end , the production ran for eight weeks and the theatre was packed every night			0
it was , she says , such a triumph that @entity230 has bought the movie rights			0
‘ it ’s going to be a cross between @entity234 , @entity235 and the @entity236			0
the finances are in place and i ’ve been told i will keep my stage role			0
’ but before that she is looking forward to interviewing actor @entity241 before an audience at the @entity243 later this year			1
and she is starring in a movie with @entity245 , called @entity246			0
she has had to prove herself many times over because , she says , people believe if a woman cares about her looks , she must be an airhead			1
‘ people constantly underestimate me			0
because i ’m more than a @entity56			0
‘ do n’t get me wrong , it ’s not that i hate being called one			0
after all , the tag has certainly helped to make me who i am today , but it ’s not like i ’m still married to a footballer so i think it ’s time to bench it			1

@entity1 , 45 , was one of the original wags
she was totally dependent on her footballer husband @entity51
he left her and her two sons in 2010 for another woman
but now she has forged a successful career for herself
and she now supports him financially after their divorce last year
