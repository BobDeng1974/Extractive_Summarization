@entity1 diplomats twice confronted their @entity3 counterparts about an open letter from @entity6 senators who warned that any nuclear deal could expire the day president @entity8 leaves office , a senior @entity3 official said monday			1
the official , noting the administration 's warnings when the letter first surfaced , said the @entity6 intervention was a new issue in the tense negotiations facing an end - of - month deadline for an agreement to reduce @entity1 's ability to produce a nuclear weapon in exchange for loosing @entity24 sanctions			1
the letter came up in nuclear talks sunday between senior @entity3 and @entity1 negotiators , the official said , and the @entity1 raised it again in discussions monday in @entity31 , @entity32 led by secretary of state @entity33 and @entity1 foreign minister @entity34			1
' it is necessary that the stance of the @entity3 administration be defined about this move , ' he was quoted as saying			0
@entity33 and @entity34 met for nearly five hours in @entity31 , the start of several planned days of discussions			1
most of the @entity1 then departed for @entity56 , where they were to meet with @entity58 negotiators			0
in @entity56 , @entity60 foreign policy chief @entity59 said that ' we are entering a crucial time , a crucial two weeks			0
' and @entity64 foreign minister @entity63 said that after ' more than ten years of negotiations , we should seize this opportunity			2
' the @entity3 and @entity1 are plunging back into negotiations in a bid to end a decades - long standoff that has raised the specter of an @entity1 nuclear arsenal , a new atomic arms race in the @entity72 and even a @entity3 or @entity74 military intervention @entity3 secretary of state @entity33 takes a break during a bilateral meeting with @entity1 foreign minister @entity34 over @entity1 's nuclear program ' there are areas where we 've made progress , areas where we have yet to make any progress , ' @entity80 foreign secretary @entity79 said			1
' but the fact that we 're all here talking shows the commitment on both sides to try to reach an agreement			0
' in @entity31 , the @entity3 official would n't say how much time the sides spent talking about the letter drafted seven days ago by freshman sen. @entity94 of @entity95 and signed by 46 other @entity6 senators			1
the @entity1 have called the letter a propaganda ploy , and @entity34 joked last week that some @entity3 legislators did n't understand their own @entity100			1
the @entity101 has called the letter ' ill timed ' and ' ill advised , ' coming weeks before the deadline for a preliminary agreement with @entity1 on its nuclear program			2
in the end , the talks and a potential agreement depend on @entity1 showing the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , said the @entity3 official , who briefed reporters only condition of anonymity			1
the goal for a full agreement is the end of june			0
@entity3 energy secretary @entity116 , @entity3 secretary of state @entity33 , @entity1 's foreign minister @entity34 and the head of the @entity121 @entity120 , from left to right , pose for a photograph before resuming talks over @entity1 's nuclear program @entity6 argue that a deal would be insufficient and unenforceable , allowing @entity1 to eventually become a nuclear - armed state			1
to that end , they 've delivered a series of proposals to undercut or block an agreement , including ones that would require @entity132 say - so on a deal and order new sanctions against @entity1 while negotiations are underway			0
@entity94 's letter , the administration and congressional democrats argue , went further , interfering in the president 's execution of @entity3 foreign policy			2
the letter , styled as a @entity3 civics lesson , warned @entity1 leaders that any deal negotiated by the current administration could be tossed by @entity8 's successor			1
@entity8 and other officials insist they 're not going to make any deal that would allow @entity1 to acquire nuclear weapons			2
the agreement taking shape would limit @entity1 's uranium enrichment and other nuclear activity for at least a decade , with the restrictions slowly lifted over several years			0
from left , @entity64 foreign minister @entity63 , @entity60 high representative @entity59 , @entity1 's foreign minister @entity34 and @entity80 foreign minister @entity79 stand for a group photo prior to a meeting in @entity56 on monday @entity159 and other world powers also would gradually scale back sanctions that have crippled the @entity1 economy			1
@entity163 says it is only interested in peaceful energy generation and medical research , but much of the world suspects it harbors nuclear weapons ambitions			0
@entity33 and @entity34 plan to regroup in @entity31 on tuesday			0
the @entity3 secretary of state is to return to @entity159 by week 's end for talks with @entity172 's leaders , and the @entity1 plan to break for the @entity173			2
officials say talks might restart sometime next week , if necessary			0
a deal would also require the approval of @entity3 's negotiating partners : @entity80 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity64 and @entity181			0
with little time remaining before the end of march , some officials have said the persistent differences mean negotiators will likely settle for an announcement that they 've made enough progress to justify further talks			0
such a declaration would hardly satisfy @entity3 critics of the @entity8 administration 's efforts			2
but the senior @entity3 official said the goal was to determine by the end of march ' if we can get to a political framework that addresses the major elements of a comprehensive deal			1
