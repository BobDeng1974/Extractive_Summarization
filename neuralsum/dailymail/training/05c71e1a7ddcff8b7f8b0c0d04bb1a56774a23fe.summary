by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 [ published ] [ updated ] the race - row that has engulfed @entity5 referee @entity4 intensified further today as two @entity7 players claimed they heard him call teammate @entity8 a ' monkey '			1
it has emerged that the pair of unnamed stars say this is what happened during their match with @entity15 on sunday - but the official categorically denies making any racist comments			1
@entity4 has been accused of saying to @entity8 : ' shut up you monkey ' as he booked him for dissent as well as calling @entity21 a ‘ @entity23 t * * * ’ in their 3 - 2 defeat at @entity26			2
but a source close to the referee told @entity46 : ' he said nothing of the sort - and he will fight this all the way			1
' there is a lot of noise on the pitch and the players could have easily misheard			2
' [ related ] meanwhile , @entity7 's race case against @entity4 is in serious danger of collapsing completely after it emerged that the club have employed independent lawyers to investigate the claims of their players			1
the club are expected to conclude their internal investigation into allegations that the referee racially abused @entity8 and swore at @entity21			0
the external lawyers will then provide @entity7 with legal opinion as to whether their case will be successful			1
despite issues over the available evidence , @entity7 remained robust			1
in the spotlight : @entity8 leaves @entity7 training on tuesday as the row hangs over the club @entity4 , who has been taken off the @entity5 match list this weekend , has protested his innocence since his controversial handling of @entity7 ’s 3 - 2 defeat by @entity15 on sunday			1
@entity79 police have charged two @entity81 footballers with ' violence ' following an under - 21 international between @entity81 and @entity79 that led to ugly scenes			2
no charges were levelled against @entity79 fans making racist chants at @entity81 players or for causing a brawl			0
@entity89 of the @entity91 ' federations said the ' racial abuse of @entity81 players was disgraceful ' and he called on @entity79 to deal with those responsible with ' vigour '			0
a further two officials from @entity97 's backroom staff were also said to have been charged after the match erupted following the final whistle			0
' further to the @entity79 police announcement regarding charging @entity103 under - 21 players and staff , the @entity100 can confirm it has not received any formal notification of any charges filed , ' the @entity100 said			1
players and officials from both teams clashed on the pitch after @entity112 's late goal secured @entity81 's passage to next year 's finals			2
the unsavoury scenes were played out amid allegations of racist chanting from the stands directed at @entity119 full - back @entity120			0
video footage appeared to reveal the crowd targeting @entity124 , who was red - carded after the whistle , and who has subsequently complained about the treatment he received			0
now it has emerged that @entity7 are fearful of the backlash if the players have misheard or misjudged @entity37 ’s conversations during the stormy clash against @entity15			1
@entity7 will proceed with the case against the referee only if they are satisfied the claims made by the players after the game will stand up to the @entity100 ’s burden of proof			1
it means they will need to satisfy an @entity100 commission ‘ on the balance of probability ’ , but they also have to negotiate the complexities of the @entity149 ’s investigation into the affair			0
if the case breaks down , it will reflect badly on @entity7 , who made their claims of inappropriate language against @entity37 in a strongly worded statement on sunday , two hours after the final whistle			1
earlier it emerged that the club and @entity8 could be charged with misconduct by the @entity100 after the midfielder had to be restrained from manhandling the referee in his dressing room following the clash			0
@entity4 did not mention the behaviour in the ‘ extraordinary incident ’ report he filed on sunday , but he now has to make a detailed statement to the @entity100			0
@entity4 ’s assistants , @entity168 and @entity169 , and fourth official @entity170 have filed reports in which they say they did not hear the @entity173 official say anything inappropriate			0
all four were in the referee ’s room when @entity8 burst in with @entity7 chief executive @entity177 and manager @entity178			2
@entity8 ’s aggressive manner , along with the behaviour of other @entity7 officials , raises the possibility of @entity100 action against the club			2
all smiles : @entity8 was back with his team - mates in training amid the race row focus : @entity21 drives into @entity7 's @entity190 ahead of wednesday 's clash with @entity15 at the wheel : @entity193 was also among the players training on tuesday morning both @entity8 and @entity21 claim they have a witness to @entity4 ’s comments , and @entity199 chief executive @entity198 , who has assessed both complaints , told @entity201 the pair have his ‘ 100 per cent support ’			1
however , it has emerged that the allegations about the referee ’s comments were made only after a debate in the @entity7 dressing room			1
@entity8 and @entity210 were discussing the alleged use of racist language and were then quizzed by senior @entity7 players about what they had heard before the matter was taken further			1
sunday ’s controversy is also the subject of a police investigation and @entity37 will be interviewed by them as well as the @entity100 , who are conducting a separate inquiry into his handling of the clash			2
the @entity199 had a delegate at the game and he has discussed the matter with @entity198 , who said : ‘ the main thing is that the police investigation will not affect the process at the @entity100			0
‘ we are supportive of the players and they have our 100 per cent backing			0
i find it difficult to believe that @entity7 ’s players would make something like this up			1
at the same time i find it hard to conclude that a referee could say something of this nature			0
’ @entity4 found an unlikely ally in @entity242 manager @entity241 , who said he was disgusted with @entity7 for ‘ trying to kill ’ the official			1
@entity241 , preparing for @entity242 ’ @entity244 win over @entity245 last night , was critical of the accusations against @entity4 , who enraged @entity7 by sending off @entity193 for diving when replays showed he had been fouled			2
@entity241 said : ‘ you know my relationship with referees but i have to say i am disgusted with what ’s gone on			0
i ’m on @entity37 ’s side			2
we ask referees to man - manage and that ’s what he does			0
i ’m sure he might have said a few things but are you telling me if @entity7 had won that game that there would have been one iota of a complaint ? ‘ i hope if it is proved wrong , that the players , whatever they alleged @entity4 to have said , get done as well			1
i think he made a mistake but they are trying to kill him and i do n’t agree with that			0
’ in a further development , police chiefs upgraded security at @entity26 for the @entity244 tie against @entity15 as tension between the teams threatens to escalate			0
in the spotlight : @entity4 leaves his home near @entity275 on monday grabbing a lift : @entity4 jumped into a car with fellow ref @entity278 sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

two players have told teammates this is what @entity5 official said in alleged outburst
@entity37 *confident* he will be cleared of wrongdoing , with source saying : ' he said nothing of the sort - and he will fight this all the way '
@entity7 's legal case could collapse as it has gone to external lawyers who may believe the claims made by players do not stand up
