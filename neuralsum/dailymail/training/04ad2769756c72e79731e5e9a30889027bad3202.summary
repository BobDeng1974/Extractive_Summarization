a @entity0 photobombed astronauts making repairs to the @entity3 earlier this month - setting off a wild frenzy of speculation online			2
the spooky incident happened on october 7 , when flight engineers @entity8 of @entity10 and @entity11 of the @entity12 conducted a spacewalk outside the @entity4 to fix an electrical problem			1
in video shot by @entity10 and uploaded to @entity16 last week , the @entity0 can be seen hovering just for a few seconds behind the astronauts , before the camera cuts to another angle			1
scroll down for @entity20 what is it ? the astronaut is seen making the repairs in the center of the frame - while circled in red is the @entity0 as always , the size and shape of the mysterious craft could not be made out and of course , the footage appeared grainy			0
the @entity0 appears during the video at around the 1.50 minute mark and the apparently elliptical craft hovers a short distance behind one the astronauts			1
work : the astronauts carry out their work on the @entity4 just moments before the @entity0 became visible intricate : the three astronauts are seen here at the beginning of the video around one minute before the @entity0 appears according to the examiner one possible explanation for the @entity0 is that it could be one of two resupply craft that visited the @entity4 the @entity48 ship arrived at the @entity4 on september 23 and that space ship was followed up two days later by a @entity51 14m craft that brought three new crew members			1
however , both the craft are currently docked with the @entity4 and the @entity0 in the video appears not to be attached to the @entity4 a more likely explanation than a craft piloted by beings from another planet observing human astronauts is lensflare			2
light could easily have bounced off the @entity4 and refracted onto the camera			0
but , observers have pointed out that there does n't seem to be a strong source of light near to the astronauts when the @entity0 is seen			0
this may rule out lensflare and keeps the object confirmed as a genuine @entity0 .			0

@entity0 appears very *briefly* during @entity10 @entity16 video uploaded last week
shot during a spacewalk on october 7 - the @entity0 has to date been *unexplained*
