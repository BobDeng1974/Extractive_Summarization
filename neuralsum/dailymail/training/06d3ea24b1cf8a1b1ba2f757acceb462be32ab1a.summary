@entity1 's midfield options are becoming stretched at just the wrong time , with @entity3 facing at least six weeks on the sidelines			1
the 25 - year - old will not play again this year after sustaining ankle ligament damage in wednesday 's late 1 - 0 defeat at @entity8			1
@entity3 's absence compounds an increasingly tough situation for @entity1 in central midfield , with @entity12 and @entity13 also out of contention for monday 's match with @entity16			1
@entity3 ( right ) battles for possession with former @entity1 team - mate @entity19 @entity3 suffered ankle ligament damage against @entity8 on wednesday night the midfielder ( right ) had to be substituted during the match and will miss the nest six weeks @entity24 has helped fill the void in the past two matches but he is a doubt with a hamstring injury - hardly the ideal preparation for manager @entity30			1
' i went to the training centre this morning about some updates of the players , ' the @entity31 said ahead of his clash with compatriot @entity37			0
' @entity3 has ankle ligament ( damage ) and he will be out for maybe more than six weeks from what i heard from the doctor			2
' @entity13 is doing well but he 's not fit for monday			2
it 's not really a hamstring injury , it 's more fatigue in his muscle and he 's doubtful for monday			0
' maybe yes , maybe not , we have to wait , the game is on monday and now we have two or three days more			0
' @entity24 ( left ) looks unlikely to play after being forced off with injury at @entity8 fellow midfielder @entity13 is also out of monday 's game with @entity16 @entity51 has been passed fit to face @entity16 , but @entity30 will not be fast - tracking @entity52 back from a fractured foot			1
that leaves @entity1 struggling for numbers in central midfield , meaning 19 - year - old @entity57 could make his first @entity58 start alongside the likes of @entity60 and @entity61			1
' he is ready , ' @entity30 said			0
' he 's a young player and he has to develop himself , but always i 'm a manager at a club who likes to have development of young players			0
that means also that you give chances to play			0
' i did n't choose @entity70 when @entity13 went off in the game against @entity72 because of the level of competition , the physical strength in that game			2
@entity24 did it fantastic and the reason i did the same ( against @entity8 when @entity3 went off )			2
' @entity70 played last monday and young players need to play every week and he 's an option for this monday			0

@entity3 has damaged ankle ligaments and will not play again this year
@entity12 and @entity13 are also missing
@entity57 , 19 , could make his first league start against @entity16
