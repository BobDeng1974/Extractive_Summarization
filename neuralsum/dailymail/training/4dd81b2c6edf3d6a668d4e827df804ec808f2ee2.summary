by @entity0 published : 01:01 est , 25 may 2013 updated : 07:29 est , 25 may 2013 the trucker was hauling drilling equipment when his load bumped against the steel framework over an @entity6 bridge			1
he looked in his rearview mirror and watched in horror as the span collapsed into the water behind him			0
two vehicles fell into the icy @entity13			1
amazingly , nobody was killed			0
the three people who fell into the water escaped with only minor injuries			2
officials are trying to find out whether the spectacular collapse of a bridge on one of the @entity23 's most important roadways was a fluke - or a sign of a bigger problem with thousands of bridges across the @entity27 authorities focused first on trying to find a temporary span for the @entity13 , although it wo n't come in time for the tens of thousands of @entity31 vacationers who would travel between @entity33 and @entity34			1
traffic on @entity6 and surrounding roads was backed up for miles , a situation the governor said would continue indefinitely			1
officials were looking for a temporary , pre-fabricated bridge to replace the 160 - foot section that failed , @entity44 said friday			1
if one is found , it could be in place in weeks			0
if not , it could be months before a replacement can be built , the governor said			2
the spectacular collapse unfolded about 7 p.m. thursday on the north end of the four - lane bridge near @entity88 , about 60 miles north of @entity34 and 40 miles south of the @entity33 border			1
' he looked in the mirrors and it just dropped out of sight , ' @entity90 , the wife of truck driver @entity91 , said from the couple 's home near @entity97 , @entity98			1
' i spoke to him seconds after it happened			0
' the truck driver works for @entity104 in @entity98 , the @entity102 said			2
the tractor - trailer was hauling a housing for drilling equipment southbound when the top right front corner of the load struck several of the bridge 's trusses , the patrol said			1
@entity91 , 41 , remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators			0
he voluntarily gave a blood sample for an alcohol test and was not arrested			0
@entity91 has been driving truck for 20 years and hauling specialized loads for more than 10			2
' he gets safety awards , safety bonuses ... for doing all these checks , for hiring the right pilot cars and pole cars , ' his wife said			2
initially , it was n't clear if the bridge just gave way on its own			1
but @entity102 chief @entity128 blamed it on the tall load			0
the truck made it off the bridge , but two other vehicles went into the water about 25 feet below as the structure crumbled			1
@entity137 and his wife were in their pickup heading to a camping trip when he said the bridge before them disappeared in a ' big puff of dust			2
' ' i hit the brakes and we went off , ' @entity137 told reporters from a hospital			2
damage : the first pictures of the scene show that both the north and southbound lanes of the @entity6 highway collapsed on thursday evening just before 7pm rescue : three people were initially pulled from the water alive , though there remained concerns about other possible passengers who were trapped by debris collapse : the section of the interstate 5 bridge over the @entity13 is seen in an aerial view @entity167 , of @entity88 , said the bridge seemed to explode in front of him			1
the 20 - year - old slammed the brakes and could see the edge of the pavement approaching , but there was nothing he could do			0
' it was like time was frozen - like a roller coaster where you 're not attached to the tracks , ' @entity167 said in a phone interview			0
' i 'm sure it was just one of the loudest sounds ever to hear this thing explode and fall into the water like that , but i did n't hear a thing			0
i just witnessed it happening in front of me			0
' @entity191 , vice president of @entity192 , said in an interview with the @entity0 that state officials had approved of the company 's plan to drive the oversize load along @entity6 to @entity198 , @entity40 , and the company hired a local escort to help navigate the route			1
@entity202 , a state @entity205 spokesman , confirmed the truck had a permit			0
' we 're still trying to figure out why it hit the bridge , ' @entity202 said			1
' it 's ultimately up to the trucking company to figure out whether it can get through			0
' state officials approved the trucking company to carry a load as high as 15 feet , 9 inches , according to the permit released by the state			1
however , the southbound vertical clearance on the @entity13 bridge is as little as 14 feet , 5 inches , state records show			1
that lowest clearance is outside of the bridge 's vehicle traveling lanes , @entity205 communications director @entity222 said friday			1
the bridge 's curved overhead girders are higher in the center of the bridge but sweep lower toward a driver 's right side			2
the bridge has a maximum clearance of about 17 feet , but there is no signage to indicate how to safely navigate the bridge with a tall load			0
the permit specifically describes the route the truck would take , though it includes a qualification that the state ' does @entity244			0
' it 's not rare for trucks to strike bridges in @entity40 - it 's just that such accidents do n't usually cause the structures to collapse			1
the state @entity205 said there were 21 bridge - strikes involving trucks last year , 24 in 2011 and 14 in 2010			0
officials performed a special inspection six months ago of the bridge that collapsed because there were indications it had been struck by a different vehicle			2
desperate search : eyewitnesses said that they could hear a man screaming from one of the trucks that fell in the water troubled water : both the north and south bound lanes of the interstate were effected so much of the nearby highway was closed in order to prevent any other accidents scary : though the water was not particularly deep where the collapse occurred , there were a number of other factors that could prove threatening for the passengers inside the cars , like this overturned one questions : there are unconfirmed reports that a large truck hit something to unsteady the bridge but investigators are still looking into what caused the unexpected collapse a report released friday says the checkup was done due to ' impact damage , ' and inspectors identified tears , deformations and gouges on the northbound side of the bridge			1
the report also summarizes a variety of parts on the bridge that have been subjected to ' high - load ' hits			0
in that nov. 29 , 2012 , impact , an overheight truck struck a metal overhead truss on the bridge , @entity205 spokeswoman @entity305 said			2
an inspection crew ' thoroughly investigated and determined the bridge to be safe , ' with only minor repairs required			0
she said those minor repairs were added to an existing list of bridge maintenance items to be completed at a future date			0
there are no signs leading up to the @entity13 bridge to warn about its clearance height			1
state transportation secretary @entity322 said that under federal and state standards , the clearance is tall enough to not require signage			0
@entity44 said it will cost $ 15 million to repair the bridge			1
the federal government has already promised the state $ 1 million in emergency funding			1
traffic could be affected for some time			0
the bridge is used by an average of 71,000 vehicles a day , so the roadblock will cause a major disruption in trade and tourism			0
the closest detour is a bridge about a quarter mile east of @entity6 , which is mostly used by local traffic between @entity88 and @entity343			1
officials are also recommending detours using state routes 20 and 9 that add dozens of miles to a trip			0
hopeful : crowds gathered on the river bank as the rescue crews bring survivors out of the water viewing the scene : crowds gathered on the top of the bridge as they tried to assess the damage location : the bridge itself is in a rather remote area between the towns of @entity343 and @entity88 but the interstate itself is a major thoroughfare that connects @entity34 to @entity33 a @entity368 database lists the bridge that collapsed as ' functionally obsolete ' - a category meaning that the design is outdated , such as having narrow shoulders and low clearance underneath			1
but it was not classified as structurally deficient			0
the 1,112 - foot - long bridge , with two lanes in each direction , has four spans , or sections , over the water supported by piers			2
it 's a steel truss bridge , meaning it has a boxy steel frame			2
the northernmost span is the one that collapsed			0
the mishap was reminiscent of the august 2007 collapse of an @entity389 in @entity390 that killed 13 people and injured another 145 when it buckled and fell into the @entity392 during rush - hour			2
the @entity394 determined that the @entity390 bridge failed because steel gusset plates that connected the structure 's beams and girders were too thin .			1

four lanes of @entity6 fell into the @entity13 in @entity40 between the towns of @entity343 and @entity88
@entity394 inspectors are investigating the events surrounding the collapse
bridge repair will cost $ 15 million , @entity40 's governor says
police : an oversized drill rig *casing* on a truck hit a bridge girder , leading to the collapse
officials : the bridge was listed as " functionally obsolete , " but that does n't mean unsafe
government safety inspectors raised concerns about the bridge in the past
