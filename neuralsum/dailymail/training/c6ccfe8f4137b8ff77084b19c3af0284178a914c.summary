by @entity1 reporter once famous for their stiff upper lip , @entity2 have succumbed to an epidemic of ‘ oversharing ’ thanks to a steady diet of x factor sob stories and revealing @entity10 posts			1
a survey of 1,000 adults shows that the natural @entity2 reserve has been eroded when it comes to talking about previously taboo subjects such as sex			1
growing numbers are prepared to spill the beans on personal issues in a way that would have horrified previous generations			2
the study revealed that one in four people think @entity2 is a nation of oversharers			1
blame @entity25 : confessional television chat shows such as the @entity27 are to blame for @entity28 now sharing more than their parents ' generation many have been influenced by seeing celebrities openly discuss their addictions or depression , confessional television such as the @entity27 or back stories on talent shows			1
more than half ( 51 per cent ) say they are more likely to talk about the topic they rated the most blush - inducing of all - sex - than their parents would have been at the same age			0
but even six in ten ( 57 per cent ) of today ’s over 60s , many of whom grew up in the liberated sixties , are more open to talking about sex than previous generations			0
more than one in three ( 38 per cent ) @entity28 are more open to discussing personal health problems than their parents were when young			2
seeing celebrities such as @entity55 open up about their emotional issues or troubled pasts have also led to ' oversharing ' yet it is money which remains one of the most awkward areas of discussion for many , with many unwilling to tell others how much they earn , for instance			0
only 29 per cent felt they are more likely to raise the subject than an older generation			0
a spokesman for laundry brand @entity72 , who commissioned the survey , said : ‘ as increasing numbers of people turn to social media to chat to friends and share their innermost thoughts in the public domain , it ’s no surprise that a quarter of people feel we are now so comfortable tackling sensitive subjects that we have actually become a nation of oversharers			1
‘ @entity88 reinforces the idea that there ’s something to gain from sharing sensitive information about yourself			0
‘ and social media is making it easier than ever for people to do so without having to deal with the embarrassment of a face to face conversation			0

personal trouble and sex are no *longer* taboo subjects for @entity28
