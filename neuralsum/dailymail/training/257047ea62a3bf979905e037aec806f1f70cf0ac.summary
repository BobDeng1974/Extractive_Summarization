the £ 4billion @entity1 tv rights tender goes into a second round on tuesday morning with revised bids due by midday			1
the seven packages are expected to be awarded later in the day			2
although the @entity7 and @entity8 have shown interest , the most likely scenario is that @entity10 will retain four prime packages			1
@entity12 , meanwhile , will get an increased number of games , up to 56 out of the 168 live matches being sold per season for three years			1
competition from @entity18 and @entity8 could the push price per match to £ 8m overall , the likely cost will be around £ 8m per game			1
however , @entity10 retaining the 4pm sunday slot package , which has the most first picks attached to it , will allow them to dominate the choice of games as they have done since the start of the @entity1			2
the bids were tabled for the seven packages - starting in 2016 - 17 - by a noon deadline on friday , but there was no immediate verdict from the @entity1 , as there was a week earlier for the highlights rights won by @entity35			1
@entity10 have brought @entity37 legend @entity36 ( right ) into their star studded line - up of pundits @entity41 will get an increased number of games , up to 56 out of the 168 live matches being sold per season who will be bidding in the auction for domestic live rights to the @entity1 ? @entity10 and @entity12 , who currently share coverage , will both be involved again			1
they paid £ 3.018billion between them for the 2013 - 16 rights			1
that is expected to rise for 2016 - 19 , and potentially soar to £ 4bn if other serious bidders enter the auction , such as @entity55 - based giant @entity18 and @entity56 - owned @entity8			1
will @entity10 lose matches this time ? it ’s feasible			2
under the current deals , @entity10 have 116 live games per season , and @entity12 have the other 38 games , for a total of 154 live games per season , which were sold in seven packages			1
the auction for 2016 - 19 also has seven packages for sale but more games overall			2
five packages have 28 games per season and two packages have 14 games			0
about a dozen of the extra games will be shown on friday nights			0
@entity10 has dominated the showing of live games since the inception of the @entity1 in 1992 any one broadcaster will be allowed a maximum of 126 games per season — or four ‘ big ’ packages plus one ‘ small ’ package			1
that ’s what @entity10 currently has and will want to keep			2
they will almost certainly be willing to pay more than the £ 2.28bn over three years they paid last time			2
but will another major player splash the cash and reduce what @entity10 have ? @entity12 have deep pockets			1
they spent £ 897m on @entity91 and @entity92 live rights for three seasons starting 2015 - 16			1
they wo n’t want less than the 38 @entity1 games they have now and can be expected to bid strongly			0
the real unknown is whether @entity18 and @entity8 will come in with blockbuster bids			0
that could blow the market open and send prices soaring , again			0
who are @entity18 and what personalities might we see on our tvs if a new bidder wins the rights to @entity1 matches ? @entity18 are a @entity55 - based global media company that started in the 1980s with one documentary channel			2
they are now extremely wealthy and own a majority stake in @entity112			0
their chief executive was reportedly in @entity115 last month to meet @entity1 officials for talks about a bid for @entity120 rights			0
if @entity18 win the rights to some matches the assumption is they would show them on @entity112 , which has never televised live @entity1 games			0
they would try to hire or poach established names , possibly from @entity10 or @entity12 if those two lose games			1
@entity8 already have former @entity10 frontmen @entity130 and @entity132 working for them in @entity56			2
@entity8 have already recruited former @entity10 presenter and pundit @entity132 ( left ) why is there such fierce competition for @entity1 games ? a generation ago virtually nobody in @entity120 paid to watch tv over and above their licence fee			1
now around 60 per cent of households ( or 16m homes ) pay for a subscription whether @entity10 , @entity144 or @entity12			1
increasingly , the battle between these communications giants is for the ‘ triple play ’ market ( phone , internet and tv from one source ) and the ‘ quad play ’ market ( which adds mobile phones )			0
they want you to get all your services from them			0
live @entity1 matches are being used in an attempt to influence your choice			0
with millions of people paying £ 600 - plus a year for these services , it ’s a massive industry			2
if another broadcaster enters the arena , tv fans may find they have to pay for another subscription will @entity1 football cost me more from 2016 - 17 ? will i need more subscriptions ? it ’s feasible that @entity10 and @entity12 will share the rights again in broadly the same way they do now , and fans wo n’t notice any difference to pricing			1
but if a third or even fourth broadcaster gets involved more subscriptions will be needed , almost certainly at extra cost			0
although if @entity10 lose a lot of games they may have to reduce prices to keep customers			2
will the clubs get richer ? oh yes			0
the total broadcasting pot for the 2013 - 16 period was more than £ 5.5bn , mostly from domestic live rights ( £ 3.018bn ) and foreign rights ( £ 2.23bn ) with highlights , near - live rights and mobile rights on top			1
the 2016 - 19 total pot is expected to be close to £ 7bn with £ 4bn from domestic rights			1
the vast bulk of the cash will end up being split among the @entity1 clubs			0
@entity1 clubs like leaders @entity200 will get even richer following the new tv deal @entity1 fans are not expected to see a reduction in ticket prices following the sale will ticket prices go down ? you ’re having a laugh , are n’t you ? almost certainly not and not by much in any case			0
many @entity1 games are sold out or nearly sold out , even though ticket prices are the most expensive in the world			0
while the demand is there , clubs will charge what they can			0
the only rider to that is that the @entity1 hierarchy would like to see clubs offer more cheap deals , particularly to away fans and younger people			0
it remains possible that an increase in tv money will allow more subsidies for schemes like this ... but do n’t bank on it .			0

the £ 3.01bn for 2013 - 16 rights paid by @entity10 and @entity12 is expected to rise
increased competition could push price per match to £ *8million*
@entity10 are expected to retain the four prime broadcast packages
