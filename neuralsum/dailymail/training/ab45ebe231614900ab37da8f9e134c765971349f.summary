a seven - year - old who developed narcolepsy after having the swine flu vaccine has been refused compensation because he is not ill enough – despite the fact he sleeps for 19 hours a day			1
@entity5 developed the condition within three weeks of receiving the injection and now suffers ‘ attacks ’ which can cause him to doze throughout the day			1
until he started medication he fell asleep up to every five minutes - even when he was walking , eating and swimming - and suffered sudden seizures when he laughed			1
@entity5 ( pictured with his mother , @entity11 ) developed narcolepsy within three weeks of having the @entity14 jab			1
without medication , he falls asleep up to every five minutes earlier this year , the government admitted that the @entity14 jab could be to blame and @entity5 ’s mother @entity11 hoped she would get financial assistance to deal with his condition			1
but @entity5 has now been told he does not have a ‘ severe ’ enough disability to qualify for compensation			1
ms @entity22 , 42 , declared the decision ‘ disgusting ’ and said the condition had irreversibly changed his life			0
she said : ‘ at the end of the day this vaccine has irreversibly changed his life forever and there ’s nothing we can do about this			0
‘ he has to take a very , very strong cocktail of drugs each day just to get through the day			1
’ @entity5 received the vaccine at his local gp surgery on january 21 , 2010 after his mother was told he was ‘ at risk ’ of the @entity38 virus because he was under five			1
ms @entity22 hoped to receive compensation to help her pay for @entity5 's care but she was told that he is not ill enough to qualify for a payout but ms @entity22 , of @entity42 , @entity43 , said that within weeks of him having the vaccine she noticed a drastic change in her son			1
‘ he was a perfectly healthy energetic four - year - old before the vaccination , but within two weeks he was getting more tired and after three weeks he was sleeping for 19 hours a day			2
‘ things then developed quickly and he struggled to walk			0
‘ nothing could convince me it was anything but the jab which caused @entity5 ’s conditions			1
‘ the government had a knee - jerk reaction to swine flu and put out this vaccine , giving it to very young children			0
’ ms @entity22 , 42 , declared the decision ' disgusting ' and said the condition had irreversibly changed @entity5 's life @entity5 is now on medication to control the condition but the family lives in constant fear of narcolepsy attacks			1
ms @entity22 , a civil servant , said : ‘ @entity68 can trigger attacks and sometimes he is too anxious to go out for fear of an incident			0
‘ you see other children who can laugh and enjoy things and yes @entity5 can laugh and enjoy things but his reaction means that he goes unconscious			2
‘ we feel we are constantly treading on eggshells			0
’ the vaccine was widely used in the @entity78 during the 2009 to 2010 flu pandemic and was given to almost one million children between the ages of six - months - old and five - years - old			0
ms @entity22 said : ' at the end of the day this vaccine has irreversibly changed his life forever and there 's nothing we can do about this			0
he has to take a very , very strong cocktail of drugs each day just to get through the day ' however , since 2011 it has not been given to people under the age of 20 because of the risk of narcolepsy			1
the @entity78 @entity97 has found that giving the jab to young children increases their chance of developing narcolepsy by 14 times			2
researchers estimate that the chance of developing narcolepsy after receiving a dose of the vaccine is somewhere between one in 52,000 and one in 52,750			0
last month , the government made a dramatic u-turn over @entity5 ’s condition , admitting that , ‘ on the balance of probability the jab contributed to his condition ’			1
@entity5 received the vaccine at his local @entity118 surgery on january 21 , 2010 after his mother was told he was ' at risk ' of the @entity38 virus because he was under five but they then added : ‘ it has not been accepted that disablement from vaccination is severe , i.e. at least 60 per cent			1
’ families could be entitled to £ 120,000 through the @entity127 if they can prove ‘ severe ’ disability			2
but ms @entity22 said : ‘ basically to get compensation you need to have something along the lines of loss of eyesight , loss of hearing , loss of limbs or basically not being able to do anything at all which i think is absolutely disgusting			0
’ the @entity78 @entity97 has found that giving the jab to young children increases their chance of developing narcolepsy by 14 times a spokesperson for the @entity147 , which runs the @entity127 , said : ‘ @entity147 has looked at some vaccine damage payments cases again in light of new information regarding swine flu and narcolepsy provided by the @entity153			2
‘ we can not comment on the specifics of individual cases but can confirm that once this new information was taken into account it was decided , on balance of probability , in some cases that causation was proved			0
’ ms @entity22 has now applied for legal aid to appeal against the decision			0
narcolepsy , which occurs in one in every 2,000 people , is a sleep disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times			2
it is a long - term neurological condition that disrupts normal sleeping patterns			2
symptoms include , sleep attacks , daytime sleepiness and cataplexy - temporary muscle weakness in response to emotion			0
it is often caused by an autoimmune response - this is when antibodies are released by the body but instead of destroying disease , they attack healthy cells			0
in the case of narcolepsy , antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce a sleep - regulating chemical			2
there is currently no cure but the condition can sometimes be managed , for example , by taking regular naps , eating healthily and exercising			2
in some cases , medications such as antidepressants or stimulants can also help			0
it is thought that for every 55,000 children who were given the jab , @entity14 , one has developed narcolepsy			1
researchers , who published their findings in the @entity209 , studied 75 children with narcolepsy and found that 11 of these had received the vaccine before their symptoms began			0
the vaccine is associated with a 14-fold increase in a child 's risk of developing the condition			0
since 2011 , the @entity219 has prevented the use of @entity14 in people under the age of 20 .			1

@entity5 fell ill within three weeks of having the @entity14 jab
takes a cocktail of drugs without which he falls asleep every five minutes
he even falls asleep while eating , walking and swimming
his mother hoped for financial assistance to deal with his condition
was told he does *n't* have a ' severe ' enough disability to qualify
since 2011 the injection has not been given to under - 20s because of risk of narcolepsy
