@entity57 ’s contract , signed last year , sees him earn a reported £ 292,000 after tax in @entity74			1
( you can read about the different taxes in each country here )			2
he is often regarded as the best footballer in the world - although he lost the @entity83 crown to @entity84 this season - so it is apt he is paid accordingly			2
his accolades , just like his salary , are certainly not in short supply			2

he is also a three - time winner of @entity96 and became the first player to score five goals in a @entity100 match			2
in addition to his gargantuan salary , @entity57 makes millions more every year from endorsements , the biggest of which is @entity63 , who launched his ' icon signature ' line in 2013			2
reported @entity16 : £ 288,000age : @entity109 : real @entity110 : @entity113 @entity112 sponsors : @entity21 , @entity23 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity66 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 @entity84 is reported to earn £ 288,000 after tax , in a deal similar to his @entity124 rival @entity57			2
he is currently reported to be in contract extension talks with @entity126 , so he could see himself rocketed to the highest paid footballer once again soon			2
importantly , he also owns a 50 - 50 share of his image rights			0
his popularity on social media sites like @entity132 and @entity133 have translated into big bucks from sponsors like @entity21 , @entity114 and @entity115 , all of which he promotes through his own social media accounts			0
not content with monopolising the advertising world , @entity84 also launched himself into the fashion industry as the ‘ spokesmodel ’ for @entity141 and @entity142 in 2009			0
in march , a ' @entity143 ' compiled by @entity144 was topped by @entity84 , with an estimated net worth of around £ 122million			0
frightening talent : @entity113 's @entity84 is the best player in the world at the moment reported @entity16 : £ 250,000age : @entity149 : @entity18 : @entity150 sponsors : @entity21 , @entity63 , @entity151 , @entity152 with many an achievement to his name , including @entity156 and the @entity157 ’ @entity83 , it ’s no wonder @entity159 left @entity160 to chase for club honours			0
born in @entity162 , @entity159 is currently the all - time top scorer for @entity163			0
he is also one of world football 's top earners			0
he has been part of major commercial campaigns for huge corporate brands , including @entity21 , @entity151 and @entity152 , all of which have rendered a tidy sum for the @entity171			0
twisting and turning : @entity172 is set to link - up with @entity163 coach @entity173 at @entity31 in the money : the @entity176 's @entity175 has had a very public spat with @entity178 recently reported @entity16 : £ 230,000age : @entity179 : @entity180 : @entity181 sponsors : @entity182 , @entity183 with a four - year contract that pays him over £ 10million a year , there is no surprise that @entity188 is among the top earners on the pitch			1
the @entity176 midfielder has had a distinguished international career with 82 caps for the @entity176 , representing the team in their first appearance in a @entity3 in 2006 and again in 2010			1
@entity188 has won the @entity196 for the last three consecutive years			0
in addition to his rewarding salary , he also signed an endorsement deal with @entity182 that includes distributing the brand ’s gear to underprivileged @entity203 children			0
he is one of the only non-strikers on the list - but despite this , was third top scorer in the @entity53 last season chipping in with 20 goals for @entity178 helping them win the title			1
his future at the club is in doubt however because of a falling - out over a birthday cake			0
reported @entity16 : £ 220,000age : @entity59 : @entity214 : @entity62 sponsors : @entity182 , @entity152 multiple leg injuries have resulted in a bit of a stop - start career at @entity178 so far for the @entity219 , nicknamed ‘ @entity220 ’			0
however , this has not hindered his relationship with the club who , in may 2013 , agreed to give him a contract extension and salary increase that not only keeps him with the club until 2017 but also makes him one of the highest paid football players in the world			0
@entity233 dresser : @entity178 's @entity219 striker @entity234 is on £ 220,000 - a - week at the @entity235 reported @entity16 : £ 220,000age : @entity236 : @entity237 : @entity238 major sponsors : @entity63 despite @entity241 ’s turbulent tenure with @entity242 , involving multiple suspensions and an attempted escape to @entity160 , he enhanced his reputation as a world - class footballer last season forming a deadly partnership with @entity249 @entity248 and in turn , earns one of the highest salaries of the @entity53			1
as @entity238 ’s all - time leading goal scorer with 39 for the national team , @entity241 commands the top wage at @entity242 after he was rewarded with a new contract in december			1
he was seen as a national hero when he helped lead his country to a fourth place finish in the @entity260 after blocking a goal bound header from @entity263 in the quarter - final with his hands			0
he was sent off , but @entity263 missed the penalty and @entity238 went on to go through to the next round			0
putting his foot through it ! @entity241 is fighting to get himself fit fort @entity238 's opener against @entity273 reported @entity16 : £ 200,000age : @entity17 : @entity180 : @entity275 sponsors : @entity63 nicknamed ‘ @entity279 ’ for his wizard - like passing abilities , @entity276 signed a five - year contract to make up a reported £ 200,000 a week playing for @entity178			1
since joining the club , the @entity282 midfielder has appeared in over 150 games in three seasons , winning the @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity53			1
he is famously described by his sponsor @entity63 as a ‘ new brand of player ’ with surgical precision and a brain for strategy			0
could he fire @entity74 to a second consecutive @entity3 win ? thinker : @entity276 will provide @entity74 with the incisive sort of intelligent play they are renowned for main man : @entity301 's @entity300 will be the main spark for dark horses @entity303 reported @entity16 : £ 185,000age : @entity305 : @entity306 : @entity308 sponsors : @entity21 currently regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation , even compared to the likes of @entity314 , it 's not hard for @entity301 to rationalise spending a reported £ 185,000 a week on the @entity315			1
with rumours circling that @entity300 is a target for @entity318 , the @entity319 have said they are prepared to pay the big bucks to keep hold of him – so he could race up this list in the near future			1
although approached by @entity63 , @entity300 has remained loyal to his long - term sponsors @entity21 , with a renewed endorsement contract that is said to make him one of their leading football faces along with @entity84 , @entity25 , @entity329 and @entity330			0
incredible ! @entity331 might be struggling for goals for @entity301 and @entity74 but he makes the top 10 reported @entity16 : £ 175,000age : @entity149 : @entity306 : @entity334 : @entity63 , @entity152 , @entity335 , despite his outrageously large salary , all that glitters is not gold - throughout his time at the club , @entity331 has been a disappointment for @entity301 with many a second - rate performance			1
it 's a far cry from the prolific period he spent at @entity242 , where he became the fastest player in the club 's history to score 50 league goals , but something has n't clicked since his £ 50million move to the @entity347 in 2011			0
in spite of this , he has been capped over 100 times for his country and is @entity74 ’s third - highest goalscorer of all time			1
he also has a couple of high profile endorsement deals with @entity63 and @entity152 , as well as a few domestic @entity282 brands , boosting his income .			0
