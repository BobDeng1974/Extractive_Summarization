the report revealed one in seven new mothers now think the photoshoots are a positive idea , claiming stretch marks and baby weight ‘ celebrated them becoming a mum ’			2
but one in 12 mums said they would only have a post-pregnancy photoshoot if they got their bodies back into shape			0
@entity159 ’ - which see women trying to fall pregnant take their pregnancy test with a group of friends or family members - are also on the rise			1
popular in @entity162 where the parties are often filmed for @entity164 , the trend is starting to take off in the @entity165 with one in 25 mums saying they had held one and a further 14 per cent admitting they would consider it			1
