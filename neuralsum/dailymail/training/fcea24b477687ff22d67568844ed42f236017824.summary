by @entity0 last updated at 7:05 pm on 4th july 2011 @entity2 ’s six - week murder trial finally rested today as jurors were sent away to decide whether her two - year - old daughter was the victim of an accidental drowning that she covered up out of fear and grief , or was brutally murdered by a ' pathological liar ' who wanted to live free and party			1
judge @entity12 dispatched the jury in @entity14 , @entity15 , to consider their verdict after the state delivered an emotionally stirring rebuttal to the defence ’s closing arguments , telling the panel of seven men and five woman that @entity2 died in june 2008 at the hands of ' the most well documented liar ever seen in a courtroom			1
' @entity27 scowled , shook her head and at times mouthed her objections as prosecutors @entity32 and @entity34 closed out their assertion that @entity2 was suffocated deliberately by her mother and tossed in the woods to rot			1
pensive : @entity2 listens to the prosecution 's rebuttal on the last day of arguments in her murder trial her decomposed remains were found in december 2008 with duct tape over her skull , where her nose and mouth would have been			2
the defence ’s suggestions that her grandfather @entity27 put it there while disposing of her body was ' laughable ' and ' oh so predictable , ' jurors were told			1
' accusing others of lying is classic @entity2			2
when @entity2 wants to turn attention away from herself , she accuses others , ' said ms @entity62			2
' a lie told convincingly is still a lie			0
' defence attorney @entity64 told jurors during closing arguments yesterday that @entity2 ’s death was an ' accident that snowballed out of control ' after @entity2 clambered alone into the swimming pool at her home in @entity14 , @entity15			1
@entity27 was an ' amazing mom ' who was afraid of how to handle it and ' made some bad decisions			2
' ' she should have called police			0
she should n’t have attempted to block it out			0
she should have reported her death , ' he said			0
' but to paint @entity2 as a slut , as a party girl , as a girl who lies , has nothing to do with how @entity2 died			2
' ' absurd ' : prosecutor @entity32 rejected the defence 's claim that @entity2 drowned in a pool in his final rebuttal family : @entity27 and @entity2 , parents of @entity2 , leave court after the jury was sent out ms @entity34 countered today : ' what ‘ amazing ’ parent acts with complete indifference to the accidental death of their child ? ' she asked			1
' if this really was an accident in the pool , @entity2 would have been found floating in a pool , not floating in a swamp down the street			1
people whose children have accidents do something … they call 911 , they anguish over the death of a child			0
' instead , @entity27 , 25 , spent 31 days spinning yarns about her daughter being in the care of a nanny who turned out to be fictitious , went shopping , went to parties , went nightclubbing , and got herself a tattoo reading ' @entity118 ' – @entity119 for ' beautiful life ' – until the child ’s grandmother @entity121 called police			2
' at the end of this case , all you have to really do is ask yourselves one simple question : whose life was better without @entity2 ? ' ms @entity34 told the jury			2
' was @entity121 ’s life better ? ' she asked , playing a recording of the distraught grandmother weeping down the telephone to an emergency despatcher in july 2008 that @entity2 was missing			0
decision : judge @entity12 told the jury that their decision must be unanimous as they were sent out on monday ' was @entity27 ’s life better , ' she demanded , reminding them how @entity2 ’s grief - stricken grandfather attempted suicide after the little girl ’s remains were found because he wanted to be with her			1
' whose life was better ? ' asked ms @entity34 in her final words to the court , pointing to a photograph of @entity150 , and an image of her @entity153 tattoo			0
' there ’s your answer			0
' @entity27 has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse , aggravated manslaughter and lying to law enforcement			0
the first - degree murder charge carries the potential of the death penalty			1
all 12 jurors must agree for a guilty verdict to be delivered , though a subsequent death sentence would only require the agreement of seven			0
tears : @entity2 yesterday broke down during closing arguments in her murder trial final : @entity2 is seen before the start of court yesterday as both sides gave their final arguments the jury was selected from @entity178 , @entity15 , 100 miles from @entity14 , because of the enormous media spotlight that has been on the case ever since @entity2 ’s disappearance in june 2008 , before @entity27 was even arrested			1
defence lawyers had argued that @entity27 risked receiving an unfair trial , resulting in the judge and lawyers on both sides travelling to @entity178 to swear in jurors who they agreed were not tainted by the pre-trial publicity			1
the panel has been sequestered since selection , meaning that they have not been allowed home for more than six weeks and have been protected from coverage , including being denied access to live television and allowed to read newspapers only with holes cut in them where coverage of the trial was published			0
victim : mystery surrounds the cause of @entity2 's death addressing jurors before dispatching them to their deliberations , judge @entity12 gave a timely reminder of the significance of the july 4 date – the 255th anniversary of @entity211 ’s @entity210 – and the legal responsibility now resting on their shoulders			1
' even if you do n’t like the laws that must be applied , you must use them , ' he said			0
' for two centuries , we have agreed to a constitution and to live by the law			0

jurors start deliberating on whether @entity27 should face death penalty
prosecutors slam defence claim that daughter @entity2 drowned in pool
judge tells jury to use common sense and that decision must be unanimous
