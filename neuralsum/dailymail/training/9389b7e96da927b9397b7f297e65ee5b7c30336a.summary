only a very small number of the messages have so far been made public , leading to claims of a cover - up by @entity36 and the inquiry			1
a furious mr @entity2 rejected a @entity39 demand by @entity41 mp @entity40 two weeks ago to disclose all the texts and emails exchanged with mrs @entity3 , the former chief executive of @entity43 's @entity8 , which is at the centre of the phone hacking scandal			1
her husband , racehorse trainer @entity20 , is an @entity47 chum of the prime minister			0
mr @entity40 suggested mr @entity2 's refusal was because the messages were ' too salacious and embarrassing for you '			2
he rounded on the prime minister : ' when the truth comes out , you wo n't be smiling			0
' when livid mr @entity2 refused to reply , mr @entity40 , himself a phone hacking victim , accused the prime minister of a ' hissy fit '			2
to add to the intrigue , mr @entity40 claims to have had contact with a no 10 ' mole ' involved in compiling mr @entity2 's texts and emails , whom the mp says has confirmed their ' salacious ' nature			2
cosy : @entity3 ( right ) was in close contact with the prime minister @entity2 the @entity4 obtained details of two embarrassing texts exchanged between mr @entity2 and mrs @entity3 , who awaits trial next year on charges of phone hacking and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice			1
both texts were sent in october 2009 , shortly after mrs @entity3 left her job as editor of @entity79 and became chief executive of @entity8 , which owns the paper			1
in one , mr @entity2 writes : ' the horse @entity20 [ @entity20 ] put me on			0
fast , unpredictable and hard to control but fun			0
' he signed off ' dc. ' embarrassing : the newly leaked messages sent by @entity3 and @entity2 admission : @entity2 , pictured at a party with mrs @entity3 in 2009 , was embroiled in the controversy surrounding the @entity89 lending a horse to the @entity92 editor in another , sent after his speech to the @entity17 conference , mrs @entity3 said : ' brilliant speech			1
will love “ working together			0
” ' they shed further light on the extraordinarily close relationship between mr @entity2 and mrs @entity3 , both members of the so - called ' @entity102 set ' based around their @entity104 homes			1
mrs @entity3 told the @entity105 earlier this year that mr @entity2 signed some of his missives to her ' lol ' – until she told him it meant ' @entity108 , ' not ' @entity109 '			1
horseplay : the texts were about a police horse , this one pictured on duty the light - hearted tone of mr @entity2 's leaked text echoes the way he reportedly congratulated mr @entity20 when he started his relationship with mrs @entity3 , saying : ' you 'd better not mess this one up , @entity20			1
it 's the most important ride of your life			0
' today 's fresh disclosures are bound to lead to further @entity41 demands that all messages between the pair are made public so the true nature of their relationship can be seen			1
mr @entity2 and mrs @entity3 met 22 times in a six - year period , an average of once every three months			1

mr @entity2 has gone out of his way to play down his connection with 44 - year - old mrs @entity3			1
he was caught out when it was revealed he had ridden a retired police horse , @entity143 , lent to mrs @entity3 by the @entity89			1
the disclosure came amid claims that @entity8 paid backhanders to police while pressuring them not to investigate phone - hacking			2
the prime minister spent days trying to deny having ridden @entity150 , but eventually admitted it and was forced to make a grovelling apology – in the middle of an @entity155 summit – for trying to conceal the fact			0
it seems unlikely mr @entity2 was referring to @entity158 in the newly leaked text , as the horse was 22 years old when lent to mrs @entity3 by the @entity89 in 2008 and would have been put down otherwise			2
the animal is now dead			0
the ' horsegate ' saga was not the first time mr @entity2 had tried to cover up his horse - riding exploits with the @entity20			0

he now faces criminal charges , too			0
it is believed the @entity105 also has unpublished texts and emails between mr @entity2 and mr @entity164			2
@entity29 ordered mr @entity2 and mrs @entity3 to send a vast amount of correspondence , including emails and texts , to the inquiry , but only a small number were published			1
' i am so rooting for you tomorrow and not just as a personal friend but because professionally we 're definitely in this together			0
' mrs @entity3 the inquiry 's lead @entity190 , @entity191 , said he would only use ' relevant ' texts and emails			1
the new leaked texts are believed to have been supplied to the inquiry by mrs @entity3			1
among the texts disclosed during the inquiry was one sent by mrs @entity3 to mr @entity2 on the eve of his @entity17 conference speech in october 2009			1
in it , she gushed : ' i am so rooting for you tomorrow and not just as a personal friend but because professionally we 're definitely in this together			0
' referring to another issue , she said : ' let 's discuss over country supper soon			0
' it concluded , excruciatingly , ' speech of your life ? yes he @entity214 ! ' crucially , the first line of the text , said to be ' humorous ' , was not read out on the grounds it was ' not relevant '			0
the two texts published today by @entity4 were not revealed either			0
mrs @entity3 's ' i cried twice ' text , was sent immediately after the speech , in which mr @entity2 spoke movingly of the death of his disabled son , @entity225			2
the prime minister 's text about riding one of her husband 's ' fast , uncontrollable ' horses was in the same month			0
