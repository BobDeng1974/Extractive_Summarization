the @entity1 outbreak in @entity2 has so far killed more than 9,300 people it is a debate that has been raging since the @entity1 epidemic reached crisis point last year			1
will the vicious disease , which has killed more than 9,300 people , mutate to become an airborne virus potentially making it infinitely more deadly ? health experts have firmly proclaimed @entity1 viruses are not airborne and can only be transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids			1
but an international team of scientists have now thrown that assertion into doubt			2
in an opinion piece published in @entity20 , the journal of the @entity22 , the team make their case			0
they reviewed past studies examining past outbreaks of @entity1 within human populations , as well as animal studies			1
their aim ? to establish what is known and what is not known about how the virus spreads			0
and their findings conclude , that while current knowledge is nowhere near complete , airborne infectious @entity1 particles are likely to play some role in transmission			1
' it is very likely that at least some degree of ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract , the respiratory tract , or medical procedures , although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out , since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to and in direct contact with an infected case , ' they wrote			1
they go on to suggest that @entity1 viruses do have the potential to evolve in the future into airborne pathogens , ' particularly if extensive ongoing human transmission results in selective virus evolution '			1
but professor @entity59 , a virologist at the @entity60 told @entity1 remains a blood borne infection and as a result is very unlikely to spread through airborne particles			1
he said he has ' absolutely no issue at all ' that if you were to generate some droplets contaminated with @entity1 , they could be a potential source of infection , because of the route the virus takes via mucus membranes			1
but , he cautioned , it is a ' leap of faith ' to suggest the virus can therefore be transmitted via an airborne route			2
' the reality is that this virus ends up in the blood stream , that 's where most replication happens , ' professor @entity59 told @entity80			0
' it is a blood borne virus , therefore it is difficult to say how the virus could set up the lung associated infections which would generate the symptoms associated with respiratory transmission , through sneezes and coughs			2
' the bottom line is if you say airborne to the general public they start to immediately think the virus could be spread through someone coughing			2
' the reality is there is no evidence it is changing the way it behaves			0
' @entity98 , a virologist at the @entity60 agreed			0
he said the possibility @entity1 might travel through the air is ' interesting from scientific perspective ' , but he warned ' talking about it as if it is actually happening in @entity2 right now would be irresponsible speculation '			1
he told @entity80 : ' the study in question poses some interesting " what if " questions for researchers to ponder , and we should n't get carried away			0
' @entity1 is just not well adapted to spreading except by contact with bodily fluids			1
' as part of their analysis @entity116 and colleagues noted a few animal studies have pointed to the possibility that @entity1 could potentially spread via aerosols			1
one piece of research revealed two monkeys developed the virus 10 and 11 days after the death of infected monkeys kept in an enclosure three meters away			1
those infected with the disease were housed in the same room but efforts were made to ensure they were separated from the control group of three monkeys			0
the researchers suggested the two control monkeys had been infected through aerosol , oral or conjunctival exposure to droplets carrying the virus			2
they added that studies of the dead monkey 's lung tissue supported the theory they had become infected via airborne particles			1
similarly in another study , four caged macaques monkeys became infected with @entity1 after being placed close to six infected piglets			1
the animals were separated by a wire barrier , and the piglets were kept at least 20cm from the macaques ' cages at all times			0
the researchers concluded that while the virus could have spread through airborne particles , other routes were also possible , including droplets landing on items in the cages			1
experts assessing past studies looking at how the virus spreads , have concluded that airborne transmission of the virus is ' very likely at some degree ' but , in contrast , dr @entity116 and his team did also note another study where two monkeys did not contract @entity1 despite being placed next to two infected animals in open - barred cages for several days			1
the team 's argument hinges on the need , they believe , for a revision of the traditional ideas around how viruses are transmitted			0
currently it is accepted that transmission happens in one of two ways			0
a new test that can diagnose @entity1 in just 15 minutes has been approved by the @entity182 ( @entity182 )			2
the @entity183 is based on detection of the @entity1 protein in the blood			2
@entity182 said the test is rapid , easy to perform and does not require electricity			0
' it can therefore be used at lower health care facilities or in mobile units for patients in remote settings , ' the @entity190 health agency added			0
the new method is less accurate than the nucleic acid tests ( @entity197 ) that have previously been used but offers a far quicker way of identifying the disease			0
the agency said @entity197 require established laboratories and fully trained personnel and can take between 12 and 24 hours			0
when compared with the results of an @entity197 previously listed by @entity182 and currently being used in the field , the new test was able to identify about 92 per cent of @entity1 infected patients and 85 per cent of those who were not infected with the virus			1
the agency said it is therefore recommending that where possible , results should be confirmed by using an nat as well			0
dr @entity98 , lecturer in virology at the @entity60 , said : ' the new antigen test is not a game - changer , but it is another useful tool in the fight against @entity1			2
' the new test is small , cheap and portable , but is less sensitive than the gold - standard test that is used to diagnose early - stage @entity1 in the clinics now			2
' the new test could help to quickly confirm outbreaks in remote areas without the need to send samples to a testing clinic and wait for results			0
' the new test is n't about saving the lives of infected people , but it can help in the long run by making it easier and quicker to detect @entity1 outbreaks			1
' either large droplets make direct contact with the skin or a mucus membrane , or a person becomes infected with a virus by inhaling small airborne particles at a distance from the source			1
but the authors say these models fail to recognise that infectious aerosols ' include suspended particles in a wide range of particle sizes that are easily inhaled by someone standing near the point of generation			2
' thus , aerosol inhalation can occur both near and far from an infectious source '			0
they note that vomiting caused by norovirus is known to produce infectious aerosols that cause the illness to spread			0
but add , norovirus is not thought of as a respiratory virus			0
they believe that could also be the case for @entity1 , because infectious suspended particles may be generated by vomiting , diarrhoea and coughing			2
to test their theory , dr @entity116 and his colleagues created ebola virus aerosols and sought to find out their decay rates			0
their findings estimate that the @entity268 strain , that triggered the epidemic in @entity2 , can survive in suspended airborne particles for around 100 minutes			1
despite their assertion that @entity1 could already be airborne , dr @entity116 and his colleagues acknowledged direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected patient remains the primary way the virus spreads			1
they noted the virus has been found in saliva , breast milk , urine , and the semen of sufferers			2
meanwhile they also found viral dna has been found in sweat , tears and stools , as well as in rectal , conjunctival , vaginal and skin swabs			0
and the authors note that the available data on how @entity1 spreads is very limited , leaving their findings uncertain			0
they said the evidence available currently does not show the disease to be a primary lung infection			0
but they add it is worth asking whether this could happen in the future , noting it could be possible because the virus can be isolated from saliva and can infected cells found in the respiratory system			2
dr @entity116 and colleagues ultimately agree with the recognised advice that airborne transmission of @entity1 is unlikely because it would require the virus to mutate significantly			1
but , they add , ' with phenotypic changes ( physical or biochemical characteristics of the organism ) in the virus , aerosol transmission ... involving droplets of various sizes from cases in relatively close proximity to uninfected persons remains plausible '			1
admitting the epidemic still ever present in @entity2 took public health officials by surprise , they warned ' we should not assume that @entity1 viruses are not capable of surprising us again at some point in the future '			1
in october the @entity182 stated @entity1 is not an airborne infection and added it is not likely to become one			1
in a statement officials said airborne transmission ' has not been observed during extensive studies of the ebola virus over several decades ' dr @entity116 , director of the @entity334 , sparked the debate last september , in an opinion piece in the @entity337			1
he put forward the idea that @entity1 viruses could mutate to become transmissible through the air			0
acknowledging that public health experts were talking of the possibilty behind closed doors , for fear of generating hysteria , dr @entity116 warned ' the risk is real , and until we consider it , the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic '			0
such was the level of concern , that the @entity182 , responded			0
the agency said @entity1 is not an airborne infection and was not likely to become one			1
' @entity357 among humans implies inhalation of an infectious dose of virus from a suspended cloud of small dried droplets , ' a statement said			0
' this mode of transmission has not been observed during extensive studies of the ebola virus over several decades			2
' dr @entity116 , from the @entity368 , worked with experts from other @entity371 academic institutions , the @entity372 , the @entity268 , @entity373 , @entity374 , and the @entity182 .			0

debate over whether @entity1 will infect people through airborne particles has raged since the epidemic in @entity2 reached crisis point last year
now , new analysis of past studies , concludes it is ' very likely '
scientists noted research where healthy animals kept at a distance from infected ones died from the virus
but the team acknowledge the primary form of transmission remains contact with the bodily fluids of an @entity1 patient
say airborne infection is still ' plausible ' noting the virus surprised experts examining the @entity2 outbreak , and could do so again
