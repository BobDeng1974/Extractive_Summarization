by @entity0 published : 06:01 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 3 january 2013 a police officer accused of plotting to cook and eat women has demanded that prosecutors give him the names of 20 other suspected cannibals			1
@entity7 , who served with the @entity8 , insisted he needed to contact the alleged criminals to prepare his defence , because he was accused of being in league with them			1
police apparently have ' hundreds of thousands of e-mail and instant - message communications in which mr @entity7 and others talked about their violent sexual fantasies			1
' ' @entity19 discussions ' : @entity7 , who served with the @entity8 , says he needs to contact others with whom he engaged in perverted online chats to prepare his defence hearing : @entity7 's defence lawyers have pointed out that no women were hurt , although among his named ¿ victims ¿ are women who the @entity26 have established did know him however , prosecutors have so far identified only three of the 20 - plus alleged perverts @entity7 chatted with as potential ' co-conspirators '			1
this does leave open the possibility that there may be more , according to the @entity35 federal court filing seen by the @entity36			1
the three are identified in court papers as @entity41 , ' @entity38 ' and ' @entity37			2
' public defender @entity42 wrote : ' three weeks before trial , the defence needs to firmly know the identity of mr @entity7 ’s alleged co-conspirators so that it can conduct its pre-trial investigation			2
' indeed , effective trial preparation could uncover facts critical to mr @entity7 ’s defence in that the individuals with whom mr @entity7 was chatting likely will corroborate that they were engaging in fantasy role play with no intention of acting on their fantasies			1
' police declined to comment			2
@entity7 and his estranged wife @entity57 , 28			2
it was @entity57 's discoveries on @entity7 's computer that led @entity26 agents to her husband @entity7 's estranged wife @entity63 , 28 , tipped off police when she found sick internet messages detailing plans to abduct , rape , cook and consume 100 female victims			1
files found on the father of one ’s computer included one titled : ‘ @entity73 ’			1
it listed materials required including chloroform and rope as well as chronicling the practicalities of fitting a victim into an oven – her legs , he noted , would have to be bent			0
@entity7 also expressed a desire to cook one particular victim slowly – ‘ tying her onto some form of apparatus ’ and trying to ‘ keep her alive as long as possible ’			0
in a particularly chilling section of the internet transcripts read out in @entity91 during his bail hearing , @entity7 shared his hunger for ‘ girl meat ’ on @entity95 in an email exchange with an alleged co-conspirator			0
his defence maintain these were nothing but fantasies and have pointed out that no women were hurt , although among his named ‘ victims ’ are women whom the @entity26 have established did indeed know @entity7			0
two of them claim to have been ‘ stalked in an intimidating way ’ by the police officer , who served in @entity109 for six years			0
@entity7 plead not guilty to all charges , including illegally accessing the @entity111 to search out potential victims			0
he has been held without bail and if convicted faces life imprisonment			0
