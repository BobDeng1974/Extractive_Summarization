president @entity1 's chief spokesman refused on thursday to rule out the possibility that the @entity3 will strike a nuclear deal with @entity5 while the @entity6 holds several @entity3 captive – including a @entity9 journalist being tried by the mullahs ' @entity10 without public notice of the charges			1
the case is the mirror opposite of @entity16 , where the @entity17 announced steps toward normalizing diplomatic relations on the condition that president @entity23 release @entity3 @entity21 and a @entity16 citizen who had been a @entity3 intelligence asset			2
@entity17 press secretary @entity26 said efforts to slow down @entity29 's ability to create fissionable nuclear material that could be used in long - range weapons remain unrelated to the administration 's attempts to free four @entity3			1
' these two priorities have been raised on two separate tracks , but they are priorities nonetheless , ' he said			0
not ruling it out : @entity17 press secretary @entity26 said the @entity3 is n't linking the releas of prisoners in @entity5 to a nuclear deal with the @entity41 republic @entity42 : @entity3 secretary of state @entity43 ( left ) and @entity5 foreign minister @entity44 ( right ) discussed the cases of @entity3 held by @entity29 this week but no resolution was reached @entity26 did reiterate the @entity1 administration 's call for their release , but said balancing the intertwined hostage and nuclear talks is ' one of the more vexing and far - reaching policy challenges ' facing the @entity54 and the @entity55			1
the captives include @entity9 correspdent and @entity59 @entity58 , and @entity3 @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
@entity63 is officially considered ' missing ' because @entity5 has n't acknowledged holding him			0
@entity60 has been detained in @entity5 since august 2011 ' on false espionage charges while visiting his family in @entity5 , ' according to the @entity55			2
@entity61 has been held since september 2012 and was sentenced to eight years in prison for ' undermining national security ' – in reality a prosecution for helping @entity71 operate ' home churches ' that provide places for @entity5 's estimated 700,000 non-muslims to worship			1
at the time of his arrest , @entity61 was building a state - approved orphanage			0
@entity63 went missing in march 2007 on @entity79 , a place that foreigners can visit without visas			0
@entity83 has n't denied holding him			0
@entity58 was scheduled to appear before a @entity10 tribunal on thursday			0
' the @entity17 is certainly aware of @entity5 press reports stating that @entity58 's case has been referred to a court , ' @entity26 told reporters			1
' we continue to monitor the situation closely and to seek further information , ' and ' call for his immediate release			0
' he said secretary @entity43 had raised the @entity96 case during a meeting this week with his @entity5 counterpart @entity44 ' secretary @entity43 raised mr. @entity58 's case , ' @entity26 said			1
' that is an indication of how seriously the @entity3 takes this case			0
' @entity43 , he said , also called for the release of the other three captives			0
but ' at the same time , ' @entity26 insisted , ' we 've also been explicit about the fact that these conversations , while important , are separate ' from negotiations over @entity5 's nuclear program			1
@entity111 : @entity58 , an @entity5 - @entity3 correspondent for the @entity9 , has been indicted on unspecified charges and faces trial by a @entity10 – a process usually reserved for national security crimes held : @entity116 ( left ) and @entity60 ( center ) are definitely being detained by @entity5 's @entity41 government , while @entity62 ( right ) is officially missing but assumed to be a captive ' these two priorities have been raised on two separate tracks , but they are priorities nonetheless			1
' ' we believe these @entity3 citizens should be released , ' @entity26 told reporters			1
" and we also believe the @entity5 regime should take the steps that are necessary ' to end crippling economic sanctions and bring transparency to its nuclear ambitions			0
he dismissed concerns that president @entity1 has treated @entity5 with kid gloves , compared with his insistence that @entity16 release prisoners before a diplomatic deal could move forward			2
even with an agreement on the hostages , @entity26 said , ' the relations between the @entity3 and @entity5 would fall far from normal			2
' he cited ' their rhetoric and treatment of @entity141 , ' and said ' there are a whole host of concerns we have with the @entity5			0
' ' our concerns with @entity5 , ' he said , ' are part of a much longer list			0
' the @entity3 remains opposed to @entity5 's nuclear program			2
according to the @entity17 , @entity1 told @entity141 prime minister @entity150 on monday that @entity3 ' is focused on reaching a comprehensive deal with @entity5 that prevents @entity5 from acquiring a nuclear weapon and verifiably assures the international community of the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program			1

@entity1 press secretary says nuclear talks are on a ' separate track ' from efforts to free @entity3 held by @entity29
@entity59 @entity58 , a @entity9 correspondent , is being tried by @entity5 's @entity10 but the government wo n't say what he is charged with
@entity26 told reporters that efforts to free him and other @entity3 , ' while important , are separate ' from nuclear negotiations
@entity5 also holds @entity61 and @entity60 ; @entity62 is believed to be held but @entity29 wo n't *confirm* it
@entity17 calls the *problem* one of @entity3 's ' more vexing and far - reaching policy challenges ' but wo n't demand hostage releases in trade for normalized relations and relaxed sanctions as it did with @entity16
