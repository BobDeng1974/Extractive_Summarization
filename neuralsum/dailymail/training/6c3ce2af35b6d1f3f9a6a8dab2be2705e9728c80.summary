scientists are a step closer to developing a pill to cure dementia			1
a team in @entity5 were able to repair diseased brain cells taken from patients with a common form of the condition , for which there is no cure			1
they identified a gene variant that prevents neurons from forming properly , and managed to correct it through genetic engineering			1
the researchers found they could also correct alter the gene a compound that inhibited a chemical responsible for the gene mutation			1
they have hailed the discovery a breakthrough , believing it could pave the way for a new ' dementia pill '			2
scientists were able to repair diseased brain cells taken from patients with a common form of dementia , and say drugs could be developed to treat the condition the study used stem cells from three patients with a type of dementia called ' frontotemporal dementia ' , which accounts for about half of cases diagnosed in patients before the age of 60			1
there is currently no cure for this type of the condition , which runs in families			1
@entity46 disorders are the result of damage to neurons in parts of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes , gradually leading to behavioural symptoms or language and emotional problems			1
mutations in a gene called @entity59 ( progranulin ) are believed to be behind frontotemporal dementia , but versions of the condition in mice do not mimic all the features of the human type			1
so the @entity5 researchers recreated dementia in a laboratory dish using human @entity70 ( induced pluripotent stem cells ) to help identify a potential new treatment strategy			2
molecular biologist professor @entity73 , of the @entity74 , said : ' use of induced pluripotent stem cell technology makes it possible to model dementias that affect people later in life			0
' the technique involves taking skin cells from patients and reprogramming them into embryonic like stem cells capable of turning into other specific cell types relevant for studying a particular disease			2
1 regular exercise doing exercise three to five times a week for between 30 minutes and an hour is recommended			0
in the @entity93 , adults are urged to do 150 minutes of activity a week to promote health but barely a third manage it			0
2 give up smoking never smoking is recommended , but smokers who give up by the age of 40 can gain ten years of extra life , claim scientists			2
3 reach a healthy body weight a healthy weight is a ‘ healthy ’ body mass index ( @entity106 ) score			0
@entity106 is assessed by comparing height to weight , in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared			0
a healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 - above is overweight and obese			0
4 eat a @entity115 diet the @entity115 diet is high in fish , nuts , whole grains and ‘ healthy ’ fats such as those in olive oil , while low in red meat and dairy products			0
studies suggest three to five or more portions of fruit and vegetables with fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories			0
5 keep alcohol consumption low low or moderate alcohol consumption is classified as three or fewer units per day for men , two or fewer for women , with abstinence not treated as a healthy behaviour			0
a small 125ml glass of wine contains 1.3 units , while a pint of beer contains at least two units			0
professor @entity73 added the research could pave the way for a pill to treat frontotemporal dementia to be developed			1
she said : ' @entity148 models can now be used to better understand dementia , and in particular frontotemporal dementia , and might lead to the development of drugs that can curtail or slow down the degeneration of cortical neurons			1
' the patients in the study all carried a @entity59 mutation which prevented their immature @entity70 from turning into mature , specialised cells called cortical neurons , the cell type most affected in frontotemporal dementia			1
one of the top defective pathways in the @entity70 was a signalling pathway known as @entity164 , which plays an important role in the development of neurons			2
but genetic correction or treatment with a compound restored the ability of the @entity70 to turn into cortical neurons			1
taken together , the findings demonstrate the @entity59 mutation causes the defect in cortical neuron formation by altering the wnt signalling pathway			2
researcher dr @entity178 , of the @entity179 , added : ' our findings suggest signalling events required for neurodevelopment may also play major roles in neurodegeneration			0
' targeting such pathways , as for instance the wnt pathway presented in this study , may result in the creation of novel therapeutic approaches for frontotemporal dementia			1
' the researchers will now work to better understand what goes wrong in @entity59 mutated cells , as well as identify precise molecular targets that could then be used for drug screens			0
the study was published in the journal @entity200			0
it comes after a major research project published this month found simple lifestyle changes could see 80,000 people saved from dementia every year			2
the study suggests that people make changes earlier in life to cut the risk of developing the brain disease as they grow old			0
it said three million cases of dementia could be avoided in @entity93 by 2040 if people started regularly exercising their bodies and minds			0
@entity46 dementia is the result of damage to neurons in parts of the brain called the frontal ( pictured in blue ) and temporal ( pictured in purple ) lobes			1
there is no currently no cure and it runs in families			2

scientists were able to repair bran cells taken from patients with dementia
they had ' frontotemporal dementia ' which is common and runs in families
@entity46 dementia occurs as neurons become damaged
@entity241 were able to correct damaged neurons by genetic engineering
they found a gene variant that prevents neurons from forming normally
also used a compound that inhibited a chemical causing the gene mutation
