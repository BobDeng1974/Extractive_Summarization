they provide one of the great intrigues of the human race			2
for centuries scientists and psychologists have attempted to unravel the mysteries of twins and how siblings who share almost identical genetic make - ups can often be so different			1
now a landmark project by @entity12 - using both photography and science - has attempted to shed some light on our fascination with twins			1
beautiful image : six - year - olds @entity20 and @entity21 are just two of many subjects photographed for a @entity12 feature on the differences and similarities between twins scientists are intrigued by twins as they share an almost - identical genetic code , leaving differences between them down to environmental factors such as how many hours of sun they get			1
photogenic six - year - olds @entity20 and @entity21 are just two of many subjects portrayed in the @entity12 feature			1
@entity36 , of @entity37 , took the charming photo of the @entity21 girls , who both have mild autism , in which @entity20 is seen putting a protective hand on @entity21			1
‘ it 's very clear when you look at twins that much of what they share is hardwired , ’ researcher @entity43 told @entity12			1
‘ many things about them are absolutely the same			2
‘ but it 's also clear , when you get to know them , that other things about them are different			2
’ stars : the tennis duo @entity57 and @entity58 have won more than 70 championships between them , including a title at the @entity62 in @entity63 earlier this year another set of twins featured in the @entity12 study are @entity67 and @entity68 , of @entity69 , @entity70 , who have been truck - driving partners for 18 years			1
‘ we 're wired the same , ’ @entity73 , 53 , said			2
‘ he 's messier than i am			2
but we like the same music and share the same sense of humour			2
’ the brothers have driven more than three million miles together			0
' we 're wired the same			0
he 's messier than i am			0
but we like the same music and share the same sense of humour ' @entity73 on @entity68 the @entity12 study is the latest scientific exploration into the world of twins			1
one of the most famous studies was the ' @entity87 ' led by @entity88 , which looked at 65 pairs of twins separated in infancy from the 1970s			0
it showed that almost every psychological trait is mostly down to genetics			0
but as long ago as 1875 , @entity97 scientist sir @entity96 had made a similar observation			0
a whole century on , @entity100 psychologist @entity99 performed a study on twins ' intelligence beginning in the 1970s that ruffled many feathers in the scientific community			0
it helped him conclude that iq differences are largely down to inheritance - not education			1
this was a controversial view as experts had said for decades that intelligence was taught and not hereditary			0
on the road : @entity67 and @entity68 , of @entity69 , @entity70 , have been truck - driving partners for 18 years and driven more than three million miles together other examples of twins that have captured the public 's attention include @entity122 and @entity121			1
the troubled teenage @entity124 twins became known for their 11 - year sentences at @entity127 psychiatric hospital in @entity128 , @entity129 , for arson			1
@entity122 died aged 30 in 1993			0
twins are born with an almost - identical genetic code , but can still have surprising physical or psychological differences that mean they lead wildly different lives			2
for example , one can be left - handed and the other right - as in the @entity58 champion tennis brothers			1
or one can adapt better to unusual social situations than the other			0
but many decide to lead similar lives and even make something of the fact they are twins to help propel them to stardom - such as actors @entity144 and @entity146			2
scientists say twins often develop much closer bonds than fraternal brothers and sisters , which was shown by the notorious delinquent @entity124 twins ' secret language			0
but it was before their psychiatric sentence that they were most interesting to psychologists , as they developed a secret language and communication system , which appeared to be almost telepathic			0
another example emerged 10 years ago when almost 3,000 people were killed in the attacks on 9/11 - and 46 of them were twins			1
@entity162 thought about committing suicide after losing his twin brother @entity164 in the @entity37 attack			2
@entity37 firefighter @entity166 , 47 , arrived at the @entity168 scene shortly before the south tower fell and had seen his twin @entity171 ’s fire engine going ahead of him			2
' i said : “ i love you ” , ' said @entity166			0
' he said : “ i love you too , bro ”			0
you know , the weird thing about it is why did i say : “ i love you ” ? i rarely told my brother i loved him			0
i mean , because we knew it			0
it was just something you knew			0
’ meanwhile even today it was reported that the twin sister of the beautiful model who lost her hand and left eye in a plane accident in @entity191 , @entity192 , believes she can literally feel her sister 's pain , according to her mother			2
@entity196 had a horrific accident earlier this month when she collided with a plane propeller			0
famous twins : actresses @entity200 , left , are fraternal twins but their similar looks have helped them make a tidy fortune			0
identical @entity206 rowers @entity207 and @entity208 are pictured right identical : @entity210 , left , and @entity211 played @entity212 and @entity213 in the @entity215 films many twins gather for the @entity217 , which takes place every august in @entity219 , @entity220			0
the town was named by identical twin brothers almost 200 years ago			1
startling images : @entity12 's january 2012 issue scientists go to the event to learn more about twins , and at this year ’s festival there was a tent sponsored by the @entity231 and two universities , which used face - recognition software to tell apart twins			1
other researchers wanted to know if twins react differently to alcohol , reported @entity12			1
researchers also believe that disease must be at least somewhat hereditary if identical twins are more vulnerable to an illness than fraternal twins			0
@entity243 , of @entity244 , also took a number of photos for the @entity12 project - including one of the number one doubles team @entity57 and @entity58			1
the tennis duo have won more than 70 championships between them , including a title at the @entity62 in @entity63 earlier this year			1
the 33 - year - olds , who live in @entity255 , @entity256 , are so good at predicting each other ’s movements that some opponents joke that they must be telepathic			1
@entity58 measures 6 ’ 4 ” and weight 202lbs , while his brother comes in slightly lower at 6 ’ 3 ” and 192lbs			1
the photos are among many more in the january 2012 issue of @entity12 , which is on newsstands now			1
