by @entity0 published : 03:34 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 09:58 est , 1 june 2013 a @entity2 adventurer bidding to row across the @entity3 has told of the terrifying moment her boat capsized in the dark , bringing back awful memories of her failed attempt the previous year			1
@entity9 , 28 , has spent the last six days stuck in her tiny cabin , often strapped to her bed in case her rowing boat capsizes again			2
she is attempting , for the second time , to become the first person to row single handed the 4,500 nautical miles across the @entity3 from @entity17 to @entity18			1
her attempt last year was cut short after it was hit by the @entity20			1
if she completes the challenge she will become the first person to row single handed from @entity17 to @entity18 @entity9 shaved her hair for the trip and suffered seasickness early on			1
she trained for months for the voyage speaking from her cabin in the middle of the @entity3 , @entity9 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , told @entity39 she was hoping the weather would change today to allow her to resurface from her cabin and continue rowing			2
she said : ' it 's been a challenge so far			0
i always knew it would be a challenge to come back , both emotionally and also physically			0
' this ocean is a big , rough old ocean and i have certainly had my fair share of rough water so far			0
' the audacious attempt is in fact part of an even bigger challenge to loop the planet , using human power only , in her @entity57 : via the @entity60 expedition			1
she embarked on the challenge in april 2011 and the first year saw her cycle and kayak more than 11,000 miles from @entity63 to @entity27 , @entity17			1
but last year her attempt to row solo across the @entity3 had to be abandoned after her boat @entity66 was badly damaged after being battered by 15 metre high waves and 80mph winds in the tropical storm			2
home from home : @entity9 drys her socks in the afternoon sun on her makeshift washing line on board phoning in : she can keep in touch using a satellite phone from her cabin where she stores her food and sleeps the 28 - year - old is the first woman and the youngest person to row solo across the @entity84 which she completed in 2009 she then spent nine months back home preparing to take on the challenge again and on april 27 she set off from @entity17 in her second bid to complete the six - month journey			1
@entity9 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , said she had rowed 1,100 miles east of @entity17 in just over a month at sea in her new boat , @entity92			1
she still has about 3,200 miles to go before she reaches @entity18 , but has already capsized twice			2
she said : ' the first time was a bit of a relief actually because i was very nervous about it			0
' last year i capsized 20 times and it was really a frightening experience to be in the cabin with the water coming in , so i was quite nervous about it			0
' all alone : she plots her journey from her cabin			0
she stores six months worth of food on board and uses a desalination machine to convert seawater into drinking water to cook , drink and wash charity : @entity9 's aim is to raise more than £ 100,000 in sponsorship for her good causes - @entity117 ! , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 but while she may have been ' relieved ' to survive the first capsizing , it was a much more frightening experience when her boat overturned for a second time this week			1
she said : ' two nights ago i capsized in the dark and that really shook me up and brought back lots of memories of last year			0
' this last week has been really quite rough weather and the wind has been blowing from the east , so it means it 's both dangerous and i ca n't row in the direction i want to , so it 's been pushing me back to @entity17 , which means i have been consigned to the cabin for the last six days			2
' and when it 's rough , in case you capsize , you have to strap yourself to the bed , so i have literally been laid down for six days , strapped to my bed which has been really quite uncomfortable			0
' rescue : @entity9 first attempted the row in may last year , but the challenge was cut short when she hit a typhoon several hundred miles off the coast of @entity17			1
she is pictured here being rescued by the @entity17 coastguard she was forced to abandon her boat @entity66 after being battered by 15 metre high waves and 80mph winds rescuers help @entity9 to safety after her boat capsized more than 20 times and suffered irreparable damage but she was hoping to be able to start rowing again today as the weather was due to change			1
she said : ' that is the good thing about being out here , it 's a really good reminder that nothing lasts forever - you get some weather coming in but it will change after a few days			0
' it looks like i should be able to start rowing again tomorrow			0
' i 'm definitely looking forward to having a good stretch and eating some cooked food			0
@entity9 is aiming to raise more than £ 100,000 in sponsorship for her good causes - @entity117 ! , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
