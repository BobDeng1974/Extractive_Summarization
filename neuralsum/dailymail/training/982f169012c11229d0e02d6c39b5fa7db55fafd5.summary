attempting to tame one of the largest and most fearsome lizards in the world is no easy feat. but zoo keepers in @entity5 have managed to do just that with the help of a @entity9 camera to track the progress a 14 - year - old @entity12 dragon			1
the dragon , named @entity14 , is a meat - eating , fast - moving predator that can kill large prey with his deadly venom and razor - sharp teeth			1
despite its terrifying reputation , this komodo dragon often responds to its keepers call by waddling towards the targets			2
as @entity12 dragons spend most of their time resting in the sun , the training provides much - needed exercise for @entity14 throughout the day			1
and once he masters the trick , keepers can ask @entity14 to move into a different area of the exhibit			2
on target : the 9ft ( 2.7 metre ) creature has been taught to walk towards a series of yellow targets , getting a treat if he manages to complete the task successfully @entity54 : born at the @entity55 in 2000 , @entity14 arrived in @entity5 six years later and is now one of three @entity57 at the attraction komodo dragons , the world 's largest lizards , are found on the @entity63 island of @entity12			1
they have a stocky body , with bulky legs , scaly skin for camouflage and a long powerful tail			0
males can measure up to 10ft ( 3m ) in length and weight 176lbs ( 80kg )			0
they smell prey from a mile away and eat wild buffalo , pigs deer , snakes and fish			0
there are 6,000 komodo dragons in existence and only about 350 breeding females they eat mainly meat and can consume up to 80 per cent of its body weight at one time			0
a komodo dragon has about 60 sharp teeth to cut and tear flesh and can run as fast as humans			1
the training is also helpful if medical attention is needed , as @entity14 could voluntarily move without the need for sedation			2
footage from the @entity9 camera is currently being used to review the sessions and give an insight into how @entity14 sees his training			1
