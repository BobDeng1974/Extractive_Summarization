by political editor published : 06:34 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 16:37 est , 18 june 2013 multinational firms such as @entity2 and @entity3 would have to declare what tax they pay across the world under plans for a ' global standard ' to help put an end to tax avoidance			1
the @entity10 agreed that tax authorities ' should automatically share information to fight the scourge of tax evasion '			1
@entity15 is to lead the way by creating a central registry of information of who owns and controls companies , which the firms themselves will be required by law to declare			0
@entity10 and @entity31 leaders pictured left to right are @entity33 president @entity32 , @entity35 's prime minister @entity34 , @entity37 's chancellor @entity36 , @entity39 's president @entity38 , @entity15 's prime minister @entity40 , @entity42 president @entity41 , @entity44 's president @entity43 , @entity46 's prime minister @entity45 , @entity48 's prime minister @entity47 and @entity50 president @entity49 power : the leaders of some of the world 's most powerful nations have gathered in @entity56 for the two - day summit tax authorities and police will have access to the database and the government will consult on whether it should also be made public			1
the aim of the register is to stop wealthy individuals and corporations creating complex webs of offshore companies to try to dodge tax			2
@entity40 said the declaration would help ensure ' proper tax justice '			2
' [ it ] has the potential to rewrite the rules on tax and transparency for the benefit of countries right across the world , including the poorest countries in the world , ' he added			0
' we have commissioned a new international mechanism that will identify where multinational companies are earning their profits and paying their taxes so we can track and expose those who are n't paying their fair share			0
' friendly : @entity35 's prime minister @entity34 ( 2nd left ) touches hands with @entity39 's president @entity38 as they walk with @entity37 's chancellor @entity36 away from the photocall but the ten - point document , released after two days of talks at @entity29 , fell short of the demands of anti-poverty campaigners , who want the developing world included in the new arrangements from the start and have called for all countries to make tax information publicly available			1
one of mr @entity40 's advisers at the summit said @entity107 countries are losing twice as much in tax avoidance as they receive in foreign aid from the @entity110			1
@entity111 , spokesman for the if campaign on global hunger , said : ' today 's @entity10 tax deal is a step in the right direction , but it also leaves major unfinished business			1
' it 's progress that more tax authorities will know who owns phantom firms so they can crack down on them , but a summit focused on transparency ca n't justify keeping this information secret			2
' but @entity127 , @entity128 chief policy director , said : ' we 'd strongly oppose full country - by - country reporting in the future , which would risk swamping people in highly complex data , rather than improving transparency			2
' at the weekend @entity15 secured agreement from 10 of its overseas territories and crown dependencies , widely viewed as tax havens , to sign up to a new @entity142 standard on the exchange of tax information			0
meeting : the two - day summit agreed action on trade , and tax but divisions over @entity150 dominated the agenda talks : @entity15 prime minister @entity40 hailed the breakthrough on tax which he said would create global transparency on where firms are hiding profits divisions : @entity39 president @entity159 has been challenged by mr @entity40 and president @entity41 over his refusal to support arming opposition forces in @entity150 police : officers eat ice cream between advert posters showing mr @entity40 , mr @entity41 and mr @entity38 , at a petrol station close to the @entity10 protests : opponents of the @entity10 last night breached the security cordon around @entity29 wire : a small group of protestors broke through an outer fence security : there has been a significant police presence around the @entity10 site to ensure the protection of the world leaders inside @entity40 took advantage of the opportunity to have an outdoor swim before work today			1
the gathering of leaders from the world 's biggest economies is taking place in a luxury golfing resort on the banks of @entity29			1
the waters of the lake are temptingly visible from the conference rooms where the prime minister and his guests are discussing tax , trade and the civil war in @entity150			0
as the early - morning mists cleared to reveal sunny blue skies for the second day of the summit , mr @entity40 took a quick dip in the water before having his breakfast and joining his guests for the first working session of the day , on counter-terrorism			1
it was not immediately clear whether the other leaders , including @entity39 president @entity38 who is known for his taste for macho outdoor sports , also took to the water			0
chancellor @entity214 signalled that ‘ concrete steps ’ would be agreed at the @entity10 at @entity29 in @entity215			1
he warned that action was need on the ‘ rules about tax that have been in place for decades but , as the world has developed , have n't really kept up ’			0
he told @entity222 : ‘ as a result , individuals can hide the taxes they are supposed to pay in the international banking system and companies are able to shift their profits around the globe , away from where those profits are actually generated and therefore they do n't pay tax			0
‘ that 's really important because that is less money for our nhs and our schools and the things we need to invest in			0
’ he signalled that the plan being pushed at @entity10 was focussed on rewriting international rules that allow companies to shift their profits away from the @entity15 or any other country where they are doing business			0
a key feature of the proposals on the table at @entity29 is support for a new regime of exchange of tax information , so that countries will be able to know details of offshore accounts held by companies or individuals overseas			2
@entity15 is planning to take part in a pilot scheme later this year to trial the new rules ahead of the introduction of new @entity142 standards , and wants to sign up other countries			0
mr @entity40 also wants greater transparency about so - called ‘ beneficial ownership ’ to make clear who is the ultimate owner of a company and make it more difficult to operate ‘ shell companies ’ which often carry out no business activity , but exist only to hide the true source of income from tax authorities			1
@entity15 has often been seen as an international black sheep on tax havens , thanks to the practices in its overseas territories and crown dependencies like @entity282 , the @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 and the @entity286			0
but mr @entity214 said their agreement in @entity289 on saturday to accept the new @entity142 code showed the @entity15 was ‘ putting our house in order ’			0
meeting : mr @entity40 has been at pains to stress the informality of talks at the summit middle man : mr @entity40 found himself seated between mr @entity38 and mr @entity41 who last night staged an uneasy press conference where divisions over @entity150 were laid bare transparency : mr @entity40 has placed a heavy emphasis on securing a global agreement on cracking down on tax avoidance anti-poverty campaigners have welcomed mr @entity40 's decision to focus the @entity10 agenda during @entity15 's year - long presidency on tax transparency , arguing that it is the poorest countries in the world which lose out most from individuals and companies secreting their wealth in offshore boltholes			1
however , @entity317 , @entity318 executive director at development campaign group one , warned that any agreement on the exchange of tax information must include the developing world , and not just the rich nations of the @entity10			1
and he called for public registries of tax information , to allow investigations not only by tax authorities but also by campaign groups and the media			0
‘ the @entity10 must also ensure that the system they put in place for sharing tax information involves developing countries from the start , ’ said mr @entity317			1
‘ by taking these steps , the @entity10 will not only put its own house in order , but do so in ways that help the fight against extreme poverty			0
the @entity15 must continue to lead the way and lobby its @entity10 partners , with no let - up in pace or ambition			2
@entity10 leaders must decide whether they want to shape the transparency revolution or resist the tide of history			2
