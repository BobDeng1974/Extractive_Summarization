@entity0 chose not celebrate , nor did 60 or so travelling @entity2 fans who used to cherish his displays			1
but @entity4 very much cheered this emphatic victory that solidified their position in the play - offs and provided a needed tonic after recent headaches			1
@entity0 's reluctance to show joy when finding the net in some style against his former club was understandable			1
@entity2 is where he crafted his game and made his name between 2011 and 2014			2
since he left last year , initially on loan to @entity20 in january , there has been only despair on the seaside , and this defeat confirmed they would take the @entity26 wooden spoon			2
@entity4 celebrated an emphatic victory over @entity2 that kept their promotion push going @entity4 : @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ( @entity36 78 ) , @entity37 , @entity0 ( @entity38 74 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 68 ) , @entity41			1
subs not used : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			2
goals : @entity34 3 , @entity0 28 , @entity39 29 , ( pen ) 65			1
@entity2 : @entity49 , @entity50 ( @entity51 54 ) , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 69 )			0
subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67			0
referee : @entity69 ( @entity70 )			0
@entity4 , despite their recent troubles , can still look up			1
an easy win against the division 's worst team by far may not vouch for their play - off credentials but the three points help get them there			1
@entity80 , who may be heading to the @entity81 no matter what , was unable to field top scorer @entity83 because of a niggling hamstring injury			0
but his absence was not crucial , this was over by half - time			2
probably after just 2 minutes 29 seconds			0
that is when @entity34 picked the ball up off @entity35 in the middle of the pitch , strolled forward unchallenged and let fly a shot from 20 yards that bounced into corner of the net			1
deadlock broken , the rival fans united in trashing @entity2 chairman @entity97 , whose stewardship has sent the club into @entity100			0
' @entity101 , ' was a banner held aloft in the sparsely - populated away end			0
@entity34 celebrates after scoring the opening goal as early as the third minute @entity0 scored @entity4 's second goal of the night against his former side at the @entity107 chants were aired , ' @entity101 for @entity109 ' being one of the more printable			1
@entity0 's goal came in the 28th minute			1
he got the ball from @entity31 , danced into the area and curled a wonderful effort inside the far post			0
how important his eight goals have been since joining on loan from @entity118			0
@entity0 stayed composed out of respect to the club where he scored 31 goals in 100 league games			1
this , given all @entity2 's fans have suffered , was removing the salt from the wound			0
a mere 58 seconds later , it was 3 - 0			0
straight from kick - off @entity130 sent a backpass into the path of @entity39 , who finished cleanly			1
it meant he had scored in four consecutive league appearances for the first time since october 2009			2
he should have had a second seven minutes after the break			0
@entity41 picked out @entity0 , whose shot was saved by @entity140 , the ball rebounding back off @entity0 to bent six yards out			1
but the former @entity143 striker ballooned his shot high over the bar			0
he did double his tally in the 65th minute with a thumping penalty after @entity52 had fouled @entity31			2
it was his 12th goal in 15 games since arriving on loan from @entity151			0
@entity4 will need more of the same to reach the @entity81			2
for @entity2 , that dream has long faded			0
@entity39 celebrates after added a third goal for @entity4 inside the half - hour mark on tuesday @entity39 rifles a penalty into the top corner in the second half to add @entity4 's fourth goal and his second @entity2 's small contingent of travelling supporters make their feelings towards @entity97 known 18 april - @entity163 ( a ) 25 april - @entity164 ( a ) 2 may - @entity165 ( @entity166 ) 18 april - @entity167 ( @entity166 ) 25 april - @entity168 ( a ) 2 may - @entity163 ( @entity166 )			1

@entity4 keep their promotion hopes alive with easy win at @entity107
@entity34 gave them the lead in the third minute on tuesday
@entity0 scored against his former side , but did *n't* celebrate
@entity39 on target twice , *including* a penalty in the second half
