the married father - of - two also allegedly used the hospital pc to search for father - daughter sex tales during internet sessions			1

@entity1 was in charge of the radiography department at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , when a colleague ' stumbled upon ' the search terms in the browser history on the pc			1
he was identified as the prime suspect after it emerged he was the only person working in the radiography department at the time when computer records showed the searches were made between may 10 and may 18 last year			2
when he was quizzed in an internal @entity10 probe , @entity1 admitted searching for one unnamed @entity56 actress who runs her own lingerie line because he said he knew her personally			1
however , he denied he had searched for other inappropriate material on the pc just minutes later and described it as a ' coincidence ' , a disciplinary panel from the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) heard today , which went ahead in his absence			1
@entity64 , counsel for the @entity62 , said the searches took place on may 10 , 11 and 18 last year at the reception desk computer in the hospital ’s radiography department			2
the radiographer denied the claims and retired after 38 years of work following an internal investigation by hospital chiefs , who held him responsible for the searches , a disciplinary hearing was told today ' the inappropriate searches were stumbled upon by a colleague of the registrant ( @entity1 ) as they were searching on the computer in the reception area in the hospital , ' she said			1
' when searching in the search engine box , you put in a number of letters and an auto - fill function shows you previous searches			2
' when the colleague saw the list of previous searches , she was immediately concerned as to their content			0
' one that particularly concerned her was a search of a female that was known as an acquaintance of the registrant			2
' the panel was told that woman was an @entity56 actress who has her own underwear line			1
the married father - of - two also allegedly used the hospital pc at @entity42 to search for taboo father - daughter sex tales miss @entity64 said naked pictures of the actress were searched for by @entity1 on may 10 last year			1
twenty seconds later , this was followed by searches for ' naked celebrities ' , and ' @entity12 panties '			2
the following day , there was a search for ' @entity117 @entity116 50th birthday party upskirt '			2
there were also searches for ' naked celebrities ' , ' @entity122 ' , ' @entity14 birthday no panties ' , and ' @entity28 upskirt '			2
miss @entity64 continued that mr @entity1 made a number of searches for incest terms			1
searches were made for explicit shots of celebrities , including @entity28 she added : ' @entity131 documents were compared to the searches and the registrant was identified as the most likely staff member to be responsible			2
' those searches took place between 5pm and 5.30pm approaching the end of the day and towards after - hours			0
' miss @entity64 said @entity1 was interviewed about the searches by @entity139 , a senior pathologist at the @entity140 , during an internal inquiry in july last year			1
she said : ' he admitted he may have used the computer and he confirmed searching for female @entity143			0
' he denied searching for any of the other terms found on the search history - even though they were just minutes later - and said it was a coincidence only			0
' @entity1 claimed he had been ' set up ' by disgruntled staff ' and that everyone knew the generic log - in details for the computer and that the pc may even have been accessed remotely			1
he told mr @entity139 : ' yes , i ’ve heard of @entity14 but i ’m not into celebrities or anything to do with them			0
' giving evidence , mr @entity139 told the panel in @entity158 that he did not believe the experienced radiologist ’s side of the story			1
' the opinion i formed during the interview was that the registrant was lying to me , ' he said			0
@entity1 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity44 , retired after the @entity10 trust inquiry concluded that he had breached its computer use policies			1
he wrote a letter to the @entity62 panel today saying he had ' no intention of returning to work as a radiographer ' and therefore would not be attending to hear if was to be struck off			0
in her closing statement to the panel , miss @entity64 said : ' the circumstantial evidence , taken altogether , is persuasive			0
' you can see the pattern of searches and the timing of the searches with just seconds or minutes between them			0
' the registrant was the only man in the department accessing this computer			0
' it ’s a generalisation but it is more likely that a man would be searching and looking for these search terms than a woman			0
' in this scenario , i would suggest the search terms are inappropriate			0
they are not medically justified			0
' the only reason for these search terms is for personal pleasure or personal gratification			0
they are sexual in nature and not appropriate			0
' miss @entity64 said @entity1 ’s behaviour undermined public confidence in his profession			1
she added : ' whilst it may not trouble an ordinary member of the public to find out the registrant was doing this in his own time at home , it clearly damages the reputation of this individual as it was being done on work equipment			0
' it clearly raises questions about the registant ’s judgement , if nothing else			0
' the panel retired to consider its judgment this afternoon			0
it must decide if @entity1 is guilty of misconduct , and if so whether that impairs him to practice as a radiographer .			2
