by @entity0 published : 21:17 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 22:12 est , 16 february 2013 for almost 50 years , he has been the very soul of secrecy and reticence , refusing even to admit he was ever a member of the @entity5			2
but in the two weeks since @entity6 joined @entity7 , the @entity8 and former mp and @entity10 has developed an extreme case of @entity12 – too much information			1
his 75 tweets – an average of more than five a day – have a collective embarrassment factor that makes @entity18 ’s dossier redundant			1
twit pics : @entity6 ( pictured with a constituent named as @entity21 ) joined @entity7 two weeks ago and has already posted 75 times - an average of five a day so far his posts have revealed him to be an absent - minded ­ 64 - year - old who owns several teddy bears and takes his toothbrush into the @entity29 chamber instead of his pen			1
and he is in danger of being dubbed ‘ @entity32 lá ’ after letting slip that he takes his yellow rubber duck in to the bath with him			2
he has revealed musical tastes that extend from @entity38 to @entity39 to @entity40 and has admitted to being a ­ tree ­ ­ - hugger			1
his dramatis personae includes his favourite teddy bear , @entity44 ; a @entity45 called @entity46 who is a terrible driver ; and a trusted aide called @entity49			2
but @entity51 ’s most embarrassing foray into the @entity52 so far came last week when he admitted breaking into his own house			2
first the @entity54 told his followers at 4pm : ‘ @entity49 took the car			1
took my house keys also			2
i feel an adventure coming on			2
’ by 5.35 , @entity6 was still locked out			1
he was prepared to shin up the drainpipe but was frustrated by a broken pipe – a shinner clearly unwilling to jump without cast - iron guarantees			1
‘ @entity64 phone constantly engaged			2
wud climb in back window but downpipe broken , ’ he tweeted forlornly			0
a little later , @entity6 took matters into his own hands			1
he tweeted : ‘ @entity49 traced			0
where are u now when we need u ? 70 miles away			0
’ embarrassment factor : in his tweets , mr @entity6 mentions frequently his favourite teddy bear @entity44 ( right ) and his dog @entity79 ( left ) since then , it ’s all been down hill			1
under the name @entity82 he revealed : ‘ friday ! @entity84 getting home 2 c the small people in my life			2
’ included in the tweet was a link to a picture he had taken of four teddy bears of varying sizes , including a yellow one with an @entity94 badge on his chest			0
‘ @entity101 ’ , properly ‘ sásta ’ is one of the stock national - school @entity98 phrases that pepper mr @entity6 ’s tweets			1
embarrassingly , he had to be taught how to make a fada on @entity7 – and his first effort instead produced a @entity106 grave accent			1
‘ this twitting cud b addictive			0
and shud not b done under the influence			0
ah my first tweeted fada			0
@entity112 , ’ he crowed			0
on @entity114 , mr @entity6 wrote ; ‘ @entity116 au vin			1
pity i ’m on my ownieoh			0
’ proving popular : at the latest count , mr @entity6 had amassed more than 10,000 followers last week he wrote that he had accidentally brought his toothbrush into @entity123			1
thought i had a pen in my pocket			0
discovered it is a tooth brush ! silly me ! ! ! ! ’ on february 9 , he wrote that he had seen some unusual natural behaviour while on an early morning bike ride			0
‘ saw the dawn breaking			0
saw a squirrel chasing a cat			0
so is cat , ’ he observed			0
party officials confirmed the account is his , and say the tweets show a side of @entity6 they often see in their dealings with him			1
‘ he is far more relaxed in private , ’ said a @entity146 td			0
‘ during the years of the peace process , it was a sensitive process and as the leader of @entity146 he had to be conscious of people ’s feelings			0
it was a serious business and it did n’t look good to be laughing and joking all the time			0
’ at the latest count , mr @entity6 had amassed more than 10,000 followers			1
as for the 30 tweets being followed by mr @entity6 , let ’s hope they are not of a nervous disposition .			1
