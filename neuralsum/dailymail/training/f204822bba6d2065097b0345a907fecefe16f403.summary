by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today admitted voters are ‘ frustrated ’ at the pace of action to tackle immigration into @entity7			0
the prime minister said voters wanted the government to go further and faster in curbing the numbers of people arriving in the @entity7			1
it comes as ministers prepare for figures – to be released on the day of the @entity16 elections - which are expected to show net migration from within the @entity18 has overtaken arrivals from the rest of the world			1
figures from the @entity23 show how net migration among people from elsewhere in @entity16 is on course to overtake those from outside the @entity18 mr @entity2 has promised to reduce net migration – the difference between the numbers arriving and those leaving – to less than 100,000 by 2015			1
but after falling in the early days of the coalition it has started to rise again , fuelled by growing numbers of people arriving from the rest of @entity16			0
@entity36 has stepped up pressure on the government with an aggressive campaign , warning the government can do nothing about the issue while @entity7 remains in the @entity18			1
@entity36 leader @entity43 has boasted that he will trigger a ‘ political earthquake ’ by winning the @entity45 elections on may 22 , pushing the @entity46 into third			1
now it has emerged that within weeks new figures will show how net migration from within the @entity18 is responsible for the majority of the population rise linked to immigration			1
in the year to september net migration stood at 212,000 , which the @entity23 said was a ‘ statistically significant increase ’ from 154,000 in the previous year			2
@entity2 claimed support for @entity43 's @entity36 was fuelled by public frustration by the pace of progress in tackling immmigration more detailed figures show that net migration of @entity18 citizens almost doubled to 131,000 from 65,000 the previous year			1
an estimated 209,000 citizens from the rest of the @entity18 arrived in the @entity7 , the highest since records began in 1964			2
at the same time only 78,000 left			0
it means that net migration from within the @entity18 stood at 131,000 , just 10,000 lower than the figure for @entity72 migrants			1
just two years ago the gap was more than 150,000			0
the figures expose how government action to tackle immigration is hindered by @entity18 freedom of movement laws			2
while rules have been tightened for people from outside the @entity18 , little can be done for @entity18 nationals			2
mr @entity2 admitted the issue has left voters frustrated , which was part of the rason for the surge in support for @entity36			0
he told @entity87 : ‘ i think there are lots of things happening here			0
first of all we ’ve been through a very painful and difficult recession that has caused damage to families right up and down our country , we ’re recovering from that , we ’ve got more people in work , people are seeing our economy turn round , but it takes time and people feel frustrated by that			0
‘ added to that , you ’ve got issues like immigration , like reform of welfare , where i would argue this government has made huge progress , but people would like us to go further and faster and they ’re frustrated by that			0

prime minister says government failing to keep up with public expectations
@entity36 on course to win @entity45 elections on may 22
