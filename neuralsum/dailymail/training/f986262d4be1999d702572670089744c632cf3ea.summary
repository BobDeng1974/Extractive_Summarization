by @entity0 , @entity1 world number one @entity2 barely worked up a good sweat on another sizzling day at the @entity5 as he strolled past @entity6 6 - 1 6 - 3 6 - 0 and into the third round of the year 's final grand slam on thursday			1
djokovic , who has reached the @entity11 final each of the last four years and won it all in 2011 , needed just 88 minutes to dismiss the veteran @entity12 on a gusty @entity14 court			1
the @entity16 champion broke @entity6 to open the match and never eased off the gas as he swept through the last seven games to clinch an emphatic win			1
no sweat : @entity22 1 @entity2 had little trouble dispatching @entity6 at the @entity5 ' i have nothing to complain about , i wanted to get my job done as quick as possible , ' said @entity2			1
' i do n't feel like i need to play long matches to get into the groove			2
' i mean , i feel that i 'm hitting the ball very well			2
second match even better than the first one			2
' under the circumstances i think i came up with a very good performance			2
stayed mentally tough and did not allow myself to get frustrated because of the wind and conditions that were obviously very tough for both of us			2
' it has been a smooth start to @entity5 for @entity2 , who opened his campaign with an equally dominant display as he eased past @entity43 @entity42 in straight sets poor : @entity6 was beaten for the loss of just four games in the second round at @entity11 but things should get tougher in the third round where the @entity50 will run into big - hitting @entity52 @entity51 , who advanced with a 6 - 3 6 - 4 6 - 4 win over 28th seed @entity54 of @entity56			1
' it 's logical to expect that every next match that you play in a grand slam will get tougher , ' said @entity2			1
' @entity51 is playing in front of his crowd			1
i 'm sure that he 's going to have some good support			0
' but on the other hand , if we get to play on centre court , maybe night session , that 's where my experience kicks in , i think			0
' i have had a lot of matches , night sessions if we get to play , as i said , and ( i will ) try to neutralise his serve that is his big weapon			0
if he serves well , he 's very dangerous			0
' @entity2 , who had won only two matches in the hard court run - up to @entity11 after getting married just days after his @entity16 triumph , has looked like his old dominating self			1
playing his first grand slam as a married man , @entity2 , who is also about to become a first - time father , had talked about a shift in priorities but underscored that he is still fully focused on the task at hand when he steps onto the court			1
home from home : @entity50 star @entity2 has reached the last four finals at the @entity5 ' my focus is there			1
i do n't understand how the people really got what i said , but i do n't think there is anything wrong , ' said @entity2			2
' actually , i think it would be much ( more ) wrong if my tennis is in front of my baby and my wife			0
' i think there is no question about it			0
my full priorities and commitments and energy go to my family as much as i need to , but that does n't mean that i 'm not going to play tournaments or not going to continue on doing what i was doing so far			0
' of course i 'm doing everything that i can , respecting the same daily routines that i had for many years with my team and it 's working well			0
i have big support from my wife , from my family , from my team			0
we are all on the same page			0
