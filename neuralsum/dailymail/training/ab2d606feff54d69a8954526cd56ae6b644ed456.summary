just a day after the @entity3 chose to bypass a spy for their top position because of her waterboarding past , the name of the man they chose instead was leaked on @entity7 despite his still being undercover			1
the government is remaining mum , but @entity10 is likely the next spy chosen to head the @entity3 ’s @entity11			1
‘ new head of # @entity3 clandestine service was head of # @entity15 since ca 2011			0
@entity16 , 57 , ’ tweeted former @entity18 assistant editor @entity17 on wednesday			0
leaked : the name of the man chosen as top @entity3 spy was leaked on @entity7 wednesday , though he remains undercover as the agency chief in @entity22 the leak was likely related to a report tuesday that the post would be filled by the head of the @entity3 's @entity27 , a former station chief in @entity29 who former officials said once ran the covert action that helped remove @entity33 president @entity32 from power			1
the top spy job was originally supposed to go to one of the agency ’s highest - ranking women , an agent identified only as @entity40 but cries rang out over ‘ @entity49 ’ heavy involvement with a secret @entity3 prison in @entity44 where high - profile terrorist suspects were subjected to so - called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding and sleep deprivation			1
the officer briefly ran a secret @entity3 prison where accused terrorists @entity53 and @entity54 were waterboarded in 2002 , according to current and former @entity56 intelligence officials			2
report : former @entity18 reporter @entity17 tweeted that the next head spy will be @entity10 , and @entity59 ( pictured ) of and @entity60 quickly confirmed she was also a senior manager in the @entity61 helping run operations in the war on terror and served as chief of staff to @entity66 and helped carry out his order that the @entity3 destroy its waterboarding videos			1
that order prompted a lengthy @entity71 investigation that ended without charges			0
shortly after @entity17 ’ tweet , reports @entity74 , longtime intelligence reporter @entity59 confirmed @entity10 ’s pick in @entity60 , in a report that also supports the claim that ‘ g ’ was passed over for her interrogation ties			2
‘ most likely @entity10 was chosen because there 's not a whiff of scandal in his background , as far as we know , ’ @entity59 wrote			0
‘ " @entity88 " is a word that comes to mind			0
’ the @entity3 , while announcing @entity49 ’s bypassing , denied it was the veteran spy ’s waterboarding past led to the decision			2
‘ the assertion she was not chosen because of her affiliation with the ( counter terrorism ) mission is absolutely not true , ’ said @entity3 spokeswoman @entity93			0
urged : the @entity100 's @entity99 reportedly asked the @entity3 not to appoint a previous pick , named ' g , ' because of ties to torture professional : the @entity3 maintains director @entity105 , pictured , chose @entity10 over @entity49 for reasons apart from @entity49 's ' counter terrorism ' ties meanwhile , sen. @entity99 , the @entity100 's top @entity109 , has criticized the interrogation program and personally urged cia director @entity105 not to promote @entity49 , according to a former senior intelligence briefed on the call			1
more than a decade after it last used waterboarding , an interrogation technique that simulates drowning , the @entity3 is still hounded by the legacy of a tactic that the @entity56 government regarded as torture before the @entity121 administration authorized its use against terrorist suspects			0
@entity105 's ties to the interrogation program delayed for years his nomination to lead the @entity3 and @entity99 wants the agency to declassify a 6,000 - page report on the interrogation program			0
government officials have neither confirmed nor denied @entity10 's appointment .			1

@entity133 is reportedly the next @entity3 head honcho as previous pick , a woman called only ' g , ' was *labelled* too *controversial* for her waterboarding past
government officials have not confirmed the next leader of the @entity3 's @entity11 will be @entity10 , currently head spy in @entity22 , because his identity is still supposed to be a secret
