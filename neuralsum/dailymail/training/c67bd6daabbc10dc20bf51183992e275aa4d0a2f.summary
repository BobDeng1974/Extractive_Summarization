by @entity0 a man is suing the legal team behind his failed @entity4 compensation bid - alleging the lawyers pursued a ' hopeless ' claim while making millions in legal aid			1
@entity8 , 23 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , developed autism three years after being injected with the vaccine			1
however , the claim was subsequently dropped after flawed research suggesting there was a link between the jab and autism was discredited			1
he and his family are now taking legal action against @entity23 solicitors saying the case they raised was issued out of time , raised false hopes and had no chance of succeeding			1
a man is suing his former legal team from @entity31 , pictured , for pursuing a ' hopeless ' mmr compensation bid			1
he says the firm 's lawyers issued the claim out of time and raised false hopes of his family receiving payment mr @entity8 also alleges the firm litigated ' a hopeless claim funded by legal aid ' by which they profited			1
the family are expected to ask for £ 50,000 in compensation , it was reported today			0
the firm - which was established by sir @entity47 , the late husband of @entity49 mp @entity48 - denies it was negligent			2
according to his current firm , mr @entity8 is the first to instruct action - but they have been in contact with several other families believing they too are entitled to compensation			1
thousands of families had instructed legal action following @entity60 's 1998 research claiming there was a link between mmr and autism came to light			1
however , by 2001 concerns over the research had surfaced - with the doctor resigning from the @entity68 that year saying his ' research was unpopular			0
' by 2003 , the research , which was published in @entity71 , was widely discredited			0
as legal aid was subsequently withdrawn , a majority of claims were dropped			1
@entity60 was eventually struck off the @entity75 in 2010			0
the group action is thought to have raised a £ 15 million legal aid bill - £ 9.7 million of which is believed to have gone to solicitors and barristers			1
@entity81 , mr @entity8 's lawyer of @entity83 solicitors in @entity84 , said today : ' serious professional obligations rest on both solicitors and counsel who act in legally - aided cases to ensure that the @entity89 is kept informed of the state of the case , and that unmeritorious cases do not continue to receive support			1
' litigation and legal liability depend on evidence - not belief , assumption , hope , or wishful thinking			2
' there has not been peer reviewed published evidence to support the hypothesis that @entity4 vaccine causes autism - the published evidence refutes the link			1
' the @entity4 litigation has cost millions in legal aid for lawyers and experts - but not a penny has been obtained in compensation for any claimant			1
' mr @entity8 is seeking damages to ' include compensation , distress , expense and inconvenience of engaging in hopeless litigation			1
' the firm was part set up by @entity123 - the late husband of @entity49 mp @entity48 ( both pictured ) the firm denies it was negligent in the issuing of proceedings or the timing of the case			2
a spokesperson for @entity23 said : ' the suggestion that @entity23 would knowingly run a hopeless case is nonsense and completely contrary to our principles and ethics			1
' the @entity4 case was typical of many group litigation cases which were funded by legal aid at that time			1
allegations were made that the @entity4 vaccine caused autism and other conditions			1
the link was supported by dr @entity60 who was the expert retained on the case			0
' in such cases where the merits of the case were not clear cut , the @entity89 would typically fund the case for generic investigations to be carried out by specialist solicitors ( and members of the @entity154 panel ) subject to approved cost limits and regular reports on progress			2
' legal aid was therefore granted for the @entity4 case to be investigated			1
the certificate was initially granted to @entity160 of @entity161			0
the conducting solicitor @entity162 moved to our firm in april 1998 and the certificate was transferred to @entity23			1
' @entity162 then moved on to @entity165 and the @entity4 certificate was transferred to them in june 1999			2
we had no further role in the generic investigations after this date			0
eventually , the @entity89 decided to withdraw funding			0
firm evidence on causation was not forthcoming and the cost risks were considered to be too high			2
you will be aware that @entity60 was discredited and eventually struck off by the @entity175			0
' in the case of @entity8 , we issued proceedings to protect his claim as there is a 10 year limitation period			1
this is a normal precaution			0
we do not accept that the case was issued out of time			0
however , whether or not it was issued out time is irrelevant as it was eventually decided that the case could not be sustained due to lack of causation evidence and funding was withdrawn			0
thousands of families had their compensation bids stopped after research by @entity60 , pictured , suggesting a link between @entity4 and autism , was discredited ' no new evidence has come to light since which supports any link between the @entity4 vaccine and autism			1
therefore , mr @entity8 has not lost the chance of winning compensation for the administration of the vaccine , because we now know that the claim could not succeed			1
' to suggest that we took legal aid funds to investigate the case knowing it was hopeless in 1998 and 1999 is completely untrue			1
at the time , the merits of the case were not clear			0
a link between the vaccine and autism was strongly asserted by the families and dr @entity60 and in view of the large number of cases and the seriousness of the condition , it was right for investigations to be carried out			2
the @entity89 were happy to fund these investigations			0
' today , mr @entity8 's mother @entity223 described how her son is now ' severely autistic ' and lives life to a strictly regimented routine			2
the 56 - year - old said the family had been put under an immense amount of stress after discovering they may not get compensation			0
she said : ' it has been really , really stressful and to find out that even if it had been successful we might not have got compensation			0
' finding out @entity8 had autism was really hard - we were just devastated			1
but getting a diagnosis was a relief , i felt like it was my fault			0
' we put our trust in those lawyers , that they were going to do the right thing and we put our life into their hands			0
' they made us think there was a case to fight and that we could win , there were so many people who joined the action , they made us think we stood a chance			2
' it was a hard time and i want justice for @entity8 , he was a happy healthy baby and then his life suddenly changed			2
' i ca n't work because i 'm @entity8 's carer , after he left school he went to stay in a transition placement - they did n't want him to come home because they felt he was used to being in that environment			2
' but it was really hard having my child away from me - it broke my heart			0
he eventually came home after he was hurt by another service user , it was really hard for me			0
i would walk down to work everyday and burst into tears			0
' and it 's hard because i know i wo n't be here forever and that is one of my biggest worries - what happens to him when i 'm not here			0
' in 1998 , a medical paper was published in @entity71			0
in it , it was claimed that colitis and autism spectrum disorders could be caused by the combined measles , mumps and rubella ( @entity4 ) vaccine			1
the research led to a significant drop in young people getting the vaccine - leading to an increase in all three medical conditions			0
according to statistics released by the @entity297 , the percentage of @entity4 uptake in the @entity295 fell from 88.3 per cent in 1998 to a low of 79.9 per cent in 2003			2
group action - called the @entity300 - had its status as group action granted in 1999			2
six years later , in 2007 , the high court judge @entity304 stopped the group action following the withdrawal of legal aid by the legal services commission			1
all but two claims were discontinued			0
a pressure group called @entity310 ( justice , @entity312 , @entity313 ) was established to represent families wishing to pursue compensation			1
£ 15 million in public legal aid funding was spent on the litigation , of which £ 9.7 million went to solicitors and barristers , and £ 4.3 million to expert witnesses			1
in following years , numerous troubling facts were revealed about the investigation			2
the @entity324 reported that @entity60 had manipulated figures and had several conflicts of interest in the research			0
it was in part retracted in 2004 - with a full retraction instated in 2010			0
@entity60 was also struck off the medical register that year .			0
