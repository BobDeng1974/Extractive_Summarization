' secret stuff ' : @entity1 , 62 , is a part therapist and part acting coach , known as the ' celebrity whisperer ' she is known as the ' celebrity whisperer ' , a woman whose astonishing skill in honing @entity10 talent made an icon out of a man who used to stand on street corners dressed as a chicken			1
today , @entity15 is known the world over			1
@entity1 's client list includes @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and many others			1
so powerful are her methods , she reduced @entity25 to tears within five minutes			1
and within months , the singer was topping the charts with @entity29			2

she hosts workshops around the globe , as well as in the wood - panelled library of her £ 3 million home			2
@entity25 went to @entity32 when she was about to play legendary soul singer @entity39 in the movie @entity41 and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist			1
despite her professional success , @entity25 was also at what she termed ' a pivotal point ' in her life			1
' i 'm about empowering people , ' @entity1 told @entity49 in a rare interview – one which goes much further into her methods , and her clients ' responses , than she usually allows			1
' @entity25 is a black girl from the @entity55 , that is her world			1
like everyone else on the planet , she has issues			2
but once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art , she flourished			2
' apparently it 's all about the ' secret stuff ' that @entity66 's clients tell her			1
certainly it is well known that @entity25 's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years			1
' i told her to open up , to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her , ' @entity1 said			1
' she started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional			0
she tapped into that well of pain inside her			0
' she rang me up after we 'd worked together on the movie and said , ' listen to my new record – it 's all the stuff you taught me			2
' and that 's when she came out with @entity29 and all the great female empowerment songs			2
the little pop star turned into a global icon			0
' when we meet at @entity1 's home , model and actress @entity18 is just leaving after a three - hour ' intensive session ' for her new movie with @entity93 called special correspondents			1
clients : @entity1 works with some of the biggest names in show business including @entity25 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) @entity18 's @entity99 dress in pale orange shop the designer at @entity102 ! visit site @entity104 ! we love it			1
and we 've a feeling little @entity104 might be a little style icon in the making , just like her mum			0
so what that in mind , it 's time to revisit one of our favourite @entity18 looks			1
this woman can wear what she likes			0
even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless , which is why we 've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look			0
she wore this orange @entity99 dress back in march of 2013 , but we still ca n't quite get over it			0
it 's floaty , feminine and gorgeous			2
@entity18 teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe , which added another texture and dimension to the look			1
we would definitely suggest a strappy , metallic heel with this			0
so , if you 're keen to update her look for the new season , check out our pick of the best colour - popping dresses ( below )			0
we 'll be donning @entity140 's layered mini dress with a leather biker jacket to see out the summer in style			2
@entity143 visit site boohoo @entity145 visit site @entity147 ( now on sale for $ 178 ! ) at @entity149 visit site @entity151 at @entity152 visit site so what did that amount to ? @entity156 said : ' @entity1 's technique could be boiled down to : take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it			1
' in other words , your guess is as good as mine			0
@entity156 continues : ' it helps you understand humanity – what drives someone to do what they do , good or bad			0
it 's not painful … it 's cathartic			2
' @entity1 first met @entity15 when he was working as a promoter for a fast - food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit , and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting			1
today , he is still a client and @entity1 worked on his most recent movie , @entity182			1
she made an icon out of @entity15 , who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast - food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit ' @entity15 always had a work ethic that put others to shame , ' @entity1 said			1
' he studied and worked			0
i would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because @entity15 wanted to rehearse a scene three , four , five hours a day			1
he was dedicated to his craft			0
he had no social life			0
he had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me			0
' for the major talents , fame is never the driving force			0
@entity15 worked his butt off , he 's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder			1
he makes bold choices and is n't afraid to fail			0
' so what is the secret ? @entity1 says her technique is based on delving into your ' deepest , darkest past ' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen			1
some of this is outlined in a best - selling book @entity216 ( @entity217 ) which has been translated into 18 languages			0
stars such as @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity156 have given the tome glowing reviews			0
@entity156 said : ' it is my bible – i do n't leave home without it			0
' @entity1 recently returned from a working trip to @entity231 and says the phenomenon of @entity234 actors dominating @entity10 ( @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 ) is ' because @entity238 have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves '			2
do her celebrity friends such as @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 ever expect star treatment ? ' bottom line is they are with me to work , ' @entity1 says			1
' celebrity goes out the window			2
i 'm about stripping them bare			0
the one thing i have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings			0
' it does n't matter if you are in @entity231 or the @entity260			0
there 's a shared human story – we all want love , we all have issues with our spouses or partners , with our parents			2
the key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim			0
' you have to use that stuff to empower yourself			0
