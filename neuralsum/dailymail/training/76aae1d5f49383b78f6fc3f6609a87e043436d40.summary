by @entity0 and @entity1 when two prisoners decided to stage a rooftop protest on a hot day , it was only a matter of time before health and safety became an issue			0

it now houses 659 inmates mr @entity23 said : ‘ they should n’t have been up there in the first place			0
' in next two or three weeks , when we hit the hotter part of the summer , it is only going to encourage other inmates to get up there on the roofs and expect suncream and sun block – and possibly cold drinks and ice creams			2

' safety first : the @entity16 has now launched a review into the suncream incident on june 19 defending the situation , the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) said the offer of sun lotion was a means of negotiation to get the prisoners to come down from what appeared to be a protest			1
