six @entity1 residents have filed a federal lawsuit against governor @entity3 , the state of @entity1 , the @entity5 and @entity1 , and others over traffic jams in september that made them ' late for work			1

lawyer @entity18 says she filed it after learning this week that lane closures on an approach to the @entity22 were ' deliberate actions			1
his spokesman did not respond to an email seeking comment			2
the news comes after a woman who died after her ambulance was delayed due to the road closures enacted by @entity3 's political aides was identified as a 91 - year - old mother - of - two who moved to @entity46 from @entity47 for a better life			1
@entity49 had a heart attack at her home in @entity14 , @entity1 , on september 9 last year but her ambulance took seven minutes to get there because of the gridlock			1

mrs @entity49 's daughter @entity60 , 57 , told the @entity61 : ' i honestly believe it was just her time			2
' we want to stay out of it			0
' @entity1 circus : @entity3 fended off questions about his management on thursday , taking responsibility for the bridgegate episode but blaming specific staffers who have now been fired but angry friends neighbors have have expressed their outrage that her care may have been compromised in any way for what appears to have been an act of revenge on one of @entity3 ’s political opponents			1

it is not clear if the delay in the ambulance arriving contributed to the death of mrs @entity49 , a widow whose husband died five years ago			0
on thursday , @entity3 said he was ' heartbroken and humiliated ' as he apologized for his staff 's ' callous ' conduct leading to the ' @entity25 ' controversy that will either dampen his hopes at a run for the @entity96 or strengthen his image as a no - nonsense executive who places a premium on accountability			1
the @entity102 's inquiry follows several other probes launched after the so - called @entity25 scandal , in which operatives loyal to @entity3 's administration are accused of causing traffic jams on the @entity22 in september in retribution for a @entity1 mayor not endorsing @entity3 's re-election @entity3 revealed at a two - hour press conference that he has fired @entity113 , the deputy chief of staff who conspired to block vehicle lanes to the @entity22 , snarling traffic and delivering a political blow to a @entity1 mayor who refused to back the governor 's re-election bid			1
