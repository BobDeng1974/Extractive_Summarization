someone else was being dragged in as well as the school to this fraudulent project			0
' there were no sufficient funds in the account and there was a risk that the cheques would be cashed making the school account go overdrawn			0
' @entity63 may be a fraudster and a plausible man but he was doing work at your house			1
you must have known that the last thing you were entitled to do was to use school funds to try to help him			0
' this was a repeated and persistent breach of a high degree of trust			1
the school account never had much in it but that did not stop you from trying to access them with varying degrees of success through your own selfish needs because of your feelings for a man who told you he needed money			0
