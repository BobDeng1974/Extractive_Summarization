@entity0 is lobbying for the art of yodelling to be given @entity3 status			1
the form of @entity6 singing , which has existed since the 1830s , would be added to the @entity3 alongside @entity8 and the @entity9 , if the status is granted			1
the request comes after the @entity13 tango was named a @entity3 tradition in 2009			1
falconry and the @entity17 diet have also been added to the list			2
the @entity0 government has now asked for eight ‘ intangible heritage ’ traditions to be added to the prestigious list , @entity33 reported			2
as well as yodelling , the @entity0 have asked for , among others , mechanical watchmaking and managing the risk of avalanches to be given official status			0
but they may have to wait eight years for the status to be granted as under current rules countries can only submit one ‘ intangible heritage ’ entry each year			0
status : the form of @entity6 singing would be added to the @entity3 alongside @entity8 ( left ) and the @entity9 ( right ) , if the status is granted the yodel is a song sung with an extended note which rapidly and repeatedly changes in pitch and makes a high - low - high - low sound			1
developed in the @entity59 as a method of communication between mountaineers or between villages , the yodel later became part of the region 's traditional lore and musical expression			0
most westerners of a certain age know it purely through a version of a song warbled by @entity73 in the classic @entity76 - set musical @entity74 .			0

song sung with extended note rapidly and repeatedly changing in pitch
