@entity0 believes @entity1 are the favourites to win the @entity3 because they will be able to handle the conditions the better than any other team			1
@entity7 's side are going in search of their sixth @entity3 and will have the advantage of playing at home			1
and former @entity11 keeper @entity0 , who won 130 caps for his country , says @entity1 are the team to beat			1
close shave : @entity0 believes @entity15 , @entity16 and the rest of the @entity1 squad have the best chance going all the way : with players like @entity22 and @entity23 , @entity1 have emerged as favourites @entity0 told @entity25 : ' i think @entity1 are clear favourites because of the weather , the humidity , the warmth , the expectation from the people			1
' and besides , there are so many good football players that they can put two or three teams in the @entity3			1
so i think it will be very hard for an outsider , or maybe a @entity41 team , to get to the final and try to win it			2
i think @entity1 will win for the sixth time			1
' but when it comes to individual star , the @entity48 @entity47 keeper is in no doubt who will shine , he added : ' my friend @entity53			1
i played a couple times against him in 2006 and 2008			2
we always lost and i think it is fair to say that @entity57 could well be top scorer of the tournament			2
' @entity0 has also tipped @entity60 's @entity59 to have a long and successful career ahead of him â€“ despite suffering difficulties earlier this season when he was dropped by @entity64 earlier in the season			1
@entity0 added : ' i think sometimes it is not bad to have a period that you are making mistakes and maybe you are on the bench for a couple of games			2
shinning star : @entity53 is tipped to be the stand out player by @entity0 tipped for the top : @entity0 is expecting big things from @entity53 ' maybe that helps to bring back your focus and the desire and the will			1
i think the second part of the season , he really performed at the level that he is capable of			0
' the save that comes in my mind is the one he did against @entity88 for @entity64			0
' those are the saves that you want to make and shows that you are ready for business			0
hopefully the pressure of the nation is not going to be too much on him			0
turning it around : @entity59 can be one of the best keepers in the world ' he is 27			1
i was 28 when i went to @entity99 ; i was 30 when i came to @entity100 and i was 34 when i went to @entity47			2
' so , it is a long path that you have to go			0
hopefully he has a long career , and normally as a goalkeeper , you keep getting better and better by the games you play			0
' i think the little dip he had at beginning of the season he was not meant to have			0
hopefully you get the right captain and the right motivation and right hunger and desire back			0
' of course i made mistakes also and everybody makes mistakes			0
you need to learn from them			0
