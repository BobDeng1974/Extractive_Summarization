by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 11:12 est , 11 january 2013 many people intending to get fit this year will have already seen their resolution crumble as the effort to actually get to the gym proves as exhausting as a workout itself			1
but help is at hand in the form of the irrepressible 80s @entity11 legend mr @entity10 who has come up with a way for people to get fit quick in the comfort of their own homes			2
with the assistance of @entity20 , the fitness guru has created a series of two minute workout videos - one of which you can view below - which can be done every morning in the time it takes to cook your breakfast porridge in the microwave			1
she said : ' i 'm not a gym bunny , i do n't have time and i find the gym a bit boring			1
but i ca n't use the excuse that i ca n't get to the gym with this workout because you can do it in your kitchen			1
' it 's free and a good way to kick start your day			2
you can even do it in your pyjamas before you have a shower and get dressed			2
' specialist equipment not needed : water bottles can double as weights the 38 - year - old , who is mother to daughter @entity66 , aged two , said she finds gym workouts too time consuming			1
' i 've always tried to keep fit , especially since i became a mum , ' she admitted as she teamed up with mr @entity10 for the campaign for @entity71			2
' but going to the gym can take half the day by the time you 've got there , worked out , showered and changed afterwards			1
' i try to incorporate fitness into my daily routine instead			2
for example , i power walk up a steep hill with the pram when i take @entity66 to nursery rather than driving			2
' the tv presenter admitted she needed to be in shape for her stint on @entity36 - and the upcoming arena tour - because of the skimpy costumes she has to wear			1
working up a thirst : mr @entity10 said the workouts are perfect to do before breakfast ' i felt really exposed in the @entity91 costume because it was cut away , ' she said			0
' i 'm pushing 40 , standing against @entity93 who is 23 ! my legs are quite toned from exercising but i did n't want to show off my stomach			0
' now thanks to her training for @entity36 , she admitted she 's the fittest - but also the most exhausted - she 's ever been			1
as she does n't have a nanny , her and husband @entity98 had to juggle care of @entity66 around her @entity36 training and his work commitments			0
@entity20 said while she enjoyed every minute of @entity36 , she had ' mother 's guilt ' for the time it took her away from her little girl			1
now she has more free time again , @entity20 said the two - minute exercises are a great way for her to spend time with @entity66 while also teaching her about the benefits of exercise			1
mr @entity10 - real name @entity10 - agrees it 's important for both young and old people to keep fit , and his two minute workouts are a great way for people to begin			2
revealing : @entity20 said she 's glad she 's currently in shape given the skimpy outfits she had to wear in @entity36 he said : ' two minutes is no time at all			1
it wo n't get you super fit but it will give you a start and that could be the start to a new you			0
' if you can do two minutes of exercise that you have never done before , you 'll feel great about that and then you 'll want to build upon it			0
' he said it 's important to make exercise a habit and then it will become as second nature as personal hygiene			0
' when people ask me if i have days when i do n't want to exercise , i ask them , " do you have days when you do n't want to brush your teeth ? "			0
' if i went out and forgot to brush my teeth , i would n't feel same , i 'd have to go and buy a toothbrush or some chewing gum			0
and until i brush my teeth , i do n't feel right			0
it 's the same with exercise if you get into that zone and make it second nature			0
' mr @entity10 said his ' message from 20 years ago is still the same - let 's get moving ' , but admits they ' have n't re-invented the wheel ' with the two - minute routines			1
' there 's burpies , star bursts , press up and sits ups , it 's about keeping the intensity for 30 seconds without specialist equipment , ' he said			0
he added that he loved working with @entity20			1
if i was n't married and she was n't married , we could become an item ! ' he joked			0
' she picked it up quite easily which goes to show you can do it even if you have n't done this kind of exercise before			0
' mr @entity10 & @entity20 are supporting @entity71 's @entity170 campaign to super start your morning in the time it takes to cook your porridge			1
to see their fun , 2 minute hit routines which you can try at home , go to @entity176			0
