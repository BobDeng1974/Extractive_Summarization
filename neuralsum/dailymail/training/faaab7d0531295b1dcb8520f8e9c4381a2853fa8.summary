what is it ? hypothermia occurs when a person 's body temperature drops below 35 ° @entity193 ) ; normal body temperature is around 37 ° @entity195 )			1
when the body gets cold it , tries to prevent losing more heat by shivering ( which keeps the major organs at normal temperature ) , restricting blood flow to the skin and releasing hormones to generate heat			0
but these responses use up energy and may not be enough to maintain body temperature if it is exposed to the cold for a long time			0
when the body runs out of energy , it gradually begins to shut down			0
shivering stops and the heartbeat begins to slow			0
what causes it ? as well as being caused by cold and windy weather - and not wearing enough warm clothing - there are other factors that can trigger or exacerbate it			2
getting wet is a major factor as water conducts heat away from the body 25 times faster than air			2
drinking alcohol is another major contributor , says @entity230 , head of first aid education at the @entity233 @entity232			0
' alcohol widens the blood vessels , so more blood - and therefore heat - goes to the surface of the skin and is lost from the body			2

' if someone is hypothermic , they may appear confused , disorientated and irritated			0
