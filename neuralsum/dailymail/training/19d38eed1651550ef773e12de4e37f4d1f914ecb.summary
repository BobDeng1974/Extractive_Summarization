by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 07:57 est , 9 october 2013 missing : @entity1 was last seen in a flat in the @entity3 in may 2007 and is the subject of a global police search police have identified a new suspect in the disappearance of @entity1 and are set to release an ' e-fit ' photograph of him , it was claimed today			1
officials apparently hope the photograph will enable them to track the man down , more than six years after @entity15 went missing from a flat in the @entity18 resort of @entity19			1
@entity20 reported that the picture is set to be released by the @entity7 , which has taken over the investigation into the girl 's disappearance from @entity18 police			1
the man was apparently seen near the flat around the time that @entity15 , then aged three , disappeared while her parents @entity29 and @entity30 were dining at a nearby restaurant in may 2007			1
@entity32 today refused to confirm or deny the claims , saying that it was planning ' a series of public appeals ' in a variety of countries			0
a police statement said : ' we are not prepared to discuss , comment or speculate on the content of the upcoming appeal in relation to the investigation into the disappearance of @entity1			0
' this has been weeks in the planning and each element of the investigation must be set into the overall context of the appeal			0
' we will be asking for help from the public in a number of countries , delivered through a series of public appeals			0
' we will do nothing to jeopardise the effectiveness of these appeals and we have repeatedly stated that media speculation can be damaging to our efforts			0
' the @entity7 will release the relevant material at the relevant time			2
' parents : @entity29 and @entity64 are currently suing a disgraced @entity18 police chief the image will be released within a few days and will form part of the new push to find @entity15 , according to @entity20			1
the possible breakthrough has apparently been warmly received by the @entity70 , who are confident that the search for their daughter is progressing			0
however , police are currently unsure how the man might be connected to the case and are appealing for more witnesses to come forward			0
@entity80 detectives launched a fresh investigation in july this year - two years into a review of the case - and a @entity85 appeal on the case is to be aired on monday			0
the appeal will include a reconstruction of the ' latest , most detailed understanding ' of the events around the time @entity15 went missing			1
aged : this image of how @entity15 might look now was released by police last year @entity32 has revealed a comprehensive record log of mobile phone traffic could be the key to finding out what happened to the girl			1
@entity15 's parents have said they remain ' optimistic ' of finding their daughter and will not accept she is dead until they are presented with clear evidence			2
the @entity7 now has a team of six @entity18 detectives based in @entity101 who are carrying out inquiries on its behalf			2
several e-fits of possible suspects have emerged since @entity15 's disappearance - including one , dubbed the ' egg with hair ' , which sparked ridicule because of its lack of facial features			2
police refused to release the picture to the public , citing strict @entity18 laws covering investigations , but those who saw it were convinced that it was completely useless			0
in january 2008 the @entity70 ' team released an artist 's impression of an olive - skinned man with straggly , collar - length hair and a drooping moustache based on a statement given by a @entity80 holidaymaker			2
court case : @entity64 pictured in @entity131 outside the libel trial of former police chief @entity133 in july 2008 @entity18 authorities shelved their investigation into @entity15 's disappearance , and the next month thousands of pages from the official police files were released			1
the documents included computer - generated e-fits of two suspicious men seen around @entity19 before @entity15 went missing which were never made public by detectives			1
the @entity70 are currently suing former @entity18 police chief @entity133 for libel after he claimed that they were responsible for their daughter 's disappearance			0
both @entity29 and @entity64 have asked to give evidence in the trial in @entity131 over the policeman 's book , @entity151			0
the couple say @entity133 's allegations that they hid @entity15 's body after she died in an accident , then faked her abduction , damaged the hunt for the girl and exacerbated their grief .			1

e-fit photograph of man ' will be released to public within a few days '
he is reported to have been seen near the flat where @entity15 vanished
@entity7 has recently launched a new effort to find missing girl
