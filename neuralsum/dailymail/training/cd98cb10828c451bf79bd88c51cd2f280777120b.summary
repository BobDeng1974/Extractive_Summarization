@entity0 made @entity1 pay for his @entity3 omission with a superb man - of - the - match performance that keeps @entity5 on course for a place in the @entity8			1
@entity1 's rising star @entity9 got the nod for the hooking role in the @entity3 ahead of the @entity13 regular , who demonstrated all his old skill with two early tries and an all - round industrious display to which @entity1 had no answer			1
it was routine for @entity19 , who were presented with the @entity21 before kick - off , as they moved effortlessly to within 80 minutes of a return to @entity24 with a clinical 41 - 0 victory at @entity26			2
@entity0 scores the second try for @entity5 in the @entity3 play - off against @entity1 @entity5 ' seven - try triumph - in which @entity3 winger @entity29 scored on his 100th appearance - earned them next week off and they will also get the chance to select their home semi-final opponents via the controversial @entity37 system			1
@entity1 , who missed the chance to pip @entity19 to top spot by losing to @entity40 in their final league game , will have another chance to reach the last four in next week 's elimination semi-finals but - like @entity44 after the first qualifying play - off - will need to find a vastly improvement if they are get back on course for a maiden @entity8 appearance			2
@entity1 coach @entity50 responded to their mini-slump by dropping stand - off @entity53 , one of the stars of the season , in favour of @entity57 while @entity59 winger @entity58 made an unexpected return in place of the injured @entity62			0
@entity19 coach @entity63 also sprung a surprise by switching second rower @entity65 to scrum - half			2
he acquitted himself well but it was @entity0 who the star of the show			0
@entity9 began the match on the bench - with @entity74 preferred as the @entity1 ' starting hooker - and entered the action midway through the first half moments after @entity0 had broken the deadlock by forcing his way over for the game 's first try			1
five minutes later @entity0 repeated the feat , this time from 10 metres out , and @entity83 kicked his second conversion to make it 12 - 0			0
saints let slip a 10 - 0 lead in their last match but they soaked up @entity1 pressure to keep their line intact up to the break and increased their advantage of the stroke of half - time with a drop goal from @entity96			0
any hope of a @entity1 fightback was snuffed out within five minutes of the restart when @entity0 worked a run - around with @entity101 to free @entity96 , who sprinted 50 metres for @entity19 ' third try			1
@entity0 then became trysaver when he managed to get his leg in the way to prevent @entity1 centre @entity105 touching down after a rare breach of the @entity19 defence			2
trailing 19 - 0 , the visitors were forced to chance their arm and it cost them another try when @entity5 winger @entity112 , a replacement for the injured @entity114 , picked up a loose ball and went 70 metres for a solo score			0
the home side were denied a penalty try when skipper @entity119 was pulled back while chasing @entity0 's grubber kick to the line but @entity1 captain @entity122 was sin - binned for the offence and @entity19 took advantage of the extra man to increase their lead			1
@entity29 took @entity83 's pass to cross at the corner and , as the @entity1 began to tire , front - row forwards @entity127 and @entity129 both demonstrated brute strength to force their way over for close - range tries			0
@entity83 took his goal tally to six from seven attempts to wrap up a convincing victory .			0

man - of - the - match performance from @entity0 helps @entity19 to victory
@entity142 @entity9 scored two early tries for the hosts
saints will get the chance to select their home semi-final opponents
