warning : @entity0 said today that @entity2 forces must withdraw from @entity3 as quickly as possible before any more troops are killed it is ' crystal clear ' the war in @entity3 is completely lost and is not worth wasting the life of one more @entity2 soldier , @entity0 has said today			1
in the 11 - year - conflict 438 @entity2 have died and the former @entity11 leader believes that our armed forces should ' get out now ' to avoid any more bloodshed			1
the prime minister wants to withdraw the 9,000 @entity2 troops by the end of 2014 as long as it fits with @entity19 's own plans			1
but @entity0 says it should be much sooner saying ' the longer it takes , the greater the sacrifice ' as more deaths are not in battle , they are at the hands of members of the @entity3 police or army			1
despite being trained by allied forces traitors have killed 14 @entity2 soldiers and 47 others so far this year			1
' it is now crystal clear that we have lost in @entity3 , ' @entity0 wrote in the @entity36 today , adding : ' it is not worth wasting one more life in @entity3			1
' what can be done to stop @entity3 internally unravelling into chaos has already been done			0
the only outcome of staying longer is more deaths for no purpose ; most of them now caused not by the enemy in front of our troops , but by the enemy among them			2
' the fourteen @entity2 troops who have been killed by their @entity3 allies this year account for almost one in three of all fatalities in the country , which is 61			1
the latest murder involved a @entity58 officer who was shot dead by an @entity3 soldier as he played in a @entity61 football match			0
dangerous : @entity63 patrl in @entity3 but more and more soldiers are being killed by insiders rather than in battle captain @entity68 , 41 , from the @entity69 , @entity67 , was killed at @entity70 in the @entity73 - e @entity72 district			2
capt @entity68 , from @entity74 , was shot when the traitor opened fire with an @entity78 assault rifle as @entity2 and @entity3 forces took part in the kickabout			1
the @entity82 also confirmed that two troops shot dead last month – female @entity58 medic corporal @entity84 , 25 , and corporal @entity86 , 27 , a @entity63 – were also killed by a renegade @entity3 policeman			2
a @entity58 commander also warned last month that the threat from inside will continue to increase			0
tragic : captain @entity68 , 41 , ( pictured with his son @entity90 ) who was shot dead by a rogue member of the @entity3 army as he played in a football match on @entity61 mourning : @entity68 is carried at @entity95 airbase - and is one of 14 @entity2 who have died in this way this year brigadier @entity98 says a proportion of @entity3 forces will always be unreliable , leading to calls that they should be better vetted			1
@entity0 says there is nothing that can be achieved in the war - torn country now			0
' all that we can achieve has now been achieved , ' @entity0 wrote			2
' all that we might have achieved if we had done things differently has been lost			0
the only rational policy is to leave quickly , in good order and in the company of our allies			0
this is the only cause for which further lives should be risked			0
' we have succeeded in only one thing ; albeit the big thing we first said we went to war for — driving out @entity118			0
in almost all the other tasks we set ourselves , especially the establishment of a sustainable state , we have failed			0
' message : prime minister @entity123 eats breakfast at @entity125 and has been told to pull out now not next year to avoid more bloodshed			0

' it is now crystal clear that we have lost in @entity3 , ' he said
14 @entity2 troops have been murdered this year by @entity3 police or army they helped train
