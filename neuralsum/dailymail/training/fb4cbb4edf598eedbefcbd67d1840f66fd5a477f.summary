by @entity0 published : 21:21 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 04:28 est , 14 february 2013 the successful search for the skeleton of @entity3 has prompted calls for a fresh bid to locate the remains of another major historical figure buried in @entity8			1
cardinal @entity9 is known to have been buried at the city 's abbey in 1530 , but his bones have remained undiscovered			1
the churchman , @entity14 's lord chancellor , died at the abbey while travelling to @entity16 after being accused of treason when he failed to secure the annulment of the king 's marriage to his first wife @entity21			1
@entity22 : the bones of @entity14 's lord chancellor cardinal @entity9 remain undiscovered at the time of his death @entity9 was arguably @entity28 's second most powerful person after the king			1
the ruined abbey can be seen in @entity31 close to the city centre			0
confirmation last week that a skeleton found under a council car park in @entity8 in september , last year made the city the focus of media attention worldwide			2
the remains of @entity3 were found under a council car park in @entity8 in september last year a stunning find : the remains of @entity3 ( pictured ) were found in a hastily dug grave beneath a council car park in @entity8 last september , in what were once the precincts of @entity47 church the @entity48 : @entity3 , pictured on the white horse , was killed in battle more than 500 years ago at @entity48 , in a battle which marked the end of his line and the rise of the @entity55			2
@entity9 served as royal chaplain to @entity57 , who seized the throne @entity9 ( 1473 - 1530 ) was arguably the most powerful figure during the first half of @entity14 's reign			1
he came from a relatively humble background and rose to become royal chaplain under @entity57 in 1507			0
two years later , the king died and was replaced by his son @entity14 , who took a hands - off approach to governing which allowed the likes of @entity9 to build up unprecedented power			1
after sidelining most of his rivals , @entity9 was appointed archbishop of york in 1514 and lord chancellor the next year , propelling him almost to the very top of the hierarchy in both the secular and religious spheres			2
he was also made a cardinal , cementing his position as the most powerful man in @entity28 after - or perhaps even including - the king himself			0
as well as his political achievements , @entity9 left a very visible legacy in the form of his great home at @entity86 and the foundation of @entity88 - originally known as @entity88			2
but his downfall came after @entity14 , who was desperate to end his marriage to @entity21 in order to wed @entity92 , tasked him with seeking an annulment from the @entity94			2
when the annulment was not granted the king blamed @entity9 , seized his property and accused him of treason			0
the great cardinal died in @entity8 on the way to his trial in @entity16			0
city councillor @entity101 said : ' the discovery of @entity3 is wonderful news , yet there remains something of a mystery about what happened to @entity9 , who rivaled @entity14 in wealth and power and was one of the most significant political figures of the era			1
' arguably , he is far more influential than @entity3 to discover his remains would help tell the story of another historic figure linked to the city			0
' ' there have been digs over the years to try to find him but they have not succeeded			0
i would like another go			0
' it would bring more tourists to the city and further excite the interest in history and archeology that we are now seeing			0
' @entity9 served as royal chaplain to @entity57 , who seized the throne after @entity3 was killed at the @entity48 in 1485			0
it is likely he was buried with great ceremony at the abbey but historians think his tomb was destroyed later in @entity14 's reign , when abbeys were dissolved in the late 1530s after @entity28 's split with the @entity141			1
attempts to locate @entity9 's remains during digs in 1820 and again in the 1930s drew blanks			1
however , @entity148 chairman @entity147 said : ' his bones may have been scattered and any remnants destroyed , but for years they said that about @entity3 ' i think it would be marvellous to have another look			0
' it was a great fluke that @entity3 was found but we know @entity9 was buried in the @entity156 of the abbey church , which is not all that big			1

@entity159 is known to have also been buried in @entity8 's abbey in 1530
historians think his tomb was destroyed later in @entity14 's reign
attempts to locate @entity9 's remains in 1820 and the 1930s drew blanks
