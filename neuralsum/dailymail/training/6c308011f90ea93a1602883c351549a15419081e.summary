scientists have developed a new microscope that can image living things in @entity4 , ten to 100 times faster than existing technologies			1
the system could be used to capture remarkable details , such as single cells in the zebrafish heart while it is beating , the researchers say			1
dubbed ' scape ' , the technology can also help unlock the secrets of brain activity by monitoring neurons as they fire in real - time			1
scientists have developed a new microscope that can image living things in @entity4 , ten to 100 times faster than existing technologies			2
dubbed ' scape ' , the technology can also help unlock the secrets of brain activity by monitoring neurons as they fire in real - time ( pictured ) the microscope was developed by @entity26 , associate professor of biomedical engineering at @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , ' with @entity13 , we can now image complex , living things , such as neurons firing in the rodent brain … this has not been possible until now , ' said professor @entity26			1
while conventional light - sheet microscopes use two awkwardly positioned lenses , professor @entity26 realised that she could use a single lens , and then that she could sweep the light sheet to generate 3d images without moving the objective or the sample			1
' this combination makes scape both fast and very simple to use , as well as surprisingly inexpensive , ' she said			0
' we think it will be transformative in bringing the ability to capture high - speed @entity4 cellular activity to a wide range of living samples			2
' imaging techniques that can capture these dizzying dynamic processes , such as neurons firing in the brain , have lagged behind other breakthroughs			1
time can be crucial when diagnosing illness			0
and with conditions such as cancer , the current method of testing samples of tissue for disease - a biopsy - can be a slow process , with an anxious wait for results			0
the procedure can cause discomfort and pain			0
furthermore , it often has to be repeated , as the sampling is not always accurate			0
now , scientists have developed the world 's smallest microscope - the size of a pin - which is inserted into the body , allowing doctors to ' see ' cancer and make an instant , precise diagnosis , saving the patient from the need for a biopsy			1
it is already being used for pancreatic cancer , a disease with a poor prognosis as it 's often detected late , and scientists are now looking at using it for colon , bladder , oesophageal and lung cancer			0
the endomicroscope was developed in @entity95 and is so powerful it can see individual cells and the blood vessels that run between them			2
professor @entity26 has already used the system to observe firing in @entity4 neurons trees in layers of the mouse brain			1
in small organisms , including zebrafish larvae , @entity43 can see through the entire organism			0
by tracking these tiny , unrestrained creatures in @entity4 at high speeds , the microscope can capture both cellular structure and function and behaviour			2
' it was n't until we built it that we realized it was a light - sheet microscope , ' said professor @entity26			1
' it took us a while to realize how versatile the imaging geometry was , how simple and inexpensive the layout was — and just how many problems we had overcome			0
' next - generation versions of scape are in development that will deliver even better speed , resolution , sensitivity , and penetration depth			0
' deciphering the functions of brain and mind demands improved methods for visualizing , monitoring , and manipulating the activity of neural circuits in natural settings , ' says @entity137 , co-director of the @entity138 and @entity139			0
' @entity26 's sophistication in optical physics has led her to develop a new imaging technique that permits large - scale detection of neuronal firing in three - dimensional brain tissues			1
' this methodological advance offers the potential to unlock the secrets of brain activity in ways barely imaginable a few years ago			2

dubbed ' scape ' , the technology can help unlock the secrets of brain
it does this by *rapidly* monitoring neurons as they fire in real - time
