by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:48 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:15 est , 16 december 2013 @entity4 's latest advertising campaign , titled ' shhhhut down fat talk ' and spearheaded by model @entity6 , has been deemed ' ironic ' and ' insincere ' by critics			1
the low calorie cereal brand calls for women to embrace their bodies and stop ' joking about cankles ' , ' muffin tops ' and ' cellulite '			1
however , one woman wrote on @entity16 in response to the new initiative : ' @entity4 is about fighting @entity19 not ' fat talk			1
' another added : ' so @entity4 is telling us we are fat and need to lose weight , but to stop saying it to ourselves ? are you ladies buying this ? ' as part of the new campaign , @entity4 invited several women to a store that contained labels inscribed with things like ' feeling so disgusted at my figure at the moment # cow , ' ' cellulite is in my dna , ' and ' i have a muffin top ' in place of display signs and price tags			1
' @entity4 promotes weight loss and then promotes not concerning yourself with your weight			2
it 's ironic to me ' the ladies ' reactions were caught on camera and combined into a short advert uploaded to @entity62 on december 2			2
' this is like looking at the inside of my head , ' ' i feel sad ' and ' it 's like bullying yourself ' were among the comments provided by the volunteer shoppers			0
the advert 's closing caption reads : ' you would n't talk this way to anyone else , so why do it to yourself ? let 's shhhhut down fat talk			1
' stop focusing on the negative : the cereal brand 's aim is to get women loving their bodies alarming statistics : it claims that 93per cent of women engage in fat talk and many do it at least once a week horrified : shoppers who saw the @entity4 store labels said that they could relate to what was inscribed on them and it was like ' looking inside their mind ' one viewer of the @entity4 advert said she thinks it sends a ' good message ' and she was ' touched ' when she watched it but was distracted by the irony			1
she continued : ' does n't @entity4 advertise their product as a way to lose weight ? the ' special k challenge '			0
' they promote weight loss and then promote not concerning yourself with your weight			2
it 's ironic to me			0
' a week after news of @entity4 's ' shhhhut down fat talk ' campaign broke , its ambassador , @entity6 , posted a ' selfie ' to @entity115 and @entity116 asking others to get on board			1
the 40 - year - old model , who has spoken openly about her own weight and self - esteem issues in the past , appears pulling a ' silent pose ' with her finger pressed to her mouth			0
feel good ambassador : a week after news of @entity4 's '' shhhhut down fat talk ' campaign broke , @entity6 posted this ' selfie ' to @entity115 and @entity116 asking others to get on board she captioned the image : ' it ’s time 2 strut through life w / extra boom boom pow			1
# @entity138 w / me & @entity4 by posting @entity141 selfie ! [ sic ] ' in a press release she added : ' i know firsthand how much criticizing your body negatively affects self - esteem , but as a role model , i try to maintain a positive attitude and healthy approach to managing my weight , ' as a guy whose girlfriend is constantly negative about her appearance , wholeheartedly support this campaign ' ' that ’s why i ’m excited to partner with @entity4 to help empower women to not only feel confident about their bodies , but also to remove those negative thoughts and show them how to employ tips and tricks to make their least liked physical attributes look better			2
while some have questioned the authenticity of the campaign 's message , hundreds of supporters have followed @entity169 ' lead			2
indeed , @entity116 is awash with women recreating her ' selfie ' pose including @entity174 news anchor , @entity173			0
weight loss properties : @entity4 prides itself on being low fat and low calorie ironic : @entity4 is known for its weight loss challenges - and adverts featuring slender models and it 's not just women supporting the initiate			1
one man wrote , ' i fight with my girl about this all the time ! ' and another added ' as a guy whose girlfriend is constantly negative about her appearance , wholeheartedly support this campaign			0
' according to @entity4 , 93per cent of women admit to engaging in fat talk and 63per cent say they do it at least once a week			1
stints of self - depreciation were most likely to occur in front of the mirror , during a girls ’ night with friend and while out clothes shopping			0
forty one per cent of those aged between 18 and 34 said it ’s also triggered by looking at photos of other women			0
@entity4 is working hard to promote a healthy body image			0
last year it ditched its slender models for the first time in 25 years in favour of plus - sized ‘ real ’ women .			0

the brand 's ' shhhhut down fat talk ' initiative is spearheaded by *supermodel* @entity6
a short @entity62 clip demonstrates how women *punish* themselves for having ' muffin tops ' and ' cellulite '
but one viewer said : ' i 'm not feeling authenticity from a brand dedicated to encouraging women to do ineffective deprivation diets and weight loss '
