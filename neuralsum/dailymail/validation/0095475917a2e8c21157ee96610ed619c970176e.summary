this weekend 's @entity1 action unsurprisingly brought up a number of talking points			0
here , @entity5 's @entity4 talks us through the key events from @entity9 's @entity1 quarter - final draw with @entity10 on sunday			1
@entity11 was well served by not giving decisions at @entity13 , where there were four decent penalty appeals			1
while one could make a case — certainly technically — for three of the four to be given , i felt @entity11 got every one of those decisions right			0
@entity9 ’s best chance of a penalty was their first appeal when @entity22 went down under pressure from @entity24			2
@entity9 attacker @entity22 ( right ) was denied a penalty after tumbling from a challenge by @entity24 @entity22 ca n't believe it after referee @entity11 waves away his protests while slow - motion replays perhaps indicated that @entity24 may not have played the ball , he certainly appeared to from all angles at full speed			1
the other two appeals in the first half were for handball and both were accidental			0
@entity10 defender @entity24 ( left ) also made contract with @entity39 in the box during the second half early in the second half , @entity39 felt @entity24 ’s arm make contact so he went to ground , knowing he was n’t going to reach the pass played for him			2
once again , @entity11 was right to allow play to continue , understanding that not every contact is a foul .			0

@entity9 drew 0 - 0 against @entity10 in their @entity1 quarter - final tie at @entity13 on sunday
there were four decent penalty appeals during the game
referee @entity11 got every one of them correct
the two handballs in the first half were accidental and @entity24 played the ball despite @entity22 going down under the challenge
@entity24 made contact with @entity39 in the box , but @entity11 was also right to wave play on as the former knew he was n't going to get the ball
