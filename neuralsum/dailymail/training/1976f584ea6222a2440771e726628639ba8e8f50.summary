nearly 70 years after the holocaust , there is no more sensitive an issue in @entity4 life as the role of @entity6			1
with fewer than 200,000 @entity6 among @entity4 's 82 million people , few @entity4 born after @entity7 know any jews or much about them			1
to help educate postwar generations , an exhibit at the @entity11 in @entity12 features a @entity11 man or woman seated inside a glass box for two hours a day through august to answer visitors ' questions about @entity6 and @entity11 life			1
the base of the box asks : ' are there still @entity6 in @entity4 ? ' mixed reaction : visitors surround @entity26 @entity25 , the first person to act as the ' @entity6 in a box ' at the exhibition ' @entity30 - everything you always wanted to know about @entity6 ' at the @entity11 ' a lot of our visitors do n't know any jews and have questions they want to ask , ' museum official @entity32 said			1
' with this exhibition we offer an opportunity for those people to know more about @entity6 and @entity11 life			1
' but not everybody thinks putting a @entity6 on display is the best way to build understanding and mutual respect			2
since the exhibit @entity30 , everything you wanted to know about @entity6 opened this month , the ' @entity50 , ' as it is popularly known , has drawn sharp criticism within the jewish community - especially in the city where the @entity54 orchestrated the slaughter of 6 million @entity6 until @entity57 's defeat in 1945			1
' why do n't they give him a banana and a glass of water , turn up the heat and make the @entity6 feel really cosy in his glass box , ' prominent @entity12 jewish community figure @entity58 told @entity66			1
' they actually asked me if i wanted to participate			0
but i told them i 'm not available			0
' challenging stereotypes : a visitor voting on what people think about @entity6 at the museum in @entity12 the exhibit is reminiscent of @entity77 architect @entity76 sitting in a glass booth at the 1961 trial in @entity26 which led to his execution			1
and it 's certainly more provocative than @entity83 actress @entity82 sleeping in a glass box at a recent performance at the @entity86 in @entity87			0
@entity88 , an @entity26 who has lived in @entity12 for years , was horrified by the idea of presenting a @entity6 as a museum piece , even if to answer @entity4 ' questions about @entity11 life			1
' it 's a horrible thing to do - completely degrading and not helpful , ' he said			0
' the @entity11 absolutely missed the point if they wanted to do anything to improve the relations between @entity4 and @entity6			1
' but several of the volunteers , including both @entity4 jews and @entity26 living in @entity12 , said the experience in the box is little different from what they go through as @entity6 living in the country that produced the @entity54			1
controversial : hats are displayed under the question ' how you can recognize a jew ? '			2
the exhibition will run until september ' with so few of us , you almost inevitably feel like an exhibition piece , ' volunteer @entity110 said			0
' once you 've been ' outed ' as a jew , you always have to be the expert and answer all questions regarding anything related to religion , @entity26 , the @entity77 and so on			0
' museum curator @entity120 , who is @entity11 , believes the exhibit 's provocative ' in your face ' approach is the best way to overcome the emotional barriers and deal with a subject that remains painful for both jews and non-jews			1
' we wanted to provoke , that 's true , and some people may find the show outrageous or objectionable , ' @entity120 said			2
' but that 's fine by us			0
' the provocative style is evident in other parts of the special exhibition , including some that openly raise many stereotypes of @entity6 widespread not only in @entity4 but elsewhere in @entity140			1
learning about @entity141 : @entity142 , the first person acting as the ' jew in a glass box ' , will be followed daily by a @entity11 man or woman who will sit inside a glass box for two hours a day to answer questions one includes a placard that asks ' how you recognize a @entity6 ? ' it 's next to an assortment of yarmulkes , black hats and women 's hair covers hanging from the ceiling on thin threads			1
another asks if @entity6 consider themselves the chosen people			1
it includes a poem by @entity11 author @entity163 : ' how odd of @entity164 to choose the @entity6			1
but how on earth could we refuse ? ' yet another invites visitors to express their opinion to such questions as ' are @entity6 particularly good looking , influential , intelligent , animal loving or business savvy ? ' despite the criticisms , the ' @entity50 ' has proven a big hit among visitors			1
troubled history : part of the @entity11 's role is to educate the public about the @entity77			2
here two survivors @entity181 , left , and @entity182 are being shown around			0
' i asked him about the feelings he has for his country and what he thinks about the conflict with @entity189 , if he ever visited @entity189 , ' visitor @entity183 said			0
' i have @entity11 roots and i 've been to @entity189 and realized how difficult it was there			2
i could not even mention that i have @entity11 roots			2
' on a recent day this week , several visitors kept returning to ask questions of @entity194 , a 33 - year - old @entity26 seated on a white bench with a pink cushion			0
one woman wanted to know what to bring her hosts for a @entity201 dinner in @entity26			0
another asked why only @entity11 men and not women wear yarmulkes			2
a third inquired about @entity206 and homosexuality			2
' i guess i should ask you about the relationship between @entity4 and @entity6 , ' visitor @entity210 said to @entity142			2
' we @entity4 have so many insecurities when it comes to @entity6			0
' @entity215 - @entity214 , 53 , asked if @entity142 felt welcome as a jew living among @entity4 ' considering our past and all that			0
' heritage : the @entity11 in @entity12 is intended to promote understanding of the @entity4 jewish community yes , @entity142 said , @entity4 is a good place to live , even as a jew			1
but the country could do even more to come to terms with its @entity226 past , he added			0
he advised the would - be traveler that anything is permissible to bring to a @entity201 dinner as long as it 's not pork			0
' i feel a bit like an animal in the zoo , but in reality that 's what it 's like being a @entity6 in @entity4 , ' @entity142 said			0
' you are a very interesting object to most people here			0
' @entity242 , one of the volunteers in the glass box , said many @entity4 have an image of @entity6 that is far removed from the reality of contemporary @entity11 life			1
' they associate @entity6 with the @entity77 and the @entity226 era , ' he said			0
' @entity6 do n't have a history before or after			0
' in @entity4 , @entity6 have been stereotyped as victims			0
it is important that people here get to know @entity6 to see that @entity6 are alive and that we have individual histories			1
i hope that this exhibit can help			0
' still , not everyone believes this is the best way to promote understanding			0
rabbi @entity260 from the @entity11 @entity262 community in @entity12 said @entity4 who are really interested in @entity6 and @entity206 should visit the community 's educational center			1
' here @entity6 will be happy to answer questions without sitting in a glass box , ' he said .			2
