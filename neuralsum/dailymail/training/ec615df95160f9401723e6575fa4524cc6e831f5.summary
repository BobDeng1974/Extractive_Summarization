the @entity0 has proven to be extremely good at recognising the human body			0
only last week , a group of @entity4 researchers used the sensor to create a device that can translate sign language			2
now one writer has discovered that @entity0 can see human anatomy far better than first thought			0
perhaps , a bit too well			0
mr @entity13 noted that the @entity0 hardware / software was so effective at distinguishing the bumps and folds of clothing that it could pinpoint a man ’s package			1
he made the discovery while testing @entity33 's new and improved @entity0 sensor which is due to come out on 22 november			1
@entity33 unveiled its new @entity0 sensor as part of its @entity37 event in june			2
the sensor will be sold with the new console and both are available from 22 november			2
it can read up to six skeletons at once , compared to the current two , and its ' small object detection ' is said to be two - and - a - half times better			2
the second - generation kinect sensor is also able to see faces , track eye movements and detect expressions			1
it is additionally said to be better at recognising features and body movements in the dark and dimly lit rooms because it uses what 's called active infrared ( @entity55 )			0
@entity55 works in a similar way to thermal imaging and is used in night - vision goggles , for example			0
as well as the heart rate monitor , @entity33 's sensor has an increased ' field of view ' that is now 60 per cent wider than the current @entity0			1
the new sensor is also able to see faces , track eye movements and detect expressions			0
it is additionally said to be better at recognising features and body movements in the dark and dimly lit rooms because it uses what 's called active infrared ( @entity55 )			0
the filming in the above video was done on the @entity0 ’s topographical view , which is accessible to all gamers but not often used			1
‘ the new @entity0 certainly is n’t malevolent ; it ’s just engineering that works a bit too well , and is sharing that a half step more socially than we might want it to be , ’ said mr @entity13			1
mr @entity13 said that it raises the question of whether @entity37 should be censoring some of its images			1
‘ i ’ve learned one thing in 31 years of masculinity , it ’s that nobody ever wants to see my placket - racket flopping around in the living room , ’ he added			1

the sensor *highlights* a man 's package when it is in topographical mode
it was spotted by @entity13 of @entity20 when testing the sensor
