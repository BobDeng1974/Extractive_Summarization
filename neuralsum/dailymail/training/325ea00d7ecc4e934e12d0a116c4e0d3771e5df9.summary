@entity0 believes that @entity1 is ' not normal ' , as the striker ’s blistering introduction to @entity5 football showed no sign of abating with a hat - trick against @entity8			1
the 25 - year - old was superb on saturday as the @entity10 dealt with an early scare from @entity13 's impressive side to hold on to their impeccable @entity15 record			1
it means that @entity1 now has a remarkable seven goals in four league games since his £ 32million move from @entity20 in the summer and further enhances the belief that @entity22 came out of the transfer window as clear victors			1
@entity1 now has more league goals than @entity40 managed in the entire of last term			0
‘ if the team plays well he has to score goals			0
seven in four is maybe too much , ’ the manager said after the 4 - 2 win			1
‘ it is something that is not normal			0
we can not expect that after eight matches he will have 14 goals			0
‘ he is comfortable in the team			0
the team was built in a way that we were waiting for a certain type of striker and i think now everybody knows that @entity22 did the right thing in waiting for him and not going into the market in the summer of 2013 or january			1
‘ we waited for the right one			0
’ sitting top of the @entity15 , the picture looks rosy for @entity22 , who saw both @entity67 and @entity68 drop points earlier in the day			1
they are already five points clear of last season ’s champions although @entity0 is wary of tricky fixtures straight after @entity75 ties in the coming months			2
@entity1 's first goal of the afternoon leveled the scores against @entity8 and the 25 - year - old looked delighted as he netted his second to put @entity22 2 - 1 up @entity8 keeper @entity80 could do nothing as @entity1 netted @entity22 's third and his hat - trick ‘ we have fixtures that are like a poisoned gift for us , because every time we play in the @entity89 the next match is against @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity90 or @entity91			1
we have difficult weeks ahead of us			0
’ wednesday ’s home @entity89 game against @entity94 kicks @entity22 off in continental competition , with @entity0 insistent @entity96 is as tough as they come			1
@entity22 will also come up against @entity97 and @entity98 and hope @entity99 will be fit for the opener			2
‘ the group is more difficult than people think , ’ he added			0
‘ the @entity104 league is not strong , but the top three teams are very good			0
you go to @entity22 ’s history and see when we played against @entity109 it was difficult and against @entity111			2
‘ when we play sporting it will be difficult			0
the @entity113 are @entity113 - @entity94 have improved a lot on last season			2
’ @entity116 replaced @entity1 in the second half to net on his @entity22 debut and @entity120 was influential again as he assisted the first two goals of @entity1 's hat - trick			1

costa scores *fantastic* hat - trick as @entity22 beat @entity8 4 - 2
@entity0 delighted with the impact of his forward following his arrival
he has scoring seven times in four @entity15 games so far
@entity8 took the lead at @entity134 but eventually fell to *defeat*
