from the outside it looks like the grim skeletal remains of a once magical castle , but in fact this deserted @entity5 replica of @entity6 never opened its doors			1
what was meant to be ‘ the largest amusement park in @entity13 ’ , had construction cut short over a decade ago after funding was withdrawn			1
and now the ruins of ‘ wonderland ’ sit in the middle of a 100 - acre corn field , just a 45 minute drive from the centre of @entity20			2
@entity22 ruins : the abandoned building in the shape of a castle stands uncompleted in a field in what would have been an amusement park called ' wonderland ' , on the outskirts of @entity20 work on the potential tourist haven started in 1998 but was halted due to disagreements over property prices with farmers and the local government			1
now the farmers that used to own the land have returned to grow their crops once again , with the decaying building site filling the skyline			2
photographer @entity43 visited the magical kingdom - turned - ghost park and said : ‘ pulling off the express - way and into the car park , i expected to be stopped by the usual confrontational security guards			0
sitting in a corn crop : local farmers have returned to the land they once owned to start growing corn again after developers deserted the project a look inside : a view of abandoned buildings that were to be part of the amusement park ‘ but there was absolutely no one to be seen			0
i walked through one of the few entrances not boarded up , and instantly started coughing			0
‘ in front of me were large empty rooms and discarded furniture , all covered in a thick layer of dust , along with an eerie silence that gave the place a haunted feeling – an emotion not normally associated with a children ’s playground			0
’ local farmers told the photographer that they have returned to use the land because they say its safe to think the developers are never coming back			0
‘ this i can believe ’ , added @entity43 on his blog , ‘ as the absence of any security ( something very rare in @entity5 ) leads one to think that even the developers have given up on what is already there			1
frozen over : a view of a vacant carpark in front of ' wonderland ' which was made before construction halted over a decade ago rusting steel : ' all these structures of rusting steel and decaying cement , are another sad example of property development in @entity5 ' , says @entity43 @entity100 ventures : despite @entity5 abandoning its @entity102 , the country does have @entity6 resorts in @entity104 and @entity105 ‘ all these structures of rusting steel and decaying cement , are another sad example of property development in @entity5 involving wasted money , wasted resources and the uprooting of farmers and their families			1
‘ it is a reflection of the country ’s property market which many analysts say the government must keep tightening steps in place			0
‘ the worry is a massive increase in inflation and a speculative bubble that might burst , considering that property sales contribute to around 10 per cent of @entity5 ’s growth ’ , @entity43 continued			1
despite @entity5 abandoning its @entity102 , the country does have @entity6 resorts in @entity104 and @entity105			2
boarded entrance gates : there was absolutely no one to be seen when the photographer walked through one of the entrance gates that was n't boarded up photographer 's steps : footsteps in fresh snow are seen across a walkway leading to the entrance of the derelict amusement park what could have been : a sign for wonderland slowly rusts on the abandoned building			0
