welcome to my first @entity1 boxing column			1
this is where i ’ll be sharing views and news from @entity6 and the logical place to start is the subject of a @entity11 - @entity10 re-match			1
it ’s logical because it is a fight i get asked about every day			2
it ’s also something i am working very hard on and i hope to have a more concrete answer in the next two weeks			2
in the meantime , i can give you an idea of the sorts of discussions that have been going on behind the scenes			0
we have had a lot of conversations with both fighters and it ’s a fight i think needs to happen this year			2
if we strike a deal , and there ’s still some way to go , then it ’s a fight i would like to put on in a big stadium on one of the last two saturdays in may			2
we have spoken to @entity32 and numerous other stadiums already – i believe this fight would draw a crowd of 70,000 or 80,000			0
video : scroll down to watch @entity39 's debut @entity1 boxing column slugging it out : a re-match between @entity11 ( left ) and @entity10 would be massive fast start : @entity10 ( right ) , caught @entity11 unawares with the ferocity of his attack in the early stages hold it right there : referee @entity48 stopped the fight in the ninth , leading to a controversial win for @entity11 the important factor in all this is what @entity11 wants			1
he is the unified champion and in the closing stages of his career he has dreams and aspirations , especially to fight in @entity59			0
@entity10 has options and has spoken to other promoters , but obviously he wants @entity11 most			1
and the public want this fight so much – they want answers as to what may have happened after that fantastic fight and the controversy of @entity10 being stopped			1
@entity11 has four options – a rematch with @entity72 super-middleweight champion @entity71 , who beat @entity11 in 2011 ; @entity73 , the middleweight world champion ; @entity74 , the former middleweight champion			1
we all know about @entity10			2
to my mind , the @entity71 fight , commercially speaking , is not big enough			1
the only reason for them to fight is @entity11 wants revenge , but he wants it badly			1
the money is not comparable for the @entity71 fight to the @entity10 and @entity86 fight			1
@entity86 is an easier fight , if you ask me , but politically it would be tough because of the re-match clauses and the money @entity86 wants			2
i do n’t see many reasons for @entity73 to move from middleweight and i have been told by various sources that their team believes @entity11 is the toughest fight out there			1
that ’s the fight his people ooh , ah and wince at			0
it would be a truly great fight between two warriors , but i do n’t think @entity73 is quick enough or awkward enough to grit it out with @entity11 at 168lbs			1
laying out his vision : @entity1 's new columnist @entity39 would love to organise the @entity108 re-match is the door open ? @entity39 says the public appetite for a @entity11 - @entity10 re-match is massive with @entity10 , we know his demands and it is too much , but having not really entered the negotiation period properly , i still believe we can find some middle ground			1
at the moment , we are putting the options together and forecasting the financials and saying : ‘ right , these are the fights and these are the numbers			2
’ if you ask me i ’ll always go with the one with the biggest numbers unless it is very close and one fight is easier or in @entity59 , where @entity11 has always wanted to fight			1
my gut feeling is that it will happen this year			0
i spoke about it with @entity11 last week			2
we talked about the fact it is a big fight and that it will still be around down the line but i do n’t agree with that			0
if @entity10 takes another fight and loses , his value would diminish , and if he wins , he may want a greater split which would make it more difficult to negotiate			1
@entity11 has made a career out of giving the public what they want but he really does n’t like @entity10			1
last time , @entity10 was the mandatory challenger so @entity11 had no choice but to fight him or lose the belt			1
now , in @entity11 ’s mind , there is no reason to fight @entity10 other than the money and the fact it is what the people want to see			1
pride ? i do n’t think he feels in his head that he has a lot to prove , but at the same point , the animosity between the two could potentially drive him like never before			0
get it off the ground : one of the most important factors is whether @entity11 wants the re-match he won the fight , although he does feel it was stopped too early			1
he wishes it would have gone on 10 or 15 seconds because he ’s convinced he would have finished it in devastating fashion			0
i , like many , believe he would have gone on to win the fight – but these unanswered questions make this potentially the biggest bout in @entity165 boxing history			2
even now , a couple of months after the fight , i ca n’t quite believe how good the fight was			0
styles make fights and that is why @entity10 was wrong for @entity11 with his speed and movement			1
he surprised me with how well he did , even though everyone in boxing knows what power @entity10 has			1
i was there at the press conference when @entity10 said he was going to stand and trade in the middle of the ring			2
to be honest , after that press conference , that was the first time i thought @entity11 was going to be absolutely fine			1
i always thought he would win , but that made me certain			0
i thought @entity10 had looked worried in the face - off and was nervous			1
@entity10 was fantastic – i had him two rounds up at the time of the stoppage			1
not firing : despite his victory , @entity11 was not as tuned in for the @entity10 fight as he was for his clashes against @entity190 ( below left ) and @entity192 ( below right ) when you look back at the night , in the changing room beforehand , @entity11 was n’t firing			1
for @entity190 and @entity192 he was so ready			0
this time , it was very cold in the room			0
everyone was rushing around and the mood was just a bit off			0
i thought the problem was @entity11 ’s hunger , like : ‘ what have i got to prove here ? ’ i think @entity11 likes to prove people wrong			2
he had that in his rematch against @entity190 , having lost their first fight , and he was fighting to save his career against @entity192			0
they were probably two of his best fights			0
@entity11 did n’t have that hungry mindset against @entity10			1
if we make this fight , i am convinced he would			0
i have always like the @entity216 ’s boxing coverage			0
i remember spending some time with @entity217 a few years ago when i was promoting @entity218			1
@entity217 had come out to join us at @entity220 in @entity221 , where @entity218 was training for his fight with @entity223			2
we had heard that three murderers were on the loose and hiding out in the mountains , which was a bit of a talking point while we were up there			0
anyway , @entity217 and i went out with @entity218 and a few of his entourage one morning for a run up the mountain			2
after a while , we heard this noise from the side of the road and then three guys wearing @entity237 masks jumped out from behind a rock and they were holding bats			0
i thought i was going to have a heart attack			0
it turned out it was three of @entity218 ’s sparring partners			0
running scared : @entity217 ( second left ) on a training jog with @entity218 ( left ) and his entourage , one of whom ( second right ) appears to be holding a ' @entity237 ' mask my aim for 2014 is more domestic fights			1
i love a good domestic fight – the storyline is often that much better and you know what you are getting with @entity165 fighters			2
you can watch a @entity256 on @entity257 , and he can look great , but then you fly them all the way over here and they do n’t fancy it			0
give me a proper fight			0
i always say to the foreign agents : ‘ tell them to try their nuts off because i want to watch a proper fight and i am paying the purse			0
' there ’s nothing worse than my fighter getting an easy night because then no one gets value for money			0
exciting : but you 'll have to read @entity39 's thoughts on @entity278 ( centre ) in his next session you know what you are getting with a domestic fight and our show on february 1 in @entity286 is looking superb			1
we have @entity287 fighting world title challenger @entity288 for the @entity291 and @entity165 featherweight titles and that is going to be excellent			0
former world champion @entity293 is also fighting @entity294 and then we have @entity278 fighting against @entity295			0
i ca n’t tell you enough how excited i am by @entity278			0
i ’ll save what i think about him for another column .			0

top boxing promoter 's brilliant debut @entity1 column
@entity39 is working very hard to organise @entity11 - @entity10 re-match
ideal time would be on one of the last two saturdays in may
@entity11 must *decide* if he wants to fight but @entity10 is up for it
@entity11 has other options , *including* having another go at @entity71
@entity39 wants to organise more domestic fights in 2014
and there 's a *reminisce* about being scared stiff with @entity217
