@entity1 told his aides : ‘ i just do n’t know if i can do this ’ after his woeful performance during the first presidential debate last year , a new book claims			1
the president was being drilled by staffers to do better in the second round when he told them he was n’t sure if he was up to the job			0
they were so rattled that they feared he might lose the election			0
the candid admission shows how just how scared @entity1 was - and how unprepared he had been to take on his @entity17 opponent @entity16			2
the first presidential debate took place on october 3 last year with @entity1 narrowly ahead of @entity16 in the polls going into it			1
but when the lights went down @entity16 was the clear winner after coming across as more punchy - whilst the president rambled and seemed nervous			0
mr @entity1 did not even mentioning @entity16 ’s notorious 47 per cent remark , or his past at hedge fund @entity34 even though his campaign had been hammering it for months			2
according to @entity44 , in a excerpt from their new book ‘ @entity43 ’ , journalists @entity36 and @entity38 say that at the @entity40 aides to mr @entity1 staged an ‘ intervention ’ to pull him back from the brink			2
during the process they claim the president was struck by self - doubt and said : ‘ i just do n’t know if i can do this ’ , referring to what was needed in the second debate			0
defeated : @entity16 was deemed the winner of the first debate after @entity1 's lackluster performance to solve the problem debate coach @entity59 was brought in and @entity60 , first lady @entity61 and secretary of state @entity62 all gave him advice			1
in the second debate @entity1 was a different person and , according to ‘ @entity43 ’ , thought his performance was ‘ fast and hammy ’			0
revealed : the new details are shared in ' @entity43 ' , which is out next week previously reported extracts from the book have already painted @entity16 in an unflattering light			2
it claims that he did n't ask @entity70 to be his candidate for vice president in his 2012 bid for the @entity40 because of ' potential landmines ' in his health and background checks			1
the @entity79 governor failed to fully answer questions about his health and background and provided less information to @entity16 's vetters than other potential candidates , the book says @entity16 also poked fun at @entity70 's size			1
' @entity16 marveled at @entity70 's girth , ' according to the book			1
' watching a video of @entity70 without his suit jacket on , @entity16 cackled to his aides " guys ! look at that " '			1
@entity16 's search for a vice-presidential nominee was codenamed ' @entity96 ' , but @entity70 was given the name ' @entity97 '			2
in response to the revelations , an aide to @entity70 said : ' governor @entity70 complied fully with the @entity16 campaign ’s request for documents in a timely manner , including a complete medical report from his internist and cardiologist			2
' @entity70 , who underwent lap band surgery in february to help him lose weight , recently released a report from his doctor that said he ' has no medical limitations and is fit to serve as the governor '			0
the book also reveals that president @entity1 's aides considered switching @entity119 out for @entity120 as his vp			1
issues : a new book has revealed that @entity16 ( left ) did n't ask @entity70 ( center ) to be his candidate for vice president in 2012 because of ' potential landmines ' in his health and background checks dropped : @entity16 , pictured with his wife @entity130 , re-considered @entity70 but ultimately decided to drop him the authors explain that @entity70 , who is widely seen as a top candidate among @entity17 for 2016 , left unanswered questions about a defamation lawsuit that was brought against him earlier in his career - putting off @entity16 further			1
he also avoided information about a @entity142 settlement involving his brother , the names and documentation of his household help , details about his time as a securities industry lobbyist and on his medical history , the @entity135 reported			0
' the dossier on the @entity79 governor ’s background was littered with potential land mines , ' the authors write			0
it led @entity16 to initially consider @entity70 before striking him off the list - then reconsider before eventually dropping him again			1
some of the other concerns were over @entity70 's defamation cases - he has both sued and been sued for defamation			0
in 1994 , his @entity159 freeholder primary opponents sued him for claiming they were under investigation by the county prosecutor , the @entity157 explained			0
the case was settled and @entity70 apologized			0
by his side : the book also revealed that @entity1 's aides considering dropping @entity119 as his vp in 1997 , @entity70 sued opponent @entity167 after losing his primary for re-election as a freeholder , but details of the outcome was never disclosed			1
in another book published earlier this year , @entity70 had branded the vetting forms ' intrusive ' , saying the @entity16 campaign expected him to complete 75 pages			1
' asked about stuff with your kids , and issues with your children , obviously criminal record , mental health issues drinking history , drug history , ' he told @entity186 for ' @entity187 '			0
' @entity16 also did n't like the way he showed up late to campaign events , according to the @entity191			0
but there seems to have been no love lost from @entity70 's side either			0
the book claims @entity70 concluded @entity16 's campaign team was a ' gaggle of clowns who could n't organize a one - ring circus ' , according to the @entity191			1
when @entity70 came under fire for his @entity202 speech , claims the book , he confronted @entity204 , a @entity16 aide , and screamed : ' i 'm tired of you people ! ! ! leave me the f * * * k alone ! ! ! ! ' another major revelation in ' @entity43 ' is that @entity1 's top aides secretly considered replacing @entity119 with then - secretary of state @entity120 and carried out focus group sessions and pollings to help them decide it it were the right decision			1
ruled out : but aides ultimately concluded that she would not give enough of a boost to justify the move the consideration was pushed by the chief of staff at the time , @entity222 , who explained that opinion of @entity1 in 2011 was at an all time low			2
‘ i was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things , and this was one of them , ' he said			0
' you have to remember , at that point the president was in awful shape , so we were like , " @entity235 , what do we do ? " ' but the aides eventually dismissed the plan , concluding that , although @entity60 was a popular candidate , it would not give a big enough boost to justify the radical move , the @entity135 reported			0
the book also details @entity1 's opinion of @entity60 , saying that he found him exhausting and once told an aide : ' i like him ... in doses			2
' but ultimately , it explains , @entity1 came to rely on @entity60 as a counselor and immediately called him following @entity16 's concession call on election night .			1
