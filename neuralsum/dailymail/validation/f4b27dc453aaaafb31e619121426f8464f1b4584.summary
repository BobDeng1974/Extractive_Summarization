@entity0 appears to have missed the mark with its new women 's sportswear collection which many female athletes claim is incredibly insulting because of the overtly girly designs			1
the iconic sportswear company teamed up with @entity9 fashion label @entity7 for the eight - piece @entity11 x @entity13 capsule collection , which the brand debuted last month , but many women were left outraged by the impractical pieces , a majority of which retail for $ 200 or more			1
' @entity0 called it a “ bold expression of femininity "			2
in reality , it ’s comical and insulting to female athletes everywhere , ' writer @entity19 said in a piece for @entity21			2
' others have taken to social media to air their grievances with pieces featuring excessive amounts of pleated , billowy fabric that is sure to get in any athletes way - no matter what the activity			2
' seriously , that @entity0 women 's line is hideous			2
women 's athletic wear needs improving , but this is not an improvement			2
