likely @entity1 presidential contenders @entity2 and @entity3 are already clashing over president @entity5 's recently announced shift in @entity7 policy toward @entity8			1
@entity3 has said that lifting a more than 50 year embargo on @entity8 is ' probably a good idea ' while @entity2 has swiftly made himself the face of opposition to normalizing relations with the @entity15 country			1
the argument between the two @entity1 senators escalated last night when @entity18 sen. @entity2 , who is the son of @entity8 immigrants , claimed that @entity20 sen. @entity3 ' has no idea what he ’s talking about ' when it comes to his parents ' home country			1
@entity29 and @entity30 during a press conference in @entity32 , @entity18 on wednesday about the @entity7 ' decision to restore full diplomatic relations with @entity8 and open an embassy in @entity36 for the first time in more than a half century			1
@entity2 has taken a hardline stance against the issue @entity3 has placed himself at odds with several possible @entity1 presidential challengers , including @entity42 sen. @entity41 , also of @entity8 descent , by aligning himself with the president and coming out in support of removing trade and travel restrictions on the @entity49 country located less than 500 miles off the @entity18 coast			1
' this announcement today will be remembered as a tragic mistake , ' @entity41 warned on wednesday after @entity5 's announcement			0
' just like the administration did with @entity55 , right when the administration was feeling the maximum pain it throws them an economic lifeline and continues the brutal repression and dictatorship of the @entity63 brothers , ' he said on @entity64			0
likewise , former @entity18 gov. @entity65 wrote on @entity66 that ' @entity8 is a dictatorship with a disastrous human rights record , and now president @entity5 has rewarded those dictators			2
@entity65 became the first @entity1 candidate to officially acknowledge that he is exploring a presidential run earlier this week , just one day before @entity5 confirmed that his administration was reestablishing high - level diplomatic relations with @entity8			1
the former governor of the state with the largest @entity8 - @entity49 population called @entity5 's move a ' misstep ' and argued that it ' undermines @entity7 's credibility and undermines the quest for a free and democratic @entity8			1
' during a radio interview this week @entity3 said ' if the goal was regime change , [ the embargo ] sure does n’t seem to be working			0
' ' probably , it punishes the people more than the regime because the regime can blame the embargo for hardship , ' he added			0
@entity2 fired back at @entity3 on the @entity93 on thursday night and said , ' like many people who have been opining , he has no idea what he ’s talking about			1
' look , @entity98 's economy looks like @entity8 's economy now , ' he told the @entity64 show 's host , @entity100			2
' you ca n't even buy toilet paper in @entity104			0
and there 's no embargo on @entity98			0
what @entity98 has in common with @entity8 , is they both have adopted radical socialist governmental policies			0
' and i would expect that people would understand that if they just took a moment to analyze that , they would realize that the embargo is not what 's hurting the @entity8 people , ' he continued			2
' it 's the lack of freedom and the lack of competent leaders			0
' @entity2 tore into @entity20 sen. @entity3 on thursday night over @entity3 's decision to come out in support of the president 's @entity8 policy shift			1
@entity3 ' has no idea what he ’s talking about , ' @entity2 accused @entity2 has said he will use his position on the @entity130 to block the creation of a @entity7 embassy in @entity8 and will oppose the lifting of the @entity7 trade embargo on the country , which only @entity136 can authorize			1
in an op - ed in the @entity138 , @entity2 called @entity5 's decision ' a victory for oppressive governments the world over and will have real , negative consequences for the @entity49 people			2
' @entity2 argued that ' the opportunity for @entity8 to normalize relations with the @entity7 has always been there , but the @entity63 regime has never been interested in changing its ways			1
' now , thanks to president @entity5 ’s concessions , the regime in @entity8 wo n’t have to change , ' he asserted			0
he went on to say that the @entity7 policy shift ' is based on the illusion — in fact , on the lie — that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the @entity8 people			1
' @entity8 already enjoys access to commerce , money and goods from other nations , and yet the @entity8 people are still not free			0
' they are not free because the regime — just as it does with every aspect of life — manipulates and controls to its own advantage all currency that flows into the island			0
more economic engagement with the @entity7 means that the regime ’s grip on power will be strengthened for decades to come — dashing the @entity8 people ’s hopes for freedom and democracy			1
' the @entity7 is the only country in the world that restricts interactions with @entity8			2
the @entity183 told reporters this week that it has become clear in the last 53 years that the ' unilateral ' embargo has not had the intended effect			0
' the rest of the world is actually on the other side of this issue			0
they criticize our sanctions regime policy against @entity8 and it actually interferes with our ability to bring to bear pressure from the rest of the international community on the @entity63 regime to better respect human rights , ' the president 's spokesman , @entity191 , said			2
while high - profile @entity1 are mostly aligned in their opposition to the @entity183 's policy , polls taken this year on the issue show that @entity8 - @entity7 in the the influential voting state of @entity18 share @entity3 's views as do the majority of @entity7 across the nation			1
a @entity213 poll of @entity214 in @entity18 taken in june found that 68 percent of the demographic is in favor of reestablishing diplomatic ties with @entity8 and 69 percent want travel restrictions eliminated			2
a majority also said they were in favor of doing away with trade restrictions , 52 percent , and that the embargoes have not worked , 71 percent			0
and nationally , majorities of @entity7 in both political parties support resuming relations with @entity8 , a total of 56 percent , according to an @entity229 poll taken in february .			0

@entity20 sen. @entity3 said lifting a more than 50 year embargo on @entity8 is ' probably a good idea
@entity18 sen. @entity2 , who is the son of @entity8 immigrants , claimed that @entity3 ' has no idea what he ’s talking about '
high - profile *republicans* are mostly aligned in their opposition to the @entity183 's policy , with the notable *exception* of @entity3
polls taken earlier this year show that @entity8 - @entity7 in @entity18 share @entity3 's views , however , as do the majority of @entity7 across the nation
