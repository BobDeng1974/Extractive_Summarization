by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 16:06 est , 17 october 2013 one month after losing the @entity3 mayoral primary , @entity1 has published the closest thing to a heartfelt apology from @entity6			1
@entity6 's chances at becoming mayor were shot on july 23 , when 23 - year - old @entity9 released graphic pictures and ' sexts ' from married @entity6 sent after he stepped down from @entity12 in 2011 for a similar scandal			1
@entity6 was then , as he is now , married to long - time @entity15 - aide @entity14			1
the two have a child together , 20 - month - old @entity18			2
while @entity6 has apologized for his behavior before , it was n't until the interview conducted after the race that he seems to finally realize the pain he heaped on @entity14 , describing himself as an ' empty soulless vessel '			1
hindsight : in this month 's @entity1 , @entity6 gives a candid post-election interview finally giving an emotional apology for the pain he 's caused wife @entity29			1
above , @entity6 conceded the mayoral primary last month unlike in 2011 , @entity6 decided to stick out the race and a few days later , reporter @entity32 started following @entity6 on the campaign trail - becoming a witness to his demise			1
during his time with @entity6 , the candidate continued to heap blame back on the handling of the scandal , saying that if it were n't for the internet he might have had a shot at winning the whole race			1
' maybe if the internet did n't exist ? like if i was running in 1955 ? i 'd probably get elected mayor , ' he said			2
sore loser : a defeated @entity6 shown flipping off reporters while leaving his ' victory party ' at @entity52 but the tone of the story changed a week after losing the election , when @entity6 finally opened up and expressed his remorse for hurting wife @entity29 , while still maintaining that his sexting was ' meaningless '			1
@entity6 explained , that to him , sexting women like @entity60 was like playing a video game			1
' you ask about the higher meaning of sexting , but it was remarkably meaningless			0
it was almost like a video game you played in that did n't have much connection to reality			2
' to further illustrate the point , @entity6 mimuics typing on a keyboard : ' @entity74 clicky clicky - send ! @entity74 send			1
the intellectual part of my brain was saying , " why was this so bad ? " ' together : after the second sexting scandal emerged in july , @entity6 's wife @entity29 continued to stand by her man by saying she forgave him at a press conference @entity6 stepped down from @entity12 in 2011 after accidentally tweeting a lude picture of himself			1
his past came back to haunt him in july when sexting partner @entity9 , above , released more pictures and texts from the candidate while he may not have been thinking about it at the time , @entity6 now recognizes that those actions impacted his wife			1
' this weird synapse in my mind fired in a different direction , and i realized " wait a minute			0
it 's not very significant to me			0
but it 's significant to @entity14			0
it does n't really matter what i think about it			0
it kinda matters , the impact it 's having on her			0
" and that switch going off made the game no longer interesting			0
it was n't like playing @entity108 ! it was n't like playing an online role - playing game			2
' second chances : while the two have n't been pictured together since @entity6 's primary loss , they are reportedly still living together in their @entity116 apartment despite the hurt he caused her , wife @entity14 has seemingly stood by her husband this second scandal and even after losing the election - despite rumors that she has been told to dump him if she wants to work on @entity15 's presidential campaign			1
' we 've had a very rough time , ' @entity6 said			2
' it causes me a great deal of pain in the way she gets reported and the way she gets discussed			0
her treatment in the press has been rough			0
it pains me because i deserve it			0
' @entity139 duck it as best as i can			0
but her reputation has come the woman who married an idiot and stuck with him			0
more of it rolls of my back , because that 's the way i am constitutionally			0
i 'm just an empty soulless vessel , so it does n't hurt me as much			0
' still , @entity6 would n't directly answer the question of whether or not the two would be sticking together after his second betrayal , brushing off the question with a critique of the media 's curiosity about his personal life			1
stay - at - home - dad : since losing the race with only 5 per cent of the vote , @entity6 has returned to his role as dutiful dad - escorting son @entity18 to the park lost : @entity6 told @entity1 that if it were n't for the internet , he probably would have been elected mayor ' she 'd stay with me if i broke twenty points ! and actually if i made the runoff , she 'd recommit the vows , in a @entity176 vacation			1
if i won , she 'd have a second child with me ! i do n't know how people think , ' he said			2
@entity179 ends the conversation by asking @entity6 if he would still run for mayor , if given the opportunity to go back and do it all over again			2
while @entity6 defended his run throughout the race , after losing he makes a more realistic statement			2
' if i could go back ? if you tell me i 'm gon na get 5 per cent , you tell me how i 'd answer that question			0
the process i went through to decide to run was the right one ; the way i talked about sexting was ... not right			0

in @entity1 's latest story on @entity6 , the former - @entity193 mayoral candidate said he might have won the race if it were n't for the internet
@entity6 's chances of winning ended with the *revelation* of a second sexting scandal in july
in his post-election interview , @entity6 says that sexting was like a game to him , but *admits* that it had *repercussions* on his relationship to wife @entity29
