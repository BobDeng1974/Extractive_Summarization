one of the country ’s most senior police officers was accused of ‘ sheer incompetence ’ last night over his handling of the raid on the home of sir @entity7			1
the @entity9 and @entity10 police clashed in @entity11 over how tv reporters were able to film live aerial shots of a raid on sir @entity7 's home last month			1
the chief constable of @entity17 said the @entity9 put his force in ‘ a very difficult position ’ after confronting officers with leaked information about the planned search in connection with allegations of a historic sexual assault			1
mr @entity26 told @entity27 on the @entity28 that his force was convinced that the broadcaster would run a story about the investigation without some kind of deal			1
committee mp @entity34 said it was a ‘ rather remarkable blackmail attempt ’			2
but the @entity9 flatly rejected the accusation and claimed they would have pulled the story if the police had asked			2
a @entity9 crew reportedly arrived on the scene before the police , while sir @entity7 was abroad in his holiday home in @entity59			1
mr @entity26 told @entity27 that his concern was that ' if we showed the @entity9 the door , the very clear impression which had been left with my staff in the media department was that they were likely to publish the story '			1
he said : ' that would have impeded our investigation			0
' chairman of the committee @entity42 put it to the senior officer that the broadcaster had blackmailed him , but mr @entity26 replied : ‘ blackmail is a very strong word			2
it put us in a very difficult position			1
’ mr @entity26 also apologised sir @entity7 if the force was ‘ insensitive ’ about the search of his home			1
he said : ‘ we had a job to do but i do apologise to sir @entity7 if we were insensitive about the way that we did that			1
we had a job to do , and we have an investigation			0
the problem is that investigation could never be done in a low - profile way because it was fatally compromised from the outset			2
’ mr @entity26 added : ‘ the coverage was disproportionate and made our actions look heavy - handed and intrusive			0
’ but in subsequent evidence to mps this afternoon , @entity9 director general @entity95 told the committee : ‘ had the chief constable come to a news editor , head of news gathering , @entity100 , director of news or myself and said to us “ if you run this story you will hamper this investigation , it would be damaging to this investigation ” we would not have run the story			1
‘ i want you to be absolutely clear about that			0
we would not have run the story			0
’ @entity95 added that reporter @entity111 went to @entity112 to discuss ‘ a number of stories ’ and had a tip off from a source which he will not reveal referring to @entity7			1
he said there was ‘ no hint in any of that of us knowing any more than the name @entity7 ’			0
@entity95 said : ‘ the reporter did n't have a story until he went to @entity112 ... and they gave him the story			2
’ the @entity9 boss added : ‘ @entity112 had given us a story , had made no attempt to stop us running the story ’ he said : ‘ it was a proper story for us to cover , in the right matter , proportionately , which i think is what we did			1
i was n't surprised the police did n't ask us not to broadcast the story			0
’ following the evidence mr @entity42 said that as far as far as the committee was concerned , the @entity9 ' have acted perfectly properly in respect of this matter '			0
@entity9 reporter @entity139 covered the @entity7 raid by police live a @entity143 helicopter filmed police arriving to search sir @entity7 's @entity146 property sir @entity7 , who was in @entity59 when the search took place , firmly denied any wrongdoing and hit out at the fact @entity9 journalists were apparently tipped off about the plan			1
he has cancelled a series of public appearances since the search , and has been interviewed under caution by police , but not arrested or charged			0
the @entity9 's head of news gathering @entity160 said that the information did not come from @entity112 , while the force said it had decided to work with the broadcaster to protect its investigation			1
sir @entity7 was at his home in @entity59 when police raided his @entity146 property mr @entity26 has revealed that the force was approached by a @entity9 journalist with detailed information about its investigation , and ‘ reluctantly ’ the reporter was give notice of the planned search to dissuade the corporation from publishing details in advance			1
he objected to an analysis piece published on the @entity9 website that he felt suggested that there had been a deliberate attempt to ' ensure maximum coverage ' by the force , and accused the broadcaster of trying to ‘ distance itself ’ from the fact it had initiated contact with them			2
@entity49 said it had no contact with the media before the search warrant was executed			0
the appearance before the committee today comes at a turbulent time for @entity112 , which last week came under fire for failing to protect vulnerable victims of crime			0
@entity112 's public protection unit , which handles sex crimes such as rape , honour - based violence and domestic abuse , had an ' unacceptable ' culture that saw officers spending a lot of time trying to disprove allegations , @entity196 said			2
the area 's police and crime commissioner @entity207 is also facing increasing pressure to quit over the child abuse scandal in @entity212			0
mr @entity207 was the labour council cabinet member responsible for children 's services in @entity212 from 2005 to 2010 , during a 16 - year period when 1,400 youngsters suffered wide - scale sexual exploitation including gang rapes , grooming and trafficking			0
he has apologised to victims , insisting he had no knowledge of the scale of the problem when he was a councillor in the @entity10 town , but has refused to quit his gbp85 , 000 - a - year elected post as @entity208			0
this is despite calls by the prime minister and the home secretary for him to resign , his deputy having quit , and being forced to leave the @entity233			0
sir @entity7 was questioned under caution last month by @entity112 but not arrested or charged			1
he said the allegation of an assault at a religious event in @entity239 in 1985 is ‘ completely false ’			0
a letter from his lawyers sent to mps confirmed he was not told in advance of the search and found out about it only from a concierge at the property			0
details of text and email exchanges between police and the @entity9 before the raid are due to be published today and mr @entity26 will answer questions again next week .			2

but the @entity9 said they would not have run the story if requested by police
