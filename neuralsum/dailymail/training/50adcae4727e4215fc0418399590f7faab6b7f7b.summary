word at @entity4 's state - of - the - art @entity2 training complex is that the club will make a concerted effort to sign @entity8 striker @entity7 in january			1
what 's for sure is manager @entity10 needs to inject some life into his misfiring forward line , sooner rather than later			0
wednesday night 's @entity14 clash against @entity15 merely underlined the @entity18 club 's need for a shiny new striker once the transfer window re-opens			2
@entity21 failed to find the net once again as @entity4 struggled against @entity15 @entity23 will reportedly make a january move for @entity8 striker @entity7 between them , @entity23 ' strike trio of @entity26 , @entity21 and @entity27 have scored five domestic goals this season			1
@entity27 , who scored last night , and @entity26 have two apiece , @entity21 just one			1
two of the five - both from @entity26 - have come in the league			0
in short : not good enough			0
certainly not good enough for a team with aspirations of breaking into the @entity34 qualification places			0
it was @entity21 and @entity27 's turn to improve on that dismal record last night			1
but , once more , chance after chance was squandered before @entity27 tapped home late on as @entity15 chased an equaliser			1
@entity27 , if given a prolonged run in the team , could solve @entity10 's problems - but the manager 's reluctance to start the @entity48 man in the league speaks volumes			2
' you demand me to play @entity27 in every game and he played today , ' said @entity10 last night			0
' he [ @entity27 ] shares with @entity26 and @entity21 , they can share minutes , we need to understand that			1
@entity10 , upon his arrival from @entity8 , insisted he wanted to give those at the club a chance to ink themselves into his blueprint			0
@entity27 ( left ) looks to get away from @entity15 ' @entity66 in the @entity14 clash @entity27 found the net with a second half strike to put @entity4 into commanding 2 - 0 lead but with every passing 90 minutes , the @entity71 knows he 'll have to spend on a new striker in january			1
his interest in @entity7 , a player he worked with and helped nurture at @entity74 's , is no secret			0
there was a willingness , certainly from @entity10 , to strike a deal with the @entity8 for the @entity48 international in the summer			0
the long - term knee injury @entity7 sustained towards the end of last season was one of the crucial factors in @entity23 decision not to show more commitment in their attempts to land the 25 - year - old			1
but @entity7 is now approaching fitness ; @entity10 knows it to , having been kept updated on his target 's rehabilitation			2
@entity94 slots @entity4 into a 1 - 0 lead against @entity15 on tuesday night @entity94 celebrates his second half strike with the @entity4 faithful at @entity18 what 's more , those in control of the finances at @entity18 and are prepared to fund his move for @entity7 at the turn of the year			1
persuading , @entity7 to leave upwardly mobile @entity8 for @entity23 maybe harder than it sounds , though			1
@entity10 will hope his relationship with the striker will help lure the forward to @entity107			0
at the moment , with his current strikeforce , hope is all he has			0
@entity10 inherited this @entity23 forward line , and until he is able to stamp his mark on it in the transfer market , he can not truly call this @entity23 side			2
@entity10 is aware @entity4 will have to look for a striker in the january transfer window			2

@entity21 fails to find the net against @entity15
@entity4 struggle to 2 - 0 @entity120 win against @entity122 side
@entity27 scores second half goal but @entity23 want a new striker
@entity8 *frontman* @entity7 is a target
