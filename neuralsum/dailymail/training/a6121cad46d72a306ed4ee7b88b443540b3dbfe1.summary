emails from a secret listserv of two former @entity3 aides angling to run her next presidential campaign were published online friday , creating a yet another media headache for the 2016 frontrunner before she 's even announced her candidacy			1
calling themselves the ' mafia , ' the list is reportedly run by @entity12 operatives @entity13 and @entity14 , both of whom worked on @entity17 's 2008 , as a way to stay in touch with former colleagues			1
the colorful emails , released today by @entity22 , reveal @entity13 calling on his friends to ' smite @entity25 mafia - style ' and @entity14 encouraging them to ' punish those voters , ' in addition to other unflattering statements			1
on the left is special assistant to the president and principal deputy director of the @entity33 , @entity14			2
to the right is @entity12 operative @entity13			2
today @entity22 released their colorful emails , sent to a private listserv , after a confidante of the @entity3 alum backstabbed them in an effort to keep them from being chosen to manage @entity3 's possible 2016 presidential campaign @entity13 is pictured here with president @entity44 and other administration officials in the @entity46 on april 1 , 2014 @entity13 , 34 , is a veteran of several high - level campaigns , including @entity49 's 2004 presidential campaign			1

the best buddies were betrayed this week by one of their own friends eyeing a job with @entity17 in an attempt to hinder the duo 's chances of being hired for top jobs with the @entity12 star			1
according to @entity22 , ' the person who provided the emails is , like the vast majority of those on the listserv , supportive of @entity3 , but does not support the idea of @entity93 or @entity14 holding leadership roles in a second presidential bid			1
' while none of the emails are especially damning , they certainly do n't paint the two portray the two potential campaign managers in a positive light at times , either , and provide an unnecessary distraction from both their credentials and their candidate 's			2
as former @entity109 adviser @entity108 said on twitter today : ' the infighting to be @entity3 's 1st ( & 2nd ) campaign manager / leader will be more negative than @entity25 presidential nomination fight			1

' if you have just a few minutes , hop on that activate and punish those voters ! ' @entity14 wrote			1
in 2011 , when @entity14 was moving to @entity141 , @entity142 , to take a new position , @entity93 announced a going away party for him and wrote , ' it 's true : @entity14 is leaving our fold			2
today is the day the grownassman [ sic ] grows up and leaves for @entity150 's @entity149			0

' the location has led to increased speculation that @entity3 , who lives in @entity195 and would likely base her headquarters in the state , will formally announce her candidacy in the next two months			0
@entity3 poses with a young fan as she takes a back door exit out of the @entity203 at @entity204 in @entity195 on monday			0

@entity3 herself has acknowledged that she is considering another presidential campaign and she will make her decision known sometime next year			0
