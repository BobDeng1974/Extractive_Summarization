giant transparent screens such as those used by @entity3 in the hit film @entity5 could soon become a reality , researchers have claimed			1
they say the smart glass breakthrough could even make your phone more intelligent - building health monitoring sensors directly into the glass			1
they say the breakthrough already works with @entity14 , found in the majority of smartphones , and could be implemented into handsets within a year			1
the breakthrough will allow transparent screens such as the one used by @entity3 in the hit film @entity5 to become a reality			1
to make their see - through temperature - sensing and phone - authentication systems , the researchers turned to photonics			2
while electronic devices transmit information via electrons , photonic devices use light			2
the researchers used lasers to carve out transparent pathways called waveguides into the glass			1
these waveguides act as tunnels that channel light , analogous to the way electronic wires convey electrical signals , and form the basis for a host of applications			2
the technology developed by researchers from @entity46 and the @entity48 - based company @entity47 has led to the first laser - written light - guiding systems that are efficient enough to be developed for commercial use			2
this revolutionary work could open up new real estate in the phone by embedding the glass with layer upon layer of sensors , including ones that could take your temperature , assess your blood sugar levels if you 're diabetic or even analyze dna			1
the researchers have already used their new technology to build two completely transparent systems - a temperature sensor and a new system for authenticating a smartphone using infrared light - into a type of glass that 's currently used in most smartphones			1
in addition to biomedical sensors , the technology could also eventually allow computing devices to be embedded into any glass surface , such as windows or tabletops , creating the transparent touchscreens seen in movies like @entity83 and @entity5 , the researchers say			1
' we 're opening the @entity85 at the moment , ' says paper co-author @entity87 , a professor of electrical engineering and engineering physics at @entity91 in @entity92			2
now that the technique is viable , ' it 's up to people to invent new uses ' for it , he says			2
an invisible waveguide ( pathway for light ) being written via laser into a smartphone 's display glass is shown			1
the waveguide is a horizontal line from the left side of the screen they describe their work in a paper published today in the @entity112 's ( @entity112 ) open - access journal , @entity113			0
although people have used lasers to make photonic waveguides before , this is the first time anyone has applied the technique to @entity14 , a tough glass with high internal stress and low irregularity , developed by @entity47 that 's now used in billions of electronic devices			1
according to first author @entity125 of @entity91 , this new photonic waveguide is the best that 's ever been made using lasers			0
while no waveguide is perfect — light will inevitably leak out due to imperfections — the new waveguides created by the team are 10 times better at minimizing such loss than previous ones made with lasers , he says			0
' we are actively looking to partner with industry to exploit this technology , ' @entity87 says			0
with focused development , he adds , the two systems could potentially be integrated commercially into smartphones within a year			1
to demonstrate their technique , the researchers built a standard type of temperature sensor that consists of a straight and a curved waveguide			0
when the glass heats up , it expands and changes the path length of the waveguides			1
by measuring how the light that emerges from one waveguide interferes with light from the other , the device can measure temperature – yours or that of anything it touches			0

by measuring how the light that emerges from one waveguide interferes with light from the other , the device can measure temperature ¿ yours or that of anything it touches			0
the researchers also developed a new method for authenticating a smartphone based on waveguides with holes at various locations			1
the light that escapes through those holes creates a pattern that is unique to their arrangement			0
the idea is that each phone would have its own unique pattern , like a fingerprint , which could then be read by an infrared detector to confirm the identity of the phone as an additional layer of security for making financial transactions using smartphones			0
such transactions could be relatively safe because instead of using radio frequency they use infrared light , which is blocked by most materials and therefore can not be copied through a pocket or purse			0
both the temperature sensor and authentication system are being patented and the team is hoping to optimize them for use in consumer devices			0
and because @entity14 has greater internal stress and less irregularities than other types of glass , the waveguides are smoother and better at preventing light from escaping			1
this also means the researchers can use lower energy ultra-short laser pulses at a high repetition rate , which results in smoother and more efficient waveguides			0
current techniques such as photolithography — which uses light - sensitive chemicals to etch or deposit material — are very good at minimizing light loss , but the team 's laser method is cheaper and simpler , @entity214 says			0
also , photolithography restricts waveguides to the surface of the glass			2
but using lasers enables researchers to make waveguides at any depth , allowing them to create many applications , one on top of each other , like layers in a cake			0
layering the waveguides within the glass itself paves the way for more compact devices , which means you could squeeze more apps into your phone .			2

breakthrough allows sensors to be etched directly on glass
could be used to turn windows into giant ' @entity5 ' displays
could also embed sensors into smartphone glass within a year
