an amorous @entity1 couple have been fined £ 9,000 for having such noisy sex that it forced their neighbours to move out			1
the pair , who are in their 30s , were convicted of noise pollution and harassment for the ' raucous screams ' during steamy sex sessions at their apartment in the northern town of @entity13			1
their long - suffering neighbours , who first took them to court in 2009 , described the wails of passion as ' deafening ' and said it kept them and their two children awake			1
the couple , who are in their 30s , have been ordered to pay £ 9,000 after being convicted of noise pollution and harassment for the ' deafening ' screams during sex sessions at their home in @entity13 , @entity1 ( file picture ) the man , who has not been named , was sentenced to four months in prison in 2011 , and his fiancée given a noise abatement order			1
but the couple appealed the sentence and have now been ordered to pay £ 7,000 in damages to their neighbours who now live elsewhere , and £ 2,000 in legal fees			1
the apartment next door to the noisy couple currently remains unoccupied , the @entity38 newspaper said			1
it comes less than six months after a woman from @entity44 , in the north east of @entity46 , was given a 12 - week jail term and a four - year anti-social behaviour order ( @entity49 ) for having noisy sex			1
@entity51 complained about @entity53 's loud screams during sex sessions with her husband of 38 years and moaned that they could hear the bed banging against the wall from the adjacent house			1
at the time , mrs @entity53 explained : ' it was a metal headboard so it used to bang on the wall			0
' there was no carpet back then , so when you have sex , the bed goes back and forward			2
' if you get to a point where the bed 's banging on the wall , you 're not going to stop , are you ? ' as far as i 'm concerned , that 's what you should be doing			0
it 's not as if i 'm having sex and think : " oh , i 'm making too much noise			1
i better be quiet "			0
' mrs @entity53 was initially handed a noise abatement order which was later upgraded to an asbo after she breached the order five times			2
the asbo forbade her from ' shouting , screaming and vocalisation ' during sex or from playing loud music			2
@entity53 , from @entity44 , was jailed for 12 weeks and handed a four - year @entity49 for having noisy sex with her husband of 38 years , @entity84			1
@entity51 complained about mrs @entity53 's loud screams @entity53 and @entity84 ( pictured together above leaving court last year ) were visited by police countless times after neighbours complained their sex sessions were loud enough to drown out television programmes however , in a bid to get around the restrictions , mrs @entity53 switched her sex sessions to the morning leaving neighbours - who complained that she was noisy enough to drown out their tvs - less than impressed			1
' i was n't supposed to make excessive noise that could be heard in a neighbouring property or outside , ' she explained			2
mrs @entity53 was later arrested and admits she was even having sex with her husband @entity84 when police arrived to take to her into custody			0
the 53 - year - old was taken to court , handed an eight - week suspended prison sentence and forced to live in a bail hostel for weeks			0
a year later , and after scores more complaints and visits from the police , she was again arrested for breaching her asbo following two police callouts in two days			0
again , she was handed a suspended sentence , this time for 12 weeks , and sent to live in a bail hostel where she was held alongside serious criminals , including murderers			0
however , despite her convictions , mrs @entity53 , who has since bought a less noisy wooden bed , remains adamant that she 's done nothing wrong			0
she said : ' i do n't see why i should stop having sex in my own house with my husband of 38 years			0
' i 'm sure there could be a lot worse things i could be doing			0
they all thought it was stupid i was in prison			0
' i mean i was in the same prison as people like @entity134 for making a noise when i have sex			2
there could be a real crime going on while they 're busy arresting me			0
