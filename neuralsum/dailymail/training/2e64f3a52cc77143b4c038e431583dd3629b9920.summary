by @entity0 @entity1 , 47 , was left in a coma after routine surgery to investigate pelvic pain went horribly wrong a woman admitted to hospital for keyhole surgery was left fighting for life after doctors accidentally tore her bowel			1
@entity1 was admitted to the @entity11 in @entity12 to have her pelvic pain investigated			1
the 47 - year - old went home the same day but was rushed back to hospital early the next morning , suffering from severe abdominal pain and vomiting			1
a ct scan performed two days later revealed her bowel had been sliced open and fluid was leaking into the rest of her body			1
further exploratory surgery then confirmed she had two holes in her bowel			2
doctors removed a section of her intestines and flushed out as much as the infection as they could			0
but they were forced to leave her stomach open for two days in an attempt to avoid ms @entity1 needing a stoma bag fitted			1
the mother - of - two then required further surgery two days later to re-attach her bowel and have her stomach sewn up			1
but medics were forced to leave her in an induced coma for five days to help fight the infection which had caused her organs fail			0
ms @entity1 was eventually discharged from hospital two weeks later - but has been left with horrific scars all down her stomach			1
@entity45 has now apologised and mrs @entity1 's solictors have secured an admission of liability from the @entity45 and secretary of state for health , paving the way for a settlement to be reached			2
ms @entity1 , who lives in @entity52 , @entity53 , with her fiance @entity54 , 47 , and daughter @entity55 , 14 , said : ' my life has been turned upside down following my horrific ordeal			1
' my original surgery was keyhole surgery which is designed to be minimally invasive and leave little , to no , scarring			1
' it was meant to be a routine procedure i went into hospital for , but instead i was left fighting for my life			2
' the scarring on my stomach is horrendous and i am incredibly self - conscious of it			2
' i feel truly let down by staff as i suffered so many needless complications and my life has been devastated as a result			0
' after being discharged from hospital , ms @entity1 's hair fell out because stress and amount of medication she was on			2
ms @entity1 with fiance @entity54 and daughter @entity55			0
she says the trauma of the botched surgery made her hair fall out and forced her to give up work ' it was coming out in clumps , it was really a mess and looked like a patchwork quilt - so in the end , i shaved it off and was forced to buy wigs			0
' ms @entity1 was also forced to close down her cleaning business after her ordeal			2
she added : ' i am pleased that with the help of my legal team that the @entity45 has finally made an admission of liability for what happened to me			0
' i just hope that this paves the way to the conclusion of the legal proceedings so that i can try to start to put my life back together			0
' medical law experts at @entity101 found a host of errors had been made during the surgery on august 9 , 2011 , which had led to the bowel perforating			0
it is claimed that staff failed to appreciate that a perforation was the likely cause of ms prices 's symptoms - and did not perform an immediate ct scan on her readmission the next day			0
following the initial keyhold procedure , she was also treated by junior doctors who failed to detect peritonitis , multi-organ failure , abscesses , scarring and an incisional hernia			0
tests carried out when ms @entity1 was severely ill after surgery revealed her bowel had been sliced open and fluid was leaking into the rest of her body			1
she has been left with scars all down her stomach @entity130 , a specialist medical lawyer at @entity101 , said : ' @entity1 suffered a truly horrendous ordeal in hospital following what should have been a simple and routine procedure with minimal recovery time			1
' instead she was left fighting for her life and needing further operations that have left her with extensive scarring - a permanent reminder of the horrific ordeal she has been through			1
' dr @entity141 , medical director at @entity45 , said : ' we reiterate our apologies to ms @entity1 and her family for the shortcomings in our care in 2011			0
' although ms @entity1 was reviewed by specialist registrars or consultants on each of the three days between her initial and second operation , we accepted our external expert â€™s view that senior review should have been more frequent			2
this lesson was shared with all staff in the department			0
' @entity45 has done considerable work in the last two years to improve recognition of deterioration in patients , and to speed - up escalation to senior doctors when it does occur			0
