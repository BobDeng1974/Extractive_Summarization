by @entity0 published : 20:47 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 20:50 est , 11 january 2013 chaotic childhood : @entity0 , seen aged four with his mother @entity2 in 1980 , describes the entrepreneuer as ' unique ' what no one tells you when you become a parent is just how judgmental you will be towards fellow parents			1
that feeling of self - righteous smugness as you mentally admonish how others feed , discipline and entertain their offspring can be utterly overwhelming			1
and , sadly , the parents who bear the brunt of it tend to be our very own			1
how can you not compare and contrast the childhood your parents gave you with what you hope to provide for your children ? those with happy memories want to replicate their experiences , then there are others whose experiences serve as a warning , a map of exactly what not to do			1
guess which camp i fall into ? i had a unique mother			1
an army of nannies , chauffeurs , cleaners and cooks served in the front line of my and my sister ’s young lives , presided over from far in the rear by @entity44 @entity2 , @entity45			1
my mother was the inspiration for @entity50 ’s rather bonkers @entity49 supremo , @entity48			1
if you ’ve ever seen @entity50 on tv , you ’ll already have a pretty clear picture of the madness i faced daily while growing up			1
what was n’t in the show was the fact i ’d had more than 20 nannies by the time i was 16			1
some were good , some much less so — and none could hack life in our house for long			1
even though in numerous interviews my mum has gone into how she regrets not being around for much of our childhoods , she can be sensitive when i say something similar			1
if you 've ever seen @entity50 ... you 'll have a pretty clear picture of the madness i faced daily while growing up i do n’t want to upset her ( i also have to think of the long game : i do n’t want to be cut out of the will ) , but it ’s fair to say her career came first when my sister and i were growing up			1
the legend goes that 20 minutes after i was born she was on the phone to work , and she did n’t get off again until i was in my late teens			1
during that time , she and my father @entity82 , a designer , also managed to raise me as a @entity83 , shove macrobiotic food down my throat and live as a @entity86			1
and those were the fun parts			1
i did n’t think so at the time			1
i grumbled and whined my way through it all , but without them , i would n’t be the interestingly troubled soul i am today			1
i would n’t change any of it ( well , maybe the macrobiotic food )			1
inspiration : workaholic pr guru @entity95 , left , inspired the character of chain - smoking , champagne - swilling @entity50 in @entity50 , played by @entity98 i had a life of privilege with expensive schools , exotic luxury holidays and the best therapists to complain to			1
i feel lucky to have had parents whose hard work led to so many opportunities for us — but it ’s not the kind of upbringing i ’d dream of inflicting on my own children			1
i have two young sons and the vagaries of my childhood could n’t be more different to theirs			1
they have two adoring parents who share the childcare			1
it is the complete opposite of the parenting model i grew up with			1
with a third energy - sapper on the way to join our 11 - month - old , art , and three - year - old , @entity120 , a chorus of inquiries is swelling as to whether my wife and i will be getting a nanny			2
the answer is a thundering : ‘ never ! ’ at most , a friend will look after the children if my wife and i need to be somewhere			2
for us , having children is about getting our hands dirty			2
not only with the nappies , but by nourishing each offshoot of personality , each growth of self			2
this is in stark contrast to my own childhood			2
wildly eccentric : looking back @entity0 , seen with his mother in 1997 , left , can identify with the character of long - suffering @entity145 in @entity50 , seen right with on - screen mother @entity147 i ’ve no memory of the earliest nannies , but someone must have kept us alive during the endless days where my sister @entity152 and i would be lucky to catch a glimpse of either parent			1
things changed slightly when i was eight and my parents became @entity157			1
from then , what little time they did have before and after work was spent chanting			2
an hour - and - a - half every single day			2
i was mesmerised by a friend 's mum making a sandwich when it became apparent this was the only time i ’d get to spend in their company , i joined in			2
i also worked out that if i wanted anything — say a new bike — i ’d just have to say i ’d been chanting for one and it would magically appear			2
at the weekends , we were all together , after a fashion			2
saturdays were spent being dragged to photo - shoots and fashion shows			2
it sounds exciting , but when you ’re six , what this really entails is trying not to get up to too much trouble in the corner while throngs of adults run about you in a flustered panic			2
flashing cameras ? supermodels ? boring ! meanwhile , sundays were taken up with all - day lunches in expensive trendy restaurants			2
crawling under tables among the legs of the important and talented can lose its shine after a few years			2
i hated the lack of consistency			2
one minder left after just four hours			2
@entity196 repeatedly formed , then broken , created issues of abandonment for me that exist to this day			2
this is partly why i wanted three children — now my wife can never leave me			0
workaholic parents are worse than alcoholics because meetings ca n’t cure them — so each nanny ’s departure heralded a new chapter of my childhood			1
i clearly remember @entity209 , who was with me for three years until i was six , but she detested me and @entity152			0
as precocious as we were , this only really made sense when we found out years later that @entity209 and my dad had been having an affair			0
on - screen : @entity145 , @entity218 's long - suffering and straight - laced daughter , was played by @entity220 in the classic @entity222 comedy , which starred @entity98 and @entity223 @entity224 followed @entity209 and a blissful year of unconditional love and happiness followed , until the poor woman abruptly left after having descended into schizophrenia			0
@entity229 came next — but she abandoned us for @entity232 ’s children			0
yes , @entity233 stole my nanny ! ... it 's not the kind of upbringing i 'd dream of inflicting on my own children @entity239 , though , was our favourite			0
fair , unbiased , friendly , strict			0
two years of stability and boundaries followed her arrival , and she ’s the only reason i ’m half normal			0
if only she had finished the job instead of getting pregnant by our hairdresser			0
then came 1985 — the year of nannies with no names			0
i ’ve no idea why we got through so many then , but there was never enough time to learn who they were			0
stability , of a sort , was found in the massive form of @entity262 rugby player @entity261 late that year			0
but she was fired after hitting me for breaking her @entity265 cassette			0
my dad sacked her on the spot with the simultaneously comforting and unsettling words : ‘ the only person who gets to hit my children is me			0
’ i remember thinking how gallant he was to protect me , because she could so easily have taken him			0
so nannies came and nannies went and i do n’t believe i was at all unhappy			0
this home life was my reality and i did n’t know any different			0
all this changed when i visited my friend @entity276 ’s house one day after school in 1986 when i was ten			0
i was mesmerised by his mother standing in their kitchen , making us a sandwich			1
my little brain could n’t compute what was happening			0
why was his mother home in the afternoon ? why was she asking what we wanted ? why was she doing it herself ? had i gone to heaven ? eccentric : @entity2 now relishes the job of being a grandmother , her son says these seemed to be the dominant archetypes of femininity i was exposed to during the @entity300 : docile housewife or career woman			1
my mother , ever ahead of the curve , was the most extreme version of the latter			1
but they did n’t parent hard			0
i do n’t think it ’s helpful to look at the past and apportion blame			0
my parents were from a different generation with different values , reacting against their own upbringings			1
but amid the desperate struggle to get on the housing ladder , modern - day parents are more inclined to want to enjoy time with their children			1
@entity322 families like mine might form part of the first generation to achieve some kind of balance : to work hard and play hard — but with the playing done with our children			0
my wife and i share the role of primary carer to our children and we get to work passionately on our careers			0
where i ’m exceptionally blessed is having my wife to hold my hand			0
she ’s the embodiment of nurturing and has enough love and attention for the children and to fill my own bottomless pit of neediness			0
she ’s also a therapist ( very useful for me ) and the hours work well around the children			0
i ’m at home all day when she ’s working			0
then , in the evening , once the children are in bed , i head off to work as a stand - up comic and spend the mornings before the children wake focusing on my writing			0
for the moment , our children still like us , and it ’s only for a relatively small amount of time that we can maintain such a central roles in their lives			0
soon enough , they ’ll be in school and their peers will be the ones having that impact — but on foundations my wife and i have laid down during these precious first few years			0
the first person who ’d agree with this new way of doing things is my mum			0
when she comes to visit us , she transforms from business supremo to building blocks supremo			1
she still works hard , but there ’s now a job she relishes most of all			0
the job of being grandma .			0
