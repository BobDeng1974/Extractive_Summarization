by @entity1 reporter and @entity2 and @entity3 mattresses , portable toilets and showers were brought in saturday for 700 unaccompanied minors who spent the night sleeping on plastic cots inside an @entity11 warehouse , a federal official said			1
a homeland security official told @entity1 that about 2,000 mattresses have been ordered to the makeshift holding center — a warehouse that has not been used to house people in years			1
gov. @entity18 's spokesman , @entity17 , said friday that conditions at the center are so dire that federal officials have asked the state to immediately ship medical supplies to the center in @entity25			1
overflowing : the shelter at @entity27 in @entity28 can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids , forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to @entity25 for processing the @entity37 @entity36 started flying immigrants to @entity11 from the @entity39 in @entity28 last month after the number of immigrants — including more than 48,000 children traveling on their own — overwhelmed the @entity43 there			1
immigrant families were flown from @entity28 , released in @entity11 , and told to report to an @entity46 ( @entity46 ) office near where they were traveling within 15 days			1
@entity46 has said the immigrants were mostly families from @entity49 fleeing extreme poverty and violence			1
the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no authorization to discuss the matter publicly , said the holding center opened for unaccompanied children because the @entity37 @entity60 had nowhere to turn			2
' they became so overwhelmed and have n't kept up with planning , ' the official said			0
at the holding center , vendors are being contracted to provide nutritional meals , according to @entity67 officials			0
the @entity68 , meanwhile , will provide counseling services and recreational activities			0
hundreds of immigrants believed to be in the country illegally from @entity49 and @entity73 being held in crowded concrete rooms similar to a jail cell the homeland security official said the number of children at the warehouse was expected to double to around 1,400			1
the warehouse has a capacity of about 1,500			0
the warehouse began housing children flown from @entity28 last saturday			1
about 400 were scheduled to arrive friday but , because of mechanical issues with the planes , only about 60 came , the @entity36 official said			0
saturday 's flights were canceled , also because of mechanical problems			0
there are flights scheduled through mid-june			0
federal authorities plan to use the @entity25 facility as a way station , where the children will be vaccinated and checked medically			1
they will then be sent to facilities being set up in @entity95 , @entity96 ; @entity97 , @entity28 ; and @entity98 , @entity99			2
@entity17 said reports from consulates that the @entity36 was stopping the program to fly migrant families to @entity11 and then bus them to @entity105 were incorrect			2
instead , the program that has shipped unknown thousands of adult migrants and their children to @entity11 since last month shows no sign of stopping , he said			2
' the adults , the adults with children , families — that continues unfettered and we have no idea where they are going , ' @entity17 said			0
in a statement friday , @entity36 officials said " appropriate custody determinations will be made on a case by case basis " for migrants apprehended in @entity28			2
many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger @entity27 has become a temporary shelter for youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone @entity18 sent an angry letter to president @entity129 on monday demanding that the program of dropping off families at bus stations in @entity105 stop immediately			1
she called the program dangerous and unconscionable , asked for details and demanded to know why state authorities were n't consulted or even informed			1
the governor said she had n't received a response to her letter by friday			2
' i have reached out to federal homeland security director @entity141 for answers			0
meanwhile , i reiterate my call on president @entity129 to secure our southern border and terminate this operation immediately , ' @entity18 said in a statement			1
@entity18 's staff spent friday in a series of calls with officials from @entity68 , @entity46 and @entity36			1
@entity17 said @entity68 's region 9 administrator was being sent to the holding center in @entity25 on saturday to oversee efforts to deal with the hundreds of arriving children			2
the federal emergency supplies are held in @entity11 warehouses , and @entity17 said the state is working to send them to the holding center			1
@entity49 has been left astounded by the shocking conditions these children have been kept in - conditions so dire that border control agents fear the spread of disease about 850 that were being housed at the facility have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor on friday night , the @entity37 @entity172 announced that young lawyers and paralegals are being sought for the community service program @entity176 to provide legal assistance in immigration proceedings to children who come to the @entity37 illegally			1
officials say about 100 lawyers and paralegals will be enrolled as members of @entity176 in a new division called ' justice americorps			0
' immigration officials can immediately return @entity191 immigrants to the border , but they are much more hard - pressed to deal with @entity49 migrants who illegally cross into the @entity37 in recent months , waves of migrants from nations south of @entity73 have arrived in @entity28			1
the homeland security official said that legally , only their parents or guardians can take custody if the government makes the children eligible for release			2
officials in @entity49 and @entity73 have noticed a recent increase in women and children crossing the border			2
father @entity206 , the director of a migrant shelter in @entity208 in the southern @entity73 state of @entity210 , said he and others advise children that it 's too dangerous			2
yet @entity206 is seeing more and more youths heading north			0
' i remember a little boy of 9 years old and i asked if he was going to go meet someone and he told me " no , i 'm just going hand myself over because i hear they help kids , " ' @entity206 said			0
the perception that some immigrants could be getting a free pass into the @entity37 could lead to more attempts to cross the border			1
president @entity129 said the sharp influx of unaccompanied children from @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 was an ' urgent humanitarian situation ' more than 33,000 minors were apprehended in the @entity39 of @entity28 since october last year , it has been reported illegal immigration increased heavily under a ' catch - and - release ' strategy during the @entity237 administration			1
under that policy the government issued notices to appear in immigration court to migrants from countries other than @entity73 until @entity237 stopped the practice			0
federal officials then established a 210 - mile stretch of the @entity73 border as a zero - tolerance zone for illegal immigration			0
instead of merely getting sent back home , migrants were arrested , prosecuted and sometimes sentenced to prison before being formally kicked out of the country			0
by august 2006 , border agents in the @entity255 , @entity28 , sector said daily arrests had dropped from 500 to fewer than 100			2
the half - century - old section of a @entity37 air force base in @entity28 has been transformed into a holding and processing center for thousands of children illegally crossing the border from @entity49 and @entity264 without adults			1
leaked photos from the base obtained by @entity268 show hundreds of children holed up in crowded concrete rooms , many of them sleeping on the bare floor without blankets or pillows			0
among those children are @entity277 , 12 , who came from @entity227 to the @entity37 and now rests on a bunk at @entity27 in @entity97 under a hand - drawn flag of his native country and a message cheering the @entity227 squad in the upcoming soccer @entity284			1
@entity277 is one of the 60,000 ' unaccompanied minors ' - children under 18 - that the @entity129 administration estimates will enter the @entity37 illegally this year			1
it projects that number to grow to nearly 130,000 next year , creating what the @entity290 describes as an ' urgent humanitarian situation '			1
at the base , children are provided with three hot meals and two snacks a day			0
they can call home twice a week			0
they have access to mental health clinicians and on - site medical care the minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in @entity73 and other parts of @entity49 such as @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 nearly 1,000 of the minors at a time are being sheltered at a facility built about 50 years ago to house new recruits for basic training			1
the boys and girls will pass along corridors with faded @entity317 pictures and new signs written in @entity319 that point the way to the dining hall and bathrooms			0
since the facility opened three weeks ago , 1,820 children have passed through the center			0
about 850 have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor , said @entity37 @entity60 spokesman @entity328			0
the person who takes the child , @entity328 says , has to agree to bring the child to an immigration hearing			0
the minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in @entity73 and other parts of @entity49 such as @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229			1
they are sometimes seeking to reunite with a parent who is already in the @entity37 , also without documentation			0
another facility for minors will open at @entity342 in @entity96 that will hold a maximum of 600 children			0
at @entity27 , the children between the ages of 12 and 17 are handed several sheets and towels when they arrive and checked for lice and scabies			2
@entity351 blame president @entity129 for the situation , pointing to his 2012 policy that sent a message of hope to kids yearning to stay in the @entity37 photos leaked thursday from a @entity37 @entity43 facility in the @entity39 show overflowing holding facilities of immigrants , many of whom are children over 400 children a day are coming and as many as 60,000 will cross the @entity191 border illegally this year they then undergo physical and mental health evaluations , and are assigned a metal bunk from among the rows that line the walls of large barracks - style rooms			1
there is little need for storage because , as social workers put it , few of these children arrived with anything other than the clothes they wore on their journey north			0
the administration estimates it costs taxpayers $ 252 per child per day			0
' the reasons , as we understand them , that contribute to this dramatic increase have to do with economic conditions in those countries , sustained violence in these countries , and the desire of these children to be reunited with family members in the @entity37 , ' @entity397 , the @entity396 said .			2
