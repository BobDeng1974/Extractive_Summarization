her remarkably smooth skin and taut complexion has already attracted plenty of attention			0
but yesterday it was @entity7 ’s eyebrows that were , well , raising eyebrows			1
gone were the wispy blonde strands that once framed her eyes – and in their place were darker , well - defined arches that helped make the 43 - year - old look more youthful than ever as she arrived to begin auditions for this year ’s series of @entity15 ’s @entity14			2
her secret ? it appears miss @entity23 is now a devotee of @entity26 , the £ 40 once - a - month treatment also beloved of celebrities including fellow @entity15 ’s @entity14 judge @entity29 , singer @entity30 and @entity32 star @entity31			1
launched by beauty specialist @entity49 , it includes treatment to stimulate hair growth , followed by colouring , shaping and applying make - up to give a dramatic finish			2
the number of treatments needed to achieve the desired look varies , but upkeep sessions are recommended every four to six weeks			0
last night a source close to miss @entity7 said : ‘ @entity7 has let her eyebrows grow and has a brow shaping treatment called @entity63 by @entity49 [ @entity49 ] at @entity64			1
’ @entity7 has a sleek new look with hair worn long and straight , strong brows and red lipstick @entity69 , an @entity70 specialist who works at @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , said : ‘ the look that @entity26 gives you is very symmetrical and measured so it looks great on camera			1
‘ it ’s the combination of all seven steps that gives you a really crisp and sharp outline			0
’ the seven - step process starts with a consultation , at which clients may be given a daily cream to stimulate hair growth			0
the second step is the application of an eyebrow tint and the third is to design the desired shape of the brows			2
@entity7 's brows are considerably thicker than they were before , they also appear to be darker thanks to the £ 40 - a - month treatment in the fourth step , the desired shape is created by waxing ; in the fifth , the eyebrows are threaded to remove any fine hairs that escaped the wax ; and in the sixth , tweezers are used to pluck any remaining hairs and give a sharp , precise finish			1
the final step is to add liner and powder to make the brows bolder and fill in any gaps			0
mother of two miss @entity23 has previously admitted to using @entity112 to smooth her skin , but has since said she has stopped .			0

@entity7 showed off darker brows on the red carpet
@entity118 can reveal she has been having @entity26 treatment
sources say she had to grow her brows out before filling them in
