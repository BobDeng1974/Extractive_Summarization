@entity1 's estranged wife issued a strong statement against his racist recordings but new court records have revealed that she also has a history of making incendiary comments about minorities			1
@entity9 ' @entity8 has been legally married to the @entity11 owner since 1955 though they have long been described as being separated and estranged			1
court documents discovered by the @entity16 names @entity17 as part of a discrimination lawsuit filed against the couple by their former tenants , with one @entity24 resident claiming that she called him a ' black motherf * * * * * ' during an argument			1
estranged but connected : @entity1 's comments got him banned from the @entity29 but his wife @entity17 - the couple is separated - has also been noted as making racist remarks in earlier lawsuits ' i asked her again , i asked her , " would you reduce the rent ? " ' and she said , ‘ who do you think you are , you black motherf * * * * * , ' tenant @entity40 said in the 2009 deposition			1
' the way in which she said motherf * * * * * was more lower voiced , under her breath			1
she said black loud enough for me to hear , she said mother loud enough for me to hear			0
@entity48 — part was a little lower			0
i had to look at her lips to hear her say it			0
' still allowed in : @entity17 was seen cheering on the @entity11 when they won against the @entity54 on tuesday night , just hours after @entity1 had been banned indefinitely from the @entity29 the incident with mr @entity40 , which was a part of a larger discrimination case that ended in @entity57 paying a $ 2.75million settlement to the @entity59 , was not the only one that suggests mrs @entity8 's personal beliefs are rather in line with that of her husband			1
one of the on - site property managers that the @entity57 employed said in a deposition how @entity17 complained about how her minority tenants kept the apartments from staying clean			1
' she said , " oh , my @entity70			0
i ca n’t remodel my apartments the way that i want because @entity75 are so filthy , " ' manager @entity72 said of @entity17			1
when asked for clarification about the exact phrasing , ms @entity72 recalled @entity17 saying : ' i ca n’t remodel my building the way i want and that the building was filthy because of the @entity75			2
' mrs @entity8 's actions were at the center of an earlier court case , when a different property supervisor accused @entity17 of sneaking her way into tenant 's apartments by claiming to be a health inspector			1
' @entity89 declares that when she worked for @entity1 she often accompanied @entity90 on apartment inspections , that @entity90 would regularly pose as a government official in order to gain access to tenants ’ apartments , ' a court order obtained by the @entity16 reads			2
the judge reportedly called the accusations ' troubling ' but found insufficient evidence to try the case , leading to an out of court settlement with the @entity104			0
though her husband has been issued a lifetime ban from the @entity29 and ordered to pay a $ 2.5million fine , @entity17 still has a number of supporters within the basketball family			2
the @entity112 's coach @entity111 told @entity113 that he spoke to @entity17 on tuesday and ' she has been through as much as anyone as well '			2
hurtful words : @entity17 ( pictured here on sunday ) was listed as making derogatory remarks about black and @entity119 tenants in the mid-to - late 2000s times of need : @entity17 was seen going to dinner sunday with her estranged husband just hours after releasing a statement condemning his racist recording ' it ’s a tough one for @entity17 , really , ' @entity126 said following the team 's victory against the @entity54 on tuesday			1
“ ' she did n’t do anything wrong either			0
you have compassion for her			0
i kept hearing about the girlfriend			0
i kept thinking , " @entity17 is the wife			2
" you know what i mean ? ' that sentiment was echoed by former @entity11 star @entity140 who played for the @entity142 team under the @entity57 ’s purview for five years before leaving in 1994			2
' the only bad part is i know how much his wife loves the team and mostly i feel sad for her , ’ @entity140 told the @entity147			0
' when i was there she was very good and kind to me ... i was at a game last year , sat down and ate with her			0
she loves the team and the sport and loves basketball			0
she knows what ’s going on			0
it ’s probably going to hurt her more than him			0
the other woman : @entity17 is in the midst of a lawsuit against her estranged husband 's girlfriend @entity161 ( left ) , who is the woman on the other end of the racist recording ' the only way any of those sponsors are going to return is if they sell that team			1
if he transfers the power over to her , it still feels like he owns that team			0
' while @entity1 has been banned from attending any @entity29 games or stepping foot in any facility associated with the @entity11 , the same ban has not been extended to his wife			1
she was seen at the tuesday night game and took a seat in the lower bowl area - as opposed to her normal courtside seat			2
she was wearing head - to - toe black which is believed to be in support of the player who have been wearing black socks and armbands since the racist recording was released saturday morning .			1

*disgraced* @entity11 owner @entity1 's wife has an alleged history of making racist comments as well
court documents from discrimination suits cite two instances where @entity17 said derogatory things about minority tenants in properties her family own
called an @entity24 tenant a ' black motherf * * * * * ' and said that @entity75 ' are so filthy '
even lied and said she was a health inspector to sneak into apartments
she immediately condemned her estranged husband 's racist recording sunday *afternoon* but was *spotted* at dinner with him sunday night
unlike her husband , she has not been banned from being involved with the team , and went to support them at their playoff game tuesday
