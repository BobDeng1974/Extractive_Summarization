police in @entity7 , @entity3 are looking for the owner of a truck made out of a cut up mini bus and a storage unit similar to the temporary buildings found on construction sites			2
the unusual motor was abandoned in the town centre weeks ago and has yet to be claimed			0
mystery truck : the abandoned lorry - like vehicle appears to have been made from a separate storage unit and a cab cut into a tiny drivers space the truck has no seats or doors , and how the driver is meant to fit in between the wheel and the storage unit is still a mystery			2
as there is nowhere to sit , it seems the driver would be forced to steer from beside the wheel , or open what appears to be a door on the misfitting storage unit			0
police in the southwest city of @entity7 first received reports about the bizarre truck a few weeks ago but no owner has yet to come forward			0
cramped : the truck has no doors , no seats and how a driver is supposed to fit in between the storage and the wheel remains a mystery left to rust : the vehicle was found abandoned in @entity7 , @entity3 where police are now attempting to track down the owner mismatched : the storage space resembles temporary construction site huts which appears to have been attacked to a cut - up mini bus			1
