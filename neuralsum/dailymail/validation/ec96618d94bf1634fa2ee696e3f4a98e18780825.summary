@entity0 wants his fringe players to prove a point to him in @entity3 as he prepares to field an ' experimental ' line - up against @entity5			1
@entity7 's confidence is running high after they thumped @entity8 4 - 0 on friday to stretch their @entity10 winning streak to seven matches			1
they know a much stiffer test lies around the corner though			0
@entity5 find themselves in the midst of a crisis after coach @entity18 received death threats from angry @entity21 fans who blame him for causing @entity22 to break down with a serious knee injury			2
@entity7 boss @entity0 will change up his starting xi for the friendly against @entity5 on tuesday night the @entity5 are also without experienced campaigners @entity27 and @entity28 , but they are still by far the toughest opposition @entity7 have faced since their winless and joyless campaign in @entity31			1
@entity0 's plans have been turned completely upside down after nine squad withdrawals , though			2
the likes of @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 are likely to get a chance in @entity3 and with competition for places increasing , particularly in midfield and attack , @entity0 wants to see encouraging signs from those who step in			1
' we 've got a tougher test ahead of us against @entity5 and we will be playing that game with players we would n't normally rely upon , ' the @entity7 manager told @entity52			1
@entity7 fringe players will get a chance to impress manager @entity0 during a friendly in @entity3 ' there are an awful lot of people in the squad i count on that we 've lost , but what it means is for those who are still with us , many who are relatively untried , there will be a chance for them to show that my faith in selecting them for this squad was justified			1
' @entity0 confirmed on saturday that @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 would all return to their clubs			0
@entity79 full - back @entity77 is the only replacement so @entity0 now has 20 players - including three goalkeepers - to choose from			2
those left are an inexperienced bunch			0
eight players have 10 caps or less			0
@entity87 forward @entity38 , who was a second - half substitute against @entity8 , could start on tuesday @entity7 duo @entity88 ( left ) and @entity71 ( right ) celebrate their strikes on friday night @entity90 midfielder @entity39 runs with possession during a late cameo on friday in the @entity8 match in a bid , perhaps , to dampen expectations running high following @entity96 's impressive debut on friday , @entity0 was moved to describe his line - up as ' experimental ' on sunday			1
the @entity7 manager says his team should not be judged on the result of tuesday 's game at the @entity103 , but later in the season when they are expected to play big friendlies against the likes of @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			2
' the real test against tougher opposition will be when the qualifying campaign is over , ' the 67 - year - old said			0
' when the qualifying campaign ends - we believe we 'll be qualified in october - then we have two very important friendlies in november , two important friendlies in march , certainly in may			0
' hopefully we 'll get really quality opposition to play us in those matches which will really put us seriously to the test			0
@entity96 celebrates scoring on debut as @entity7 cruise to a 4 - 0 victory over @entity124 on friday night ' there are a number of players who quite seriously believe they should be in the team and none of them will be in @entity5			1
' @entity5 and @entity130 ( in june ) will be to some extent experimental and a chance to break in to what we think is our best xi. ' still , a win against the nation that beat them in their @entity140 opener last summer will do no harm to morale , especially if @entity96 puts on another performance like the one that saw him score after just 79 seconds on the pitch on friday			1
for @entity0 it will be the first time he has visited the new @entity103			0
@entity5 striker @entity148 ( left ) celebrates scoring a late equaliser against @entity150 with coach @entity18 he did not enjoy that much success at the @entity21 's former ground , the @entity153 , when he was in charge at @entity155 , mainly because he always came up against a team containing the likes of @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			2
@entity0 lost twice in the league at @entity21 , but a 3 - 0 @entity163 win over the @entity3 giants is still remembered fondly by @entity155 fans			1
' i did n't have many happy moments in @entity3 , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity21 were clearly the best team in the country during my time with many , many star players			0
' apart from one cup victory which we had there , invariably we did n't get the results we wanted			0
' but i 'm happy to be going back to @entity5 as a country and i 'm happy to be playing @entity5 again			0

@entity7 beat @entity8 4 - 0 in @entity177 qualifier on friday at @entity178
@entity96 scored 79 seconds after coming on during his @entity7 debut
