@entity0 should have been happy			1
he had just scored a match - winning double on his debut for @entity4			1
the @entity6 franchise had been so fixated on signing him that basketball star @entity8 and rapper @entity9 were employed as part of the charm offensive			0
but even then , on that march afternoon last year in @entity13 , it was evident that all was not well with @entity0 , at least to those who were in the post-match locker - room at @entity16			1
@entity0 's time at @entity4 was hampered by injury , ruling him out of 12 of their final 18 games @entity0 has been offered an escape route from @entity22 with @entity23 @entity0 ( right ) beats a tackle from @entity25 ( left ) to score on his @entity4 debut against @entity27 @entity0 was mobbed by reporters in the locker room after his first game for the club @entity0 has scored on his debut for all his clubs : sep 2000 @entity35 0 - 1 @entity34 oct 2000 @entity36 2 - 1 @entity38 @entity37 feb 2004 @entity40 4 - 3 @entity39 feb 2008 @entity39 1 - 1 @entity41 mar 2014 @entity27 1 - 2 @entity6 can @entity0 continue his scoring spree when he takes on former club @entity40 on saturday ? within 10 minutes of full - time , nearly 50 reporters had invaded the changing quarters , all demanding his time and attention			1
@entity0 ’s face , it is said , told its own story			1
‘ he had a look of , “ what the hell is going on here ? ” , ’ a source close to the club told @entity53			0
‘ even then we thought he was n’t happy and had not settled			0
but looking back , that game was the highlight of his time here and probably of the franchise ’s history			1
’ @entity0 had been sold a vision of @entity4 by @entity65 , the president of @entity66 ( @entity66 ) — the company which owns the football team and the man who became so obsessed with bringing the @entity70 international to @entity22 that a deal which would ultimately cost $ 50million was sanctioned			1
@entity9 and @entity73 star @entity8 were tasked with wooing @entity0 's mum , @entity74 @entity0 poses with his mum at his 23rd birthday in @entity77 back in 2005 @entity8 was asked by @entity65 , when the @entity73 star was playing in @entity4 , to woo @entity0 ’s mum @entity74 as she attended a basketball game as a courtside guest of the club in november 2013			1
@entity9 , meanwhile , sent flowers to her hotel — the @entity84 , no less — and later telephoned @entity0			1
in january , @entity0 was unveiled as the poster - boy for the franchise			1
@entity66 made sure his face was on every prominent billboard across town			0
what they failed to mention was that @entity4 are the fourth , possibly fifth , most significant sports team in the city			2
‘ we do n’t think he was prepared for that , ’ added the source			0
‘ he was sold this idea that he was going to be like a rock star			0
but i do n’t think he realised how small the club is			0
‘ in a city of nearly three - million people , there is a cult - like group of about 40,000 who care about @entity4 and about 20,000 go to matches			2
the majority are ice - hockey fans			0
we think @entity0 was brutally homesick from the start			2
after a few months he was pushing for a move back to @entity70			2
in the end it was inevitable and everyone is relieved it ’s finally all over			0
’ @entity0 was the star attraction for @entity4 following his big - money move to @entity22 @entity0 was unveiled alongside @entity118 international @entity117 in january 2014 although the relationship was on rocky ground from the start , he did score 11 times in the first 16 games of the campaign			1
but amid that scoring streak came his omission from @entity129 ’s @entity70 @entity128 squad			0
@entity0 was convinced he would be in @entity130 and it is thought that snub marked @entity133 of his time in the @entity6			1
he scored his last goal for @entity4 in a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity138 on july 16 before injuries — some disputed by the club and supporters — saw him miss 12 of the final 18 matches			1
he was hurt when his commitment was questioned			0
‘ there are a few fans who have said certain things and i ’m like , “ well , that ’s a bit harsh ” , ’ he said in october			0
@entity0 received stick from some supporters , who questioned some of his injury problems ‘ if you want someone to stay at a football club , at least support them			1
at least show them that you want them to be here			0
’ two months earlier , head coach @entity159 — @entity0 ’s former @entity40 team - mate — had been sacked			1
@entity0 ’s own exit plan was in place and he came close to a move back to the @entity164 in the summer			1
he eventually returned to the @entity165 in november and has spent time training at @entity167 and in @entity168 , as well as with @entity40 ’ development squad			0
the 32 - year - old never had any intention of returning to the @entity6 and will today be confirmed as a @entity23 player , with @entity118 striker @entity173 set to go in the other direction			1
@entity175 has given @entity0 a way out from his sorry spell with @entity4 the @entity178 , meanwhile , is also home to @entity179 , the former @entity4 boss now in caretaker charge of @entity181			1
and he is surprised that @entity0 quit after just one season			2
‘ i ca n’t believe he has n’t settled in @entity4 because it is a fantastic party city			2
i loved it , ’ he said			0
‘ i know he did extremely well on the pitch but i also know he had a problem settling			0
but he could have been the big star of the @entity6			0
if he had stayed fit , he might have got @entity4 into the play - offs			2
@entity23 have got a good deal			2
’ @entity192 boss @entity191 agrees			0
‘ we tried to get @entity0 , ’ he revealed			2
‘ but we were probably a bit late in the loop			0
he ’ll do well for @entity23			0
’ now he ’s at the @entity196 — earning a handsome £ 80,000 a week and under the care of friend @entity175 — perhaps @entity0 will finally find happiness , as well as the back of the net .			1
