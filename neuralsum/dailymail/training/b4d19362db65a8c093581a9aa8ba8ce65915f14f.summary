click here to read @entity2 's match report from @entity3 @entity4 blamed end - of - season rust for the 90th - minute goal which sealed a nightmare evening for @entity8 and denied @entity9 the scalp of @entity13 qualifiers @entity11			1
leading 2 - 1 with seconds to play , his team looked certain to make it six wins in their last nine games after an outrageous goal from @entity20 and a second - half own goal from @entity22			1
on a night to forget for @entity8 at @entity25 ’s @entity3 , however , @entity24 ’s first - half equaliser took a wicked deflection off the centre - half – before he failed to clear his lines as substitute @entity29 levelled in injury time			1
bullish mood : @entity4 was pleased with @entity9 's attacking display against @entity11 @entity33 : @entity9 players celebrate @entity20 's opening goal ‘ i liked a lot of things i saw there , the only thing we had a problem with was the fact some of the lads had not trained for three weeks , ’ said @entity4 , indicating that weariness was the only difference between a win and a draw			1
‘ most of them had been on holiday somewhere			1
i ’m not saying they were n’t looking after themselves , and the way they tried to switch on again at training was terrific			1
but we lost a wee bit of fitness in the last 15 minutes			1
' during the game , we were one pass away from a really great move			1
we could have had four or five goals			2
that ’s the first time i ’ve said that after a game - we had a lot of chances			1
‘ i ’d put the fact we did n’t finish them off down to rustiness			2
in terms of what i saw and what we are trying do , in terms of movement and trying to get closer to the striker , i liked that			2
tussle : @entity11 's @entity77 keeps @entity78 at arms length ' the shape we had when we did n’t have the ball was good as well			2
’ @entity9 took the lead through an outrageous and audacious @entity88 effort , the @entity83 star flicking out a heel to deflect a @entity85 shot into the net			2
‘ @entity20 ’s goal was terrific			2
it was luck in terms of the shot but he had to know where to send it , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ there is a lot to be proud of , i ’m just disappointed we did n’t get the win			2
’ @entity4 admitted @entity8 was disappointed with his failure to clear his lines for the last - gasp equaliser			1
leveller : @entity24 watches on as his strike finds the back of the net adamant the @entity107 had no failures , however , the @entity9 boss also blooded @entity110 ’s @entity109 for the first time as a second half substitute			2
‘ the first @entity11 goal was unlucky for us			0
the ricochet might go in itself			0
but i thought @entity8 was terrific , ’ he said			0
‘ nobody has disappointed me			0
@entity109 gave us a new dimension			0
midfielders like it when the ball goes up to someone like that			0
it ’s a new thing in football - the strikers are not scoring 40 or 50 goals a season			1
they score 20 or so but have to link up and let others score , too			0
he is good that way			0
dejected : @entity8 struggles to hide his disappointment comeback kids : @entity11 celebrate snatching a draw late on to deny @entity9 ‘ in terms of positive play , that ’s as good as it gets			1
we have been terrific as a unit before and had a few chances , but overall there was a bit of flair and imagination against a really top side			0
‘ @entity146 and @entity147 ( @entity148 ) were terrific down that left side			0
with hardly any caps between them , they ’re not physically big but they stood up and played the game			0
they did n’t let them get close to them			0
‘ @entity159 is terrific , a breath of fresh air			0
he radiates on the pitch and in the dressing room			0
that ’s all you can ask for			0
’ speaking out : a @entity11 fan hits back at claims of match - fixing prior to wednesday 's friendly			1
