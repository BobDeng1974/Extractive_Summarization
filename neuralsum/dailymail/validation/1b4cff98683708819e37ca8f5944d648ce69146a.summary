militant union boss @entity0 has warned that his activists will break the law if the @entity3 curb the right to strike after the election			2
in an extraordinary move , which was condemned by ministers , the @entity7 general - secretary said he was seeking to change the giant union ’s constitution to authorise illegal action			1
mr @entity0 , whose union has given @entity14 more than £ 14 million , said union members could not be expected to obey ‘ oppressive ’ laws that restrict the right to strike			1
unite general - secretary @entity0 said he was seeking to change the giant union ’s constitution to authorise illegal action the @entity18 have said they will change the law to require unions to get the support of at least 40 per cent of their members before calling a strike			1
the initiative is designed to prevent union bosses ordering strikes on the basis of ballots in which only a tiny number of members have voted			0
mr @entity0 said the right to strike was already ‘ hanging by a thread ’ as a result of union reforms carried out by the @entity37			1
in a move that suggests he has little confidence in a @entity41 victory , mr @entity0 said @entity7 members would now be asked to vote to remove the words ‘ so far as may be lawful ’ from the rules governing the union 's actions			1
in a speech to lawyers , mr @entity49 said : ‘ these words will go not because we are anarchists , not because we are suddenly planning a bank robbery - but because we have to ask ourselves the question , can we any longer make that commitment to , under any and all circumstances , stick within the law as it stands ? mr @entity0 , whose union has given @entity14 more than £ 14 million ‘ it is no exaggeration to say that the right to strike in this - the first country of free trade unionism - was and is hanging by a thread			1
‘ but should there be a @entity66 majority in may , there will be a new attack on trade union rights and democracy			0
‘ the bar for a strike ballot will be raised to a level which hardly any mps would get over in their own constituencies , by a government which has refused our requests to use modern , more effective balloting methods			0
‘ when the law is misguided , when it oppresses the people and removes their freedoms , can we respect it ? i am not really posing the question			0
i 'm giving you the answer			0
it ai n't going to happen			0
’ cabinet office minister @entity87 condemned the move – and said it would raise further concerns @entity7 ’s planned ‘ merger ’ with the pcs union			0
mr @entity87 said : ‘ @entity41 's biggest donor and @entity14 's puppet master is now advocating that their membership break the law			2
@entity14 needs to immediately condemn this outrageous proposal and refuse to take a penny more from @entity7 until these plans are cancelled			0
’ @entity66 mp @entity100 said it was ‘ shocking ’ for a union leader to call for illegal action – and called on mr @entity14 to disown the move			1
mr @entity100 , who has campaigned for the introduction of minimum strike thresholds , said : ‘ @entity106 has never managed to persuade even a quarter of @entity7 members to back even one of his reckless public sector strikes since 2010 , but it 's still shocking to hear him preparing to break the law			2
@entity14 has taken millions from this union bully since becoming @entity41 leader , so if he now fails to condemn this threat of illegal strikes , it will just show the public what a weak leader he is			2
’ unite activists will decide on the change of wording to the union 's rules at a conference later in the year			1
the @entity41 declined to comment .			0
