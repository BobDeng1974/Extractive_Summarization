nothing encourages forgiveness quite like a bouquet of flowers			1
and even the taxman , it seems , likes to say sorry with floral arrangements when he gets his sums mixed up			0
according to figures released by @entity11 and @entity12 , public money was used to fund more than 100 bouquets for customers handed incorrect demands over the past five years			1
officials later agreed with her that the amount was incorrect , and dispatched a revised bill of £ 17,000 along with a bouquet of flowers			1
she said : ‘ i was really , really traumatised by getting that demand			0
it nearly killed me thinking i owed £ 1billion			1
i was new to business and naïve			0
’ mrs @entity19 , 60 , said it was ‘ insulting ’ that the taxman thought he could compensate her for the trauma of being handed such a massive demand with a cheap bunch of flowers			1
‘ when the flowers came they did n’t even have a note saying who they were from , ’ she said			0
‘ i only realised they were from the taxman when a letter came afterwards apologising and saying they had sent some flowers			0
‘ they ca n’t have cost them much more than £ 10			0
it ’s insulting for them to use taxpayer ’s money to say sorry for their own mistakes			0
’ officials later agreed with her that the bill of nearly £ 1billion ( left ) was incorrect , and dispatched a revised bill ( right ) of £ 17,000 along with a bouquet of flowers mrs @entity19 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , works six days a week to keep her café , @entity22 ’s , in @entity69 , afloat			1
she said she is still trying to pay off the revised £ 17,000 tax bill in small instalments nearly two years later			1
she received a vat bill for £ 979,092,858 in march 2013			2
the letter , signed by an @entity75 debt collector , said : ‘ if you do not pay or contact us , we can visit your premises in order to arrange for your assets to be sold by public auction			2
’ @entity75 said it could not provide the cost of the 106 bouquets sent to customers between january 1 , 2009 and july 1 , 2014 , but said it stuck to strict guidelines on spending public money			1
a spokesman for @entity75 said : ‘ when we let a customer down , we always apologise and put matters right			2
and occasionally , having considered the specific details of a customer ’s complaint , we do send flowers , but only where we consider this is the most appropriate way of saying “ sorry ”			0
’ @entity97 , chief executive of the @entity98 ’ @entity100 campaign group , said the idea that flowers could compensate for the stress and worry caused by @entity75 errors was ‘ ludicrous			2
’ he added : ‘ rather than receiving crushed carnations in the post , taxpayers would prefer the taxman to simply get their maths right in the first place			0
