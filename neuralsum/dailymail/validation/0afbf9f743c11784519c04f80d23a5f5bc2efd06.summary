@entity0 , who has been arrested for a raping a woman at gunpoint after a rape kit from 2000 was finally tested police in @entity5 have identified 25 rape suspects after finally testing evidence kits that had been forgotten about for 40 years			1
some rape victims have sued the city , alleging that the failure to test around 12,000 kits , some dating back to the 1970s , has allowed too many rapists to escape prosecution			1
the kits contain samples of semen , saliva and blood taken from a victim , with the dna then uploaded to the @entity23 's @entity22 to check for a match			2
now it has been revealed that the backlog , which is now being cleared , has identified 25 suspected rapists with 16 of them believed to have assaulted multiple victims			1
@entity30 lieutenant @entity29 also confirmed that 5,386 kits had now been sent for testing and that 58 cases have been sent to prosecutors for indictment			0

in a report about the kit testing backlog last year , former @entity59 attorney @entity58 said nobody maliciously or wantonly allowed the kits to remain untested			2
