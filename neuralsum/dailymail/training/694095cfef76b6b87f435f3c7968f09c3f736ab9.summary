by @entity0 published : 13:15 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 13:15 est , 17 february 2013 the @entity1 has been cancelled for the second year in row so the grass on the original battlefield can grow back			2
last year the annual re-enactment of the famous 1066 battle - which attracts up to 2,400 participants , including archers , foot soldiers and cavalry - was cancelled for health and safety reasons because of ' deep mud '			1
and this year 's event due to be held in october has already been called off by bosses at @entity16 so the grass can grow back at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			1
the historical re-enactment has been cancelled this year so the grass at the famous site can grow back a spokesman for @entity16 said it had no choice but to cancel the event - which attracts huge crowds of up to 30,000 and participants in full armour , shields , swords and maces - because the grass needed to be re-seeded			1
locals , however , are fuming as the annual event is important to the local economy			1
one businessman , who runs a hotel , said last week : ' it looks like we wo n't be fully booked like we have been in the past			0
' we can normally count on all the rooms being taken during the re-enactment , but now for two years in a row we 'll probably have 15 empty rooms			0
' local @entity46 , 43 , said : ' i do n't imagine for one minute that the battlefield in 1066 was like the @entity50 pitch , so if they want a " real " re-enactment then what better than a giant mud bath			2
' last year it was cancelled for health and safety reasons because of a bit of mud and this year it 's been cancelled again because they want it looking like a football pitch			2
' a spokesman for @entity16 said : ' extreme weather conditions in 2012 took their toll on the historic battlefield [ and ] as a @entity69 under the protection and guardianship of @entity16 , its conservation takes top priority and its management has to be handled in a way which reflects the sensitive nature of the site			0
it is the second year in a row the event has been cancelled leaving businesses out of pocket @entity82 to 30,000 people a year visit the area to watch the re-enactment ' on expert advice , it has been decided the area needs to be re-seeded and rested to enable it to fully recover and establish a more robust grass surface			1
' this action will help us to balance the best management of this iconic battlefield , given the potential impact changes in weather patterns are likely to have , with our underlying wish to continue staging events which so graphically illustrate this key event in our history			0
' the famous battle saw victory for the @entity103 after they defeated the @entity106 army under @entity107 the 947th anniversary will now be marked by a ' theatrical re-telling ' of the event , rather than a full - on battle			0
the @entity16 spokesman added : ' although we appreciate that many people will be disappointed , we hope the events we are staging in other parts of the site this year will be enjoyed by thousands of @entity18 visitors and that by taking this action now , we will be able to safeguard large scale events in the future , with the aim to reinstate them from 2014			1
' last year the battle was cancelled by @entity16 due to health and safety reasons after torrential rain turned the battlefield into a mud bath			2
a spokesman said at the time : ' although the forecast was for fair weather , unexpected torrential rain over several hours has resulted in unacceptably high levels of mud both on the battlefield and on public areas			0
' for safety reasons , the event can not go ahead			0

@entity16 said the event had to be cancelled to conserve the site
last year 's event was also cancelled because the mud was too deep
local businesses are angry about impact of cancellation on local economy
the re-enactment attracts up to 30,000 visitors and 2,400 participants
