by @entity1 reporter published : 14:18 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 16:00 est , 11 april 2012 cornish mps from all three major political parties could be set to form a coalition of their own to prevent the government getting its controversial ' pasty tax ' plan past @entity8 , it emerged today			1
@entity10 @entity9 said the six @entity3 would look to build a coalition of its own from @entity13 and other disgruntled @entity14 - @entity10 and @entity15 - across the country opposed to @entity18 ’s budget plan to make pasties and other hot baked foods subject to vat			1
speaking at a @entity22 in @entity23 , which brought together pasty producers and politicians , the mp for @entity27 and @entity28 said that there was opposition to the plan from across the country from the @entity3 countryside to ' meat and potato pie ' constituencies in the north of @entity37			1
hot food tax : pasties that are sold hot in shops will have to charge the 20 per cent sales tax he said that the @entity43 was already adopting a ' bunker mentality ' over the pasty tax and there was a chance that the legislation would either be defeated or that enough pressure could be brought to see it watered down			1
' this is not going to sail through the @entity52 , ' he said			2
' there will be a vote on whether this goes forward			2
the only issue is whether we give the government enough uncertainty over the result that they look at the alternatives			0
in the 1980s @entity63 chancellor @entity62 put vat on hot food			1
but he exempted freshly baked products , such as pastries and pies , that were still warm from the bakery oven			0
@entity18 considered this a loophole that needed closing			1
all food – pasties , sausage rolls , toasted sandwiches and rotisserie chickens – that is sold hot in any shop will have to charge the 20 per cent sales tax			1
hot takeaway restaurants and fish and chip shops already charge vat			1
the @entity43 guide says food is hot if it is ‘ above ambient air temperature when provided to the customer ’			1
this appears straightforward , but could cause huge confusion when you consider variable factors such as the weather or even how freshly - cooked the product is			0
sales at bakery chains such as @entity95 and @entity96 have soared in recent years			0
but the new tax will mean many prices rising by 20 per cent and not surprisingly they are trying to force the @entity43 into a rethink			1
' we are looking for a coalition that can win a commons ’ vote			1
' the summit heard from industry figures that the vat could sound the ' death knell ' for many businesses			0
under the current rules all hot food carries vat but pasties and other savoury products such as sausage rolls are exempt because they are baked and are only warm because they have recently come out of the oven			2
the chancellor said in last month ’s budget that he wants to create a level playing field by imposing the tax on bakeries and supermarkets to bring them in line with fast - food outlets which already pay vat			1
pasty industry figures at the summit said the planned introduction of 20 % vat on their products would lead to a similar fall in sales that would hit jobs in a county already among the poorest in @entity37			2
@entity131 , chairman of the @entity133 trade body , said the industry wanted to avoid a cut in jobs and investment that would likely come if the vat was added and hailed the ' fantastic public support ' that the campaign had received			0
' we all realise we have to tighten our belts in this period of austerity and i think we all understand we have overspent here and there , ' he said			0
' but when you start taxing just everyday food i think that starts to get a little bit hard and quite frankly people are a bit fed up and that it why i think you have seen such a big reaction			0
' pastry but not a pasty : politicians , including prime minister @entity158 , seemed keen to be pictured eating pasties in the wake of the ' @entity162 ' fiasco all six @entity3 , @entity10 mr @entity9 , @entity163 and @entity164 , plus @entity63 @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , have questioned the plan to charge the standard rate of vat from october			1
mr @entity9 , the only mp to attend the summit at the offices of accountancy firm @entity172 , said he believed there would be an opportunity to vote on the plan before @entity8 rises for the summer			0
delegates at the summit , chaired by local tax expert @entity179 , outlined potential ways to approach the government over the tax , ranging from pushing for a complete repeal to trying to gain concessions such as paying vat at only 5 % or asking for pasties to be exempted			2
no decision was made during the session			0
just another lunch : labour leader @entity190 and shadow chancellor @entity191 popped to @entity95 following ' @entity162 ' @entity192 , chairman of the @entity194 food company , which manufactures pasties , said his firm is likely to have to cut jobs if the plan goes ahead			0
' i think he ( the chancellor ) needs to take a look at it because the net benefit of vat could be lost through general taxation if companies like us have to scale down and our profits reduce , ' he said			0
' it ( the pasty ) is a way of life and part of the retail scene in town centres , and retail is struggling enough already			2
' we have had real material cost increases over the last four years			0
for some companies , this could be the real death knell			0
