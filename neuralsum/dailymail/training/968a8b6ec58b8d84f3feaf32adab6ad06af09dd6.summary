a personal trainer was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer after doctors mistook a lump on his right knee for a pulled muscle			1
@entity7 has now been told he has just 18 months to live after the disease returned for a second time in two years			1
he was first diagnosed with myxoid liposarcoma - a rare soft tissue cancer - in november 2012			1
despite initially being told the disease was completely curable , tests just months later revealed it had spread throughout his body			1
now the 30 - year - old is trying to raise £ 150,000 to travel to the @entity16 to take part in a potentially life - saving clinical trial			1
@entity7 , pictured with his girlfriend @entity19 , was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of soft tissue cancer , metastatic myxoid liposarcoma in november 2012 when mr @entity7 , pictured with miss @entity24 left , and his nephew @entity25 , right , first went to see a gp , complaining of a lump behind his right knee , the doctor mistook the tumour for a pulled muscle with no cure available for him in the @entity32 , mr @entity7 believes travelling to @entity33 to receive a unique treatment could be his last hope			1
patients at a hospital there are taking part in a trial where cancer patients are given a vaccine			2
the theory is the body will recognise the cancer as a disease and will fight it itself			2
mr @entity7 , who is originally from @entity48 but now lives in @entity49 , visited his gp in the summer of 2012 after finding a lump behind his right knee			1
' it took a while for me to go to the doctors , as it did n't hurt , ' mr @entity7 said			1
' the doctor said i had pulled a muscle , but i was n't convinced			1
' i was in the process of moving down to @entity49 at the time , so it was another three months before my missus forced me to do something about it			2
' in the end the lump was almost the size of my fist			1
' after visiting another @entity26 in @entity49 , he was sent for an mri scan and a biopsy at @entity71			0
the tests revealed the lump was cancerous and he was diagnosed with metastatic myxoid liposarcoma			1
it is a very rare form of sarcoma - a cancer of the soft tissue - and affects the connective tissues			1
the disease usually presents as a painless slow - growing lump , and can often by misdiagnosed as a result			1
the tumours are usually confined to the extremities , particularly the thigh			0
' i was told it was completely curable , ' said mr @entity7			2
' it was a bit worrying as i was going into the unknown			0
over the course of the next three months the lump continued to grow , until it reached the size of a fist			1
he returned to see another @entity26 , this time in @entity49 after moving , and was referred for a biopsy and mri scan			2
the tests revealed the lump was cancerous and mr @entity7 began treatment immediately in march 2013 , surgeons a the @entity99 , removed the lump			1
mr @entity7 also faced rounds of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to try and treat the cancer ' but i was mainly concerned about how it would affect my leg , and my job as a personal trainer			1
' to be honest , i was worried if there would be scar tissue , and whether i would be crippled afterwards			0
' once he had received his diagnosis , mr @entity7 started a five - week course of radiotherapy			1
he then had surgery at the @entity99 to remove the tumour in march 2013			2
surgeons cut through the back of his leg and lifted up parts of his hamstring to remove the tumour			1
he said : ' the operation went really well , they removed everything			2
i was able to do a lot of the rehabilitation myself			0
' for the next nine months mr @entity7 worked on his recovery , and underwent regular check ups to monitor the cancer with ct scans and to drain fluid from his leg			1
but it was then that he noticed lumps on his left leg and upper back			1
mr @entity7 has been diagnosed with metastatic myxoid liposarcoma			1
it is a very rare form of sarcoma - a cancer of the soft tissue - and affects the connective tissues			2
it typically affects adults aged 40 to 60 years old			0
the disease usually presents as a painless slow - growing lump , and can often by misdiagnosed as a result			2
the tumours are usually confined to the extremities , particularly the thigh			0
the size of the tumour and where it is , affects a patient 's prognosis , with tumours smaller than 10 to 15cm having a better survival rate			0
in around half of cases , the disease spreads to other parts of the body , commonly to the lungs			0
' when i went back to my doctors they were n't very optimistic , and i could tell it was n't going to be good news , ' he said			2
' they looked very worried			0
' mr @entity7 , who lives with girlfriend @entity19 and her 12 - year - old son @entity169 , was sent for more tests which revealed his cancer was back			1
an mri scan showed the stage 4 cancer had spread to his hip , spine and pelvis , and doctors told him he had around 18 months to live			1
' it felt as thought two or three people were trying to prepare me to die , ' he said			0
' one said , " we can make you feel as good as we can for as long as possible "			0
' my gp asked me what i wanted to do with my time			0
i did n't want to sit and make a bucket list			0
' they did n't even give me any advice about diet - they told me i could eat whatever i wanted			0
even for a healthy person , that is n't good advice			0
' i did n't want to sit and dwell , i want to fight it , so i asked for a new team			0
' mr @entity7 , who loves football , surfing and running , was finding it difficult to walk due to the pain in his hip			2
with a new specialist team he started another , more intense round of radiotherapy , this time for two weeks			0
in the meantime he started doing his own research into clinical trials available both in @entity207 and in @entity16 , as well as changing to a special low - sugar diet to try and starve the cancer cells			1
he also started practising yoga and meditation to give him a positive and healthy mentality			0
' i had been told that radiotherapy and chemotherapy would n't cure me , ' said mr @entity7			1
for nine months , mr @entity7 worked on his recovery			2
but he then noticed more lumps that had appeared on his left leg and upper back			1
tests confirmed the cancer had returned			2
doctors told him the disease had spread to his hip , spine and pelvis and gave him just 18 months to live determined not to give up , mr @entity7 , pictured with ( from l to @entity227 ) his mother @entity229 , twin sister @entity228 and nan @entity230 , began to research clinical trials in the @entity16 ' but i wanted to talk to someone detached from the medical profession , like a research professor			1
' in the @entity32 there are clinical trials available , but i had to have chemotherapy , and that is not something i want to put my body through			1
' eventually he tracked down @entity242 , a professor at the division of medical oncology at the @entity245 in @entity246 , who explained to him the current trials being carried out in the @entity16			2
but because mr @entity7 is n't a @entity16 citizen , if he wants to qualify for the trials he will have to pay for the treatment himself , at a cost of up to £ 150,000			1
' it felt great to talk to him , ' he said			0
' he was the first person not to just pooh - pooh everything			0
' he has since moved over to @entity253 , and we were able to sit down and talk it through			0
' he told me about dr @entity256 who is running a trial where you are given a vaccine , as though you had mumps or measles , and your body will recognise the cancer as a disease and will fight it itself			2
' now friends and family are determined to get mr @entity7 over to @entity16 for the potentially life - saving trial , and they are on a fundraising mission to raise the money in the next few months			1
friend @entity271 has set up a website , and friends and even strangers have started to donate to the urgent cause			0
' i guess my friends just have n't had enough of me yet , ' added mr @entity7			2
' they may regret it when i 'm well again			0
' friends who i have n't spoken to for years have got in touch and donated			0
there is not really a way i can thank them			0
' it can often be more difficult for the people closest to me , than for me			0
' but i am writing it all down in a blog at the moment , and maybe that could be one way to give back when i publish it			0
' @entity289 and friends are now trying to raise more than £ 150,000 to fund mr @entity7 's trip to the @entity16 , to @entity33 where he hopes to enrol on a clinical trial that is testing a new vaccine - like drug for cancer mr @entity7 , who is a personal trainer , said : ' this is an opportunity without which , i do n't really have any kind of hope ' mr @entity7 hopes to travel out to the @entity16 at the end of the month for some holistic treatments , and to talk to dr @entity301 and hopefully put plans in place to start treatment			1
he said : ' they ca n't tell me whether the trial will work			0
' but this is an opportunity without which , i do n't really have any kind of hope			0
' @entity310 , who has known @entity7 for 13 years , urged people to donate to his treatment			2
she said : ' @entity313 is just a great all round guy really			0
he can brighten up any situation with his unique sense of humour			0
' he 's always been willing to help out friends when they needed it			0
' despite going through treatments , @entity313 goes out of his way to help any of his friends , no matter what			0
' during his time as a personal trainer he has helped so many people change their lives , so please help us return the favour			1
