@entity0 led @entity1 to a @entity3 play - off final at @entity4 and then challenged them to make history by achieving their sixth promotion in 10 seasons			1
the @entity9 , reformed for the second time in 1997 , beat @entity10 1 - 0 on aggregate - following friday night 's 0 - 0 draw at @entity12 - and now have the chance to enter uncharted waters by reaching the third tier of @entity17 football			1
that is where the likes of @entity20 , who @entity0 played for over 350 times , and @entity22 will be competing next season but the ambitious outfit from the north - west coast have the financial backing befitting a club at such a level			1
one more step : @entity0 has challenged his @entity32 side to earn their sixth promotion in 10 seasons special day : @entity34 is congratulated by fans after helping @entity1 to the @entity3 play - off final after missing out on a top - three spot , @entity1 now have the chance to join promoted sides @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 in @entity43 , a berth @entity0 insists they deserve			1
' i 'm really happy - to get to @entity4 is the next step that we wanted to take , it 's not the goal , it 's not the target , but it 's the next step , ' the former @entity46 international said			2
' @entity10 made it hard for us for at nil - nil			1
it was end - to - end and a proper play - off game and we 're pleased we got there			1
' the hosts had to weather considerable storms to record their second straight clean sheet , meaning @entity64 's goal four days ago in @entity65 settled the semi-final over the two legs			0
@entity1 's man of the match was central defender @entity70 , who is in his testimonial year and has been with the team for each of their previous five promotions			2
' when it came down to the crunch the defenders and the goalkeeper were fantastic over the two legs , especially tonight , ' added @entity0			2
' it was one for men and that 's what we saw out there			0
' celebrations : midfielder @entity64 is mobbed by fans following @entity1 's 0 - 0 draw at home to @entity10 @entity0 's side have been close to glory this season and not only narrowly missed out on automatic promotion , but also on a previous @entity4 final when they were defeated by @entity40 in the @entity95 area final			1
' we deserve to put ourselves in the final because we were the fourth team in the league and highest placed in the play - offs , ' argued @entity0			1
' it does n't give you anything but for us , finishing just behind the top three , we deserved it			0
we earned it over 180 minutes against @entity10 and now we 've got a very tough game against whoever gets through to the final			1
' @entity106 and @entity107 are the other two sides in the semi-finals , with the former leading 1 - 0 from the first leg at home			0
the @entity10 failed to find the net in the tie 's 180 minutes but their manager @entity114 admitted his troops gave everything in an open contest			2
on the attack : @entity1 's @entity119 has a shot at goal during the goalless draw with @entity10 on friday ' i thought it was a tremendous effort from start to finish , ' he said			1
' the energy , commitment - they never stopped			0
that 's the type of group we 've had and as the manager of the football club i 'm very proud of them			0
' not just tonight , they 've done that all season			0
to come away to a very good side and put on a show like that you 've got to be proud			0
' although @entity10 failed to carve out any clear - cut chances they enjoyed large spells of possession and territorial advantage , yet came up short against a resolute home defence led by @entity70			2
@entity114 continued : ' there were many half chances tonight when the ball was in and around the box but it 's just got to fall to you			0
sometimes you 've got to make that ; that 's about better finishing and being sharper			0
but @entity1 are a good side and i wish them well in the final			2
' it 's disappointing at the moment but you 've got to get over that , dust yourself down and get ready for the new season once we 've had a holiday			0
