a new volcanic island off the coast of @entity3 has tripled in size since it formed just over a month ago , experts have said			1
the land mass , which has now been named @entity6 , was first spotted on november 20 in the @entity8 chain around 600 miles south of @entity9			1
initially , scientists were unsure how long it would last because volcanic islets of that type tend to be reclaimed by the sea after a short time			1
however , the island has actually expanded to 56,000 square metres ( 13.8 acres ) - around three times its size - as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below			0
a @entity40 satellite image taken on december 8 shows @entity6 next to its closest island , the uninhabited @entity25 which lies around 500m away			0
the discoloration of the water caused by the volcanic minerals and white puffs of steam and gases can also be seen			0
the mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption on november 20 in a region dubbed @entity53			2
growing presence : this picture was taken on december 6 , just over two weeks after the island formed in this @entity40 satellite image from december 8 , @entity6 can be clearly seen next to the larger @entity25 smoke billows from a new islet off the coast of @entity25 , a small , uninhabited island in the @entity8 chain off the coats of @entity9			1
at that point , it was around 600ft in diameter in september a similar new island appeared off the coast of @entity68			1
it was forced to the surface following an earthquake and was made up a mound of mud and rock 70ft high and 295ft wide / the phenomenon on the coastline near the port of @entity79 caused astonishment when it emerged from the @entity81 but , like the new islet in @entity3 , experts said it was unlikely to last long			1
although the area regularly experiences earthquakes and eruptions , they are rarely as powerful as the latest one			0
in fact , the forming of the new island is the first time the phenomenon has happened in almost 30 years			0
video footage showed smoke billowing from part of the ocean around the @entity8 island chain and the @entity3 coastguard later confirmed it was coming from the new islet			2
this chain is made up of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands			0
the islet is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean floor			1
volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could have been as high as @entity106			0
the mass of rock , pictured , was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region of the @entity33 dubbed @entity53 the coastguard warned sailors to use caution in the area and avoid travelling near it until the heat from the eruption cools off			2
he added that the islet may not last long due to erosion , but if enough volcanic lava surfaces and solidifies it could create a new marker on the map			1
similar eruptions in the early 1970s and 80s created tiny islets in @entity3 's territory that have since disappeared			0
the new islet rose into the ocean near the @entity131 , also known as the @entity8 chain			2
this chain is made up of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands around 620 miles south of the @entity3 capital , pictured the islet , pictured , is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean floor			1
volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could be as high as 1,000 ° c. the coastguard has warned sailors to use caution in the area and avoid travelling near it until the heat from the eruption cools off ‘ if this becomes a solid island , our country 's territorial waters will expand , ’ chief cabinet secretary @entity150 said			0
in september a similar new island appeared off the coast of @entity68			2
it was forced to the surface following an earthquake and was made up a mound of mud and rock 70ft high and 295ft wide			2
the phenomenon on the coastline near the port of @entity79 caused astonishment when it emerged from the @entity81 but , like the new islet in @entity3 , experts said it was unlikely to last long			0
in november this year , a powerful volcanic eruption in the @entity33 created a new island off the coast of @entity3 , pictured			0
the mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region dubbed @entity53 - a hub of seismic activity situated 620 miles south of @entity9 experts said the islet , pictured , may not last long due to erosion , but if enough volcanic lava surfaces and solidifies it could create a new islet a new entry on the map			1

the islet was 600ft in diameter when it appeared off south coast of @entity9
now measures nearly *60,000* square feet and rises 80ft above sea level
scientists *doubted* it would survive but now think it could last *forever*
@entity198 is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean bed
