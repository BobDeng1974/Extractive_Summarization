by @entity0 former @entity1 might be blessed with supermodel looks but over half of @entity5 women do n't believe her claim that she takes 15 minutes to get ready and leave the house in the morning			1
the busy mum of one ( son @entity9 is three years old ) , who also runs her own company , wrote recently in her blog : ' i usually have very little time in the mornings , especially with a toddler , so with these simple skin and beauty steps i can get out the door in 15 minutes			2
' @entity21 's daily regime starts with a glass of warm water with the juice of half an organic lemon followed by dry body brushing , which she describes as an ' integral '			1
the supermodel does seem to have something in common with the average woman , saying that she multi-tasks in the shower by cleansing her face and body with @entity52 and @entity53 , part of her own line of organic beauty products			0
a third of the women who responded to the survey said that they would finish applying their make - up on their commute to work if they were in a rush			0
out of 1,000 women who took part in the research most said that @entity21 's routine would take them at least 40 minutes from start to finish and nearly half do n't believe that supermodels need less time to get ready			1
