by @entity1 reporter published : 08:05 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 10:37 est , 13 september 2012 the moment of truth : @entity3 could not collect his gcse results until he paid his lunch bill a teenager who almost died during a @entity8 exam when he suffered a heart attack at his desk was banned from collecting his results - because he had an outstanding £ 5.60 lunch bill			1
teachers told schoolboy @entity3 he could not have his exam grades until he paid for the pizza and baguette he had eaten months earlier			1
the 16 - year - old had been unable to settle the canteen bill after he was rushed into hospital with multiple organ failure , having recently been diagnosed with cardiolipin syndrome			1
he was discharged from hospital in time to sit his gcses but almost died in may when he suffered a cardiac arrest during a maths exam			1
but he was shocked when he went to school to collect his results last month and was told they were being withheld because of the outstanding lunch debt			1
@entity3 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , said : ' it was all a bit ludicrous really			1
' i ’ve had a tough time and because i was n’t at school i was n’t able to pay the bill			2
' one of my teachers slyly told me i had got a c when i got there on the day so it really got me excited to see whether i had done the same in any other subjects			0
' but when my head of year told me i could n’t have them until i had settled a mere £ 5.60 - i was shocked			1
' i had n’t taken any money with me because i had n’t really been thinking about the outstanding bill for a pizza , baguette and a drink - i was more concerned about my health			1
' i suffer from high blood pressure and i do n’t think that did me any good			0
' i had to come away from the school not knowing if i had got into college or not , it was devastating and i was really angry			0
' @entity3 was in his final year at @entity55 in @entity29 , when he was struck down with cardiolipin syndrome , lupus disease and kidney failure			1
school days : @entity3 was in his final year at @entity55 in @entity29 , @entity30 exams : @entity3 returned to @entity55 last month expecting to collect his gcse results he was forced to spend three months in hospital undergoing dialysis and taking a daily cocktail of powerful steroids to control his condition			1

the school agreed to award @entity3 , who wants to study psychology and sociology at @entity74 , his gcses based on his mock exam results and predicted grades			1
but when he went to school on august 31 to collect his results he was turned away at the door until he paid the canteen bill			0
he walked home and returned with his fuming mother @entity83 , 44 , who stormed back to the school to demand an explanation			0
she said : ' settling a £ 5 bill was the last thing on his mind - he has been seriously ill in hospital			0
' he struggled to get to the school on that day but he was determined to collect his results with his friends			2
' but he was humiliated in front of all his mates and this is the last thing he needed			0
family : @entity3 supported by his brothers @entity95 , 21 ( left ) , and @entity97 , 11 ( right ) ' i was also worried about his blood pressure because that can be high because of his illness			2
' i thought they should at least show the lad a bit of compassion after what he has been through			0
' i think it is disgusting how they treated him - it was n’t even some random receptionist - it was his head of year who knew fully well what he had been through			2
' i was told it was school policy			0
' i explained how ill @entity3 had been and felt she showed no compassion for my child			2
' the whole situation was ludicrous - it was totally ridiculous			0
' he really wants to go to college now , he really is a determined little thing and he ’s had a rough ride			0
' a teacher finally handed over the results after @entity83 agreed she would settle the canteen bill			0
