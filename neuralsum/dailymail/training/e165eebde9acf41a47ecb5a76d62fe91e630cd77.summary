by @entity0 and @entity1 a leading architect has compared @entity4 ’s plans for a @entity6 airport to the grandiose projects @entity8 might have dreamed up			1
sir @entity9 , who designed the @entity11 spy building , said the @entity14 mayor ’s plan for a £ 65billion airport was ‘ mad ’			1
sir @entity9 said : ‘ when people say that you have got to have vision , well @entity8 had vision			1
' vision can be a madness where you get so obsessed you throw everything you have got on the roulette table and hope you got it right			0
’ @entity8 famously had his architect @entity26 draw up plans on an epic scale for a radically re-designed @entity29 – to be renamed ‘ @entity30 ’			2
vision : @entity32 ( pictured ) on the @entity33 has today been backed by the @entity13 above his own @entity35 plan because of its proximity to @entity14 argument : announcing his three preferred options for aviation expansion @entity4 said today that building a new runway at @entity42 would be ' crackers ' all change : @entity4 's plans for a new airport would demand that @entity42 is bought and replaced with a 250,000 new @entity14 borough sir @entity9 , who has designed some of the world ’s largest airports and train stations , including @entity52 , said the four - runway proposal was on an unprecedented scale for the @entity55 and made the @entity57 high - speed rail project ‘ look like chicken feed ’			1
mr @entity4 yesterday underlined his commitment to an estuary airport by naming sir @entity61 ’s @entity33 plan as his first choice			1
the mayor also wants to shut @entity42 at a cost of £ 15billion to create a new @entity14 borough for 250,000 residents			2
but sir @entity9 , who is working on @entity69 ’s bid to build a second runway , said closing @entity42 and moving the capital city ’s main airport to the east would mean ‘ flipping @entity14 ’			1
sir @entity9 was approached by the mayor to work on his project but turned it down			1
announcing his three preferred options to expand aviation capacity in the @entity55 this morning , he ruled out a ' crackers ' third runway at @entity42 and demanded a new airport east of @entity14 or the expansion of @entity84 instead			1
mr @entity4 said : ' ambitious cities all over the world are already stealing a march on us and putting themselves in a position to eat @entity14 's breakfast , lunch and dinner by constructing mega airports that plug them directly into the global supply chains that we need to be part of			1
' those cities have moved heaven and earth to locate their airports away from their major centres of population , in areas where they have been able to build airports with four runways or more			0
' for @entity14 and the wider @entity55 to remain competitive we have to build an airport capable of emulating that scale of growth			0
anyone who believes there would be the space to do that at @entity42 , which already blights the lives of hundreds of thousands of @entity117 , is quite simply crackers			2
' he also admitted that @entity35 might be a ' bit far away ' from @entity14 and said that @entity32 was his preferred option			2
@entity4 has backed the four - runway ' @entity32 ' ( pictured ) , which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers a year on the @entity33 in @entity124 elaborate plan : the @entity33 's proposed international railway station , which would include a service to @entity128 in 26 minutes once shut down , any @entity42 buyout would be bank - rolled by the government and the mayor 's aviation adviser @entity133 has said its rail , road and tube links would make it an ideal place for a new development on the western edge of the capital			1
' @entity142 ' : the inner estuary site on @entity124 's @entity33 is close enough to @entity14 to provide smooth and fast access by public transport , yet ideally located so as to allow take - off and landing over water and so impact on as small a population as possible			2
it sits in an area with a strong industrial history , and is across the water from the new @entity154			0
a new hub airport there would lay the foundation for a future logistics heartland of the @entity55			0
' @entity35 ' : an airport on an artificial island off the @entity124 coast would remove all problems of noise pollution and give the airport the freedom to operate in whatever way it needed in order to maximise the @entity55 ’s connectivity and economic benefits			1
stansted expansion : developing a major four - runway airport at @entity84 would have the attraction of building on existing infrastructure and being sited in a relatively sparsely populated region , @entity84 has none of the environmental or wildlife issues that would need to be overcome in the estuary			0
' for an airport , that is not very good connectivity			0
but most outer @entity14 boroughs would bite your hand off for transport links like that , ' he said			0
but @entity42 bosses say shutting down their airport would cost almost 80,000 jobs , the biggest cull since @entity55 's coal mine closures during the 1980s			1
' it seems extraordinary that any mayor of @entity14 would propose forcibly buying and then closing @entity42			0
the mayor 's proposals would leave 114,000 people facing redundancy , cost taxpayers more and take longer to deliver than building on the strength we already have at @entity42 , ' a spokesman said			2
this morning mr @entity4 announced that ' @entity32 ' , ' @entity35 ' or the expansion of @entity84 would be the three best ways to solve @entity55 's lack of aviation capacity			1
mr @entity4 's plans will be submitted later this week to the government - appointed @entity208 headed by sir @entity210 , who will help the government make the final decision			1
mr @entity4 said that a new hub airport would be able to support more than 375,000 new jobs by 2050 and add £ 742billion to the value of goods and services produced in the @entity55			1
he said it could be built by 2029 , with a hybrid bill being passed by parliament to secure approval for the airport , the surface access and the acquisition of @entity42			0
two ideas : this graphic shows how planners have designed two new airports on the @entity6 , one on the edge of @entity33 nicknamed ' @entity32 ' and the ' @entity35 ' proposal in the middle of the estuary talking about the future of the @entity42 area should a new airport be sited elsewhere , mr @entity4 said that part of west @entity14 , with good transport links , had the space and infrastructure to generate up to 100,000 new homes that @entity14 badly needed			1
there was the potential to attract tens of thousands of jobs in a number of different sectors and while some workers at @entity42 would relocate to the new airport , many others would find work in a newly - developed @entity42 area			0
mr @entity4 's chief adviser on aviation , @entity133 , said : ' @entity42 can never solve our problems and our studies show that we 're better off with a new site			1
' the immense noise , pollution and congestion that would result from expanding an airport located in the heart of our suburbs would potentially devastate the greatest city in the world			0
' the mayor 's original preferred plan had been nicknamed @entity35 in his honour as he has championed the idea to build it on an artificial island made of landfill			1
it would be two miles north of the @entity272 and ferries would link the site to @entity124 and @entity275 while a railway bridge could connect it to the mainland			0
if the @entity33 plan happens the scheme is expected to be designed by eminent architect @entity61 and an airport would have a minimum of four runways , with space to build two more			2
vision : this is what @entity84 could look like if it was turned into a four - runway superhub ( design above and plan below ) marches : celebrities including chef @entity291 have joined protest to prevent @entity84 growing in any way the entire project would cost about £ 65 billion , including a new train line taking passengers to @entity128 in 26 minutes			0
planes would descend over the @entity298 rather than densely populated parts of @entity14 , as many do when coming in to @entity42			0
mr @entity4 now says that the @entity33 plan has the ' greatest single potential for regeneration '			1
the blueprint involves an opening scheduled for 2029 , requiring infrastructure improvements such as extending @entity307 and widening the @entity309 an extra lane in each direction for 36 miles			0
ongoing fight : a longstanding campaign has been fought to prevent a third @entity42 runway , but if airports move to the east of the @entity14 , tens of thousands will lose their jobs on top of those three suggestions , @entity42 will be revealing its own plans to expand with a third and maybe even fourth runway			2
the mayor also argues that @entity84 could be transformed into a four - runway international super-airport as part of a ' compromise ' package			2
a super high speed rail link - cutting the journey time to @entity14 to 25 minutes - would also be built to support its growth			0
but it will still be highly controversial as proposals for a second runway there have already led to years of protests from people living under its flighpath			0
@entity84 has been targeted by many protests including one where more than 50 people burst onto its runway and shut it down for more than five hours			0
celebrities including @entity291 have also joined other protests .			0

mayor unveils his preferred options to expand @entity55 's aviation capacity
sir @entity9 labels ideas ' mad ' and compared it to @entity8 's grand plans
mr @entity4 has backed away from his plan for ' @entity35 ' in @entity6
now @entity4 favours ' @entity32 ' airport on @entity33 in @entity124
he says anyone who believes @entity42 should be expanded is ' crackers '
@entity84 could also be expanded from two to four runways in ' compromise '
