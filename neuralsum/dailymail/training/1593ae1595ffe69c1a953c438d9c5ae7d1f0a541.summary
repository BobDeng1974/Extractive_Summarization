soaring temperatures could make tomorrow the hottest day of june so far , particularly in the @entity7 and @entity8 , where the mercury could reach highs of @entity11 ( 84f )			1
but the respite will be all too brief , with scattered showers likely to return shortly afterwards , followed by thundery downpours towards the end of the week			0

' @entity169 and northern @entity82 will see early rain clear to leave a mixture of sunny spells and scattered showers during the afternoon			0
' remaining areas of the @entity50 will see a lot of dry weather but developing sunshine is likely to trigger a few potentially sharp and thundery showers			1

' on thursday , northern areas will see rain during the day , heavy and prolonged			2
there will be showers elsewhere , some of these heavy and thundery			2

great @entity50 hope : @entity59 in practice ahead of his match with @entity205 tonight as the @entity207 's bid to win @entity18 begins warming up : the sun shone for @entity59 's opening match at the @entity60 that was due to start at 5pm today ' there will be some bright and sunny spells on friday with scattered showers			1
some of the showers will be heavy particularly across @entity80			2
' meanwhile , the brief spells of hot weather have seen a new range of pet care products launched in the @entity50 - suncream for dogs			1
research has shown that dogs are just as likely to get skin cancer as humans , so a company has developed canine - friendly sunblocks to combat the uv rays			1
the range includes a ' sunstick ' that can be rubbed on to vulnerable areas like the muzzle , nose and ears , which are burnt most easily			0
there is also a ' sunmist ' which can be sprayed anywhere and is most effective on ' light coloured or short haired dogs '			2
@entity18 : the sun poked through the clouds for day two of the lawn tennis tournament on @entity64 @entity244 ‘ sunwipes ’ are available for extra protection , and can be used on any part of a canine ’s body			2
each of the three products compares itself with factor 15 suncreams for humans and promises to ‘ help prevent sunburn ’			0
two of the @entity254 products claim they provide ‘ the fastest , most convenient way to protect your dog from sun ’s harmful ultraviolet rays whenever they ’re outdoors			2
’ pet accessory distributor @entity261 brought the range to the @entity50 from the @entity264 , after spotting a gap in the market - although there may not be much call for them for the foreseeable future			1
@entity59 mania : @entity59 fans flocked to see their hero on the @entity64 today and made the most of a rare spell of warm sunshine in south west @entity8 committed : @entity18 fans put @entity82 's defeat in @entity279 behind them and focused on the tennis - some even camped out to get hold of tickets to see @entity59 warm wait : tennis fans basked in the sunshine as they queued for @entity18 tickets before the second day of play began today bright start : the crowds at @entity18 enjoyed the tennis in shades and sunhats this morning - but it could be a different story by the end of the week @entity294 , marketing director of @entity261 , said : ' dogs , like us , can get skin cancer and if you look online there is a lot of research into this			1
' a third of all tumours in dogs are sun related so we thought , there needs to be something to protect against it			1
' @entity308 ca n’t be used on dogs as there is the @entity311 chemical in them which is toxic to dogs			2
there was n’t a product for dog skin protection on the market in the @entity50 , so we have brought this range over and it will go into pet shops in two weeks ' time			1
' it ’s important to use sun protection on dogs because the risk of them damaging their health due to the sun exposure is quite high , it ’s the same as humans			1
' people may argue that fur protects a dog from sun damage but you have to also think that humans have a full head of hair and still get skin cancer			0
it affects short - haired breeds more than long - haired breeds but both varieties are at risk			0
' you apply the products just as you would to a person as the lotions impregnate the fur and seep down to the skin			0
' the sunwipes cost £ 3.99 , the sunmist £ 6.99 , and the sunstick £ 5.99			0
meanwhile , parts of the country were hit by another problem this morning - dense fog			0

a spokesman for the race organisers said : ' we hope it will have lifted in time for racing to get under way this afternoon			0
' this month is already the third wettest june on record , @entity76 figures show , with 122.3mm of rain putting it just behind the second wettest june , in 1912 , which saw 124.5 mm of rain and a little way off the wettest june , in 2007 , which saw 136.2 mm. the showers have not been evenly spread out , with some areas having already seen record rainfall , while the far north and west of the @entity50 have remained surprisingly dry			1
hot dog : @entity392 , two , gives @entity82 bulldog @entity394 , also two , a careful scrub on the nose with a canine - friendly sunwipe			1
