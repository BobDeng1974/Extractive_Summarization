and in a sign of just how spoilt cute @entity19 terrier puppies @entity15 and @entity16 are - they are being flown back to the @entity20 for @entity21 by security guard , @entity14 can reveal			1

from there , they will either drive or travel on the @entity35 across the @entity36 to @entity10 's $ 14.4million @entity38 home , where they will stay for the holidays			1
indeed , the dogs - brother and sister - will set up home at the exclusive @entity38 address and stay there until @entity10 and his pregnant girlfriend @entity47 arrive in the @entity48			1
the couple will travel to @entity38 - along with their newborn son , due on february 28 - as @entity10 - whose fortune is now estimated at $ 370million - will be filming @entity20 's @entity53			1
a business class flight on @entity31 will cost around $ 10,000			1
and a source said ; ' @entity56 and @entity16 are very well looked after , to say the least			2
' but they have to travel in business class as @entity10 and @entity47 really do n't want to put them in the hold			1
' because dogs are n't allowed to travel in the cabin on a @entity20 carrier , @entity56 and @entity16 will land in @entity32 before being taken to @entity38			1
the source added : ' @entity56 and @entity16 have been to the vet and had their shots			2
when they 're in the @entity20 , they 'll get their @entity20 passports which will make it easier for them to travel			2

‘ i think dogs are good training for babies			0
they are still puppies and they are falling in the swimming pool and getting lost in the house			0
‘ this is a bit of a road test for the real thing			1
@entity101 is the girl and @entity16 is the boy and they are very naughty but great fun			2
i would say to anyone thinking about getting a dog – just do it			0
they bring so much happiness into your life			0
’ the yorkies have free run of the house and spend most nights curled up at the foot of their master ’s king - sized bed			0
@entity10 , who once admitted he was ‘ fanatical ’ about everything in his house being ‘ just so ’ , has clearly relaxed his rules for the new additions to his family			2
where he goes , we go : @entity10 cuddles his new @entity19 terrier puppies during a tv interview life is tweet : @entity10 has been posting uncharacteristically soppy messages about the dogs , like the on above which contained a picture of @entity101 meanwhile , as the @entity1 revealed , @entity47 , seven - months pregnant with @entity10 's baby , will be spending @entity21 with her son @entity133 , seven			1

@entity10 ’s romance with @entity47 is said to have developed during past @entity26 jaunts			1
@entity154 factor : @entity10 seems to be enamoured with @entity56 , who is the female one of the puppies their flirtations became obvious to friends during @entity10 ’s @entity21 break to @entity138 in 2011 , when @entity47 and her husband were invited			1
their divorce was made final earlier this month			0
they are now widely expected by friends to marry			0
their baby boy will be born in @entity149 , where @entity47 's mother @entity165 can travel in from her home in @entity167			1
and so far , @entity10 and @entity47 have been practicing at parenthood with their dogs			1
in one shot , @entity16 is seen drinking water from a fine china cup and saucer placed on a designer leather side table while @entity56 – who is virtually identical to her brother except for an ear which flops over – perches on a silk cushion on the custom - made sofa			2
another picture shows the pair relaxing on top of @entity10 ’s magnificent grand piano			2
a source said : ‘ @entity10 is devoted to the dogs			2
he adores them and they have the run of the place			0
' whenever they go missing they ’ve usually raced upstairs to find @entity10			0
normally there is n’t a pillow out of place but he ’s relaxed the rules for the puppies			0
they are very much his babies but he ’s definitely the master			0
he went away recently and when he came back he had to have words with @entity16 because he was strutting a little			2
‘ there was a bit of a drama when one of them almost fell into the swimming pool the other day			0
obviously the whole house will be properly child – proofed before the baby arrives			0
but the dogs have been a wonderful addition to the household			0
@entity10 has a dog trainer but it ’s pretty obvious they are the ones training him now			0
’ it is thought @entity10 named the pooches after his favourite 1960s cartoon about a musical squid called @entity218			0
but during an earlier season of the @entity220 , he referred to his fellow judges @entity221 and @entity223 by the moniker , dismissing them with the words : ‘ i think the audience at home are going to disagree with @entity56 and @entity16 here			0
’ dog house : the cute pooches seem to be enjoying life in the music mogul 's £ 22m @entity76 mansion , above there has been online speculation that a private chef cooks for the pups , but it is , in fact , @entity10 who is in charge at meal times			1
they are being raised on organic canned dog - food , which their master feeds them twice a day			0
he and @entity47 walk them together every evening			0
the puppies are house - trained and have had piles of dog toys lavished upon them , according to insiders			0
@entity10 says he will set up a @entity254 account for the yorkies soon , and has already used his own account to post pictures of the dogs			2
one was labelled , ‘ happiness is 2 puppies asleep ’ , another shows a dozing @entity15 with her eyes rolling back with the caption ‘ @entity101 has gone mad ’ and in another she is lounging on his bed with her tongue poking out , with the message : ‘ @entity56 wants an ice cream			0
’ lap of luxury : @entity56 and @entity16 relax on the pristine sofa at @entity10 's @entity76 home the pups have already had a taste of the spotlight , appearing on tv in @entity276 as their owner filmed segments promoting the latest series of the @entity220			1
