the @entity1 's top prosecutor today told critics deriding her decision not to prosecute @entity4 over alleged child sex offences to challenge her in court			1
@entity7 , the @entity8 , said she was ' not afraid ' of a legal challenge because she is convinced the @entity11 peer is not fit to plead because of his dementia			1
and in her first interview since she announced @entity4 would not face trial she refused to quit because ' making the right decision is not a resigning issue '			1
fighting back : @entity7 , the director of public prosecutions , said she was ' not afraid ' of a legal challenge over her decision not to charge @entity4 and said she would not quit victims and leading politicians have accused her of ' damaging public confidence ' in the justice system with her ruling – even though there was a enough evidence to go ahead with a prosecution			1
mrs @entity7 admitted herself that three investigations into claims made by 25 alleged victims over 25 years were botched - but decided it was now too late to charge him			1
she told the @entity32 today : ' if somebody wants to challenge my decision i 'm not afraid			2
the proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review			0
' i 'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up			1
i thought long and hard before making it and i 'm confident i got it right			1
my job is not to be populist			0
' the medical evidence was very clear			0
he would n't be fit to stand trial , he would n't understand the questions , he would n't understand the process , he would n't be able to understand instructions			0
' it 's not to make decisions on the basis of what people want			0
it 's about making the right decisions			2
sometimes that means it wo n't be popular but if i 'm fulfilling my duties as @entity8 that 's the right thing to do			1
' police began investigating @entity4 , pictured , after allegations of historic child - sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trial last night it emerged mrs @entity7 overruled the advice of two of the country 's most senior barristers to allow @entity4 to avoid a trial			1
@entity73 and child abuse expert @entity72 , leading counsel to the investigation , offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute			0
in particular , mrs @entity78 pointed to overwhelming evidence and corroborating accounts by victims during the two - year police inquiry			0
but mrs @entity7 decided it was not in the public interest to put @entity4 in the dock due to his alzheimer 's disease			1
campaigners , mps and victims believe a ' trial of the facts ' could have satisfied the need to get to the bottom of the appalling claims against the peer , whatever his mental state			0
and @entity99 revealed last week that 19 dementia sufferers have been prosecuted for child sex offences and ten were in the past year			0
the @entity103 revealed today that @entity4 signed over the deeds of his £ 2million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him , it can be revealed			2
the move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the @entity11 peer for compensation			1
the flat , in an exclusive gated community near @entity121 , @entity122 , was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in march last year - the same month police raided @entity4 's @entity128 office and three months after they had swooped on his home			2
in the four years after he was diagnosed with @entity132 's in 2009 , the former @entity11 mp , 86 , has claimed more than £ 100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances			2
@entity4 signed over the deeds of his £ 2 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raid even earlier this month , on april 9 , he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the @entity144			2
a week later , the @entity145 announced @entity4 would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from @entity132 's that he could not even understand any charges against him , let alone answer them			1
this was despite the fact the @entity145 ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988			2
victims have accused bungling authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice			0
child protection campaigners , mps , police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts			0
last night , two senior government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said concerns over the decision were justified			0
health secretary @entity173 said there was something ' very strange ' about the ruling and health minister @entity177 said the authorities should examine precedents of dementia sufferers being brought to trial			0
he added that the matter should be brought before a court because mrs @entity7 and the @entity145 had made ' heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so '			1
last seen : @entity189 filmed @entity190 outside his house in @entity122 on july 8 2014 , when he was last seen in public signed : dementia sufferer @entity4 signed a letter on april 9 , just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial			2
his signature has been redacted for privacy reasons mr @entity173 said @entity122 mayor @entity199 and home secretary @entity200 had been ' right ' to express concern at the decision , adding : ' i think we all think that there is something very , very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious			0
' @entity213 , a @entity215 peer and legal expert , said although there was strong evidence @entity4 had dementia , the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered			1
this week , leading politicians from seven parties demanded the decision be reversed			0
the group , led by @entity11 's @entity226 , wrote to @entity227 : ' as long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served , the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash			1
' a @entity145 spokesman confirmed mrs @entity78 advised mrs @entity7 to prosecute and that mrs @entity236 was consulted on an ' ancillary matter '			1
at least ten men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010			0
@entity242 , right and @entity72 , left , both recommended @entity4 should face trial			0

@entity7 wo n't quit because ' making the right decision is not a resigning issue '
head of @entity145 decided against pressing charges against @entity4
she was *persuaded* against taking a case by the @entity11 peer 's dementia
she said : ' i thought long and hard and i 'm confident i got it right '
