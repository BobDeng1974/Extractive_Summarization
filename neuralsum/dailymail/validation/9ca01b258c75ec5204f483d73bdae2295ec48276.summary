the world ’s largest boring machine was lifted out of an underground tunnel in @entity3 , where it has been stuck for more than a year after it broke down mid-job			2
the gigantic drill , known as @entity7 , stopped working in december 2013 after digging just 1,000ft of its two - mile journey to replace the aging @entity10 , which was damaged in 2001 by an earthquake			1
a crew from @entity15 construction company @entity13 used a huge red crane on monday to hoist the front end of the machine – which is fivestories tall and weighs 2,000 tonnes – out of the ground so it could be repaired			1
’ the operation was the fourth and final lift in the department ’s repair programme , with crews already removing three pieces of @entity7 ’s exterior from the pit , the department added			2
the machine 's breakdown and other construction issues have left the $ 80million project two years behind schedule and sparked concern about cost overruns and other unforeseen obstacles			1
the original highway overhaul was expected to cost $ 2 billion and be completed by 2015			2
the new timeline for replacing the busy @entity63 , damaged in a 2001 earthquake , is 2017			0
a white crane arrives on the scene in @entity3 to help lift part of @entity7 , which had been buried 120 feet underground workers prepare a gravel pad as @entity7 is pulled out of the ground			1
@entity13 , the company who set up the huge red crane to remove @entity7 , has completed similar lifts across the world including hoisting a @entity77 nuclear submarine from out of the @entity78 @entity79 , deputy highway 99 tunnel administrator for the @entity37 , praised the work of @entity13 , @entity81 ( @entity81 ) and tunnel - machine maker @entity83 in a report to the @entity85 , saying they had devised a good lifting plan and did an ' excellent job '			1
the mammoth task saw the digger gradually heaved to ground level at a rate of four to five inches a minute , with the help of seven miles of cable			1
he added that @entity7 now needs to be disassembled , inspected and repaired before construction companies commit to a time frame where the machine will start work again - with some contractors saying work could start again in august , @entity13 has performed other lifts around the world , including recovering a @entity77 nuclear submarine from the bottom of the @entity106 , in the @entity78			2
there had been concern that @entity7 , buried 120 feet might not be able to move itself to the pit opening because it had experienced various mechanical issues , including increased temperatures , before it stalled			0
the huge section of the digger was pulled up four to five inches a minute , using seven miles of cable , according to the @entity85 workmen scale the top of the red crane , to ensure the ropes are fixed properly as they lift the machinery out of the ground , while @entity124 project director @entity123 walks along the site to check the rescue operation is going to plan this photo was shared on @entity128 by @ @entity129 , with the caption : ' i 'm up and on the move ! being carried towards the white repair platform			1

along with mechanical issues , the project has been set back by other concerns			0
in february , four men at the site were injured when a rebar wall collapsed , causing them to fall 25 feet			0
two @entity3 firefighters walked about a half mile into the @entity167 99 tunnel and carried out one of the injured men while the others walked out			0

gigantic device , known as @entity7 , stopped working in december 2013 after digging just 1,000ft of a highway tunnel
workmen used a huge red crane to pull the front end of the broken - down tunnel in painstaking operation
@entity210 was lifted to ground level at a rate of four inches a minute and using seven miles of cable
breakdown has meant the $ 80 million project to replace the @entity10 has been delayed by two years
