not our fault ? @entity2 , chair of the @entity4 energy and climate change committee , says the temperature rise may be a natural process global warming may not be caused by mankind , the mp who scrutinises government policy on climate change said last night			1
@entity2 , who chairs the @entity4 energy and climate change committee , accepted that the earth ’s temperature is rising			1
but he said it was possible that the increase could be down to ‘ natural phases ’ in the earth ’s climate , and that human action is merely a ‘ possible cause ’			1
mr @entity2 , who was an environment minister under @entity23 , has previously spoken with great certainty about the impact of mankind on climate change and he is one of the @entity29 ’s strongest advocates of cutting carbon emissions			1
but on tuesday night he downplayed the impact of climate change , saying it posed ‘ no threat ’ to the survival of the planet and that the causes are ‘ not absolutely clear ’			1
asked whether it was better to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change than to prevent it , he said : ‘ the first thing to say is it does not represent any threat to the survival of the planet			1
‘ the planet has survived much bigger changes than any climate change that is happening now			1
‘ although i think the evidence that the climate is changing is now overwhelming , the causes are not absolutely clear			0
there could be natural causes , natural phases that are taking place			2
’ but he said governments should continue to cut carbon emissions , because there was still ‘ a risk ’ that global warming is caused by mankind			0
‘ there is at least a risk that the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a possible cause , ’ he said , adding that it was ‘ prudent ’ to be ‘ efficient in the use of energy ’			0
uncertainty : mr @entity2 says the causes of climate change are ' not clear ' mr @entity2 ’s scepticism puts him at odds with the scientific community			1
a recent survey of 12,000 academic papers on climate change found 97 per cent agree that human activities are causing the planet to warm			2
the mp ’s comments are particularly surprising in light of some of his previous comments on the issue			0
he said in 2009 : ‘ a significant number of core conservative voters , mostly among older people , are reluctant to accept the evidence			0
' i do n’t think they will be a significant influence in the next parliament and will gradually diminish in the population … in five years ’ time , no one will argue about a man - made contribution to climate change			2
’ a recent survey of 12,000 academic papers on climate change found 97 per cent agree that human activities are causing the planet to warm ' the dying gasps of the deniers will be put to bed			2
in five years ’ time , no one will argue about a man - made contribution to climate change			0
” ’ mr @entity2 , who was speaking to an audience of energy industry representatives and diplomats at the @entity112 , renewed his call for the government to build a third runway at @entity116			0
he said waiting for sir @entity118 ’ report on aviation capacity which is due after the next election was a ‘ ludicrous response to a clear national need ’			0
he said without better air links to east @entity125 , @entity123 risks becoming a ‘ sort of third world backwater quite quickly ’			0
asked about the comments on climate change yesterday , mr @entity2 told the @entity130 : ‘ it is possible there are natural causes as well , but my view has always been that - for twenty years - i have thought the scientific evidence has been very convincing			1
‘ the strong probability is that it is man - made causes contributing to greenhouse gas concentrations			0

@entity2 says humanity may not be behind climate change
it could be ' natural phases ' in the planet *'s* climate
@entity150 comments are at odds with most of the scientific community
