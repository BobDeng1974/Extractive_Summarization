by @entity0 - parkinson published : 06:18 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 11:13 est , 14 june 2012 looking across the rows of tents and the high - wire fence , you could be forgiven for thinking you are looking over a prisoner of war camp or a refugee settlement awaiting an influx of people from a conflict zone			2
but , complete with armed guards and untidy surroundings this is the scene that greeted hundreds of @entity15 football fans as they arrived in @entity16 , @entity17 , ahead of @entity15 's opening @entity19 group game on monday			1
the lines of white tents where fans who have been priced out of the town 's hotels are staying are in stark contrast to the @entity15 team 's luxury hotel in the centre of the @entity30 capital , @entity31			1
no , it 's not a refugee camp , it 's an @entity34 fan compound in @entity16 , @entity17 welcoming ? one of the signs greeting people as they arrive at the camp says : ' it was cool being with you guys ! come back soon ! ' it 's hardly a @entity43 piazza , but at least if you get into the vip section you get some shade from the sun in one of the open squares final preparations being made on the camp ahead of the start of @entity19 @entity30 fans who staged running battles with their @entity56 counterparts before and after the two teams met have warned @entity15 fans that they are next			1
they have told @entity34 supporters to expect worse than the violence seen on the streets of @entity62 on tuesday			1
police said that of the 184 arrested following the violence , 156 were @entity30			2
last night warnings posted on the internet suggested that the thugs now had @entity34 supporters in their sights , apparently in revenge for the way their countrymen living in the @entity72 are treated			1
one supporter revealed how a @entity30 football fan he met ont he plane told him how they would be targeted , according to the @entity77			1
he said : ' the guy said many of the ultra groups in @entity30 were planning to join together and attack @entity34 supporters in retaliation over how @entity30 are treated in the @entity72			1
' on tuesday it took more than 5,000 riot police armed with water cannon , tear gas and rubber bullets to quell the violence which started as more than 5,000 fans marched through the @entity30 capital to mark @entity91			1
it was seen as a provocative gesture by @entity30 who were ruled for decades from @entity95 under the old @entity97 rule			2
at £ 100 a night for a three - man berth , the price is a little steep , but still cheaper than the hotels in the centre of @entity16 , home of the stadium where @entity15 drew 1 - 1 with @entity103 on monday night			1
the campsite , with capacity for 1,000 people , is manned by a military guard who is less welcoming than the entrance sign that reads ' it was cool being with you guys ! come back soon ! '			0
despite the security presence , however , it hardly takes the @entity114 wherewithal of @entity116 squadron leader @entity115 to figure out who to get past the mesh barrier			0
one fan told the @entity120 : ' it 's not hard to get over that fence if you fancy a rob			2
' at the centre of the camp there is an unshaded square ( unless you go for a vip tent , then you 're provided at least with some rest from the sun )			0
it 's hardly a @entity43 piazza or a @entity136 carré , but it serves its purpose , namely it 's somewhere to sit together , shirtless , eating from fast food stalls , and drinking from beer tents dotted around the camp			2
it may be surprising , but there are actually three categories of accommodation from the basic to the ' luxury '			0
the basic one is a tent			0
for those wanting a more relaxing place to sleep a sleeping bag will be provided			0
but for those feeling flush and really wanting to get a good night 's sleep there is a tent in which you can stand up - at full height - with actual beds , which actually look more like gazebos you might put up in your back garden			2
it was a bit of a last - minute dash to build the final 150 of 250 tents on the site , but the job was done and it was home to 1,000 fans @entity171 shows off his @entity15 shirt in his ' luxury ' tent - luxury because he can stand up at full height oh , the luxury : fans @entity177 , @entity178 , and @entity179 relax in the @entity181 section @entity16 was actually founded by @entity183 businessman , @entity182 , who started up a steel plant and several coal mines			1
the city has a population of nearly 1million people and the main industry is still based on coal mining			0
for anyone wanting to do anything other than watch the football there is a boulevard that stretches 1.24miles with cafes , fountains and an interesting array of statues			0
there is also the @entity202 , now a five - star hotel , and @entity204			0
the main tourist street , however , is @entity206 which has hotels , parks , shops and restaurants , all housed in varying architecture			0
there is also a nod to the town 's founder - monument in front of the @entity217			0
included in the cost is the washing of linen , showers , toilets , and electricity for people to charge their mobile phones			0
another fan added before @entity15 's first game : ' it 's about what we expected			1
we heard the stories but there were n't any hotels at all in @entity16 , they just all went			2
that 's why we 're here			2
it could be better for sure			0
i have no idea how we 're going to get into town			0
' but those who have made it out this far would appear to be among the few - as the opening game against @entity103 was played out against a backdrop of a stadium that appeared at least a quarter empty			1
it is thought that the cost of travel and accommodation , and security fears kept many away			0
and the sight of this camp , and tuesday 's violence between @entity30 and @entity56 fans , the fears would seem to have been realised			1
the problem has been so marked that tickets for @entity15 's final group game against the hosts that originally went on sale for £ 40 are being sold for £ 14			1
just 4,000 of the allocation of 9,000 tickets for @entity15 fans have been taken up , which will result in the poorest attendance at any major championship for years			2
@entity56 fans will outnumber their @entity34 equivalents in the stadium for the match against @entity17			1
fans ' accommodation is quite different to @entity273 in @entity31 where @entity15 's players are staying @entity15 fans aseembled at the @entity275 ahead of monday 's opening game against @entity103 @entity15 's next game is tomorrow night in @entity278 against @entity279 , knowing that a win will go a long way to helping them secure a quarter - final place			1
those remaining in @entity16 , hoping that @entity15 will be playing there again in the quarter - finals , will have to content themselves with watching the game on tv			1
some who remained back in @entity15 , however , are not being allowed to watch the game after being told they had to work through it - despite being a 7.45 kick - off			1
in fact , bosses at one of the national team 's mains sponsors have provoked anger by banning staff from watching @entity15 's games			1
@entity302 factory workers were banned from watching monday 's draw with @entity103 and have been told that they can not see tomorrow evening 's game against @entity279 because it would ' breach health and safety regulations '			1
one worker at the company 's @entity309 plant told @entity311 : ' our company is the main sponsor for @entity15 yet when it comes to matches we are n't even allowed to watch			1
' fans dressed as knights enjoy all that @entity278 has to offer on the ball : @entity319 , @entity320 and @entity321 downing train in the rain ahead of tomorrow night 's crucial game against @entity279 @entity56 have the threat of a six - point deduction hanging over them during qualification for the next @entity329 in @entity103 in 2016			2
@entity330 handed out the punishment for the violence inside @entity334 ’s stadium during and after last friday ’s game against the @entity336			0
they also fined @entity56 £ 96,000			0
the hosts of the @entity340 finals in 2018 say they will appeal			0
@entity56 fans attacked stewards at @entity344 s stadium following their opening game on friday night the punishment does not relate to the violence between @entity56 and @entity30 fans in @entity62 on tuesday , but last night @entity330 said they would investigate that trouble			1
if found guilty over the fan violence that led to 24 injuries and more than 180 arrests , @entity56 could find the suspended six - point deduction imposed immediately			0
@entity56 @entity354 president @entity353 said : ‘ we want to submit an appeal against the punishment given			0
it is a shame that the team answers for the ill - considered actions and words of the fans			2
’ @entity354 ’s honorary president @entity363 added : ‘ six points is complete nonsense			0
i think this decision is aimed at discrediting @entity56 football in general			0

supporters who flew to @entity16 for @entity15 's opening game were put up in row upon row of basic white tents
@entity30 thugs have warned @entity34 fans they 're coming after them
back home , workers at national team sponsor @entity302 have been told they ca n't watch the match at work
