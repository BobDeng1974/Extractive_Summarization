by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 ‘ @entity5 , blown upon by mighty winds , breeder of mighty champions , ’ wrote the legendary golf writer @entity2 , who happened to be the grandson of @entity4			2
and he was right - the evolution of @entity10 winners at this venue is easy to trace : to lift the @entity12 here you must be a true links great			1
from @entity14 to @entity15 , @entity16 and the greatest of them all , @entity18 , @entity5 does indeed breed mighty champions			2
breeding ground : the @entity10 produces winners and to lift the @entity12 , you must be a true links great will he ? the bookies have priced up all the contenders and @entity25 have assessed the best to back @entity26 ready to roar once more so look no further than golf ’s big beasts in the field this week			1
that does n’t mean to say that having a major championship already in the bag is a must for the eventual winner this week - it sure helps , but this is a course where legends can be made			1
one man who has already claimed a spot among the game ’s pantheon is @entity18			2
the 14 - time major champion returns to the scene of his most emotional triumph , having won here just two months after the death of his father in 2006			1
@entity47 is bullish and claims only victory here will do – he won a @entity10 on a broken leg after all - but in his second tournament after major back surgery , surely this is a step to far for even a superman like @entity18			2
still , 22 - 1 is the most tempting price of all this week			1
resist if you dare … woods showed how to conquer @entity5 in 2006 – avoid the fairway bunkers at all costs and putt like a demon			0
in with a shout : 14 - time major champion @entity18 claims only victory in the @entity10 will do memories : woods won in @entity66 just two months after the death of his father in 2006 those taking the bold approach off the tee could be punished by @entity4 ’s mighty winds and find themselves caught in the traps or in the thick rough found at every @entity10 venue			1
the greens here are large for a links and fairly flat – a dead - eyed putter could clean up			2
that is why defending champion @entity82 ( 25 - 1 ) , who has not putted well since his crowning glory at @entity84 last summer , and world no 1 @entity86 ( 14 - 1 ) could fall just short			1
@entity86 looks focused and ready to add to his @entity88 victory last year , but the flat stick remains his one weakness			1
of the favourites , @entity91 looks the best bet			1
the hulking @entity94 also has a slight weakness in his putting but is the best ballstriker in the world right now			0
it surely is only a matter of time before he wins his first major			0
@entity91 ’s @entity10 record is mightily impressive after three top three finishes in his last five appearances , including a near miss at @entity84 last year			1
best bet : @entity91 is a good shout of the favourites for the @entity10 despite his putting weakness eyes on the ball : @entity91 's @entity10 record is impressive after top three finishes in his last five confident : @entity91 is the best ballstriker in the world right now ahead of the @entity10 start given that he destroyed the field in the last major contested in one of the game ’s all - time great performances , @entity115 is outstanding value at 25 - 1			1
the @entity121 has two majors under his belt and showed at @entity124 last month that his is the coolest putting stroke out there from any distance			0
@entity115 also won the previous big event he entered , the @entity128 in may , so is the game ’s in - form player along with @entity131			1
@entity132 ( 14 - 1 ) has claimed the @entity133 and @entity135 titles in successive weeks on either side of the pond			1
the @entity139 ’s win in @entity140 was his first on a links course since bursting on to the scene with a fourth at @entity143 as a teenager in 1998 , too			0
swing : @entity115 is outstanding value given he destroyed the field in a tremendous performance peviously contender : @entity139 hitter @entity131 's @entity133 and @entity135 titles were impressive stuck ? @entity132 is an in - form player and claimed titles in successive weeks on either side of the pond @entity152 looking to complete @entity10 hat - trick three to win @entity86 ( @entity155 ) — 14/1blew good chances to win in 2012 and 2013 but surely destined to hold the @entity12 one day			1
those watching him in practice believe this could be his time			0
@entity91 ( @entity160 ) — @entity161 was this time last year that the personable @entity94 went on his all - conquering run			1
fearless under pressure and likes the course			0
@entity166 ( @entity167 ) — 28/1first - round leader the last time @entity168 was at @entity5 and has all the tools to be leading after 72 holes			2
three for @entity171 ( finish in @entity172 ) @entity173 ( @entity174 ) — 12/1may be the most underrated player on the @entity175			0
@entity176 at @entity5 in 2000			0
@entity177 ( @entity178 ) — 20/1the eyes of good putters tend to light up when they see the smooth greens at @entity183			0
@entity177 can putt with the best of them			0
@entity186 ( @entity187 ) — 10/1given how many top 10s the 20 - year - old compiles , he has to represent decent value			2
the @entity190 should prosper on these putting surfaces			0
but surely three wins on the bounce is too much for anyone other than @entity18 in his prime , so the @entity197 man may have peaked just a little too soon			0
@entity115 ’s form , however , is too good to ignore			1
it was also difficult to look past @entity186 ’s assertion that he could one day break @entity202 ’s record of 18 major championships , despite the fact that the 20 - year - old @entity190 has yet to win a single one of golf ’s four big tournaments			2
but this kid is special , as he showed is so nearly becoming the youngest ever @entity88 champion in april			2
he also has good links experience from his days as a junior , can hit the ball low under the wind and has a magic short game			0
at 33 - 1 , @entity186 is one to watch			1
another man impossible to ignore is @entity214			0
if everything clicks , the @entity215 could blow away the field like one of the gales that often howl in here from the @entity221			0
but if the wind does pick up , there are huge question marks over @entity214 ’s game			0
his bizarre friday funks also mean @entity214 ’s form is too erratic to risk a price of 16 - 1			1
one man heading under the radar this week is @entity231 ( 80 - 1 )			1
his open form is heading in exactly the right direction after top 10s in the last two years , including a dramatic late charge at @entity84 last summer			2
as @entity237 have proven , there is no better putter under pressure than @entity231			0
he has been worried by a painful wrist this week , but remember the old adage : beware the injured golfer			0
under the radar : @entity231 's @entity10 form is heading in the right direction after top 10s in the last two years the only thing hurting @entity166 ( 25 - 1 ) recently is his failure to add to his @entity10 title from @entity250 in 2010			1
the 34 - year - old grew up on links golf in @entity253 and came very close to the @entity12 two summers ago just up the road from here at @entity257			1
a springtime break and his recent marriage have left @entity166 happy with life and he looks to be approaching his prime as a golfer			0
oh , and he ’s also deadly on the greens			0
any of these men would be a worthy successor to @entity18 as champion at @entity5			2
oh , and what price was @entity18 , again ? course : royal @entity183 , par 72 , 7,312 yards			0
defending champion : @entity82 ( 25 - 1 ) bookies ’ favourite : @entity86 ( 14 - 1 ) main man : @entity91 ( 14 - 1 ) @entity274 : @entity166 ( 25 - 1 ) @entity115 ( 25 - 1 ) @entity186 ( 33 - 1 ) @entity231 ( 80 - 1 ) bet now with @entity275 !			1

@entity91 ( 14 - 1 ) looks the best bet of the favourites for the @entity279
coral place @entity86 ( currently 14 - 1 ) as favourite to lift @entity12
defending champion @entity82 ( 25 - 1 ) has *n't* putted well of late
@entity115 ( 25/1 ) is outstanding value from @entity275
