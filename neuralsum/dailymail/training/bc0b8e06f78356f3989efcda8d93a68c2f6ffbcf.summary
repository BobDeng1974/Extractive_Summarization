by @entity0 every smoker knows their habit is not doing their health any favours			0
but many make themselves feel better by convincing themselves they are just light , social smokers			0
now , there is bad news for these people - a shocking new video has revealed the horrific damage just 60 cigarettes can do to a person ’s lungs			2
image shows a set of healthy lungs ( left ) and ( right ) a pair of lungs that have smoked just 60 normal cigarettes a teacher at @entity29 , in @entity30 , made the video after becoming concerned about the number of secondary school students taking up the habit			1
@entity35 made the video , which he posted on @entity37 , as a way of showing young people how damaging the habit is			2
it shows an air pump inflating two sets of pigs ’ lungs as though they are breathing			2
both pairs of lungs are completely healthy at the start of the experiment			0
however , one set is allowed to ‘ breathe ’ clean air , while the other ‘ smokes ’ 60 cigarettes			1
at the end of the experiment , mr @entity35 compares the two sets of lungs			0
the video also shows that after just 60 cigarettes the windpipe has been stained brown it is obvious to the naked eye that the lungs exposed to cigarette smoke have become seriously discoloured			1
indeed , while the non-smoking lungs remain a healthy pink colour , the smoking ones have taken on a yellowish - brown hue			0
in the film , mr @entity35 also dissects the pigs ’ windpipes and reveals that the non-smoking lungs have a healthy , pale pink trachea while the smoking lungs ’ windpipe is clogged and stained a dark shade of brown .			1

@entity35 , a teacher in @entity30 , made the video to show students how dangerous smoking is after becoming concerned by his students starting
shows two sets of lungs - one ' *inhaling* ' clean air and the other ' smoking '
after the ' smoking ' lungs have had 60 cigarettes , the lungs are compared
the ' smoking ' ones are clearly discoloured and have turned yellow
the ' smoking ' lungs also have a *blocked* and stained windpipe
