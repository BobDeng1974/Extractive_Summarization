it may sound like something from 2011 thriller @entity3 , but researchers have discovered a pill that helps adults learn new skills as quickly as children			1
a professor at @entity10 rewired the brain of a visually impaired women to process images by giving her @entity15 ’s drug donepezil			1
the pill boosts chemicals in the brain , such as serotonin and acetylcholine , which are both found in high concentrations in the brains of young children			1
in 2011 thriller @entity3 , @entity24 , pictured centre , takes a pill that opens up closed regions of his brain			0
this boost his intelligence , motor skills and ability to learn new languages these chemicals naturally reduce with age			1
children under seven develop new skills rapidly because their brains go through what ’s called ‘ critical periods ’ of development			1
due to high levels of certain chemicals and the fast growth of the brain , young children learn new languages , absorb information and pick up musical skills , for example , much faster than adults			1
in adults , these skills become harder as the brain reaches peak development and loses this ‘ elasticity ’			1
in @entity3 , @entity24 takes a pill that opens up closed regions of his brain to boost his intelligence , motor skills and more			2
the drug donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor			2
this means it increases the amount of acetylcholine around nerve endings and helps boost brain function			1
professor @entity65 gave donepezil to a 14 - year - old girl called @entity68 , a patient at the @entity69			2
@entity68 has a condition called amblyopia that impairs her vision , also known as a ‘ lazy eye			0
’ children develop new skills rapidly as their brains go through ' critical periods ' of development			1
this means they learn new languages , absorb information and pick up musical skills much faster than adults			2
in adults , these skills become harder as the brain reaches peak development and loses this ' elasticity ' in december , professor @entity65 used an epilepsy drug called valproate to teach tone - deaf adults how to pick out different musical notes			1
the men who took part in the experiment had no musical training as children and were asked to perform online tasks to train their ears			0
after two weeks of the exercises , they were tested on their ability to differentiate tones to see if the training had more effect than it typically does for men of their age			0
participants who took valproate were able to correctly identify an average of 5.09 notes , while people in a control group could only identify 3.5			0
following tests with donepezil , @entity68 was able to process images with her affected eye , in the same way a newborn would			1
in december , professor @entity65 similarly used an epilepsy drug called valproate to teach tone - deaf adults how to pick out different musical notes			0
participants who took the valproate were able to correctly identify an average of 5.09 notes , while people in a control group could only identify 3.5			0
‘ the brain is not losing its plasticity forever as we grow older , ’ professor @entity65 told the @entity125			2
‘ instead , it throws on the brakes at certain times			0
it ’s the brain ’s job to be elastic , and it wants to rewire			0
' but through evolution , it ’s created a lot of molecules to make sure it does n’t rewire too much			0
’ he continued : ‘ much of our adult behaviour reflects the neural circuits sculpted by experience in infancy and early childhood			0
‘ at no other time in life does the surrounding environment so potently shape brain function - from basic motor skills , sensation or sleep to higher cognitive processes like language			2
‘ how this plasticity waxes and wanes with age carries an impact far beyond neuroscience , including education policy , therapeutic approaches to developmental disorders or strategies for recovery from brain injury in adulthood			0

@entity165 is used to *improve* *memory* function in @entity15 ’s patients
children learn skills quickly as their brains go through ' critical periods ’
researchers found donepezil can revert adult brains to these periods
it increases the ' elasticity ' of the brain making it capable of learning rapidly
researchers rewired a visually impaired patient ’s brain to process images
the drug works by boosting chemicals in the brain that reduce with age
