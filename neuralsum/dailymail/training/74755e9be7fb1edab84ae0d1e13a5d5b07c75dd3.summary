but the @entity5 is also fond of a good bargain – and can be found rifling through the 60 per cent off sale rack at @entity9 designer outlet village in @entity10 , according to sales guru @entity11			1
having trawled the world 's shopping outlets , @entity11 had it confirmed that the future queen of @entity16 is particularly fond of sales at @entity19 high - street store @entity20			1
during a visit to @entity9 in february while doing research for his new book , @entity23 : how to shop in a @entity25 , @entity11 told @entity26 : ' i went into @entity20 to buy a sweater i bought at retail in navy , and they had it in brown for £ 20			1
bargain - hunter : @entity34 of @entity35 can be found rifling through the 60 per cent off sale rack at @entity9 designer outlet village in @entity10 , according to sales guru @entity11 ' i got chatting to a beautiful @entity16 rose behind the counter and asked why they were so many @entity41 shoppers in the store - there are no @entity20 stores in @entity41 - and she said : " oh , it ’s @entity5 – she ’s in here all the time			1
" ' she said , " you look up and there ’ll be @entity5 and her same two friends going through the 60 per cent off rack			1
you have no idea she 's there and security must be outside , but she comes in all the time			2
and she 's totally different to the prince of @entity55 , who i heard shut down a restaurant and brought his own staff when he visited @entity9			2
" ' it ’s not the first time that the @entity5 has been linked with @entity9			2
speaking to @entity62 , the wife of @entity64 senior parliamentary secretary for the ministry of defence , @entity66 , on the first day of her and the @entity35 's nine - day tour of the @entity68 last september , the new mother said she ' loved ' the discount shopping destination as ' everything is so contained			1
' tourist central : @entity41 shoppers flock to @entity20 's outlet at @entity74 , in order to catch a glimpse of @entity5 while in march 2012 it was revealed that she had bought a stylish blue coat dress from the @entity80 outlet shop in the village , as well as a scarf			0
at the time an assistant at the store told @entity85 : ' @entity5 bought the dress here			0
we were all surprised to see her and it was great to see her wearing it alongside the @entity91 and @entity92			0
' @entity11 said : ' the future queen of @entity16 ca n't take anything free , she can not endorse anything			1
' i love this image of people going to @entity9 and getting a sighting of the future queen of @entity16			0
' ' you look up and there ’ll be @entity5 and her same two friends going through the 60 per cent off rack ' and it 's not just the @entity5 who loves a bargain , as @entity11 points out : ' @entity107 tweeted , " why do people look at me like i 'm crazy when i use coupons at grocery or try bargaining at retail , @entity113 from @entity115 @entity114 [ sic ] " ' delving into celebrity shopping secrets , @entity11 said : ' a friend of mine used to work at @entity119 and @entity120 is one of the biggest clients at their boutique and also at their sample sale			1
' ' but what @entity120 would do is send a flunkey to send in line for the sample sale and they had to call when they were near the front and then @entity120 would take their place in line and go in			0
@entity135 staples : @entity34 of @entity35 pictured wearing a @entity20 design from 2010 in october 2012 ( left ) and a favourite blue dress in march 2012 ( right ) high profile moments : @entity34 wore a @entity20 dress to meet with @entity140 in january 2012 ( left ) and her engagement photo dress , also @entity20 , on tour in @entity143 in july 2011 ( right ) ' it 's getting mad now			0
with the @entity147 sale , there 's not just a vip day , but a celebrity day , there were pap shots of @entity152 carrying bags and bags away			0
and this sample sale is the @entity156 of sample sales			0
' however , when it comes to one celeb who wo n't take a freebie , @entity11 said : ' another friend of mine styled @entity163 and she tried on a bracelet and said " this is beautiful " – this is normally celebrity code for " give it to me "			1
but she said : " how much is it , " he replied $ 50,000 and she said " could you work on the price and invoice us ? " – she paid for everything			1
' @entity173 - born @entity11 was inspired to pen his book after noticing the steady stream of sales in stores			1
he said : ' ten years ago , retailers sold between 10 and 15 per cent of their inventory at some sort of promotion - today they sell between 40 and 45 per cent at promotion			1
shopping guru : paying full price is so passé , says @entity11 ' i was walking around and seeing lots of sales signs and when i shopped online i felt like an idiot if i had n't found a coupon code , somehow i felt robbed ! i wanted to know if there was something behind this and went to a researcher who gave me the numbers and i felt this was a fascinating story of how sales have doubled and why this has happened			1
' he joked : ' my mother 's @entity200 , she puts two five pound notes in her wallet and she thinks they 're like giant pandas and if she looks away they might breed ! i grew up very comfortably , but my mother takes great pride in her value driven - ness , she 's very @entity200			1
' during his research for his book , @entity11 said he discovered : ' there is no reason to pay full price ever and there is no reason to accept full price – and if you do , you 're a fool			1
you can always find a way to get a legal discount			2
do you pay cash ? do you ask nicely ? there is always an angle			2
' it was after moving to @entity115 from @entity226 15 years ago that @entity11 discovered his passion for a bargain at the @entity229 in @entity230 , where you can find ' dusty half - price books '			1
and it was n't long after that that he discovered the shopping nirvana that is @entity236 in the city			0
he revealed : ' i go to @entity236 twice a year , the first two weeks of february and the first two week of august			0
that 's when the showrooms clear out the backlog of that season 's inventory			0
twice a year it 's a piñata of goodies … the rest of the year go for towels and socks ! ' you go three times a week at 8.30am you go and look only for the names of the brands that you like - you do n't browse - buy everything you like in any size that might fit and take it home			2
at the end of two weeks , go through everything you 've bought , try it on and then take back whatever does n't fit			0
' when it comes to online shopping , @entity11 has a tried and tested formula : ' it 's cart abandonment			1
you have to treat shopping online like a date with someone new and cute , you must n't put out on the first date			0
instead , put the item in the cart , close the window , wait for it to go on sale and you 'll create your own bargain			0
' discount queens : @entity11 reveals that both @entity107 ( left ) and @entity120 ( right ) are fond of a bargain in exploring the world of bargains , @entity11 also unveiled the ploys that major ' high end middle market ' chains use to draw shoppers			1
using @entity280 as an example , he said : ' @entity280 is one of my favorite brands , but they have decoy products in their stores , which exist solely to make everything else seem cheaper			0
' @entity280 launched the @entity280 collection with a $ 900 blouse and everyone asked , " who would buy that ? " but @entity293 's going to buy it – it 's not meant to sell , it 's meant to make the $ 200 blouses that used to be $ 150 seem cheaper			2
' @entity280 puts expensive decoy products in stores , which exist solely to make everything else seem cheaper ' ' the @entity280 collection is sprinkled throughout the stores , with the $ 350 dress next to the $ 200 dress to make it look cheaper			0
shoppers are being manipulated and you have to be aware			0
' we have this crazy irrational reaction to money - we do n't think logically			2
if you get $ 5 off something , that goes into a magical pot that 's no longer real money , you can spend it on anything ... if it was still in your bank account you 'd treat it like normal money , but this is weird bonus money			0
' he advised : ' every sales assistant wants to make their four per cent commission and you have to start thinking " they want to sell me this			2
" ' start visiting your favourite stores , make friends , learn when the assistants work and buy a little cheap thing , full price			1
they need to know that if they look after you they will have a guaranteed sales stream			0
' then they 'll invite you to the pre-sale , which is the secret sale that happens before the sale			0
by the time the sale signs go up now anything good is gone			0
so pre-sale you take your loyalists and you offer the sale to them			0
' there is always a discount to be had			2
' set sale : bargain fever by @entity11 goes on sale in the @entity350 on thursday			1

@entity11 says 40 - 45 per cent of retailers ' stock is now sold at a discount - a decade ago it was just 10 - 15 per cent
he says there is no reason to pay full price ever and there is no reason to accept full price – and if you do , you 're a fool
