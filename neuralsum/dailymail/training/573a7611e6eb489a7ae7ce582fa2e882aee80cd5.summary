tragedy : the baby 's mother @entity10 woke up in @entity15 to be told her boy had died speaking at an inquest at @entity25 on monday , ms @entity21 , who is originally from @entity23 , said they were preparing to go to baby yoga			1
she said : ' i remember taking him to the bathroom and washing his hair			1
i remember nothing after that			2
all i remember is being woken up and told i was at @entity15			1
' mum - of - three @entity10 , who is aged in her later thirties or early forties , suffers from a form of epilepsy which usually manifests itself in the form of ‘ jerks ’			2
she said : ' i was the happiest i ’ve ever been in my life			2
' i do not understand why something like this could happen			2
it ’s beyond comprehension , it ’s inconceivable			2
' for the life of me i ca n’t understand how there was nothing wrong with me one minute and the next minute i ’m totally out of it			2
' the inquest heard that @entity51 , born on june 1 , 2011 , died at @entity15 where he was taken by ambulance after being discoveredby family friend @entity53			1
mrs @entity53 , also of @entity6 , said : ' i opened the door and heard what i thought was a baby crying or a wail - indescribable noises coming from upstairs			1
' i found ( ms @entity21 ) on the bathroom floor , it was in total disarray			1
i looked at @entity10 and tried to get some sense out of her			0
she was sat on the floor rocking and her eyes were rolling back into her head			0
' i looked over the side of the bath and saw the baby lying face down			1
' dr @entity70 , consultant neurologist , said it is likely @entity10 suffered an unusually severe epileptic fit , which could have beenaggravated by changes in hormones and medication			0
she said : ' i think it would be very much in keeping that the behavioural disturbance and subsequent amnesia was due to a prolonged seizure			0
' @entity80 , forensic pathologist , confirmed drowning was the most likely cause of death in the absence of any other medical evidence			0
he said : ' immersion is a reasonable explanation			0
the fact that the baby was in water is why he has died			1
