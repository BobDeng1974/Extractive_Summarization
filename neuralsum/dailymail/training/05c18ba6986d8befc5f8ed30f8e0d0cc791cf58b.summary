by @entity0 @entity2 ’s leading scientists have named the top 20 most important innovations in the history of food and drink - with fridges , pasteurised milk and tin cans topping the list			1
the modern innovations beat ancient inventions like the fishing net , the plough , and the cork , without which our ancestors would have struggled to survive			1
refrigeration came out on top , while vital methods for food preparation like the pot , the knife and the spoon came 14th , 15th and 16th respectively			1
refrigeration was named at the most important breakthrough in food and drink by 75 of @entity2 's top scientists			1
a team of 45 top scientists from the @entity31 ranked a shortlist of 20 innovations by their levels of accessibility , productivity , aesthetics and health			1
the group of @entity40 , chaired by @entity31 treasurer sir @entity41 , decided two of the top three discoveries were made in @entity2 - artificial refrigeration was first demonstrated in @entity45 in 1748 , and a @entity2 merchant patented the tin can in 1810			1
however , the first pasteurisation test was completed in @entity49 in 1862			0
sir @entity41 said : ' @entity50 have played vital roles in improving people ’s lives for 350 years and science has a major role to play in meeting the global challenges of the 21st century			0
' we thought it appropriate to look at how that innovation has shaped what we eat and drink			2
the tin can was also voted among the most important inventions in food and drink ' the poll reveals the huge role science and innovation have played in improving our health and our lives			1
' this is something to which the scientific community continues to add			0
' refrigeration allows food to be kept fresher for longer , allowing people without a large garden to eat a more varied and more nutritious diet			2
the first known artificial refrigeration was demonstrated by @entity78 at the @entity45 , but they were first introduced into homes in the 1920 ’s			0
the @entity31 said : ' refrigeration has played the biggest role of any innovation in improving the diets of millions of people			2
' it is responsible for bringing a more varied , interesting , nutritious and more affordable diet to an ever increasing number of people			0
' @entity87 is the process of heating food to a specific temperature to kill bacteria inside and prevent spoilage , and was first used to heat wine in @entity94 in 1117			2
modern pasteurisation , including immediate cooling , was created by famous microbiologist @entity97 - who was also a pioneer for vaccination			0
the @entity31 said : ' improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other foodborne disease outbreak , making it one of the most potentially dangerous food products			0
' @entity104 provided a way of preserving all sorts of food , and also makes it easy to be transported			0
@entity2 merchant @entity109 invented and patented the tin can in 1810 , and three years later the @entity2 ’s first commercial canning factory was opened - but the can opener was not invented until 50 years @entity114 became the first canned beer in 1935			1
