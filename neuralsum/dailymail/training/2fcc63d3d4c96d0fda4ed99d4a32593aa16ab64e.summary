she might be a member of one of @entity3 's leading royal dynasties but @entity5 @entity4 of @entity6 is happy to forgo most of the trappings			2
the 42 - year - old arrived for a cancer charity event this morning on foot , having been dropped off in a nearby car park alone and without security guards			1
despite the lack of frills , she was every inch the style queen in her tyrian purple coat and fashionable aviator sunglasses			0
low key : queen @entity4 arrives for a meeting held by the @entity20 in @entity21 carrying a black briefcase , the royal looked businesslike as she made her way into the meeting held by the @entity20 , a charity of which she is patron			2
her low key approach is yet another sign of the increasingly @entity30 style of the @entity6 monarchy , which has so far seen @entity32 prioritise being seen as ' normal ' over the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by his father @entity34			1
his latest move came last thursday , when he banned senior royals , including himself , his two daughters and @entity4 , from accepting expensive gifts			2
the new rules , which also apply to @entity34 and his wife @entity41 , come into effect on @entity43 and are intended to avoid ' compromising the dignity of the institution '			0
@entity32 's move comes after his father 's reign was blighted by accusations of extravagance - not helped by his habit of accepting gifts that included an € 18m ( £ 14m ) yacht			1
alone : she was dropped off in a nearby car park ahead of the event and arrived without a security detail businesslike : she teamed her tyrian purple coat with a pair of fashionable aviator sunglasses new look : @entity32 recently banned any member of the @entity6 royal family from accepting gifts @entity66 , which @entity34 was forced to stop using last year in a nod to austerity , became a regular plaything of the @entity6 royals , who used it during summer holidays in @entity73			1
@entity32 's new - look @entity6 monarchy is closer in style to the @entity30 system , which sees members of the royal family live relatively low key lifestyles			1
as part of his drive to modernise the institution , the 46 - year - old royal also banned members of his family from working in the private sector and insisted that all must behave in an ' exemplary manner ' likely to ' earn citizens ' appreciation , respect and trust			0
' despite boasting fewer staff and less money than their @entity101 and @entity6 counterparts , the @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 monarchs and their families do accept gifts , although like the @entity101 royals , most have to be declared			0
transformation : @entity32 is attempting to remodel the @entity6 royal family along @entity30 lines change : his move comes after @entity34 ' reign was blighted by accusations of extravagance in the case of the @entity101 royal family , gifts either become part of the @entity114 and are displayed during the summer exhibition season or are donated to the relevant museum or institution			1
although the @entity5 is yet to benefit from a free flight or a yacht like @entity34 , she has received a number of unusual gifts on state visits , including a collection of shells , a set of lacrosse sticks , sunglasses , a pair of sandals , pineapples , eggs , a box of snail shells , a grove of maple trees , a dozen tins of of tuna and 7kg of prawns			0
