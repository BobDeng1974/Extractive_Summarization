@entity0 has spent almost three years traveling the world - and it has n't cost him a cent			1
the 26 - year - old from @entity5 has managed his globe - trotting adventure by trading his skills as a photographer for everything he needs , from food to shelter and transport			1
' if someone told you that you can get around the world without spending a cent , they would tell you it 's not possible			0
unless , that is , if you can change your perception and allow yourself to create different rules and a different way of thinking , ' mr @entity0 told @entity24			1
a breathtaking shot of the @entity36 's @entity35 which are giving new life to on an old navy yard before he started out , he was told it was n't possible to travel the globe using only the ' bartering economy			2
' but he set off anyway , with no currency and contracts - just a camera and ' an eager smile			2
' starting his career as a freelance photographer , mr @entity0 said modern day workplaces tended to funnel creative people like himself into specialties , where what was he was looking for was diversity			1
he decided to take off on the journey of a lifetime taking money out of the conversation and allowing his creative pursuits to take precedence			1
' money can really hinder creativity , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' anything can seem possible without applying that restriction , ' he added			0
mr @entity0 claims that by eliminating money from his travels he 's been able to connect on a different level creatively with his clients			1
' the real gem that comes from trading is how we can start to do more creative work with others , without the conversation focusing on money			1
' mr @entity0 likens his philosophy to that of companies like @entity77 and @entity78 where there is no cash exchange between clients and more focus on personal interaction			1
' really , an uber driver is no different to a taxi driver			0
the huge difference is , that at the end of the day , you are being dropped at the airport like a relative is dropping you off			0
it 's like being dropped to a restaurant by a friend			0
' diversity is exquisite : mr @entity0 's unofficial mantra leads him to photograph a diverse range of subjects with 197 trades under his belt mr @entity0 's travels have spanned 6 continents with @entity102 in his sights mr @entity0 , who often stays in the homes of his clients , has become accustom to the nomadic lifestyle			1
he says after almost three years of house hopping , it takes longer for his host to get comfortable than he does			0
' people often tell their guests to make themselves at home and i think i put them at ease by being so comfortable			0
' ' it takes me about two minutes to be drinking milk out of the carton , even if i have just met you two minutes ago			0
i walk into a home , and i am home , ' he added			0
the nomadic photographer insists that by taking money out of the equation we can allow ourselves to make a genuine human connection mr @entity0 said he does n't ask for much and has never discussed the details of exactly what he would receive in a trade , leaving it up to his clients to pay with what they can			1
' i do n't have any expectations apart from hoping it 's good food and a comfortable bed , ' he said			2
with 197 trades under his belt mr @entity0 's travels have spanned 6 continents			1
he is adamant he will make it to @entity102 at some stage but at the moment he is inundated with requests for his services			2
mr @entity145 said he has spent a lot of time in @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and the @entity150 his portfolio has no limits as he dabbles in shooting food , weddings , travel , landscapes and cities ' sometimes i find it overwhelming			2
there are days or weeks where i do n't answer emails because i just ca n't			0
you could spend hours every day on email but i do n't want to get caught up in that every day			0
some days i just want to shoot or explore and interact with people			0
' mr @entity0 was surprised to find weddings to be some of his most enjoyable projects			2
' [ the wedding ] industry was very one dimensional , in my opinion , but luckily these days people are wanting a lot more from their wedding day			0
' initially finding the wedding industry ' one dimensional ' mr @entity0 said his perception could n't have changed more over his journey mr @entity145 started to see the raw human connection people have through celebrating a couples special day ' you end up celebrating your friend 's wedding , but they have only been your friend for a few days , it becomes quite intimate			1
' mr @entity0 said his journey has given him the opportunity to meet ' so many amazing people who have effected me in very different ways , ' but @entity190 and @entity191 's wedding changed everything for him			1
@entity190 and @entity191 , the beautiful couple from @entity194 who changed mr @entity0 's perception on weddings anything but traditional : lentil relishes in the beautiful day that was planned by her closest family and friends @entity190 and @entity191 make their vows standing barefoot on delicate yellow flower petals two days before the wedding he stayed with a group of their friends and prepared for the big day			1
this gave him the chance to become a part of the wedding instead of just taking record of it			0
' when the wedding day came they were like brother and sister to me			0
' they were the most open minded , beautiful people and i got to celebrate the two of them having their big love day , around their equally incredible friends and family			0
' after spending two days with the couples closest friends and family mr @entity0 says he became an organic part of the wedding mr @entity0 is currently in @entity231 photographing for a not - for - profit group who send @entity150 school leavers on a gap year to undertake community projects and live with local families			1
' there 's a real diversity in subject matter for me here			2
we go from farms , to schools , to beaches , ' he said			0
to mr @entity0 diversity was the reason he ventured out into the world and after photographing cook books , weddings , dancers , farms and cityscapes , he really has achieved it			2
' diversity is exquisite , it really is			0
