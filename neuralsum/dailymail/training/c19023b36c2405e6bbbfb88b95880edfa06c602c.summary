a girl thrown from a plane that crashed at @entity2 died before she was twice run over by fire trucks , according to a report issued by the city			1
it directly contradicts a coroner 's finding that the teen survived the crash and was killed by the fire vehicles			2
instead , the city said in a report obtained wednesday that 16 - year - old @entity14 died when she hit the ground after she was thrown from the back of an @entity18 jet that had its tail ripped off			1
killed : @entity14 , left , 16 , was hit by at least oner fire truck after the @entity18 plane crash			1
she died along with her schoolfriend @entity22 , right the conclusion was contained in a report the city filed with the @entity26			2
city officials say it is based on @entity26 reports and interviews by federal investigators ; the city did not conduct an autopsy or consult with medical experts			0
‘ we did our examination and we determined that the young lady was alive when she was struck by the fire trucks , ’ said @entity36 coroner @entity35			1
‘ the death certificate says what it says			0
if someone wants to put a spin on something , they can do that			0
’ no one disputes that @entity14 , 16 , was found dead on the ground after being thrown out the back of an @entity18 jet airliner that crashed at @entity2 last summer			1
and there 's agreement she was hit , twice , by fire trucks rushing to the scene			1
but a few weeks after the accident , @entity35 announced that the autopsy was complete and that she had been alive when she was hit , saying there was internal hemorrhaging that indicated her heart was still beating when the truck struck her			0
a dashboard camera aboard a @entity65 rig shows crash victim @entity14 , in the foreground and partially obscured by foam			0
the rig ran over miss @entity14 seconds later only three of the 307 people aboard the jet died in the dramatic crash that sent the @entity72 tumbling across the tarmac with its tail torn off			2
the conclusion that she did not survive the initial crash was contained in a report the city filed with the @entity26 in january			2
city officials say they based their findings solely on @entity26 reports and interviews by federal investigators ; the city did not conduct an autopsy or consult with medical experts			0
the city said in its document that neither of two @entity26 reports noted dust , dirt , debris or firefighting foam in @entity98 's trachea or lung tissues			1
the city also said that @entity26 investigators found she had not buckled her seatbelt for the landing , based on interviews with survivors and an inspection that found her seatbelt attached and unbuckled			0
families of @entity98 and the two other victims have filed a claim against the city saying emergency workers were incompetent			2
highlighted : a camera aboard ' @entity115 ' shows a firefighter directing the truck around @entity14 on the ground - 15 minutes later he would run her over miss @entity14 's body lies covered in foam as firefighters battle to put out the flames from the crashed @entity18 plane on july 6 last year their attorney @entity123 said lawyers reviewed the city 's findings about the death ‘ and we do not agree			1
’ the city 's report , prepared by airport and fire department officials , is one of hundreds of documents the @entity26 will review before concluding its accident investigation			1
some of those @entity26 documents describe how after the crash , @entity98 was struck twice by emergency vehicles on the runway — once by a fire rig spraying foam and again 11 minutes later by a second truck that was turning around to fetch water			2
firefighters told authorities she appeared to be dead — she was covered with dust , silent , not moving — so they raced on toward the fire			0
the @entity26 records included some excerpts from the coroner 's report but no information about when or how the girl died			1
@entity2 airport spokesman @entity154 said officials with the facility did n't intend to dispute the coroner 's conclusion but had depended solely on @entity26 records to conclude the girl had died when she hit the ground			1
crash landing : an aerial view of an @entity18 @entity72 plane is seen after it crashed while landing at @entity2 in @entity164 in july best of friend : @entity14 and @entity166 , both 16 , died when the @entity72 passenger jet slammed into a seawall while attempting to land @entity26 spokesman @entity170 said agency officials do not put personal information such as causes of death in their public files , but @entity2 officials could have looked at the coroner 's reports			1
aviation attorney @entity179 , whose firm is suing the airline and aircraft manufacturer on behalf of 14 survivors , said city officials are trying to avoid hefty payouts and are not going to admit anything in public records that could later be used against them			0
‘ the city has an ax to grind here because their liability could hang in the balance of whether she was already dead or whether she was alive and they failed to move her to a safe place , ’ @entity189 , a law professor at @entity191 's @entity190 , said the city attorney 's document is one party 's version of what happened			0
the city says two things , @entity189 said : the girl was dead when she was run over			2
and even if she was n't dead , it 's not the city 's fault because things were so chaotic and dangerous when she was struck that no reasonable jury or judge could blame the city			0
‘ if you believe the city 's report , damages are going to be zero , ’ @entity189 said			2
‘ if you believe the coroner , the family is entitled to millions			0
’ @entity189 said there 's no surprise the city would try to cast the best possible light on itself and its performance that day and not concede any liability			0
from afar , @entity189 thinks it will be difficult to prove where the girl 's fatal injuries came from — the plane or fire trucks			1
the way she died does n't ease the emotional trauma at the @entity65 , where firefighters were shaken after rescuers drove over @entity98 two times , spokeswoman @entity236 said wednesday			1
‘ it does n't make it better or worse , really , ’ she said			0
‘ it 's just psychologically , it 's a difficult thing			0
