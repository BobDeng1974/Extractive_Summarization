intelligence chiefs are poring over footage of @entity2 ' to establish if he really has been injured in a @entity5 bombing raid - but have received ' no evidence ' so far that he was among those hit			1
the @entity10 killer , who orchestrated the horrific video showing the beheading of 16 @entity14 soldiers and the severed head of @entity5 hostage @entity16 , was said to have been wounded in the air strike on a convoy reported to have included @entity21 mastermind @entity20			1
but @entity22 understands that intelligence officers have no confirmation yet that he was on the convoy – or that he had been injured			2
the @entity26 has said it was aware of the ' report ' that he may have been injured but is awaiting confirmation			0
the news comes as new footage emerged showing @entity33 - the @entity34 rapper who was suspected of being ' @entity2 ' until intelligence chiefs ruled him out - blasting police tactics while being interviewed by an @entity38 news channel during the 2011 @entity34 riots			1
in the murder video , @entity2 appears not to be injured significantly the murder of former @entity5 ranger @entity16 – the fifth killing of a @entity54 ' is shown taking part in – appears to have been filmed after the @entity5 airstrike on november 8			1
the militant shows no obvious sign of injury and there has been speculation the killing of the @entity63 convert was in revenge for the convoy strike			2
security officials also say it is unlikely that ' @entity2 ' would be allowed to travel with the @entity21 leadership because his voice is so well known from the death videos where he spouts sickening jihadist propaganda			1
voice recognition technology used by both @entity10 and @entity74 could potentially identify him in a convoy triggering drone attack			0
this weekend is was claimed that the masked ' executioner ' narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the group 's leaders in an @entity83 town close to the @entity14 border last saturday			0
sickening : the latest @entity21 video showed a group of @entity14 soldiers being marched along a desert road in @entity89 and brutally murdered by a large number of unmasked militants unsettling : the video also shows the mass murder of @entity14 military personnel by beheading led by @entity2 at a desert location			1
unlike the murder of @entity99 hostages , the killing of the @entity14 is shown in full this weekend it was claimed that @entity2 had been injured in an airstrike targeting a convoy driving near the @entity83 town of @entity104 , close to the @entity14 border the previous saturday			1
it was claimed that both he and @entity21 leader @entity20 had been among a group of senior militants who attended a secret , heavily guarded meeting in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in the town			1
at least 30 tribal elders from various parts of @entity14 and @entity83 gathered to pledge allegiance to @entity118 , according to a well - placed @entity14 source			0
a source speaking to the @entity121 claimed that @entity2 goes by the name @entity123 and that he and the rest of those injured in the airstrikes - including @entity118 - were transported to a hospital in the city of @entity129			2
it is not clear how seriously the @entity10 fanatic was hurt , but the source said that both he and @entity133 were rushed to the @entity134 for treatment			0
@entity21 members apparently issued urgent calls through the local mosque 's loudspeakers , appealing for the town 's residents to donate blood at the hospital			0
the raid on november 8 was also thought to have injured the leader of @entity145 ( pictured ) sickening : @entity2 ( right ) was filmed murdering @entity5 journalists @entity147 ( left ) in august , and @entity148 ( right ) in september jihadi @entity2 was also responsible for killing @entity10 aid workers @entity151 ( left ) and @entity152 ( right ) the news comes as a new video emerged of @entity33 - the 24 year old @entity10 who was once the main suspect to be @entity2			1
although @entity33 is known to be fighting alongside @entity21 in @entity14 , and photographs have previously shown his posing with severed heads in the group 's de facto capital city @entity157 , intelligence chiefs are understood to have since ruled him out as the man in the terror group 's filmed murder videos			1
the footage - shot by @entity167 on saturday 6 august 2011 when rioting first broke out outside @entity169 police station - shows former rapper @entity33 in an agitated state as he rants to reporter @entity171 about police tactics			1
in footage aired today 's @entity167 bulletin , @entity171 is seen interviewing another man before @entity33 commands control of the microphone			0
' let me tell you something			0
the police are protecting the police station , they 're not protecting the people , ' @entity33 said			1
' a policeman said it out of his own words when i asked him ' why are you here ' ... he said i 'm here to protect the police , ' the rapper turned @entity189 extremist added			0
@entity191 reporter @entity171 ( right ) spoke to @entity33 ( left ) back in 2011 @entity33 took over when @entity171 was interviewing another man on the first night of riots in @entity169 @entity33 abandoned his burgeoning career as a rapper after becoming increasingly radicalised by extremist @entity189 and is believed to have travelled to @entity14 last year @entity171 told @entity167 he met @entity196 on the first night of the riots on the streets of @entity169 in @entity34			1
' there were hundreds of young people loitering near a burning building that police and firefighters were trying to control , ' he said			0
' there was a lot of friction and tension simmering on the streets and this group of young men crowded around me as i was filming a piece - to - camera			0
' @entity33 abandoned his burgeoning career as a rapper after becoming increasingly radicalised by extremist @entity189 and is believed to have travelled to @entity14 last year			0
earlier this year , he posted a photograph on @entity215 of himself holding up a decapitated head with the message ' chillin ' with my homie or what 's left of him '			0
the photograph is understood to have been taken in the terror group 's de facto capital city @entity157			2
@entity33 is the son of @entity196 - an @entity224 who recently admitted playing a role in the deadly @entity228 bombings of @entity5 embassies in @entity230 and @entity231			2

appearing in an @entity5 court in september , the 54 year old pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make a threat to use an explosive device , making a threat to use an explosive device , and conspiracy to murder @entity5 .			2
