by @entity0 when it comes to trying something new , one grandmother proves you 're never too old to start			2
for @entity5 , a 78 - year - old grandma from the @entity6 , knowing she was due to take her first ever flight , she was determined to conqeur her fear of flying by doing something a little closer to the ground			1
she decided to head to a theme park and take her first - ever roller coaster ride , figuring if she could take the twists and turns that it had to offer , flying would smooth - sailing by comparison			2
@entity5 , 78 , had a fear of heights but the coaster wiped those fears away upside down : the ride quickly gathers speed and flips 180 degrees laughing through life : throughout the ride , the grandmother never stops smiling as part of phone company @entity34 's first ad campaign , @entity5 clambered aboard the white - knuckle ride with a spring in her step and a smile on her face			1
she was accompanied by her granddaughter , @entity39 , who was sitting off - camera , as they ride @entity42 at @entity44 amusement park in @entity45 , @entity6			1
take it to the limit : a new ad campaign from @entity50 telecom provider @entity34 pushes people to experience something for the first time @entity5 has the time of her life laughing and screaming her way through the thirty second thrill ride @entity5 is from the @entity6 and has apparently found something new to love ! the experience is over almost as soon as it starts , but throughout the ride , which took just 45 - seconds , the smile did n't leave @entity5 's face once			1
as the coaster twists and turns its way along , @entity5 laughed , smiled and screamed with what appears to be joy ( though terror could easily have been mixed in ! ) her obvious enjoyment is wonderful to watch , particularly at the end of the ride , when she asks , ' how 's my hair ? ' the grandma closes the video by making sure she still looks good for the camera			1
the @entity6 grandma proves that there is no age limit on conquering your fears incredible : as the ride draws to a close , the grandma asks if she still looks good for the camera after the ride was all over , it was time for the big event with grandma @entity89 teaming up with another lady who had also never flown before			2
an @entity92 , 71 , also had a serious fear of flying and while @entity5 was riding her rollercoaster , mrs @entity95 prepared to get airbourne by taking part in a flight simulator ride			1
. @entity92 and @entity5 take to the skies for the first time in a private jet the two grandmothers , from the @entity6 , had never had the opportunity , or been too scared , to fly before @entity103 , 71 , had a fear of flying while @entity5 , 78 , had never had the opportunity to fly because her husband had a fear of heights they have now taken their first plane trip in style however , travelling by private jet from @entity114 's @entity113 to @entity115 the women took their first plane trip in style , travelling by private jet from @entity114 's @entity113 to @entity115			1
before the journey , @entity103 had revealed that she also had a deep - seated fear of flying			2
she said : ' you would n't get me in one of those for any amount of money			0
i will just take the bus			0
' just before her 72nd birthday however she decided to take part in the trip			0
she said : ' if i do n’t do this now , i never will			0
sometimes opportunities come by in life that you just have to take			0
' @entity5 , on the other hand , had only travelled with her late husband who had a fear of heights			1
@entity5 , 78 , prepares for her first - ever flight by taking a rollercoaster ride @entity103 , 71 , attempts to calm her nerves by taking a flight simulator ride an and @entity5 step onto the tarmac as they prepare to board their first - ever plane journey @entity5 and @entity103 accepted @entity34 's challenge of taking their first - ever flight together , sharing an experience that left them close friends she found a new travel companion when she was partnered with @entity154 through the programme , which helps people do remarkable things for the first time			1
she said : ' i ’ve now got this opportunity , but otherwise i do n’t think i would have ever flown			0
' an and @entity89 's flight was captured on film as they marvelled at the beauty of the view from the jet 's windows and enjoyed the @entity168 on offer			0
on an emotional videocall at the end of the flight , @entity103 tells her husband : ' it was a lot of fun			0
i really enjoyed it and the other lady ’s so kind			0
it ’s just like a dream			0
