@entity0 warned on thursday he will ditch @entity2 players who say they are too tired to train as the fall - out continued from last month ’s @entity5 rumpus			1
@entity5 was axed from the @entity7 qualifying win in @entity8 after complaining of fatigue			1
and in a clear message ahead of the @entity12 clash at home on november 15 and the friendly against @entity15 three days later , @entity0 said he would not tolerate any similar episodes			1
@entity2 ’s head coach , who called @entity19 striker @entity18 into the senior squad for the first time on thursday , also criticised the @entity22 for allowing an american football match to be played at @entity24 on sunday			1

@entity0 added : ‘ unfortunately i have 30 witnesses and @entity29 was not there			1
if that ’s all it is , he got the wrong end of the stick and i would be happy to put him right and i would be happy to talk to him about it			2
@entity29 is no longer on speaking terms with @entity0 after the @entity5 saga @entity18 's impressive start to the season has earned him a call - up to the @entity2 suad ‘ he ( @entity5 ) came just before we started training			1
i never said @entity5 said he was too tired to play			1
he did play and got us the free - kick which won the game			0
i said he said he was too tired before training and as a result i left him out of the team			2
’ @entity0 was in a cranky mood at times on thursday and the state of the @entity24 pitch was among his bugbears			1
the @entity22 have hired out the stadium for another american football match , this time between @entity69 and @entity70 , just six days before @entity2 play @entity12			2
the 67 - year - old said : ‘ i am a football coach , a football manager , not @entity72			2
i do n’t really think you could expect me to say , “ excellent , delighted , well done ”			0
but i ’m realistic , i ’m pragmatic and this match has been organised for a period of time now			0
‘ the pitch , unfortunately , is not in the best of nick anyway , which we ’re all a bit unhappy with			0
i am not exactly jumping for joy			0
but at this particular moment i would honestly have to say if asked if it was a good thing or not , i would have to say not			0
‘ i can do nothing about it and we wo n’t use it as an excuse			0
we will get on with it			0
hopefully in the future the pitch will recover to its normal level and when it has done that we will be better able to support this type of activity			0
’ although @entity0 put pressure on @entity2 managing director @entity94 to find a solution , the @entity22 have already agreed to stage a series of american football games next year			1
@entity98 and @entity99 face each other on october 4 , five days before the return @entity7 qualifier against @entity8			0

the striker ’s rise has been extraordinary			0
he arrived in @entity2 from @entity108 aged 10 to join his mum and sisters after his father was killed in the civil @entity112 he scored against @entity113 for @entity2 ’s under 21 team , he lifted his shirt to reveal the words : ‘ rip , love u dad ’			2

’ @entity0 also revealed that right back @entity131 has slipped behind @entity132 and @entity133 in the pecking order			2
‘ i have n’t spoken to @entity135 and i do n’t always speak to players that i do n’t select in the squad , ’ @entity0 added			1
