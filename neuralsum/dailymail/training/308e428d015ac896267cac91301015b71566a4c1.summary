there was something quite striking when @entity2 held up four fingers at @entity4 on the way to the @entity6 in @entity7			1
@entity9 ’s coach , targeting the country ’s fourth title in sunday ’s final , either had balls of steel or he was one of the biggest bluffers in the game			2
on tuesday , we discovered that @entity9 are putting the finishing touches to a world - class team after beating @entity7 7 - 1 in stunning fashion			1
‘ this is one of the strongest squads i ’ve ever played in and we have two excellent players in each position , ’ said @entity35 defender @entity34			0
‘ this all started with the youth academies developing well in the last five or six years			2
‘ it started off in 2009 when we won the under 21 tournament and beat @entity45 4 - 0 , i think			1
that was a real turning point and five or six players from that team are doing well here			2
‘ there ’s a small link between these two tournaments			0
that was five years ago , but overall you have to create a team spirit and with those magnificent players growing up together it makes it easier			0
’ this giant of a defender has been forced out of the team , a substitute during the destruction of @entity7 after @entity2 ’s defensive reshuffle following the 2 - 1 victory over @entity65			1
success : six of under 21 side who thrashed @entity45 in 2009 final were in @entity2 's side against @entity7 after that stodgy second round win in @entity71 , @entity34 responded to criticism of the team ’s performance by claiming they are ‘ not some @entity77 team ’			1
everybody is taking them seriously			0
at some stage , probably when it is far too late , the wise men at the @entity81 will look back at the fork in the road at the 2009 @entity87 21 final			1
it was in the @entity89 when @entity45 lost 4 - 0 in the final and they were not just beaten			1
six players from that under 21 team — goalkeeper @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 — started the semi-final for @entity9			1
@entity102 is the only player from that @entity45 batch to make it into @entity106 ’s squad for their disastrous @entity6 campaign here			1
they arrived at this tournament unbeaten in 15 games and their mission statement was to deliver the @entity6 for the people back home			2
they have been waiting since 1990			0
deadly : @entity9 thrashed @entity45 in the final of under 21 @entity87 in 2009 they are a powerful combination , moving the ball around the pitch with purpose and belief that they are better than the opposition			1
‘ everyone is capable of playing and , as you could see , all of the players who came on were magnificent , ’ added @entity34			0
‘ we ’ve found the team spirit as well during the tournament and that makes the difference			0
’ @entity22 , the @entity130 forward who came off the bench to round off @entity9 ’s victory with two magnificent goals on tuesday , said : ‘ the people back home are desperate for us to win			2
if you see the pictures , in every big city there are thousands , hundreds of thousands , watching every match			0
they want to see something			0
we want to give them something			0
’ on sunday , inside the @entity146 , they expect to deliver			0
quiet night : @entity9 keeper @entity92 ( left ) was one of the players to move up from under 21 side goals galore : @entity27 ( right ) celebrates after scoring @entity9 's third against @entity7			2

six of under 21 team who won @entity87 in 2009 started against @entity7
