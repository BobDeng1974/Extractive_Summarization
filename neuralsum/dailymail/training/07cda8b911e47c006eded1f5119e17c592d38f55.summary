emotional rescue : the dramatic moment when @entity3 emerged , covered in mud , after being trapped down a well for three hours once the rescue time arrived it took 45 minutes to get young @entity3 back to the surface			1

the rescue was n’t without its problems			0
the hole was just large enough for the young girl to fall down but not big enough for an adult to fit down , so instead the rescue team had to use a harness			1
that meant placing a lot of responsibility on young @entity3 ’s shoulders @entity35 speaks to the media the day after her ordeal , with her doll @entity39 for support ' just her age and maturity , would she be able to follow the instructions to get into the harness ? and once we got her into the harness , it was just trying to keep her calm while we got her out , ' @entity45 of the @entity46 told @entity52			1
another obstacle was that the girl was stuck in mud at the bottom of the hole and so once she was in a harness it took several attempts to get her unstuck and moving up the shaft			2
