the sun is entering an unusually heavy period of solar activity , and the poor planet earth is bearing the brunt of it			1
luckily for us earthlings , any disturbance we experienced from the latest outbursts were simply an extraordinary display of the aurora borealis , or the @entity12			2
the spectacular lights display , caused by radiation hitting the upper reaches of our atmosphere , are not being true to their name after being seen as far south as @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 in the @entity23 which , relative to @entity24 , are about as far @entity26 as southern @entity27 and the @entity28			1
solar flares : a @entity24 visitor to the @entity31 , @entity32 , took these pictures of the aurora , much further south than they should be @entity36 were seen as far south as @entity37 , @entity22			2
this photo was taken by a camper on the shores of @entity41 , facing north the speckled face of the sun : these sunspots , particularly 1504 , have peaked over the last few days in the early hours of saturday morning , the combined effects of two coronal mass ejections from a sunspot which @entity48 named @entity49 , passed @entity48 's @entity50 ( @entity50 ) spacecraft on the way toward @entity54 's protective magnetic bubble , the magnetosphere			1
@entity50 is approximately 900,000 miles from @entity54 and can detect such incoming shocks about 30 - 45 minutes before they hit the magnetosphere - a handy early - warning system			1
simulations performed at @entity60 's @entity59 indicate that the disturbance strongly compressed the magnetopause , ultimately to a minimum of approximately 24,000 miles from @entity54 's surface at 6:28 pm edt			1
this is an altitude some 2,000 miles lower than spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit			0
the @entity68 captured this image of an @entity71 class flare on june 13 , 2012			0
the sun is shown here in teal as this is the color typically used to represent light in the 131 @entity77 wavelength , a wavelength particularly good for observing flares the changing shape of @entity54 's magnetopause also influenced the aurora , causing bright aurora to be seen at lower latitudes than normal			1
an active region on the sun , numbered @entity49 , rotated into view over the left side of the sun on june 10 , 2012			0
the region fired off flares and two coronal mass ejections on june 13 and june 14 , 2012			0
the first flare lasted for a relatively long three hours , peaking on june 13 , 2012			0
the associated @entity93 traveled at approximately 375 miles per second and is directed toward @entity54			1
the second m - class flare was also a long - duration flare , and it peaked on june 14 , 2012			0
the @entity93 associated with this flare travelled much faster â€“ preliminary analysis at @entity98 's @entity59 indicated it was traveling at speeds of approximately 800 miles per second			2
big bang : the longest and highest - energy light ever emitted from a solar blast was detected on march 7 by a @entity48 telescope going the distance : @entity105 's @entity105 detected high - energy gamma rays for about 20 hours , two - and - a - half times longer than any event on record the longest and highest - energy light ever emitted from a solar blast was detected earlier this year			1
@entity48 's @entity105 recorded the powerful eruption on the surface of the sun on march 7			2
the flare produced such an outpouring of gamma rays - a form of light with even greater energy than x-rays - that the sun briefly became the brightest object in the gamma - ray sky			0
the powerful march 7 flare , which earned a classification of @entity125 based on the peak intensity of its x-rays , is the strongest eruption so far observed by @entity105 's @entity105 ( @entity105 )			0
@entity130 , an astrophysicist at @entity131 in @entity132 , said : ' for most of @entity105 's four years in orbit , its @entity105 saw the sun as a faint , steady gamma - ray source thanks to the impacts of high - speed particles called cosmic rays			1
' now we 're beginning to see what the sun itself can do			0
' the sun 's activity waxes and wanes on a roughly 11 - year space weather cycle			2
this cycle began in 2008 and is expected to hit its peak in 2013 .			0

@entity150 's high level of activity causing @entity54 to be *buffeted* by solar *emissions*
outbursts over the *weekend* led to @entity156 displays across @entity23
