by @entity0 @entity1 have been offered the chance to bring @entity3 back to @entity4			2
@entity5 are prepared to sell the 23 - year - old to fund an overhaul of their squad and want around £ 30million			0
@entity3 has scored 30 goals in 54 games for @entity5 but the fallen @entity13 giants are strapped for cash and are struggling to finance even smaller deals such as @entity17 ’s £ 5m move from @entity18			2
they are keen to offer him to clubs around @entity41 with @entity42 the favourites			0
@entity34 have a buy - back option but are unlikely to take that up , yet other @entity4 clubs have been asked to consider bidding and @entity1 are among them			1
@entity24 seems likely to pursue interest in @entity18 striker @entity49 and head off interest from @entity51 , but is looking at other options too and has considered @entity54 ’s @entity53 , @entity56 ’s @entity55 and @entity57 , plus @entity58 of @entity59			0
struggles : the @entity13 giants are struggling to raise the £ 5m they need to buy @entity17 from @entity18 @entity62 : @entity1 are also interested in @entity18 and @entity64 striker @entity49 , among others			1

@entity1 have been offered the chance to buy @entity3 for £ 30million
the @entity13 giants are strapped for cash and prepared to sell their star asset
despite his *excellent* goal *record* , the club are tired of his erratic behaviour
@entity34 have a buy - back option but unlikely to use it
@entity24 also interested in @entity49 , @entity53 and @entity55
