@entity0 continued a happy pattern of results with @entity3 and @entity4 both scoring again to heap more misery on @entity7 ’s @entity6 , who have now gone 13 games without a win			1
@entity14 ’s finest and the man from @entity12 , @entity13 , have scored one apiece in three of @entity0 ’ last four @entity15 away games , going on to win 2 - 1 each time			1
as the sequence often goes , @entity3 scores , then @entity4 seals all three points — even on occasions like this when @entity0 possibly do n’t deserve it			1
it happened at @entity23 first , then @entity24 and this game unfolded accordingly with @entity3 netting the opener before @entity27 grabbed one back for the home side			1
but midfielder @entity4 popped up to secure a fourth consecutive top - flight win for @entity0			1
‘ they are playing with the confidence to run free and shoot			2
i ’m happy for the team , too			0
it was a very important three points from a difficult game			0
’ for vast swathes of the second half @entity6 dominated but lacked a final devastating touch			0
@entity7 , whose side are now six points from safety , is aware of the ominous statistic that only two sides have escaped relegation after being bottom at @entity104			0
he was @entity105 ’s assistant in 2005 when @entity106 secured @entity15 survival on the final day of the season , a feat since nicknamed the @entity110			0
‘ it ’s not @entity115 , there ’s no one answer , ’ said @entity7 this week after being asked what @entity6 needed to do to avoid relegation			0
he might first look at bolstering his strike force			0
‘ i ’m not digging my head in the sand , we ’re in trouble , ’ he said			0
‘ but performances like this would suggest we have capabilities to turn things around			0
we certainly had them defending pretty desperately at times			0
i ’m loath to play the bad - luck card , but we are close to making things happen			0
’ @entity3 primes the laces of his left boot to fire home @entity0 's @entity134 opener against @entity6 on - fire @entity0 striker @entity3 hits the shot for his 14th goal of the season in his 23rd appearance @entity6 's @entity42 attempts in vain to block the shot from @entity3 as @entity0 are quick out of the blocks @entity6 keeper @entity38 shows his frustration as @entity3 begins his celebrations @entity3 celebrates his impressive form for @entity86 's side as it continues against the team at which he spent four months of 2013 @entity0 players catch @entity3 to join in the celebrations as the @entity149 get off to a perfect start away from home @entity152 miles @entity6 117.8 73.2 @entity44 90 12.0 7.4 @entity153 90 11.8 7.4 @entity27 90 11.5 7.1 @entity0 120.5 74.8 @entity4 90 12.9 8.0 @entity66 90 12.5 7.8 @entity63 90 11.2 7.0 @entity3 did not bowl anyone over with his ability when he spent a short time at @entity6 in 2013			1
the striker spent the majority of his loan spell watching from the bench , scoring just twice in three months			0
it took only 58 seconds for him to prove to the @entity163 crowd he is much improved since then			1
now a focal point of @entity0 ’s campaign , the 21 - year - old ’s opener in the first minute was his 15th in 23 games			1
only @entity169 boasts more this season			0
@entity3 , who was heavily taunted by @entity172 fans , looked like a player riding on the wave of confidence when @entity177 ’s ball found him in the box inside one minute			1
he controlled with his right foot and slotted it past @entity38 with his left			0
but he was left holding his head in his hands just before half time when he missed a gilt - edged opportunity to as good as seal all three points for his side , wasting a free header from six yards out by somehow steering the ball wide of the post			2
his opposite number @entity27 could sympathise — the @entity192 failed to capitalise on two good chances in the first half			2
first @entity153 slotted a neat ball through but the striker wasted a delicate first touch by scuffing his effort well wide			0
then @entity44 played a pinpoint ball into the six - yard box , but @entity27 ’s diving header bounced off the inside of the post			1
@entity27 finally got the leveller in the 49th minute , after a ball into the box by @entity44			1
there was justice for @entity27 , who was being grabbed around his chest by @entity60			2
despite that , @entity27 managed to direct the ball past @entity58 at the near post			2

@entity4 popped up with the winner in the 70th minute			2
@entity3 won a free - kick on the left - hand side of the box and @entity4 ’s curling effort bounced awkwardly and sneaked past @entity38 at the near post			1
@entity44 troubled @entity0 again in the 88th minute when his superb effort saw @entity58 palm the ball into the path of @entity48 , who could n’t get his shot away			1
@entity44 and @entity48 were excellent but @entity7 is without both for six weeks when they are away for the @entity244			2
another blow for the struggling manager			0
