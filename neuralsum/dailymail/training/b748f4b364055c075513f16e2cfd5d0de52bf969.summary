by @entity0 and @entity1 aborted mission : @entity4 ' spy bosses were concerned about his state of mind at the time of his death the handlers of ‘ body in the bag ’ spy @entity4 raised concerns about his state of mind on the day he was found dead inside his flat			1
the inquest into mr @entity4 ’s death heard that a senior executive at @entity18 , the government ’s secret listening post , told police that the @entity23 spy may have reacted badly after being removed from a covert operation			1
a transcript of the call revealed that the executive added : ‘ we are not sure how he ’s taken that			0
’ the warning was passed on to officers searching for mr @entity4 , who had been missing from work for more than a week			1
he was expected at @entity23 ’s headquarters at @entity35 , @entity36 , on monday august 16 , 2010			0
but his bosses did not raise the alarm until friday and waited until after the weekend before deciding to call the police			2
mr @entity4 ’s naked body was discovered in a padlocked holdall in the bath of his flat in @entity44 , @entity45 , on the evening of august 23			1
the @entity18 warning has been seized on by mr @entity4 ’s parents as possible evidence of a cover - up about the truth of what happened to their son			1
the intelligence services have always claimed the spy ’s death had nothing to do with his secret work			1
but the warning message appears to contradict this , as it suggests they were concerned about him after they had told him to withdraw from a secret operation			0
@entity4 ’s parents , @entity67 and @entity68 , and sister @entity69 , from @entity70 , @entity71 , believe the ‘ dark arts ’ of an unnamed secret agency may have been involved in his death			1

the spy worked in a four - man team as an expert code breaker and shortly before his death had been in contact with two secret agents working in the field in the @entity86			2
concerns : transcript of phone call from @entity18 to the @entity90 about @entity4 the day his body was found on august 11 he returned to @entity36 following a six - week visit to the @entity93 , where he had been part of a contingent of @entity86 spies sent to a computer intelligence conference , known as the @entity98			1
the coroner , dr @entity99 , said on friday that the @entity101 conference attracted criminal hackers who attend the briefings to keep up with the latest developments in computer technology			0
but it is also used by security agencies from @entity86 and @entity93 to target hackers			0
the @entity110 has been reported to have sent teams of undercover agents to the conference to break up hacking cells , and also to mount clandestine operations to recruit criminal hackers as informants			0
if mr @entity4 had gone to @entity101 as part of an active intelligence operation he could have been exposed to dangers from criminal hacking gangs			1
but @entity18 insists that its officers in the @entity93 faced no greater risk than they did in the @entity86			0
his bosses also say mr @entity4 , who was due to end his secondment with @entity23 in september 2010 , had not been working on an undercover operation at the time he went missing			1
the eight - day delay in @entity18 and @entity23 telling police he was officially missing has provoked accusations from his family that they knew something ‘ horrible ’ had happened to him			0
caught on camera : @entity134 footage of mr @entity4 at a tube station on august 14 the inquest heard of a transcript of the call , made at 4.41pm on the 23rd by senior @entity18 officer @entity140 , in which she said : ‘ he was last spoken to on friday 13th			1

both the landline and mobile phones are not picked up			0
the mobile is switched off			0
his sister was expecting to stay with him on wednesday this week and she has not been able to contact him			0
’ the @entity90 operator asked if there were any concerns , to which ms @entity140 replies : ‘ he is going to be coming back to @entity78 because he ’s just been pulled back from a job he ’s supposed to do and we are not sure how he ’s taken that			2
’ police suspect another person was involved in mr @entity4 ’s death and experts believe he was likely to have been unconscious or dead when he was placed in the bag			2
forensic experts are still examining mr @entity4 ’s mobile phone after it emerged on friday that all the data on it had been wiped			2
detective constable @entity166 told the inquest that he was unable to say when the @entity168 , which was found in the living room of the flat , had been wiped before or after the spy ’s death			0
the inquest has also heard how traces of the date - rape drug ghb were found in mr @entity4 ’s body			2
forensic scientist @entity175 said the traces were ‘ probably ’ naturally occurring , which is common after death , but admitted she could not rule out that it had been taken			0
@entity23 has apologised for failing to raise the alarm about his disappearance , conceding the error may have hampered police inquiries			0
the inquest will tomorrow be told the results of an investigation into a second post-mortem examination ordered by the coroner ’s office in the days after mr @entity4 ’s death			2
the spy ’s family want to know why the police were not informed of this post-mortem examination , as they would have been in an ordinary murder inquiry			0
during the inquest , spies from @entity23 and @entity18 have given evidence behind screens to protect their identities and foreign secretary @entity200 has signed an order prohibiting the disclosure of details of mr @entity4 ’s work			1
the family ’s barrister , @entity205 , told the inquest that since @entity23 performed such an ‘ important job ’ it was even more vital that mr @entity4 ’s team leader – known as @entity209 – should have done more to raise the alarm about the spy ’s absence from work			1
it took witness g five days before he visited mr @entity4 ’s flat			2
dark arts : mr @entity4 ' family believe other secret agents were involved in his death the team leader has told the inquest he had been preparing to go into the field on a secret operation in the week the @entity226 spy went missing			1
the coroner has heard the dead spy was considered a ‘ world - class ’ intelligence officer by @entity18			0
@entity231 , mr @entity4 ’s boss in @entity78 , said the maths prodigy had won two awards for his code - breaking work			1
dr @entity99 has intimated that she is prepared to consider a verdict of unlawful killing if she believes another person was involved in the death			0
the family want the coroner to explore the possibility that mr @entity4 ’s flat may have been wiped of other people ’s dna and the spy ’s office computers tampered with			1
the electronic equipment was handed to @entity250 ’s counter-terrorism command , @entity251 , on august 27 , four days after the death came to light , the inquest heard			0
mr @entity205 noted there was not ‘ any statement from any person at @entity18 to say that equipment was not tampered with ’ in the interim period			0
