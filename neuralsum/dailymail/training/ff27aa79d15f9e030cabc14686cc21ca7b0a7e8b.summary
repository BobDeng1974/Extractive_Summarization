@entity0 will attempt to block any move by @entity3 clubs to buy @entity4 this january , but @entity5 will overrule their coach if the offer comes close to their £ 10million valuation of the player whose contract runs out at the end of the season			1
here ’s @entity14 's assessment of who should be pushing hardest for the 27 - year - old @entity17 winner : @entity4 celebrates winning the @entity17 with @entity18 in @entity19 in the summer @entity20 it ’s not difficult to see why @entity20 might try to meet that evaluation as soon as the window opens and then talk wages with the @entity26 @entity17 winner who was understood to be demanding over £ 150,000 - a - week in the summer			1
@entity4 has all the qualities @entity29 wants in the new holding midfielder he delayed buying in the summer because he believed he might end up with the @entity26 only to be outmaneuvered by @entity32 , who pounced for @entity34 and left @entity5 suddenly far more reluctant to sell @entity4			1
in @entity35 ’s @entity37 column at the weekend he touched on the great @entity29 sides having a solid centre – most famously with @entity40 and @entity41 – and @entity4 fits that mould			0
@entity20 need a solid central midfielder in the mould of @entity45 , and @entity4 would provide that he has the intelligence and the physical condition to screen the back four and he has the vision and technical ability to release players around him			2
he might also put some spark back into fellow @entity26 @entity17 winner @entity54			2
the pair were not that close at @entity5 owing to their different tastes away from football			0
@entity54 would wind down socially from big games whereas @entity4 would already be thinking about what might be asked of him in the next match			0
but the two men are friends and if @entity29 were to move @entity54 into the no 10 position he would have , with @entity63 and @entity4 , a @entity26 @entity17 winning spine to his team			1
@entity4 could leave @entity5 in january if an offer of around £ 10million comes in @entity67 just as @entity4 would have an instant friend at @entity20 in @entity54 , a move to @entity70 would reunite him with @entity71			1
they arrived at @entity5 in the same summer and the two would have plenty to talk about having both felt undervalued in the @entity77 capital			0
on the pitch @entity4 would fit into @entity80 ’s team right where it appears most vulnerable			0
the @entity83 coach turned down the chance to sign him for @entity32 in @entity18 but his options at @entity67 are considerably worse and @entity4 ’s flexibility would be a major plus			2
@entity80 and @entity67 could be in for the @entity26 midfielder come january he could hold in front of the defence or even play to the left or right of a holder and release @entity94 to play further forward			1
the quietly spoken @entity26 will not be the vocal leader @entity67 have missed in the middle of the park since @entity98 but he would be an upgrade on some of the attempts at filling his shoes in recent seasons			2
the wages that are likely to frighten @entity20 would not be a problem and the lines of communication are firmly open after the @entity94 switch this summer and @entity109 ’ move in the opposite direction			2
@entity67 even came close to landing @entity4 on the last day of the transfer window a year ago but the offer of around £ 31m arrived too late for @entity5 to properly consider it			1
it will take a lot less this time			0
@entity67 have missed a tough man in the middle of the park ever since @entity98 left @entity116 when @entity121 took over at @entity5 in may 2010 one of his first requests to his new club was that they buy @entity4			1
his impressive @entity123 match stats from the @entity17 stood up the confidence @entity121 had in him			0
only @entity125 and @entity126 ran more in that tournament and in what @entity123 call ‘ high intensity activity ’ @entity4 came out on top			0
@entity0 's decision to keep @entity4 may be overturned if the right money is offered his performances in @entity19 despite having missed almost all of the 2013 - 14 season will have done nothing to change that reputation for being a multi-purpose midfield machine			1
@entity121 has @entity141 and @entity142 combining perfectly at the moment but @entity4 would give him more tactical alternatives , the relationship between the pair is good enough for the player to wait until the end of the season saving @entity148 the transfer fee			0
and boy would n’t it annoy @entity29 ? @entity121 and @entity29 may be doing battle sooner than expected ; in the transfer market			0

@entity0 will attempt to block moves from @entity3 clubs
but if an offer of £ 10million comes in , @entity5 may overrule the @entity159
@entity20 could add @entity4 to make a @entity17 - winning spine to the team
@entity116 boss @entity121 brought @entity4 in from @entity164 when he was @entity5 boss in 2010
@entity67 could also move for the @entity26 in the january window
the 27 - year - old was thought to be asking for £ 150,000 - a - week in summer
