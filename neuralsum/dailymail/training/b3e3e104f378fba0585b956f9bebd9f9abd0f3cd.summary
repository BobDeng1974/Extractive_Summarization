by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2			0
the hilariously optimistic @entity3 , the farcically inept @entity4 ’s			1
out they tumbled of the @entity6 in disgrace when vociferous chants against the ownership of the club were far more frequent than home goals at @entity12			2
they were only heading in one direction			0
you felt for the supporters , but could n’t help but laugh : they were a joke			0
even more so when @entity3 was ‘ forced to resign ’ in september 2012 with the the club third in the @entity19			1
further still after the dismissal of @entity21 57 days into the post			0
his replacement , @entity24 , last just a week - and - a - half longer			0
he 's going nowhere ! @entity2 have no intention of selling striker @entity26 to @entity27 awareness : @entity29 ( left , with @entity30 and @entity31 ) want to keep supporters on side it was scarcely believable			1
@entity4 ’s had to change			1
they dispensed of the flamboyant yet flappable ‘ global advisor ’ @entity36 and serial caretaker @entity37 was handed the job full - time			1
that appeared to be a sign of realignment in the second tier , but @entity37 has made moves in his 15 months in charge to suggest that they are ready to kick on			1
@entity26 is the man any manager outside the top flight - and more than a few in it - wants leading his line			1
the much - maligned @entity51 is proving to be a terrific foil , too			1
@entity51 has nine goals in his last eight for @entity2 ; @entity26 is typically on more than a goal every other game			1
it is the ongoing situation of the latter that will offer a real insight into where the @entity61 side are going before the transfer window slams shut			2
@entity27 have made no secret of their desire to spend the money earned from the sale of @entity67 to @entity68 on prising away the @entity70 international			0
the offer is touching £ 12million			0
the answer is a categoric no. @entity26 only signed a new contract last month and there is absolutely no reason for @entity4 ’s to @entity77 understands that defiance is n’t borne out of negotiating a strong position for themselves in the market - this is n’t about the money , it boils down to perception			1
boiling over : @entity2 fans have made their feelings known about the owners , @entity4 's , in the past what a difference : @entity37 has steadied the ship at @entity12 since taking the job permanently rovers ’ @entity91 owners - particularly @entity93 - are very aware of their standing among the club ’s support			1
they want to keep their star striker , who scored in the win against @entity99 on saturday , to build bridges - to show they mean business			1
there has been a fair amount of relationship rebuilding going on since @entity106 was given the boot and selling @entity26 would see some good work wiped out in an instant - there is a realisation of the bond between supporters and the player			1
they do , however , have @entity116 to worry about , which represents a reasonably strong argument to part with the @entity19 ’s best front man for a quick buck			1
it is not so long ago that the club posted a pre-tax loss of £ 36.5million following relegation from the @entity6 and - in a bid to make a swift return - they overspent on the wages of @entity128 , @entity129 and the like			2
problems of the last four years have derived from ill - judged decisions stemming from poor advice taken by the owners , rather than an inherent disregard of the club			2
they are desperate to rectify that			0
all smiles : @entity26 celebrates with @entity139 after finding the net against @entity99 on saturday the monetary situation remains precarious and they could still do with profiting from the sale of players in order to balance the books for the next set of accounts			1
but allowing @entity26 to depart would be counterintuitive			1
this season is one where they can attack the top end of the division			0
@entity37 has made some shrewd signings and they have seven points from their opening four games			1
this is not a league full of quality rivals			0
there is an opportunity to win promotion with a solid foundation and a man - or men in this case - finding the net frequently			0
add @entity169 and @entity170 into the mix and they ’ve a side capable of upsetting the favourites			2
rovers recognise they also need new players			2
@entity37 is over in @entity177 at the moment and likely to fly back to @entity179 with the blessing of @entity4 ’s to go and sign a couple of new faces and utilise the loan market			1
this is n’t a @entity3 visit to @entity91			1
he has n’t been summoned , he does n’t have to go every month to provide updates			0
@entity37 commands their respect and there is a rapport ; trust is the operative word			2
and at the moment , it seems rather tranquil up in @entity2			0
they scored almost a quarter of @entity197 ’s goals this weekend			0
@entity199 ’s son @entity198 - on loan from @entity201 - get in on the act as they thrashed @entity204 4 - 1 at @entity205			0
after a miserable couple of seasons at the bottom of the @entity19 , the @entity206 are just looking forward to winning games regularly this season			2
when will it end for the @entity213 ? he has won just three games of 16 in charge of @entity217 since taking over in february			2
they were thumped 5 - 1 at @entity219 at the weekend and there is growing talk that the @entity223 could ‘ do a @entity222 ’ and suffer consecutive relegations			0
unrecognisable after players have left the club in the last three months			2
@entity227 : @entity228 @entity228 was someone who made an immediate impact on loan at @entity231 last season with three goals in six substitute appearances			0
so when the chance to snap him up permanently from @entity238 arose last week it was a no - brainer for @entity239			0
the 20 - year - old has now found the net twice in his first two fixtures for the @entity243 - against @entity244 and then @entity245 - and provides the sort of firepower @entity231 will need if they are to get out of @entity248 this season			0
poacher : @entity228 should find the net regularly after sealing a permanent move to @entity231 from @entity238			0

@entity37 's side beat @entity99 in the @entity19 on saturday
@entity4 's do *n't* want to sell @entity26 to keep fans on their side
@entity51 is proving a good foil for @entity26 up front
rovers are a different club to the mess when @entity3 was in charge
