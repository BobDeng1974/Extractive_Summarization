an airliner that was coming in to land had a near miss in mid-air with a motorised parachutist at 2,000ft about the ground			0
the @entity6 missed the flying - machine by only 150ft , causing the pilot to see the parachute canopy flash by the cockpit of the plane			1
a source told the @entity13 the pilot relayed the incident to air traffic control , saying : ' we 've just had some kind of a paraglider passing very , very close to our left - hand side			1
' the @entity21 plane saw the parachute pass across its bow the motorised parachutes can be bought as kits for around £ 1,500 and flown by people with no training an investigation has been launched to crack down on the motorised parachutes and their pilots , which can not be detected by radar systems because they travel too slowly			1
kits to build the flying machines can be purchased online for around £ 1,500 , and wannabe pilots can start taking to the skies without any training			1
air traffic controllers were unable to warn the pilot who was flying the plane from @entity41 , @entity42			1
experts said : ' he ( the pilot ) could not have taken avoiding action			2
' a recommendation to investigate the motorised parachutes was floated last july , when there had been another near miss between a plane and a glider			0
@entity52 , of the @entity53 told the @entity13 : ' most general aviation pilots will do the sensible thing and get the right training			1
' but there are some who launch into it without any thought			0
' almost colliding with a plane while you 're flying is one thing , but last year a pair of people filming on what they thought was a quiet runway had a near miss with a bi-plane			2
they were performing and filming some motorcycle stunts , when the light aircraft appeared to attempt to land , before swerving to the side			0
footage showed the plane nearly hit the bike , swerving and avoiding it , almost hitting the woman filming , and taking off again			2
flying : the man hardly has time to react as the speeding vehicle whizzes past him hold tight : after first missing the bike - rider the plane is on course to collide with the video camera operator inches : the footage reveals how close the plane comes to colliding with the unnamed woman the plane reportedly missed the woman filming by only two feet , as she utters a startled ' oh my god ... holy sh * *			1
' another near - miss saw saw a @entity94 - bound airliner carrying 232 passengers came within 200ft and seconds of a mid-air collision with a business jet over @entity98 , an official report revealed yesterday			0
the drama happened on july 27 last year after a @entity102 - owned @entity101 business jet with two crew and one passenger took off from @entity105 , initially heading west			0
the control tower told the pilot to climb to 3,000ft , but he replied that he would be going to 4,000ft			1
this so - called ' readback ' mistake was not picked up by the @entity105 controller			0
there was ' confusion between the two pilots ' as the aircraft pitched nose - down before control was recovered in the skies west of @entity120 , an @entity112 report said			1
meanwhile a @entity123 @entity122 airliner carrying 232 passengers and 16 crew , with a trainee pilot at the controls , was heading south towards the @entity128 , having been cleared to descend from 4,900ft to 4,000ft as it prepared to land at @entity94			0
it failed to follow commands from three automatic collision - avoidance warnings , which alert pilots to danger when other aircraft get too close			2
as a result , at 2.38pm the planes were flying almost head - on at a closing speed of around 700mph when they crossed paths with a difference in height of between 100ft and 200ft at 4,000ft above the @entity143 site at @entity144			2
the business jet crew saw the airliner ' in time to take effective avoiding action '			0
but the pilot of the passenger jet did not see the other plane .			0
