there may be clear daylight between @entity2 and the rest of the @entity4 , but @entity5 is n’t a happy man			1
he ’s barely raised a smile all season , with international football — and more pertinently the @entity10 — to blame			0
despite five wins from six he is irked at the amount of time it ’s taken for his stars — particularly the @entity17 trio of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 — to energise themselves after returning in july			1
the @entity21 has been forced to rotate his squad far more than he would have liked in the opening six weeks , laying the blame on the carnival in @entity17 and suggesting players need longer breaks or risk severe burnout			1
@entity18 celebrates his goal against @entity30 and was the star man for the league leaders @entity5 is less than happy despite @entity2 's flying start to the season @entity2 's convincing win against @entity30 marked @entity2 's 2000th home league game since the club 's inception in 1905 ‘ they need holidays , they do n’t have holidays , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ they need a proper pre-season , they do n’t have a proper pre- season			0
i think players are getting in trouble and when i anticipate the next pre-season it will be even worse , because there will be international matches			2
‘ for a @entity10 some teams do n’t qualify ; for the international fixtures , every player goes with his national team			0
after that , before the start of the @entity4 , they are going to have , like , two weeks of pre-season			2
’ @entity5 is particularly worried by the @entity62 in june , which means his @entity64 stars face back - to - back tournaments sandwiching the rigours of a season the @entity67 hope will last upwards of 60 games			1
@entity19 scores @entity2 's third against @entity30 - but @entity5 is worried about him joining up with @entity17 for next summer 's @entity62 @entity71 continued his flying start to the season with a stunning header against @entity30 he joked the club might have to sell their @entity77 throng — which stands at four including @entity78 — because of the competition			1
@entity80 warmed up for the @entity82 match with @entity2 in @entity83 with a 1 - 1 draw with bitter rivals @entity85			2
@entity86 put them ahead before a @entity89 own goal condemned them to a fourth 1 - 1 draw this season credit must be thrown in @entity5 ’s direction though			0
while he does have a squad stacked with quality , the way in which he has tinkered with it has been astute			0
@entity18 — the standout of saturday ’s win against @entity30 — has been a chief beneficiary			1
dropped against @entity102 and @entity103 , he came back against @entity104 in the @entity105			0
two goals later those decisions look shrewd , particularly after this sparkling display in which he opened the scoring			0
‘ i have had time , ’ @entity18 said			2
‘ @entity5 told me he has a lot of players , so i do n’t play against @entity103 , or @entity102 at the start			0
but i start against @entity104 and i play well because i am not tired			0
’ @entity2 enter their second truly testing week of the season at @entity80 tomorrow before facing @entity117 on sunday , with the club unsure whether @entity71 will be fit enough to carry on			1
@entity5 said the @entity121 forward is ‘ doing nothing ’ in training as medical staff nurse him through games			0
@entity20 is another of @entity2 's growing @entity17 contingent with the signing of @entity127 making it four @entity129 stars			1

@entity2 have won five out of six in the @entity4 so far
goals from @entity18 , @entity71 and @entity19 secure 3 - 0 win over @entity30
but *concerned* about his @entity17 players @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity127 playing in the @entity62 in june
claims star *striker* @entity71 is doing ' *practically* nothing ' in training as he nurses an *ongoing* *hamstring* problem
