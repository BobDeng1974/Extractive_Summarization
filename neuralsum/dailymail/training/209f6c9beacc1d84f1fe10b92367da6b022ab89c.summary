there 's been a dramatic twist in the shocking axe murders last month of members of the @entity5 family in @entity6 , with allegations that the surviving son ’s injuries were self - inflicted , and in a further development authorities also believe he waited about four hours to call for help			1
the @entity12 has reported that @entity13 , 20 , who was treated for only minor injuries , and called emergency services at 7.30am claiming his family was ' attacked by a guy with an axe ' despite the investigators finding the brutal attack took place at 3am in the city of @entity23			1
the brutal assault left his teenage sister @entity25 , 16 , bleeding and close to death on the balcony of her family 's home in @entity23 , after her throat was cut and she 'd suffered horrific head injuries			1
ms @entity33 's mother @entity32 , 54 , was found dead on the balcony and police discovered her deceased father @entity36 , 55 , and brother @entity37 , 22 , in a bedroom			1
@entity33 has recovered the ability to blink in response to questions which police had hoped could be vital to finding the killer			1
@entity25 , 16 ( front left ) , suffered severe head and throat injuries chilling : an audio recording between @entity13 ( right , pictured with brother @entity37 ) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe , revealed the 20 - year - old appeared to giggle during the call survivor : the attackers left @entity25 ( pictured ) with a cut throat and ' severe ' head injuries on the balcony of her home in @entity23 - 50 kilometres east of @entity65			1
she has begun reacting to questions from investigators , however , by blinking since then , police have revealed that it was at least four hours before her brother @entity13 reported the crime inside the high - security golf estate , about 50 kilometres east of @entity65			1
remarkably , an audio recording of the five - minute phone call , obtained by @entity74 , seems to reveal @entity13 ' giggling ' as he explains the details of the bloody attack			1
' what kind of injuries are there ? ' a woman can be heard asking @entity13 , who responds : ' my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe			1
' when asked if they were unconscious , he responded , ' yes , and bleeding from the head ' , before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard			1
a cleaner who worked for one of the @entity95 ' neighbours saw the young man , covered in blood , using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack			2
it 's also thought that a doctor who examined @entity13 after the murders , suggests the bruises and scratches on his arms were ' self - inflicted '			1
investigators have also confirmed that a ' brand new axe ' was the weapon used			2
in the meantime , everything appears to hinge on the future testimony of young @entity25			1
according to her uncle , @entity115 , “ she is getting better every day , she is moving her eyes to follow instructions			0
” the young man 's mental health has been under speculation since @entity120 reported he had undergone brain scans at an @entity123 hospital in 2014			1
however the results were revealed to have been negative and no further testing occurred			2
the @entity126 reported his uncle her @entity33 , who has been caring for the 20 - year - old , said his nephew is heart - broken			1
he denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply hidden from the media 's gaze			1
deceased : @entity36 ( left ) and wife @entity140 ( right ) both died at their home in @entity23 - about 50 kilometres , east of @entity65 brothers : @entity37 ( pictured left and right ) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman			1
his younger brother @entity13 is now being investigated over his self - inflicted injuries and the four - hour delay in calling for help from emergency services mr @entity13 added : ' for obvious reasons @entity13 is very heartbroken , and we will support him as the family			1
' we as a family are here for him , we will not disappoint him ... i promise @entity13 i wo n't drop him			1
' @entity25 remains in a stable but serious condition in hospital - but both family and friends have been barred from her bedside			1
she underwent brain surgery after the attack and is being closely monitored by doctors , while police provide round - the - clock guard			1
