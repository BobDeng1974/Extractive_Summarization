by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 13:11 est , 13 june 2012 parts of @entity2 and @entity3 faced the risk of flooding once again today after warnings of more heavy rain			1
the @entity8 urged people in @entity10 , @entity11 , west @entity12 , @entity13 and parts of the @entity15 to remain prepared for the possibility of floods as the @entity18 issued a weather warning for heavy rain			1
intense thundery downpours are expected this afternoon , which could lead to flash flooding in some areas			1
@entity10 and @entity11 are at an increased risk of floods , and caravan and camping site operators across the @entity27 should be ready to take action if flooding occurs , the @entity8 said			1
making the most of it : a boy plays in a dingy along a flooded road in @entity35 near @entity36 in @entity37 near the area where the villagers had to be evacuated the @entity8 currently has five flood warnings ( meaning that flooding is expected ) for rivers in place			1
there are also 21 flood alerts for rivers across @entity2 and @entity3 , meaning that flooding is possible			1
today the agency has sent equipment to pump out floodwaters in @entity50 near @entity51 where a collapsed culvert led to a build up of water on the @entity55 , and in @entity35 and @entity36 where residents had to be evacuated after heavy rainfall flooded their homes earlier this week			2
@entity60 , @entity61 and council officers also said they were working together to evacuate people from flooded homes in the village of @entity66 , near @entity36 , after reports of flooding of up to 6ft in some homes			2
they used inflatable boats to reach 250 vulnerable homes , knocking on doors and searching properties to make sure people were safe and received the help they needed , a @entity60 spokeswoman said			2
be aware : the map on the left shows the rain concentrated in the @entity79 this week while the map on the right shows where there is warnings of heavy rain lapping waters : @entity86 , in @entity35 , @entity36 , was underwater today as were any unfortunate cars left parked on it residents were taken to @entity91 in @entity35 , @entity37 , and 10 people are being looked after and offered the support of designated housing officers to help find accommodation and liaise with insurance companies , she added			1
chief superintendent @entity97 said : ' i can assure residents that working with partner agencies we are doing all we can to care for those affected by the floods			0
' we are constantly reviewing the situation with partners and have created a multi- agency adverse weather office to coordinate our response			2
' @entity108 , deputy chief executive of @entity109 , said : ' as a district council our role is to support the emergency services in their response to this incident and working with others our priority is always to help people who have been evacuated from their homes , ensuring they have somewhere safe and dry to stay and helping with housing advice			2
' three rest centres have been set up across the district in the last 24 hours in response to the exceptional weather conditions			2
further unsettled weather is predicted for the rest of the week , and the @entity8 is keeping a close watch on river levels , after heavy rain has left many areas more vulnerable to flooding			1
@entity8 teams have been working round the clock , with other emergency responders , checking flood defences , clearing blockages , monitoring river levels and issuing flood warnings			1
the @entity8 urged the public to remain vigilant and check its website and @entity140 feed for the latest situation			1
it also advised the public to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through floodwater			0
a spokesperson for the @entity18 said : ' a good portion of the @entity146 will be sunny dry and sunny today , but there will also be some heavy showers across certain regions			1
' meanwhile three of the @entity146 ’s biggest water companies are lifting hosepipe bans , imposed to deal with drought , following weeks of heavy rain , from midnight tonight			1
@entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 are to end restrictions because of the ‘ exceptional ’ rainfall over the last three days , on top of april ’s record levels			0
seven water companies across southern and eastern @entity2 brought in hosepipe bans after two unusually dry winters left some groundwater supplies and rivers as low as in the drought year of 1976			2
but the restrictions were followed by record rainfall across the @entity146 in april and more rain in may and the beginning of june , leading to flooding in some areas			1
@entity172 , sustainability director for @entity155 , said : ' while we prepared for worst , bringing in restrictions to save water to ensure there would be enough if the dry spell continued , the topsy - turvy @entity146 weather had other ideas			1
water cycling : a man makes his way along the flooded road in @entity35 , @entity36 today after the @entity184 and mid @entity3 were worst hit by the rain which has battered @entity146 water world : much of the @entity187 on @entity188 , @entity36 lies underwater today after the region was hit with nearly a month and a half 's worth of rain in 36 hours ' we are really pleased we can now lift the ban but , with groundwater levels still low and the possibility of a third successive dry winter , we still need to be careful			1
we do n’t need a ban , but we do need to ask everyone to keep on using water wisely			0
' @entity156 ’s water quality and strategy manager @entity202 said : ' while our focus remains firmly on dealing with the aftermath of the torrential rain and flooding in the south over the last few days , it is also right for us to lift the water restrictions			2
' in its latest drought briefing last week , the @entity8 said the wet weather had significantly reduced the risk of drought and widespread water restrictions this summer			1
river levels and reservoir stocks have improved significantly and further water restrictions for the public and businesses are unlikely , the government agency said			0
but groundwater levels are still well below normal in some areas , with some as low as in the drought year of 1976 , and are unlikely to improve before the winter			0
companies which rely primarily on underground aquifers for supplies are maintaining their hosepipe bans			0
@entity228 , water resources manager of @entity230 , said : ' months of wet weather , particularly during the next autumn and winter period , will be needed to restore groundwater to normal levels			0
' the current temporary use ban , which includes hosepipe usage , has been assisting to reduce demand and conserve our water resources and we would like to thank our customers for their incredible support			0
' unfortunately , at present we will not be relaxing the temporary use ban further , as we need to conserve our supply of water to prepare for the possibility of a third dry autumn and winter			0
' meanwhile @entity146 's washout summer has caused a slimy new problem for farmers - an invasion of millions of crop munching slugs			1
the wet spring and summer has produced ideal breeding conditions for the creatures now hungrily devouring crops after multiplying @entity256 @entity255 of @entity258 organics , near @entity259 , @entity10 , has been particularly badly hit			2
the carrots and aubergines he grows organically have been decimated by the pests which get under the edges of his polythene greenhouses			0
and because he does n’t use pesticides it means he is faced with a horror job of killing as many slugs as possible - by hand			2
he said : ' the crops have taken a hammering			0
' the slugs eat the growing tips out of the middle of the plant which really knocks the plant back			0
' we have to come in the middle of the night and pick them off the plants			0
' then you have to either drown them or crush them - it ’s not the nicest of jobs			0
unhappy : farmer @entity255 from @entity258 organics , near @entity259 , @entity10 , whose produce has been hit by an invasion of millions of crop munching slugs problematic weather : the wet spring and summer has produced ideal breeding conditions for the creatures now hungrily devouring crops after multiplying rapidly ' you have to wear gloves because you ’ll never get the slime off your fingers otherwise			1
' a spokesman for the @entity305 said the slug infestation was disastrous			0
he said : ' on a good night a slug can munch its way through 50 wheat seeds after they ’ve been planted			0
' they can travel over five metres a night , they can smell food over 60 centimetres away and then they ’re all over it			0
' they ’re not good news			0
