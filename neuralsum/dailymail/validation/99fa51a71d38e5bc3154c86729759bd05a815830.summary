the whole question was to work out how to display them			0
' for many years i 've worked on the windows of our boutiques , and i love doing it			0
but doing an exhibition in a museum is a different kind of undertaking , because it involves a different vocabulary			0
' @entity175 having done an exhibition , i wanted to learn all i could from @entity177 and his team			0
we had two options : either to be historical and do a very academic retrospective with a succession of dates ; or to follow our feelings , to love and admire the clothes , touch the visitors ’ heart through the sheer beauty of these garments , and finish the exhibition kind of up on a cloud			0
' i think we have managed to create an exhibition around the dream of fashion			2
what i am hoping for is to hear the visitors say " i love @entity7 "			2

@entity7 , who died in 1946 , will be honoured in a new exhibition
