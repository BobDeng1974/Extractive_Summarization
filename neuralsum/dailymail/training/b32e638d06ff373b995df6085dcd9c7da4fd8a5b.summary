by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 03:12 est , 6 december 2012 crematorium staff put the remains of babies in cardboard boxes and secretly buried them in an unmarked grave for 45 years , it emerged today			2
officials at the council - run @entity8 in @entity10 have admitted stillborn infants or babies who died days after being born were unceremoniously disposed of in this way since 1967			1
@entity14 is now investigating the practice , which went unchecked for almost 45 years until new management took over the site last year			1
@entity18 , the mother of one baby cremated at @entity8 , was told by the new manager that ' laziness or a bad attitude ' was likely to blame			1
grieving mother : @entity18 , pictured at @entity24 , where her baby @entity26 's ashes are buried grieving parents who took their babies to the site were told after the cremation that there was nothing left to scatter			1
but the remains were actually being placed in boxes and interred in an unmarked pit in a garden of remembrance behind the crematorium			2
it is not known how many babies were buried in this way			0
the council said it is now looking into installing a memorial in the garden of remembrance as a ' mark of respect '			0
the discovery was made by @entity46 , a charity which counsel parents who have lost a child through stillbirth or neonatal death			1
@entity14 has launched an investigation and environmental services convener , councillor @entity54 , has offered a full apology			1
@entity56 , 43 , works at the charity and her son @entity57 died in 2004 when he was just one day old			2
she was told she could not have her son ’s ashes and later discovered @entity57 ’s remains were dumped in a mass grave in a biodegradable box			1
@entity56 , from @entity10 , said : ' on the day of my son ’s cremation i went to get his ashes and was told there was n’t any			1
' now i know there were ashes and they lied to me			2
that was over eight years ago			0
it opens up the raw emotions again and is very upsetting			0
' i want to know why they felt they had to do this			0
somebody needs to be held accountable			0
' lied to : @entity56 , whose son @entity77 died at one day old in 2004 , was told there were no ashes to scatter unmarked graves : it is not known how many babies were buried in a mass unmarked grave at @entity85 's garden of remembrance officials at @entity88 made the discovery while writing a book about parents whose babies are stillborn or die shortly after being born			1
during research they found only some parents were given ashes and discovered the practice in place at the crematorium			2
@entity18 , the charity ’s operations manager , discovered the ashes of daughter @entity26 had been interred in the ground at @entity8			1
apology : councillor @entity54 said the council will look into a memorial for the garden but 26 years earlier she was told there would be nothing for her to collect after the funeral			1
@entity18 , 56 , said : ' it ’s come as a complete shock to me			0
for years i have had nowhere to go to put flowers , or grieve for @entity26			0
' the new manager at the crematorium has told me the only reason he can think why this happened in the past was either laziness or a bad attitude			1
' we need to know how many babies ’ ashes are buried there			2
my fear is that some kind of moral judgement was made and it was only babies who survived for a few days before dying who were buried , so who knows what happened to the ashes of those stillborn ? ' it is feared the number of babies buried in this way could run into the hundreds			0
the practice is understood to have been accepted policy at the crematorium from its opening in 1967 until last year following the arrival of a new manager			0
it is not known whether the policy was devised by one official acting alone or approved by more senior managers at the local authority			0
@entity152 ’s new manager has changed the policy so all parents who wish to receive the ashes of their babies now receive them			1
councillor @entity54 said there was no indication of whether legal action was likely but it is doing ' everything possible ' to find an explanation			0
she said : ' we will be truthful about what ’s happened and we will look into a memorial for the garden			0
' we will also be making doubly sure people are now happy with the policy we have in operation and that they are getting the right information and choices			0

process at @entity8 in @entity10 *uncovered* by parent charity @entity46
grieving parents who went to collect their baby 's ashes were told there were no remains left to scatter
@entity14 launches investigation and councillor apologises
new manager tells bereaved mother ' laziness or bad attitude ' was to blame
