@entity1 ( @entity9 ) attacked at the start of the last of 13 laps of the 89 - kilometre race , but was edged into the safety barrier inside the final kilometre by @entity15 , one of @entity17 ' team - mates			1
an aggressive race which featured numerous attempts to avoid a bunch sprint finished with the pack tearing down the @entity8 and @entity17 ( @entity22 ) dug deep to hold off fellow @entity24 @entity23 ( @entity25 )			2
@entity1 ( @entity9 ) , the @entity7 silver medallist behind @entity17 on @entity27 two summers ago , picked herself up to finish more than three minutes behind , in 94th place , nursing a bloody elbow and battered pride			1
@entity1 crashed in @entity4 as @entity6 won the race @entity33 of class : olympic champion @entity6 celebrates after winning the @entity2 race in @entity4 the 25 - year - old from @entity38 , who required stitches but will be fine for next sunday 's @entity42 road race in @entity43 , said : ' i had a bit of bad luck in the race			1
i dropped my chain two times so i had to change the bike two times			0
' and then in the final i was a little bit out of position but i was pretty okay because i was on @entity17 ' wheel so i was n't too panicked			2
' but her team - mate just put me in the barrier , @entity15			0
she turned right on me and took her team - mate down as well ( the @entity60 champion @entity59 )			0
' the race took place on the final day of the @entity63 , which began in @entity64 on july 5 , and was an opportunity for women 's cycling to showcase itself on cycling 's most famous road finishing circuit			1
' i wanted to put on a show and maybe it was a bit silly but i 'm not an out and out sprinter , " @entity1 said of her foiled attack			0
' today it was really special for me because obviously the @entity3 started in @entity78 and i heard lots of chants of ' @entity78 ' as i was riding around today			0
@entity6 crosses the line to win the @entity2 in @entity4 ' just to be riding around @entity4 is not something i ever expected to experience			1
' it just made me proud of where women 's cycling is at the moment			2
' @entity88 was proud , too , as one of four women - alongside @entity17 , @entity92 @entity91 and former triathlete @entity93 , all part of @entity96 campaign group - who petitioned @entity63 organisers @entity97 to put on a women 's race			1
' it was an amazing experience , ' said @entity88 ( @entity100 ) , who was 84th in a race which did not suit her climbing ability			0

@entity88 hopes for further opportunities for women 's cycling now			1
she said : ' i 'd love to see more long women 's stage races alongside the men 's races , but at the moment it will take time to develop			1
@entity33 rider @entity6 celebrates victory in the first ever @entity2 ' that 's not up to me			2
@entity97 do n't have some kind of duty to put on women 's races , they 're a money - making organisation			2
' if it 's a success because of the audience and their response is because of the audience , then it will expand because it 's a good financial proposition			0
' it 's a huge missed opportunity at the moment , financially			0
think of the number of women who ride bikes nowadays			0
' @entity88 will now ride thursday 's time - trial at the @entity42 for @entity138 , a race from which @entity1 had already withdrawn to focus on sunday 's road race over the circuit on which she won the 2013 @entity143 title			1
