the new tablet is labelled as ' @entity23 ' - but the connection wo n't work in many countries including the @entity2 ' all @entity2 ads should avoid containing anything that is likely to mislead , ' says a spokesperson			1
' @entity29 states that ads must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information or by presenting it in an unclear , unintelligible or ambiguous way			2
' without going through due process we ca n't say whether the ad is likely to be problematic			2
