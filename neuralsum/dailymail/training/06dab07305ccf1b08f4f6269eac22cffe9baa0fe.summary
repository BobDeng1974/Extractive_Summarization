with the october half - term approaching , a new study from @entity1 has found that @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 are the top @entity6 destinations to visit			1
but before you jet off , take heed : one in three @entity9 will offend the locals while on holiday			0
@entity1 has found that failing to speak the local language is the top indiscretion committed abroad , with one in ten admitting to it			1
interestingly , the reason most brits do n't attempt to speak the language abroad has very little to do with disrespect			1
over two thirds of those surveyed said they feel embarrassed or annoyed when they ca n't make themselves understood - so they do n't even try - with the most likely to speak @entity22 being those from the @entity31 and @entity32			2
and while it may seem offensive to imitate the local dialect , 63 per cent admit to speaking slowly or raising their voice in an attempt to make themselves understood , while one in 12 even resort to drawing pictures to get their point across			2
it 's worth noting however that this tendency is more likely to be seen in men			0
only one in six women will exaggerate their words or attempt a local accent in effort to be understood			0
still , many travellers do take the time to teach themselves foreign phrases and key words - and it seems that manners matter most			1
seventy seven per cent of those surveyed rank ' thank you ' at the top of their list of phrases to learn , closely followed by ' please			0
' in @entity3 , a common tourist faux pas is offering to split the bill in a restaurant it 's not all bad ! most tourists will attempt to learn some key phrases in the local language ( pictured : @entity68 ) ' can i have a beer please ? ' is deemed the most important travel phrase by one third of all men , but it seems to be more common among younger holidaymakers			1
nevertheless , it 's also important for tourists abroad to take note of a faux pas that can be made inadvertently - offering to split the bill in @entity3 , for example , is a common mistake			0
@entity82 , @entity83 , said : ' whilst our report shows an encouraging two in five people do make the effort to learn some local lingo so as not to offend , it also reveals that a third of us have committed a faux pas when on holiday in a foreign country			0
' although no one can expect to be word - perfect in a foreign language before they jet off abroad , reading up on a few of the cultural traditions and key phrases ahead of time can make the world of difference and avoid any unnecessary embarrassment			2

study found one in ten @entity107 will not attempt local language abroad

still , many travellers do take the time to learn key words and phrases
