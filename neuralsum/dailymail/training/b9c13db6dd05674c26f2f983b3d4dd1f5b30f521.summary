by @entity0 a plague of intelligent super-rats has invaded @entity4 town centre and have learned to avoid traps while foraging for food			1
the latest super-rats , photographed by pest control expert @entity8 , avoided getting snared on the deadly trap despite nibbling on the food			1
mr @entity8 was staking out a lane way in @entity4 when he spotted the first of the monster rats			1
one of the monster super-rats investigates an abandoned box of chicken bones from a local takeaway the cunning rat has learned not to put his front paws on the trap 's pressure plate , allowing him to feast on tinned fish without having his neck snapped by the spring - loaded device @entity26 will do nicely : the rodent manages to defeat the trap by safely removing the food without suffering any injury he said : ' i was looking to take some photographs for my new pest control business and set up on @entity35 in @entity4			1
' it is just behind the main shopping centre and is in the middle of town			1
i put out a trap baited with some of @entity42 's finest sardines in @entity43 and sat back			1
' i was about 18 metres away using a 400mm lens when this massive rat appeared			2
he was so big i could n't get him all in frame - even from that distance			0
' according to mr @entity8 , he was preparing for a fairly long stakeout to get the perfect shot , but because @entity4 's rat problem is so severe , he was spoiled for choice			1
' rats have an excellent sense of smell and that 's why i baited my trap with fish			2
i was taking photos and the flash on the camera was going off , but they had no fear			0
rats used to be afraid of new things but not any longer			0
' when they approached the trap , i 'm certain that they knew exactly what it was			0
they were very careful not to put their front paws on the trap as this would release the spring			0
not only do we know have super-rats , but we have intelligent super rats			2
' there are an estimated 10 million rats in the @entity80 and the population has exploded over the past several months because of the mild winter			2
according to mr @entity8 , overflowing bins are an excellent source of food for rats allowing them to thrive the exceptionally mild winter and a plentiful supply of food is responsible for the explosion in super-rat numbers mr @entity8 said exterminators need to be brought into areas that are invested by colonies of super-rats according to mr @entity8 , conditions are perfect for breeding rats			1
' i do n't think i can blame @entity4 council for the rat problem			1
the budget for street cleansing might be under pressure , but the council did n't dump fast food wrappers all over the place			0
' we have everything we need to sustain a massive rat population			2
all they need is food and water			0
there is plenty of food dumped on the street on a nightly basis and the bins are overflowing			0
' everyone who dumps food on the street is responsible for this super-rat problem			2
we need to all work together to face this problem			0
not dumping food is a good start but we also need to target rat populations with poison			0
that is the only way to keep them under control			0
' mr @entity8 said that modern rats are far less afraid of humans and have the ability to learn a super-rat at least 18 inches long scurries past the loaded trap towards a chicken dinner a pair of smaller rats manage to avoid getting killed by the trap while taking the bait on @entity35 in @entity140 meanwhile , several parts of the country have been plagued by infestations of super-rats			1
last week , a 2ft long rat was captured in @entity146 while other monster rats have been reported in @entity148 and in @entity149			1
it is feared that some of these larger rats are becoming increasingly resistant to poison and are far more difficult to kill			0
one listener to the @entity156 show on @entity157 tweeted a picture of a giant rat he had found meanwhile , in @entity146 , one @entity161 user posted a photograph of a rat which was larger than a cat another giant rodent was discovered in @entity166 , @entity148 near a river and collected on a pink shovel			1
