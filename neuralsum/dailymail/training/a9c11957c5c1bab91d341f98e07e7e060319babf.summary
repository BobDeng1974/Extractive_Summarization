the university offered to evacuate children of @entity13 staff in 1940 , but it appears there could have been a sinister motive behind their seemingly kind offer			2
there are now concerns that leaders of the eugenics movement at @entity5 may have extended the invitation because they planned to repopulate a devastated @entity8 with a race of intellectually superior children			2
hidden motive : accusations have emerged that when a @entity28 university offered refuge to 125 children of @entity13 staff during @entity9 , there was a sinister motive ( file pic ) ' was @entity5 hoping to save the offspring of the @entity8 academic elite , protecting those 125 children because it saw them as future leadership class , especially deserving of preservation ? ' asks @entity39 in @entity40			1
as the threat of invasion loomed and the terror of @entity45 bombs continued , @entity5 sent a letter to both @entity48 and @entity49 universities , offering children of their fellows and dons evacuation refuge in the @entity28 calling itself the @entity57 and @entity58 , 125 @entity48 children and 35 mothers took up the offer , boarding the @entity60 from @entity61 to @entity62 , @entity63 on 8 july 1940			1
@entity13 : @entity5 sent a letter to both @entity48 and @entity49 universities , offering children of their fellows and dons evacuation refuge in the @entity28 @entity5 : but @entity39 asks ' was @entity5 hoping to save the offspring of the @entity8 academic elite , protecting those 125 children because it saw them as future leadership class , especially deserving of preservation ? ' the children missed their parents , but enjoyed the new world they have found themselves immersed in			1
they found the @entity28 classrooms less rigid than @entity77 schooling and reveled in new experiences during their five year stay			0
@entity80 who was evacuated with her younger brother , describes the trip as ' the camaraderie between educated people ' ' that connected two prestigious universities , ' reported @entity40			0
but @entity86 , who was also evacuated , and thoroughly enjoyed her time at @entity5 , has raised questions about the experience asking did they want ' to save the gene pool ? ' @entity5 only offered refuge to @entity48 and @entity49 , but @entity49 rejected the offer , concerned that ' this might be interpreted as a privilege for a special class , ' reported @entity40			1
evacuee @entity86 discovered that the man who had taken in her family , @entity97 , was not only the professor of geography at @entity5 - he was also the former president of the @entity99 dr @entity100 of @entity101 was a driving force behind the rescue and said the committee ' hoped to save some of the children of intellectuals before the storm breaks			2

@entity119 's son @entity118 , saw the human race as no different to animals and similarly , ' weak ' humans should not be encourage to breed			0
