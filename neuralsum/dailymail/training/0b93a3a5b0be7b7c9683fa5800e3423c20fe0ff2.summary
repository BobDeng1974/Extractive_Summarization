surveillance video from the @entity10 shows the teen in a grey hoodie and long khaki trousers , first looking through the aisles and then paying for his bag of @entity16 and @entity17 iced tea			1
the chilling video was taken before @entity3 returned to the gated community in which @entity3 ’s father lives and was gunned down by @entity22			1
among the massive amounts of evidence are nearly 200 pages of documents , including photos and eyewitness accounts , that show @entity22 and @entity3 were in a loud and blood fight in the moments leading up to the shooting , and that @entity22 appeared to be getting the worst of it , with wounds to both his face and the back of his head			1
according to statements made by @entity3 ’s girlfriend , who was on the phone with the teen the night of february 26 , his last words were : ‘ get off , get off			1
’ his cell phone then cut off and @entity3 was shot , his girlfriend said in the interview with a prosecutor			1
