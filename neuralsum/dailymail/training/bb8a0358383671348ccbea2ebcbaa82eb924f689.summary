a woman sentenced to a @entity2 labour camp has revealed she was forced to clean out filthy toilets with her bare hands as people ate rats in a desperate attempt to survive			1
@entity8 spent a year inside one of the country 's notorious detention camps after being deported from @entity12 where she had fled to escape starving to death			1
now , she has revealed the truth about life inside the secretive state and said : ' really it was unspeakably bad			2
you could say the whole of @entity2 is one big prison			1
' the people are all hungry			2
and now , there are n't even rats , snakes or wild plants left for them to eat			1
the train station platforms were full of dead bodies ' @entity44 has now spoken out about her ordeal to @entity46 in a short film called ' @entity48 '			2
the name refers to the recent controversial @entity51 comedy ' @entity50 ' , where two tv producers are recruited by the @entity53 in an attempt to assassinate current @entity2 leader @entity55			1
outraged @entity2 authorities initially called for the film to be banned and said releasing it would be ' act of war '			1
in december , @entity51 's email database was then hacked and several thousand embarrassing emails were released			2
@entity8 first left @entity2 during the the famine that ravaged the country in the late 1990s			1
estimates on the number of people who died have been as high as four million			2
she said : ' a lot of people died between 1996 and 1998			2
the train station platforms were full of dead bodies			2
' the country was then being run by @entity71 , the totalitarian ruler whose son @entity55 is now in power			2
heartbroken , @entity8 had to leave her dying father behind as she paid to be trafficked into @entity12 along with her sister to escape the famine			1
but authorities soon discovered her origins and sent her back to @entity2 , where she was sentenced to hard labour as punishment for her attempt to escape			1
as she was arrested in @entity12 , @entity8 was classified as an ' economic defector ' and sent to the brutal @entity30 labour camp in the @entity86 district			1
revealing the truth about life inside the camp , where prisoners are forced to call the guards ' teachers ' , she said : ' we were worked harder than animals			1
' our working day began at 4.30am , before we could have anything to eat			2
in the summer when the days are longer , we would work until 8pm or 9pm in the evening			0
' we would only stop working when it got pitch dark			0
and the day does n't end there			0
' after eating we had to reflect on our day 's performance , recite the @entity101 's principles and learn songs			0
by that time , it 'd be close to midnight			0
' tears : an emotional @entity8 broke down as she spoke about her past life and said : ' really it was unspeakably bad			1
you could say the whole of @entity2 is one big labour camp ' cramped : women were herded into the labour camps in their hundreds and ordered around by guards they were forced to call ' teachers ' @entity8 also recounts being sent to the mountains in the @entity117 district of the country , where the prisoners were forced to clear the mountainside to create terraced fields			1
starving women would eat raw potatoes straight from the ground with dirt still on them as they were so desperate for food			1
prisoners would also pick seeds out of animal dung to eat , and feast on food left out for dogs and cows as they desperately struggled to survive			2
@entity8 said : ' we cleared the land with our bare hands			1
four women had to pull an oxcart , two in the front and two in the back , carrying a ton of soil in the cart			0
' we would n't do this at a walking pace either			0
' in another horrific memory , she recalls : ' if you got caught trying to wash your sanitary towel , you were ordered to wear it on your head , dripping blood and all , and beg for forgiveness			0
' starving : working long hours on the mountainside to create terraced fields , the starving women would eat rats and raw potatoes in their fight for survival anyone caught trying to to defect to @entity163 were sent to political prison camps and never seen again			1
in an interview with @entity46 , @entity8 says that after her family were displaced during the famine , she stayed to look after her elderly father			1
a heartbroken @entity8 remembers : ' as my father 's condition grew worse , he was n't able to speak anymore			1
he could only gesture with his hands , telling me to go , to leave @entity2			1
' my father kept gesturing to me to go			0
i could n't be there for him when he passed away			0
i left him there in that cold room			0
i left him a bowl of rice and a change of clothes			0
i left @entity2 like that			1
' wiping away tears , she adds : ' i was n't by my father 's side when he passed away			0
like a selfish child , i left just to save my own skin			0
' but just two weeks after being trafficked into @entity12 there , she was told she must marry a man to ensure her family 's wellbeing			0
traffickers were prepared to sell her on and share the money with her family			0
when @entity8 refused , she was threatened with deportation , which forced her to then agree to marry the stranger			1
survivor : today , @entity8 lives in @entity200 with her partner and four children , where she is rebuilding her life after suffering in the labour camps dynasty : @entity71 ( left ) was the leader of @entity2 when @entity8 was imprisoned			1
his son @entity55 ( right ) is the current leader of the country she was then put in a safe house , where prospective buyers would come to look at her			0
@entity8 said : ' they would come and haggle over my price			1
it was no different from an animal being sold in the marketplace			0
' she was then sold for 5,000 yuan – approximately £ 500			0
she said : ' when you get sold off , the person who bought you will say , " i 've paid for you so now you must do whatever i tell you			0
if you disobey in the slightest , i could report you			0
even if i kill you , no - one 's going to say anything , and no - one will know what happened to you " '			0
' that 's how they intimidate and threaten @entity2 into forced marriages			1
' famine struck @entity2 in the 1990s due to a combination of economic mismanagement , failing crops and a series of flood and droughts			1
experts have claimed as many as four million people may have died - but it has been impossible to provide a definitive total due to the secret nature of the totalitarian state			2
the country requested humanitarian aid in 1995 to try to prevent further deaths , but the problems persisted until around 1999			0
one of the long - lasting effects has been severe malnutrition in the nation 's young people			2
it has been estimated that approximately 45 per cent of under - fives in the country today suffer from stunted growth due to malnutrition			0
@entity8 then fell pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy , alone and in a guarded hut			1
she named her son @entity254 – which means ' iron ' – because she wanted him to have a strong character			0
but her time in @entity12 was cut short when she was deported by the authorities			0
she was separated from her son and husband at the police station , and did not get the chance to say goodbye to them			0
after contracting tetanus in her leg , @entity8 was left unable to work or even walk			1
now considered useless to the regime , the authorities discharged her from the labour camp			1
frightened and alone , she returned to @entity12 were she was eventually reunited with her son			0
terrified of being deported back to @entity2 , @entity8 then arranged for them to travel to @entity272			1
they arrived at the border by foot and clambered through two wire fences , taking extra care not to alert the border guards who were on patrol			0
but @entity8 and her son were unable to make it through the fences , and panicked as @entity12 police cars pulled up to investigate			1
luckily , a mystery man then appeared and cut through the wire fences , allowing the two to finally enter @entity272			0
@entity8 then fell in love with the man who saved her life and the couple are now live in @entity200 with their three children and her son			1
they plan to get married in the near future			0
sold : when she arrived in @entity12 , @entity8 was sold off by the traffickers who had got her into the country			2
she was eventually bought for approximately £ 500 torn apart : when the @entity12 authorities arrested and deported her , @entity8 was taken away without getting to say goodbye to her son			2
years later , the pair would be emotionally reunited @entity298 , @entity299 , said : ' this is the other film @entity2 really does n't want you to see , and with good reason			2
' people in @entity2 are subjected to an existence beyond nightmares			1
the population is ruled by fear with a network of prison camps a constant spectre for those who dare step out of line			2
' thousands of people in the camps are worked to death , starved to death , beaten to death			2
some are sent there just for knowing someone who has fallen out of favour			0
' @entity46 is releasing " @entity48 " so that people all over the world can hear first - hand how people in @entity2 are suffering appallingly at the hands of @entity55 and his officials			1
' they do n't want you to see it , which is precisely why you should			0
