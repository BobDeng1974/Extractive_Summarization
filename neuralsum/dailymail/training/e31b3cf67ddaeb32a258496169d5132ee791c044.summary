half of arsonists , burglars , sex attackers and people convicted of conspiracy to murder , child abduction and sex with under - 13s avoided jail			1
the @entity25 revealed the figures showing how for some serious offences including child abduction , conspiracy to murder and assault more than half of criminals avoided jail among those walking free from court in 2012 were 736 arsonists , 69 rapists , 1,177 people convicted of sex assaults , 2,745 fraudsters , 162 who killed by reckless driving and 77 kidnappers			1

almost half of sex attackers walked free from court			2
only 1,177 of convictions for sexual assault led to a sentence			0
@entity60 suggested that the reluctance to send some serious offenders to jail could be linked to a desire to save money burglary 11,005 sexual assault total : 1,147 sexual assault on a female 1,074 sexual assault on a male 73 grievous bodily harm 1,853 rape : 69 rape of a male 16 rape of a female 53 manslaughter 13 attempted murder 4 fraud and forgery 12,515 theft of motor vehicle 486 robbery 3,335 theft from the person of another 3,826 sexual activity with child under 16 305 sexual activity with child under 13 107 child abduction 48 cruelty to or neglect of children 473 wounding or other act endangering life 144 causing death by aggravated vehicle taking 1 causing death by driving unlicensed , disqualified or uninsured drivers 9 causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs 2 manslaughter ( diminished responsibility ) 7 causing death by reckless driving 162 threat or conspiracy to murder 233 perverting the course of @entity106 violent disorder 173 kidnapping 77 blackmail 32 having possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply 3,507 possession of a controlled drug 38,675 criminal damage ( excluding arson ) 4,289 arson 736 common assault 44,532 dangerous driving 1,636 firearms offences 1,136 of the 230 guilty of sexual activity with a child under the age of 13 , only 123 were imprisoned and five spent less than six months behind bars			1
only 519 of those convicted of having sex with under - 16s were jailed			1
@entity60 questioned whether the reluctance of judges to hand down custodial sentences was fuelled by the need to save money and limit the prison population			1
fewer than a quarter ( 23 per cent ) of the 615 convicted of cruelty or neglect of children and 27 per cent of people who caused death by dangerous driving were given prison sentences			1
in 2012 , 1,354 people were convicted of arson , of which 618 were given immediate custodial sentences , including 135 jailed for more than four years			1
the coalition has repeatedly claimed to be ensuring tougher sentences are handed down to criminals			2
in october justice secretary @entity145 said : ' this government is on the side of people who play by the rules and want to get on			0
we need to teach criminals a lesson ; you will be punished for your crime			0
' tonight @entity155 , @entity60 ’s shadow justice , told @entity1 : ‘ the @entity158 public will rightly question why some people found guilty of very serious and violent crimes are avoiding going to prison			1
‘ victims of crime need confidence that those guilty of these serious crimes are properly punished			0
‘ there is a concern that one of the reasons for so many non-custodial sentences for serious offences is to save money			1
‘ for many of the most heinous offences going to prison is the only appropriate option to both punish and rehabilitate			2
this government needs to get a grip on this , and ensure that dangerous and violent crimes are properly dealt with			0
’ and @entity181 , @entity182 mp for @entity183 , said : ‘ once again we see the criminal justice system letting down victims of serious crimes because the courts are too soft on paedophiles and other horrendous criminals			0
‘ the nature of these crimes dictates that the number one priority is the victims of appalling crimes and keeping them safe			0
we need strong deterrents and that means tougher sentences			0
’ @entity199 , @entity182 mp for @entity200 , said : ‘ the criminal justice system is run for the convenience of bureaucrats – not in the interests of justice			0
‘ if we had a proper @entity182 administration we could be tackling the problem the way @entity209 tackled soggy thinking at the heart of government two decades ago			0
‘ unfortunately we ’ve got a quad at the heart of this government who seem to veto anything that looks like proper @entity182 policy			0
’ latest figures for the last week of 2013 show all but 1,561 of the 85,953 prison places were filled , with many jails are breaking point			0
of the 39,836 convicted of possession of drugs , only 1,161 or three per cent were sent to prison , along with only 3,344 of 6,851 convicted drug dealers jailed			1
a third of the 534 convicted of violent disorder avoided jail , along with a quarter of the 335 kidnappers convicted in the courts			0

justice secretary mr @entity145 said : ' since 2010 those who break the law are more likely to go to prison for longer and we are continuing to overhaul sentencing to ensure that the toughest sentencing measures are available to the courts			0
' i 'll take no lessons on being tough on crime from a @entity60 that let thousands of criminals out of prison early because they had n't provided enough places , who let thousands of offenders off with a slap on the wrist caution instead of proper punishment , and who , to add insult to injury , failed to get any money from prisoners ' earnings for their victims			1
' under @entity60 's watch , reoffending rates simply remained the same , and they had no idea what they were going to do about it			2
our reforms will help criminals away from a life of crime - and help them stay away from it			0

hundreds who kill by reckless driving or plot murder spared prison in 2012
just 45 of 93 child abductors and 123 of 230 child sex attacker were jailed
