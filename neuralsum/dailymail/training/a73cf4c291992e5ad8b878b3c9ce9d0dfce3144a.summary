by @entity1 reporter published : 13:30 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 16:22 est , 4 september 2013 a recent study shows that the more wealth a person gains , the more likely they are to become both stingier and lonelier			1
@entity6 studied a @entity8 village for forty years and watched its residents grow progressively distant from one another as they became richer			1
and she says the same thing has happened to the @entity12 as a nation			1
by surveying the contents of a million books printed between 1800 and 2000 , @entity14 found that @entity12 have used progressively fewer words like ‘ give ’ and more like ‘ get ’ over the last 200 years , indicating a serious trend toward individualism she says is all because of money			1
care to give : studies find that getting richer often means getting stingier and lonelier because people require communities less as they become wealthier ‘ the frequency of the word “ get ” went up , and the frequency of the word “ give ” went down , ’ @entity14 told @entity29			2
@entity14 , a researcher with @entity31 ’s department of @entity32 , used @entity35 ’s @entity34 viewer to assess changes in word use over the years			2
‘ words that would show an individualistic orientation became more frequent , ’ @entity14 said			0
‘ examples of those words were “ individual , ” “ self , ” “ unique			0
” words that would represent a more communal or more family orientation went down in frequency			0
some examples of those words are “ give , ” “ obliged , ” “ belong			2
” ’ @entity14 ’s findings also use her forty years of tracking families in @entity47 , @entity8 , where she found that as villagers grew richer , tendencies toward individualism grew stronger and community bonds became weaker			1
make more , give less : a study in 2001 found that the less money a household makes , the higher percentage of their income they contribute to charity and @entity14 is not alone in her assessment that poorer people are more communal			2
‘ i saw it personally — i feel it in myself , ’ said @entity64 researcher @entity63			1
‘ that somehow , when i am thinking hard about making more money and rising in wealth and enjoying materialistic benefits , i do feel personally that i am not as responsive to the needs of others			0
’ @entity63 grew up poor and says he frequently attended barbecues and other community events			1
as he ’s become wealthier and more independent , those backyard cook - outs have become much less frequent			0
to give or receive ? @entity75 assessed a million @entity12 books and found that the use of ' give ' has declined markedly since 1800 still going : after the 1970s , the word ' get ' sees a spike in use in @entity12 books , while give continues to drop the professor of psychology studied money ’s effect on individualism and generosity			1
he found that increased wealth leads to less generosity , charitableness , trust , and helpfulness			2
‘ in just about every way you can study it , ’ he said			0
‘ our lower - class individuals volunteer more , they give more of their resources — they 're more generous			0
’ both researchers have concluded that the poor simply need social connections more , that they ’re more reliable on the community safety net			0
‘ the wife may make the clothes for the whole family , ’ @entity14 found while studying the @entity8 village			1
‘ the husband grows food and builds the shelter for the whole family			0
therefore giving , social obligation , belonging to a family are very important			0
’ @entity12 ’s wealth has come at a price , said @entity63			1
‘ as we rise in wealth , along with that rise in wealth comes ideas of individuality and self - expression and autonomy and freedom , ’ he said			0

a study from @entity64 *'s* @entity63 finds that *isolation* and a *decrease* in generosity occur as personal wealth increases
another study tracked a @entity8 village and watched giving and community *activities* drop as wealth grew
since 1800 , @entity12 have used the word ' get ' in print progressively more than the word ' give '
