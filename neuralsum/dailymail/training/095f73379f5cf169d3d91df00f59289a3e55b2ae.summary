today the cemetery in @entity48 , a commune in the northwestern suburbs of @entity3 , is filled with elaborate tombs to beloved pets			1
famous residents include the canine star of 27 @entity7 films @entity8 who at one point is said to have received the most votes for the @entity58 for @entity59 - but was declined because he was n't human			1
@entity61 , 73 , from @entity62 , visited the cemetery to see for himself the hidden treasure outside the @entity17 capital			1
@entity61 , who runs the website @entity67 - n - fur , said : ' it contains not only dogs , but a fair number of cats and a variety of other species , including a lion , a monkey , a racehorse , mice , birds , rabbits and more , even fish			2
' the founders of the cemetery , lawyer @entity82 and journalist @entity83 , formed a company and acquired a strip of land on a small island near the @entity90 , which is where it remains today , although the site is no longer an island it is close to the river			2
a couple of multi-plots here , with three cats buried together on the left and another three on the right in life and death : one of the resident cats wanders the graveyard ( left ) while a small tomb commemorates @entity106 ( right ) an oriental tribute to 14 - year - old pet dog @entity108			1
the cemetery is still in use , although apparently many residents of @entity48 are unaware of its existence ' the cemetery is still in use , although apparently many residents of @entity48 are unaware of its existence			2
' just inside the site , near the entrance , the visitor is greeted by a large and elaborate memorial dedicated to the legendary @entity121 , who died in 1814			2
' according to the inscription he was responsible for saving 40 lives in the @entity125 , including that of a young boy trapped on an icy , inaccessible ledge			0
' but @entity130 was killed in the rescue of the 41st person			0
@entity130 himself is not actually buried here , his body was stuffed and is displayed in the @entity136 @entity135 in @entity137			0
' @entity61 said despite being very popular at the start the cemetery did fall on hard times in recent years and was almost closed			2

the cemetery is also home to a lion , a monkey , a racehorse , mice , birds , rabbits and fish @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 ( who reached an impressive 19 - years - of - age ) share this plot			2

' however , supporters and lovers of the old cemetery , had other ideas			0
as a result the mayor 's department of the town prepared a plan to save it and requested the state authorities to list the site as one of historical interest			0
' eventually this was agreed and it was recognised as being of ' picturesque , artistic , historical and legendary interest ' and its immediate future was secured			0
' @entity189 was done to consolidate the river bank at the site , and from february 1 , 1997 , the community of @entity192 took over responsibility for the cemetery			0
' @entity61 said the memorials to pets range from the simple unmarked to the very elaborate			1
he said : ' often you 'll see graves with a picture of the cat or dog , and then you 'll see them modified to have another added and the pets are buried in the same plot			0
' the @entity17 seem to have really gone overboard with some of the memorials perhaps as only the @entity17 can			0
' saving a place ? another of the cemetery 's resident cats sits among the plant pots , some two metres above his fallen comrades			1

built in 1899 after @entity20 told they could n't *discard* dead pets in rubbish
