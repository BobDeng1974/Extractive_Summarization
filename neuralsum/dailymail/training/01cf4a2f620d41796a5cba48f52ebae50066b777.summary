by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 13:30 est , 12 november 2013 ruling : mr @entity1 today dissolved the sham marriage at the @entity3 after he decided that the victim lacked the mental capacity to make the decision to marry a @entity8 man groomed a teenager with learning difficulties before marrying her in a desperate attempt to stay in @entity12 , the @entity3 heard today			1
the immigrant wanted to wed his vulnerable victim believing he would avoid being deported because it would breach his human rights			1
judge mr @entity1 said today exploiting ' young and vulnerable ' adults by targeting them for sham marriages will not be tolerated by the courts , as he struck out their marriage as unlawful			1
sitting in the @entity21 , the judge said the man , who is in his twenties , exploited and took advantage of her ' for the purpose of seeking to bolster his immigration appeal and his prospects of being permitted to remain in this country '			1
he was deported in 2012			1
declaring the ceremony a ' non-marriage ' , the judge emphasised : ' it is vital that the message is clearly sent out to those who seek to exploit young and vulnerable adults that the courts will not tolerate such exploitation			1
' none of the parties can be named because of a court order			0
the young woman at the centre of the case , who is now aged 19 , is referred to as @entity43 in the ruling , and the man as @entity46			1
mr @entity1 said it was ' plain on the facts of this case ' that @entity46 ' exploited and took advantage of @entity43 for the purpose of seeking to bolster his immigration appeal and his prospects of being permitted to remain in this country ' , adding that the june 2012 ceremony he and @entity43 engaged in at @entity46 's home ' formed the bedrock of that objective '			1
he said : ' @entity46 well knew that @entity43 had learning difficulties and was a vulnerable young woman			0
he knew that the police and the care services were extremely concerned about his involvement with @entity43			0
' i can reach no other conclusion than he deliberately targeted @entity43 because of her learning difficulties and her vulnerability			0
the courts will not tolerate such gross exploitation			0
' the judge added : ' fortunately , it would appear that @entity46 's involvement in @entity43 's life is not now causing her emotional distress or harm			2
' it was , however , yet another abusive and exploitative episode in her life which could have had serious physical , emotional and psychological consequences for her			0
' he said : ' in my judgment it is important for sy that a declaration of non-marriage is made in respect of the june 2012 ceremony			1
' there are also , in my judgment , compelling reasons of public policy why sham ' marriages ' are declared non-marriages			2
it is vital that the message is clearly sent out to those who seek to exploit young and vulnerable adults that the courts will not tolerate such exploitation			0
' cynical : the @entity3 heard that the @entity8 male - known as @entity46 - had hoped the sham marriage would help his human rights case - but he was still deported in 2012 the judge 's message came as part of a ruling involving an application made by a local authority in the @entity21 in respect of the capacity of the young woman to litigate and to make decisions relating to her life			1
in his conclusions , mr @entity1 states : ' it is plain from all of the evidence before me that @entity43 lacks the capacity to litigate and the capacity to make decisions about her residence , her contact with others , her care package and to enter a contract of marriage			1
' he ruled that she does have the capacity to consent to sexual relations			2
@entity46 , who was born in @entity8 , came to the @entity12 in 2009 as a student			2
his application to continue his studies was refused and his appeal was dismissed on the basis of a tribunal finding that he had submitted two forged documents and had attempted to deceive the immigration authorities			0
his rights of appeal were exhausted in june 2011			2
the judge said : ' it is in this context that he began a relationship with @entity43 in august 2011			2
' on or around june 15 2012 he was arrested for immigration offences and detained by the @entity149 pending his deportation			0
he claimed asylum on the basis that he feared he would be killed by his family who disapproved of his marriage to a white @entity12 woman			0
in july 2012 his appeal against the refusal to grant him asylum was dismissed on all grounds - his relationship with @entity43 ' lay at the heart of the case he sought to mount ' - and he was deported the following month			1
the judge said : ' happily it appears that after particularly difficult and turbulent experiences over , at least , the last eight years , @entity43 is now settled and contented in her current placement			0
she is enjoying her college course which she embarked on a few months ago			0
' he added : ' it is pleasing to note that @entity43 has been successfully assisted with an appropriate placement , care package and support to be leading a stable and happy life with positive experiences for her			0
