it 's the home of @entity1 , pirates and a civil war that has ground on for almost three decades but for some intrepid tourists , @entity5 , or to be specific , the breakaway region of @entity7 , has become the perfect place for a holiday			1
and as these incredible images taken by @entity13 photographer @entity12 reveal , there 's no shortage of things to do - whether you 're in the market for a spot of culture or fancy a day on one of the country 's spectacular @entity22 beaches			1
' to most people , @entity5 and @entity7 are one and the same , ' explains @entity26 who travelled to the region with @entity12			1
' hardly anyone speaks of its struggle for independence and desire to disassociate itself from the violent turmoil afflicting the rest of the country			2
' welcome to @entity7 : an elderly man photographed in the town of @entity39 in front of a huge mural that depicts the national flag of @entity7 keeping the peace : many of @entity7 's police force are female and boast specially adapted uniforms complete with the @entity48 hijab headscarf meet the locals : according to @entity12 and @entity52 , most of @entity7 's inhabitants are only all too aware of the image problem created by neighbouring @entity5 precious : livestock is a key source of wealth in @entity7 , with camels proving particularly valuable			1

@entity7 has functioned independently of the rest of @entity5 since 1991 and was once known as the @entity7 , only joining the rest of @entity5 , formerly @entity63 @entity7 , after gaining independence from the @entity65 in 1960			1
but by 1988 , relations between the inhabitants of @entity7 and the rest of @entity5 had disintegrated beyond repair , with a series of massacres ordered by former @entity5 dictator @entity71 proving the spark that triggered a vicious civil war			1
when the beleaguered @entity5 government finally collapsed in 1991 , @entity7 declared itself independent , although it is yet to be recognised as such by the rest of the world			1
now , despite its proximity to regions controlled by @entity1 and to @entity80 , another breakaway region and home to @entity5 's notorious pirates , @entity12 and @entity52 say travelling in @entity7 is safe			1
' media attention has traditionally focused on the ongoing war between the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) , which is backed by the international community , and @entity1 , an @entity87 affiliate , ' explains @entity26			2
' most of the unrest is concentrated in an area referred to in @entity7 as the " @entity91 " , which , as the name implies , comprises the bottom portion of the country including the capital , @entity96			2
scars : the rusting remains of a @entity100 era tank outside the port of @entity102			0
@entity7 has been at peace since breaking away from @entity5 in 1991 busy : a man outside his popular patisserie in the town of @entity107 ( left ) and an elderly man selling the popular narcotic khat outside his house in @entity39 non-violent : a young man in a dapper pink shirt poses in front of a sign that proclaims that weapons are banned in @entity117 , the capital of @entity7 's @entity119 province stunning : a colourfully dressed woman and children emerge from a house that dates back to the @entity123 in @entity7 's port city of @entity102 empire : the @entity123 conquered @entity7 in the 1500s and remained until the @entity65 took control			1
buildings such as this , in @entity102 , remain beauty : both of these women are wearing qasil ; a popular local beauty treatment made from ground leaves that firms the skin while protecting it from the sun colourful : a woman photographed in a traditional pink niqab in the city of @entity107			0
like @entity5 , most of @entity7 's inhabitants are @entity145 ' coverage has also focused largely on piracy in the @entity148 where 16,000 to 22,000 ships , roughly eight per cent of the world ’s trade , pass through annually			1
the sea bandits are based in @entity80 , the easternmost part of the country and the very tip of the horn of @entity157			0
' by contrast , @entity7 has a democratic government and the streets of its capital , @entity162 , are peaceful			1
and despite being unrecognised by much of the world , it has struck up trading relationships with a number of countries , among them the @entity65 , @entity157 and @entity168			2
now the @entity7 government hopes that the country 's stunning , deserted beaches and ancient cultural sites will encourage tourists to overcome their worries and give @entity7 a try			1
' the capital @entity162 is a vivacious place , ' reveals @entity26			0
' the busy streets are lined with vendors of all kinds and there is a @entity184 @entity183 airplane war memorial in the middle of the city			0
' the reason for all the @entity184 matériel is because @entity5 initially aligned itself with the @entity189 during the @entity190			0
but when the @entity189 intervened in the @entity191 and supported @entity5 ’s arch - rival , @entity193 , the @entity5 quickly shifted their allegiance to the @entity195			2
' further along the coast is the city of @entity102 , a port that began life as the ancient town of @entity102 in the first century @entity201 , and is described by @entity12 and @entity52 as having ' a relaxed seaside atmosphere ' , although the city centre does still bear the marks of war			0
unlike its war - torn neighbour , @entity5 , @entity7 is a peaceful democracy that boasts trade links with @entity157 , @entity168 , @entity193 and the @entity65 among others			1
but it was n't always so			0
for substantial chunks of its history , @entity7 has been ruled by foreign powers and was a part of the @entity123 for almost 400 years before being incorporated into the @entity215 as @entity7			2
then , as now , @entity7 was separate and bordered what was then @entity217			0
when independence came on the 26th june 1960 , @entity7 became a sovereign state ; a state of affairs that lasted just five days before the country became part of @entity5			1
peace , however , would prove elusive , and a tumultuous political saga soon began , thanks to the violent totalitarian regime of dictator , @entity71			0
when @entity71 ’s dictatorship was overthrown in 1991 , @entity5 quickly descended into a state of anarchy with warlords battling for power			2
on may 18th of that same year , @entity7 declared its independence from the rest of the country , attempting to reclaim what it once had			1
today , while fighting continues in the rest of @entity5 , @entity7 is now stable and hopes to be recognised as a fully independent state by the wider world			1
open for business : @entity7 is dotted with signs like this one , which is an advertising hoarding for a garage that repairs cars and sells car parts @entity247 : a man transports a traditional agal soomaali hut on the back of his camel in the @entity253 province			0
camels remain an integral part of life in @entity7 nomadic : @entity7 is still home to some nomadic tribes who spend their lives in the country 's deserts			2
here , a nomadic woman is seen with a bottle of camel milk cultural sights : the ancient @entity268 cave paintings just outside @entity102 ( left ) and the @entity183 fighter plane memorial in the centre of @entity7 's capital @entity162 trade : many of the camels raised in @entity7 are sold overseas , with @entity102 's proximity to the @entity276 making it a popular departure point within striking distance of @entity102 are the ancient @entity268 cave paintings , which are thought to date from 9,000 b.c. ' the @entity281 art depicts humans and a range of animals in a variety of positions , ' adds @entity26			1
' they 're amazingly well preserved with vibrant colours and clear outlines , and look a little bit like @entity292 's work			0
' equally impressive , reveals @entity52 , are the locals ; most of whom proved incredibly welcoming			0
' many women wear qasil , a natural beauty product that rejuvenates skin and protects from the sun , ' he adds			0
' it is made from the ground leaves of a tree and it gives their faces a yellow tint - an effect made all the more alluring when coupled with colourful clothing			0
' despite their charm , many in @entity7 are all too aware of the image problem created by the ongoing violence across the @entity5 border and hope more visitors will come to the region so they can see how different things really are			1
' the people of @entity7 are very aware of their tarnished public image due to their historical association with @entity80 and the @entity91 , ' explains @entity26			0
' in every city i visited , people urged me to show how @entity7 was different from @entity5			2
they want the world to know that it 's peaceful			0
though @entity7 may share a common history , language , and blood with the @entity91 , the people of @entity7 deserve to be seen differently			0
' culture clash : although @entity7 retains its @entity48 identity , teenagers such as this girl , right , have picked up some of the gestures found in @entity333 hip hop videos colourful : women living in @entity7 tend to choose brighter clothes than those living in @entity338 and in @entity339 and @entity340 on the other side of the @entity148 ruins : the remains of a @entity65 colonial house outside @entity345			1
many were destroyed in the fighting , leaving only the chimneys still standing modern : a man advertising x-ray services in @entity162 , where many of the best doctors in the region are found , and the lovely @entity353 just outside @entity102 ruins : a man walks through the remains of what was once the @entity358 - one of the many buildings destroyed by war in the late 1980s			0
