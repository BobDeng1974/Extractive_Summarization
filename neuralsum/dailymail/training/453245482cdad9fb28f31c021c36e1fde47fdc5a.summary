by @entity0 published : 03:45 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 08:22 est , 25 september 2012 welcome to @entity1 , where only one thing that stretches further than its sun - soaked beaches of golden sand ... traffic jams into the city			1
commuters face a daily nightmare of gridlocks that snake in and out of this metropolis of 11 million people for an average of 112 miles			1
nicknamed locally as ' @entity14 ' ( city of drizzle ) on account of its unpredictable weather , the city can see jams winding as far as 183 miles on a bad day			1
a river of blinking lights : traffic jams in @entity1 can stretch up to 295km on a bad day every morning and evening the city 's roads transform into blinking rivers of red and white lights as millions of workers edge to work yard by yard			1
one of them is mother - of - two @entity32 , whose journey can take over two hours			1
every day , she travels from her home in the north of the city to work in the south where she recently took over the family business			1
and with her 10 - month - old baby @entity40 in the passenger seat , it can be a stressful trip			2
' commuting can make your life @entity46 , ' she told the @entity47			2
' it is like a sea			2
' hell on road : every morning and evening the city 's roads transform into blinking rivers of red and white lights as millions of workers edge to work metre by metre @entity58 prevails : @entity32 met her husband @entity59 in a traffic jam on one drizzly morning nine years ago but traffic jams have become a way of life for @entity64 and are interwoven into the fabric of their daily lives			1
there is even a radio station that dedicated entirely to updating commuters on the current conditions and advising on routes to speed their journeys up 24 hours a day , seven days a week			1
' we have become slaves of traffic and we have to plan our lives around it			2
' 24 - hour road news : @entity80 sends a helicopter into the air while a team of reporters take to the roads attempting to find the least congested routes through the city ' it 's like a war ' : @entity90 , whose job is to drive around town finding traffic jams , says everybody seems to become ' very selfish ' once they are behind the wheel of a car but despite the fraying tempers and tooting horns , love can still prevail , she insists			1
it was in one such rush - hour jam that mrs @entity32 met her husband @entity59 on one drizzly morning nine years ago			1

@entity120 ( @entity121 ) , pictured ( note : @entity1 was not included in the survey ) ' it was one of those busy days of bust traffic , and i started exchanging glances with a certain somebody ... and it worked out			0
after some flirting through the windows @entity59 persuaded her to give him her phone number and later that day he called			2
' i think this is the only thing we ca n't complain about in @entity1 's traffic , ' she added			0
in a city of 11 million people , cars have become a symbol of the middle class for upwardly mobile @entity64 and an opportunity of avoid the city 's unreliable public transport system			1
it is largely thanks to @entity146 's economic boom the country has seen an explosion in car ownership			0
@entity80 has become one of the city 's most popular radio stations after launching a year ago to constantly update motorists while also offering a portal for them to vent their frustrations			1
during rush hour , the station sends a helicopter into the air while a team of reporters take to the roads attempting to find the least congested routes through the city			2
but their map - like knowledge of @entity1 's streets , they often get stuck themselves			0
' it 's like a war , because everybody seems to become very selfish once they are behind the wheel of a car , ' @entity90 , whose job is to drive around town finding traffic jams , told the @entity47 .			2

on a bad day jams can wind up to 183 miles
it has a radio station dedicated exclusively to updating drivers on road conditions
but love exists int he jams as @entity32 found when she met her husband in such a jam
in a city of *11m* people , cars have become a symbol of the middle class for upwardly mobile ' @entity64 '
