by @entity0 it seems almost an oxymoron : a blind marksman			1
yet there are dozens of men and women across @entity7 who have been trained to shoot handguns and rifles without being able to see a foot ahead of them			1
one such shooters is @entity13 , who was holding his guide dog 's harness when he boldly walked into the sheriff 's office in @entity18 , seeking a gun permit			1
a skeptical clerk told him he 'd need to pass a shooting test			0
' so then she took a picture of me , and my application then went up through the ranks , ' he told @entity27			0
' it got the signature of the chief of police of @entity18 , the sheriff and the state attorney general 's office , and they kept calling me and calling me , saying , " there 's a shooting test , there 's a shooting test			1
" ' then the day of the test came up			0
in 2012 , he made this 120 - yard neck shot with a 270 bolt action rifle @entity48 : whether they 're animals or targets , @entity49 listens in carefully to determine where to shoot @entity49 shot this 11 - foot alligator with a 44 - magnum bang stick at point blank range in the heart of the @entity58 one by one , @entity49 took out the half - size cutouts of assailants , firing the targets from about seven yards away with a .357 magnum			1
all of his shots landed near the center			0
' the deputy sheriff said : " well , you have all these stickers here telling me that you 're blind , but you passed the test , so you got your permit , " ' @entity49 told @entity27			1
the sheriff added : ' expect a lot of grief because you 're a test case for the whole system , no - one 's done this before			1
' @entity49 shot the targets by listening to the sound of the cutout being wheeled back and forth			0
he picked up the technique when he was 18 and begged a trainer to take him on a pistol marksmanship course run by the @entity84			0
the training group , which trains military officers , had no requirements that students be a part of the armed forces			0
the instructor took him on reluctantly but later was aghast : @entity49 shot better than two - thirds of his class			0
from there , he continued to perfect his art. and once he was ready , in 2008 , @entity49 moved on to hunting			0
@entity99 is one of the dozens of blind people that @entity49 taught to shoot @entity49 listens to ducks fly across the sky , tracing the sound of wings with the barrel of his rifle , picking up on their sounds as if it were bicycle tires on a pavement			1
for elk , a companion will whisper general directions to him , much like a sniper 's spotter would in a combat situation			1
' in the beginning i thought it was a joke , that somebody was blind and wanted to go on alligator hunt , ' @entity125 , who a hunting business in @entity58 , told @entity27			1
' then i sent an email back and i guessed he was serious , ' he added			0
' and once i got him on the phone , you know , he said that he was having a hard time finding anybody that would take him			0
that 's what the sad part was			1
everybody thought he was n't capable of doing it			1
he was definitely capable of doing it , if he had instructions			0
' @entity99 uses a sonic scope of his own design , which translates visual information into audio cues so he knows where the target is @entity49 , who once shot a black bear , owns about nine guns , including an @entity148			1
he says he has mentored nearly 100 blind people on how to shoot			1
one of his students , @entity99 , uses a sonic scope of his own creation to shoot			1
' i found out that it worked best with a telescope , ' @entity99 , who invented a device that translates visual information into audio cues , told @entity27			0
' at about the same time my best friend @entity160 was getting into target shooting , and he said , " why do n't we try mounting it on a gun and seeing how it works ? " ' @entity99 takes pride in his marksmanship			2
he is quick to point out that searching on @entity168 for the term ' world 's best target shooter ' returns a video of him on his range			2
but he does n't go around boasting ' i learned from @entity13 that you want to be somewhat discreet , ' @entity99 told @entity27			1
@entity49 shot this whitetail buck with crossbow in @entity179 in 2010 for many of the people @entity49 teaches , carrying a gun is not just for sport			2
' being blind you 're naturally more vulnerable to the criminal element , ' @entity49 told @entity27			2
' you 're naturally more a pedestrian			0
you ca n't avoid a dangerous situation or run from one if an attack occurs			2
' so you 're going to have to stand and fight with whatever means you have available			0
for me , that 's a 9mm pistol			2
' permits to carry guns are issued at the state level , and each state has its own rules on who can get a weapon			2
@entity49 had no problem getting a permit in @entity205 , where the statute has no language preventing a blind person from qualifying for one			2
in @entity58 , however , he could be denied one because the law says ' physical inability to handle a firearm safely ' could be a reason for denial .			0

@entity13 wo n't let his disability keep him away from his passion for guns
he says he 's taught nearly 100 blind people around the country to shoot
