although it now stands miles from the nearest major water source , the extraordinary shapes were shaped by erosion due to rainwater in the @entity14 era			2
it attracts hikers and photographers keen to see its colourful and undulating forms , but only 20 people are allowed to enter the desert each day to seek out the @entity23 landmark - with the trek taking two hours in the desert heat			1

@entity41 added : ' it is really hard to find , @entity62 does n't work over there , because the region stands on magnetic stones			2
' surprisingly , the wave is really small - it has three entrances like the letter @entity69 , but when you enter it , it seems really big			0
' the snapper had done his research on the rock formation and was delighted to eventually take the breathtaking picture			0
he continued : ' it looks like this because of the water			0
millions of years ago there was a lot of water and now there is only desert and wind			1

' @entity106 told us that last year some people did n't return from the desert - and it 's really dangerous to stay in there at night			1
' my legs were burning because i was carrying a very heavy backpack and it was hard to climb this small , but very steep mountain			0
' @entity41 has only been a photographer for two years , and he could n't have been happier with what he saw			2
