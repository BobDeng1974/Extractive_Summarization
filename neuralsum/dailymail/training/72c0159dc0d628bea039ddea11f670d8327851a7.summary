by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 19:18 est , 27 february 2013 fashion designer dame @entity1 has called @entity3 ‘ irresponsible ’ and a ‘ blind feminist ’ for denouncing @entity6 rape suspect @entity5			1
she criticised miss @entity3 ’s decision to condemn @entity5 earlier this month for his refusal to face allegations of rape and sexual assault in @entity12			1
@entity5 , 41 , skipped bail when facing extradition to @entity15			1
he has been holed up in the @entity17 embassy in @entity18 since june , facing instant arrest if he steps outside			0
dame @entity1 , pictured left , has accused @entity3 , pictured right , of ' blind feminism ' for saying @entity6 founder @entity5 should go to @entity12 to face sexual assault allegations he denies committing the sex attacks , and says he fears that , if extradited , he will be moved to @entity24 where he faces years in jail for publishing top secret @entity24 diplomatic communiques on the internet			1
miss @entity3 , 39 , lost the £ 20,000 she had provided as a surety for him to the @entity31 courts when he jumped bail			1
she now believes he needs to go to @entity12 and fight the allegations			1
@entity34 has criticised miss @entity3 for turning on the @entity6 founder , less than 18 months after the pair were guests at @entity5 ’s 40th birthday party			1
writing on her blog , she said : ‘ i believe that misapplied feminism is holding @entity5 in legal limbo , women living in the privileged world who blindly support feminism , not seeing the wood for the trees			2
‘ the word “ rape ” has been mentioned though there are no facts to support the allegation			0
‘ women want this cleared up			0
“ i wish he would go to @entity12 to answer the claims ” they say			2
holed up : @entity3 lost the £ 20,000 she provided to the @entity31 courts as a surety for @entity5 when the @entity6 founder , pictured at the @entity17 embassy , skipped bail when facing extradition to @entity15 ‘ do they really want our hero to satisfy their wish and vindicate himself by spending the rest of his life in a @entity24 @entity72 jail ? ‘ @entity5 is in danger because through @entity6 he exposed the killings our authorities cover up in wars which cause death and rape			1
‘ so i was sad and puzzled when my friend @entity3 joined the ranks of these irresponsible women			2
i hope she will change her mind			0
’ the designer ’s suggestion that sexual assault allegations are worthless without additional evidence has angered campaigners			1
last night a spokesman for the women ’s aid charity , which works to end domestic violence , criticised her assertion that there were no ‘ facts ’ to support the case			0
she said : ‘ her comments are thoughtless and ill - advised			0
they do n’t help the feminist cause and certainly do n’t help victims of rape			0
‘ we ’re not talking about someone making a spurious claim , we ’re talking about women who have made a complaint to the police			0
‘ we should n’t be giving credence to the suggestion that there needs to be more evidence than a woman ’s claim she was raped			0
‘ most people think @entity3 has done a noble thing saying “ enough is enough ”			2
‘ i thought @entity1 was the archetypal feminist , i ’m not sure what ’s changed in her life			0
