by @entity0 published : 08:25 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 02:15 est , 8 january 2014 a parish council has wasted £ 14,000 of taxpayers ' money after barricading a retired couple in their own back garden with a 6ft fence , blocking their route to a public park			1
village hall officials erected the wooden barricade in front of the @entity13 's garden gate , blocking their access to a nearby piece of public land			1
but the authority was forced to tear down the wooden fence after losing a three - year legal battle , branded a ' tragic waste of public money ' by mr @entity22			1
when the couple replaced an old hedge with a fence and gate three years ago , @entity23 argued the couple had no right to an easement - a right of passage			1
@entity33 and @entity34 were forced to take legal action after their local parish council erected a fence in front of their garden gate queen @entity40 in @entity42 were forced to remove the fence after the three - year legal battle was settled on the eve of the matter going to court			1
the @entity47 can now access the public park , as they had done for 16 years before the saga began three years ago but the couple insisted the right of way was written into the deeds of their five - bedroom property , which they bought for £ 400,000 in 1993			1
the @entity42 council refused to remove the obstruction forcing the @entity47 to take legal action			2
the ensuing three - year battle has cost the council £ 14,121 in taxpayers ' money - nearly twice the authority 's annual budget			2
the matter was finally settled in favour of the couple on the eve of the case going to court			0
the 6ft by 7ft wooden fence has been removed from the bottom of the @entity13 ’s garden , giving the couple their access back			1
the three - year dispute has cost the parish council £ 14,000 of taxpayers ' money , nearly twice its annual budget mr @entity22 , a 65 - year - old retired management consultant , revealed the outcome of the squabble in a message enclosed in @entity86 cards sent to his family and friends			1
he said : ' we are delighted to confirm that @entity90 have , after imposing nearly three years of painful struggle on us , removed their barricade and returned us to the position we enjoyed before they took their unexplained action			0
' in total , they have spent £ 14,121 on legal fees trying to justify and defend their actions and this would seem to be a tragic waste of public funds especially when realising that the status quo is restored and we are returned to the position we enjoyed before they erected their barricade			1
' we believe we are all entitled to ask the parish council why they spent an enormous sum of public money on a pointless exercise and why our annual precept has risen from £ 8,000 to £ 20,446 over a two year period , a rise of 256 per cent at a time when the total precept of all the parishes in @entity42 has risen by just 2.7 per cent			2
' the saga began in 2011 when mr @entity22 , from @entity118 , near @entity119 , set about replacing a scruffy hedge and gate with a new wooden fence and entrance			1
the boundary backs on to a public park with a play area that the couple ’s grandchildren enjoyed when they visit			2
he wrote out of courtesy to the parish council to let them know what he was doing , prompting them to order him to close the access point altogether			2
the couple had used their access to the park for years , since buying their five - bedroom home in @entity42 in 1993			0
mr @entity22 said : ' this would seem to be a tragic waste of public funds especially when realising that the status quo is restored and we are returned to the position we enjoyed before they erected their barricade ' they then sent two workmen to erect the barricade which has prevented the @entity47 from using the gate			1
mr @entity22 said : ' we replaced a hedge and field gate with a fence and a small pedestrian gate			2
' for some unexplained reason , the council told us we could not have a gate			0
' as long ago as july 19 , 2012 , they wrote to us and admitted we have an easement , that it is still in operation and that it is accessed across our boundary			0
' sadly , they refused to include this unambiguous acceptance in a settlement , instead insisted the easement , explicitly identified in our conveyance , was in their gift			0
' the case was prolonged as a result of the council ’s refusal to recognise in a settlement the easement granted in the 1968 conveyance			0
' @entity181 , vice chairman of @entity90 , insisted the officials had acted in the best interests of the parish			0
he said : ' we are pleased a satisfactory agreement has been reached in relation to the dispute			0
' the gateway was erected in a provocative manner and after that negotiations between the two parties failed			0
' we never brought the case but having been placed in a difficult position the parish council is pleased to be able to draw a line under the matter without added expense			0
' despite physical , photographic and documented evidence to the contrary , mr @entity181 insisted that no barricade had been put up by the council .			0

@entity204 began three years ago when @entity33 and @entity34 replaced an old hedge with a fence and garden gate

mr @entity22 brands *debacle* a ' tragic waste of money ' as fence is torn down
