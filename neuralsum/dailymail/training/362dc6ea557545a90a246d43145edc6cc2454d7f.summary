researchers in the @entity9 say their easy - to - use kit could be available to consumers as early as next year , meaning men focussed on their fertility issues would no longer have to endure frequent trips to the doctor to test their sperm			1
@entity16 and @entity17 , who founded a startup company to develop their device , say the tests can give a result within minutes			2
scientists say they have invented a portable fertility test enabling men to test the quality of their sperm from the privacy of their own homes , without enduring frequent trips to a doctor they are now working on a mobile app so that men can use their phones to study to results of the test , and learn how to discuss them with doctors			1

' the scientists came up with their idea while working at @entity44 in @entity45 , where they created a device that quickly detects toxins or other biological threats in emergency first responders			0
mr @entity16 , who with his partner is now looking to market the device to consumers through a partnership with an established medical company , said that fertility solutions have traditionally been more focused on women the pair then licensed the technology from @entity44 , which formed the basis for their device , and in 2012 , they founded @entity60 , to develop the fertility - test kit , which they called @entity63			1
