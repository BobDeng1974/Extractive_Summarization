by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor ministers say they are ' minded ' to go ahead with plain packaging for cigarettes the government has cleared the way to for cigarettes to be sold in plain packs , despite an outcry from @entity10 @entity9 about the ‘ nanny state ’			1
health minister @entity12 said she is ‘ minded ’ to ban branded packs after an official study found it would lead to a ‘ modest but important reduction ’ in smoking rates			1
but in the @entity17 she faced stiff criticism from conservatives , who claimed the next step would be to force alcohol to be sold in brown paper bags			2
the government has been bitterly divided over the issue of cigarette packaging and its impact on persuading people to give up smoking			2
last year @entity30 was accused of caving in to big tobacco after the idea was shelved to allow the @entity10 to focus on winning votes based on the economy and welfare			2
but health ministers were furious , and commissioned a review by sir @entity38 , a former smoker , which today said putting cigarettes in drab and unattractive packaging would contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of smoking			1
smoking groups claime that stripping cigarette packets of branding would lead to an increase in the illicit trade of tobacco products and job losses			2
miss @entity12 said : ‘ @entity52 kills nearly 80,000 people each year in @entity54 alone and our cancer outcomes stubbornly lag behind much of @entity57			1
‘ quite apart from the enormous pressure this creates on the @entity61 , it is a cruel waste of human potential			2
‘ yet we know that the vast majority of smokers want to quit and even more tragically we also know that two - thirds of smokers become addicted before they are 18			0
as a nation therefore we should consider every effective measure we can to stop children taking up smoking in the first place			0
she added that wanted to move forward as swiftly as possible , explaining : ‘ i am currently minded to proceed with introducing regulations to provide for standardised packaging			1
’ but the move was repeatedly criticised in the @entity77			0
@entity78 said : ‘ the logical extension of what she is proposing is that we put brown paper bags over all alcohol			0
‘ conservatives believe in freedom and the best way to stop smoking is through education , not by banning things			1
’ a study by sir @entity38 found banning branded packets would have a modest but important impact on reducing smoking sir @entity94 said : ‘ i do not believe that this is a @entity96 measure , it is an example of the nanny state			0
’ @entity100 mp @entity99 said : ‘ one unintended consequence of hiding cigarettes behind shutters and putting them in standardised packaging may only increase the desire of inquisitive children to take up smoking			0
’ however , health campaigners hailed the review into standardised cigarette packaging as a ‘ significant step ’ towards its introduction			1
@entity115 's chief executive @entity113 said : ‘ this should happen as quickly as possible			0
we have the evidence and the overwhelming support of parliament , the health community and the public			1
no more time should be wasted			0
’ @entity123 , chief executive of health charity @entity124 ( @entity124 ) , said : ‘ sir @entity38 has quite rightly concluded that there is a strong public health case for standardised packaging of cigarettes and tobacco packaging , and that the tobacco industry 's arguments against the policy are spurious			1
’ dr @entity134 , chief executive of the @entity135 , added : ‘ we now look to the government to take heed of sir @entity38 's review and ensure that legislation on ' plain ' standardised packaging is implemented at the soonest possible opportunity			0
’ pro-smoking groups and tobacco companies criticised the review			0
@entity145 , managing director of @entity146 said : ' nothing has changed since last summer when the prime minister said " there is n't yet sufficient evidence for it and there is considerable legal uncertainty about it ”			1
' the @entity38 report expilcitly references the " limitations " of the evidence presented by a small group of tobacco control lobbyists			0

health minister @entity12 says she is ' minded ' to impose a ban
but in the @entity163 warn against *eroding* freedom
