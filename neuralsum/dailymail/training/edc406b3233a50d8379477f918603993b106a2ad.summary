by @entity1 reporter published : 04:15 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 05:23 est , 10 december 2013 experts have accused the government of ' mass child neglect ' over decades of failure to get @entity7 's children exercising			1
a team of researchers , backed by @entity11 football manager @entity10 , condemned the fact that fewer than a third of children meet the most basic fitness levels			1
and they blasted all political parties for failing to discuss the problem in public or start a national debate about children 's health			1
damning : backed by @entity11 manager @entity10 , pictured , the report attacked a lack of debate writing in the @entity28 , the report 's authors claimed leadership and strategy were ' totally absent ' and politicians had ' neglected state policy on child physical activity for decades '			1
that is despite research showing regular exercise makes children perform better at school , curbs anti-social behaviour and improves their health			2
the experts also condemned £ 300 million ploughed into primary school @entity42 in the two years after the @entity43 as a ' derisory gesture '			2
' it is nearly one year following the @entity46 , with political and @entity43 bid promises of youth health and sporting legacies turning rapidly into a distant memory , ' they wrote			2
' the minimal funding , lack of interest and absence of a child physical activity strategy strongly support the notion that the state is failing to act to prevent harm against children and failing to meet children 's basic physical needs , likely to result in the serious impairment of their health and development			1
' this is quite literally indistinguishable from the government 's own definition of child neglect			0
' inspiration : but the victories of @entity72 ( left ) and @entity73 ( right ) were overshadowed by the report , which said a £ 300m post-olympic pot for primary school @entity42 was little more than a ' derisory gesture ' the report was written by experts from @entity79 , @entity81 @entity80 and the @entity82			2
just 21 per cent of girls and 33 per cent of boys aged four to 15 meet minimum levels of physical activity , they said - adding children spend seven to eight hours a day being sedentary			0
they wrote : ' while physical activity guidelines recommend children to spend at least an hour a day being physically active , schools are able to provide no physical education , optional physical education or limited physical education opportunities			0
' furthermore , a lack of focus , political and public debate on these issues highlights a lack of interest of political parties and education authorities in the physical literacy of our children and future citizens			1
' given the overwhelming evidence supporting physical activity for the physical health , mental health and productivity of children , the lack of policy , lack of cross party debate and interest , lack of leadership and strategic action on physical activity within schools are complicit and tantamount to state child neglect			0
' the amount of time children spend on pe and sport is neither monitored nor known by the authorities , they said - and there is no statutory minimum time schools must devote to @entity42			1
they added that even though @entity133 came third in the olympic medals table , women and men from @entity7 came first and second , respectively , in @entity138 's obesity rankings			0
a government spokesman said : ' this government is taking decisive action to harness the @entity43 spirit and make sure every child has the opportunity to be fit and healthy			0
' we have extended our ringfenced funding for primary schools to spend on sport to 2015/16 - with a total of £ 450m now going directly to headteachers to improve @entity42 and sport in their schools			0
' in addition we have spent £ 3 million to extend @entity156 sports clubs to schools in areas with the highest childhood obesity , we are targeting funding to get more 11 to 25 - year - olds playing sport , and we are investing in facilities to strengthen grassroots sport up and down the country			0
