others are of an age to remember the catastrophic @entity10 earthquake and tsunami in 1923 which wiped out up to 135,000 @entity13 residents			0
there are even some that were born before the city 's main railway station opened			2
but some are not old enough to have explored @entity13 's vast urban sprawl at all yet			0
a fascinating new collection of pictures from a @entity24 photographer features @entity13 residents from the cradle ( almost ) to the grave featuring 101 photos of different people of every age from newborn babies to 100 year olds			1
toddlers : these two pictures featured in 100 years in @entity13 show two of the city 's youngest residents - they are both aged two teenagers : this pair are both aged 16			2
the are among 2,500 strangers approached to have their picture taken by @entity43 growing up : this pair , pictured in @entity37 's bustling urban sprawl , are both aged 27 @entity43 , armed with his camera , spent three years approaching complete strangers in the @entity49 capital city and asking if he could take their photo to complete his 100 years in @entity13 project			1
when a resident was n't too shy to say no to @entity43 - many refused - he would ask them their age and collected a photo of a male and a female tokyoite for each year up to his oldest subjects , a pair of centenarians			2
@entity43 estimates that he approached around 2,500 people and amassed a collection of 500 pictures during his time on the project			1
life begins at 40 : these two are about to enter their fifth decade - they are both aged 39 not shy : of the 2,500 approached by @entity43 , just 500 people agreed to have their picture taken for the book , including these two aged 48 good eye for an age : @entity43 says that when he became adept at guessing people 's ages despite @entity49 people looking younger than their years			1
he guessed that these two were both aged 60 but he admitted that when he set out on his mission to collect such a vast range of ages , he was n't sure if it 'd be possible			0
a freelance photographer , working mainly for magazines and businesses , 100 years in @entity13 is @entity43 's first personal project			1
his collection manages not only to capture the entire spectrum of @entity88 in terms of age , the images he shot depict the city 's diversity , not only in terms of location - he took pictures all other @entity13 - but of the different types of people who live there			2
the images feature people from all manor of backgrounds , from students to labourers and one shot even features a homeless man			0
diverse : his pictures do n't only capture a spectrum of ages - these two are both 74 - they also capture the city 's diversity all ages : the group of pictures features all manor of subjects , from babies to labourers to people in residential care			1
these two were 94 when the shots were taken @entity122 : this man and woman were among the oldest people photographed by @entity43 - they were both aged 100 @entity43 told the @entity126 that he became an expert at guessing people 's ages while collecting the pictures			1
he said : ' the funny thing is , for western people it 's difficult to tell some people 's ages here because @entity49 people look much younger than they are			1
' but when i was doing it , i got very good at it			0
' when i needed , say , someone aged 56 , i very seldomly missed by more than two years			0
