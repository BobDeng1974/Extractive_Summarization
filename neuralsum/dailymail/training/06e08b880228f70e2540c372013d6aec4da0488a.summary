by @entity0 published : 08:14 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 10:04 est , 7 august 2013 paramedics drafted in from around the country to cover staff shortages at a scandal - hit ambulance trust are camping in tents because their poor pay means they ca n't afford to stay in hotels			1
many of the agency staff working at @entity10 , which has previously come under fire for its poor record at saving lives , live in other parts of the country			1
but they are given just £ 35 extra a day on top of their £ 10.50 - an - hour wage to cover the living expenses of working away from home			1
this has forced many of the medics temporarily working for the trust to camp as they can not afford the cost of hotels or @entity27			2
temporary home : agency paramedics drafted in to help with staff shortages at the @entity10 have been staying at a £ 15 - a - night campsite in @entity32 , @entity33 , because their £ 35 daily living allowance means they ca n't afford a hotel four paramedics - two men and two women - are currently staying in three tents at the @entity40 campsite in @entity32 , @entity33			1
the two women are sharing one tent and the two men are in individual tents with each pitch costing £ 15 per night			1
they have been recruited on behalf of the ambulance trust by health service contractor @entity46			1
the company said its £ 35 allowance was ' above the industry norm ' and described the camp site as ' great ' for their emergency workers			1
but union leaders said the allowance - to cover food and board while working away - was not enough			2
staff are understood to have been using the campsite for the past six weeks , alongside holidaying families who were stunned to see front - line @entity62 staff living ' rough '			2
new home : an ambulance worker 's uniform is visible in a car parked at the @entity68 near @entity32 in @entity33 the @entity70 service has come under fire for its poor record at saving lives @entity74 said : ' we were very shocked to see that it was ambulance people that were staying in the tents here			1
' we had no idea until we saw one of them come back quite late , make a cup of tea , then head straight to bed			0
' health minister dr @entity86 , whose constituency is served by the ambulance trust , said it was no way to look after workers meant to save lives			0
he said : ' it 's something i find very difficult to accept as being good conditions in which to house staff who have patients ' lives in their hands			0
' this is clearly something the ambulance trust will want to look at immediately as they are responsible for assigning contracts - and they need to do so			0
' @entity106 @entity105 mp @entity104 , whose constituency covers the campsite , described the situation as ' astonishing '			0
he said : ' the contractors charge a fair whack , i suspect , for the staff , so i would expect they would be able to make sure they were able to afford to stay somewhere comfortable while they 're working			2
criticism : the agency responsible for recruiting the paramedics has come under fire for forcing ' front - line staff who have patients ' lives on their hands ' to live in campsites ' @entity124 can be fun , but it 's not great if you have a very late night and want to unwind			1
' i think the agency should look very carefully at how much support it 's giving its own staff			0
' a spokesman who represents ambulance workers in the @entity131 said that contractors like @entity46 have a responsibility to house staff properly			2
regional organiser @entity135 said : ' ers have to make sure they have the right resources to do the job			0
' the £ 35 a night figure clearly is n't enough and they need to change the figure			1
' it could affect your work if you do n't sleep properly , and there 's also the hygiene aspect - how well can they shower and keep clean if they go home to a camp site ? ' but ers say they have received good feedback on the camp site			0
an @entity46 spokesman said : ' we always provide suitable financial support to ensure that all crews have sufficient rest between shifts			0
positive feedback : @entity46 , a health service contractor who recruited the paramedics on behalf of the trust , said the @entity68 near @entity32 in @entity33 was ' great ' for their staff ' we have specifically questioned our crews as to the suitability of the campsite and have received unequivocal responses that say it 's a great site with appropriate facilities and that they enjoy good sleep and comfort			1
they are not at risk			0
' the @entity10 said : ' the quality of our service delivery is of utmost importance so before working in partnership with us , private ambulance organisations must undergo a thorough trust - accredited process and meet stringent criteria			1
' those who are employed by the private ambulance services are qualified to recognised @entity62 standard			0
' paramedics working for the contractor are paid £ 10.50 an hour - roughly equivalent to a £ 21,000 - a - year salary			1
a @entity191 near the camp site has a starting rate of £ 57 , while the camp site costs just £ 15 per tent pitch			2
campsite manager @entity196 said : ' the ambulance workers are no different to the other contractors here - we 've had electricians , joiners and demolition men who all prefer camping to a @entity205			0
' it 's up to then how they use their allowance			0
' nothing out of the ordinary : @entity68 manager @entity196 said they often have contractors stay at the campsite - including electricians , joiners and now paramedics			0

@entity10 has taken on temporary agency paramedics to cover staff shortages
but many live in other parts of the country and can not afford hotels on the £ 35 daily allowance they are given to cover working away from home
they are instead staying at a £ 15 - a - night campsite in @entity32
health service contractor @entity46 claims the site is ' great ' for their staff
