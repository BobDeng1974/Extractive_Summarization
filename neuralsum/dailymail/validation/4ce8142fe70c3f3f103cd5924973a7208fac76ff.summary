@entity1 ’s pledge to crack down on immigration is no longer taken seriously by the @entity3			0
the prime minister had promised to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ by the @entity7			1
however , last month that vow was shattered when figures showed it had hit a record high			1
@entity1 ’s pledge to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ is no longer taken seriously by the @entity3 home secretary @entity14 later insisted the @entity15 would restate the failed target to slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they returned to @entity18			1
but yesterday the @entity3 heaped embarrassment on ministers by criticising the prediction			0
in a document published alongside the @entity23 , it said its previous forecasts had been ‘ underpinned by the assumption ’ that net migration – the measure of how many people have come into @entity29 minus those who have left – would be 105,000 by 2019			2
@entity14 said @entity15 would slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they stayed in power it stated : ‘ a reduction over time seems consistent with the international environment and with the government ’s declared efforts to reduce it			1
’ but in a blow to mr @entity1 , it added : ‘ in light of recent evidence , it no longer seems central to assume it will decline so steeply			0
’ instead , it said net migration would ‘ tend towards 165,000 in the long term ’			1
on taking power in 2010 , mr @entity1 pledged to bring the politically - sensitive net migration figure below 100,000			2
but last month the figure hit 300,000 – fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the @entity51 of 190,000			2
@entity52 described the figures as a ‘ disappointment ’ but also a reflection of a growing economy			0
the highest number previously recorded was 600,000 in september 2010			0
when mr @entity1 entered @entity52 in may 2010 net migration was running at 244,000			0
@entity60 immigration minister @entity59 said : ‘ @entity1 ’s “ no ifs , no buts ” pledge on net migration is in complete tatters ; not even the @entity3 believes the prime minister ’s promise any more and are now planning for it to be broken			1
‘ if you needed any more evidence that this government simply ca n’t be trusted to deliver their promises on immigration , this is it			0

@entity67 promised to reduce net migration to ‘ tens of thousands ’ by the *election*
but vow was shattered when figures last month showed it hit record high
@entity14 then vowed to cut number to 100,000 if @entity15 stay in power
but @entity3 said net migration would ‘ tend towards 165,000 in the long term ’
