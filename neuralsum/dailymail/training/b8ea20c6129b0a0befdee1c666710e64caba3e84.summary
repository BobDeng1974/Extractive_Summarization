dozens more former scouts have come forward to claim they were victims of child abuse after the movement issued an apology and admitted paying out £ 500,000 in compensation			1
yesterday , the @entity6 said it was ' deeply sorry ' after an investigation claimed it was facing more than 50 legal cases over historic sex abuse			1
today , solicitor @entity10 said 30 people called his firm overnight after seeing a @entity14 report about two historic cases			1
the @entity6 has apologised to people who were abused during their time in the organisation , saying it was ' deeply sorry for anybody hurt by the actions of abusers ' mr @entity10 , of @entity21 which has already represented around 30 alleged victims in recent years , told @entity24 's today : ' since the report on the abuse in the @entity6 went out yesterday , i have been contacted overnight by an additional 30 people			1
' i think what that demonstrates is that the figures that have come out really are the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of people who have suffered abuse			2
' he said the apology had been issued ' under intense pressure from the media '			2
' it 's convenient that that has been issued now and it serves their self - interest rather than being a genuine apology to the individual people , ' he said			2
the @entity6 denies claims , reported by the @entity14 , that 56 people have instructed solicitors to sue the association over historical abuse since october 2012			1
the @entity54 put the number of people who have launched civil actions since that time at 36 - more than double the number during the first century of the movement 's history			0
a @entity6 spokesman admitted that the organisation has tried to deal with paedophiles without telling police			1
the @entity6 said : ' we apologise to all those who have been abused during their time in scouting			1
the safety and support of young people in scouting is our number one priority			0
' any abuse of young people is abhorrent and we are deeply sorry for anybody hurt by the actions of abusers			1
we strive to ensure these abuses do not take place			0
' a spokesman added that the association had been wrong not to report past allegations to police			1
' those were inappropriate and unacceptable responses to that situation			0
these were extremely rare incidences and this should not have happened			0
we deeply regret this failure , ' the spokesman said			2
the @entity14 said that 56 people have instructed lawyers to sue over @entity6 - related abuse committed in past decades since the scale of allegations against @entity97 became known in 2012			1
earlier this year paedophile scout leader @entity98 was jailed for 12 years after admitting 26 sex offences against boys in the 1960s and 1970s and it said £ 897,000 in damages has already been paid by the movement and by individual @entity6 leaders			1
last night the association said the numbers of abuse claims had been exaggerated and that it had paid less than £ 500,000 in compensation			1
the @entity14 said one victim had been paid £ 45,000 in 2011			1
he said he had been abused by a @entity6 leader in the early 1980s at weekly meetings and during a camp			1
he said : ' i was sickened and disgusted by it			0
i wanted it to stop but i could n't make it stop			0
' i had no one i could speak to and i did n't know what to say			0
' perhaps he was clever in choosing people who he knew would n't be in a position to talk about it			0
' the scoutmaster was investigated by the police but committed suicide before the trial began , the report revealed			1
the victim later asked the association to pay for therapy to help his recovery : ' i was looking for them to help , ' he said			0
' it was a time of crisis in my own life and i was looking for someone to be there to help address the issues i was experiencing			0
' the association advised approaching the @entity141 but he decided to pursue a compensation claim to fund therapy privately , the @entity14 said			2
one of the legal firms handling claims against the @entity6 is @entity147 - based @entity21			1
lawyer @entity10 said that his firm had handled 33 claims , of which a number are still outstanding			0
of these , 24 have been made since the @entity152 abuse charges became widely known in the autumn of 2012			0
' these come from people who suffered in the 60s , 70s and 80s , ' he said			0
' it still takes great courage for people to come forward			2
' the hope is that these claims will encourage the @entity6 to put better safeguards in place to make sure this does not happen again			1
' the association told the @entity14 that safety for young people was its ' number one priority '			0
it said that in common with other organisations it had ' experienced an increase in reported historic cases since 2012			0
' the organisation denied claims that 56 people have instructed solicitors to sue the association over historical abuse since october 2012 however , it said it had paid , together with its insurers , only £ 496,500 in damages to claimants in recent times			1
the association also said it has received only 36 abuse claims since october 2012			0
before that , there had been only 12 sex abuse claims in over a century since the movement 's foundation in 1907 , it said			0
a @entity6 spokesman added that the organisation was confident that mistakes of the past would not be repeated			1
' where there is any evidence of wrongdoing , this information is automatically passed on to the police , ' he said			2
' this is in line with a clear written code of conduct that we have had in place for the last 20 years , which requires all adults in the movement to report suspected cases of abuse to the appropriate authorities			2
' earlier this year paedophile scout leader @entity98 was jailed for 12 years after admitting 26 sex offences against boys in the 1960s and 1970s			0
a court heard how the scout movement knew about allegations against him , but never told the police			2
