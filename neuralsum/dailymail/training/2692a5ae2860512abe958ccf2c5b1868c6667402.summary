by @entity0 @entity1 has emerged from his @entity3 nightmare to take charge of his first training session on his return to @entity8 side @entity7			1
the former @entity10 national side and @entity12 manager put his new charges through their paces during a training session in @entity16			2
@entity1 left his post as @entity10 boss after a disastrous end to their @entity3 last month			2
after suffering their heaviest loss in semi-final history against the @entity37 , @entity1 's misery was compounded when the five - time @entity3 winners lost again the @entity40 in their last fixture - the first time since 1940 they had lost consecutive games on home soil			0
right direction : @entity1 takes charge of his first training session at @entity7 since leaving @entity10 down and out : @entity1 was bitterly disappointed at the nature of @entity10 's @entity3 exit @entity51 becomes new @entity7 coach the 65 - year - old has returned to @entity7 for a third time , after previous stints at the helm in 1987 and between 1993 - 96			1
in his second spell in particular he enjoyed great success , winning six trophies in just three years as he began to establish himself as a highly reputable coach in @entity10			0
if his record in @entity10 prior to this is anything to go by he 'll prove to be a big success again - that 's for sure .			0

@entity1 has taken charge of his first training session at @entity7 since **quit*ting* as @entity10 manager last month
