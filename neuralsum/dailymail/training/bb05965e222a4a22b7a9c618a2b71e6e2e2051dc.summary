by @entity0 from a distance this globe may look like any other but it is in fact made from thousands of matchsticks			2
created by artist @entity7 , 56 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , the incredible creation is built from 300,000 individual matchsticks glued together facing outwards			1
each of the matches was hand painted and took two years to build			0
the matches were also coated in flame retardant to make sure the artwork did n't burst into flames			0
this sculpture , which measures 43 inches around , was made by artist @entity7 from 300,000 matchsticks the @entity20 artist took two years to paint the tip of each matchstick before gluing them together @entity20 - based artist @entity24 used satellite images of the @entity26 during @entity27 as a basis for the sculpture as well as a second - hand desktop globe to help map the contours of each country			1
built in his backyard studio , the striking piece of art weighs more than 90kg and measures 43 inches in diameter			0
@entity7 said ' i did n't have an " aha " moment , but instead the idea to build a globe made from matchsticks came to me as an subconscious idea , probably when i was half asleep or in a dream like state			1
hanging from the ceiling in mr @entity7 's backyard studio , the artwork weighs nearly 200lb ( 90kg , left )			2
viewed from a distance the highly detailed work appears just like genuine pictures of the @entity26 ( right ) not wanting his prized creation to burst into flames , mr @entity7 dipped each match in flame retardant ' i bought a desktop globe at a second hand store to help map the globe and used the latitude and longitude lines as a grid that i could transfer to my larger model			1
' each square of the grid was numbered , so i could copy the contours of the continents square by square			0
' when people see my work , they become wide eyed with gaping mouths and instantly they want to touch it			0
the sculpture also features the infamous @entity27 ( left ) which brought @entity20 to a standstill , as mr @entity7 worked from satellite images ( right ) of the storm as it hit the @entity78 while the @entity78 is modelled on satellite images , the rest of the work was created from a desktop globe mr @entity7 says the work , which consumed him for four days a week for two years , is the most labour - intensive he has ever done ' luckily , my globe is n't flammable , i painted the tips by dipping 5 matchsticks at a time in a mixture of paint , water and flame retardant			1
' although i have tried many large scale art installations in the past , this is by far the most work intensive and time consuming project i have ever done			0
