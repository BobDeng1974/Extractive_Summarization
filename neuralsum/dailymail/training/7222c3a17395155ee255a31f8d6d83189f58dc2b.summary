staying in the @entity11 is our main aim			1
that will be a huge achievement for me at this stage of my career			1
it ’s not what i ’m used to but i knew going in the door what the aims were going to be so i did n’t set my stall out any higher or lower than that			2

@entity0 says staying in the @entity11 is the main aim for @entity6 ‘ it was a shock , ’ he said			1
‘ we walked in the morning and we were all in debating it			2
then a meeting got called at 9am and the manager told us			2
‘ he was disappointed it got leaked before he could tell us and he was looking around and seeing the lads faces and everyone saying “ no chance ”			2
i looked at @entity60 , who just signed from @entity61 , just won his first league title and just seeing the disbelief and the disappointment			2

’ on @entity4 ’s penalty shootout win over @entity48 in @entity69 , @entity0 added : ‘ it ’s something you think is too far away to touch			1
you think i ’ll never get there			0
‘ i ’d lost in a semi final for @entity74 , lost in quarter - finals			0
i just thought i ’d never get close enough			0
then that day was a ridiculous feeling			0
if you could bottle the emotions on that night you ’d make a lot of money			0
@entity0 celebrates @entity4 winning the @entity9 in 2008 ‘ i was gone ( in the shootout )			1
if you see the pictures from behind , i ’m telling @entity84 ( @entity85 ) to go whichever way it was			0
luckily @entity84 did n’t see me and dived the other way and saved it and the rest is history			0
‘ i could feel my legs as if to say , “ whoa , i ’m next up how am i going to even walk up and take a penalty ? ”			0
i do n’t know if i could have hit the ball			0
i was so scared and nervous			0

‘ @entity108 was a great leader , a great captain and he ’s assistant manager now at @entity120			2
he had a few sticky roles in management and he ’ll be looking to come back and take over a club			0
‘ so it does n’t always mean you ’re guaranteed immediate success			2
@entity81 is doing it a real good way in that he ’s learning , he ’s played under sir @entity46 and @entity130			1
he ’s got a great track record and learning and honing his craft			0
i ’m sure one day he ’ll get the opportunity and then he ’s got to execute			0
