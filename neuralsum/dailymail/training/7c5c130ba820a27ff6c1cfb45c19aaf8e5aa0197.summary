musicians who want to write a chart - topping song need to move in a different musical direction than the pack , research has revealed			0
more than 25,000 songs on the @entity6 100 from 1958 to 2013 were analysed as part of the study of audio attributes			1
it found the key to a hit song was that it should sound different from anything else in the charts , but not so distant that it puts music fans off			1
@entity20 's number one song @entity18 , @entity21 and @entity23 's @entity22 , and @entity25 's @entity24 , all hit the top spot because they were distinct from other songs around at the time			2
@entity20 's number one song @entity18 hit the top spot because it was different from other songs around at the time the graph shows that songs in the top 20 show the least amount of conventionality out of any section of the @entity6 over time researchers discovered that songs that faltered in the middle of the @entity6 were most likely to sound the same , whilst weird singles failed to make the charts at all			1
the study was carried out by @entity45 , professor of organizational behaviour at @entity47 , in @entity48 , and @entity49 , a phd student in @entity50 and organisations at @entity53 's @entity52 , in @entity54			0
they used @entity57 's audio analysis program , @entity58 , to examine the singles and created a new metric called @entity60			0
as part of the study they examined 11 attributes of each song , including danceability , duration , key , temp and acousticness			0
@entity25 's @entity24 and @entity21 and @entity23 's @entity22 also went to number one because they stood out the number one song is the least conventional of the top 10			0
the top 10 are less conventional than the top 20 ' songs that are slightly less conventional than average tend to outperform their peers on the charts , ' the pair added			2
the researchers found that songs that secured the coveted number one spot moved in a different musical direction and stood out from the pack of other musical releases			1
however , mr @entity49 and mr @entity45 added : ' nevertheless , predicting hit songs is nearly impossible to do , because performance is largely contingent on a song 's relationship to other songs that are produced and released contemporaneously			2

more than 25,000 songs on the @entity6 100 over *55* years were analysed
researchers found hit songs were different from anything else in charts
but they were not so distant from others that they alienated music fans
those that were too conventional and *formulaic* faltered in the middle
weird and *strange* songs were discovered to have failed to make the chart
