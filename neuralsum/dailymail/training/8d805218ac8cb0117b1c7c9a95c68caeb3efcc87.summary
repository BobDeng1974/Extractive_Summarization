i ’m learning as i go along because there are no other children in the @entity10 with the same condition			2
‘ i had my first three - month scan with @entity4 and they told me that he had @entity40 ’s syndrome , but this was not the case			1
‘ at 11 months old they told me he had dwarfism but they could n’t give me a diagnosis			0
‘ when @entity4 was about two the doctors said to me that they had done everything they could and they just told us it was @entity4 ’s syndrome			1
’ @entity4 is so small that he still wears clothes designed for children who are between six and nine months old doctors say @entity4 is the only child in the @entity10 to have his condition so they are unable to formally diagnose him - his parents say they have been told he has ' @entity4 syndrome ' @entity4 's doctors say they have done everything they can for him			1

he is progressing well though and he ’ll continue in mainstream education while he ’s in primary school			0
’ mrs @entity30 and husband @entity24 , 28 , a labourer , are now desperate for a diagnosis and are hoping to raise £ 10,000 to take him to @entity26 for specialist tests			1
after a pregnancy scan , @entity4 's parents were told he had @entity40 's syndrome but they were later told this was not the case and that he actually has a form of dwarfism @entity4 's parents now hope to take him to see specialists in the @entity26 in the hope of getting a formal diagnosis mrs @entity30 said : ' when @entity4 was about two the doctors said to me that they had done everything they could and they just told us it was @entity4 's syndrome ' she said : ‘ we are part of a dwarfs ’ community that meets once a year and they ’ve all got a diagnosis			1
i ’d just like to say this is what he has			0
‘ going to @entity26 is our last hope really			2
