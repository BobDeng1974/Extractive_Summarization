an elderly man found living in south - central @entity1 has claimed to be a @entity3 war veteran who was presumed dead after his helicopter was shot down during a special ops mission over @entity6 in 1968			1
but despite the potentially astonishing discovery , the man 's two daughters - whom he has never contacted since disappearing - have refused to take a dna test to prove his identity			1
the wife and daughters of sgt. @entity14 , a one - time @entity15 , initially agreed to participate in dna testing , before changing their minds last year , according to a filmmaker behind a new documentary asking whether the man is indeed who he says he is			1
' somebody suggested to me maybe that 's ( because ) the daughters do n't want to know if it 's him , ' said @entity28			0
' it 's kind of like , " that was an ugly war			0
it was a long time ago			0
we just want it to go away "			0

the filmmakers claim to have tracked him down to south - central @entity1 - where the 76 - year - old is unable to remember his birthday , his @entity3 children ’s names , or how to speak @entity58			1
the makers of ' unclaimed ' say that the wiry , forgetful man could very well be a missing pow from the distressing conflict , and that fellow servicemen could ' lose their minds ' when they hear the story of how he never returned home			2
' sgt. @entity14 ' told emmy - award winning filmmaker @entity28 that when his flaming helicopter crashed to the ground during a firefight on a @entity6 mountaintop , he was captured immediately by @entity75 soldiers			1
fake ? @entity14 , a former @entity3 army @entity15 and member of an elite @entity77 , was listed as @entity78 in 1968			1
but a fellow @entity1 vet who claims he has met a man claiming to be him set off a media storm on tuesday out of sight : @entity43 ( pictured ) claims to be @entity14 , but has forgotten how to speak @entity58 ' they locked me up , high in the forest , in a cage , ' he said			1
' i was in and out of consciousness from torture and starvation			0
the @entity75 soldier hit me on the head with a stick , shouting , " @entity3 ! " ' then he would hit me even harder ; i thought i would die			2
i never said anything , though they beat and tortured me			0
' mr @entity14 said he escaped after four years , hid in the woods and was found in a field by a woman who nursed him back to health and then became his wife			1
he said he borrowed her late husband ’s surname and birth date and was registered as a @entity105 - @entity75 resident named @entity106			2
the couple then had children but no recorded attempt was made to contact his wife or children back home in @entity3			1

he was the third of five children born to @entity122 and @entity123			2
he grew up during @entity124 , and it was this influence that led him to drop out of high school at 17 so he could get his ged and join the @entity129 , according to the film makers			0
he went on to join the @entity39 , known as the @entity39 , and was later chosen to join an elite @entity131 known as @entity132 , @entity1 – @entity133 ( @entity77 )			0

a full search mission was not possible and he was declared missing in @entity138			0
on april 28 , 1976 , he was officially declared dead by the military , leaving behind a wife , @entity141 , and two daughters			2
the documentary follows the quest of @entity1 veteran @entity115 as he seeks to prove that the man he first heard about in 2008 while on a humanitarian mission was indeed a fellow serviceman			1
@entity147 contacted @entity28 to see if the filmmaker would follow his story to establish that @entity14 was still alive - but at first the director was cautious			1
' the @entity78 story was pretty unbelievable , pretty grandiose , ' he said to the @entity152			0
' i was very skeptical			0
' however , what struck @entity28 more than the idea a @entity1 veteran could have stayed undetected for 44 years was @entity115 's own journey as a soldier , alcoholic and victim of child abuse			1
@entity28 said he was inspired by how @entity115 would ' go all the way in helping someone he did n't even know			0
' he added that ' no matter how the story turned out with @entity14 , i knew there was just a great " once upon a time " with @entity115			2
' in @entity1 , @entity115 tracked down the man who was locally rumored to be a former @entity3 @entity15 who had never returned home			2
' @entity115 went to meet him and was very skeptical , grilled this guy up and down trying to get him to break , to say , " oh , no , i ’m just making it up			0
" and he was adamant he was that guy , ' @entity28 told the @entity170			0

he found that reports existed as early as 1982 of @entity14 's alleged survival , leading him to question why his family were not contacted to help provide proof			1
' why did the @entity3 leave him there for all those years ? ' @entity28 asked @entity152			2
' are there other @entity14 's in @entity1 ? ' @entity28 answered his own question , adding ' a highly - placed source has told him there are and it 's not because the @entity75 wo n't let them go , it 's more the @entity198 does n't want them to come home '			2
indeed , @entity28 said that the @entity3 government first became aware of the man as early as 1991 , and tried to verify his identity in 2006			1
the team discovered that in 2010 @entity14 was fingerprinted at the @entity3 embassy			1
his siblings were never informed			0
@entity115 was reportedly told that there was not enough proof to confirm this was @entity14 - to which they replied that there was not enough evidence to suggest he was n't			2

i was certain it was him in the video , but when i held his head in my hands and looked in his eyes , there was no question that was my brother " , ' @entity28 told the @entity170			0
this could be confirmed if @entity249 agreed to dna testing , but she said she does not need to take the test to know the man is her brother			0
