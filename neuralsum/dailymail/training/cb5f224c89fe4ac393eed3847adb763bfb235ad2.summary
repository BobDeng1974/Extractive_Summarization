' @entity30 identifies the user 's risk for the condition by taking a photo of a person 's eye , which then analyses the conjunctiva			1
the results can then be sent to doctors			0
the @entity15 medical students won over the judges with their phone app - @entity30 - which asses the risk of anaemia by taking a selfie the app identifies the user 's risk for the condition by taking a photo of their eye which then analyses the conjunctiva as part of their prize , the pair will meet with @entity8 co-founder @entity27 for a mentoring session ' we developed an idea where the processing is done online and would take one to two minutes , depending on how good you are at taking selfies , ' @entity1 said			1
' through the app , we hope it detects the condition early on and helps prevent it			2
' we 're both very interested in technology and how it can improve health			0
