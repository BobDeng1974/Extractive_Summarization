@entity1 , 34 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , admits she follows 13 - year - old @entity2 every time he leaves the house because she is still traumatised by him being snatched when he was six months old			1
@entity2 was snatched in his pram from outside a cafe in 1999 , leaving his distraught mother @entity14 not knowing if he was dead or alive			1
although he was found safe and well several hours later and his kidnapper was jailed , @entity14 ’s agony had just begun			1
@entity14 said : ' i 'm ashamed to admit what i do but the truth is , the terror of that day haunts me even now			1
' everyone thinks that when a kidnapped child is found , the story is over			0
but when my son was snatched , our lives changed forever and it was the start of the nightmare			2
now my biggest fear is i will lose him all over again			0
' while @entity2 was a toddler at home it was easy to keep him under watch - and when he started nursery , she went with him			1
when he moved up to primary school , she made sure she was always the first parent outside the gates at pick - up time			0
@entity14 also insisted on going on all school trips and staying at children ’s parties to watch over him			1
when @entity2 was six , she started having counselling to deal with her anxiety but it did little to help			1
by the age of ten , @entity2 started complaining about not being allowed to do anything on his own - so she began bribing with money and computer games to get him to stay indoors under her watchful eye			1
@entity14 , pictured with @entity2 when he was a baby , says her biggest fear is that she will lose him all over again @entity14 says : ' i tried to explain what had happened to him , but he was too young to understand really			1
' so instead , i resorted to bribing him with cash to stay home			0
like most boys his age , he soon realised he could work it to his advantage			0
' when @entity2 turned 12 , his friends started going out on their bikes , and @entity14 knew his social life would suffer unless she loosened her grip			1
that was when she started letting him out - but following him in secret			0
@entity14 said she tried bribing @entity2 with cash to stay at home because she was scared what would happen if he left the house she said : ' i never thought i could run that fast until i followed @entity2 on his bike			1
but believe me , if you 're worried about your child , you have speed you never thought you had			0
' i was very careful not to be seen , even if it meant hiding behind a wall			0
i wish i could stop but i am still terrified something will happen to him			0
' @entity14 said : ' everyone thinks that when a kidnapped child is found , the story is over - but when my son was snatched , our lives changed forever and it was the start of the nightmare ' @entity14 was single and 21 when she gave birth to @entity2 , having split up with his father with his dad when she was five months ' pregnant			1
keen to support her son , she worked at a local shoe shop in @entity9 while her parents looked after @entity2			1
but on october 12 , 1999 , the happy new mum 's life was turned upside down when her dad @entity93 burst through the door of her shop without her beloved baby			1
@entity2 as a young boy @entity14 says : ' i looked at him and the first thing i said was , " where ’s @entity2 ? " ' @entity101 looked pale and there was no buggy so i knew something was terribly wrong even before he spoke			1
' her father managed to say through tears : ' i ’ve lost him			0
' @entity14 said : ' i felt like my heart stopped			1
' @entity93 explained that he had taken @entity2 out for a walk in his buggy when he 'd been approached by a new neighbour , an 18 - year - old girl who had moved in four months earlier			1
she had tearfully explained that she was having trouble getting her wages from a local café			0
she asked @entity93 if he would go back with her for support			0
feeling sorry for the girl , he had agreed			2
but when they got to the café , the teenager offered to stand outside with @entity2 while @entity93 went to speak to the owner , who had no idea who he was talking about			2
when @entity93 came out , he discovered the girl - and his grandson - had vanished			2
he immediately went to find @entity14 at work and a huge police hunt began , complete with helicopter search teams			2
@entity14 had never met the woman who stole her baby so tried not the think the worst			2
she said : ' i tried to stay positive but at the end of the day , i did n't know what she wanted my son for			0
' @entity101 just sobbed on the sofa while i paced the floor unable to sit down			0
' it was six agonising hours before they finally got news			0
@entity2 with @entity14 's father , @entity93 , who was looking after @entity2 when he was kidnapped by a teenage woman from outside a cafe police announced that they had found @entity2 and his abductor in @entity145 , @entity146 , 50 miles away			1
they had received a tip - off from someone who knew the girl , who was claiming @entity2 was her own			1
they had become suspicious and called the police			0
the girl was arrested and @entity2 was taken to a local police station			1
@entity14 and her father went straight there when they were told			2
@entity14 says : ' @entity2 was actually smiling when he saw us			1
his cheeky little face gave no clue to what he had been through			0
' @entity2 in an early school photo in may 2000 , @entity2 ’s kidnapper was sentenced at @entity164 to 18 months at a young offender ’s institute			1
she claimed to have taken @entity2 because she had suffered a miscarriage and had been too afraid to tell her boyfriend			1
after snatching @entity2 , she had boarded a train to her boyfriend 's mum 's house and pretended @entity2 was hers			1
the judge called her ' a very devious and dishonest young woman '			0
@entity14 says : ' i almost fainted with the relief when she was sentenced			2
' but the young mum 's joy was short - lived as she found she was unable to let @entity2 out of her sight - and even gave up her job to devote herself to his safety			2
@entity14 says : ' i ’d forgiven my dad but i could n’t risk losing my son ever again			2
' my dad turned to drink to cope with the guilt of what he had put us through			0
i told him i did n’t blame him but it was n’t enough - a year later he died of a heart attack , aged 42			0
' i blamed the stress of the kidnapping			0
it was devastating and made my urge to protect @entity2 even more overwhelming			2
' @entity14 snubbed strangers who stopped to coo over her baby and avoided all kinds of social situations			2
and even all these years later , she still can not overcome the terror and kick the habit of guarding her boy - although she does worry that she will end up driving him away			0
she says : ' even @entity2 tells me not to be daft - after all , he 's almost taller than me - but nobody knows the fear of kidnap until they have experienced it			2
' i want the best for my son and worry that i ’ll lose him all over again because of my over-protectiveness			0
' ' @entity2 will now know what i am doing but i have to tell my story			2
i know i need to get help before i push him away			0
' i wish that when he was found it was the end of the story , but it was just the beginning			0
but i ’m determined to control this for the sake of my son			0
' i want people to understand how devastating and traumatic kidnapping can be , even when a child is found			0
' all these years later , @entity14 still ca n't get over the fear of @entity2 being taken away from her all over again , so she stalks him to ensure he is safe			1
