by @entity0 published : 10:26 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 14:51 est , 23 may 2013 his honour judge @entity1 has been criticised by the @entity3 for copying large parts of his ruling from the closing submissions of one side in a £ 1.8m court case a top judge has been reprimanded after he copied almost every word of a ruling which left a father and son ruined by a £ 1.8 million debt			1
judge @entity1 , who earns nearly £ 130,000 - a - year for sitting on the bench , lifted ' word for word ' chunks of one side 's written arguments before condemning entrepreneur , @entity22 , and his elderly father , @entity24 , to a life of penury			1
underlining that ' appearances matter ' , the @entity3 laid into judge @entity29 's plagiarism and warned that such ' thoroughly bad practice ' must never happen again			1
lord justice @entity31 said that ' almost all ' of judge @entity29 's ruling was ' taken word for word ' from written submissions put in by financial brokers , @entity37 , who sued the @entity39 after they lost a fortune gambling on derivatives at the height of the financial crisis			1
dismissing the @entity39 ' appeal today , lord justice @entity31 ruled - ' not without some hesitation ' - that , despite his copying , judge @entity29 , who earns a total of £ 129,579 - a - year , had ' performed his essential judicial role ' and his reasons for ruling against the pair were ' sufficiently apparent '			2
despite ' a number of small verbal changes ' made by the judge , the overall impression was that his decision was ' derived almost entirely ' from @entity37 ' closing submissions			2
the @entity39 ' lawyers had calculated that , when setting out the facts of the case , judge @entity29 had used ' some 94 per cent ' of the words originally drafted by @entity37 ' legal team			1
there was also ' no alteration whatever to the structure '			0
the judge , sitting with sir @entity68 and @entity69 , said : ' in my opinion , it was indeed thoroughly bad practice for the judge to construct his judgment in the way that he did			1
' by adopting @entity37 ' arguments wholesale , judge @entity29 had given the impression that he had not considered the case independently and even - handedly			0
although there was ' nothing inherently wrong ' in making use of such documents , lord justice @entity31 said : ' i have never before seen a case where the entirety of the judgment has been based on one side 's submissions in the way that occurred here '			1
sir @entity68 said the @entity39 said they felt the judge had never properly engaged with their case or fairly considered their defence when it was heard at the @entity94 sitting at the @entity95			0
he added : ' the possibility of something approaching electronic plagiarism is new and it needs to be said and understood that it is unacceptable			0
' even if it reflects no more than the judge 's true thinking , it reflects poorly on the administration of justice ... appearances matter			2
' he concluded : ' i hope that a judgment like this one now before us will not be encountered again '			0
sitting at the @entity3 , @entity31 dismissed the @entity39 ' appeal and said despite his copying , judge @entity29 had ' performed his essential judicial role ' and his reasons for ruling against the pair were ' sufficiently apparent ' those tough words will , however , come as little comfort to the @entity117 - based @entity39 , after the court ruled that , whatever his failings , judge @entity29 had nevertheless reached the right result and the pair could not be let off the hook			1
in his april 2012 ruling , judge @entity29 had said that @entity22 , was ' charmingly frank about his addictive gambling nature and of his sad financial demise '			2
he claimed @entity37 had let him down and the judge observed : ' as he put it , with a humour evocative of @entity129 , " they should not open the bar and give an alcoholic the opportunity to drink more than was good for him "			0
' ' i have never before seen a case where the entirety of the judgment has been based on one side 's submissions in the way that occurred here ' - lord justice @entity31 but judge @entity29 said both he and his elderly father knew what they were getting into when they built up huge positions in financial derivatives known as ' @entity149 ' ( @entity149 )			1
father and son had their accounts compulsorily closed down by @entity37 in february 2009 , within months of the @entity155 collapse , and were left holding debts totalling more than £ 1.8m			0
@entity22 argued that although he operated all the accounts personally , only one of them was his limited risk responsibility			0
he also claimed @entity37 had overestimated his sophistication as an investor and should have limited his losses by closing the accounts sooner			0
@entity24 denied authorising his son to operate an account in his name - he said his signature on a crucial document had been ' forged ' by his son - and both men argued @entity37 had failed to do enough to protect them as consumers			0
however , judge @entity29 - who observed that his ruling would leave father and son ' with little or no assets ' - said the brokers had been under no obligation to give them advice and they were sophisticated enough to understand the risks involved .			2

judge lifted ' word for word ' chunks of one side 's written argument in ruling
