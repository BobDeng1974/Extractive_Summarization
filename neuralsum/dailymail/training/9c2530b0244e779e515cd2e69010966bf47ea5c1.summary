@entity0 's has been accused of ' blatant ' hypocrisy today over plans to demolish a @entity4 war memorial while using an advert honouring the @entity6 to boost @entity8 sales			1
the supermarket giant 's controversial festive commercial features the famous @entity8 truce of 1914 where @entity13 and @entity14 soldiers met in @entity15 to exchange gifts and play football			2
but while working on the advert with the @entity20 the retailer has also been planning to knock down the @entity21 in @entity22 and replace it with a new store			2
anger : @entity0 's has been branded ' hypocritical ' because it plans to remove this @entity22 war memorial while running a @entity8 campaign with the @entity20 all change : the memorial , left , is part of the @entity21 used by @entity30 and @entity22 rugby club until this year the ground is currently home to @entity30 , but was built in 1921 in memory of 300 local rugby players who died in the war			1
campaigners say the supermarket is being ' blatantly hypocritical ' and have accused it of a lack of respect for the historical sports ground			1
@entity0 's insists it will build a new memorial within the new development using stone from the existing pillars and the inscribed gates			1
@entity48 , a campaigner against the new supermarket , said : ' @entity0 's advert is slick , manipulative , artful film making - and also a tawdry , tasteless and inappropriate use of @entity4 sacrifices and memories			1
' the company has long planned and spent thousands preparing to destroy @entity22 's famous war memorial sports ground in @entity22			1
' they are reported to want to go ahead with their plans			0
so , yes , @entity0 's are indeed being blatantly hypocritical			1
' if only they would at least try to understand what the @entity21 is , before they destroy it			0
' ( they ) have failed to grasp a basic fact : that the gates on their own do not constitute the war memorial			0
' nor have they shown any understanding that this sports ground is not any old brown field site , it is a war memorial			1
' nor have they appreciated how utterly disgraceful and tawdry and insulting their plans are			0
' the stands and the dressing room at the @entity21 were built on fields donated by a local businessman			0
it became the home for @entity79 but ownership was passed on to @entity30 in the 1990s			0
vision : the new @entity0 's store in @entity22 will look like this - and the company says that it will contain a new memorial and a memorial square magic moment : a @entity13 and a @entity14 soldier meet in @entity15 on christmas day in the new @entity0 's advert unveiled last week drama : the young @entity90 is deep in thought and then , to shouts of fear and anger from his comrades , decided to climb above ground special : the story of the @entity14 and @entity13 soldiers enjoying a game of football during the @entity4 has become legendary the side , which was relegated from the @entity102 last season , is trying to sell the ground so it can build a new stadium on the outskirts of @entity22			1
but in order to fund the move it needs to sell the @entity21 and @entity0 's obtained planning permission for a new store , homes and community facilities in january 2013			2
the redevelopment will involve demolishing the entire ground , along with the iconic @entity116 which are the scene of a @entity118 every november			0
campaigners insist the entire ground represents a war memorial and are furious that the gates are being dismantled			0
the Â£ 40million project , including the construction of a 4,851 square metre supermarket , also faces opposition because of traffic and noise concerns			0
@entity128 , a director at @entity129 , a group fighting to preserve the ground , added : ' while the nation watches the emotion - packed advert , the days are numbered for @entity22 's largest war memorial			1
' this inspiring and poignant sports - ground tribute to 300 soldier - sportsmen who played the ' @entity137 ' is to be demolished by @entity0 's and replaced by a giant superstore			1
' how can @entity0 's do this in the centenary years of the great war while exploiting the pathos of the @entity8 truce of 1914 ? ' fresh start : the stadium that @entity145 hope to build after they sell the @entity21 to @entity0 's but @entity0 's claims it has acknowledged the importance of the ground and are working on plans to preserve the memorial aspect			1
a spokesman for the supermarket said : ' we absolutely refute we are operating double standards			0
' we recognise that the site has historical importance which is why our plans preserve the memorial stone and also create a public square dedicated to the memory of former @entity22 rugby players			0
' @entity0 's reconstructed the trenches scenes with the help of a war historian to celebrate the supermarket 's 20 years of support for the @entity20 , which runs the annual poppy campaign			2
while some called it moving and brilliant were saying it was a ' cynical ' way for a big business to advertise itself			0
@entity172 added her concerns , saying : ' if there 's anything more tasteless and cynical than the @entity0 's @entity8 advert , i 've yet to see it '			2
@entity178 tweeted : ' the @entity0 's @entity8 advert feels somewhat manipulative ' and @entity179 wrote : ' companies using the the @entity4 as an effort to boost sales is disgusting and disrespectful to the fallen ' .			2
