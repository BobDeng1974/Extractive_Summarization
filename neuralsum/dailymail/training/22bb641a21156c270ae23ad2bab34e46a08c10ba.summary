by @entity0 published : 15:13 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 01:37 est , 11 september 2012 most of us have spent long uncomfortable nights being kept awake by a raucous party at a neighbour 's house or flat			0
but while the majority will have just buried their head under the duvet and shut all the windows , one @entity11 decided to put his inability to sleep to good use and compile a detailed critique of the ' terrible ' karaoke that disturbed him			1
@entity17 then pinned a giant newspaper - style review to the board in the communal area of his @entity23 block of flats and then posted a picture on @entity26			1
scathing review : @entity17 pinned a giant newspaper - style review to the board in the communal area of his @entity23 block of flats and then posted a picture on @entity26 his handmade complaint included timings and titles of songs sung , how it was performed and a rating out of 10			1
after the ' singing / screaming ' finished at 9.10am , his final message to his east @entity11 neighbours was simply : ' i hate you '			2
the 33 - year - old , who works in advertising , wrote to the mystery group who did the ' epic performance ' on a balcony in the middle of the night			0
' your terrace faces 115 windows so you really did have the perfect stage			1
i 'm sure you are keen to hear our verdict , ' he wrote			2
first up was @entity57 , which received a ' terrible ' three out of ten at 2.23am			0
at 3.14am was @entity61 's duet with @entity62 : @entity63 , which mr @entity17 gave a 1 in ten and called ' the lowest point of the performance ' and its chorus was repeated every ten minutes for the rest of the night , he said			1
no stars : @entity17 said the performances of @entity61 's @entity63 and @entity71 's @entity70 were n't good at 8.20am there was @entity71 's balled @entity70 , which was ' actually very good - if you 're going to be woken up after only two hours sleep it might as well be to a herd of morons screaming @entity70 '			1
the finale came at 9.10am with the @entity78 's single friday i 'm in @entity80 , which was a ' return to poor form '			0
quoting its famous first line ' i do n't care if monday 's blue ' mr @entity17 added : ' judging by how wired you all looked by this stage , i can assure you monday through to @entity87 will be very , very blue			2
' @entity17 , after reviewing friday i 'm in love , finished his missive with the words , ' i hate you ' it is not the first time mr @entity17 's creative complaints have captured the imagination			2
three years ago he wrote to sir @entity95 about poor food on his @entity98 flight , which was called the funniest complaint letter of all time			1
he was so furious about his meal between @entity102 and @entity11 he sent six - pages of complaints with pictures of his food			0
he called it his ' culinary journey of hell ' and asked sir @entity95 to consider how he had felt as a child when he opened @entity113 presents , saying : ' it 's your hamster @entity95			0
it 's your hamster in the box and it 's not breathing			0
that 's how i felt when i peeled back the foil			0

@entity17 created a giant complaint letter and pinned it to the board in the communal area of his @entity11 block of flats
it included the names of songs sung , what time it was followed by a mark out of ten and a short critique
' your terrace faces 115 windows . i 'm sure you are keen to hear our verdict , ' he wrote
heir karaoke version of @entity71 's *hit* @entity70 got the most *praise* while @entity61 and @entity62 's @entity63 was the worst
