it is one of the recognisable musical instruments ever made , having featured on songs by everyone from @entity5 to @entity6			1
it is even credited by many as spawning electronic dance music			0
however , one enterprising fan of @entity13 's @entity12 drum machine has decided to make the electronic gadget real - by recreating it using real instruments in his living room			1
the first band to use the @entity12 was the @entity28 electronic music group @entity29 , although it hit the mainstream in 1982 , with the release of the mainstream @entity34 hits ' @entity32 ' by @entity5 and ' @entity35 ' by @entity36			1
it is still used in drum and bass , hip hop , r&b , house , electro , and many forms of electronic dance music			1
the @entity23 , known as the 808 , was one of the first programmable drum machines , and the most recognisable			1
released in 1980 , it has been used in a string of hits in the 1980s by everyone from dance and hip hop bands to @entity52			0
' @entity53 is the first drum robot that reproduces the drum sounds of the 80s - in the real world , ' said @entity19 , who built the machine			1
' i have been playing electronic music for several years now , and at some place i was bored of the electronic music production process			0
' so i decided to go back to the roots of sound generation – the physical sound generation – but combine it with the electronic music structure we like so much			0
' i liked the idea so much , that i could n’t stop building my own drum robots , and ended up replacing all the electronic sounds of a whole drum computer			2
' however , unlike the original , the robot 808 does n't always sound the same , and was designed to sound more ' real '			2
' i like the idea of introducing more ' error ' into the music , ' said @entity19			0
' a drum beaten by a mechanic robot arm can never be as predictable as a computer generated sound			2
' consequently , the mechanic character of the installation @entity53 introduces fallibility into the performance			0
' the cabinet for the project recreates the same key layout at the original , although it can also be programmed form a connected computer			2
eleven sounds of the 808 were replaced by mechanical actuators and physical tone - makers			0
the instruments include : @entity94 , @entity96 drum , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 ( 3x ) and @entity103			1
a gameboy was also used to recreate some electronic sounds			0
motors and solenoids were used as actuators , which are triggered by a power electronic device and an @entity111 computer			0
the clapping sound is created by a series of slats robotic hands play percussion instruments in one of the projects ' segments ' drumsticks are powered by electronic controllers one of the 3d models created to ensure the project would work @entity19 , who built the ' real life ' drum machine			1
