in its zealousness to make amends with veterans whose health needs had been ignored , a @entity6 hospital in @entity7 accidentally reached out to a deceased , @entity10 veteran who passed away two years ago while waiting for care from the @entity6 , a news report revealed yesterday			1
@entity12 , a resident of @entity13 , @entity7 , told @entity14 on monday that her dead husband received a letter in the mail two weeks ago from a local @entity6 informing him it was ready to fulfill the appointment he requested in 2012			1
' i was in complete disbelief , ' she said			0
' it was 22 months too late , i kind of thought i was in the @entity23 when i opened this letter and read it			0
' it took the @entity6 two years to contact the @entity10 veteran pictured here			1
this portrait of @entity26 was provided to @entity14 by his widow @entity30 's husband , @entity29 , died in the summer of 2012 from a brain tumor several months after his wife put in a request to have his care moved from a hospital in @entity36 to a nearby @entity6 in @entity37			1
' it was so difficult for him to take the ambulance ride into @entity36 , ' she told @entity14			0
' we wanted to be closer			0
' but the @entity6 never called , and her husband passed away in august of that year			2
at that time @entity30 says she contacted the government agency and asked it to carry out her husband 's burial			2
the @entity6 reportedly told her it would n't assume the costs because her husband was never treated at a @entity6			2
' it is absurd , ' the @entity7 resident told @entity14			0
' it made me angry because i just do n’t think our veterans should be treated this way			0
' then , two weeks ago , @entity26 received the @entity6 's about her deceased husband 's long overdue doctor 's appointment			1
' i was like you have to be kidding , right , ' she told the news station			0
@entity30 said she tried contacting the @entity61 immediately after opening the letter but never received a response			0
only after @entity14 reported on the tragic misstep did the @entity6 issue attempt to apologize for the tragic misstep			2
' we regret any distress our actions caused to the veteran ’s widow and family , ' a statement from the @entity6 to @entity14 read in part			0
' thank you for bringing this regrettable issue to our attention			0
' the department said it could not legally release details on the @entity26 's case but it confirmed that acting the acting @entity6 director had called @entity12 to apologize for the oversight and left a voicemail when he could n't reach her			2
@entity30 told @entity14 she did not receive a voicemail from anyone at the @entity6 headquarters but an employee of the hospital that made the initial error contacted her			2
@entity12 said she was ' shocked ' when she opened a letter from the @entity6 two weeks that said it was finally ready to see her husband as part of a nationwide apology tour in the wake of an appointment scheduling scandal , the @entity6 is contacting the backlog of veterans who were put on secret waiting lists by @entity6 hospitals trying to cover up long wait times			1
an internal @entity6 audit of 731 medical facilities that was completed last month found that 56,000 veterans seeking care waited more than 90 days for initial appointments at @entity6 hospitals , and more than 10 percent waited more than 30 days , contradicting official reports that showed them waiting on average two weeks to a month			1
a separate report filed by sen. @entity111 last month showed that 1,000 veterans died throughout the last decade as a result of @entity6 mismanagement			1
when veterans died before @entity6 doctors made time to see them , hospital staff would claim that care was ' no longer necessary ' rather than saying that the veteran had passed away , a scheduler for one of the hospitals caught up in the scandal told @entity124 last week			1
' i am hoping if other people speak out , they can improve the system , so no one else dies waiting for an appointment , ' @entity12 told @entity14 yesterday			0
in a report to the president last month acting @entity6 secretary @entity131 said the @entity6 had already reached out to 70,000 veterans to offer them appointments , ' but there is still much more work to be done			1

the @entity6 recently found out @entity6 hospitals were *regularly* lying about how long it was taking for doctors to see vets
it 's now on a crusade to clear the backlog of veterans who need care and has contacted more than 70,000 veterans throughout the last month and a half to schedule appointments
one of the veterans it tried to set up an appointment for died two years ago , showing just how long veterans were waiting for care
