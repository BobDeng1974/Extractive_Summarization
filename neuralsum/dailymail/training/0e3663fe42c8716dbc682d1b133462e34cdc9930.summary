@entity0 decided to quit as @entity2 manager after becoming increasingly dismayed and disillusioned by events behind the scenes			1
friday night ’s @entity6 defeat to @entity7 was a fitting end to a miserable day for the @entity10 club			2
and @entity11 understands @entity0 has had enough following job losses to long - serving staff as part of an ongoing , cost - cutting programme @entity0 watched @entity2 lose 2 - 0 at @entity7 on friday night it ’s thought @entity17 , head of the club ’s youth academy at @entity20 , is set to be the next victim of the cull			1
@entity0 has reached the point where he is willing to give up more than £ 400,000 of the settlement he would be due had he instead been sacked by the @entity10 board			1
the 52 - year - old handed in his notice on thursday but will serve out that 12 - month period unless the directors negotiate a deal over his contract or place him on gardening leave			1
that has effectively created a stand - off with the board as @entity2 are in the grip of a cash crisis — requiring fresh funding in the @entity36 — and can not afford to pay up the terms of his rolling contract			1
@entity2 chief executive @entity40 ( top row centre ) talks to @entity0 before the match by leaving under his own accord , @entity0 is understood to be due 12 months ’ cash			1
he took a 50 - per - cent pay cut to aid the club earlier this year but his severance is based on his original £ 800,000 salary			1
had he been sacked , however , it is believed he would have been eligible for an 18 - month pay - off			1
the dramatic development over his future emerged just hours before @entity2 travelled to @entity53 for last night ’s match			1
@entity0 was in the dugout but for how long will be the question after this latest extraordinary twist in the @entity10 saga			1
he was already under pressure from fans following poor results this season but , as has become the norm at @entity2 , finance will dictate what happens next			1
last night @entity0 repeatedly refused to deny he ’d offered his resignation when quizzed about the day ’s events after the 2 - 0 loss			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 ( right ) was the centre of attention at @entity7 asked if fans deserved clarity , he said : ‘ i think they will probably get some clarity			1
i obviously ca n’t comment myself			2
i think the club will probably comment			0
i would just like to take this opportunity to thank the fans for their support			0
they certainly did n’t get a performance tonight and i ’d like to apologise for that			0
’ he added : ‘ i ’m the @entity2 boss and i ’ll be doing everything to make sure we get back in the fight for promotion			1
i have absolutely no comment on rumours			0
’ pressed on whether the board had approached him upon hearing the reports , he replied : ‘ i ’ve no comment to make on speculation			0
‘ we will be back in tomorrow and i will be acting as if nothing has changed			0
i told them ( the players ) i was the @entity2 manager and i ’d continue to be @entity2 manager			1
’ as for the day of fevered analysis , @entity0 said : ‘ i ’m stating the obvious when i say it ’s not ideal preparation but , in the grand scheme of things , it ’s been an eventful three - and - a - half years , so nothing shocks me any more			1
@entity7 's @entity103 rifles his free - kick into the net to break the deadlock ‘ i would n’t say i ’m angered			2
i was completely focused on the game			0
it ’s my job to manage the team and prepare them — and we did that			2
‘ but i have to say to the @entity2 fans it was absolutely not good enough and there are no excuses			1
‘ you ca n’t make any excuses about speculation			0
it ’s not good enough			0
’ pressed on reports his players were heading for a @entity120 night out tomorrow , @entity0 said : ‘ i would n’t say they are confined to barracks , but they will be in			2
’ rangers are thought to be closing in on a new chief executive and finance director but @entity127 , former @entity128 managing director and ally of @entity130 , is currently playing a significant role in the running of operations			0
that has involved redundancies to a number of staff in recent times as all aspects of the business are analysed			2
@entity0 is thought to have been considering his own position for weeks after feeling increasingly drained by the situation			2
and one source said : ‘ a lot of good people have been leaving @entity10 recently and now it seems @entity147 will go			0
@entity148 fires home to put his side 2 - 0 up against @entity2 ‘ there has been an increasing level of noise around his position and that has deflected attention away from real issues			1
‘ maybe he is thinking that by taking a step back , the spotlight will now shine on the club and the people responsible for its future			0
‘ we all know significant funding is required and the directors will have to provide answers at the agm			0
‘ many people who have @entity2 at heart have been dismissed but the pay of a maintenance man or a groundsman ca n’t come close to the amount of money that has haemorrhaged from this place			2
‘ @entity0 has been dealing with the trauma of good , honest people being sacked as well as keeping the team on track for promotion			2
‘ i ’m sure he is aware his side can be better but it could be said he has done more to keep @entity2 together than anyone else			2
‘ this is not him walking away			0
the club will always be a part of him			0
he might be taking a rest after the most physically and emotionally draining period of his life			0
’ former team - mate @entity192 , a contender to replace @entity0 , said last night : ‘ when the news broke , i was gutted			1
for @entity194 to chuck it in after what he has been through … he ’s not that type			0
‘ something has happened and we do n’t know what			0
if @entity194 was to leave , the legend that he is , it would be a blow			0
everyone talks about dignity , he has been a great figurehead of this club			0

@entity0 has had enough following job losses to long - serving staff
he handed in his notice on thursday and will serve out 12 - month notice
@entity2 boss willing to give up more than £ 400,000 to aid settlement
