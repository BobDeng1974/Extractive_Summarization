new education secretary @entity1 's department says that independent schools must ' actively promote ' @entity4 values independent schools and academies may be forced to drop @entity9 celebrations under rules designed to tackle extremists , critics warned yesterday			1
they say 6,000 private schools will be compelled to adopt political correctness			1
following the @entity16 scandal , in which @entity18 schools came under the sway of @entity21 extremists , the @entity14 proposed that independent schools must ‘ actively promote ’ @entity4 values – said to include respect for legally ‘ protected characteristics ’			1
critics warn the rules will bring a series of unintended consequences , including preventing teachers from using words like husband or wife when discussing marriage ; making teachers inflate the reputation of politicians in their lessons , and dictating the curriculum and exams schools must use			2
they also accuse the @entity39 of setting too tight a timetable when it set up a consultation among schools over the rules			0
responses to the key proposals had to be returned last week – a month before the end of the school holidays and at a time when heads are likely to be on the beach rather than answering @entity51 questionnaires			0
the @entity53 consultation was begun in late june at the height of the @entity16 affair , in which a group of schools in @entity18 were found to have fallen under the sway of @entity21 extremists			2
an inquiry found the schools segregated boys and girls , disparaged @entity4 soldiers , promoted hatred of homosexuals , and taught scepticism about responsibility for the murder of soldier @entity67 and the @entity69 bombings			2
the resulting @entity14 proposals say that independent schools must ‘ actively promote ’ @entity4 values , which are said to include respect for legally ‘ protected characteristics ’ such as homosexuality , religion , gender change , disability , race and marital status			1
they also require improved teaching standards from schools with the lowest levels of attainment			0
the rules will apply to academies and free schools as well as the long - established independent sector			0
a consultation paper reveals this would allow education secretary @entity1 to take ‘ regulatory action ’ in cases such as where girls are ‘ disadvantaged ’ on grounds of gender , ‘ failure to address homophobia ’ , or where prejudice against other faiths is ‘ encouraged or not adequately challenged ’			0
the @entity101 ( @entity102 ) warned this may rule out @entity9 events if other religions ’ festivals are not celebrated to the same degree			0
it also fears teachers may have to avoid the words ‘ husband ’ and ‘ wife ’ when discussing marriage , so as not to discriminate against same - sex couples			1
the @entity102 ’s @entity115 said : ‘ they mistakenly advance the principle that political correctness equal @entity4 values			1
accordingly they could be used to punish any school in the independent sector which has a religious ethos , a set of traditional beliefs , or which does not promote every minority group ’s world view			0
’ @entity128 said @entity9 celebrations in schools and use of words like ‘ husband ’ and ‘ wife ’ in discussions of marriage could be barred under the proposals			1
mr @entity115 added : ‘ under the plans , private schools , academies and free schools would have much less control over their ethos than ordinary state schools			2
there was clearly a managerial problem in the schools in @entity18 , but is forcing more than 6,000 schools and nearly three million pupils to the submit themselves to every whim of the pc brigade really the best way to tackle it ? it makes no sense			2
’ @entity155 , @entity18 was among those in @entity16 operation by @entity21 fundamentalists a reply to the @entity14 from the @entity160 , which represents 1,200 schools , said that forcing schools to accept common standards means they will be ‘ subject to political interference ’ and that the proposals ‘ risk dictating to independent schools which curriculum to follow			1
’ @entity170 ’s objections also say that ‘ there is a major risk of unintended consequences ’ , that standards in high - achieving schools will be forced down , and ‘ time will be wasted considering how schools actively promote these values			1
’ it added : ‘ explicitly requiring schools to encourage respect for the basis on which the law is made in @entity184 comes close to requiring schools actively promote respect for politicians as lawmakers			1
’ the @entity189 , which represents over 18,000 heads and senior staff , said the proposals had been made in undue haste and to such a short timetable that many heads would find out what was happening only after consultation deadlines had passed			0
a submission from the @entity189 said : ‘ this can only undermine respect for democracy and the rule of law as practised in @entity4			0
’ mrs @entity203 now faces a @entity205 judicial review brought by the @entity101 over the attempt to impose the rules on independent schools without giving proper time to listen to their views .			0
