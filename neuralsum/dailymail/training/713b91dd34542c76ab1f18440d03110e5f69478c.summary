@entity1 deal : @entity2 claimed that prices will be £ 94 per year lower than if the government did n't intervene families will pay £ 280 a year in ‘ green taxes ’ by 2020 to fund the shift to wind , solar and nuclear power , ministers admitted yesterday			1
the huge cost faced by ordinary people will pay for the government ’s pledge to cut carbon emissions and be ‘ the greenest ever ’			2
households currently pay £ 89 a year on their bills for the green energy drive , but this will increase every year to reach £ 280 by 2020 , according to the government ’s @entity20 ( @entity20 )			1
the ‘ taxes ’ will provide almost £ 8billion a year towards the £ 200billion cost of vast wind farms , nuclear power stations , a new pylon network , and to put up solar panels			0
but in a bizarre statement , energy and climate change secretary @entity2 told the @entity31 that his policies mean consumers will actually be better off			1
he said : ‘ by 2020 , we expect household bills to be 7 per cent – or £ 94 – lower than they would otherwise be without our policies			0
‘ @entity38 ’s homes will be cheaper to heat and light than if we did nothing			0
’ his claim is based on a controversial assumption that families will make vast reductions in their electricity and gas bills by 2020 – wiping out the £ 280 in green taxes			1
it also assumes there will be a large uptake of government - backed schemes for insulation projects			0
the revelation threatens to spark a revolt from consumers , who are suffering the biggest and longest squeeze on living standards in more than 60 years			0
in addition , chancellor @entity59 is under pressure to over-rule mr @entity2 and halt the rush to green energy in a bid to protect @entity38 industry			1
@entity67 rises : gas bills are set to increase by £ 80 to £ 90 by 2020 regardless of any government intervention the fear is that manufacturers and other businesses will be saddled with huge levies on energy bills , pushing up costs and threatening their ability to sell goods around the world			1
the details were revealed in the small print in @entity20 documents			0
the current average annual energy bill is around £ 1,200			1
@entity20 said the figure would be £ 1,379 by 2020 without any government measures to drive a switch to green and nuclear power			0
it claimed the figure would be £ 1,285 based on the impact of its green taxes and associated policies to cut household energy use and curb wholesale prices			1
however , a @entity20 source admitted this lower figure would be possible only if households slashed electricity use by a third ( from 4.5 to 3 megawatt hours a year ) and gas by 6 per cent			0
the government has a target of providing 20 per cent of the @entity38 ’s electricity from renewable sources by 2020			0
despite the £ 280 price tag of government policies , mr @entity2 insisted rising fossil fuel prices rather than green taxes were to blame for higher energy bills			1
he said : ‘ i want to insulate @entity38 ’s homes not just from the cold weather , but also from the chill winds of global fossil fuel prices			0
it ’s these that are pushing up consumer energy prices			2
‘ we will secure our energy at the lowest cost : in the short term by promoting competition ; in the medium term by insulating our homes and in the long term by steering us away from excessive reliance on fossil fuels and on to clean , green and secure energy			2
’ but dr @entity126 , of the @entity127 , said mr @entity2 ’s reassurances were ‘ political spin ’			1
political spin : dr @entity126 said that the statement that bills will fall was based on guesswork rather than any sound economic facts ‘ all analysis by @entity137 banks and others make clear that current government policy will lead to big increases in energy bills , ’ he said			1
‘ the energy - use reductions being assumed by the government to justify the claim that bills will fall are not based on any sound economic facts			1
’ government policy is based on an assumption that gas prices will continue to rise , but dr @entity126 said the price could fall			1
he said : ‘ prices are likely to come down very significantly , perhaps by 30 to 40 per cent if the @entity143 gives the green light to shale gas exploration			0
the @entity38 is sitting on a gold mine of shale gas			0
’ energy industry expert @entity157 , of @entity158 , said he was ‘ deeply sceptical ’ about mr @entity2 ’s claims of lower bills			1
the @entity161 is particularly fearful of the impact of green taxes			0
chief policy director @entity164 said : ‘ energy intensive industries underpin the @entity38 ’s manufacturing sector , making products as diverse as the steel and chemicals needed for wind turbines and low - rolling resistance tyres			2
‘ the government is in serious danger of throwing out the baby with the bathwater if it continues to pile new costs on to industries			0
’ the government plans to spend £ 11billion installing smart meters in every property , saying that once people see how much energy they use , they will make cutbacks			2
ministers say energy use will also be reduced by the so - called @entity187 , which will allow people to install double - glazing and loft insulation at no upfront cost			2
but a spokesman for consumer group which ? said : ‘ if take - up is lower than expected , energy bills will be pushed up even further			2
