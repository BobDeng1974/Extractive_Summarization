the haunting blog of musician @entity10 detailing his battle with depression and telling his loved ones ' not to be sad i 'm gone ' has appeared online , days after he died it is believed he set up up a delay on the post going live			1
it chronicled the 21 - year - old ’s fight with depression and the stigma attached to it			1
mr @entity10 wrote : ' i ’ve felt nothing towards family members , friends , or otherwise acquainted people , as much as i ’ve felt that i should , like any normal functioning being			1
' no matter how many good things happened to me or the people surrounding me , i did n’t seem to feel any positive emotion at all			2
' the truth is , i ’ve felt suicidal since i was in high school , and told nobody of it until very recently			0
the only comfort to me for the past six to seven years has been knowing that if i do n't get better , if i ca n’t deal with things , or if things become too much for me to cope with , i have a way out			0
' it may seem strange to read , but i guess i saw death as my best pal			1
' nobody is to blame for this , except myself			0
it ’s entirely my own fault , and only my own lack of willpower and strength of mind is to blame			1
my inability to cope with things is the killer here			0

' phone numbers and things are not given to people and if it can raise awareness for one other family , can help somebody and their family and stop them going down the route that @entity10 did - just anything to help			1
' it can stop a family going through what we are going through at the moment			0
' in the blog , found by police , the games store worker talked about his concerns about maintaining friendships , anti-depressants , his use of alcohol , his attempts at finding help and bullying at school , which he said sparked his depression			1

i texted him saying come home and he did			0

' he said " nothing feels like it should "			0
i checked with him every day and he would say he was ok			0

i spoke to him , told him where i was going and that was the last i heard of him			0
' she added : ' open up and talk to anyone - there is help out there			2
there are organisations out there - so many organisations			2
if you are feeling that way there is extra help			0
we want to get the message out there for friends , for family , there is help out there			0
' for that one person , if it helps it is worth it			0
' his body was found by his aunty , @entity152 , 35 , in his bedroom			1
she said : ' i think that is another thing , the fact that it did take him a long , long time to pluck up the courage to speak to a doctor , because there is such a stigma			2
he was such a young lad , it is not something often spoken about and the fact he was on medication and had been referred for counselling , but these things take so long			0
it is believed mr @entity10 timed the post to go online after his death - with the opening line : ' if this post is live i 'm probably not here any more ' ' there is not enough help for them out there			1
' ' it was devastating when i found him			2
the blog made us understand what he was going through - he left a note to the family			2
' it was a shock a week later when the blog was posted , saying why			0
we had no idea to the extent - it was such a surprise			2
' she added : ' he had the best sense of humour ever			0
he was so sarcastic and would wind you up			0
