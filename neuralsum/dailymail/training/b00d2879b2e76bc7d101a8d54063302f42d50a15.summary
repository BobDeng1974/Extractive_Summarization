by @entity0 published : 10:28 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 10:48 est , 4 march 2014 @entity3 black truffles can sell for £ 200 per lb , but chefs in @entity5 have been accused of using @entity7 truffles in their place , which sell for just £ 12 per lb they are notoriously difficult to grow , even more difficult to dig up , and at £ 200 per lb , they are one of the most expensive foods in the world			1
@entity3 black truffles , also known as ' black diamonds ' , are so in - demand that even celebrity chefs have to use them sparingly			1
so it should come as no surprise to learn that unscrupulous eateries are conning consumers by spraying cheap @entity7 varieties with chemicals then passing them off as the real deal			2
@entity25 truffles , which are lighter and much more common than their @entity3 equivalent , can cost as little as £ 12 per lb. because truffles are now so rare and are added to dishes in such tiny amounts it makes the practice easy to get away with , complain trufficulteurs - as the food 's connoisseurs are known			1
the @entity35 of @entity36 ( @entity37 ) is calling for better education on truffle varieties and new legislation on labelling to stop customers being ripped off			0
an investigation by a @entity3 consumer watchdog in 2012 found that between ten and 15 per cent of truffles claiming to be of the exclusive @entity46 variety were actually cheap imports			1
peringord truffles are the second most expensive in the world , after the @entity52 @entity51 variety which can fetch £ 2,300 per lb. the @entity3 fungus , which grows around the roots of oak , hazel and lime trees , used to be more common , but as farmers deserted the countryside for cities and two world wars destroyed the fungi 's natural habitat , they became scarce			1
truffles are difficult to grow and even trickier to find - usually requiring trained sniffer dogs or pigs throughout @entity5 the few truffle farms that still exist produce just 50 tonnes of them annually , with roughly another 25 tonnes imported from @entity7			2
the @entity37 is now introducing a programme to help the 20,000 @entity3 truffle - growers increase production by handing over around £ 200,000 annually to increase production			2
growers themselves have agreed to plant roughly 300,000 to 400,000 trees every year that the fungi are known to grow around , though it can take up to ten years for the new wooded areas to produce the delicacy			0
truffles may be expensive but they are by no means the most expensive food in the world			0
prized beluga caviar , made from the eggs of the beluga sturgeon , sells for around £ 5,000 per lb , and is so valuable that the fish are periodically given ultrasound scans to check how the eggs are doing			0
@entity89 saffron , made from the stoma of crocus flowers , sells for around the same amount			0
it is pricey because it takes a patch of crocuses roughly the size of a football pitch to produce one lb which must all be picked by hand .			0

@entity3 black truffles are a delicacy sell for around £ 200 per lb
@entity7 truffles , by *comparison* , only fetch around £ 12 per lb
chefs in @entity5 have been accused of *duping* customers
watchdog claims @entity7 variety are being passed off as @entity3
