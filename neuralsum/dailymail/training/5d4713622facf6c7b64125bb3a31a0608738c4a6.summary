by @entity1 reporter published : 11:06 est , 5 november 2013 @entity3 : 12:17 est , 5 november 2013 this young @entity4 was n't in the mood to wait for dinner so instead stuck its head down its mother 's gaping mouth to find something to eat			2
the mother bird had already tucked into her tea but the ravenous offspring also wanted a bite			1
these photographs were taken by @entity17 photographer @entity16 , 51 , after he spotted the hungry bird in @entity19 , @entity20			1
dinner for two ? the mother bird enjoys her fishy dinner while her offspring looks on starving : the hungry @entity4 dives straight down its mother 's throat looking for food mr @entity16 said : ' here you can see a young @entity4 trying to get partially digested fish from the parent 's crop			1
' it 's pretty aggressive behaviour as the youngsters push their heads all the way down the parent 's throat			0
' they chase the adult bird and compete with each other to get to the food , so it 's a pretty crazy moment to watch			0
' @entity4 's are found off the coast of @entity17 and @entity44 and will dive for food in both shallow , still water and rapidly moving currents to get their meal			1
@entity49 : the young bird did n't want to wait around for dinner so had a quick look to see if its mother had any grub inside her taking a couple of weeks to get the perfect shot , mr @entity16 said it was difficult to capture the feeding scene			2
' it took me a lot of patience and persistence before i managed to capture this behaviour in front of me in the right distance and angle			0
' i had to get in the pond with water up to my waist , but it was worth it to be able to get these pictures			0
' it usually takes people a little while to look at my photographs before they actually realise what 's going on , and that one bird 's head is right down the other 's throat			0
