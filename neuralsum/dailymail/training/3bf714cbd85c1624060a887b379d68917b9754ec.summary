i saw @entity1 playing for @entity2 against @entity3 at the @entity4 last year			1
when @entity5 signed him , i went back and looked through my notes from that game			1
two words were underlined : great talent			2
@entity11 has the pace , skill and imagination to breathe new life into @entity5			1
make no mistake , this boy can play			2
in that last - 16 game against @entity3 he was overshadowed by a fantastic performance from @entity20 but @entity1 was one of the stars of the tournament			1
@entity1 poses with the @entity5 shirt after joining the club for £ 27million on transfer deadline day @entity11 ( left ) was one of the standout performers at last summer 's @entity4 for @entity2 @entity11 's ( left ) style of play fits in perfectly with manager @entity30 ’s ‘ new ’ @entity5 the @entity2 international 's attacking flair is reminiscent to @entity33 's ( right ) during his @entity34 days the way he goes past people with a quick shimmy reminds me of @entity33			1
he dribbles at pace effortlessly and his spider - like legs seem able to control the ball in the tightest spaces			2
even his hairstyle is similar to the great @entity46			2
he plays with a smile on his face and is the kind of player who gets people out of their seats			2
he fits in perfectly with @entity30 ’s ‘ new ’ @entity5 - a creative winger capable of unlocking the door			1
@entity30 clearly did n’t fancy @entity56 and swapping him for @entity11 shows how far the @entity58 boss has evolved			1
ten years ago , @entity56 would have been the perfect fit for @entity30 ’s title - winning @entity5 side			1
he is a stereotypical @entity64 player - mechanical and efficient - and was excellent as a super-sub at the @entity4			1
but he was too robotic for the new @entity30			2
now @entity30 has a squad bursting with creative talent			2
if @entity56 was a functional part of the engine then @entity11 is the spark to get @entity5 in gear			1
they have looked leggy in recent weeks , particularly against @entity72 after that epic semi-final against @entity74 , and @entity30 will be delighted to have a new face to freshen things up			0
@entity11 replaces @entity56 who was sold to @entity78 side @entity77 for £ 24million @entity56 poses with @entity77 coach @entity79 ( left ) and sporting director @entity80 ( right ) @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 have been exceptional this season , but they play at such a high intensity that they need someone to share the load			1
having @entity11 as another option will help them recharge their batteries			1
@entity30 clearly felt unable to trust @entity56 and @entity92 with that role and they were ruthlessly shipped out last month			0
@entity11 will have to pull his weight			1
@entity30 will drill those defensive responsibilities into him but there will be no worries about his attacking prowess			0
he is just as energetic as the rest of the @entity5 midfield but where @entity81 and @entity83 often cut inside and move across the pitch , the @entity103 loves to go down the line			1
one of his favourite moves is to drive straight at a defender , stop them in their tracks and throw a feint before charging past in the outside lane			0
he is so explosive from a standing start that he knows he has the beating of his man over a short distance			0
sometimes he ’s quite old - fashioned and he ’s not afraid of a bit of push - and - run			0
i ’m sure the late , great sir @entity121 , who retired 50 years ago on friday , would have enjoyed watching him			0
@entity11 's attacking qualities will give @entity5 an added edge as they chase three trophies this season @entity11 's arrival will serve as added competition to @entity82 ( left ) and @entity81 ( centre ) at the @entity128 it will be interesting to see how @entity30 uses @entity11			1
he has the flexibility to play on either side or through the middle , but the most important thing he brings is increased competition for places			0
@entity5 were guilty of complacency last year , and that ’s why they lost the title			1
@entity82 downed tools in readiness for the @entity4 , @entity30 had a pop at hazard for not working hard enough and they lost games you would never expect a @entity30 side to lose - @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			1
with a player of @entity11 ’s quality arriving , there is no way any players will be dropping into their comfort zone			2
internal competition has to be fierce if you want to reach the top and if @entity30 does n’t like you , it wo n’t be long before he cuts you adrift			0
@entity30 has previously talked about some of his players as ‘ untouchable ’			0
he has his favourites now but with @entity11 ’s talent , there might be a few unhappy faces as the fight for places heats up			2
the @entity169 and @entity170 derbies are cracking games but , having played in both , i found a healthier atmosphere in @entity74			0
it felt more like a footballing family			0
rivalry was fierce but there was respect			0
in north @entity169 , after @entity179 moved from @entity180 to @entity181 , it was venomous and hard to believe people could be so aggressive towards 11 players			0
in @entity186 ’s first game back at @entity187 , when our coach was heading up @entity190 , the police were trying to contain the fans			0
there were bottles thrown and the back windows of our coach were smashed			0
but we used that to motivate us			0
every thursday i will answer your questions live on @entity200			0
