by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 07:15 est , 15 august 2013 quids in : @entity2 is £ 5,000 she lost in 2007 was handed in to police when @entity2 ’ handbag , stuffed with £ 5,000 in cash , went missing she reported it to the police			1
but she soon gave up hope that the bag – or the money - would ever be found			1
now the bag has been found exactly where she had forgotten she left it , on a peg in a church in @entity14 , six years after she reported it missing			1
and even more miraculously , all the money was still there			1
the 47 - year - old said : ' i feel so stupid			0
i must have left it in the church but obviously i did n’t realise that , and i reported it stolen to the police			1
' i thought it had been stolen from my home			1
it is crazy that i have got the money back after all this time			2
' i ca n’t believe that it ’s just been hanging on the same peg where i left it in the same holdall with my bank cash card in it , exactly where i must have left it			1
' it is an amazing story but i feel embarrassed			0
i used to go into a lot of churches in @entity40 to pray at the time and i do n’t even know which one found it			2
' i would like to know so that i can give a donation to church funds to thank them			2
' @entity47 - born mrs @entity2 had been on her way to the bank to change the money into dollars ahead of a trip back to her place of birth in 2007 , when she had popped into a church and absentmindedly left it there			1
puzzled police in @entity40 have described its sudden and unexpected reappearance as ' @entity42 '			0
the money was so old that the notes were out - of - date and had to be replaced by the @entity61			2
@entity40 pc @entity62 said : ' the church could n’t say how long it had been there before they looked inside and found all these bundles of £ 20 notes			1
' a very nice lady from the church came and handed it in to @entity40 police station			2
' we did some research and discovered that it had been reported stolen in 2007 from a @entity40 home			1
' in all my experience as a policeman this is a one in a million			0
a cash card was still with it and that ’s how we traced it back			2
honest : the money was found at a church in the quaint @entity14 town of @entity40 ' the people at the church are very modest about what they did in returning it and do n’t want any publicity			1
' the owner wanted to thank them for their honesty but they want to remain anonymous			0
' mrs @entity2 hit the headlines in 2009 for another case of forgetfulness when she left her keys in her car and a thief stole it			0
what he did not realise was her 9st dog - a @entity103 , @entity105 cross called @entity106 - was dozing peacefully on the back seat			0
when the giant hound woke up , the terrified thief ran off with his tail between his legs			0
at the time @entity2 ’s husband @entity112 , 41 , said : ' i ’d love to have seen the look on his face when he saw @entity116 in the mirror			0
' he must have got the shock of his life			0
there ’s no alarm on the car but who needs one when you ’ve got the @entity125 on your back seat ? ' speaking about the latest incident , mr @entity127 said the £ 5,000 would come in handy as the couple were planning to build a series of five star eco lodges on former @entity134 land at a local beauty spot of @entity136			1
he added : ' it ’s fantastic that this money has come to light now			0
it could n’t have come at a better time			0
