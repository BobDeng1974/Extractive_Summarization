by @entity0 published : 14:15 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 15:14 est , 14 november 2013 locked up : @entity1 on the day he was jailed for 11 years in december 2012 for the indecent assault of a number of his female patients seven victims of a gp who subjected vulnerable patients to degrading sexual abuse in his surgery were today stripped of their compensation payouts by appeal judges			1
the women had been awarded cash sums totalling £ 38,500 from their abuser , 71 - year - old dr @entity18 , from @entity19 , following his conviction last year			1
@entity1 was jailed for 11 years in december after he was found guilty at @entity21 of numerous counts of indecent assault against the victims , six of whom were patients			1
but he appealed and today saw the compensation orders quashed by top judges , @entity29 , mr @entity30 and judge @entity31 , at the @entity32			2
lord @entity29 said no evidence had been put before the crown court on which the judge could reliably say the women had been mentally damaged by the abuse			1
he said : ' looking at the evidence overall , the judge was not in a position to make a finding that substantial psychological problems had been caused by the appellant ’s conduct			1
' ' this could only properly be established by the appropriate psychiatric evidence and other inquiries			0
' we do n’t think the judge was entitled to form his own judgment on issues such as these			2
' this necessitated careful and expert psychiatric assessment , based on interviews and discreet investigation and inquiry			0
it was not capable of assessment by a trial judge in the context of a court assessment			2
' the court heard @entity1 was the sole gp at a surgery in @entity65 , near @entity19 , when he took advantage of some of those who came to see him for help in the 1970s , 1980s and 1990s			0
he questioned them on their sex lives , performed unnecessary intimate examinations and , in one case , put his penis into a patient ’s mouth and called her a hypochondriac			1
sick : over three decades dr @entity1 assaulted several patients , he questioned them on their sex lives , performed unnecessary intimate examinations and , in one case , put his penis into a patient ¿ s mouth and called her a hypochondriac another of the victims became so accustomed to being unnecessarily examined that she automatically took off her top during a routine visit to another doctor later in her life			1
the one victim who was not a patient told how he had suggested that they have an affair and then put his hand up her skirt			2
the crown court judge , judge @entity100 , said it was the worst case of its kind by a professional man which he had seen during his career in law			1
he said expert evidence was not required to know that the victims had suffered psychological trauma , which justified the compensation awards			0
three women received £ 10,000 each from @entity1 and another got £ 5,000 , while the remaining three got £ 1,500 , £ 1,000 and £ 750			2
but @entity113 said the judge should not have made the awards , he said : ' we do feel constrained to say that the judge erred in this regard			0
' ' we have great sympathy for the complainants - even the judge said himself how sympathetic he was to them			0
' but we do not think this should permit departing from well - established principles relating to compensation orders , in particular the need for a sound evidential basis for making appropriate findings			0
' @entity1 , who watched proceedings via a video link from prison , was not so lucky in his appeal against the 11 - year sentence , which the judges said was tough , but not overly so			0
ruling to uphold the sentence the judge said : ' whilst this sentence was , particularly given the strong mitigation , a severe one , and perhaps even a very severe one , we are not able to say that it was manifestly excessive			0
