high cost of going green : @entity4 's green energy ' folly ' will cost every family an extra £ 600 a year by 2020 , a report warned last night @entity4 's green energy ‘ folly ’ will cost every family an extra £ 600 a year by 2020 , a report warned last night			1
the cost to consumers of green energy subsidies will exceed £ 16billion a year within seven years , according to a leading industry analyst			1
dr @entity13 , director of the @entity14 , warned that the huge burden on taxpayers could lead to the first long - term decline in living standards since the @entity19			1
he estimates that a third of the £ 600 annual cost will land on energy bills			1
the rest will be borne by businesses who will pass on the costs to consumers by charging higher prices for their goods			2
in a report titled @entity31 ? , he said : ‘ shifting to current renewables for the bulk of our energy would result in a reversal of the long - run economic trend since the @entity19			1
' more people would be working for lower wages in the energy sector , energy costs would rise , the economy would stagnate and there would also be a significant decline in people ’s standard of living			1
’ he added : ‘ the annual additional cost to consumers will be upwards of £ 16billion a year in 2020 , which is over 1 per cent of current gdp			1
‘ one third of this cost would hit households directly through their electricity bills , regardless of income , making it an intensely regressive measure			1
‘ the remainder of the cost would be passed through from industrial and commercial customers and eventually be met by households from increases in the cost of living			1
the total impact would be in the order of £ 600 per household per year , assuming there are 26million households			2
’ under @entity71 laws , @entity4 ’s energy consumption from renewables needs to reach 15 per cent by 2020 – one of the largest proportional increases in @entity74			2
it is currently around 6 per cent			0
dr @entity13 said the @entity77 – the amount customers pay on their fuel bills to fund green energy – currently costs consumers £ 2billion a year			0
this will have to rise to almost £ 8billion to meet the targets , he said – costing an average family some £ 200 extra a year			0
the @entity87 policy , which is a charge on businesses for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit , will cost an additional £ 1billion			2
experts say this will make @entity4 ’s firms uncompetitive and force them to pass on costs to consumers			0
additional charges to help fund wind farms are likely to add around £ 5billion a year , the report claims			0
wind turbines stand close by @entity101 : under @entity71 laws , @entity4 ¿ s energy consumption from renewables needs to reach 15 per cent by 2020 - one of the largest proportional increases in @entity74 @entity106 , chief executive of the @entity107 ’ @entity108 , said : ‘ with many families struggling to make ends meet in these tough economic times , taxpayers will be disgusted at how much of their cash is subsidising green energy			2
‘ millions of people are worried about the cost of living , yet the government ’s own policies are making bills even more expensive for households up and down the country			1
‘ ministers should be looking to reduce the burdens they are placing on people by scrapping expensive green taxes and subsidies which are unnecessarily pushing up our energy bills			0
’ last night a @entity130 spokesman said : ‘ we do n’t recognise these numbers			0
the costs of renewables are coming down			0
‘ we ’ve already cut the subsidies for onshore wind and solar and in future all green technologies will have to compete to deliver the best bang for the buck			0
‘ renewable energy is helping support growth through jobs and investment			0
