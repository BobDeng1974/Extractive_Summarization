the reputation of music festivals as exhausting , if not exhilarating , events got a shake up this week as @entity4 announced it 's plan for an over- 30 's ' comfort zone ' for weary revelers			1
while festivals might traditionally be associated with long days in the baking sun fueled by energy drinks and caffeine , this year 's @entity4 will cater to its older demographic , providing must - needed respite in the form of bean bags , chilled beverages , and even remedial massage			1
in a move which sounds more in line with a red carpet than a moshpit , festival creator and promoter @entity23 announced the comfort zone after one of his @entity27 followers suggested an ' oldies lounge ' as a place to rest her legs			1
' in the @entity33 and in @entity34 most of the festivals have a two - day format , where people camp and if it all gets too much they can go and rest , ' @entity31 told @entity38			1
@entity4 announced it 's plan this week for an over- 30 's ' comfort zone ' for weary revelers @entity23 announced the comfort zone after one of his @entity27 followers suggested an ' oldies lounge ' as a place to rest her legs ' now that @entity4 has moved to two days , holding the festival in an urban environment made people concerned about handling two days of action without respite , ' he said			1
with reports of brawling at last years @entity53 , deaths on the way to @entity56 over @entity57 , and heightened concern over recreational drug use , many one - day festivals have seen ticket sales plummet			2
when @entity27 user @entity61 , a mother and music lover , suggested an ' oldies lounge ( shaded area with seats ) ' along with ' proof of age for entry ' @entity31 jumped on the idea as a solution that would perfectly fit the direction he wanted the festival to move in			1
' when she suggested it , it was a lightbulb moment			0
i just thought , let 's do this			0
let 's create a really great space where people can get their breath back , grab a quality coffee or gelato , sit on bean bags and have all the comforts of home , ' he said			1
' things have happened really quickly , but we 've already had so many things fall into place			0
' this year 's @entity4 will cater to its older demographic , providing must - needed respite in the form of bean bags , chilled beverages , and even remedial massage many of the performing for decades , and @entity27 user @entity61 said that many fans would be in the older age range @entity102 , 43 , performing in 2011 at the @entity103 to a packed moshpit the comfort zone is all set to have a massage therapist , a gelato bar , and a fine wine tasting bar , which @entity31 is hoping ' to serve in glassware '			1
' it 's going to be really civilised , i 'm taking this very personally			0
i want people to feel like they 're at home , ' he said			0
despite announcing the zone as initially for over 35 's , and then for over 30 's , @entity31 said the zone will only be restricted for those under 18			2
' we do n't want the space filling up with teenagers , but we 're not going to enforce the age apart from that , ' he said			0
' a lot of people these days spend more time inside and just are n't used to a full day outside , and so this is also another way for us to adapt to our demographic			2
' @entity61 , who first suggested the idea and attends the festival with her partner , said that it came as a welcome surprise that her suggestion had been taken seriously			0
' it 's a full on day , and in previous years our bodies have been knackered afterwards			0
@entity4 is definitely an all - ages event , and @entity137 has been playing for almost 50 years so it stands to reason that there are a lot of older fans , ' @entity61 said			1
@entity141 , 42 , and @entity142 , 42 , of punk band @entity143 , performing in 2012 the 2015 @entity4 was announced as a two - day festival , concerning some music lovers @entity4 is definitely an all - ages event , and @entity137 has been playing for almost 50 years so it stands to reason that there are a lot of older fans , ' @entity61 said ' they probably have fans who would love to come , but physically do n't think they 're up to a full day on their feet in the sun , ' she said			1
@entity61 said that reports of brawls can often hurt the reputation of music festivals , which seem like they are ' for the young ' and can put people off attending			0
the move was met with delight by many who had bought tickets to the @entity164 festival , who suggested many of the ideas that have now been introduced to the zone			1
' works for me i 'm 51 , act like i 'm 21 , with a sometimes a body of a 70 year old ... throw in a masseuse and i 'm in , ' said one @entity27 user			2
at least one @entity27 user was already clamboring to buy tickets for the ' reverse daycare but with amenities '			2
' it 's been years since i 've done a festival without considering a nap , i 'm only 30 now			0
' while no official pricing has been set , a preliminary estimate of $ 15 to $ 20 for tickets for the comfort zone was floated by @entity31 , who will be holding a planning meeting on monday which he will live tweet despite announcing the zone as initially for over 35 's , and then for over 30 's , @entity31 said the zone will only be restricted for those under 18 @entity61 said that while she always enjoys @entity190 , which she calls ' the highlight of her music year ' , and has found the festival to be well - run , clean , and friendly , she was glad to have somewhere to sit down and rest out of the sun. ' i would have been happy with shade and seats			1
but a dedicated bar , tables to eat at , an upmarket toilet are all good			0
and if someone wants to massage us while we 're there , we 'll they 're more than welcome , ' @entity61 said			0

' at the end of the day we want people to get the most out of their experience			0
it 's a pretty hectic day and that 's another reason for people to have an oasis to run away to , ' he said			2
