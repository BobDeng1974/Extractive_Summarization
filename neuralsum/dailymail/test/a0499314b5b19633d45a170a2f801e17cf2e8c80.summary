a young @entity4 fan , who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies ’ creator @entity0 asking whether he would allow @entity1 to marry in the future , was elated to receive a reply granting his request			1
seven - year - old @entity9 , an aspiring @entity10 , was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry , as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead @entity10 to the ' dark side '			1
desperate for a solution , @entity18 , who has autism , went directly to the man in charge : @entity4 director and writer mr @entity0			1
plea by post : seven - year - old aspiring @entity18 sent a letter to @entity0 asking him to change the rule that bans the @entity1 from marrying as character @entity28 's marriage to princess @entity29 led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent @entity32 , @entity33 wanted to avoid the same fate , and pleaded with the @entity4 creator to make a change to the rules			1
' with @entity33 , he was obsessing about it , ' @entity18 's mother @entity38 told @entity40 : ' finally , i was like , you know what , write to @entity0 and tell him how you feel and that 's all that you can do			1
' ' dear @entity0 , ' @entity18 wrote in his letter			1
' i do n't like that a @entity10 can not get married			1
i want to get married without becoming a sith			0
' p.s. i want to come to @entity48 please , @entity49			0
' soon enough , a package from @entity51 arrived for @entity18 in the mail , and his mother @entity53 was on hand to film him opening it up			0
the letter : @entity18 , desperate not to end up like @entity28 - aka @entity33 - in the film series , made his case to the @entity4 creator the big reveal : @entity18 's mother filmed her son 's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of @entity4 merchandise in the video , @entity18 is ecstatic to find a stash of @entity4 goodies in the bag , including books and toys , accompanied by a letter addressing his question			2
' it sounds like the @entity76 is strong with you , and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question , ' it said			0
' to be a @entity10 is to truly know the value of friendship , of compassion , and of loyalty , and these are values important in a marriage			2
the @entity32 think inward , only of themselves			0
' when you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way , then you are on the path of the light , and the dark side will not take hold of you			1
with this goodness in your heart , you can be married			0
' the letter was signed ' your friends at @entity51 '			2
' @entity76 is strong with me ! ' : @entity18 is elated to have his question answered quite the response : @entity51 sent this letter to seven - year - old @entity18 to ease his mind about one day being able to get married in the video showing @entity18 reading the letter for the first time , the young fan is delighted to say the least , exclaiming : ' i can get married ? no way ! ' according to @entity18 's mother , the obsession with @entity4 has been a godsend for her son , who , as a result of his autism , struggles to share his emotions			2
' a lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire @entity120 has helped us that way , ' she told @entity40			0
' it ’s very black and white			0
there ’s a dark side and good side			1
' it helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions			0
there is a conception that some autistic kids do n’t have emotions , but they do			2
it ’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it			0

*traditional* @entity10 rules forbid any *knights* from marrying because it is thought it will lead them to the *‘* dark side ’
@entity9 , from @entity146 , was therefore *concerned* that if he became a @entity10 , he would n’t be able to find a wife
the aspiring @entity10 , who has autism , penned a letter to @entity0 to see if he would consider changing the rules
