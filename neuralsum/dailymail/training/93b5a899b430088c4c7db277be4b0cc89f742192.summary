by @entity0 published : 04:21 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 9 september 2013 the 28ft structure in place in @entity3 , @entity4 , which was put on display for less than a month it was intended as a lasting memorial to the @entity8 killed in the september 11 attacks on @entity11 ’s @entity10			1
but the sculpture , named ‘ after 9/11 ’ and made of a twisted girder pulled from @entity13 itself , was left to rust in a farmyard for nearly two years because bureaucrats refused to find it a permanent site			2
@entity4 received the relic of the @entity10 after @entity8 declared it would stand shoulder - to - shoulder with @entity23 in its hour of need			1
sixty - seven @entity8 were among the 3,000 killed on 9/11			1
@entity4 mayor @entity26 , who originally unveiled the piece in @entity3 in 2011 , has now been forced to act and yesterday announced that he had found a permanent home for it in the @entity30			1
the 28ft sculpture , designed by @entity33 - @entity23 artist @entity32 , was put on display for just 28 days before being pulled down and left under a tarpaulin on the farm in @entity37 , @entity38			1
planning permission had been granted for it be installed in @entity40 , by @entity41			0
but the park ’s private owners refused to accept it , saying the size was ‘ inappropriate ’ and citing ‘ local opposition ’			0
and when applications to all of @entity4 ’s boroughs for a site were refused or ignored , the sculpture was sent to the farm for storage			1
it has recently been moved to a storage depot in @entity55 , north west @entity4			1
former @entity11 fire commissioner @entity56 , who led the 9/11 rescue effort , said : ‘ those responsible for deciding who they gave this steel to would be very upset			0
‘ it is confusing and very disappointing to think of it being kept in storage somewhere			2
miss @entity32 said she wanted to ' give light back into the community ' with her work , which will be moved from @entity3 to a permanent home as soon as a suitable location is found			0
' i thought it was a poetic way to express transformation , ' she said			0
' not only are we having the piece stand upright in a gesture of resilience , but to create something serene and light			0
' @entity91 was given to put the structure up permanently at @entity40 near @entity93 , but then the land 's management trust blocked it , according to the @entity96 @entity97 , mother of @entity98 who died in the disaster , said : ' it 's sad no one seems to want it anywhere			2
it should be put up in central @entity4 where everyone can see it			1
' the mayor of london @entity26 said : ' we backed the 9/11 project when the sculpture first came to @entity3 , but finding a permanent home for it has proved incredibly difficult , whether it be opposition from @entity112 or bureaucrats			2
' clearly this ca n’t continue			0
as a result i 've asked my team to find a permanent home for the sculpture on the @entity30			2
' the park was home to a games based on tolerance , harmony and respect , and will soon be home to a massive multi-dimensional and vibrant community - the perfect riposte to those who sought to divide the world on 9/11			0
' there has also been anger from mr @entity56 who described the situation as ' confusing and disappointing ... to think of it still being in storage			0
' he added : ' those responsible for deciding who they gave this steel to would be very upset			0
' a memorial museum has been set up at @entity13 near the site of the new @entity10 in @entity11 visitors to the @entity147 september 11 @entity146 peak into the museum ahead of the 12th anniversary of the attacks @entity151 forsytheboyde @entity153 @entity152 @entity154 @entity162 c @entity161 @entity160 @entity159 @entity158 @entity157 @entity156 @entity155			1

girders shipped to @entity8 for tenth anniversary went on display *briefly*
*charity* raised £ 250,000 for structure and hoped to put in central @entity4
however , it was discovered in a farmyard and is now in storage in @entity55
@entity8 was one of only a *handful* of countries to receive @entity10 *fragments*
@entity26 today said he was looking to put it in the @entity30
