by @entity0 , business correspondent families who live in rented homes are spending on average £ 124 a month more than those who own their properties , a report revealed			2
the cost of paying off a mortgage has never been lower due to rock - bottom interest rates.in 2008 , a typical family spent £ 945 a month on a mortgage for a three - bedroom house and other buying costs such as insurance and maintenance			1
a family who were renting a similar property in the same area were spending only £ 719			1
homes for sale : rock - bottom interest rates mean that it costs £ 124 a month more to rent than homeowners pay on their mortgage but the tide has turned against tenants over the past six years			2
the family who are renting are now paying a record high of £ 769 a month , and the family who own their home are spending only £ 645 a month on their mortgage			1
the calculation is based on a typical family with a 27 per cent deposit on the property and a £ 126,000 mortgage			1
the situation has never been worse for tenants , as there is not a single region where a family who rents is better off than one who owns , according to the report compiled by banking giant @entity43			0
while mortgages are at their cheapest rates ever , the gap highlights the nightmare facing families who want to buy but can not afford the huge deposits needed to get on to the property ladder in the first place			0
buy buy buy : if you can afford it , with rock bottom interest rates it is better to purchase a home than rent as you would expect , the biggest gap between renters and owners is in @entity62 – where a mortgage for a typical three - bedroom house is £ 1,196 per month , while a tenant is spending £ 188 more			1
in @entity67 and @entity68 , the average house price has reached an all - time record of nearly £ 260,000 , according to estate agent @entity70 – nearly ten times higher than the typical full - time worker ’s salary of £ 27,000			1
the report comes as official figures show the number of homeowners has dropped to its lowest since 1987			0
latest figures show 65.2 per cent of households in @entity67 are classed as ‘ owner occupiers ’			0
the number of homeowners has continued to fall for the last eight years , according to the @entity83 ’s latest @entity82			0
industry predictions are that the proportion will only get lower – and could eventually drop below 50 per cent			0
property buyers have been helped by the @entity67 ’s decision to cut the base rate of interest to 0.5 per cent , the lowest in its 320 - year history , which dramatically cut the cost of a mortgage			2
however , with the first increase widely expected to take place next spring , mortgage holders may not be better off than renters for long .			0

biggest gap between mortgage payment and rent is in @entity62
average house price reaches all - time high in @entity67 and @entity68
nowhere are renters paying less than those who own their home
in 2008 a typical family spent £ 945 a month on a mortgage , now their outlay is £ 645 , down almost 32 per cent
at that time renters paid £ 719 and now have to find an extra £ 50 , nearly 7 per cent more
