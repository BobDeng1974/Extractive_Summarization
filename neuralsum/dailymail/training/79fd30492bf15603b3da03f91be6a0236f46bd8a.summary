one of the teachers of slain schoolboy @entity1 - the 15 - year - old who was shot twice in the head for asking another male student to be his @entity6 - has created shock and anger among activists for saying that she ' relates ' to @entity1 's killer			1
the claims were made last night in @entity14 's powerful new documentary @entity12 , which aired on @entity15 and follows the dual stories of @entity1 - a flamboyant @entity17 with transgender issues , who would wear make - up and dresses - and @entity22 , a 14 - year - old from a troubled white home with a budding interest in no - @entity26			1
the day after @entity1 asked @entity27 to be his @entity28 , @entity27 walked into their school in @entity31 , a small farming town in @entity32 , loaded with a pistol and murdered @entity1 in a computer lab. @entity14 's documentary was spawned by how little attention the case received and the overhelming amount of support that @entity40 recieved and not @entity1 , the victim			1
' they made a murder victim the cause of his own murder , ' said @entity47 detective @entity46			2
' i 've never seen that before			0
a standout section of the documentary that has drawn the ire of gay activists is an interview with @entity51 , @entity1 's seventh grade teacher at @entity71			1
@entity1 had confided in her about his gay tendencies and she told him to keeep them ' private ' and to ' dwell ' on them			2
' i do believe in a heaven and a hell , and i do believe @entity22 honestly did not have a clue , honestly , the consequences of his actions , ' @entity51 said			1
' i relate to @entity27 because i could see my own self being in that very same position			2
' i do n't know if i would have taken a gun , but a good swift kick in the butt might work really well , ' she added , laughing			0
perspective : juror @entity89 says murderer @entity27 was being ' taunted ' by @entity1 and that killing @entity1 was a ' plan to take care of this terrible problem ' there were also interviews with some of the jurors involved in the case who spoke in support of @entity40			1
juror @entity89 , a nurse , said it was a breach of civil rights because @entity27 was being ' taunted '			2
' where are the civil rights of the one being taunted by another person that is cross-dressing ? ' she said			0
' they have to address that			0
he had no one to turn to because the school was soi pro @entity22 's civil rights but where was @entity27 's civil rights ? ' @entity89 said if @entity1 had followed the ' example ' lead by a lesbian student , who stopped holding the hands of her girlfriend at school , he would not have been killed			1
' ( @entity40 ) had a plan to take care of this terrible problem because no one else was , ' she said			1
juror @entity125 described the teen as ' intelligent ' and that his drawings of @entity129 symbols were normal			0
' that 's what kids do , they doodle , ' she said			0
@entity14 set out to challenge views such as this			0
' as a community , i think we ’re really failing our @entity139 youth of color , ' she said			0
' it ’s time for us to understand where race intersects with @entity139			0

@entity1 , known as @entity22 , was 15 when he was shot twice in the head at school by @entity27 , 14 , who @entity1 asked to be his @entity28
*emotional* new documentary tells the story of how a small town rallied behind @entity27 , naming him the victim
teacher @entity51 , one of @entity1 's confidante 's , says she ' could see herself in the same position '
juror says @entity27 was solving a ' terrible problem ' because @entity1 was a cross-dresser
