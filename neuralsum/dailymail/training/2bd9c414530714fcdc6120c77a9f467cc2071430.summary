a very welcome antidote to another rainy day at @entity2 , @entity0 kicked off day two with a lesson in how to dress a woman			2
the designer , who believes fashion has become ' rather shapeless ' lately , was on a mission to flatter the female form and his @entity13 collection of silhouette dresses , cashmere coats with relaxed shoulders and shrunken jackets did just that			1
speaking about the @entity0 woman , the designer told @entity17 : ' she is female as opposed to feminine , she 's curved , she 's got feminine attributes ; she 's unashamedly that			1
' it 's wearable clothes for powerful women with a lot of sexiness			1
' powerful but sexy : @entity0 kicked off day two of @entity2 at the @entity25 this morning with his undeniably feminine @entity13 collection jet black , silk - lined dresses with sexy cutaway backs , sculpted dresses in pared back tones and buttery leather jackets were the order of the day at the @entity25			1
@entity35 's aim was to create an easy and wearable collection , ' you can wear it to the office and then out at night			1
you can put the jacket over the top of the sequin dress to cover up and then take it off when you hit the town , ' he explained			2
@entity44 hot : an otherwise pared back collection of buttery soft jackets and sequin dresses was brightened up with a jolt of geranium red it 's all about the coats : edge - to - edge coats were the stars of the catwalk and they came in the omnipresent sugar spun pink edge - to - edge coats were the stars of the catwalk and they came in black , grey , blonde and sugar spun pink with instinctively belted waists			1
' it 's the idea of being able to slip them off , it 's the idea of dressing up - there 's a comfort juxtaposed against that sort of saucy underneath piece			0
it 's all about confidence on top and hotness underneath , ' he said			0
double - faced cashmere , delicately soft leathers and silk tule dresses with a ' quadruple stretch ' reigned supreme - but the forceful jolts of geranium red were what took the audience by surprise amidst an otherwise neutral pallete			1
' i thought , well , we need some orange here			0
but i would call it reddish orange - it is a particularly good colour , ' said @entity91			1
desk to dancefloor : @entity35 's main aim was to create a wearable collection with a lot of sexiness adding some shape : @entity91 believes that fashion has gone slightly shapeless lately and his mission is to emphasise the female form accessories were kept to a minimum with just one envelope bag and a mid-high heel because ' if i was a women i would want that , it 's as simple as that , ' according to the man himself			1
front row regular @entity112 was most impressed with what she witnessed this morning			1
speaking about the collection , she said : ' it was vintage @entity35			0
i loved that little navy cashmere sweater and that navy striped skirt			0
i think it would sell extremely well and the coats were great			0
' the bra dress with a swingback jacket in orange was lovely ; the whole collection was very easy			2
' man of the moment : @entity91 stepped out to loud applause at the end of his show this morning family matters : @entity132 , along with @entity91 's entire family , held fort on the front row at his show today @entity138 keyhole tunic dress , £ 65 , navy flared dress , £ 65 , navy speckled tunic top , £ 55 , all j by @entity0 at @entity142 he 's been around so long , he 's practically part of the furniture but on this showing , it seems unlikely that @entity147 will ever get bored of @entity148			1
his razor - sharp grasp of technical detail and gloriously romantic vision were once again in evidence , with his signature ruffles and judicious use of colour drawing appreciative gasps from the watching fashion pack			2
intricate : with his razor - sharp grasp of technical detail and gloriously romantic vision , how could we ever tire of @entity148 ? @entity162 appeared in the form of applique flowers that bloomed across bodices and trailed gently down skirts , while dresses that could have been dull were given a shot in the arm with eye - catching rosettes and sculpted hemlines			0
lovely though they were , the highlight was surely a stunning tiered crimson cocktail dress , styled with a matching hat , that blazed a feather - like trail down the body			0
texture : dresses that could have been dull were given a shot in the arm with eye - catching rosettes , sculpted hemlines and a whole lot of texture other high points in the dress heavy show included a delicate feathered dress and a spectacular ruffled skirt suit in steel grey			0
while the colours were muted , with black , grey and crimson reigning supreme , the textured silhouettes more than made up for it			0
with daughter @entity196 showing later on this week , @entity148 proved , once again , that while there might be two designers named @entity148 , neither are to be missed			0
as for beauty , nail supremo @entity199 layered @entity201 with @entity202 and topping it off with @entity203 about you			0
man of the hour : designer @entity148 ( r ) celebrates at the end of his show today at @entity208			2
