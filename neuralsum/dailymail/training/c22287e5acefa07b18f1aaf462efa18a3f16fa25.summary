@entity0 is hoping to be granted @entity2 citizenship this week , and has his sights set on representing his adopted country at the @entity5 in march			1
it emerged last year that the @entity7 , who has lived in @entity9 since 2008 , was intending to switch nationalities			1
but his hopes of playing @entity5 for @entity9 appeared to have been scuppered by a change in the rules to prevent players representing two different countries that came into force at the start of 2015			1
@entity0 is hoping to be granted @entity2 citizenship this week ahead of the @entity5 in march @entity0 had not expected to complete the citizenship process until next month but he rushed through it and sent off all his paperwork in time			1
provided the 25 - year - old , who is through to the second round of the @entity25 , is successful in his application , he would be eligible for @entity9 's @entity28 first - round match against the @entity29 in @entity30 in march			1
@entity0 said : ' i gave all the papers to the @entity33 and i 'm waiting for their response			2
it 's quite an exciting period for me now			0
' although i 'm at the tournament and i do n't want to think too much about this , it would be really nice to get approval from the @entity33 that i can be a citizen of the @entity2			2
if @entity42 is successful , he would become @entity2 number three behind @entity44 ( above ) and @entity45 ' my solicitor is taking care of it and it should be in the next couple of days i think			1
' i had to rush with the life in the @entity2 test and @entity52 exam because of the new @entity55 rules but i 'm still positive , i think it will be all right			2
' with a ranking of 156 , @entity42 would become the @entity2 number three behind @entity44 and @entity45			2
but he has been ranked as highly as 71 and his current standing is a reflection of 18 months of injury problems			0
the option of selecting @entity0 would be a welcome one for @entity5 captain @entity64 , who has long bemoaned the lack of strength in depth available to him			1
@entity5 captain @entity64 ( left ) would certainly welcome the addition of @entity42 to his playing roster but the @entity72 will be aware it is a divisive issue and , given @entity45 's good form in 2014 in @entity5 and other tournaments , it would be a huge shock if he was not named as the number two singles player behind @entity44 against the @entity29			2
@entity0 - who played three matches for @entity80 between 2010 and 2012 , all in dead rubbers - said : ' i 'm in contact with @entity64 and he 's also excited to hear the news			1
we 're all hoping it goes through			0
' @entity0 made a fine start to the new season by coming through qualifying in @entity89 before beating 88th - ranked @entity90 on tuesday to set up a second - round match against @entity92			0
from @entity93 , he heads to @entity94 where he will play in @entity97 qualifying , and he is optimistic a better season lies ahead			0
he said : ' it 's great to start the season with qualies and a first - round win , especially against a top - 100 player			0
i 'm satisfied with my performances so far and i 'm looking forward to the next match			0
' i 'm looking forward to playing a full season finally			0
i want to show that i 'm much better than the ranking shows			0
