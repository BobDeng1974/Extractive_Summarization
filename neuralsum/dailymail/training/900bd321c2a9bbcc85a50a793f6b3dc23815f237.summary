by @entity0 published : 05:16 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 06:02 est , 19 november 2013 a city council has sent thousands of leaflets to homes telling people how to put out their bins , it was revealed today			2
the 5,000 leaflets distributed by @entity8 use images with green ticks and red crosses to describe the correct angle for wheelie bins to be placed before they are collected by binmen			1
the flyers , which have been sent out in the @entity18 and @entity19 areas , were distributed following health and safety fears that workers could be injured if they handled bins left facing the wrong way			1
advice : the 5,000 leaflets distributed by @entity8 use images with green ticks and red crosses to describe the correct angle for wheelie bins to be placed before they are collected by binmen the initiative - which has been branded ‘ condescending ’ by critics who said ‘ how to put out a bin is hardly rocket science ’ - cost £ 227 in printing costs , plus the money spent on design and delivery			1
@entity38 , from the city services department , said : ‘ it ’s not about saving time			0
the bigger issue we have is that we are going back to the days of black bin bags and manual handling issues			2
‘ if we have 200 bins the wrong way around on a street we reintroduce the manual handling aspect of bin collection and we could have lots of people with musculoskeletal problems			1
’ he told the @entity53 the picture design was chosen to avoid problems with language in the areas targeted by the council in the trial - and there was no intention to patronise people			0
but campaign group the @entity63 ’ @entity62 was left fuming at what it called a ‘ pointless exercise ’			0
getting it right : the flyers were distributed in @entity8 following health and safety fears that workers could be injured if they handle bins left facing the wrong way ( file picture ) political director @entity75 said : ' @entity76 ought to be focusing on providing a decent bin service rather than spending valuable time and money sending out this condescending leaflet			1
' keeping residents informed is important , but how to put out a bin is hardly rocket science ' @entity75 , @entity63 ’ @entity62 ' keeping residents informed is important , but how to put out a bin is hardly rocket science			0
when money is tight for families and local authorities alike , the council should not be wasting money on this sort of pointless exercise			0
' city resident @entity94 , who saw the leaflets , told the @entity53 : ‘ if this is a health and safety issue why has it only been raised now and , if so , is it not a health and safety issue to residents ? ‘ binmen have taken laziness to a whole new level			2
why are the council allowing this to happen ? shall i get tuesdays off work and load my own bins ? ’			0
