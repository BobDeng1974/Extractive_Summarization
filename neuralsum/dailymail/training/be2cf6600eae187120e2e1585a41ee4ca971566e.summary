by @entity1 reporter published : 18:05 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 04:02 est , 14 october 2013 short supply : hospital bosses have been forced abroad in their hunt for staff one in three hospitals is bringing in nurses from abroad because wards are so understaffed , an investigation has found			1
@entity12 managers are travelling to countries including @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and the @entity19 in the drive to recruit nurses			0
but concerns have been raised over the @entity24 - speaking abilities of some foreign staff , while others may lack training and experience			0
and mps and campaigners say it is absurd some hospitals are making nurses redundant or have imposed recruitment freezes while others are desperately having to poach them from abroad			2
separate figures from the @entity38 show the number of foreign nurses coming to work in @entity41 has doubled in just three years , up from 2,306 to 4,521			1
this means nearly a fifth of the 25,500 new nurses registering each year are from abroad			0
an investigation by @entity46 using @entity48 requests found that 40 out of 105 hospital trusts have actively recruited nurses from abroad within the past 12 months			1
in total they had poached some 1,360 nurses from abroad			1
but over the past few years concerns have been raised over the poor language and medical skills of nurses – and doctors – working for the @entity12 , with some patients claiming they have had to use sign language			0
some of @entity41 ’s foremost doctors have expressed their own frustration – including @entity62 , a fertility specialist , who warned that nurses from @entity65 have been ‘ trained in a completely different way ’			2
@entity66 , chief executive of the @entity67 said : ‘ in all of the caring services , good communications is vitally important for a number of reasons			0
‘ if language issues prevent this level of communication then clearly patient care will suffer and safety is compromised			0
’ the @entity38 ’s figures also show three quarters of the foreign nurses that registered to work in @entity41 last year were from @entity82 countries and therefore did not face language or skills checks			1
influx : figures have revealed that one in three hospitals are bringing in foreign nurses , who now make up a fifth of all newly - registered nurses @entity92 rules prohibit such tests being carried out on nurses from member states as they are deemed a threat to ‘ freedom of labour ’			1
only last month research by @entity100 found more than 40 per cent of hospital wards did not have enough nurses to run safely			2
and this summer an investigation into hospitals with the highest death rates by the @entity12 medical director professor sir @entity106 found evidence of widespread nursing shortages			0
although the numbers of nurses working in the @entity12 increased by more than a fifth under @entity113 , over the past three years they have begun falling again			0
figures show there are now 5,000 fewer posts compared to april 2010 and some trusts have been making staff redundant			1
a @entity120 spokesman said : ‘ recruiting from abroad is nothing new			2
overseas nurses make a very valuable contribution to @entity12 patient care			1
' however , they should only ever work in the @entity12 if they have proven their competence and language skills			0
