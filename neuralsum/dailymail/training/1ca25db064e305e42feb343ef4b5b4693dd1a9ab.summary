by @entity0 for more than 80 years , the @entity2 cooker has been the heart of thousands of quintessentially @entity5 homes			1
permanently on and warming the kitchen , it has brought comfort and joy to those who swear by its traditional simplicity and old - style charm			2
but now the @entity2 has been thrust into the digital age with the launch of a model which can be turned on and off with a text message			1
it has three ovens – for roasting , baking and simmering – all of which can be operated remotely			1
it is a development of the £ 9,895 aga @entity37 cooker , which was the first electric @entity2 that could be switched on and off as the user required			2
traditional @entity40 – which are on all the time , guzzle up to 40 litres of oil a week and pump carbon dioxide into the air – have been criticised for being environmentally unfriendly			2
modern @entity46 are programmable and reach cooking temperature only when you need them			2
the new model receives commands via a standard mobile phone sim card inserted into a small box , similar to a broadband router , which is connected to the cooker by a cable			1
cyber-stove : @entity59 users can also log in to a dedicated website to turn on any of the three ovens from afar - the oven connects to your home @entity62 , so you do n't need to run wiring through the kitchen once the cooker is installed , you save its unique phone number into your mobile and when you wish to operate it remotely you text one of the following commands : roasting oven on ; baking oven on ; simmering oven on ; all ovens on ; all zones off			1
once the text has been sent you receive a reply saying , for example , ‘ roasting oven on activated ’			0
the @entity2 can also be operated via an app which can be downloaded to smartphones from @entity86 ’s app store or the @entity87			0
owners can also register on a dedicated website which allows them to control the oven from a laptop			1
the makers yesterday hailed it as their response to ‘ things getting decidedly more techie in the kitchen ’ these days			0
‘ you can ensure the cooker is warm and supper will be cooked at exactly the time you need it – wherever you are in the world , ’ said a spokesman			0
but not all @entity2 lovers are simmering with excitement at the new model			1
best - selling author @entity106 , 75 , speaking from her home in @entity108 , said : ‘ i do n’t believe it – it ’s the silliest thing i ’ve ever heard			0
i love my @entity2 to bits , but i ca n’t even text on the phone			0
‘ oh bless it , will i have to learn to text now ? maybe something like this will drag me into the 21st century at last			0
’ miss @entity106 , who is writing her latest novel about flat - racing , added : ‘ agas are heaven			0
the wonderful thing about mine is that it ’s always on and i can leave it on overnight and slow - cook stews for my dogs for the morning			0
’ the new model has a built - in sim card but can also be controlled via apps on @entity125 and smartphones video : see the @entity128 working here ... a demo for the new @entity25 is coming soon !			1

new model can also be controlled by smartphone and @entity125 apps
@entity59 users can turn on any of its three ovens using a *special* website
