changes to the @entity7 service mean the current ' catch - up window ' will be extended from the current seven days to 30 days			2
however it also means the @entity0 will come under even more pressure to close the legal loophole which currently allows half a million households to avoid the licence fee by watching only catch - up tv			1
earlier this year , director general @entity15 said he wanted to crack down on those who wait to watch on their tablets and computers for free			0
the latest changes mean viewers will have even longer to download or stream programmes , making it even easier to avoid paying			2
