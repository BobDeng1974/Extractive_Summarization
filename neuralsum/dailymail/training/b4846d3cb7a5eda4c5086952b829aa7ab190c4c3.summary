a @entity22 post from @entity0 's representative stated : ' @entity0 was appalled to learn that his music was linked to @entity3 's extraordinary attack on @entity25			1

' he has asked his representatives to make sure his music is withdrawn and especially from these unfair aggressive and ignorant comments			2
' the comment , posted on monday , was ' liked ' by more than 6,000 people			0
a later post from the musician , who has received the @entity38 , explained : ' i am a real believer in the @entity40 and would defend @entity3 ’s right to mouth off about almost anything			2
' i just do n’t like my work being used as the bed track for prejudice or hatred			1
' the backlash against @entity3 has intensified in recent days , as more than 40 advertisers dropped their support of his radio program and two stations have pulled the plug on it			0
he said : ' nobody is losing money here , including us ... we do n’t get any revenue from ‘ em anyway			0
the whole effort is to dispirit you			0
' even the president weighed into controversy			0
during president @entity76 's press conference yesterday at the @entity77 , he had little to say about the controversy at first			1
@entity76 said : ' i 'm not going to comment on what sponsors decide to do			1
i 'm not going to comment on either the economics or the politics of it			0
' i do n't know what 's in @entity3 's heart , so i 'm not going to comment on the sincerity of his apology			1
' but he said that he was compelled to offer his support to @entity7 after considering his own children , daughters @entity93 , 13 , and @entity94 , 10			1
controversy : during his first press conference of 2012 , president @entity76 weighed in on the uproar surrounding radio host @entity3 , right , after he called @entity7 a ' slut ' on the air @entity76 said : ' the reason i called ms @entity7 is because i thought about @entity93 and @entity94 , and one of the things i want them to do as they get older is to engage in issues they care about , even ones i may not agree with them on			1
' reaction : @entity8 law student and activist @entity7 speaks during an appearance on the daytime talk show , ' @entity111 ' about the comments he made on his programme he added : ' i want them to be able to speak their mind in a civil and thoughtful way			1
' and i do n't want them attacked or called horrible names because they 're being good citizens			2
' and i wanted @entity7 to know that i thought her parents should be proud of her , and that we want to send a message to all our young people that being part of a democracy involves argument and disagreements and debate , and we want you to be engaged , and there 's a way to do it that does n't involve you being demeaned and insulted , particularly when you ’re a private citizen '			1
some 42 firms were pulling sponsorship deals from @entity3 's radio show , fans refused to tune in and a couple of stations dropped its broadcast			2
these included @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 have all stopped advertising with the show			0
@entity159 in @entity160 , @entity161 , and @entity162 in @entity163 , @entity164 , were no longer airing the show			0
listeners of smaller , local radio stations that broadcast the syndicated show were being called on to pressure advertisers to cut all ties			0
@entity172 users were also spreading the message using the hashtags # @entity175 , # @entity176 and # @entity177			0
several @entity22 pages sprung up and attracted thousands of fans to support the action			0
@entity3 made a rare public apology on saturday in the wake of the uproar caused by his comments			0
but @entity7 , who became @entity3 's target after she testified about birth control before a @entity188 panel , questioned the sincerity of the apology , adding that she did not want to hear from @entity3 personally			1
' the statements he ’s made about me over the air are personal enough , so i ’d rather not have a personal phone call with him , ' ms @entity7 said on @entity65 ’s @entity111			1
@entity3 admitted that his ' choice of words was not the best ' and could n’t resist taking a swipe at his opponents			0
' i acted too much like the leftists who despise me			0
i descended to their level , using names and exaggerations , ' he said			0
' it ’s what we ’ve come to expect from them , but it ’s way beneath me			0
' anger : many advertisers reacted to @entity3 's controversial ' slut ' comments by suspending adverts on the programme decision : @entity215 has also decided to boycott the show the comments amplified an election - year clash over @entity76 ’s plan to require health insurers to cover contraception			1
@entity223 presidential candidates have cast the plan as an attack on religion as they court socially conservative voters			2
but they have distanced themselves from @entity3 ’s incendiary rhetoric as polls show that nearly two - thirds of voters support @entity76 ’s plan			1
@entity3 apologised again on monday but continued to criticize ms @entity7 ’s efforts to force the @entity234 university to include contraception in its health insurance coverage			1
' if birth control insurance is important to you as an enrolling student … you might want to attend or work at a school that is n’t run by @entity242 , ' he said			2
@entity3 ’s show is broadcast for three hours each weekday			0
@entity245 , a broadcast industry trade publication , estimated that @entity3 reaches at least 15million people a week , the most of any @entity250 radio talk show			2
his comments are the latest wrinkle in a battle over birth control and religious freedom that have emerged as a surprise hot - button issue in the 2012 presidential contest			2
boycott : @entity259 has also decided to suspend all advertising on the show religious organizations , the @entity242 and social conservatives have protested @entity76 ’s policy , which originally required all employers that provide health insurance to cover contraceptives , as an infringement on religious liberty			2
@entity76 subsequently tweaked the policy so that religiously affiliated employers like hospitals , universities and charities would not be required to cover the cost			2
that did not satisfy catholic bishops , who reject artificial contraceptives			0
@entity223 in @entity188 have unsuccessfully tried to repeal the new birth control rule , an effort that @entity281 , in turn , have cast as a @entity223 ' war on women '			0
the @entity284 said it has raised $ 1.6million since @entity7 testified on @entity285 two weeks ago , tying the flurry of donations to outrage over the @entity223 ’ action			1
' it ’s a dramatic loser for the @entity223 , because the vast majority of @entity250 women use birth control at some point in their lives , ' said @entity298 political science professor @entity297 .			0
