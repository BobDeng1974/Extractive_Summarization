@entity0 , 30 , who suffered from encephalitis , with his partner @entity2 , 27 looking back on last autumn , @entity0 can scarcely believe what happened			1
four weeks after developing insomnia , he was suffering from panic attacks and suicidal thoughts			0
he was then sectioned and sent to a mental health ward for two months			1
but he was n't mentally ill. @entity0 , 30 , had a form of encephalitis - brain inflammation - caused when his own immune system started attacking a protein in the brain , affecting its function			1
it 's thought that a simple virus might have kicked his immune system into overdrive			0
yet his condition was only correctly diagnosed last november , three months after he 'd been sectioned - despite him showing classic signs of encephalitis , such as memory loss			1
worryingly , many experts believe encephalitis , as well as other common neurological disorders such as dementia and even migraines , are often misdiagnosed as mental health problems because their symptoms include depression and anxiety			1
' dozens of neurological conditions can be missed as purely mental health illnesses , ' says @entity34 , a lecturer in biomedical science at the @entity36 and director of the @entity38			1
' these include mini strokes [ transient ischaemic attacks ] , which can change behaviour , for example by making people more impulsive or emotional , depending on the affected part of the brain			1
' last week a study published in the journal @entity49 reported that depression , anxiety and irritability can be early signs of @entity54 's before the more typical memory loss and confusion appear			1
meanwhile , @entity57 's can result in depression , anxiety and psychosis			1
and many patients suffering headaches are diagnosed with anxiety , panic attacks , depression or fatigue , yet it 's actually migraine that 's likely to be causing these symptoms , says dr @entity68 , of the @entity69 in @entity70			1
' migraine can cause a huge variety of symptoms , including low mood , poor sleep and fatigue			2
those patients can be given antidepressants , which may not be the appropriate treatment , ' says dr silver			0
if patients have no mental health symptoms when they are ' crystal - clear and headache - free ' , it may suggest migraine is to blame - whereas depression would cause these symptoms consistently			1
around 40 per cent of migraine sufferers find eliminating all painkillers and caffeine and eating and drinking regularly will banish all or most of those associated symptoms			2
after trying to hang himself @entity0 was sectioned and taken to a mental health hospital in @entity93 meanwhile , antidepressants can actually reduce the quality of sleep , and may worsen migraine			1
certain types of epilepsy can lead to confusion and odd behaviour because seizures can damage different parts of the brain , while brain tumours and parasitic diseases such as @entity107 - a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks - can also cause mental health symptoms , such as low mood and erratic behaviour			1
and problems with the parathyroid glands ( which control calcium levels ) can cause irrational behaviour , because excessively high calcium levels affect the function of the brain and central nervous system			2
' gps are n't always aware of different symptoms associated with these conditions , and the easy option is to give patients antidepressants			2
so they are n't getting the right treatments , ' says dr @entity34			0
this means patients may not be referred to a neurologist , who could make the correct diagnosis , and are instead under the care of a mental health team			1
@entity0 's problems started last april , when he caught a virus that caused mouth ulcers , sickness , diarrhoea and led to poor sleep			1
a month later he developed insomnia , rashes on his arms , legs and waist , and his hands and feet started to blister			0
he saw a gp in june			0
' i thought my body was just struggling to fight off an infection , ' says @entity0 , an it consultant who lives with his partner , @entity147 , 27 , in @entity148			1
his gp took blood , stool and urine samples but the results came back clear			0
the gp handed him a leaflet on anxiety management			2
@entity0 , who 'd otherwise been a fit and healthy young man , then started having panicked thoughts			2
' i 'd convince myself i 'd die from a heart attack after a run , or a plane would fall out of the sky on to me			0
i 'd never been a worrier before , but i was fixated on irrational fears			0
' @entity0 was finally diagnosed with @entity162 after having a panic attack and experiencing suicidal thoughts , he was prescribed antidepressants and a sedative , diazepam - his gp also recommended a private therapist as there was a long waiting list on the @entity69			1
initially , the therapist helped , but shortly after this @entity0 had a massive panic attack			2
' my head felt as if it was burning and my muscles locked up			0
i could n't breathe properly but was screaming , ' he says			0
his parents , who he was visiting at the time , called an ambulance			0
he had blood tests , a chest x-ray and ct scan in hospital before doctors declared the problem was ' truly psychological ' and discharged him			0
' i thought i was having a mental breakdown , which felt awful as it was so unlike me , ' says @entity0			1
he then started having memory problems , forgetting who his relatives were , for example			0
after another panic attack , he was taken back to hospital			0
this time mental health services were called and he was given stronger antidepressants			1
but they had no effect - and weeks later @entity0 tried to hang himself			1
' i felt life was not worth living			0
i 'm so lucky the belt snapped			0
' he was then sectioned and taken to a mental health hospital in @entity93 , roughly 120 miles from his home , because there were no closer beds available			1
' i ca n't remember much after this point , ' says @entity0			2
' apparently , i tried escaping , and told people i did n't need to be there			0
' a week later he was transferred to the mental health ward at @entity207 in @entity148 , where he stayed for seven weeks			1
' in my notes , which months later i asked for , doctors kept noting my lack of memory , but never considered a neurological explanation			2
' he was referred to a sleep clinic at @entity215 and @entity216 for his poor sleep , but then he started falling asleep all the time - even while eating			2
the sleep expert recognised something else was wrong with him , and urged his doctors at @entity207 to revisit his case			0
a week later his sodium levels plummeted - because the brain regulates sodium , anything affecting the brain can alter levels - and he went into a coma - like state			2
the number of prescriptions written for antidepressants in the @entity233 every year he was taken to @entity215 and @entity216 where he was seen by a neurologist for the first time			0
three - and - a - half weeks later in november , after a series of tests , @entity0 was finally diagnosed with anti-nmda receptor encephalitis			1
this is a rare form of the disease , caused by antibodies produced by the immune system targeting the @entity244 protein in the brain			2
symptoms include seizures , confusion and problems with cognitive function			1
dr @entity251 , a consultant neurologist and senior research fellow at @entity253 , says : ' typical forms of psychosis and depression occur over months , while in these auto - immune forms of encephalitis the symptoms can appear over days or weeks			1
' @entity0 was given steroids and intravenous immune globulin ( infusions of antibodies from donors )			2
two days later he became fully conscious for the first time since august			0
' i could n't believe it was november			0
doctors said inflammation in my brain had affected parts of it controlling memory and emotions , causing my symptoms			1
it was incredible how normal i felt			0
' five days later he was discharged			0
the big issue is the split between psychiatry and other areas of medicine , says @entity283 , a consultant neurologist at the @entity284 in @entity285			0
' it would help if psychiatrists and neurologists had closer working practices , but largely that does n't happen			0
' increasingly , patients are being seen not by psychiatrists , but by mental health nurses , psychologists and cognitive behavioural therapists , who may not always be able to recognise these disorders , adds dr silver			1
@entity0 has a one in ten chance of relapse , but now knows the signs so he can get treatment quickly			2
' it 's scary that there are probably other people in the mental health system who are not really psychotic and have a physical cause for their symptoms that they are n't being treated for , ' he says			1
' i 'm amazed @entity147 stood by me through all this - she 's my rock			0
' february 22 is @entity311 for more information on the condition , visit @entity314			0

@entity0 , 30 , from @entity148 , was sent to mental health ward
