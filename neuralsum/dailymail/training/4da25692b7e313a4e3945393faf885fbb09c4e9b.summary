two frightening incidents of vandalism in @entity2 near the @entity4 border in @entity5 have been interpreted as warnings from drug cartels			1
in both instances , a mannequin wearing a suit and tie was tied to a billboard with a noose and messages were scrawled over the placards			0
local station @entity16 reports that one of the signs reads ' @entity20 ' which translates to ' silver or lead ' , a threat used commonly against police officers effectively warning that if they do not accept the cartel 's bribes then they will be shot			1
threat : the translation of the painted vandalism means ' silver or lead ' which is meant to mean that police officers and business owners should either accept bribes or expect gunshots scary : a mannequin wearing a suit and tie was seen hanging from a noose from the @entity2 billboard ' this symbol has historically been used by @entity4 drug cartels to threaten or intimidate @entity4 citizens , business owners and government officials ; however , we have never experienced this in @entity2 , ' local police said in a press release about the vandalism			1
the fear now for many is that the ' warnings ' shows that the drug cartels - which have not been identified by name - are willing to bring the violence from @entity4 border towns into @entity5			1
' maybe the problems in @entity59 are coming over here , ' @entity2 resident @entity57 told @entity16			2
mr @entity57 and his wife @entity60 know the terror of drug cartels on a personal level after two relatives were murdered in the area of @entity59 in 2009			2
second incident : the second message was written over an existing @entity69 billboard calling for the capture of drug lord @entity71 the second instance of vandalism had a more obtuse warning , but the theme ran through since the message was written on an existing @entity69 billboard			0
the message was different this time , as the paint read : ' dying for drugs ' was written over a wanted poster calling for the capture of drug lord @entity71			0
this second mannequin was dressed in jeans rather than the suit and tie from the other instance			0
the mannequins were a particularly jarring image for many familiar with the drug war , as some of the most violent drug lords south of the border regularly hang offenders off highway overpasses			2
while a warning from drug lords seems like one of the most likely prospects , @entity16 reports that prosecutors have another theory that the vandalism also could have been caused by activist groups working against the war on drugs .			0

two billboards along highways in @entity2 , @entity5 were vandalized and had mannequins hanging off of them
one reads ' silver or lead ' in @entity112 which is taken to mean that police and business owners can either take drug cartels ' bribes or die
*worries* *spreading* that cartels that have ruled @entity4 border towns with violence may be headed north
