@entity1 manager @entity0 has asked @entity2 to curb his ' fearless ' approach as the @entity5 striker hopes to return from long - term injury on saturday			1
the 25 - year - old could be on the bench for the home tie with @entity10 and see what would be his first competitive action since injuring ankle ligaments on a pre-season tour of @entity15			1
@entity0 said : ' maybe @entity2 could think about modifying his game a touch			1
he is so brave and i fear some of the injuries come from that			0
' he is a whole - hearted , committed player			0
i can not tell him to pull out of challenges			0
but with experience , you know what you can win and what you definitely ca n't			0
' and that might steer him clear of an injury or two			2
' @entity0 admits @entity2 may have to do adapt his ' fearless ' approach to the game @entity2 has recently become engaged to former @entity44 star @entity43 blonde bombshell @entity43 shows off her ring after getting engaged to @entity2 recently finally deciding to settle down off the pitch can only help @entity2 's mindset when he is fully fit and returns to the @entity1 attack , according to @entity0			1
the @entity50 boss believes @entity2 is now ready to put his well - documented off - field problems firmly behind him , having recently become engaged to former @entity44 star @entity43			1
' @entity2 has now got a different life			2
he is not a single man in @entity54 and has now got his fiancee , ' said @entity0 , who encouraged @entity2 's gym sessions with his then girlfriend during rehabiliation from an injury sustained on a pre-season tour of @entity15			1
' the romance has blossomed to the point where he feels that she feels that they want a long - term relationship , and i always think that can be very good for a footballer when they settle down more off the field			0
' @entity54 can be a very lonely city if you are sat in your apartment on your own every single night - maybe you stay out that little bit too late			0
' but when you have a relationship , you start building on that relationship by the fondness you have for each other and i think that can only be good for @entity2 and his football			2
