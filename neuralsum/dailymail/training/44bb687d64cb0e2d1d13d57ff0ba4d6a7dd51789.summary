from one of the world ’s greatest fighters who is on a missionary visit to the @entity5 to a very local lad bearing a grudge in @entity8 , this is the first hectic weekend of boxing ’s new winter season			0
@entity10 will try to put a potential billion dollar fight with @entity12 out of his mind so as to concentrate on beating @entity15 challenger @entity14 in @entity16			1
defeat for the @entity10 in a catch - weight defence of his world welterweight title against a little - known light - welter champion would be a disaster commercially as well as for his legacy			1
with talks reportedly on - going with @entity12 for the mega event the world has been waiting so long to see , this is a fight @entity10 can not afford to lose			1
@entity10 ( left ) prepares for bout with @entity14 of the @entity15 in @entity16 this weekend not with his promoter @entity28 striving to open up the huge @entity30 boxing market to its first pay - per - view fight			1
not that he is likely to be beaten			0
@entity28 will be anxious that @entity30 ’s own boxing idol , three - time world amateur champion and double olympic gold medallist @entity34 , wins as well			2
@entity34 ’s success is the key to persuading the @entity38 government to permit subscription television for his fights			0
expect him to prevail , also			0
amusingly , against a @entity42 flyweight who looks so much like @entity10 that they call him @entity44			2
another , even greater , ex-amateur finds himself on this bill in the remarkable position of defending a world title in only his third professional fight			0
@entity52 ’s @entity51 takes on a @entity42 who , with 52 wins from his 53 fights , comes from the opposite end of the boxing spectrum			0
earlier on @entity59 , @entity58 angrily seeks home - town revenge for his previous defeat by former light - heavyweight world champion @entity62			1
@entity62 and @entity58 continued their hostilities at the weigh - in on friday afternoon the hostile build - up , brilliantly stage - managed by promoter @entity67 , has elevated a fight between two men who were each knocked out in recent world title fights into a pay - per - view @entity71 on @entity74 television			1
some selling job , this			0
however , this is a competitive match - up in its own right			0
it is also a good mix of styles between @entity82 the slugger from the streets and @entity62 the stylist with a university degree in mathematics			2
@entity58 ’s hunger for redemption should make him more dangerous this time around and @entity62 will need to have recovered his appetite for boxing if he is to repeat his victory and be the one moving on towards a world cruiser - weight title bid			1
@entity94 may be given a sharp work - out by @entity96 in his latest come - back fight from that devastating @entity98 by @entity99			2
the rest of the starry cast - list on @entity67 ’s packed promotion – including @entity103 and @entity104 in @entity106 title defences - should improve their records with victories ranging from comfortable to one - sided			0
