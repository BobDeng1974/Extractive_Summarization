by @entity0 @entity2 users are furious after the company debuted a major resign of the popular email service that eliminated many features and , some claim , left it looking like a knock off of competitor @entity9			1
observers say the ' beautiful ' new look of @entity2 is a product of new @entity15 ceo @entity14 - and it has backfired			2
the mail service 's 275million users were ' surprised ' on october 8 with the redesign and tens of thousands have complained about glitches and reduced functionality			1
many simply do n't like the look and feel of the new product			2
' there is a reason those in this forum use @entity15 and not @entity9			1
it is based on a difference in thinking how best to design webmail for both the casual and power user , ' writes one commenter , who has received more than 27,000 votes on the @entity15 forum for the redesign			2
@entity15 ceo @entity14 has been personally blamed by many for the failings in the new @entity2 redesign new and improved ? tens of thousands of @entity2 users logged complaints over the redesign of the email interface the @entity2 users adds : ' this is a major issue that determines the usability of the product			1
' one writer on the tech site @entity51 has called the redesign a ' disaster ' that has left many users questions whether they will keep using @entity15 or flee to other online email services			2
the biggest complaint has been the elimination of a feature that allows users to open search pages and emails in individual tabs - something that distinguished @entity2 from its biggest competitor , @entity9			1
one user wrote : ' the only reason i use yahoo is for the tabs			2
if tabs are gone , then i will be gone			0
' another complaint : in their haste to create a streamlined interface for their email service , @entity15 designers somehow forgot to add a ' print ' button for users who need paper copies of their emails			1
' now there is no way to print just the email frame ! please fix ! ! ! ' demanded one user			0
thousands of users say they want the old interface brought back - along with the features that were scrubbed by the update look familiar ? many users say the new @entity2 interface is simply a @entity9 ripoff another @entity2 user responded , saying : ' someone said 10 lashes to the @entity15 team			1
i think that is not a sufficient number of lashes			0
' users also complained that they can no longer sort their email by sender			1
one person says : ' that 's important functionality			0
i ca n't believe that such a feature was overlooked ! ' thousands of other users reported major glitches or bugs in the new system - including drafts not saving , emails not being sent properly , text not being formatted properly and errors logging into to the site			1
the @entity15 forums have logged nearly 5,200 complaints about bugs in the last six days			0
many users place the blame squarely on the shoulders of @entity122 , who was a top @entity123 executive before she was hired to lead @entity15 in july 2012			0
' she is delusional ... she has no clue ... we all have @entity127 ...			0
that is not why we use yahoo mail ...			0
we use yahoo mail because it has @entity133 , ' one user said , referring to @entity122			0
' and the fact that she did no research into this like not a single poll or test of this monster before she rolled it out			0

new interface *stripped* away tabs function that allowed users to open *multiple* emails in the same *window*
users can no longer sort emails by sender
redesign also removed the ' print ' button
users say that if they wanted a @entity9 - like service , they would simply have *switched* to @entity9
