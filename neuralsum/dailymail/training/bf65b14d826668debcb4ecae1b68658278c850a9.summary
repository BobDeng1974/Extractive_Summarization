on a @entity2 afternoon of brooding clouds , driving rain and seething frustration , the face of @entity1 beamed out like a beacon			1
for the world @entity7 has discovered his most formidable form when it matters most and the second week carries the promise of dramatic achievement			2
his satisfaction could not be concealed or contained			2
his 6 - 7 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 victory over @entity14 of @entity15 was scarcely unexpected but the manner of his triumph , the way in which he was required to solve his problems and find his game , was enormously impressive			2
he was watched from the @entity35 by some of the most imposingly regal figures in @entity39 sport			2
@entity40 , whose aristocratic credentials are increasingly accepted , @entity42 , of blessed @entity44 memory , and sir @entity45 , whose blood runs as blue as anybody born to the purple			2
they stood as one when @entity1 closed out his success , recognising a kindred spirit , acclaiming a champion at the peak of his powers			1
the @entity57 would later express his delight in his progress			1
' i finished all my matches playing better than when i started and that is very positive			2
i 'm very happy to be in the second week after two years losing in the first and second rounds			2
i am fighting for every ball and playing to find the right solutions in every game			2
' ouch ! the @entity57 lost the first set after a tense tiebreak on centre court on saturday afternoon from a man who is not given to idle chatter , it sounded distinctly ominous for his rivals			1
@entity1 plays tennis like a great fighter warming to his work			1
watch him open his body to throw the big forehand and you see images of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , that dazzling trinity of terrifying middleweights			0
the intent is mean , the execution savagely impeccable , the effect disastrous			0
in the thin , grey light beneath the @entity92 roof , with the rain splattering the crowds outside and june wearing the colours of january , the similarity was irresistible			1
and it was a genuine contest , a real match for an hour of the first unpredictable set			1
@entity14 , ranked 63 in the world , went for his shots without fear of consequence			0
and the greater the gamble , the greater the reward			0
the first serve was testing , the double - fisted backhand a blunt weapon			0
hard as @entity1 worked and chased , his unfancied opponent found most of the answers			1
his tie - break success was awarded the clamorous approval of the @entity92 crowd			0
given a right runaround ! @entity14 struggled to cope once he took the first set as @entity1 progressed easily ' he played fantastic in that first set , ' said @entity1			1
' i was thinking : " if he is able to play like that for three sets , i will be in trouble "			0
' he considered his problems on an extended toilet break at the close of the set			1
when he emerged , to the faint disapproval of that crowd , he was a man restored			0
mild incontinence is a besetting affliction of certain tennis stars , especially when they have just lost a set , but he seemed surprised at the faint hint that he had been guilty of gamesmanship			1
' i needed to go to the bathroom , that 's all			1
it was n't because i wanted to have a break			0
' with a truly @entity140 reticence on such matters , his questioners did not press him further			0
in any event , the change in his game was impossibly dramatic			0
the great ones in any sport can lift their form when they most need to and @entity1 simply flicked a switch and surged away			1
aware that he had lost the opening set of both his matches last week , @entity1 was also aware that he could find himself at will			1
he broke @entity14 in the fourth game of the second set and from there his course was set			1
a little bit damp : @entity2 was a sea of umbrellas on a miserable day in @entity158 as the winners began to flow , as the pace was raised and the angles became more improbable , his opponent seemed almost visibly to shrink			1
the warrior of the first set now wore the nervous apprehension of a bank clerk plucked from the crowd and furnished with a racquet			1
where his problems had once seemed so simple , now they were far beyond solution			0
@entity1 hustled through the second set in 35 minutes and the third in 28			1
at times , we wanted to look away , the way we used to when @entity82 had trapped some pain - racked victim on the ropes			0
there was one hopelessly outclassed contender who asked his manager for the best way to approach a fight with @entity184			0
' do n't make him angry , ' came the useful response			0
@entity186 could have employed a similar tactic			0
@entity188 followed game in unchallenged monotony , with the fourth set going the way of its predecessors			2
' i played aggressive , i had great movement , i just felt great , ' said @entity1			1
' nobody can say this is not a special place			2
' likewise , nobody can say that this is not a remarkably special player			0
there were times yesterday when he wore that air of invulnerability , times when he seemed quite unplayable			0
all may change over this crucial week , of course			0
the likes of @entity208 , @entity209 , even @entity206 may come up with the answers which were way beyond @entity14			0
but the current signs are enormously encouraging for @entity1			1
champion in 2008 and 2010 , his chances of a third title were shining brightly through the @entity2 gloom .			0

@entity57 lost the opening set on centre court
@entity1 's win was the only match taking place as rain affected @entity158
