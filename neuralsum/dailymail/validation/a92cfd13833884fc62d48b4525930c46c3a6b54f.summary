a married couple who were so desperate to be parents they sold all their valuables to fund costly fertility treatment finally have the baby of their dreams - after winning a competition			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity11 , had tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to fall pregnant , attempting to conceive naturally - even experimenting with fertility - boosting yoga hanging upside down after intercourse			1
but after finding themselves broke after almost a decade of unsuccessful attempts , the pair ended up winning the chance to have a baby in a competition run by an ivf charity - and this week celebrate the second birthday of their son @entity22			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity11 , celebrate their son @entity22 's 2nd birthday this week @entity22 , pictured newborn , was conceived after @entity9 wrote a heartfelt plea to the charity babyquest explaining the couples years of fertility struggles after starting to after visiting a fertility clinic in december 2009 , tests found mr @entity33 had low testosterone levels and mrs @entity10 was diagnosed with endometriosis , a polycystic ovary and a blocked fallopian tube			1
the couple started @entity39 – intrauterine insemination – which involves separating out the fastest moving sperm and placing them in the womb			1
but the costly treatment meant they were forced to sell possessions in their home to cover the $ 10,000 ( £ 6000 ) cost			2
' we became so desperate to get pregnant we sold everything of value in our home , to fund the @entity39 , ' mrs @entity10 , 30 , said			1
@entity10 and @entity9 on their wedding day : ' when i married my wife my intention was to give her the world , but instead we have known struggle ' @entity9 said in his prize - winning letter left : the couple when they first met ; right : pictured recently with @entity22 as he turns two ' with each treatment i hoped we 'd get pregnant			1
and when each one failed we 'd pin our hopes on the next			0
but we had six goes and none of them were successful			0
' my wife and i have seen hardships but none greater than what we currently face			0
' in the first months of our relationship @entity10 and i would sit and talk for hours about our future children			2
' our initial failures did not alarm us , our panic did not begin until we 'd been trying several years			2
' we understood conceiving a baby can sometimes take more time for some than others			0
we needed to try harder but nothing worked			0
' after several failed attempts the heartbreak became more intense			0
' when i married my wife my intention was to give her the world , but instead we have known struggle			2
' as we read about your [ the charity 's ] work , our hopes began to rise to know there are organisations that still exist to help people and ease the pain of others			2
' the pain of infertility is brutal and the tears have been frequent			0
with your [ the charity 's ] help , those tears can finally be dried			2
' ' i felt bitter that other people had children and felt sad and jealous when friends started having babies			0
' in the end our doctor said : " any further treatment along these lines would be a waste of money " '			2
' @entity116 became our only option after this , but we knew it would be expensive , and we 'd run out of things to sell by this point			1
' amazingly , it was mr @entity33 's magical words that saw them get pregnant after they beat 99 other couples to win funding for @entity116 treatment			1
after researching treatment options online , the couple came across a charity , @entity129 , which was granting struggling couples the funding for @entity116			1
so mr @entity33 , 34 , applied , explaining why he and his wife would make perfect parents , and should receive the help			2
' his letter was so heartfelt , ' mrs @entity10 explained			1
' he wrote about our struggle to conceive and about how heart - breaking it had been for us with every negative pregnancy test			2
' incredibly , two months later , in april 2012 , the couple got the call to say they 'd won the funding			2
and less than a year later , in march 2013 , their son @entity22 was born			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' when the doctor said the words i never thought i 'd hear – ' you 're pregnant ' i could n't stop smiling			2
' after eight years of trying we were finally going to have a family of our own – thanks to @entity9 ' beautiful words			1

' @entity9 and i had first spoken about having kids a year after we met when i was 18 and he was 22			1
we were young , but all we ever wanted to be was parents			0
' speaking of her struggle to fall pregnant naturally , mrs @entity10 continued : ' it just did n't happen naturally for us			1
so we tried natural treatments			0
i took vitamins and did yoga to boost my fertility			0
' i even hung upside down , any stupid thing that was suggested , to get me pregnant			0
' we tried not to worry , but as our friends started having families we could n't help it			0
' our sex life became like a military operation			0
each day i 'd take my temperature , and work out which day of the month i 'd be most fertile			0
then we 'd take time off work specifically to try and conceive			0
' having sex stopped being romantic			0
it was like a chore and not fun			0
' mrs @entity10 said of @entity22 ( pictured recently ) : ' we have nothing but thanks for the charity who 've made our family possible			1
@entity22 is our miracle baby ' mrs @entity10 , pictured pregnant , is due to start the process of trying to get pregnant again , with the embryos created during their winning ivf treatment during their plight to be parents , mrs @entity10 admits convincing herself that she was pregnant every time her period was late , and whenever she had an ache or pain , she put it down to a symptom of pregnancy			1
the mum - of - one , said : ' every month another test would be negative and i 'd make excuses , like i 'd tested too early , and try again			0
' we did hundreds of tests and they were always negative			0
it seemed like the one thing i wanted i could n't have			0
i was ashamed that i could n't do what a woman is supposed to do , or give my husband what he wanted			0
' the couple , who celebrate @entity22 's 2nd birthday this week , are due to start the process of trying to get pregnant again , with the embryos created during their winning ivf treatment			1
mrs @entity10 added : ' we have nothing but thanks for the charity who 've made our family possible			1
@entity22 is our miracle baby , and we hope now to give him a brother or sister			1
' without winning that treatment , @entity9 and i would still be struggling to have a baby and still going through all that heartache			1
we really could n't be more thrilled that we won			0
@entity22 is by far the best prize we could 've hoped for			2
' the mum - of - one , said : ' every month another test would be negative and i 'd make excuses , like i 'd tested too early , and try again			0
mrs @entity10 , pictured pregnant , said before winning the competition : ' @entity116 became our only option after this , but we knew it would be expensive , and we 'd run out of things to sell '			1
