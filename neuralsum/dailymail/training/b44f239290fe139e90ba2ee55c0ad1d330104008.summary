scientists have completed an ' autopsy ' - or rather a necropsy , which is an autopsy for animals - on a 9,300 year - old bison			1
the incredible discovery of the remarkably intact animal was made back in july 2011 , but now scientists have taken a look inside			1
and they have revealed the ' mummy ' has a complete brain , heart , blood vessels and digestive system			1
the 9,000 - year - old bison ( pictured ) was discovered in july 2011 in a remote part of @entity15 , but scientists have now performed a necropsy revealing it to have a complete brain , heart , blood vessels and digestive system despite dying towards the end of the @entity23 the most complete frozen mummy of a steppe bison , an extinct bison found on steppes throughout @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity31 , was found in the @entity32 in the @entity33 , @entity34			1
a necropsy was performed to learn about how this animal lived and died at the end of the @entity23			1
it showed the animal had a relatively normal anatomy with no obvious cause of death			2
however , the lack of fat around the abdomen of the animal suggests it may have died from starvation			1
' this is a very rare find , ' dr @entity47 from the @entity48 of @entity49 in @entity50 told @entity52			0
the necropsy on the @entity33 specimen is the first in on the world on such an old bison			1
scientists from a number of @entity15 and @entity61 institutions carried out a full anatomic necropsy			1
this involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites			0
histology samples - those showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - are thought to prove the most interesting , as scientists will be able to study parasites attached to ancient bison for the first time			1
researchers hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison 's digestive organs and to publish their research next year			1
' it is one out of three relatively complete steppe bison mummies that exist in the world , and it is the most complete out of those three			1
' the body is in excellent condition			0
normally , we find the mummies that are significantly damaged by predators in the past , or by modern arctic foxes and others , as soon as mummies are thawed out from the permafrost			0
' such processess happen very quickly , and a mummy that thaws out during summer may be gone in a few months forever			0
dr @entity47 adds that the bison belongs to an extinct species that was found in the early @entity103 - 9,000 to 12,000 years ago			2
she says there are very few records from species at the start of this epoch , known as the @entity110 boundary			0
' this mummy gives us an opportunity to look beyond what for most of the paleontologists impossible to dream of - the opportunity to study genetics and morphology of preserved organs of this animal , ' she said			1
from the necropsy the scientists discovered that the brain appears to be complete , although it has shrunk to 36 per cent of its original volume			1
however it had retained the bulbs , nerves and even medulla oblongata that once allowed the animal to think			2
organs in the throat such as the trachea appeared to be close to their normal sizes , as did the heart , blood vessels , stomach and penis			1
some parts of the animal were significantly shrunk though , including the lungs , liver and left testicle			1
and , as mentioned , the lack of fat in the abdomen and neck suggested it died of starvation			2
the bison â€™s brain was frozen by the freezing conditions in northern @entity34 , leaving its brain remarkably intact			1
here a ct scan of the brain is seen			2
the scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison 's digestive organs and to publish their research next year ' this is a very rare find , ' dr @entity47 from the @entity48 of @entity49 in @entity50 told @entity52			1
' it is one out of three relatively complete steppe bison mummies that exist in the world , and it is the most complete out of those three ' ' the @entity169 bison mummy became the third find out of four now known complete mummies of this species discovered in the world , and one out of two adult specimens that are being kept preserved with internal organs and stored in frozen conditions , ' said dr @entity47 in a separate statement			1
' the next steps to be done include further examination of the bison 's gross anatomy , and other detailed studies on its histology , parasites , and bones and teeth			2
' we expect that the results of these studies will reveal not only the cause of death of this particular specimen , but also might shed light on the species behavior and causes of its extinction			0
' dr @entity197 the @entity198 in @entity199 , added : ' the exclusively good preservation of the @entity169 bison mummy allows direct anatomical comparisons with modern species of @entity203 and cattle , as well as with extinct species of bison that were gone at the @entity110 boundary			0
' scientists from a number of @entity15 and @entity61 institutions carried out a full anatomic necropsy , which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites , on the ancient bision the creature was found perfectly preserved in july 2011 in the @entity33 , also known as @entity33 , where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found			1
the period began between 9,000 to 12,000 years ago at the close of the @entity23			2
@entity219 began to warm and tundra became forest			0
very large animals that had adapted to extreme cold like the woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros became extinct - although woolly mammoths may have lived side - by side bison in parts of @entity15 for a short time			0
humans began to hunt smaller animals			0
one species , @entity232 to which the bison undergoing necropsy might belong , lived in western @entity28 , @entity29 and later in @entity31 before dying out for an unknown reason			2
its body became visible after part of the shore collapsed into the water			0
' the discovery has an enormous value for scientists since it is the best preserved bison ever found , ' said dr @entity244 , chief of the @entity245 of the @entity246 , back in march			2
he told @entity247 : ' we have ascertained that the bison lived 9,000 years ago , at the very beginning of the @entity103 epoch and died aged approximately four			2
' by that time , many mammoths had died here , but the bison still lived			2
' ' the careful and thorough examination we have begun will give us answers to many questions , first of all as to why did the bison die out '			0
scientists from the @entity246 , the @entity260 , @entity261 and the @entity262 of @entity263 carried out the full anatomic necropsy , which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites			2
they were joined by the @entity268 and @entity270 experts from the @entity61			0
@entity61 scientists have long been studying bison living in @entity31 and hope to compare them to the animal 's @entity274 relatives			1
the scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison 's digestive organs and to publish their research next year			1
a close - up of a cross section of the rib cage shows the level of preservation of the ancient animal the 9,000 - year - old bison was found perfectly preserved in july 2011 in the @entity33 , also known as @entity33 ( pictured ) on the shore of a lake in the north of @entity295 - @entity32 district , where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found the scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison 's digestive organs and to publish their research next year			1
@entity302 , senior researcher at the @entity303 of the @entity304 , said in march : ' this is the first study of an ancient mammal for the last 20 years			0
' we have a team of experts from various fields			0
we are keen to learn the animal 's morphology			0
' all its internal organs will be weighed and described			0
all tissue samples will be taken			0
any morphology study [ the structure of an animal ] is connected to the study of animal 's adaptation to his environment and in this particular case to study the palae - ecology will be very interesting			0
here , scientists begin the necropsy and it is possible to see the animal 's perfectly - preserved hair			1
remarkably the brain still had the bulbs , nerves and even medulla oblongata that once allowed the animal to think he said that histology samples - the samples showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - will prove the most interesting , as they will be the first chance scientists have to studying parasites attached to ancient bison			1
' perhaps they did n't preserve , but we will find their dna and the traces of their activity , ' he said			0
' by performing biochemical tests and then comparing them by identical tests of currently living worms we will be able to find out what kind of parasites lived 9,000 years ago			0
' this will be done thanks to a new technology aimed at studying invertebrates ' dna			0
it will be used for the first time on the extinct animal ' .			0

scientists have conducted a necropsy on a 9,300 year old bison
the animal was discovered in 2011 in the @entity33 , @entity34
it has a complete brain , heart , blood vessels and digestive system
many organs were similar to their original size including its heart and penis
others had shrunk considerably including the lungs and left testicle
and scientists think the animal died of starvation at the end of the @entity23
it is the first ' autopsy ' in the world on such an old bison
