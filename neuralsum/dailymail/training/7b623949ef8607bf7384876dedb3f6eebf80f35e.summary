a daredevil sailor has had his name written into the record books - after karate chopping a dozen wooden boards while skydiving from 16,000ft			0
@entity5 , a skydiving instructor who serves in the @entity6 , combined his love of jumping from planes with his other hobby - he is a black belt in karate - to smash his way through 12 blocks on his descent back down to earth			2
@entity5 jumped from such a height that he had to wear an oxygen mask for the initial part of the free fall just so that his brain was engaged enough to pull his parachute chord			1
he said : ' it really was one of the greatest adrenaline rushes of my life			0
' as if throwing myself from an airplane and falling towards the earth at terminal velocity was n't exciting enough , i thought i 'd throw a little karate in the mix and try to smash a world record while i was at it			0
' we jumped from an altitude of 16,000 feet and i would deploy my parachute at 4,000 feet , which gave me approximately 70 seconds of free fall			2
nerves of steel : even a delay due to a technical fault with the team 's plane could n't deter @entity5 , who leapt from a staggering 16,000 ft to perform his stunt @entity64 : the intrepid blackbelt , who serves in the @entity6 , had to wear an oxygen mask for the initial part of the freefall to avoid developing hypoxia which could have stopped him pulling his parachute chord ' that may seem like forever to some but it 's not very long when you 're trying to break a world record			1
' @entity5 had to wear an oxygen mask because falling from such a height can cause hypoxia - a condition caused by lack of oxygen to the brain which can cause a person to become giddy and lack the sensible reasoning needed to pull the parachute chord			0
as well as remembering to pull the chord , @entity5 had to focus long enough on a team of fellow jumpers from @entity91 holding the wooden boards for him to chop			1
tough task : @entity5 had to fight against the force of his fall to chop the 12 wooden boards flying high : he is seen here smashing his way through one of the wooden boards during a 70 second freefall high above the @entity91 skyline challenge : @entity5 decided to tackle the task after watching a video of the previous record holder carrying out his stunt @entity5 added : ' the team of guys that held the board for me were amazing			1
' it 's the equivalent of having a team of flying @entity113 on the basketball court with you asking you what you want them to do			0
' @entity118 based @entity5 decided to complete the jump after watching a video of the previous record holder , actor and mixed martial artist @entity124			2
even a nerve - wracking hour long wait thanks to technical difficulties with the team 's aircraft did n't deter @entity5 and he completed the jump to raise awareness @entity131 , a charity which helps wounded @entity36 servicemen and women			1
adventure : the intrepid servicemen said that completing the jump was one of the greatest adrenaline rushes of his life mission complete : he finally deployed his parachute 4,000 ft above the ground and safely completed the rest of the descent he said : ' after watching the video of the current record holder , one thought came to mind , i can do better and use the publicity of something like this to raise awareness of what i thought was a well deserving cause - one that had personal meaning to me and many of the people i 've served with in the @entity158 over the years - the @entity131			1
' due to technical difficulties , @entity5 and his team had to switch aircraft at the last minute which resulted in @entity5 having to wait a long and agonising hour before take - off			0
crack team : @entity5 described the team who completed the jump with him as like having a group of @entity113 around him on a basketball court			0

@entity5 leapt from 16,000 ft above @entity91 to complete his stunt
he jumped to raise awareness of charity which helps injured servicemen
