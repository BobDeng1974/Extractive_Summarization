@entity0 believes @entity1 need to sign four new players this summer if they are to challenge for the @entity4 title next season			1
' @entity1 need to buy four players , they need that spine , ' the @entity6 told @entity9			1
' they need a goalkeeper , they still need a centre back , they still need a holding midfielder and , i ’m afraid , they need a top , top - quality striker in order to win this league again			1
' here , @entity23 ’s @entity22 analyses the possible options for @entity1 in key positions			1
@entity1 boss @entity26 will be looking to add to his squad ahead of the 2015 - 16 @entity4 season @entity29 @entity30 @entity31 cost : £ 10million @entity32 says it will cost ' huge money ' for @entity30 who at 32 is still reliable and a calming influence			1
@entity37 remain the front - runners for his signature although @entity40 maintain hope too			1
the figures and @entity30 's age would normally act as a deterrent for the cash - conscious @entity26			1
however , @entity30 's experience could settle an often nervy defence and lift the performance levels of those around him			1
@entity30 looks set to leave @entity31 after losing his no 1 spot to @entity53 goalkeeper @entity52 @entity54 @entity55 cost : £ 12million @entity1 have a keen interest in the 23 - year - old @entity57 under 21 international			1
he already has good experience having made his @entity61 debut against @entity31 in 2011 at 19			0
@entity1 scouts watching his team - mate @entity63 have been impressed and @entity54 is interested in a move			1
his contract runs to 2018 but he said : ' the foreign option is certainly appealing			0
a new language , a new culture - that i could definitely imagine			2
' @entity54 pulls off a brilliant save during @entity55 's 1 - 1 @entity70 draw against @entity71 @entity72 @entity73 cost : £ 16million @entity1 have pondered the experience of @entity76 's @entity75 , the promise of @entity79 's @entity78 but @entity72 at @entity73 keeps cropping up on their scouting lists			1
he is 22 and tipped to become the new @entity82 but @entity1 have watched him for three years now			1
@entity40 have also considered him as have @entity84			0
another option with @entity4 experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is @entity89 of @entity90			2
@entity1 have been scouting 22 - year - old @entity73 goalkeeper @entity72 for the past three years defenders @entity92 @entity93 cost : £ 12million @entity92 has been watched several times by @entity1 scouts			1
the @entity97 international is the subject of interest from @entity84 and they are keen to strike a deal at the end of the season			2
@entity104 and @entity105 have also watched @entity92 after first being alerted when he played for @entity107 alongside @entity108			0
@entity1 though remain unsure @entity92 is for them			2
the @entity109 have been keeping track of @entity92 but the @entity111 is a target for @entity84 @entity113 @entity114 cost : £ 10million the 25 - year - old @entity115 international has not long extended his contract until 2019 but would like to join @entity1 who have had scouts posted at most @entity114 games throughout the season			1
they are well aware of @entity113 , who has over 30 international caps and has progressed from his time at @entity124			0
he is left - sided , has good pace and can pass well			2
he also had the measure of @entity128 at the @entity129 in february			0
@entity130 and @entity131 have checked on him also			0
@entity113 has not long extended his @entity114 deal until 2019 but would like to join @entity1 @entity133 @entity134 cost : £ 8million @entity1 scout @entity135 checked on @entity133 last january as the @entity137 international made his return to fitness from a broken leg he suffered last summer			2
they have maintained their interest in the 27 - year - old who is highly rated by former coach @entity144 at @entity131			0
he is up for sale as @entity134 look to raise funds and has made 23 appearances since december			0
he was sent off in the derby against @entity149 at the weekend and could prove a cheaper back - up option			0
@entity133 ( left ) could be leaving @entity134 as the @entity152 club look to raise funds this summer defensive @entity154 @entity155 @entity114 cost : £ 20million @entity1 are back on the trail of @entity157 after he impressed against them in the @entity61			2
@entity40 have also watched the 22 - year - old @entity6 but @entity26 and @entity61 football will strengthen @entity1 's hand if they choose to step up interest			1
much depends how @entity162 performs between now and the end of the season but @entity155 is a player of great potential			2
@entity114 midfielder @entity155 would give @entity26 an alternative to @entity162 @entity167 @entity168 cost : £ 30million like @entity63 of @entity55 and @entity169 at @entity130 , @entity167 is a player who has been long admired by @entity26			0
he is expected to be the subject of an early summer bid from @entity1			2
@entity168 want him to stay but have already earmarked players to replace him should he go			0
@entity131 , @entity104 and @entity40 have also looked at the 25 - year - old @entity174 international , who is one of the league 's best midfielders			0
@entity167 ( centre ) has long been admired by @entity26 and looks set to leave @entity168 @entity178 @entity179 cost : £ 30million @entity179 do not wish to sell but @entity178 is a player @entity1 like a lot			1
@entity131 's head of recruitment @entity182 also has the @entity184 international high on his wishlist and the north @entity188 neighbours will test @entity179 's resolve as they formalise summer plans			0
@entity178 is still only 24 but has plenty of experience			0
highly regarded by his team - mates and coaches alike , he can also play a more advanced role if required			0
@entity178 celebrates scoring @entity179 's opening goal against @entity104 on sunday @entity198 forwards @entity199 @entity200 cost : £ 20million aggressive , skilful and a goalscorer			0
@entity199 is a handful on and off the pitch but he would give @entity1 an edge they lack			2
he fell out with @entity205 at @entity206 and his relationship with @entity208 has been strained			0
his representatives have already sounded out @entity4 clubs and he seems intent on a move to @entity212			1
@entity26 wanted him last summer but the @entity213 was keen to replace @entity214 at @entity200			0
@entity199 seems intent on a move to @entity212 and @entity26 wanted the striker last summer @entity217 @entity218 cost : £ 25million cash - strapped @entity218 are doing their best to hike up the price of their star striker and he seems intent on leaving with @entity222 and @entity40 also among clubs to have checked on him this season			1
he has 28 goals in 32 games , breaking club records , but has struggled against the top sides			0
still only 23 , @entity217 can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man			0
fits @entity1 's style and life with @entity26 would be a big pull for the ambitious @entity6			2
@entity217 ( right ) has scored 28 goals in 32 games for @entity218 so far this season @entity239 @entity37 cost : £ 35million @entity239 has been looking for a move away from @entity241 for the past year and @entity242 are very keen			1
his representatives held talks with @entity104 last year and he was ready to join prior to @entity246 departing			0
@entity37 do not wish to sell though and @entity1 have been considering other options such as @entity249 's @entity248 , @entity250 at @entity251 and @entity253 's @entity252 , but he is keen to stay in @entity254			1
@entity239 has been looking for a move away from @entity241 and has been linked to @entity1			1

@entity0 wants @entity1 to sign a ' spine ' of top players
@entity1 look set to fall short of challenging for the @entity4 title
the likes of @entity30 could be available come the end of the season
@entity239 is hoping for a move away from @entity37
@entity269 : @entity1 will never be champions with their tippy - tappy football
