by @entity0 published : 21:35 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 05:00 est , 28 december 2012 the @entity1 and @entity2 have finally joined the rest of the @entity4 for a belated @entity6 celebration , after choosing to spend the festive season with the @entity8 instead			1
@entity9 and @entity2 arrived at @entity10 , the @entity12 ’s private estate in @entity13 , early on @entity14 just in time for prince @entity16 ’s annual pheasant shoot			1
it was the first time the @entity2 had been seen in public since she attended her office party before @entity6			2
she was seen going to church with the @entity8 on @entity6 but the @entity21 bizarrely requested that no pictures take of her were published			0
pregnant @entity2 and @entity9 , pictured outside hospital earlier this month , joined the rest of the @entity4 for a belated @entity6 celebration on @entity14 the couple were driven the 155 miles from @entity2 ’s new family home in @entity27 to @entity28 , a journey which takes around three and a half hours , by their @entity32 police protection officers			1
@entity9 , 30 , then joined his grandfather and other relatives for a morning ’s hunting while @entity2 , who is in the early stages of pregnancy , opted to remain at the house with the @entity12 as it was pouring with rain			1
the monarch has herself only just got over a heavy cold			0
but they did join their menfolk for a slap - up lunch at @entity46 , a small lodge on the 20,000 acre estate , for a hearty lunch , chauffeur driven in a fleet of @entity51			1
the meal was laid out in a conservatory area to the rear of the house and included cold meats , soup and flasks of steaming hot toddy , although clearly the @entity60 stuck to soft drinks			0
it is believed that @entity2 may have re-joined the shooting party after lunch , however , watching from the warmth of one of the cars			2
other members of the @entity4 present included the @entity70 and @entity71 , the @entity1 and his daughters , @entity73 and @entity74 , and prince @entity75			0
@entity75 ’s wife , the @entity76 , who has two children and five young grand - children of her own , is believed to have left to spend time with them at her own home in @entity82			0
sources have told the @entity84 that @entity9 and @entity2 stayed at the royal residence overnight after the shoot and are likely to remain on the estate for at least another day before they are expected to fly to @entity88 for the @entity89			1
the @entity12 has a broad smile as she leaves @entity92 church in @entity10 on christmas day , before the @entity1 and @entity2 arrived @entity9 and @entity2 arrived just in time for prince @entity16 's annual pheasant shoot after he missed last year 's due to a blocked coronary artery they tend to celebrate @entity96 at @entity97 , prince @entity75 ’s private estate in the @entity99			1
the couple ’s surprise decision to skip the royals ’ annual get - together in @entity13 in favour of a family @entity6 at the @entity8 ’s new £ 4.85 million mansion in @entity27 was a distinct break with tradition			2
royal aides said the couple had the full backing of both the @entity12 and the @entity16 and suggested that the decision had been taken in order to give @entity2 , who was hospitalised for three nights earlier this month with severe pregnancy - related vomiting and dehydration , the opportunity for a quiet family break			1
they also asked members of the media to respect their privacy and not use any photographs taken of them , even when they attended a public service on christmas day at the @entity8 ’s village church			0
@entity10 in @entity13 where the royal couple attended festive celebrations before flying to @entity88 for @entity89 but the @entity84 now understands that the couple had always planned to spend the festive season with @entity129 and @entity8 at their new home , a @entity132 manor set in extensive grounds			2
this suggests that the @entity135 may join other modern couples in spending alternate christmases with their families in future – one of a series of changes the young windsors are likely to ring in			0
next month @entity21 is to announce whether @entity9 plans to stay in the @entity144 , for whom he works as a @entity146 , after his tour of duty ends in september or leave to become a full - time working royal			2
they are also due to reveal when the @entity151 ’s new son or daughter , who will become third in line to the throne , is due			0
assuming the child was conceived after their return from the @entity159 at the end of september , the child is likely to be born in early summer , a busy time for the couple who will be overseeing the final renovations to @entity166 , their new royal residence in @entity168 .			0
