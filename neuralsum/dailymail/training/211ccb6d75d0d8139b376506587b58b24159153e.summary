@entity0 says @entity1 will again have to prove their resilience to recover from setbacks as they gear up for a week which will define their season			1
the @entity6 failed to show as they were beaten 4 - 1 at @entity7 at the weekend , just 24 hours after manager @entity8 collected the @entity10 prize for november			1
but with a @entity13 quarter - final at @entity14 on wednesday followed by sunday ’s @entity15 , former @entity11 midfielder @entity0 says his new club can ill afford to dwell on the disappointment of the @entity18			1
@entity0 ( left ) vies for possession with @entity20 during his side 's 4 - 1 loss at the @entity18 that result came just 24 hours after @entity8 collected the @entity10 prize for november ‘ it ’s a massive week , ’ said the 25 - year - old , who takes on the @entity11 for the first time since his controversial move between the @entity28 rivals in the summer			1
‘ we have to forget about that performance			0
they out - played us and won all their battles , which was disappointing			2
we were n’t quite at it and were a bit off the pace			0
maybe we did n’t show @entity7 enough respect			2
‘ but these are two massive games now			0
we ’ve got to put things right			0
but we have shown character to bounce back all season , just look at the win we got against @entity44 ( 2 - 1 )			1
’ wednesday ’s game at @entity46 is @entity1 ’s third away tie at top - flight opposition in the competition			1
@entity51 ( left ) bagged a double against the @entity6 including a superb effort in the 58th minute @entity54 also bagged a brace against @entity8 's side and capped off the rout with an audacious penalty @entity60 and @entity61 have already been beaten and , with a place at @entity63 just two rounds away , debate has been raging on @entity65 as to which is the more important game during this coming week			1
@entity8 has insisted that he will be going all out for victory in both , but admits his team need to improve upon their performance at the weekend to stand any chance of winning either			2
‘ we did n’t show our true quality at @entity7 – we ’re better than that , ’ he said			2
@entity0 ( centre ) grapples with @entity44 midfielder @entity76 ( left ) during their clash in december ‘ but the character of this team is never lost			0
we need to stay at the levels we have set , like we did against @entity44			0
‘ it ’s a big week			0
it ’s the third @entity13 away tie we ’ve had now , so we ’ ve done it the hard way but hopefully we can do it again			0
’ @entity1 , meanwhile , are set to allow @entity85 to head out on loan for the remainder of his contract with @entity89 almost certain to terminate his season - long stay as early as next month			1
