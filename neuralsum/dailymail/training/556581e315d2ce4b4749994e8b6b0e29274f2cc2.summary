by @entity0 published : 15:53 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 15:58 est , 3 february 2013 @entity1 has accused @entity2 , the wife of the @entity3 , of adopting a ' cavalier ' attitude after writing an allegedly libellous tweet linking him to false claims of child sex abuse			1
the peer is suing mrs @entity2 for damages of up to £ 50,000 after she tweeted : ' why is @entity1 trending ? * innocent face * ' , after a botched @entity13 investigation claimed an anonymous @entity15 figure had sexually abused boys at a @entity17 care home			1
legal papers obtained by @entity20 also say mrs @entity2 sought to ' trivialise ' the matter and ' added insult to injury ' in later tweets			1
row : @entity1 's legal team say @entity2 was ' cavalier ' with her tweets and also suggest they may have been politically motivated papers lodged at the @entity28 reveal that @entity29 , 43 , did not even watch @entity13 before posting the tweet and did not remove it for a month			1
@entity1 also suggests that her comments had a political motive			2
the @entity33 has already paid @entity34 £ 185,000 in damages and @entity1 's lawyers are now seeking redress from @entity39 users who identified him as the man in the erroneous @entity13 programme			1
outspoken mrs @entity2 has always denied her tweet was libellous , saying it was merely ' foolish '			1
she has instructed @entity46 lawyers @entity47 to represent her			0
a spokesman for the firm said at the time : ‘ @entity1 has issued and served proceedings for libel against @entity2 and we are representing her			2
he put in a claim of £ 50,000			1
’ numerous @entity39 users erroneously linked @entity1 to the @entity13 broadcast			0
for the most part , an apology ended was sufficient to end the matter swiftly deleting abusive tweets may save offenders from being brought before court , the country ’s leading prosecutor said today			2
@entity66 , director of public prosecutions , said it was ' relevant ' for police to consider whether an offending tweet had been quickly deleted			0
speaking to @entity71 ’s @entity70 , he said he was holding a three - month consultation about the plan			0
libellous tweets , or messages which broke court orders or were threatening , would still face prosecution regardless , he added			2
mr @entity66 said : ' there ’s a lot of stuff out there that is highly offensive that is put out on a spontaneous basis that is quite often taken down pretty quickly and the view is that those sort of remarks do n’t necessarily need to be prosecuted			0
' most of the people who tweeted about his involvement have offered the 70 - year - old @entity15 an apology , ending the matter			0
however , he launched legal proceedings after he failed to reach an out - of - court settlement with mrs @entity2			1
the libel battle is expected to go to trial at the @entity28 in the next few months			0
@entity1 's lawyers refer to @entity2 's ' high public and media profile ' , adding : ' the defendant is also politically well connected			1
' she has been a prominent campaigner for the @entity98 and is the wife of the speaker			0
' after the furore surrounding the original tweet , mrs @entity2 posted on @entity39 : ' @entity103 , irresponsible eejit for mentioning fact that he was trending on my timeline			1
' she later posted : ' i guess i 'd better get some legal advice then			0
still maintain was not a libellous tweet — just foolish			2
' she deactivated her @entity39 account in november but then reactivated it nine days later , but still did not delete the original tweet until mid-december			0
neither party was available for comment tonight			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			2

he is suing her for up to £ 50,000 of damages following her *online* comments
legal documents allege her comments were politically motivated
mrs @entity2 has denied her tweets were libellous , just ' foolish '
