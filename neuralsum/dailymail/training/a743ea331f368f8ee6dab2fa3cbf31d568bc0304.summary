back in the days when @entity3 could command £ 200,000 a movie , and her porcelain features granted her access to @entity1 ’s a-list , she never imagined she would end up here			2
‘ @entity12 ’ is the word @entity8 uses to describe the pocket of @entity10 where she now lives with her ten - year - old son @entity11			1
geographically , it ’s not that far from the elegant home which sold for nearly £ 1.7 million in the wake of the toxic break - up from @entity11 ’s father , bafta - nominated composer @entity17 — but it may as well be on another planet			1
the actress — dubbed ‘ @entity21 of the @entity22 ’ by @entity23 whose pictures catapulted her to fame age 16 — trembles as tells of the dramas she ’s encountered since moving here in 2011			1
‘ my house almost burnt down when someone set fire to the roof terrace , and i ’ve had obscenities painted on my door , ’ says @entity8 , now 51			1
it ’s been a bit hairy			2
‘ but even though i ’m small in stature , i stood up to them and told them to take their hoods off when they talked to me			2
i thought , “ i ’m either going to be stabbed or i ’m going to build a relationship ” — and there ’s something to be said for hugging a hoodie			2
‘ they are very respectful to me now , and when i walk down the street they ask , “ how are you today ? ” ‘ at first it was terrifying , but i feel safe here now			2
there ’s a real sense of community , and what i see are young people who ’ve been badly let down by society and just need a chance			0
’ besides , the three - storey ‘ wreck ’ @entity8 has transformed into a little oasis of loveliness in this yet - to - be gentrified urban desert of predominantly social housing , certainly beats being homeless — a state which @entity8 claims to have had some experience			1
this week , the twice - divorced actress , who appeared in @entity78 ’s @entity77 in 1992 and with @entity79 in @entity80 the following year , revealed she was left ‘ homeless and on welfare ’ for a while as a result of expensive divorces and the acrimonious break - up from @entity17 , who			1
the last was a particularly toxic public split , marred by bitter accusations which left both sides deeply wounded			0
in 2011 , @entity17 was cleared in court of assaulting @entity92 — an experience he described as a ‘ kafkaesque nightmare ’ which left his ‘ good reputation shredded ’			0
meanwhile , @entity8 furiously denied @entity17 ’s claims that she ’d cheated on him with a mutual friend , denouncing the accusation ‘ cowardly ’ and ‘ disgusting ’			1
for months , @entity8 refused to budge from the family home , while @entity17 was displaced from the house he owned			1
when it was finally sold and the assets frozen while lawyers tried to thrash out an agreement , @entity8 ’s purchase of a new flat fell through			1
for three months , she lived with @entity11 in a friend ’s spare room			1
unable to work , she says at one point they existed on just £ 75 a week and owed lawyers almost £ 20,000			0
her weight dropped to six stones			0
‘ it ’s one thing to be broke when you only have yourself to worry about , but quite another when you have a child , ’ she says			0
i think i lived on nothing but courgettes and feta cheese for three months			0
‘ after dinner with friends , i would clear the plates and secretly finish the left - overs in the kitchen because i was so hungry			2
i was too proud to ask for hand - outs			2
’ today , after a year of therapy and three years of soul - searching , @entity8 blames no one but herself — with the exception , perhaps , of lawyers , who she believes turned a bitter break - up into a war			1
she declares it a ‘ bloody miracle ’ that she and @entity17 are now on speaking terms			0
they both adore their son , and have put aside their differences to work together as parents for @entity11 ’s benefit			1
as the main breadwinner in her two failed marriages , she says she lost half her assets in the divorces ; but as an unmarried partner , she had hardly any rights			0
‘ i call that whole period “ nut-gate ” because it all went bonkers for a while , ’ she says			0
it was the height of the fury and upset that goes on when people are splitting up — and it was pretty bloody			0
’ the twice - divorced actress , who appeared in @entity78 ’s @entity77 in 1992 and with @entity79 ( pictured ) in @entity80 the following year she concedes that @entity17 was the main breadwinner , who bought their home and paid most bills			1
@entity8 says she may not have put anything financially into the property , but she still invested in the relationship			1
‘ the money i earned went towards us having a very nice life together			0
i cooked , cleaned , cared for our son who was very ill with juvenile arthritis			2
‘ there was a lot of hurt , a lot of anger , but since then @entity17 has been a model father			0
he has acted honourably and done more financially than any judge ever would have ordered			0
‘ i ’m a real advocate for people getting off their butts and working , but as a mother i ca n’t just take off for weeks to film a series			0
’ on the wall of @entity8 ’s kitchen is pinned the famous @entity23 portrait which turned her into a star			1
she looks incredibly pretty , but all @entity8 can see is a young woman full of insecurity			1
the only child of late actor @entity188 and his beautiful actress wife @entity189 , who died two years ago , @entity8 ’s parents split up when she was eight years old			1
she hardly saw her father after the break - up , and witnessed the descent of her adored mother into manic depression and schizophrenia			2
@entity8 says she has been searching all her life to create the perfect family she never had			1
at 24 , she fell in love with @entity200 - born actor and arts administrator @entity201 , and they moved to the @entity203 just as @entity8 ’s career took off , @entity201 gave up his job to become a painter			1
they wed in 1991 , but it ended when @entity8 fell for married director @entity209 , whom she met on the set of 1995 ’s @entity211 and ms @entity212			1
@entity8 remains consumed with guilt over her affair with @entity209 , the father of two young sons			1
‘ i split up @entity23 ’s marriage and i am so ashamed of that			1
i started paying his wife alimony of $ 5,000 a month as i felt so guilty			0
i should never have even started that relationship , let alone married him			0
’ again , @entity8 claims she was the main breadwinner — taking on awful acting jobs to maintain their lifestyle			2
they married in 1999 , but divorced in 2003			0
@entity8 pictured here with her former husband @entity17 in 2004			2
they have now put their differences aside and work together to look after their ten - year - old son @entity11 ‘ i ’ve been absolutely devastated by every single relationship in one way or another , ’ she says			1
from now on , she is determined to break the destructive pattern			0
she is also branching out professionally , and has formed a production company , @entity234 , with friend @entity235			0
deals for two major dramas have already been signed			0
but she admits that without an inheritance from her mother , she ’d be ‘ stacking shelves in @entity241 ’			0
‘ it has been a fight to get back on our feet , ’ says @entity8 , who has a new boyfriend but will say nothing other than that he is younger than her and has ‘ a proper job ’			2
‘ i ’ve not had a great time , but no one need feel sorry for me			0
i am happy and genuinely fulfilled			0
