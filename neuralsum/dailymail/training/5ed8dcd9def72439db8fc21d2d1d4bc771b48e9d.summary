@entity63 , centre manager , said : ' we are not sure how he received his injuries			2
either he got caught in thick wire or , what we think is more likely the case , he has been used as a bait dog			1
' i 'm not sure why such a dog would have been used for dog baiting			2
he would be quite expensive to buy , which would suggest he may well have been bred for that or stolen			0
the bulldog - pug cross , pictured with vet @entity78 at @entity79 , has to wear bandages on all four of his legs ' so far we have not had anybody come forward to claim hero , but we 've had plenty of phone calls to say they will home him			1
' but we ca n't do that yet because we have to get him back to full health first			0
in the meantime we need to raise money to pay for the vet 's bills , which will likely be in excess of £ 2 , 000			2

he is walking so we expect him to do well			0
the hope for @entity51 in the future is that he will find a loving home			2

it is possible that he was somebody 's pet because of his breed but nobody has reported him missing and he is not micro chipped			0
' ms @entity63 added : ' hero will have an operation at the end of this week			1
in cases such as this , the flesh is so badly damaged it starts to die off			1
this is why @entity51 will need his operation			0

he will need regular vet trips after everything he has gone through			0
