by @entity0 published : 22:15 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 23:56 est , 11 april 2013 @entity1 is making thousands of dollars by selling art that she continues to make from behind bars but now that @entity5 has banned her from their site , she is relying on a loyal group of friends who are running a different website for the sales			1
the fact that she and her family members were profiting from the notoriety she earned from the killing of her ex boyfriend @entity1 has not stopped apparent fans from shelling out over $ 3,000 for a piece of @entity20 ' artwork			1
earlier today , her mother confirmed that the colored pencil drawings made by @entity20 were being sold through a third party			2
when asked if the drawings - consisting of portraits of unidentified women or famous dead celebrities like @entity29 and @entity30 - were selling , @entity24 said : ' oh yea			1
' seizing opportunities : @entity1 is trading on the notoriety of her name to help earn thousands from supporters on the auction block : her @entity30 portrait ( left ) was the highest earner so far , with a final price tag of $ 3,050 while ' @entity40 ' ( right ) sold for $ 1,525 this comes on the same day that a friend of the suspected murderer admitted that she was posting messages to @entity45 on behalf of @entity20 as she remains behind bars during her trial			1
her friend @entity48 told a local @entity50 affiliate that she and the 32 - year - old accused killer speak by phone most nights and discuss different parts of the day 's court dealings			2
' she 'll call and say " i have a quote			0
" we 'll talk about it			0
sometimes she says " let 's tweet			2
" and then she 'll say " no let 's not do it , " ' ms @entity60 told @entity62			2
' i think it 's a way of her getting out her frustration , because she does n't have a chance to say much			0
' in the 20 tweets that they have posted as of thursday night , the duo - or simply ms @entity60 - have gone after the critics on the internet and on the airwaves			0
@entity75 and others at @entity78 's @entity77 , which they said was ' an acronym for @entity80 '			0
a consistent theme of the tweets , however , has been the promotion of her website where she is now selling the artwork that she makes behind bars			1
all four pieces that have already been sold all went for $ 1,000 or more , with her portrait of @entity30 earning a whopping $ 3,050			0
' catharsis ' : this monochromatic work sold for $ 1,000 silver lining ? @entity20 , speaking through her friend with access to social media , said that the @entity5 ban did n't hurt sales promotion : the drawing sales are supposedly helping fund her family 's stay in @entity103 during the trial self aware : @entity20 supporters are the ones in charge of her website and @entity45 feed ' @entity5 has banned all listings of my artwork			1
the silver lining in making my art more difficult to obtain is that it keeps increasing in value , ' ms @entity60 wrote on the @entity45 in february			1
blue eyes : this portrait of @entity29 sold for $ 1,075 the money earned through the pictures and the donations accrued on her website is all said to be going towards the expenses of her relatives who have been a constant presence in the @entity129 courtroom as they have uprooted from their @entity131 hometown for the duration			1
though technically neither her communication via ms @entity60 and their @entity45 feed nor her shipment of the artwork to a third party for sale are illegal , they are both frowned upon by the sheriff 's office			1
' this does n't sit well with us , ' sergeant @entity144 from the @entity145 told @entity146			0
' she could draw those pictures , but i ca n't tell you whether they are truly hers or whether this is someone trying to make money off her			0
' many pundits have likened the dramatics surrounding her case to that of @entity160 , and the questions raised about income revenue streams is also similar in the two cases			0
in @entity165 , @entity164 is currently involved in a new legal battle as concerned public opposition groups are fighting to prevent her from selling the story of her daughter 's death for a profit			2
there have not been any formal petitions put into place in the @entity20 case to stop her from trading on her now - infamous name , and the next step in the trial comes on friday when psychotherapist @entity183 returns to the stand .			0
