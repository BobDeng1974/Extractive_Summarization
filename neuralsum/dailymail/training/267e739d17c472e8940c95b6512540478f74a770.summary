a new road has been unveiled in the @entity1 that could change the way we drive in future			1
this is n’t just a regular road – it ’s a proof of concept for @entity10 ’s innovative ‘ @entity11 ’ design			1
using glow - in - the - dark paint , it could lead to interactive and sustainable roads without streetlights			1
now it ’s been deployed on a 0.3 - mile ( 500 metres ) section of the @entity33 road near @entity34 , @entity1			1
and , if it proves successful , their ‘ @entity11 ’ could soon be making its way to a road near you			0
with many energy - conscious governments switching off streetlights , this technology could be a green solution to lighting our roads			1
special lines are painted along the sides of roads			0
these lines contain a ‘ photo - luminising ’ powder that charges in the day			1
at night , the powder releases a green glow			1
after absorbing daylight the paint can glow for up to ten hours , all through the hours of darkness			1
the lines are bright enough that future roads could use them in place of streetlights			2
it absorbs sunlight in the day and releases it at night , providing drivers with clear markings on where to go			0
the company says the paint is a sustainable alternative to modern roads			0
this particular test is a pilot project for the technology			0
ultimately , they say the same paint could be used to make interactive roads			2
for example , weather symbols could be painted on the road that appear when the temperature reaches a certain level			0
and @entity81 , in collaboration with @entity83 , also has plans for other functionality including priority lanes that indicate when and where cars should change lanes			2
the technology has now been rolled out on a section of the @entity33 road near @entity34 in the @entity1 , but the company hopes it could be deployed internationally soon if the pilot proves successful the stretch of road near @entity34 is not glowing as brightly as was hoped as it has been found that moisture affects the glow - in - the - dark paint , pictured here glowing at optimum levels the technology is currently being tested on a 0.3 - mile ( 500 metres ) stretch of the @entity33 near @entity34 despite teething problems , it is hoped that the powder technology within the paint could be used to make road markings that change according to the temperature , giving drivers live weather reports that could warn them of icy roads @entity10 's plans for interactive roads also include lanes where electric cars could be charged the designer behind the project , @entity118 , is notorious for his somewhat wacky designs including the dress that turns transparent when it detects you 're aroused , as recently reported by @entity122			1
‘ instead of focusing on the car to innovate the driving experience , @entity118 and @entity125 are innovating the highway , ’ the companies say in a release			0
‘ innovative designs such as the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 will be realized within the following five years			0
‘ the goal is to make roads that are more sustainable and interactive by using interactive lights , smart energy and road signs that adapt to specific traffic situations			0
’ while the paint is designed to a small section of road in the @entity1 for now , the companies hope to roll it out internationally			0
dynamic lines could be used to tell you when you can overtake and when you should stay in lane @entity10 also has plans for interactive lights that only turn on when they detect cars			2

@entity1 company has begun testing their glow - in - the - dark roads
@entity10 ’s technology uses ' photo - luminising ' powder
lines containing the powder are painted along the side of roads
@entity164 absorbs daylight and then releases it for up to ten hours at night
enables roads to be lit sustainably without the use of streetlights
same technology could be used to build interactive roads in the future
could show you the weather , when to change lanes and charge your car
