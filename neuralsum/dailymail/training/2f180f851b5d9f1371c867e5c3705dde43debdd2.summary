despite the pride of @entity2 being at stake , no local players were to be found in the matchday squad for the derby on sunday			1
the startling statistic is perhaps more common in modern football , and was based upon the 36 @entity9 and @entity10 players listed for the game at the @entity12			1
there were only eight englishmen in total with zero @entity16 , and six @entity17 selected			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity19 and @entity20 were part of a five - strong @entity17 contingent in the @entity2 derby @entity24 was the most ' local ' man on show , having been born in @entity27 @entity28 ( right ) is a @entity29 but joined @entity30 in the summer , while @entity31 has also left 8 - @entity32 6 - @entity17 4 - @entity33 , @entity34 3 - @entity35 2 - @entity36 , @entity37 1 - @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity47 and @entity48 made up the contingent from @entity17 , while @entity24 was the most ' local ' from either 18 - man squad , having been raised in @entity27			1
@entity28 was one player who were most renowned with representing @entity2 in the derby , but has now have moved on			0
@entity10 's @entity52 is @entity2 born and bred but was surprisingly overlooked for the game , something @entity55 may have regretted after @entity56 's sending off			0
speaking before the game , @entity52 told @entity10 's club website : as one of the more local lads , i know what this club means			0
' ' do n't get me wrong , the foreign players know @entity10 as well but being a local lad gives you extra incentive to do well			2
