by @entity0 last updated at 1:45 am on 4th august 2011 ailing : @entity1 lies on a bed in a steel cage inside the court room in @entity5 as he faces charges of corruption and ordering the deaths of protesters six months ago he ruled @entity10 with absolute power			1
yesterday @entity1 was in a cage , wheeled into court on a hospital trolley , broken and humiliated , to face an extraordinary show trial			1
the 83 - year - old , who is said to have stomach cancer , denied charges of corruption and complicity in the killing of protesters			2
beside him at a @entity5 police academy converted into a court for the trial stood his two sons , their hair cropped and wearing white prison uniforms which matched their father ’s			1
it was the first time @entity10 have seen @entity1 , who has been under hospital arrest in the @entity33 resort of @entity34 , since he gave a defiant tv address refusing to resign before he was forced from office in february			2
they watched him live on state tv yesterday , many savouring the downfall of the man who ruled them , often brutally , with unquestioned power for 29 years			0
there had been widespread scepticism that @entity10 ’s new military rulers would ever allow @entity1 to stand trial – one of the key demands which has united protesters since he fell following an 18 - day uprising			1
‘ this is the dream of @entity10 , to see him like this , humiliated like he humiliated them for the last 30 years , ’ said @entity51 , the mother of a 17 - year - old girl in the city of @entity54 who was shot dead during the crackdown			0
‘ i want to see their hearts explode like my daughter ’s heart exploded from their single bullet , ’ she sobbed			0
in the courtroom protected by 3,000 soldiers and police , a prosecutor read the charges against @entity1 – that he was an accomplice along with his then - interior minister in the ‘ intentional and premeditated murder of peaceful protesters ’ – and that he and his sons received gifts from a prominent businessman in return for guaranteeing him a lowered price in a land deal with the state			1
repercussions : the former leader , who held power for nearly 30 years , has not been seen since he was deposed in february unprecedented : security is extremely tight at the trial in @entity5 , with steps taken to prevent missiles being thrown into the cage caged : @entity1 can be seen in his bed on the left of the image , flanked by his two sons @entity92 and @entity93 @entity95 appearance : @entity1 was flown by helicopter from @entity34 yesterday morning ‘ yes , i am here , ’ @entity1 said softly from his bed , raising his hand slightly when the judge asked him to identify himself and enter a plea			1
‘ i deny all these accusations completely , ’ he said into a microphone , wagging his finger			0
the charge of ordering the killing of protesters – 850 died during the uprising – carries the death penalty			1
although pale , his eyes ringed with red , the man who survived several assassination attempts to become the region ’s power broker appeared alert and aware of what was going on			0
he showed little discernible emotion , occasionally pulling a white sheet up to his chin			0
flanking him in the cage were his nine co-defendants			0
as well as his sons – one - time heir apparent @entity92 and wealthy businessman @entity93 – his former interior minister @entity121 and six top former police officials are accused			0
highly anticipated : @entity1 abiout to be led from a van outside the court			2
he faces charges of corruption and ordering the killing of protesters during the uprising in february clashes : @entity134 and @entity135 supporters were involved in scuffles outside the courtroom unrest : @entity139 supporters have threatened to burn down any prison the former leader is put in jubilant : a protester against @entity10 's former president @entity1 holds a flag and flicks a v for victory hand gesture outside the police academy where the trial is taking place from time to time , @entity1 craned his neck to see the proceedings and at other times , he crooked his elbow over his face as if in exhaustion			1
while the other defendants sat on wooden benches in the cage , @entity92 and @entity157 stood next to their father ’s bed , at one point with their arms crossed on their chest seemingly trying to block the court camera ’s view of their father			0
the two sons each carried a copy of the @entity172 and leaned over to talk to their father			0
emotions were high outside the court where a crowd of @entity1 supporters and hundreds of relatives of dead protesters and other @entity1 opponents massed at the gates , scuffling sporadically as they watched the proceedings on a giant screen			1
divisions : an @entity10 man loyal to the former president throws a stone at a foe outside the police academy where the trial is taking place fighting : supporters @entity1 clash with an @entity135 protester , centre , outside the court room during the first day of the former president 's trial emotions running high : the clash continues between pro- and @entity135 demonstrators with the men wielding makeshift weapons the pain is not yet over : an injured man is carried away during clashes between supporters of @entity10 's ousted president @entity1 and anti-mubarak protesters scores to settle : unidentified protesters throw rocks as they clash with others , as one holds a photograph , right , of a man killed during the uprising in february they threw stones and bottles at each other while riot police with shields and helmets tried to keep them apart			1
fifty supporters pounded on the steel gate trying to get into the compound , chanting ‘ we love you , @entity1 ! ’ until police charged at them with electrified batons and dispersed them			2
the courtroom itself was divided			0
relatives of the defendants sat near the cage			0
a fence running through the middle of the chamber divided them from the rest of the audience of around 300 people , including a few relatives of protesters killed in the uprising , kept far enough that they can not shout or throw anything at the former leader			2
the trial was adjourned until august 15			0
@entity1 will be held at a military hospital on the outskirts of @entity5			2
flashback : @entity1 was ousted from power after 18 days of violent protests centred around @entity250 , in @entity5 , as well as other cities public anger : a man walks past a defaced statue of the former leader			1
@entity1 has been in @entity34 since he was deposed in february backlash : hundreds of protesters were killed during violent clashes in february , but eventually @entity1 was forced to stand down as thousands descended on his palace			1

@entity1 flanked by sons during trial in police academy named in his honour
violent clashes between rival supporters outside @entity5 court
former leader could face death penalty over ordering the killing of hundreds of protesters during february uprising
he ' denies all charges and accusations ' put to him
