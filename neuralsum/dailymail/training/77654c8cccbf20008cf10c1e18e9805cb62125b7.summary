when the leaders of the @entity10 nations gather at @entity11 tomorrow , mrs @entity7 will treat their spouses to a tour of the @entity2 and a meal made from produce grown in her @entity2 vegetable garden			1
then leaders and spouses will de-camp to @entity20 for the largest @entity21 in the organisation 's history – some 60 countries will be represented			1

touchdown : @entity31 arrives at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 with @entity6 president @entity1 during last year ’s @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity6 , it was a pregnant @entity38 who received the wives , and one husband , of the heads of states and governments			1
this time in @entity44 and @entity20 all eyes will be on @entity31			2

she is best known as a political writer at the magazine @entity51 , where she has worked for two decades			2
when she appeared for her boyfriend ’s swearing in at the @entity54 , clad in a black chiffon dress , nude tights , high heels and white coat , she drew comment for outshining the relatively dowdy @entity60			2
when the wind caught her split skirt to reveal an eye - catching glimpse of thigh , it was clear that the @entity60 era was over every bit as much as the @entity38 one following @entity71 ’s defeat by the socialist @entity1			2
although @entity7 was a high - powered lawyer and hospital executive in @entity20 and understands the pressure of juggling work and family life , her background is very different from that of @entity31			2

married just once , with two daughters rather than four sons , mrs @entity7 ’s life has been a model of stability compared to @entity31 ’s			2
it remains to be seen whether mrs @entity7 will miss @entity60 , whom she bonded with so strongly that she apparently felt comfortable enough to confide that she found life in the @entity2 ‘ hell ’ – though aides on both sides of the @entity102 denied she ever said this			0
mrs @entity7 and @entity31 share humble beginnings			0

mrs @entity7 once confronted black talk show host @entity133 after he had moderated a debate to demand : ‘ why are you messing with @entity0 ? ' ‘ you were unfairly tough on @entity0			0
you should know as a black man what he ’s up against and what he ’s trying to do			0
’ during the @entity6 election , @entity31 was dubbed ‘ the @entity143 ’ because of her use of @entity141 to deliver frequent barbs			1
she has also hit back at the way she has been portrayed			0
when her own magazine put her on the cover with the headline ‘ @entity1 's @entity151 ’ , she tweeted : ‘ @entity152 for its sexism , my thoughts go out to all angry women ’			0
after a @entity156 reporter ’s book recounted disputes inside the @entity2 involving a feisty and impatient first lady , mrs @entity7 gave a television interview protesting about being characterised as an ‘ angry black woman ’			0
@entity38 ( left ) , wife of former @entity6 president @entity162 , is greeted by @entity80 first lady @entity7 ( right ) at the @entity163 in 2009 the two husbands may have got off to a rocky start , as mr @entity1 confirmed that @entity6 would withdraw from the @entity80 - led war in @entity167 by the end of the year			1
the announcement was apparently no surprise to mr @entity0 , who nodded along but did not otherwise respond to the news			0
mr @entity1 insisted : ' we will continue to support @entity167 in a different way			1
our support will take a different format			0
' i 'm pretty sure i will find the right means so that our allies can continue with their mission and at the same time i can comply to the promise i made to the @entity6 people			1
' the declaration means that means @entity6 , one of the top contributors of troops to the war , will be removing the combat forces a full two years before the timeline agreed to by allies in the coalition			1
that could shift more of the burden to those allies and give them reason to hasten their own exit			0
@entity1 later told reporters that some ' residual ' number of @entity6 's current 3,300 troops will remain in @entity167 after this year to provide training and to bring home equipment .			1

leaders could clash over @entity6 plan to withdraw troops from @entity167
