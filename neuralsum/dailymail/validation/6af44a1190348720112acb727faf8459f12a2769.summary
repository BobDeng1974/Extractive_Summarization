@entity0 rounded on more than 100 of @entity2 's top business leaders today after they backed the @entity4 ' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a ' change of course '			1
in a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election , the business chiefs claimed a @entity0 government would ' put the recovery at risk '			2
but @entity14 said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the @entity17 were on the side of ' a few big firms and individuals at the top '			1
shadow business secretary @entity22 , meanwhile , dismissed the signatories as a ' cosy little club ' , while @entity0 peer @entity25 went further criticising them as ' tax dodgers , @entity4 voters and non-doms '			1
the business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as @entity38 , @entity46 , @entity43 and @entity39			1
executives at consumer brands such as @entity44 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 are also on the list			2
embarrassingly for @entity0 , the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of @entity66 and @entity67			2
however , mr @entity14 said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election			1
he said : ' businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and , you know , that does n't surprise me			0
' but it does also go to the wider choice at this election			0
the conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well , the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else			0
' we have tried that experiment over the last few years and it has n't worked			0
we have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work			0
i just have a different view about the way the country succeeds			0
' mr @entity22 went further dismissed it as a ' letter organised by the @entity4 in a conservative - supporting newspaper ' after it was first published in the @entity98			1
but mr @entity47 , touring @entity100 's brewery in the @entity101 today , said the letter from business leaders was ' very powerful '			1
@entity47 and @entity104 visited @entity100 in @entity101 today on the second full day of the general election campaign mr @entity47 said the letter from business leaders was ' very powerful ' while the chancellor claimed it was ' unprecedented ' @entity4 officials said the number of signatories to the open letter ( above ) made it ' unprecedented ' in the history of @entity2 general elections he said : ' today it is an unprecedented intervention by some of the business leaders in the best - known business , large and small , in our country saying the @entity4 long - term plan is working , generating jobs			1
' that is a very clear message from business leaders who , like me , care about jobs and wealth creation and prosperity and livelihoods in our country			0
' chancellor @entity104 added : ' the warning from @entity2 's business leaders could n't be clearer : a change of course will threaten jobs , deter investment , send a negative signal about our country and put the recovery at risk			0
' deputy pm @entity142 said the letter was a tribute to the work of the @entity147 government , and claimed an outright @entity4 win would ‘ pose a very real threat ’ to @entity2 ’s stability			1
the @entity164 leader said yesterday : ‘ i read the letter carefully , it talks about what this coalition government has done , and i think the signatories to the letter are completely right in saying that about the last thing that this country needs , now that we ’re emerging from this long shadow of the economic crash in 2008 , is a great lurch in one direction or another			2
' however , the @entity167 dem business secretary @entity166 said the signatories were ' not exactly representative ' of the business community and should ' be careful what they wish for ' , accusing some of signing up ' naively ' to a @entity4 stunt			1
the business leaders were particularly positive about mr @entity104 's strategy of seeking to encourage investment by slashing corporation tax , which fell to 20 per cent this week , having stood at 28 per cent when the government came to power in 2010			1
' @entity47 and @entity104 's flagship policy of progressively lowering corporation tax to 20 per cent has been very important in showing the @entity2 is open for business			1
it has been a key part of their economic plan , ' the business leaders said in the letter			2
' the result is that @entity2 grew faster than any other major economy last year and businesses like ours have created over 1.85million new jobs			0
' the list of signatories includes senior executives of nine ftse 100 companies			2
it includes senior figures such as @entity197 , chairman of @entity198			0
the list includes five signatories who previously supported @entity0 including sir @entity202 , chairman of @entity203 and @entity204 , who signed a letter backing the party before the 2005 election			2
@entity209 star @entity208 , who unveiled a ' seaside manifesto ' with @entity67 before the 2010 general election , is also a signatory			0
@entity14 , speaking at engineering company @entity213 in @entity214 today , provoked another row with business by proposing further restrictions on zero - hours contracts the @entity0 leader took a selfie taken with a worker as he arrives for a @entity223 session at the factory in @entity214 former @entity226 chief @entity225 warned last night the @entity0 's plan to raise corporation tax would ' choke off the recovery '			1
@entity230 yesterday confirmed @entity0 will raise corporation tax for the first time in 40 years , despite warnings it could cost more than 100,000 jobs			0
the cash will be used to fund a £ 400 cut in business rates for smaller firms			0
but lord @entity225 said : ' the more i hear from @entity0 , the more concerned i become			0
they do n't get business			0
' @entity0 talk a lot about spending money – but what about earning it ? @entity14 and @entity230 seem intent on pitting small businesses against large businesses , saddling the engine rooms of our country with higher corporation taxes and crippling entrepreneurs – all of which would choke off the recovery			2
