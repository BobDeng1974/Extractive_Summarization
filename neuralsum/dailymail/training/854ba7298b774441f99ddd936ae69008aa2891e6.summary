@entity9 - alongside son @entity8 , who is chairman - has presided over the worst year in the club ’s recent history			2
there have been major disputes with @entity14 over transfer policy and the new manager could have lost his job on a number of occasions since taking over before pre-season			0

but @entity0 , now 80 , refutes the claims			1
‘ it ’s simply not true we have asset stripped or misappropriated football generated funds , ’ he told the @entity36			0
‘ if those responsible for these allegations had examined the accounts of the football group they would have seen we had been building up substantial assets to strengthen and secure the football club over 27 years , protecting the club from debt and producing revenue income and more recently substantial profits for the football group			1
‘ we are one of the few clubs in the football world that have no debts and are in profit			0
’ the reason they have no debts , of course , is the overt unwillingness to compete on a financial level with the rest of the second tier in the transfer market			0

to sum up the lack of pride , a sign reading : ‘ @entity108 of @entity109 ( sic ) ’ has not been removed , remaining at front of house for years			0
while supporters have always accepted the @entity33 run the club differently to the rest of the @entity118 , the alarming figures released through the family ’s various accounts have created a swell of ill - feeling			1
