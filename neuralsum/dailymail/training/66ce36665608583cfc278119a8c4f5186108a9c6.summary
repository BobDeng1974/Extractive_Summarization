outspoken former @entity1 mep @entity0 has quit the party – claiming it is now too politically correct			1
mr @entity0 , a former flat mate of @entity4 , said he was leaving with a ‘ heavy heart ’ but had ‘ had enough ’ after being banned from speaking because of his controversial views			1
he left with a warning for @entity1 ’s first elected mp @entity8 that he could be knifed in the back by his new party if he was not careful			1
mr @entity0 , who represented @entity11 and the @entity12 for @entity1 in the @entity13 for 10 years , added : ‘ @entity8 , watch your back			1
you believe in libertarianism – do n’t be pushed off			2
‘ @entity26 in mind we started in 2009 in @entity29 with 13 meps and we ended up with five , so there are dead @entity1 bodies all over the place with knives quivering in their back so make sure it ’s not yours			2
’ the former @entity17 , who was first elected to @entity36 in 2004 , said : ‘ i was a founding member of @entity1 and i ’ve been a significant donor			1
‘ but now i find that instead of being the libertarian party , the party of common sense , i ’ve been banned from speaking			2
‘ so , yes , it ’s a very sad day for me			0
but the party seems to have gone astray			0
’ he added : ‘ quite what ’s going on i could n’t say , but i ’ve had enough			0
‘ what kind of party are we supposed to be ? the while point and the reason we are doing so well is because we were supposed to something different			0
‘ we seem to be drifting towards the politically correct mainstream like everybody else			0
‘ i ’ve had enough of party politics			0
i do n’t think party politics is for people who tell it like it is			0
’ mr @entity0 sparked controversy in 2012 after complaining that foreign aid is sent to ‘ @entity60 ’			1
it came after he sparked accusations of sexism after saying : ‘ i just do n’t think they clean behind the fridge enough ’ - a notorious comment that indirectly led to his downfall when female @entity1 activists declared they were too busy to ‘ clean behind the fridge ’ mr @entity0 told a fringe meeting at the party ’s 2012 conference : ‘ the room is full of sluts ! ’ @entity8 was today sworn in as @entity1 's first elected mp after holding his seat of @entity77 last week @entity1 leader @entity4 ( centre ) and newly elected @entity1 mp @entity8 ( right ) were joined by their party 's candidate @entity79 on @entity82 , @entity83 , last week the remark was meant as a joke but provoked a media storm , particularly as mr @entity0 then hit mr @entity87 over the head with a @entity1 conference programme outside the fringe event in a row about racism			1
@entity93 party leader @entity4 said mr @entity0 ’s antics had ‘ destroyed ’ coverage of the party ’s annual conference , and he was suspended from the party just two hours after giving his keynote address as @entity1 ’s defence spokesman			1
in the past @entity1 has delighted in being politically incorrect			2
but the leadership is trying to adopt a more serious image in the run - up to next year ’s general elections .			0
