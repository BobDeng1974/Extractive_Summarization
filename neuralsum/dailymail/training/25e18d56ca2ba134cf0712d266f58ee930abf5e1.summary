@entity0 took us on a roller coaster ride last year when it swung perilously close to the sun. scientists all over the world were on the edge of their seats , urging the comet to survive its close encounter			1
but the optimistically - named ' comet of the century ' was pronounced dead in december causing astronomers to mourn the loss of the sky show that once promised to light up @entity14			1
now @entity0 could have another trick up its sleeve			0
scientists believe an unusual meteor shower from the comet could hit @entity14 tonight			1
according to his computer models , the debris stream is populated with extremely tiny grains of dust , no more than a few microns wide			2
pushed toward @entity14 by the gentle radiation pressure of the sun , they will be hitting at a speed of 125,000 mph ( 56 km / s )			1
because the particles are so small , @entity14 ’s upper atmosphere will rapidly slow them to a stop			1
scientists now believe an unusual meteor shower from comet @entity0 could hit @entity14 tonight			1
this image shows the position of the radiant for any possible @entity0 debris in @entity46 in this frame grab taken from an enhanced video made by @entity51 's @entity50 - a spacecraft , comet @entity0 , left , approaches the sun on november 25 scientist at the @entity55 station are currently in place to gather any dust from the comet @entity0 to help them find the ' basic building blocks ' of life			1
dust gathering can take place the @entity55 because the air over the polar continent is cleaner compared to more inhabited locations			1
the scientists plan to use five 150 - square metre polyethylene canvases as traps			2
each trap will be unrolled and left in the hope that some comet particulates would fall on it			0
then they will be preserved in chemically inert argon gas and shipped to @entity74 for microscopic study , which is expected to start in may			0
‘ instead of burning up in a flash of light , they will drift gently down to the @entity14 below , ’ said professor @entity22			2
scientists are unsure exactly when or if the meteor shower will happen , but have estimated that it may reach its peak tonight			2
the invisible rain of comet dust , if it occurs , would be very slow			2
it can take months or even years for fine dust to settle out of the high atmosphere			1
but while the dust is in the atmosphere it could produce noctilucent clouds ( @entity93 )			1
nlcs are icy clouds that glow electric - blue as they float more than 80 km above @entity14 's poles			1
data from @entity51 ’s @entity99 spacecraft suggests that @entity93 are seeded by space dust			0
tiny meteoroids act as nucleating points where water molecules gather ; the resulting ice crystals assemble into clouds at the edge of space itself			2
this is still speculative , but @entity0 could provide the seeds for a noctilucent display			0
electric - blue ripples over @entity14 's polar regions might be the only visible sign that a shower is underway			1
ahile the dust is in the atmosphere it could produce noctilucent clouds such as the ones seen here @entity0 , which has been dubbed the ' comet of the century ' , was visible to the naked eye in november @entity0 headed towards the centre of our solar system in novermber passing within 1.2 million miles of the sun ’s surface			1
at the time of discovery in september 2012 , @entity0 was over 584 million miles from the sun. its average speed in july was 55,405mph			0
it continued to accelerate steadily until november when it whipped around the sun at an astonishing 425,000mph			0
after much speculation , the optimistically - named ‘ comet of the century ’ was pronounced dead in december after its close encounter with our star			0
astronomers who had followed the ice ball mourned the loss of the sky show that once promised to light up during december			0
scientists now believe an unusual meteor shower from the comet 's remains could hit @entity14 tonight			1
professor @entity22 notes another strange event : ‘ the shower is going to hit our planet from two directions at once			0
’ when @entity14 passes through the debris stream , we will encounter two populations of comet dust			1
one swarm of dust will be following the @entity0 into the sun. another swarm will be moving in the opposite direction , pushed away from the sun by solar radiation pressure			0
the streams will pepper opposite sides of @entity14 simultaneously			2
‘ in my experience , this kind of double whammy is unprecedented , ’ he said			0
@entity168 , lead scientist at @entity51 ’s @entity169 , added there 's little danger to @entity14 - orbiting spacecraft			2
‘ these particles are just too small to penetrate the walls of our satellites , and they do n't stand a chance against the heavy shielding of the @entity179 ’ however , he adds , mission operators will be alert this week for possible anomalies			0
scientist at the @entity55 station are already in place to gather any dust from the comet @entity0 to help them find the ' basic building blocks ' of life			1
noctilucent clouds ( @entity93 ) are icy clouds that glow electric - blue as they float more than 80 km above @entity14 's poles			1
data from @entity197 s @entity99 spacecraft suggests that @entity93 are seeded by space dust @entity199 from @entity200 , told @entity201 : ‘ we expected the comet to survive and hoped to gather some large particulates in december			2
‘ now if we get something , it would be particulates from the coma [ the major part of the head of a comet ] and tail left when it was approaching the sun , ’ he said			0
dust gathering can take place the @entity55 because the air over the polar continent is cleaner compared to more inhabited locations			1
the scientists plan to use five 150 - square metre polyethylene canvases as traps			0
each trap will be unrolled and left in the hope that some comet particulates would fall on it			0
then they will be preserved in chemically inert argon gas and shipped to @entity74 for microscopic study , which is expected to start in may			0
@entity51 said sky watchers should also be on alert			0
the odds of seeing anything are low , but comet @entity0 could be full of surprises			0
last year the ' comet of the century ' was spotted on a trajectory towards the sun before appearing to disappear , yet shortly afterwards bright lights ( pictured top left ) were spotted that some scientists have claimed could be the comet 's nucleus			2

debris could be hitting @entity14 tonight at a speed of 125,000 mph ( 56 km / s )
it could take months for the fine dust to settle out of the high atmosphere
while the dust is in the atmosphere it could produce noctilucent clouds
these are icy clouds that glow blue as they float above @entity14 's poles
scientists at the @entity55 station are in place to gather dust from comet which could help them find the ' basic building blocks ' of life
