@entity0 will make a final bid for @entity2 before giving up on signing the wantaway @entity4 midfielder			1
new @entity0 boss @entity5 is determined to take his former player with him from the south coast but after a summer of big name departures @entity4 are reluctant to let another of their major assets go			0
@entity2 has claimed that he has a gentleman 's agreement with the club to let him go but until now @entity4 have held firm - although their resolve could be tested by @entity0 ' final bid			0
@entity17 for @entity5 refuses to discuss reported target @entity2 mover and shaker : @entity2 will be the subject of one last bid from @entity0 this summer back in action : @entity2 gets challenged by @entity24 as he prepares for the new season @entity27 - @entity26 - £ 23m @entity28 - @entity26 - £ 4m @entity29 - @entity26 - £ 20m @entity31 - @entity30 - £ 31.5m @entity32 - @entity34 - loan the @entity36 international informed his new boss @entity35 that he was ' not mentally or physically able ' to play for @entity4 due to the speculation surrounding his future			2
however he has trained all this week and starts for @entity4 for the trip to face @entity26 - and two former team - mates in the form of @entity29 and @entity28 - at @entity42			1
the £ 27million - rated central midfielder will hope he can seal a move to @entity45 before the close of the summer transfer window but that will depend on @entity4 's response to what will be @entity0 ' final attempt to secure his signature			2
get me that man : @entity5 still wants to add his former midfielder to his @entity0 squad big departures : @entity28 , @entity31 , @entity29 and @entity27 have all left @entity26 this summer			0

@entity0 will only make one more offer for the @entity4 midfield man
@entity62 wants his former player to join him in @entity45
@entity2 wants to move after playing in the @entity65 with @entity66
he has trained this week and starts against @entity26 at @entity42
