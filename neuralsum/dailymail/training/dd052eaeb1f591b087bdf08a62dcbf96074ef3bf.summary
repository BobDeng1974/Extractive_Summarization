by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 11:49 est , 16 april 2013 these incredible images of old baseballs come in a remarkable range of shapes and appearances as years of decay have taken their toll			2
for years keen photographer @entity8 walked his dog near an old baseball diamond where he would pick up discarded old balls			1
he bought them back to his studio in @entity14 , @entity15 , where they sat for years until he decided to start photographing them			1
out of this world : the patterns of decay on this old baseball look remarkably similar to the continents @entity23 as seen in satellite photographs collection : for years keen photographer @entity8 walked his dog near an old baseball diamond where he would pick up discarded old balls			1
then he finally decided to immortalise them in this unique set beaten : in this photo the baseball 's wool windings are bursting out , perhaps after some mammoth strike curious : mr @entity8 , who ironically has n't been to a game for about ten years , admits he cares more about aesthetics than history			1
these two remarkable examples show the different kinds of balls in use home run ! an official @entity43 basebal consists of a round cork centre , wrapped tightly in windings of wool and polyester or cotton yarn , covered by stitched leather innards : wool is the most - used material for the windings because its natural resilience and ' memory ' means it compresses when pressure is applied before rapidly returning to its original shape mr @entity8 , who ironically has n't been to a game for about ten years , admits he cares more about aesthetics than history			1
' i collected them more for the way they look than the sport itself - there is something quite fascinating about them , ' he said			2
' some people have said it reminds them of connecting to their childhood			0
i just think what appeals to me is what appeals to other people too			0

coming to pieces : to be accepted for use in competition each must weigh between five and five - and - a - quarter ounces and have a circumference of between nine and nine - and - a - quarter inches range of shapes : the battered baseball on the left looks like it could almost be a face			0
the one on the right looks like it might explode if you put a match to the stitching poking out from its top grotesque : this beaten baseball bears a remarkable resemblance to a @entity114 monster , with it 's mouth half stitched together and two unevenly placed , malevolent eyes peering back decaying : mr @entity8 insists he does n't manipulate anything about his found baseballs , although he does try to preserve some live moss when it appears running out : mr @entity8 says he 's exhausted the supply of baseballs from the old diamond near his home in @entity14 , @entity15 , and now has to collect baseballs when he 's travelling elsewhere just rubber composite : this cheaper model baseball would be unlikely to pass the @entity43 's criteria the patterns of decay sprawl across mr @entity8 's battered baseballs - with one bearing an uncanny resemblance to a map of @entity23			1
but mr @entity8 insists he does n't manipulate anything about them , although he does try to preserve some live moss when it appears			1
' i have exhausted the field near my house so now i have to collect balls when i travel , ' he added			2
' although there is one half - buried and growing moss in a local park			0
i know right where to find it if i ever need to			0
