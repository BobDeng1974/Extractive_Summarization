by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity3 's future with @entity4 remains unresolved but it appears increasingly likely that he will have to accept a markedly reduced role at @entity6 next season			1
@entity8 understands that @entity3 will hold high level talks with executive vice-chairman @entity10 within the next week as the two parties attempt to find a compromise solution following the appointment of @entity14			0
@entity3 , a graduate of the class of ' 92 , was brought to @entity6 by the recently - deposed @entity16 last summer in the role of first - team coach and was then retained when @entity19 assumed managerial responsibilities for the final four games of the season			2
@entity36 was appointed as an assistant coach at the beginning of the summer and further doubt was cast over @entity3 's role after fellow @entity42 @entity41 was appointed on sunday afternoon to work under @entity43 with the first team			0
the @entity4 players who did not feature at the @entity30 - including cast - offs such as @entity47 and @entity48 - returned for medical tests late last week before beginning ball - playing sessions under @entity19 on monday			0
own team : @entity14 has brought in a lot of his own men for the job at @entity6 the new man : @entity19 will be the new no 2 at @entity4 experience : but the @entity4 board want to keep as many of the class of ' 92 as possible at @entity6 certainly , one would expect that a senior coach to be present on the first day back for pre-season but a senior @entity4 source was unable to confirm on monday evening whether @entity3 had been present at the club 's @entity64 training ground as the players regrouped following their summer break			1
@entity4 are understood to be keen to retain @entity3 's services in some capacity , maintaining that ' the class of ' 92 are very important to the club ' but with @entity43 's backroom staff becoming increasingly bloated , the former @entity4 player is going to have to settle for a role carrying considerably less responsibility than last season .			2

@entity3 's future at the club remains unresolved with pre-season underway
will have a markedly reduced role should he remain at @entity6
new boss @entity14 will bring many of his own *people* in with fellow class of ' 92 *member* @entity19 appointed as his no 2
