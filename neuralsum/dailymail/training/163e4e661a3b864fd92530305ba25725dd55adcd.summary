by @entity0 published : 18:29 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 18:35 est , 3 january 2013 @entity1 says three angels came to his bedside and asked him if he wanted to go to heaven , after he suffered a massive stroke that left him unable to walk			1
speaking for the first time nearly a year after the debilitating ischemic stroke , the @entity7 junior senator for @entity8 described how the angels stood over him and asked : ' you want to come with us ? ' to which he responded : ' no. i 'll hold off			1
' @entity1 , 53 , recounted his harrowing journey in an in - depth interview with the @entity18 , just days before he returned to the @entity19 as @entity20 convened today			1
he 's back : @entity7 senator from @entity8 @entity1 , second from left pictured with vice president @entity22 and @entity24 senator from @entity26 @entity25 , walks up the east steps of the @entity19 after returning to @entity28 after suffering the serious brain trauma on january 21 , 2012 , doctors put the senator in a coma and performed several surgeries , temporarily removing a 4 - by - 8 inch portion of skull to allow his brain to swell and heal			1
@entity1 did n't know any of this at the time , but what he did know was how close he came to death			2
' a thing goes off in your head that this is the end , ' he told @entity43 , adding that the life - changing event has deepened his faith and dramatically changed his outlook			2
' i would say that i definitely became much more religious , ' @entity1 said			2
' they say there are no atheists in foxholes , and this stroke put me into a very deep foxhole			2
yet , that feeling of faith sustained me , so i have no feelings of anger or regret			2
' serious : after suffering the serious brain trauma on january 21 , 2012 , doctors put the senator , right , in a coma and performed several surgeries , temporarily removing a 4 - by - 8 inch portion of skull to allow his brain to swell and heal a little help : vice president @entity22 watches at left as senator @entity1 walks the steps of @entity28 with a little help from his cane all smiles : sen. @entity1 , @entity74 , third from right , said he visualized returning to work while he recovered from his debilitating stroke his left arm is slack , but @entity1 gestures emphatically with his right hand as he describes how the experience made him resolve ' to never , ever give up			1
' and he did n't			2
today , with the help of some friends , @entity1 climbed the 45 steps of the @entity82 for the first time since his stroke			1
walking those stairs was something the senator visualized during the seemingly endless physical therapy sessions at the @entity89 that left him exhausted , sore and , sometimes , nauseated			1
' i kept imagining going back to work , ' @entity1 told @entity43 , ' and the irreducible physical amount of effort i had to put in			0
' @entity1 's stroke — caused by a blocked artery — occurred on the right side of his brain , which affects movement on his left side			1
but his doctor , @entity100 , said the senator was lucky it did n't strike on the left side as his ability to speak , understand and think would have been damaged			1
embrace : @entity106 vice president @entity22 , left , welcomes back @entity8 senator @entity1 upon his return to the @entity19 today journey : @entity1 , 53 , recounted his harrowing journey in an in - depth interview with the @entity18 , just days before he returned to the @entity19 as @entity20 convened today			1
thumbs up : @entity112 sen. @entity112 of @entity113			0
gives a thumbs - up at left , as sen. @entity1 , @entity74 , second from right , accompanied by vice president @entity22 , right , and sen. @entity25 , @entity116 , walks up the steps to the @entity19 door @entity1 also had to relearn to walk , a process he describes as frustrating and exhausting			1
but it came with a breakthrough moment , he said			0
' i figured a way to think about it			0
my left leg was like a dead tuna that was stapled to my hip			0
i had to use my hip to swing forward			0
the day that i figured it out , i could n't stop walking			0
' today , @entity1 told the @entity18 , all of the blood clots in his body are gone , including one in his left leg that could have triggered another stroke			1
much of the remarkable recovery he attributes to his medical team			0
' the only reason i 'm doing so well ( is ) this was n't the first rodeo for my doctors and nurses , ' @entity1 told the @entity18			0
' the story of my recovery was the story of medical professionals who did n't complicate problems			0
' there are , however , some signs of the stroke that linger , leading @entity1 to refer to himself as a ' disabled @entity106			1
' trial : @entity1 is taking part in an intensive walking study for stroke patients which will help him quicken his walking pace and , he hopes , enable him to climb the 45 steps to the @entity82 praise : in the video the senator thanked the staff at the @entity89 , as well as the people of @entity8 for granting him the ' honour ' of representing them he now speaks clearly , but more softly , slowly and deliberately than before			1
his left side has suffered partial paralysis , requiring him to use a four - pronged cane , and he has limited use of his left arm			2
he is also blind in one quadrant of his left eye , he told the @entity18			0
@entity1 will rely on the help of staffers as he resumes his duties in the senate , and will live in a new , wheelchair accessible apartment on @entity28			0
while in @entity173 , he will attend therapy three days a week			2
but he says his renewed faith , and lease on life , will make him even more determined to succeed in his role			0
' ( i am determined ) to just keep going , even when things feel like we 're at the end here			0
which is what the @entity184 was like for me			0
