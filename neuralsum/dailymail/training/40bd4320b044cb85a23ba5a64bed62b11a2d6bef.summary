@entity0 has played down his role in the development of @entity3 , insisting the @entity5 manager became the special one all by himself			1
@entity7 faces the toughest test of his reign as @entity11 manager on sunday when unbeaten league leaders @entity5 come to @entity13			1
in the away dugout will be a man @entity7 first crossed paths with 17 years ago when the @entity17 offered the then 34 - year - old coach a position on his coaching staff at @entity21			1
@entity3 has since forged a hugely successful career of his own which has yielded an astounding 20 trophies to date			2
the @entity36 often credits a lot of his success to @entity7 and his other mentor sir @entity39 , but the @entity11 manager thinks the main reason behind @entity3 's success is the man himself			1
' he talks about @entity0 and also @entity39 , and i appreciate that , but you always do it by yourself , ' @entity7 said			2
' i was also an apprentice when i was the assistant coach of @entity47 ( at @entity48 ) and it 's good that my eyes were also open at that time			0
' and it 's good that @entity3 's eyes were very open when he was my assistant , but you do it by yourself			1
' @entity3 has riled many leading figures in football , whether it be in @entity36 , @entity59 , @entity60 or @entity61			0
just three weeks ago he was tussling with @entity62 , the man he called a ' specialist in failure ' in february			0
@entity3 , then @entity66 manager , greets @entity7 , who was boss of @entity67 at the time the 51 - year - old has been viewed as a somewhat arrogant figure ever since he proclaimed himself the ' @entity26 ' when he arrived at @entity5 10 years ago , so it was with some surprise that @entity7 chose to describe @entity3 as ' modest ' at his pre-match press conference on friday			1
and , anyone who turned up to the media briefing hoping to hear about a breakdown in relationship between the two men due to the fact that they are now domestic rivals , was disappointed			0
indeed , @entity7 had nothing but kind words to say about his former assistant			0
' he 's such a wonderful coach , ' @entity7 added			1
' and to see that he 's been a champion in different countries is fantastic			2
' he is a very modest and emotional human being , and i like that			0
' he 's very special but he is very special for me because i 've worked with him and we 've continued our relationship , which in the football world is not always normal			0
' @entity7 had nothing but kind words to say about @entity3 ahead of their clash at @entity13 on sunday @entity7 says @entity3 is ' a wonderful coach ' and that seeing him become a champion has been ' fantastic ' one of the hallmarks of @entity3 's management career has been his propensity to engage in mind - games with his rivals			1
the @entity36 has kept the public guessing with his updates on the fitness of star striker @entity103 in recent weeks			0
@entity3 said he did not expect @entity103 to start against @entity11 when he spoke following @entity5 's win over @entity105 on wednesday , but at his pre-match press conference two days later , he said the striker had a ' little chance ' of recovering from his illness to play			1
@entity7 appears to believe the @entity60 striker , who moved to @entity111 in a £ 32million move from @entity113 this summer , will start			0
' i think that he [ @entity3 ] shall play with him when he can because he wants to win , ' the @entity17 added			2
@entity3 's @entity5 sit top of the @entity117 table after an unbeaten start to the new season @entity3 has kept the public guessing with updates on the fitness of star striker @entity103 in recent weeks @entity3 may have trouble selecting a striker for the clash with main man @entity103 ( pictured ) unlikely to make it ' of course he can play maybe because he has trained individually , i have heard and read ( that ) on the websites			1
i also have my eyes always open ! ' he 's scored nine out of seven - that is remarkable			0
so he 's in good shape , i think , but he was ill yesterday , so you never know			0
' @entity132 is fit for @entity11 's crunch match against @entity5			1
click here for the full story ! @entity7 confirmed @entity11 's own star @entity132 , has been passed fit after he overcame the thigh injury he suffered in the 2 - 2 draw against @entity138 on monday			1
the draw at the @entity140 underlined the difference between @entity11 and @entity5 so far this term			2
thanks to the addition of @entity103 and @entity145 , the @entity146 have brutally swept almost everyone before them so far this term and rightly sit atop the @entity117			0
@entity11 , on the other hand , have performed inconsistently , leaving them some 10 points behind the league leaders , much to @entity7 's disappointment			2
' @entity5 are one of the top teams , ' he said			0
' they are playing like a team and i want my team to do that as well , for a full 90 minutes			0
' @entity132 is fit for @entity11 's crunch match against @entity5 on sunday at @entity13 the £ 60million signing was struggling with a thigh injury picked up in their 2 - 2 draw at @entity138			1
