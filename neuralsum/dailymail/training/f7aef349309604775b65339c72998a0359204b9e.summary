by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 06:54 est , 25 march 2013 arriving home to find a stranger 's car parked outside is a persistent problem which has driven @entity5 up the wall			1
so , to prove his point , the angry homeowner has painted yellow lines all over the one at the front of his cottage			1
while it is yet to be seen whether the extraordinary tactic will help to deter other drivers from leaving their cars outside , the new paintwork has certainly raised eyebrows in his neighbourhood			0
not on my doorstep : so fed up with cars parked outside his front door , @entity5 painted double yellow lines on his £ 165,000 cottage last week mr @entity5 , 48 , an engineer from @entity25 , @entity26 , now says he will not paint over the lines until the council agrees to put a resident 's permit bay outside for him to use			1
' i 'm at work all day and then turn up at midnight and i 'm having to drive half way round the village to find somewhere to park , ' he added			1
' i had to park a quarter of a mile away from my house the other day			2
' the lines will stay put until we can get it resolved			2
then i can have my nice white cottage back again			0
' mr @entity5 , who has lived in the £ 160,000 two - bedroom home for 25 years , claims the problem started in 2011 when the council narrowed one end of the street , making it impossible to park on both sides			1
disagrees with paint job : mr @entity5 decided to take matters into his own hands after the council repainted the parking double yellow lines but stopped short of his front door yellow lines were then painted on the road but the section in front of his home was left out - meaning it is now one of the few spots in the immediate area on which motorists can legally park			1
three weeks ago the lines were repainted , making the problem worse , he says			1
as well as complaining to the council , mr @entity5 last week decided to take more drastic action - painting an arc of yellow lines across the front of his cottage , as well as a bright yellow exclamation mark by the front door			1
he said : ' parking has n't been a problem until a few years ago and it 's got worse			0
it 's a hassle and time consuming and not ideal when it 's dark			0
we deserve our own place to park			2
' we 've been to ward meetings and it 's been suggested we park on the other side of the village			2
we do n't just need parking restrictions , we need residents ' parking permits			2
parking permit : mr @entity5 says he will get rid of the yellow lines when the council gives residents parking permits now that it is so difficult to find a park ' the lines will stay put until we can hold talks with the council about having these permits and maybe we can get it resolved			1
' @entity98 , 66 , has also complained of strangers parking outside her home on @entity101			0
she added : ' there are times i 'm coming home and i 'm worried about whether i can get a space on my street			0
' i 've been able to park outside my home or further up the street before and it 's been fine but now i have to try and find somewhere else			2
it 's quite frightening at night			0
' not everyone can have parking outside their home but the reason we moved here is because we knew we could park on this street			0
it 's not always the case anymore			0
' @entity26 said yellow lines were needed because when they were not there in the past emergency services were restricted by congestion on the road			0
a spokeswoman added : ' we are well aware of the difficulties parking in @entity101 , which is a narrow road			0
' if residents want to apply for a permit scheme for the road it would be considered			1

@entity5 took the drastic action because the council had repainted lines but stopped short of his front door
this meant it is now legal to park outside his property
he is demanding a residents ' permit scheme and is in talks with the council
