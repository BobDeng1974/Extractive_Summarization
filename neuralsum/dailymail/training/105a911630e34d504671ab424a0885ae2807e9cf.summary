4 : @entity0 the 2014 version of the @entity1 national football team is so full of holes it remains distinctly possible that somebody could yet give them a rather embarrassing hiding over the next fortnight			1
nevertheless , in the shape of their remarkable forward @entity0 they boast a young footballer who seems determined to make this @entity41 his own			1
can one player drive a nation to the ultimate glory all by himself ? maybe not but he can make a heck of a difference and in the capital of his country last night , @entity0 ensured his team ended the group stages on a rapturous high			2
certainly the @entity52 forward has tapped in to the emotion and warmth of this tournament			0
on monday night he got pushed in to the photographers by one @entity58 player and slapped in the face by another			2
he responded with goals , though , beautiful goals , and after each he was waving his arms at the crowd , imploring them to offer more from the towering stands of the magnificent @entity66			0

goals : @entity0 17 , 34 ' , @entity132 ' , @entity115 ' att : 69,112 @entity133 : @entity0 referee : @entity135 ( @entity136 ) 6.5 it was a terrific sight , even if it did n’t completely mask @entity1 ’s frailties			1
there are simply too many of those to ignore but – after the lumbering @entity120 added a third goal in the second half and @entity144 ’s @entity115 came on to score a fantastic fourth - it ensured that 70,000 people went home optimistic rather than concerned for the durability of @entity150 ’s side			1
as the dust settled , it was hard to ignore @entity115 ’s impact			0
it is rather mysterious why @entity150 does n’t start with him			0
he is exactly the kind of pragmatic , intuitive holding player that this team needs			0
the goal he scored was lovely , too			0
by the end , as @entity58 tired and ragged , @entity1 had begun to knock the ball around with confidence and played their best football of the night and perhaps even the tournament so far			1
@entity115 ’s goal came on the back of that football as four passes were exchanged to allow him to advance and poke a perfect shot across goalkeeper @entity86 and in to the far corner			0
as auditions for a place in the last sixteen tie against @entity177 go , it was pretty convincing stuff from a player who did so much to assist @entity144 ’s reclaiming of the @entity182 trophy			0
it is hard , though , to watch this @entity1 team without being drawn to the sight of @entity0 ’s imperious play			1
a footballer with perfect balance , dextrous feet and a scrapper ’s heart , he is a middleweight who punching ferociously at the highest level			0
on monday night @entity1 did what @entity1 do , which is to look capable and completely incapable at the same time , depending on which half of the field you were looking at			1
this is a team that often looks lost when it does n’t have the ball , a team through which panic spreads when even the most basic set - piece is delivered in to their penalty area			0
follow my lead : @entity0 scored again in the 34th minute as he strike got the better of @entity86 @entity206 : @entity1 are through to the last 16 of the @entity207 after the win against @entity58 jubilant : @entity89 ( centre ) celebrates scoring @entity58 's first goal of the game against @entity1 back in it : @entity58 got themselves back into the game but their joy was to be short - lived @entity120 scored his first @entity41 goal in eight years as he headed home against @entity218 here to find out more from our brilliant @entity221 service safe : @entity120 nodded home a @entity80 cross to put his side into the driver 's seat against the @entity58 setback : the @entity231 's react as a @entity89 strike bring @entity58 back into the game game over : @entity1 's @entity120 ( 9 ) heads the ball home to give @entity1 a 3 - 1 lead in the second half click here to see more from our brilliant @entity221 - including this touch map of @entity0 's second goal of the game but when he needed them to calm their nerves , @entity0 did not fail them			1
that is why he is the talisman of @entity150 ’s team			0
shoved in to the hoardings by @entity87 early on here , @entity1 ’s golden child ignored the offer of a handshake and exacted perfect retribution by scoring the opening goal			1
@entity116 hussled for – and won – the ball down the left and advanced to cross low towards @entity0 who opened his body and side - footed the ball left to right across @entity86 and in to the corner			2
it was a super goal			0
moments later @entity0 crashed a volley goalwards from 18 yards and though @entity86 saved it looked as though @entity1 would run riot			1
instead their own defensive frailties allowed @entity58 back in to the contest and for 15 minutes we saw the very worst of the hosts			2
gap : the @entity231 forward wheels away to celebrate giving the @entity1 a 3 - 1 lead royalty : prince @entity274 ( centre ) applauds after @entity1 's second goal of the game @entity81 sliced one cross over his own bar in the 25th minute and then headed a corner against his own post and over			1
from the next set piece @entity58 scored			2
the ball was cleared to the left side and when @entity87 picked it up , beat the flat - footed @entity81 at the second attempt and crossed low to the far post , @entity80 was caught on his heels as @entity89 ambled in to score			2
it was an equaliser that @entity58 deserved			2
they had shown some spirit and some ambition			0
pain : @entity0 was substituted in the 71st minute after jarring his knee but it was though to be a precaution jubilant : @entity80 ( left ) roars with delight as his team all but secure a place in the last 16 complaining : @entity113 shouts after being fouled in the first half soon , though , @entity0 arrived to hurt them again , running on to a @entity113 header , cutting inside on to his right foot to shoot low to the goalkeeper ’s left from 18 yards			1
that rather discouraged @entity58 and thereafter there was just one winner			2
@entity120 looked offside when he headed in @entity80 ’s cross in the 50th minute but as @entity1 flourished late on there was no disputing the quality of @entity115 ’s goal			1
by then @entity0 had departed after one heavy tackle too many			0
a nation will pray for his recovery			0
in the air : the @entity52 star falls during the @entity74 @entity41 clash battle : @entity98 ( centre ) is harrassed by @entity0 and @entity321 ( right ) fall : @entity58 's midfielder @entity322 ( left ) fails to get the ball of @entity325 star @entity117			1

@entity0 scores twice to help @entity1 into the @entity41 last 16 with a win against @entity58
@entity120 *grabbed* his first @entity41 goal in eight years to put @entity1 into a 3 - 1 lead
@entity89 put @entity58 level in the first half
@entity58 crash out of the *summer* tournament
