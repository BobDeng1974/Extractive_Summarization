by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 16 january 2013 a choirmaster groomed a pupil at a leading private school and raped her while his wife watched , a court heard yesterday			2
the teenager was allegedly tied to a bed with a belt before @entity9 was told by his wife @entity10 to ‘ show her what he ’d done to her ’ during their two - year teacher - pupil affair			1
the pair , both 68 , are on trial over sex offences dating back more than 30 years			2
trial : today @entity9 appeared at @entity20 charged with rape and six counts of indecent assault following a police investigation along with his wife @entity25 @entity27 , prosecuting , told the court @entity9 was a brilliant and charismatic teacher whose only problem was he ‘ could not keep his hands off ’ the girls at @entity33 in @entity34			1
he allegedly used his office there to initiate sex acts with the pupil , beginning in 1978 when she was 14			1
he also indecently assaulted her in a camper van he kept parked at school and at his home when she helped babysit his daughters , @entity34 @entity20 was told			0
the alleged abuse culminated when she visited the couple at home aged 18 and was told mrs @entity25 knew of the affair			0
mrs @entity25 is said to have told the teenager ‘ she had always wanted a sexual relationship with a woman ’ and that the girl ‘ owed her ’ because of what had happened with her husband			2
the girl was taken upstairs and forced to take part in a sex act by @entity61 , who displayed a ‘ great thrill ’ , said mr @entity27			2
she was loosely tied to a bed using a belt , the jury was told , before mrs @entity25 told her husband to ‘ show her what he ’d done ’ to her , and the pair had sex			0
@entity9 went on to target at least two more girls , the court was told , one of which resulted in a sexual affair			1
prestigious : @entity9 was director of music at the renowned @entity33 in @entity34 until 1994 court hearing : the charges relate to the alleged abuse and rape of a teenage girl the first , a boarder at @entity82 ’s at the same time as the alleged victim , was said to have been propositioned during a school trip when she was 17			1
@entity9 pinned her up against the wall in a dark corridor and told her ‘ you want it really , do n’t you ? ’ , mr @entity27 said			1
but she told him to ‘ * * * * off ’ , ducked out of the way and ran back to her dormitory , he said			0
around 15 years later , in the mid- 1990s , @entity9 allegedly groomed a 16 - year - old , first giving her ‘ platonic ’ hugs in his office before moving on to kisses			1
eventually he began helping to take off her top and suggesting she perform a sex act on him , the court heard			2
but one evening principal @entity103 knocked on @entity9 ’s door and heard ‘ scuffling ’			1
@entity9 called out ‘ wait a minute ’ and , when mr @entity103 was allowed in , the girl could be seen exiting by a second door			1
following an inquiry that year , 1994 , @entity9 resigned			1
the trial was told the original alleged victim later told several people of her affair with @entity9 but never directly complained to police			1
however three decades on she told a doctor who did inform detectives , resulting in the now divorced couple ’s arrest			0
the court heard the former pupil – now 48 – had been a hugely gifted musician			0
but she was also a disruptive , badly - behaved teenager who used alcohol from a young age and had been sexually abused by a relative			0
court : the pair have both pleaded not guilty at their trial at @entity128 , pictured @entity9 groomed her and the later pupil through flattery , mr @entity27 said , ‘ commenting on their figure , their dress ’ and also ‘ their musical talent ’			1
he would encourage the first girl to take part in sex acts in his office , telling her to use a side door rather than the main entrance so his secretary did n’t become suspicious , the jury was told			1
her bad behaviour eventually led to her being suspended , and she was sent to live with the @entity146			0
by the time she was 15 he was treating her as his girlfriend , taking her to pubs and allegedly indecently assaulting her beside a canal			2
she went to study music abroad when she was 16 , but on her return to @entity153 went to visit the @entity146 where the alleged rape took place			0
at the time , she did n’t regard what happened as abuse and saw it as ‘ a small price to pay for the affection ’ he showed her			0
‘ the prosecution case is very much that he abused that position using his power , influence and personality to seduce her , ’ mr @entity27 added			0
the alleged victim began her evidence yesterday by describing how her home life was ‘ hell ’			0
she said she thought @entity9 was ‘ the bee ’s knees ’ , ‘ a special teacher ’ who needed to be ‘ worshipped ’ by his pupils			2
@entity9 , of @entity178 , @entity179 , denies one count of rape and 13 counts of indecent assault			1
his ex-wife , of @entity185 , @entity186 , denies one count of indecent assault and one of aiding and abetting rape			0
