by @entity0 for most of us , the thought of scaling the side of a building without any safety gear is enough to induce a nervous sweat			0
but for @entity7 and his friends from @entity9 , standing on top of giant structures without a harness is their idea of a fun day out			2
known as ' skywalkers ' , these brave and slightly fool - hardly adventurers practice a sport known as urban exploration , aiming to find and photograph lost , abandoned , or inaccessible places in cities			0
while there are many different types of urban explorer , skywalkers , as their name suggests , tend to prefer scaling rooftops , construction cranes and factory towers , as opposed to crawling through old drains or pipe networks			0
using their experience , a bit of know - how , and blueprints from library archives , @entity7 and his friends select some of the tallest buildings in @entity9 to scale , before stopping for an obligatory selfie at the top			1
as well as climbing these impressive structures in @entity42 , the group has also visited and climbed the international business park in @entity44 , and delved deep underground into a gypsum mine in eastern @entity9			2
at least one urban explorer is thought to have died in @entity9 while most urban explorers tend not to use and equipment , one thing that is required is plenty of upper body strength to perform death - defying stunts in this dizzying image , @entity7 leans backwards to take a picture of his friend as he climbs to the top of a tall building in @entity42 while @entity7 and his friends spend most of their time in @entity9 ( pictured ) , where they live , they have also scaled buildings in neighbouring @entity74 the only tools @entity7 and his friends use on their adventures are sturdy pairs of shoes , rucksacks , and of course cameras to capture the view from the tops of buildings @entity7 spends most of his time in cities , but has also ventured out to old industrial complexes ( pictured ) , and has crawled through tunnels into abandoned mine shafts in this image , one of @entity7 's friends shows no fear as he stands on top of a building high above the streets of @entity9 play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video			1

@entity7 , from @entity9 , is part of a group of ' skywalkers ' who aim to climb the country 's tallest buildings
with no ropes or safety harnesses , the team scale old industrial structures before taking pictures from the top
