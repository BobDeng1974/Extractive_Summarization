one day , he 'll be king			0
yesterday , however , prince @entity1 was just an avid racegoer so absorbed in the action that there was only one way to get his attention			2
though whether the chap attached to this tweed - clad arm would dare to tweak his ear quite so firmly then is another matter … it certainly tickled the @entity11 , who giggled as her husband eventually realised what was going on and turned to smile at his friend			1
they watched the races from a friend 's private box , where they were joined by wildlife presenter @entity41 and his wife @entity42			1
as he arrived , punters asked @entity1 who they should bet on and he replied chirpily , ' a horse '			2
but when he was asked whether he and @entity11 , who is five months pregnant , were having a boy or a girl , he simply smiled knowingly and tapped his finger on his nose			2
the ear - tweaking incident happened during the first race , which @entity1 watched intently			1
both he and @entity11 seemed delighted when @entity52 crossed the line as the runaway winner			2
the duchess , who appeared to clutch a betting slip in her left hand , cheered and clapped , while the duke shouted ' come on ' and beamed as our @entity59 came in first			0
picked a winner ? from @entity11 's expression it looks like today could have been her lucky day @entity11 , 31 , concealed her bump beneath a double - breasted @entity66 coat , in a blush colour which matched her radiant complexion			1
she teamed the coat with a brown hat and brown suede boots			2
she joined @entity1 on the balcony to watch the first two races , chatting excitedly with friends and placing her hand on the shoulder of a female companion			1
but by the third race , she had retreated into the warmth of the suite where she stayed for the rest of the afternoon			0

during the @entity95 , @entity1 found his loyalties divided as he cheered on both @entity97 's horse and @entity140 , which was ridden by his friend @entity141			1
but as 33 - 1 outsider @entity143 lagged hopelessly behind , the duke focused on @entity140 , shouting ' come on @entity141 ' at the top of his voice as it secured third place			0
