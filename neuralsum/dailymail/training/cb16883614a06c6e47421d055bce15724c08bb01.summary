@entity1 , said to have been suffering from a post-natal psychosis , told jurors she did not plan to cause any harm to the baby before the incident last september			1
@entity15 alleges the 25 - year - old @entity17 national deliberately placed her baby daughter into the chute with the intention of killing her			1
@entity21 , who denies attempted murder and inflicting grievous bodily harm , wept several times while giving evidence on the third day of her trial			1
speaking through a @entity30 interpreter , she told the court she was in tears while cleaning her bathroom shortly before placing the baby in the chute			1
' i was extremely sad , ' she told jurors			0
' i went to the living room , i put the baby in a rubbish bag and i threw her away			2
' after i had done so , i just could n’t believe what i had just done , and i could n’t understand why i did it			0
' i was in shock			0
' answering questions from defence barrister @entity45 , @entity21 added that she had not ' planned ' to do what she did and had not thought about what she was going to do			0
' even now as i am speaking to you , i am still in a state of disbelief of what i have done			0
@entity53 @entity52 heard that when the baby hit a metal plate at the bottom of the chute it was travelling at around 32mph			1
miraculously it survived but suffered severe brain injuries including several skull fractures ' i have lost control of my thoughts when i did so			1
' i ca n’t tell whether i was crying at the time or not , but i have done this			0

' asking @entity21 about her time in hospital after giving birth , @entity70 asked her client : ' did you have any thoughts at all of causing harm to her ? ' the defendant replied : ' no. that kind of thought never came to me			0
this is something i could never imagine			0
' i even despised people who were abusive to children			0
' prosecutors said they believe @entity21 knew what she was doing and intended to kill the baby @entity21 was ' tired , sad and exhausted ' in the week after her daughter ’s birth and unaware of why she was crying			2
at the start of the defence case , @entity70 claimed @entity21 ’s mental condition was so severe it prevented her from forming an intent to kill or cause serious injury to her daughter who fell more than 40ft into a bin store			1

ms @entity70 told the panel of seven men and five women : ' all i am asking you to do is to keep an open mind about the evidence you are going to hear in the next stage of this case			2
' you are going to hear evidence in the next few days that shows this defendant was suffering from post-natal depression			1
' the baby was found in a large bin wrapped in a piece of material after she was thrown down the rubbish chute submitting that @entity21 ’s depression was so severe it amounted to a condition called postpartum psychosis , miss @entity70 told jurors : ' what we are going to invite you to consider is that when this happened , @entity1 was not truly capable of making a rational , a considered judgment about things that she did			1
' describing @entity21 , who came to the @entity151 from @entity17 in 2011 , as a competent and loving mother , @entity70 also argued that her illness meant she was not capable of ' forming an intent to either kill or cause really serious injury to her baby '			2
