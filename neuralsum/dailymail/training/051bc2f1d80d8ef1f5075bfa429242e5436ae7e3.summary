@entity0 rejects the similarities instinctively , as though fearful of the debate becoming trite			1
both he and @entity3 were born in @entity4 , played as wingers for @entity6 and @entity7 and have borne the nation 's hopes for the team 's creativity and flair at the @entity14 finals			1
' we 're both from @entity4 and that 's about it , ' says @entity0 dismissively ' he 's right - footed and small			2
i 'm left - footed and average size			0
' however , having established the differences , he warms to his theme			0
@entity3 write caption here @entity3 heads off to @entity23 this week where @entity0 is the scorer of one of the greatest goals the @entity27 has ever seen - his 35 - yard dribble in 1984 in @entity6 's 2 - 0 win			1
and his 18 minutes in the @entity14 quarter - final defeat against @entity31 two years later was one the finest substitute appearances by an @entity6 player			1
almost saving the day for @entity6 , @entity0 crossed for @entity34 to score one goal and set him up for another chance which was agonisingly deflected wide			1
yet those were probably two of @entity0 's finest moments for @entity6 in a career spanning 12 years and which accumulated 79 caps			1
and they came when he was 22 and 23 years old			0
at @entity43 , he was injured by the time @entity6 produced their best performance abroad at a @entity14 , pushing @entity45 to penalties in the semi-final			2
so there is an element of almost paternal concern when @entity0 pleads for the wider public to be patient with @entity3 and to understand that what we see with @entity7 may not be replicated with @entity6 in @entity23 this summer			1
' i still do n't want to put so much pressure on him now that he has shown so much quality in the last few months of the season , ' said @entity0			2
dancing through the defence : @entity0 scored in the 44th minute in the @entity27			2
roughly 35 yards from goal on the left wing , he chested down a lofted pass from @entity64 before gliding past five defenders on an amazing run			0
he evaded a last - ditch tackle to guide his right - foot shot from the edge of the six - yard box past helpless keeper @entity71			0
' maybe he is going to be inconsistent because he is young			0
but in terms of what he did in the last few months of the season , he was probably the best player in @entity6			1
not the best @entity76 player ; the best player in @entity6 , the best attacking player in @entity6			1
' in terms of the way we play , we both like to dribble and @entity3 has improved a lot of his end product			2
now he does n't dribble all the time			0
he plays one - touch or two - touch football			0
he 's able to score , he 's able to create			0
at the start of the season , i thought his end product was n't what it should have been , but in the last three months of the season - not just in terms of his dribbling but in terms of his goalscoring , his ability to play one - touch , two - touch , his football awareness - it all improved in a small space of time			0
' @entity0 's view that @entity6 play the wrong way to get the best out of @entity3 seems to be supported by the stats			1
@entity3 is part of a @entity7 side that loves to keep the ball - they boasted a 56 per cent possession rate during last season 's @entity107			1
but @entity6 under @entity109 , as @entity0 points out , like to play their football in a very different way			1
against a poor @entity113 side on friday , @entity6 managed just 52 per cent possession , while at @entity115 they hardly saw the ball at all			2
during that tournament in @entity118 and @entity119 , @entity6 boasted a risible 39 per cent possession rate - only @entity121 and @entity122 kept the ball less , while eventual champions @entity124 enjoyed more than 65 per cent			2
however , @entity0 is hesitant to predict great things immediately			2
' people threw that at me all the time , ' said @entity0			2
' you do n't do for your country what you do for your club			0
it 's because your country plays completely differently to the way that your club does			0
' if you look at the way @entity3 plays and the way @entity7 play , @entity6 do n't play that way			1
the way @entity6 play - not dominating possession - is that going to suit @entity3 ? because if you look at @entity6 players in the past couple of @entity148 , the players who have made the most impact have been the defenders and hard - working midfield players			1
we play against teams who dominate possession			0
so it 's a war of attrition , backs to the walls , whereby @entity156 and @entity157 and the hard - working midfielders are the ones who are most important			0
' we 're talking about looking at all these flair players but are @entity6 going to play that way ? @entity6 do n't normally , as we saw against @entity45 and @entity163 in november			1
@entity6 lost those games , so i would not expect players to produce what they do for their clubs for their country			1
' all the most technically gifted englishmen of the last 30 years - @entity0 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 - have experienced these frustrations to varying degrees playing for @entity6			1
' all the flair players for @entity6 in the past , like @entity171 or @entity172 , were accused of not doing it for their country , because that is not what the @entity76 way is			1
now @entity6 is changing and is a much more technical team			2
nevertheless , they still do n't dominate possession against the @entity185 , the @entity186 , the @entity187 and other @entity188			0
so how can you get the best out of all these flair players , who need to have a lot of possession ? ' that 's why these players do well for @entity7 , because they need to have a lot of possession			1
to then say : " because you do that for @entity7 you 're then going to do that for @entity6 " is unfair			1
' it 's not just against teams such as @entity202 or @entity31 that we concede possession , we played against @entity204 ( in a @entity206 friendly in 1990 ) and they would have had as much possession , if not more than us , because that 's not how we play			0
@entity209 style : @entity6 winger @entity0 celebrates his stunning goal against @entity23 in 1984 ' we might beat them because we 're strong , we 're physical we 're good at set pieces and we 've got good goalscorers			1
for players who rely on having a lot of the ball , as @entity3 does and @entity216 does - all of these attacking players we have - if @entity6 are n't going to play that way to keep the ball more than the opposition , are we going to see the best of them ? ' that 's why @entity224 is going to be very important because , in defensive midfield , he will have a lot of work to do			1
hopefully @entity6 can get the balance right			2
' but the team reflects the manager			0
is @entity109 that type of manager , to say : " let 's keep the ball for 50 passes in the back four ? " i do n't think so			0
so regardless of what players you have , the team has to be reflective of the manager and the manager 's philosophy			0
' perhaps he 's going to play with @entity246 , @entity3 and @entity216 and all these attacking players and when we get the ball we 're just going to keep it for a long time			1
' @entity109 has n't shown us that ever in his career			0
even if he has got those players now with @entity6 , if that is not the type of manager he is @entity6 are n't going to benefit from doing it that way			1
' it would n't surprise me if @entity258 and people like that are very important because of the manager 's philosophy of having hard working players who do n't rely on possession to be effective			0
and @entity265 may not have done well for @entity266 , but he 's always done well for @entity6 in terms of alleviating pressure , working hard , tracking back			0
only @entity109 can tell us that			0
' @entity109 may be about to re-invent his persona in the minds of the public and unveil a free - flowing , attacking team			2
or the gap between excited @entity76 expectations and the reality on the pitch will yet again provide a chasm of despair .			0
