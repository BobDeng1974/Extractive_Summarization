the @entity1 was operating a covert mission in the @entity4 consulate in @entity5 when it came under attack by @entity8 - linked militants on september 11 , intelligent chiefs have admitted			1
four americans , including ambassador @entity9 , were killed in the six - hour , commando - style attack on the @entity12 in the @entity5 city , for which @entity8 and @entity15 militia @entity14 have been blamed			1
the @entity1 made the revelation as it laid bare the heroic rescue by a handful of its agents in which they fought off wave after wave of mortar and rocket attacks with just their handguns as they sought to infiltrate the compound and shepherd its @entity4 staff to safety			1
a timeline , released by the agency , has blown open the dramatic sequence of events , revealing for the first time that of the 30 @entity4 officials evacuated from the country following the deadly attack , just seven worked for the @entity36			1
burning issue : ambassador @entity9 and three other @entity4 were killed in a six - hour , commando - style attack on the consulate in @entity41 the rest were part of a crack team of intelligence and security experts on a secret mission aimed at counterterrorism and securing heavy weapons held by the embattled regime			1
they had been operating out of a building known as ' the annex ' , around a mile away from the consulate in central @entity41			1
intelligence officials told how when the annex received a call about the assault , about a half dozen members of a @entity1 security team tried to get heavy weapons and other assistance from the @entity5			1
but with time running out , the team went ahead with the rescue attempt armed only with their standard - issue small arms			0
killed : ambassador @entity9 ( left ) died of smoke inhalation , while agent @entity66 ( right ) died in a desperate battle with insurgents heroic : former @entity69 ( left ) and @entity70 ( right ) were killed in a mortar attack a fierce firefight ensued and the team managed to get into the consulate and shepherd its occupants back to the annex under constant attack from machine gun fire and rocket - propelled grenades			1
' the security officers in particular were genuine heroes , ' an official said			0
' they quickly tried to rally additional local support and heavier weapons , and when that could not be accomplished within minutes , they still moved in and put their own lives on the line to save their comrades			0
' at every level in the chain of command , from the senior officers in @entity5 to the most senior officials in @entity94 , everyone was fully engaged in trying to provide whatever help they could			0
' the @entity1 revelations come after @entity99 's administration came under sharp attack over its handling of the incident amid claims @entity94 told officers on the ground to ' stand down ' before the rescue took place			2
attack : a @entity4 ambassador and three other @entity4 were killed in the terror strike that occurred on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11 ' there was no second - guessing those decisions being made on the ground , by people at every @entity4 organization that could play a role in assisting those in danger , ' the official added			1
' there were no orders to anybody to stand down in providing support			0
' in the first days after the attack , various administration officials linked the @entity41 incident to the simultaneous protests around the @entity129 world over an @entity4 - made film that ridiculed @entity129 's @entity131			1
only later did they publicly attribute it to militants , possibly linked to @entity8 , and acknowledged it was distinct from the film protests			0
the changing explanations have led to suspicions that the administration did n't want to acknowledge a terror attack on @entity4 personnel so close to the nov. 6 election , a charge @entity99 has strongly denied			0
inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours according to the timeline , around 9:40 p.m. @entity41 time , officials at the @entity1 's relatively fortified and well - defended base in @entity41 got a call from @entity36 officials at the @entity4 diplomatic mission about a mile away that the less - fortified public mission complex had come under attack from a group of militants			1
other official sources said that the initial wave of attacks on the diplomatic mission involved setting fires using diesel fuel			0
9.40pm - @entity1 officials in ' @entity170 ' get a distress call from the consulate saying they are under attack			1
10.05pm - armed only with handguns , team of about six @entity1 security officers leave their base for the public diplomatic mission compound			2
10.30pm - with bullets whistling overhead , the @entity1 team move into the compound after unsuccessfully trying to get heavy weapons and help from local @entity5 allies			1
11.10pm - a @entity185 drone , which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away , arrived in @entity41 to help officials on the ground gather information			2
11.30pm - @entity4 personnel who had been working or staying at the mission all accounted for , except for @entity9			2
11.40pm - driving back to the secure base , the evacuees come under further fire			0
12am - the installation itself comes under fire from small arms and rocket - propelled grenades			0
12am - a @entity1 security team based in @entity200 , which included two @entity4 military officers , lands at @entity41 airport and begins plotting how to locate the missing ambassador			1
1am - the patchy attacks on the base begin to die down after 90 minutes of fierce fighting			0
4am - the reinforcements from @entity200 take a convoy of vehicles to the @entity1 base to prepare for evacuation			0
4.30am - a fresh round of mortar attacks is launched on the base , killing two @entity4 security officers			0
5.30 - a heavily armed @entity5 military unit arrive at the @entity1 base to help evacuate the compound of @entity4 personnel to the @entity41 airport			1
from 6am - roughly 30 @entity4 , as well as the bodies of @entity9 and the other three @entity4 killed during the attacks , were loaded on planes and flown out of the city , several @entity4 officials said			1
the dense smoke created by the fuel both made it hard for people at the compound to breathe and to organise a response to the attack			0
about 25 minutes after the initial report came into the @entity1 base , a team of about six agency security officers left their base for the public diplomatic mission compound			0
over the succeeding 25 minutes , the @entity1 team approached the compound , and tried , apparently unsuccessfully , to get local @entity5 allies to bring them a supply of heavier weapons , and eventually moved into the burning diplomatic compound , the intelligence official said			1
at around 11:10 p.m. , a @entity185 drone , which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away , arrived in @entity41 to help officials on the ground gather information			2
by 11:30 , @entity4 personnel who had been working or staying at the mission had been rounded up except for @entity9 , who was missing , the intelligence official said			2
when they tried to drive out of the diplomatic compound to return to the @entity1 base , however , the convoy carrying @entity4 evacuees came under fire			2
once they got back to the @entity1 base , that installation itself came under fire from what the intelligence official described as small arms and rocket - propelled grenades			2
these patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes , the intelligence official said			0
around the same time , a @entity1 security team based in @entity200 , which included two @entity4 military officers , landed at @entity264			2
upon its arrival , however , the team spent some time trying both to arrange local transport and to locate the missing ambassador @entity9			1
after some time trying to solve these problems , the security team that had flown in from @entity200 eventually arranged for an armed local escort and extra transportation , but decided not to go the hospital where they believed @entity9 had been taken			0
in part this was because they had reason to believe @entity9 was likely dead , and because security at the hospital was believed , at best , to be ' uncertain , ' the intelligence official said			0
not long before dawn , the reinforcements from @entity200 managed to take themselves and a convoy of vehicles to the @entity1 base to prepare for an anticipated evacuation			0
however , just after they arrived at the @entity1 base , the official said , a new round of attacks on that facility was launched , this time with mortars			0
although the mortar attacks lasted only 11 minutes , two @entity4 security officers were killed by a direct hit from one of the shells , the intelligence official said			2
finally , a bit less than an hour later , a heavily armed @entity5 military unit arrived at the @entity1 base to help evacuate the compound of @entity4 personnel to the @entity41 airport , the official added			1
over the next few hours , roughly 30 @entity4 , as well as the bodies of @entity9 and the other three @entity4 killed during the attacks , were loaded on planes and flown out of the city , several @entity4 officials said .			1
