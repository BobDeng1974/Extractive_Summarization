these are the videos that @entity2 president @entity1 does not want the world to see			1
the lifeless corpse of four - month - old @entity5 lies limp and motionless in a chair - tortured to death by government security officers after her parents were arrested			2
the disfigured body of a tortured taxi driver is seen dumped in the street , while a third video shows blood pouring from the arm of a woman gunned down by a sniper			0
hundreds more hours of the brutal scenes have been released in the last two months			1
they all show a country which has slowly descended into chaos - sparking fears there will be a civil war and floods of refugees fleeing across the border into @entity42			0
it is in stark contrast to the kind of society @entity1 's regime tries to portray - one where there are small pockets of unrest , but in the majority are happy with his rule			2
while none of the footage has been independently verified , the content is so compelling and realistic that there is little reason to doubt its veracity			0
the release of the videos mirrors those leaked during the @entity64 conflict , the most gruesome of which showed the capture of ousted leader colonel @entity67			2
they were ultimately proved to be real			0
battered : a video of this @entity2 showed how his back had been torn to shreds after a series of torture sessions by security forces wounded : one of the many videos being released each day showed a woman screaming in pain as blood drips from her arm after she was shot by a sniper but , while @entity64 rebels tentatively dipped their toes into the world of internet publishing , the @entity2 conflict is widely regarded as the first @entity28 war - where events are played out through its channels on an hourly , if not minute - by - minute , basis			1
much of the filming is being released on a daily basis via the @entity94 , a coalition movement covering most of the country which , according to its @entity97 page , is preparing for the overthrow of the regime			1
in its coverage of yesterday 's events the group , based out of the @entity102 capital of @entity103 , chronicled attacks , murders , fake rallies of support and crackdowns in the northeastern province of @entity112 , the northwestern city of @entity113 , the western city of @entity114 , and the central city of @entity116			0
the 40 - group strong coalition , which is playing an important role in highlighting the truth during the 10 - month - old uprising against @entity1 , also alleged how security forces covered - up ' abuses ' as the @entity125 monitors visited various areas of the country			0
to garner favour with observers , the @entity94 said ' fabricated marches ' in support of the regime took place in @entity112 as they arrived			1
protest : there is also several videos containing footage of rallies which , according to president @entity1 , do not occur very frequently dead : several of the videos show protesters who have allegedly been beaten to death by security forces security forces also ' curtained off ' various areas of a jail containing political prisoners so monitors did not ' really see ' what was going on			1
the @entity94 said it was all to shield observers , in @entity2 to see where @entity1 's troops are keeping their word on ending a violent and repressive crackdown , from what was happening			1
and , elsewhere in the area and in complete contravention of that deal , security forces were seen opening fire on protesters , leading to large numbers of arrests			2
in the @entity165 , where electricity is cut off for 15 hours each day , it said security buses and army vehicles routinely roamed the streets raising weapons at residents			2
in @entity176 the sound of the security forces ' heavy firing is constantly heard , @entity1 - sponsored gangs ran riot through @entity178 vandalising public property , and in @entity181 - year - old @entity180 was shot dead while out with friends			0
the increase in violence , and its release through the @entity94 , comes as many believe @entity1 is losing his grip on power			1
but despite foreign observers saying his rule could be coming to an end , he re-iterated today how he would not be stepping down			0
he insisted he still had his people 's support and repeated claims that a foreign conspiracy and terrorists were behind the 10 - month - old uprising against him - and not true reform - seekers .			0
