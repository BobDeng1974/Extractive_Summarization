by @entity1 reporter published : 17:57 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 01:56 est , 20 july 2012 the @entity2 has been accused of being ‘ testosterone - fuelled ’ after nine times as many male experts than women were shown on its flagship nightly news bulletin			1
nearly all the interviewees appearing on the @entity2 ’s @entity8 were male , according to researchers			1
the study , carried out over a week , found there was a night last month when only one woman featured on the programme ‘ in any capacity at all ’ – and she was on for only seconds			1
unbalanced : nearly all the interviewees appearing on the @entity2 ’s @entity8 were male , according to researchers last night , critics questioned whether the @entity2 was even making an effort to reflect @entity21 ’s gender balance , saying it was either ‘ lazy ’ or ‘ playing it safe ’			1
researchers from @entity24 carried out the study for industry magazine broadcast			1
anti-discrimination campaigner @entity27 said she was not surprised			2
she said : ‘ i saw the news on june 13			2
i was actually shouting at the screen “ where are the women ? ” ’ miss @entity27 , who won an ageism case against the @entity2 after she was removed from @entity32 , added : ‘ i do n’t know whether they are playing it safe or being lazy			1
’ not surprised : former @entity32 presenter @entity35 thought the @entity2 were being ' safe ' or ' lazy ' a @entity37 spokesman said : ‘ we do take the issue seriously and are working to improve the gender balance , although the @entity2 can not dictate who organisations put forward for interview			1
’ the ten o'clock news compared badly with rival shows			2
while it could only manage one in ten women as experts , for @entity44 it was three to one in favour of men and four to one on @entity51			0
the @entity54 show 's main rival , @entity55 's @entity52 , was shown to have a ratio of five men to every women when it came to expert guests			0
writing for @entity61 , @entity63 director of broadcasting at the university , said even for broader topics such as gay marriage , male interviewees were used ‘ for every aspect of the story '			1
the academic said : ‘ never mind women experts - there were n't any @entity21 women at all			0
' our monitor noted that within the 27 - minute programme , the only woman to feature appeared in an item about the @entity81 elections			1
how ironic is that ? ] ‘ on a @entity21 news programme , the only woman who made it on air was an @entity81 in a gym - a vox pop at that			1
‘ is it really likely that no women did anything of significance or had anything to say , in the whole @entity21 , on that day ? even the most intransigent male elitist would have to admit that it bizarre			2
' h. miss @entity63 said that because women journalists often appeared on the programme , such as @entity100 , as well as presenters @entity101 and @entity103 , there was an impression women were being fairly represented			2
in her article she said the ‘ extravagant ' amount of time given to sport was part of the problem			0
the research monitored the use of women on the ten o'clock news between tuesday june 12 and monday june 18			0
the other shows were measured between monday , june 11 to friday june 15			0
according to the research sport was responsible for between three and four minutes of most editions of the news programme in the week being measured			2
politics was found to have averaged about five minutes per night			2
the research also revealed that the only ten o'clock news ‘ package ' with more women than men in during the week was about poor families in @entity127			0
miss @entity63 said : ‘ stereotypes from the @entity2 ? perish the thought			1
' the monitoring found that @entity44 ‘ gets the prize ' for best use of female experts			0
as well as guests like @entity135 may it also used women to contribute to general stories			0
commended : as well as guests like @entity140 also used women to contribute to general stories the findings come after earlier this year director general @entity144 said there are not enough older women on television			0
he admitted the corporation had a ‘ case to answer ' over the lack of female presenters - especially in ‘ iconic roles ' and there were ‘ manifestly too few older women broadcasting on the @entity2 '			1
mr @entity144 added there were simply not enough women in ‘ key news and current affairs presenting roles ' , singling out the ‘ big political interviews '			0
he had said that while economics editor @entity100 is ‘ outstanding ' there are too few women among the most senior on - air specialist journalists			0
in recent years , respected figures such as @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , dame @entity168 and many others have spoken out about their concerns over the treatment of older women by all @entity173 recent months this has broadened out to include the shortage of women as experts and contributors on news programmes .			0

nearly all interviewees appearing on the @entity2 ’s @entity8 were male , according to researchers
on one night only one woman featured on the programme in any aspect
