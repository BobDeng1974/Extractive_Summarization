' this is the highest honor a detective can have , investigating the murder of a fellow police officer , ' the investigator reportedly said			1
surveillance footage uncovered by the @entity12 revealed @entity8 chatting on a cellphone while casually sauntering around carrying a white plastic bag which appears to be covering a container			1
he appeared to be attempting to hold the container upright and steady on the footage from the @entity52			0
at one point @entity8 used his back to open a glass door rather than upset the container			2
police now believe that @entity8 's semi-automatic handgun was inside the entire time as he made his two - mile journey through @entity1			1
@entity8 appeared to be attempting to hold the container upright and steady on the footage from the @entity52 the footage showed the killer backing through a glass door at the mall as if afraid to upset the container			2
investigators now believe that @entity8 was carrying a handgun in the box on the morning of december 20 , @entity8 shot his ex-girlfriend and posted an online death threat against police , according to investigators in @entity73			1
they used cellphone - tracking technology to follow his journey , via bus , to @entity31 in real time			0
he was tracked using the gps transmitter on a cellphone he had stolen from his ex-girlfriend			0
along the way , he posted threatening messages on social media including a vow to ' put wings on pigs '			0
the transmissions , or ' pings , ' showed he was traveling northbound on a bus on @entity89 that arrived in @entity90 at 10.49am			0

officers @entity13 , left , and @entity14 , right , were shot dead by @entity8 in their police car on december 20 @entity8 , pictured , killed @entity12 officers @entity13 and @entity14 , hours after posting threatens online against the police one showed his bloodied green shoe			1
the other showed his pistol			0

at 12:07pm , @entity8 ditched the phone near the @entity113 arena and disappeared			0
@entity115 police said they became aware of the @entity94 postings at about 1.30pm			0
they first tried calling a precinct in @entity119 but were told to call the precinct in the @entity122 neighborhood and had a conversation with police there around 2.10pm			0
police say the flier with @entity8 's photo was then faxed , at the @entity12 's request , to a @entity1 command at 2:46pm			1
it warned that he was in @entity1 , armed with a semi-automatic handgun and was saying online that ' he will shoot a police officer today			1
' two minutes later , @entity8 opened fire			0

police on both ends say they took immediate and proper measures to try to alert officers about an armed and dangerous fugitive bent on violence against law enforcement			0
but the seemingly antiquated way they did it has raised questions about the potential for communication lapses to hamper urgent manhunts			0
though refusing to fault how the warning was handled , commissioner @entity150 has called it ' an irony ' the ambush occurred a time when the @entity12 has launched a $ 160 million program to equip each member of the 35,000 - officer force with a department - issued computer tablet or smartphone to improve information - sharing			1
investigators were able to track @entity8 on surveillance footage because of his distinctive jacket ( pictured ) message : a wanted flier for @entity8 came too late , and was sent a mere two minutes before @entity8 walked up to a patrol car and shot the two @entity12 officers without warning currently , police departments in @entity31 , @entity172 , @entity173 and elsewhere mostly rely on dispatchers to make radio transmissions giving descriptions of suspects or fliers - copied and faxed - with mug shots passed out at roll calls			1
smaller forces have gone to blasting notifications to department - issued smartphones , but most larger ones say to do the same would be too expensive			0
in the case of @entity8 , it 's impossible to know whether an earlier warning would have made a difference			2
even if that information had been received earlier , all an officer sitting in a radio car would have received , @entity150 said , ' was an alert on the description of a black male , mid- 20s , that basically is making threats against police officers '			2
@entity12 officers stand for a moment of silence to mark the murders of two of their fellow officers			1
