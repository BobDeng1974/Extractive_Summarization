by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 17:21 est , 23 february 2013 @entity2 ’s nudes frolic on a primary colour beach , as bouncy as the beach balls they hold			1
the pop artist , the subject of a major retrospective at @entity10 ’s @entity9 , based these portraits from the early nineties on his then muse , @entity14			1
she was 22 – @entity2 was 70 – and admits the pictures remind her of how she once felt			1
‘ i was full of energy , emotions and drama			1
@entity2 loved dramatic women , ’ she says			1
‘ we had a lot of fun together , dancing in his studio			1
’ but for much of her life @entity28 , now 43 , has felt far from ebullient , having battled the debilitating neurological condition chronic fatigue syndrome ( @entity31 ) , once known as @entity32 ( myalgic encephalomyelitis )			1
new energy : although @entity14 thanks psychotherapy for her recovery , she say she could not have done it without husband @entity39 now living in @entity40 , she says the illness forced her to postpone a promising career as a singer and scuppered hopes of children			1
it started when she was 26			1
she had just signed a recording contract and was in a new relationship with @entity49 singer @entity39 who , at 59 , is still her partner			1
‘ during that year i became ever more fatigued			1
i tried to push on through it , but it got to a point where my legs would n’t support my body			1
i was clammy and flu - ey all the time			1
a doctor diagnosed me and i had to default on the contract			1
it felt as if my career had imploded and me along with it , ’ says @entity28			1
@entity31 / me first made the news in the mid-eighties , when doctors began to report on young patients who had inexplicable flu - like symptoms			1
@entity67 : how @entity2 saw @entity28 in his 1994 piece ' @entity69 ' when she was 22 medics were sceptical as to whether these young professionals were physically ill and it was quickly dubbed ‘ yuppie flu ’			1
‘ one common symptom is a feeling of debilitating tiredness , ’ says professor @entity74 , consultant neurologist at the @entity75 , @entity76 , who treats severe cases			1
‘ others experience painful muscles and joints , impaired mobility , headaches , disordered sleep , gastric disturbances , poor memory and concentration			1
’ ‘ outwardly you may look ok , but you ’re in a mental fog and your limbs are burning , ’ says @entity28			1
the current thinking is that @entity31 is a physical and mental illness			1
in ten per cent of cases , it ’s linked to viral infection , such as glandular fever , hepatitis or parvovirus			1
other triggers include surgery , an accident or physical and emotional trauma			2
@entity28 believes her tumultuous upbringing at the hands of her father @entity108 was to blame			2
the @entity110 - nominated screenwriter of hit movies @entity112 and @entity113 was a manic depressive whose psychotic episodes wreaked havoc on the household			2
his exploits are the stuff of movie industry legend			2
he ’d throw furniture from hotel room windows , terrorise those he was working with and was once arrested for threatening to assassinate the then - president @entity124			2
he repeatedly spent time in mental health institutions , often sent there by his daughters			2
‘ looking back , i see how my family was dysfunctional , ’ @entity28 says			2
‘ things were falling apart and i felt it was somehow my fault , ’ says @entity28			2
life did not improve when her parents divorced and her mother @entity133 remarried			2
‘ they were always fighting			2
@entity134 would subject me to these great onslaughts of rage			2
i was constantly fearful of what might happen next			2
over time , that can mess up your immune system , leaving you vulnerable to illness			2
’ perhaps unsurprisingly , @entity28 ’s first significant relationship was with the ‘ father figure ’ @entity2			0
‘ i ’d not had a proper father and you might say i found one for a while in him			0
’ lean on me : @entity28 found cognitive - behavioural therapy a great help and although she still has some episodes of fatigue she has finally been able to find her voice @entity28 believes her symptoms had been creeping up on her before she met @entity39 in 1996 , at a @entity157 party			1
it was love at first sight			0
‘ he said , “ why do n’t you come and stay with me in @entity163 ? ” so i did			0
i came , collapsed , and here i am still			0
‘ @entity39 was very patient with me			1
some weeks i would barely get out of bed			0
but he lives a quiet life , so we managed			0
’ after her diagnosis , @entity28 self - medicated with extra-strength painkillers			0
‘ i ’ve tried acupuncture , @entity171 herbal medicines , vitamin and anti-viral drips , allergy diets , oxygen tanks , ozone therapy , spiritual healing , massage therapy , yoga ... when you ’re desperate you ’ll try anything			0
’ the @entity182 recommends a combination of physiotherapy , cognitive - behavioural therapy ( @entity186 ) and a treatment known as ‘ pacing ’ , which involves teaching sufferers to know when to stop and rest			0
the @entity31 treatment centre at @entity10 ’s @entity192 is staffed by psychiatrists , immunological experts , physiotherapists and occupational therapists			0
there are around 250,000 @entity199 sufferers , and @entity192 receives 300 new referrals each year			0
‘ every case is treated according to their symptoms , ’ says professor @entity201 , consultant psychiatrist at @entity31 treatment centre			0
‘ if the patient is in pain , we prescribe painkillers			0
if they have problems sleeping , we look at why			0
some might simply need physiotherapy , others a combination of treatments			0
’ however , specialist services are still patchy			0
a survey of 2,000 patients found that 74 per cent had suffered from @entity31 for five years or more , with 49 per cent having been ill for more than ten years			0
@entity28 says : ‘ cognitive behavioural therapy helped , because it offers a structure with which to manage your energy			0
meditation ’s great , too			0
’ by 2006 , her fog had started to lift and she began to record the longed - for album , which will finally be released next month			0
‘ i still have episodes of fatigue , ’ she says			0
‘ but you ca n’t get stuck at a point of bitterness and resentment or the rest of your life will be ruined			0
i try to look on the bright side of the dark side			0
’ @entity239 ’s debut album ‘ @entity240 ’ - is released march 18th on @entity241 ericawexler.com			0

@entity14 , 43 , suffers from @entity32 or @entity32
she *overcame* her condition with through psychotherapy and with the support of her husband , rock star @entity39
