proposed changes to the official @entity1 mean tall people may not be as overweight as they thought , while those under 5ft 7ins could find themselves with a few extra pounds to shift			1
researchers at @entity4 say the formula currently used to calculate the @entity1 is flawed and renders tall people too fat and short people too thin			1
up until now @entity1 has been calculated simply by dividing a person 's weight by their height to give a rough estimate of amount of fat they are carrying as a percentage			1
fatter : actor @entity15 thinner : cyclist @entity16 @entity17 2ins old : overweight : 13st 13lb : obese 16st 10lb new : overweight 16st 10lb : obese 17st 9lb 6ft old : overweight : 13st 3lb : obese 15st 12lb new : overweight 13st 10lb : obese 16st 7lb @entity21 10ins old : overweight : 12st 5lb : obese 15st new : overweight 12st 11lb : obese 15st 5lb @entity21 8ins old : overweight : 11st 11lb : obese 14st 2lb new : overweight 11st 13lb : obese 14st 4lb @entity21 7ins no change : overweight : 11st 6lb : obese 13st 10lb @entity21 4ins old : overweight : 10st 6lb : obese 12st 7lb new : overweight 10st 3lb : obese 12st 4lb @entity21 2ins old : overweight : 9st 11lb : obese 11st 11lb new : overweight 9st 6lb : obese 11st 5lb 5ft old : overweight : 9st 3lb : obese 11st new : overweight 8st 10lb : obese 10st 6lb it means superfit but stocky athletes such as @entity34 's @entity33 hero sir @entity16 would no longer be classified as overweight while the little but large like actor @entity15 would have to lose more to reach their ideal weight			2
but the research team points out that it does not take into account the fact that people 's weight tends to grow with their height to the power of 2.5 giving taller people more room to expand			2
it means a strapping person of 6ft 2ins tall would now need to hit 14st 10lb as opposed to just 13st 13lb to be classified as overweight and a hefty 17st 9lb as opposed to 16st 10lb to be obese			0
at the other end of the scale , someone standing 5ft tall would now be classified as overweight at just 8st 10lb compared to the old limit of 9st 3lb and would be obese at 10st 6lb compared to 11st			0
study : researchers at @entity4 say the formula currently used to calculate the @entity1 is flawed and renders tall people too fat and short people too thin lead researcher professor @entity56 told the @entity57 : ' @entity1 divides the weight by too large a number for short people and by too small a number for tall people			1
' so short people are misled into thinking that they are thinner than they are and tall people people are misled into thinking they are fatter			0
' according to the @entity65 charity people should measure their body mass index ( @entity1 ) every three months and should know their own @entity1 and that of their family members			1
the charity said the @entity70 is struggling to cope with the rising tide of obese patients			0
' we can not go on letting our @entity70 pick up the pieces as weight balloons in both children and adults , ' said @entity79 trustee @entity78 as he launched the charity 's @entity80 , my future campaign			0
@entity83 , spokesman for the @entity84 , added : ' everyone should make a point of checking their @entity1 to see if they are keeping within a healthy weight range			1
if they are not , that should be the time to do something about it			0
it is quite easy unconsciously to put on extra pounds and , once you have , put yourself at risk of acquiring the nasty diseases associated with obesity			0
' if you have children , ensuring that their @entity1 stays safely within a healthy range is arguably even more important			2
