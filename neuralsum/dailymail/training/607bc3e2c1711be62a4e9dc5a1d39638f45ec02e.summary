former secretary of state @entity1 's speech at @entity3 today was met with tepid enthusiasm from students , with just half of seats in the reception hall appearing to be filled			0
pictures and video discovered by the @entity11 show empty clusters throughout the 750 - seat auditorium in which she spoke as part of a security conference being held at the @entity18 university			0
this is at least the second time in recent weeks that @entity20 has been unable to pack a room during an appearance just as the clock winds down for her to make a decision about whether she wants to carry her political party 's torch in 2016			1
@entity20 is back on the speaking circuit now that the midterm elections have concluded this photo , shared on @entity36 by a @entity38 photographer depicts a mostly empty balcony area during @entity1 's speech in @entity3 's @entity41 today in late october @entity20 served as the headliner at a rally for @entity45 lt. governor @entity44 , who was campaigning to become the @entity47 's chief executive at the time , at the @entity49 's @entity49 campus			1
after the event was over , @entity44 's staff claimed that more than a 1,000 supporters came out to see @entity20 , but it was evident that there were far fewer attendees , as most of the nose - bleed seats on one side of the gymnasium were empty , as were areas of the bleachers on the side			1
@entity20 spent a good deal of her time throughout the fall barnstorming the country , attempting to save embattled @entity64 from electoral defeat			2
today denoted one of just a few non-political speeches she 's given since , and she is slated to make remarks at two events in january and february			0
her feb. 24 speech at the first - ever @entity71 has raised eyebrows among politicos as @entity20 has repeatedly promised to make an announcement about her political future at the top of the year			1
once she declares her candidacy for president - if she intends to at all - it would be frowned upon for her to continue charging business executives upward of $ 200,000 for a slice of her time			0
the recently announced february speaking date indicates that @entity20 may wait until early spring to make her decision public			2
a second photo taken by the @entity38 staffer shows empty blocks in the main area of the 750 - person hall , as well polls continue to show @entity20 atop the 2016 field should she follow through on a second presidential run			1
a @entity94 survey released on tuesday shows her decimating her competition in the @entity98 primary and earning 65 percent of her party 's support			1
@entity64 ' second choice , progressive sen. @entity102 of @entity47 , received just 10 percent of the vote in the hypothetical match up			0
trailing @entity105 were vice president @entity106 at nine percent and @entity108 sen. @entity107 at five percent			0
coming in at just one percent were @entity110 gov. @entity109 , @entity47 gov. @entity111 , retiring @entity113 sen. @entity112 and outgoing @entity45 gov. @entity114			0
without @entity20 in the race , @entity106 , a former @entity115 senator , would jump to the top of a plurality of @entity64 ' wish lists , followed by @entity105 , with all other possible contenders failing to earn double - digit support .			2

this is at least the second time in recent weeks that @entity20 has been unable to pack a room during an appearance
the clock is winding down on her self - selected *deadline* to make a decision about whether she wants to carry her party 's torch in 2016
a @entity94 poll released *yesterday* shows her *blowing* her @entity98 competition out the water still
