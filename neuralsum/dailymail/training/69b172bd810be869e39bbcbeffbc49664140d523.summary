coasting schools in middle - class areas will be targeted by government hit squads if they fail to improve , @entity0 warned last night			1
the prime minister said former head teachers could be sent in to turn round schools in affluent areas which inspectors believe should be doing far better			1
he made his pledge ahead of an announcement today of a rescue package for 500 of @entity14 ’s worst schools			1
mr @entity0 will also announce a central pool of the best teachers , who would be sent into failing schools			1
he wants 1,500 such ‘ crack teachers ’ in a @entity37 by 2020			1
in an article for the @entity39 the prime minister warns that the powers would not only be used for failing schools contending with poverty , violence and lack of aspiration in the poorest communities , but also in middle - class areas where schools have no excuses for poor performance			1
he said : ‘ we will look at what they can do for … what i call coasting schools … every day a school fails is a day too long			1
so these measures will happen fast			0
’ the intervention follows a damning @entity60 report warning of a culture of low - level disruption and disrespect in schools			1
the education watchdog said last month that misbehaviour was part of ‘ everyday life ’ in the classroom , with teachers estimating they lose up to an hour a day to indiscipline – equivalent to 38 days ’ teaching a year			2
mr @entity0 said he wanted all parents to have access to schools as good as the state primary his daughter @entity76 attends			1
‘ we all know the difference good teaching makes , ’ he said			0
‘ the moment when an interest was sparked , a subject was mastered , or a career was inspired – these turning points can so often be traced back to one special teacher			0
' so i want every child in @entity88 to have access to great teaching			0
‘ it will remain my mission to give every parent that sense of security – the knowledge that their child ’s education really is helping them to reach their potential and succeed in life			0
’ mr @entity0 will unveil the rescue package alongside education secretary @entity104 today			1
the plans – not signed off by the @entity106 – will be part of the @entity109 manifesto			2
there are already eight ‘ regional schools commissioners ’ including ex-heads , who oversee free schools and academies			2
regional schools commissioners can be sent into coasting schools , and will be given sweeping powers to implement new discipline codes , being in behaviour specialists , and dispose of failing staff mr @entity0 and education secretary @entity104 ( centred ) later posed for a group photograph with almost 200 head teachers from 300 free schools from across the country , at a reception held in @entity127 teachers should take an oath to commit themselves to the values of their profession , says @entity133 ’s @entity132			1
the party ’s education spokesman said it would be like the @entity137 oath taken by doctors and would ‘ elevate ’ teachers ’ status			2
but last night a @entity109 spokesman dismissed the idea as a ‘ patronising gimmick ’			0
mr @entity132 believes the practice would emphasise teachers ’ responsibility ‘ to provide a sense of moral purpose and virtue ’ to pupils			2
he was inspired by an oath taken by teachers in @entity152			2
mr @entity0 wants to expand their reach to immediate intervention in any state school deemed ‘ inadequate ’ by @entity60			1
the @entity157 will be able to instruct schools to implement new policies on standards , discipline and leadership			1
their new powers , which will cover 500 schools with 100,000 pupils , will be developed after consultation with teachers			1
they may include allowing @entity157 to recommend a tariff of punishments for bad behaviour			1
other ideas include bringing in behaviour specialists			1
the experts could make immediate personnel changes to the governing body to improve the calibre of leadership and ensure it has the necessary skills to improve			2
mr @entity0 will also announce that a @entity109 government will set up a @entity182 , a central pool of high - quality teachers who can be seconded to poor - performing schools			1
mrs @entity186 said : ‘ @entity133 failed an entire generation , breaking our education system … our plan for education is clearing up @entity133 ’s mess … targeting the schools where failure has become ingrained			2
' we will not tolerate failure , and where we find it we will use tried and trusted interventions to turn things around in the interests of young people everywhere			2
’ mr @entity0 added : ‘ we want to build a @entity88 with an education system that helps our children reach their potential … that ’s why we ’re going to rescue 500 schools and help 100,000 children get new opportunities			1
’ @entity132 , @entity133 ’s education spokesman , said it was ‘ this government ’s damaging schools policy that has failed pupils ’ , adding that ministers were ‘ trying to play catch - up ’			2
' i want your children to have what @entity76 has , a top rate education in a brilliant state school ' taking my four - year - old daughter @entity76 to school for the first time is something i wo n’t forget			0
all parents know that feeling – the apprehension as you let go of your child ’s hand and watch them run across the playground towards their new friends			0
but what gave me peace of mind , what made it a little easier to walk away , was knowing that @entity76 is being taught at a brilliant state primary school			2
i want for your children what i have for my own , because no child in @entity88 should be born to have a second - rate education			0
we have made good progress , with rigour in the curriculum , discipline in the classroom , and well - respected qualifications on exam certificates			1
because these are n’t just letters on a piece of paper – they ’re our children ’s ticket to a better , brighter future			0
@entity133 failed to do these things			0
subjects like maths and @entity14 were dumbed down			1
the number of teenagers studying academic gcses , like science , halved			0
businesses would n’t employ school leavers because they lacked basic skills			0
and as countries like @entity152 and @entity267 were raising the bar in education , @entity133 just moved the goalposts , making it twice as easy to get an a * or a – with nearly a quarter of all pupils achieving the top grades			0
we are creating more good schools , freeing teachers from the constraints imposed by local councils and establishing 4,200 academies			1
we have helped 250 groups of parents , teachers , charities and businesses set up their own schools – @entity286			1
we have toughened up the @entity287 to make it truly rigorous			0
and our plan is working : 800,000 more children are in good or outstanding schools ; nearly 250,000 fewer are in failing schools			1
there are free schools that are sending as many pupils to @entity295 as independent schools			2
there are former failing schools which , as @entity279 , have become beacons of achievement			1
one is @entity301 ’s in @entity18			0
fourteen years ago , not a single pupil achieved five a * to c grades at @entity304 , including maths and @entity14			1
today , as an @entity17 , it boasts 68 per cent a * to c grades			0
we know the ingredients of a great state school : great teachers , great leadership and an intolerance of failure – and freedom for those great teachers			2
now we want to go further			0
first , we will get more brilliant teachers into the schools that need them most			1
with programmes like @entity321 , more top graduates are training to be teachers than ever before			2
but we will go further			0
a @entity323 will pay the best of the best to work in failing or inadequate schools			1
i want to see 1,500 of these top teachers signed up and in post by 2020			1
that means two in every school ; every child within reach of first - class teaching			0
we all know the difference good teaching makes			0
the moment when an interest was sparked , a subject was mastered , or a career was inspired – these turning points can so often be traced back to one special teacher			0
' the moment when an interest was sparked , a subject was mastered , or a career was inspired - these turning points can so often be traced back to one special teacher ' second , we will get to grips with failing schools			1
there are still too many in our country – 500 of them teaching 100,000 of our children			0
currently there are eight regional school commissioners overseeing all @entity356			0
we will give these experts , who include former teachers , a wider remit : unprecedented powers to overhaul failing schools			1
if it ’s the leadership that ’s not working , they can make them remove it – reappointing the whole governing body if they have to			0
if the curriculum is n’t up to scratch , they can change it			0
they can issue new disciplinary measures for bad behaviour			2
they can pair up failing schools with good local schools			1
and if they succeed , we will look at what they can do for schools that are said to ‘ require improvement ’ – what i call coasting schools			0
when it comes to our children ’s education , we do n’t have a year to waste			0
every day a school fails is a day too long			0
so these measures will happen fast			0
after her first month at school , @entity76 is coming home every day repeating things she has heard her teacher say , excited to learn more			0
it will remain my mission to give every parent that sense of security – the knowledge that their child ’s education really is helping them to reach their potential and succeed in life .			0

@entity0 takes on schools in affluent areas who should be doing better
plans include *talent* pool of 1,500 ' crack teachers ' to send into failing schools
staff would beef up discipline , sack failing staff and improve behaviour
made pledge ahead of package to turn around @entity14 *'s* worst institutions
