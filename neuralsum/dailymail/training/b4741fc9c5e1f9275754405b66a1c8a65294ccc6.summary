children born to obese mothers are 50 per cent more likely to end up in hospital in the first five years of their lives			1
a world - first study by researchers at @entity7 has followed almost 3,000 @entity9 mothers and their children over a five - year period			1
researchers found conditions of the nervous system , infections , metabolic conditions , perinatal conditions , injuries and respiratory conditions were more prevalent in children of obese mothers			1
video courtesy of the @entity25 doctor @entity26 said the study , published in the @entity28 , is good evidence pre-pregnancy weight has direct effect on complications when getting pregnant			1
' we know that there are 1.5 times more hospital admissions in children born to obese mothers than to normal ( weight ) mothers , ' she said			1
dr @entity26 said hopes the findings will lead to more funding to explore the reasons why there 's a link between obese mothers and their children 's health ' we found higher rates of infections and metabolic disorders that came through , but weight did n't seem to be the cause for higher rates of injuries and poisonings			1
' doctor @entity55 hopes to now secure more funding so her team can analyse genetic material to find out why the health problems occur			2
' there 's no evidence long term			2
we have collected cord blood and now have the ability to do further study			2
we are just in the process of seeking further funding , ' she said			0
she also told @entity70 the results are not about blaming women			0
' we 've reached epidemic proportions in obesity , ' she said			0
' this is a way to help support women lose weight , not another reason to blame them			0
it 's a good indication that we have the potential to reduce health care costs with studies like these , with a goal to achieve better health for us and our children			1
' children born to obese mothers are 50 % more likely to be hospitalised			1
' pre-pregnancy weight has direct effect on complications when getting pregnant			1
' dr @entity92 , obstetrics spokesman for the @entity93 , welcomed the findings and said they reinforced what we know from other studies			0
' in a perfect world every pregnancy would be planned and safe with no medical illness , but that 's not the case			2
from this study we want people to start talking about having children and working towards planning a birth , ' she said			2
dr @entity92 said women today are bombarded with a variety of information but education and knowledge to take action is a good thing			0
' whatever we can do as a nation to get people close to the right body weight and image is the best thing we can do			0
all mothers need to know how to be healthy , ' she said			0
' we want mothers to be at optimal weight and the study also shows some underweight mothers have problems too			1
talk and education is the best thing in reassuring mums to be healthy			0
' the study , which finds children with obese mum are more likely to be hospitalised in the first five years of their life , is not to blame mothers but to equip them with the information and knowledge to lead a healthy lifestyle			1
study co-author professor @entity141 from the @entity142 in @entity143 , also told @entity144 the work was significant because the mothers and children were followed over a period of time			2
' this is the million - dollar question			0

obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally , with at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese .			0
