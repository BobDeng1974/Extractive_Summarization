incisive and ful of running even though on left			0
@entity63 7 can feel satisfied with a decent debut			0

@entity128 6.5 part of an immaculate back three for an hour – suddenly looked a little vulnerable as the changes unsettled @entity31			2
@entity110 7 looked imperious until the changes in the last 15 minutes left @entity31 looking a little exposed			2

was great in defence before being wrong footed for the @entity75 chance a minute before being taken off			2
@entity145 6.5 ( @entity146 60 ) solid throughout – was full of running when @entity0 's midfield allowed him space in the first half			1
@entity151 7 able and capable in possession – well on top of @entity0 's midfield for much of the game			1
