by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity2 : 19:00 est , 26 december 2013 @entity3 : 19:44 est , 26 december 2013 a mother who stabbed her baby daughter with a kitchen knife has won the right to stay in @entity8 – so she can stay in touch with the girl she tried to kill			1
the woman was jailed for five years for attempting to murder her daughter when the girl was just eight months old			1
after completing her jail sentence she was due to be deported to her home country of @entity16			1
' an appallingly difficult case ' : a tribunal has ruled that a woman who stabbed her baby girl with a kitchen knife will not be deported because that would separate her from her child ( photo posed by models ) but the family courts gave her the right to see her daughter under tight supervision for an hour three times a year – and she has now won the right to stay in @entity8 permanently			1
a judge ruled it would be ‘ very cruel ’ to stop her from seeing the child			1
she won her case using @entity34 – the right to a private and family life			2
controversial : the decision was made by mr @entity38 when the @entity40 appealed , another judge described the earlier ruling as ‘ generous ’ but refused to overturn it			2
the woman – who can not be named because it would identify the child , came to @entity8 in september 2007 after marrying her cousin in an arranged ceremony the year before			1
despite speaking no @entity48 and having never been to @entity8 before , she moved to be with him in a maisonette in @entity51 , @entity52			1
their daughter was born in june 2008			2
the marriage was unhappy and in march 2009 the 30 - year - old ’s husband presented her with a one - way ticket for her to return to @entity16			1
he also obtained a court order banning her from taking the child out of the country			0
the mother told relatives she would kill the baby and kill herself rather than be separated from her daughter , saying : ‘ if i ca n’t have her then no - one will			1
’ her husband left her alone with the child and returned to find her stabbing the girl in the stomach			0
he grabbed the child and ran upstairs with her – with the mother chasing after him with the knife – before she was overpowered by his brother			2
the @entity75 heard she left a 1.6in stab wound and the baby would have died if the thrust had not caught one of her ribs			2
afterwards the woman asked her husband : ‘ why could n’t you come in later ? then i could have finished her off ? ’ , the court heard			1
the sentencing judge accepted the ticket and the court injunction ‘ came out of the blue and it was a cruel act which left her no room to take advice about her situation ’			0
he also accepted that she was in an ‘ overpowering situation ’ and was facing ‘ huge emotional turmoil ’ – so jailed her for just five years			1
in july 2011 , while still behind bars , she was granted access to her daughter , by then nearly three years old , by the @entity99			2
migration : the woman had moved from @entity16 to @entity51 in east @entity52 , pictured that ruling was made by mr @entity38 , the same judge who , sitting in the @entity103 , allowed doctors to sedate a pregnant woman to perform a caesarean without her consent			1
the child was then a ward of the court – and her mother was allowed to see her three times a year for one hour under strict supervision			0
he wrote that it was ‘ positively in the interests of this little girl for her to see her mother ’			0
he wrote : ‘ from these small beginnings , it may well be that , as time progresses , something more meaningful can be built up , although that will inevitably be a difficult progress given the nature of the crime which was committed by the mother			0
’ when the mother was released from prison in december 2011 she was informed by the @entity40 that she faced deportation because of the horrific attack			0
a tribunal ruled in her favour in march 2013 on the basis of @entity135 , saying removal from @entity8 would ‘ not be proportionate ’			1
judge @entity137 said it would be a ‘ very cruel decision indeed ’ for both the mother and her daughter to ‘ effectively end contact ’ between them			0
the tribunal concluded : ‘ it is entirely appreciated that it is on a very limited basis at the present time but in our view it is overwhelmingly significant that contact has been permitted and endorsed by the courts			2
’ the @entity40 appealed – saying it was in the public interest to deport her			0
shock : the woman was jailed for five years at the @entity75 ( pictured ) but then allowed to see her child in prison before the @entity156 , lawyers for the home secretary argued that the mother had ‘ damaged her daughter emotionally and psychologically and further contact would cause her daughter harm ’			1
they said the child , who is now four and a half , ‘ does not even fully recognise who she is ’ and has only seen her mother on seven occasions since 2010			0
and they said the daughter ‘ may not even want to know her when she is older and knows what has happened ’ and that further contact would cause her daughter further harm			0
but upper tribunal judge @entity174 , while admitting the decision of the lower court was ‘ generous ’ , refused to overturn its ruling in what she described as an ‘ appallingly difficult case ’			2
a @entity40 spokesman said : ‘ we are disappointed and surprised with this verdict and we have applied to the @entity182 for the right to challenge it			0
‘ those who come to the @entity8 must abide by our laws			0
we will take all necessary steps to deport foreign criminals and have introduced tough new rules to protect the public from those who try to stay here through abuse of the @entity192			0
‘ @entity193 will clarify our policy to the courts , that foreign criminals should ordinarily be deported despite their claim to a family life			0

woman was jailed for five years for attempted murder with kitchen knife
she said of her unhappy marriage : ' if i ca n’t have *[* the baby *]* no - one will '
but tribunal ruled deporting her to @entity16 would be *disproportionate*
she moved to @entity51 , east @entity52 , in 2007 after marrying cousin
