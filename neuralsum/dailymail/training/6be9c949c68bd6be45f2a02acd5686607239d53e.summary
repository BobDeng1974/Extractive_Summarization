@entity0 will miss @entity3 ’s @entity2 clash with his old club @entity4 at @entity5 on saturday after being sent for surgery on an achilles problem			1
the 32 - year - old midfielder left the @entity4 on a free transfer in the summer and played in @entity3 ’s first four games of the season , but has not appeared since the goalless draw with @entity13 in august			1
the club ’s medical staff hoped that rest would cure the condition but manager @entity18 revealed that @entity0 is booked in for an operation on monday			1
@entity3 manager @entity18 ( above ) is without midfielder @entity0 for the home match against @entity4 @entity0 ( right ) has not featured for @entity3 since their 0 - 0 draw against @entity13 in august ‘ @entity23 unfortunately is going to have a minor operation , ’ said @entity18			1
‘ he ’s got a niggling achilles and it just has n’t settled down			2
‘ we ’re not sure how long he will be out for			2
we ’ll know more after the operation but we ’re hopeful that he ’ll go in monday			1
‘ it ’s nothing too serious in the grand scheme of things , just something that ’s niggling			2
it ’s a small bony area at the back of his achilles which is irritating it , so that ’s going to have to be done			2
‘ i always follow surgical opinion			0
that was the opinion to allow it time to settle down , but it just has n’t settled to the level that you need to carry on what you ’re doing			0
so we leave that one with the surgeons , that ’s what they ’re paid for			0
’ @entity3 striker @entity48 ( left ) challenges @entity49 ( right ) of @entity50 for the ball @entity52 ( above ) should also return to bolster @entity3 's defence there was better news on the injury front for @entity18 regarding five other players , including last season ’s 26 - goal top scorer @entity48 who could return to action against @entity4			1
@entity48 has missed the last three games with a hamstring strain and @entity18 said : ‘ he ’s had a good week with us so he ’s certainly in the thinking which we ’re pleased about			1
‘ he ’s managed to get on the grass at the beginning of the week as well which is important because he ’s fit to train with the group rather than throw him in at the last minute			0
we just thought it was important to give him a full week ’s training so he definitely comes into the thinking			0
’ @entity52 is fit despite being carried off with an ankle injury in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity75 last time out , and @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 should all be available			0
the match at @entity5 comes too soon for forward @entity81 , who is recovering from a serious knee injury however , @entity81 is still not ready to return while @entity83 and @entity84 are unlikely to be fit to face @entity4			1
‘ @entity81 is going really well , ’ added @entity18			1
‘ there have been some remarks in the papers about him trying to be fit in a month , and i do n’t think that ’s the case			0
you never know but he ’s going along really well			0
‘ there will certainly be no pressure from us			0
we want to make sure he ’s right , fit and well in his own time			0

@entity0 booked in for monday op after rest fails to heal the problem
but @entity3 manager @entity18 could have striker @entity48 back
saturday 's game at home to @entity4 comes too soon for @entity81
