when sir @entity1 described @entity2 as ‘ the bravest man in the world ’ it was enough to make the eyes water			1
not just with tears but also from the wincing recollections which that sentence invoked among the wonderful old footballers gathered in @entity10 to pay their last respects to a legend of the @entity14 game when it was at its most heroic			1
@entity1 ’s was among the more thunderous of the personal reminiscences at @entity2 ’s funeral			1
sir @entity1 gave a moving tribute to @entity19 enforcer @entity2 at his funeral on tuesday @entity1 arrived at @entity22 ' @entity21 earlier in the afternoon prior to leading the tributes @entity1 was in distinguished company , with former @entity26 man @entity25 ( back ) also present supporters lined the streets of @entity10 to give the former midfielder the send - off he deserved @entity30 ( middle ) was @entity32 's representative at the @entity33 the hearse carrying @entity2 's coffin was complete with flowers and a football to mark his passing the cortege leaves @entity22 ' stadium as the city were given the opportunity to pay their final respects the order of service for @entity2 's funeral @entity1 ’s was among the more thunderous of the personal reminiscences at @entity2 ’s funeral			1
' i was playing for @entity50 reserves at @entity21 and the great @entity2 was playing for @entity22 reserves because he was coming back from a broken toe , ' said @entity1 , himself hardly a wilting flower of @entity55 in the physical challenges			1
' he tackled me and i thought " @entity56 "			0
but in those days you had to get up			0
so i got up and had a look at that big barrel chest of his			0
he just said " are you alright , son ? " ' the only time i played against @entity2			2
i ’ll never forget it			0
’ no - one at @entity22 , who @entity2 captained to all three major domestic honours , will ever forget him either			1
hundreds of @entity22 loyalists lined the route of his final journey from the old ground , in company with the players and staff who have just restored the club to the @entity73			2
at @entity76 , the former @entity75 converted into an ornate , stained glass venue for grand occasions like this , sir @entity1 described @entity2 as not only brave but ‘ humble '			1
the iconic image of @entity2 confronting @entity82 of @entity83 during in august 1966 @entity85 's @entity84 grabs hold of @entity2 during a 1968 @entity88 match @entity2 pictured during a training session at @entity32 's @entity91 ground in 1967 click here to read @entity94 's tribute to @entity2 : enshrined in @entity32 folklore as ' the heartbeat ' , his iron man demeanour obscured a cultured player adored by the fans he entertained			1
he added : ‘ humility is embraced by great people and @entity2 did that thoroughly			2
’ this was not an entirely @entity105 homage			0
@entity2 won not only his homeland ’s @entity106 but also its @entity109 equivalent			2
the latter recognised his captaining of a quite wondrous @entity32 team to the first post-war @entity113 double			2
the bravest man in the world ? unquestionably one of the bravest in the world of football			0
he came back from breaking the same leg twice – both horrific fractures – to inspire @entity125 ‘ glory , glory ’ for @entity32			0
the humblest ? perhaps his modesty worked against him attracting the attention of those who selected the @entity55 team back in the hey - day			0
‘ only 22 caps for a player as good as that ? ’ @entity1 lamented			1
‘ @entity55 was picked by a committee with its head in the sand			0
’ a @entity2 scarf displayed in the back of a car in respect of the former @entity55 international @entity25 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 were among other @entity105 icons nodding in accord			1
from way south of the border came these @entity32 celebrants of 80 years lived with uncompromising gallantry on the pitch and uncommon courtesy off it – @entity30 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161			1
pick a team from those two glittering histories			0
but when so doing reflect on something else spoken by @entity1 : ‘ they talk about his great courage but he was a fantastic , skilful footballer whose intensity and desire to win would make any team			0
’ and keep a place for @entity2 .			0
