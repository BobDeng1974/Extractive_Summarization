@entity1 had aided and abetted crimes committed by @entity46 and @entity48 rebels , while knowing well the kinds of crimes they were committing			1

thousands more were left mutilated in a conflict that became known for its extreme cruelty , as rival rebel groups hacked off the limbs of their victims and carved their groups ' initials into opponents			0
the rebels developed gruesome terms for the mutilations , offering victims the choice of ' long sleeves ' or ' short sleeves ' - having their hands hacked off or their arms sliced off above the elbow			2

that is not happening simply because of political reasons			0
' had @entity1 had as friends any of the five permanent members of the @entity216 ... this case i dare say would probably not have had the sort of traction it had			0
' because @entity213 is not a member of the @entity219 , only the @entity216 asking the court to investigate could trigger jurisdiction there			0
the reaction back home : men gather at a popular downtown @entity236 tea shop known as a hotspot for political debate to watch the announcement of today 's appeal verdict and @entity1 's supporters in @entity6 remained loyal to the former warlord who was later democratically elected the country 's president			1
