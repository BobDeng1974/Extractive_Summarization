however neither realized the drama that was just about to unfold but , no sooner had they put they key into the lock that the diamond fell down onto the wooden platform , slipping straight through the gaps			2
' within seconds we were all on our hands and knees , our eyes pressed between the wooden planks , searching for the delicate diamond ring â€“ a diamond in the rough , ' @entity12 wrote on a blog she set up about the experience			2
' ( then ) 40 feet below us , on an industrial platform inaccessible to the public , we spotted the ring			1
' one of their friends ran to some nearby @entity59 officers , @entity60 and @entity61 , who came to assess the situation , according to the @entity63			1
' they were confused at first , but soon understood our plight and committed to getting the ring back to us if it was in their power to do so , ' @entity12 wrote			0
@entity7 's finest : thankfully , two nearby officers agreed to help , and hatched a plan to get the ring back rescue - in - progress : the two officers walked back to @entity6 , got in there car , drove to the spot where the ring fell , and parked success ! : after a few minutes , officer @entity60 emerged with the ring and a big thumbs up ' after much deliberation about their method , they walked back to @entity6 , drove across the bridge , and stopped saturday afternoon @entity7 traffic so they could park and make their descent			1
' a few minutes later , officer @entity60 emerged with the thumbs up			0
the ring was in his hand			0
the cops then met the women back in @entity6 , where they were reunited with the ring			0
@entity13 then re-proposed to @entity12 on firm ground , and she said yes			2
' there 's a lot of hatred and negativity towards our community ; we 're certain it will be generations before that is eradicated , ' @entity12 put in the blog post			0
' that 's why we felt it important to share our story , to provide a bit of hope that there is good out there too			0
' congratulations : the women could not thank the two officers enough for getting the ring back			0

@entity12 and @entity13 were *visiting* @entity7 from @entity115 last month when @entity13 decided to propose
but the ring fell through the wooden *slacks* of @entity6 and onto a platform about 40 feet below
they found two @entity59 officers who went to great *lengths* to retrieve it
@entity13 proposed - again - and @entity12 said yes
