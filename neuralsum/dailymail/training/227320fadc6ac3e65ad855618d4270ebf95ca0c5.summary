by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 09:25 est , 21 march 2012 the @entity1 might have hit the fatal iceberg because of a rare weather condition that created a ' fake horizon ' , leaving the crew unaware of the threat until it was too late			1
the same rare phenomenon , found by a historian studying studying weather records unseen for a century , might also have meant that a nearby ship , @entity11 , was unaware of the scale of the disaster and failed to save passengers from the stricken liner			1
the ' cold weather mirage ' occurs when a cold weather front collides with warmer air and causes light passing between the boundary of the two to be bent dramatically , distorting how an object appears			1
photograph showing the iceberg which sank the @entity1 : a @entity25 historian now believes that a rare ' cold weather mirage ' might have concealed the fatal iceberg until it was too late the @entity1 , built by @entity27 in @entity28 , 4th february 1912 , preparing to leave for @entity29 for her maiden voyage to @entity32 on april 10th 1912			1
the steamship sank on april 15th 1912 off the coast of @entity35 @entity36 played by @entity37 in the new tv series of @entity1 look - outs on - board the @entity1 could not see the approaching iceberg because the optical illusion created a fake horizon above sea level which concealed it from view			2
the theory also explains why @entity48 , captain of the nearest ship @entity11 , ignored the sinking vessel because the illusion made it look like a much smaller ship			0
@entity25 historian and author @entity54 outlines his findings in a tv documentary for @entity58 to be aired			1
he claims his theory ties not only with weather records but also with eyewitness accounts			2
he said : ‘ it does actually make me feel sorry for captain lord , knowing now what i know about the science of that @entity66 he is apparently making excuses , saying the ship he was looking at did not look anything like the @entity1 , what i now understand is that he was telling the exact @entity75 fact , what he was looking at did not look anything like the @entity1 at all			0
’ unusually high - pressure weather also played a part in the tragedy , according to mr @entity54			2
‘ a weather chart of the @entity82 from april 1912 reveals that the @entity1 actually sank right in the centre of a 1,035 - millibar @entity84 high			2
‘ to put that into context , that is the highest pressure anywhere in the northern hemisphere			0
‘ so this menacing @entity84 high which built up over the @entity91 swung down and zeroed in on @entity1 's crash site			0
‘ it 's almost as though the @entity1 sank in a killing zone of nature where all these dangerous elements combined to make it fatal			1
’ contemporary painting illustrating the sinking of the @entity1 , @entity1 after it struck an iceberg whilst sailing south of the @entity101 on april 14 1912 @entity102 played by @entity103 and @entity104 played by @entity105 in the new tv series of @entity1 the actual iceberg which sank the liner titanic in april 1912 photograaphed from the @entity110 ship @entity111 mr @entity54 , 39 , from @entity112 , unearthed weather records and the logs of other ships in the @entity82 at the time that have remained unseen in archives for a century			1
along with survivors ' testimony , he pieced together how the tragedy most likely unfolded on that fateful night on april 15 , 1912			0
using contemporary records , mr @entity54 discovered the ship sank at the exact location and time that freezing waters from the @entity84 flowing along the @entity126 met hotter air from the @entity128			2
and because this bent the light rays passing through the air at this point - completely obscuring the iceberg on the horizon - the doomed liner sailed directly towards it for a full 20 minutes , when under normal circumstances it would have been in clear view of the look - outs			1
mr @entity54 - author of the book ' 101 things you thought you knew about @entity142 ... but did n't ! ' - said his mirage theory also explains why captain @entity48 , whose ship @entity11 was just 10 miles away , did not attempt a rescue because the illusion made the @entity1 look like a much smaller ship			0
mr @entity54 said the 1,500 people who died in the disaster could still have been saved even after the collision with the iceberg but the cold - water mirage made the ship 's @entity155 lamp signals appear to the crew of the @entity158 to be the mast flickering under the stars or ordinary lights on the deck			1
‘ i 've spent years wondering why these two ships which were trying to @entity155 each other all night could n't communicate , ’ said mr @entity54			0
‘ a phenomenon known as scintillation scrambled @entity1 's @entity155 lamp signals and it meant that the nearby ship , instead of realising it was the @entity1 and coming straight to her aid , never came to her aid			0
’ @entity172 is the same effect that makes stars appear to twinkle as the light is distorted when it passes through the @entity177 's atmosphere			0
mr @entity54 said the logs of @entity110 and @entity25 ships near the area at the time recorded a massive drop in temperature around the site of the sinking , which he believes is proof that the conditions were perfect to create a mirage that would have hidden an iceberg from view			1
he added that survivors ' testimony backed this up , particularly those who recalled seeing a column of smoke rise from the sinking ship before flattening out like a mushroom cloud , which indicates a large difference in the layers of air pressure and temperature			0

' killing zone of nature ' , says @entity25 scientist
@entity208 would have been unable to see iceberg until too late
@entity212 ' cold weather mirage ' caused by cold front colliding with warmer air
