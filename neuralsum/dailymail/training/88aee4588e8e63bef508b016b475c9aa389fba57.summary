by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 16:57 est , 26 june 2013 a @entity2 housekeeper has accused a top @entity4 official of treating her like a virtual slave			1
@entity6 , 40 , is suing @entity7 , the first secretary of the @entity2 mission , and her husband , @entity10 , claiming the couple lured her from @entity12 , @entity12 to the @entity13 with the promise of fair wages and a humane work schedule but when she arrived it was all a sham			1
according to ms @entity17 , she was given just one day off every six weeks and could only leave the house to pick up the couple 's children			2
all the while she was being bullied and coerced by the pair , she said in a lawsuit filed in @entity24			0
trafficking : @entity6 , pictured , is suing her former employer , an official in @entity12 's @entity4 mission , for labor trafficking ' i do n't want others to go through what i did , ' she told @entity31			1
ms @entity32 and mr @entity33 have vehemently rejected the human trafficking allegations , adding that they were ' surprised ' by what the woman , who they 'd known for a decade , claimed happened			0
ms @entity17 worked for the couple in @entity40 in the early 2000s and late in @entity12 but did not complain about their treatment during those postings			1
however , she claims a contract she signed with her employers before coming to the @entity13 in october 2012 , which promised weekends and overtime pay , was entirely disregarded			1
under the terms of the contract , according to the @entity31 , she would be paid $ 9.82 per hour to work as a ' housekeeper ' for seven hours a day , five days a week and if any overtime would be paid at $ 14.73 per hour			2
she also was promised sick days and 15 paid vacation days per year , as well as three meals a day , six days a week , the lawsuit states			0
but as soon as she arrived , the contract was thrown out the window she claims , and she was forced to work from dawn to 10 p.m. not only cleaning the two - story , four - bedroom house but also to cook for the family of six			1
she had to care and change the youngest child , who was 18 - months , and drive the older children to and from school			0
diplomat : @entity64 , the first secretary of the @entity2 mission to the @entity4 , pictured , and her husband , @entity10 allegedly treated their housekeeper like a virtual slave she was also required to tend to house guests and the garden , she claims and was only given ' very basic food , like bread and coffee , ' meaning she ' frequently was hungry			1
' the agreed wage also turned out to be a lie , according to @entity79			0
instead of the $ 9.82 an hour promised , she said the couple told her they would pay her a flat rate of $ 900 a month , slashing the earnings she had been expecting			2
but even that did n't happen she claims			2
according to ms @entity17 , she said she only got several hundred dollars each month after the couple deducted cash to cover the cost of clothing and toiletries they bought her			0
she was also only given four days off in six months , she said , and was confined to the home where she was subjected to ' verbal abuse and psychological coercion			0
' on april 27 , it got too much and ms @entity17 called a national human trafficking hot line that was listed in documents she had been given at the @entity13 embassy in @entity12			1
she ran away , seeking refuge at @entity101 , an agency in @entity102 that helps crime victims			0
the organization gave her counseling and a lawyer , who presumably helped with the suit			0
the lawsuit said ms @entity17 is seeking unspecified back wages and damages for trafficking and breach of contract and she wants her belongings back .			2

@entity6 , 40 , is suing @entity64 and her husband , @entity10 for back pay and damages
she claims the couple lured her from @entity12 , @entity12 to the @entity13 with the promise of fair wages and a humane work schedule
but instead she was forced to work long hours , with no weekends on ' virtually no pay '
