by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:41 est , 3 february 2014 @entity4 products do n't have the best track record when it comes to battery life , so it 's no surprise the firm is said to be looking at alternative ways to power future devices - especially its @entity12			1
reports in the @entity14 claim the first - generation smartwatch will be charged wirelessly , using existing technologies currently used with select smartphones and cases			1
yet future models of the wrist - worn technology may even be powered by solar or kinetic energy to make sure they never lose charge			1
reports claim the first model will be charged wirelessly , while future models may be powered by solar or kinetic energy speculation around @entity4 's @entity12 began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013			1
@entity38 websites reported in december 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip - maker @entity40 on a wrist - worn gadget			0
it was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use @entity44 to communicate with other devices , including an @entity46			0
other rumours suggest the @entity12 will feature @entity49 voice controls that let users dictate messages , rather than use the tiny screen			2
the watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video , on the phone or tablet			0
in july last year , reports in the @entity60 said @entity4 was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its @entity12			1
further reports in september claimed @entity4 was struggling to make a number of @entity12 components , meaning the release date would be pushed back			1
solar panels could be fitted underneath the display of the @entity12 , for example , and harness the sun 's energy			2
@entity73 , for example , already uses solar technology in its g - shock range of watches that can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch			2
this is further supported by the fact that in september , @entity4 posted a job vacancy looking for someone with solar expertise			2
other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen and run the next - generation of @entity4 software , likely to be called @entity90 8			1
all these current claims back up the plans laid out in an @entity4 patent filed in 2011			0
the patent described a ' wearable accessory device ' with a ' flexible display ' that could use the same technology as a child 's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user 's wrist			0
it also detailed a method in which the battery life could be extended , including a ' solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device ' , or ' a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches			0
' these current claims confirm plans laid out in an 2011 @entity4 patent			2
the patent described a ' wearable device ' with a ' flexible display ' that could use the same technology as a child 's slap wrap , patent image pictured			0
its battery life could be extended , using a ' solar panel array ' , or ' a kinetic power source other watchmakers , including @entity73 , already use solar technology in their products			0
for example , the @entity128 , pictured , can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch ' an accessory device designed to be worn on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power generation , and could lengthen the amount of time between charging , ' the application continued			0
similarly , a patent filed in 2009 detailed how @entity4 wanted to harness kinetic energy from the movement of an arm or leg as the wearer was walking			1
the curved screen and design rumours were bolstered by a further patent , awarded last year , which gave @entity4 the option to install a flexible battery into future products			1
last week , reports claimed @entity156 was also looking at adding a curved screen to its own next - generation smartwatch , dubbed @entity159 2			1
the original watch launched in september last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life			0
elsewhere , other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen , similar to the concept images pictured , and run the next - generation of @entity4 software , likely to be called @entity90 8 some analysts claimed the device was rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market , beating @entity4 and @entity172 to their respective rumoured devices			1
whereas @entity4 may have delayed its own smartwatch release to learn as much about what customers liked , and did n't like , in the @entity156 version			0
since the first @entity4 @entity12 rumours emerged in 2012 , a number of artists have created concept images of what it may look like			1
many resembled the square and clunky design of @entity156 ’s @entity159 , yet the latest images from @entity187 designer @entity186 imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device			0
@entity186 took inspiration from fitness bands , as well as the look and functionality of @entity4 ’s @entity193 , to create a watch that is ‘ like something @entity4 would actually produce			0
' the concept watch is shown as a simple band , fitted round the wrist like the @entity199 , with a curved touchscreen			0
previous @entity12 concept images , including this one from @entity203 magazine , featured a square screen , and a clunky design , that more closely resembled @entity156 's @entity159 smartwatch @entity156 beat @entity4 to the smartwatch market when it released its @entity208 - powered @entity159 , pictured , in september			1
however , its design , functionality and battery life has been heavily criticised and experts believe @entity4 may have delayed its @entity12 release to learn more about what customers like , and do n't like			2

reports claim the first - generation @entity4 @entity12 will be wirelessly charged
future models could then be powered using solar or kinetic energy
other rumours hint the smartwatch will have a curved screen and run @entity90 8
@entity4 is yet to confirm it is working on smartwatch product but experts believe it will go on sale later this year
