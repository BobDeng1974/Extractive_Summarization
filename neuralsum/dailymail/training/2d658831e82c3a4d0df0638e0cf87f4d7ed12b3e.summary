by @entity0 published : 14:19 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 19:57 est , 13 february 2013 a bus company has started charging dogs £ 1 for every trip			2
@entity4 has come under fire from angry owners after it introduced the tickets , which cost twice as much as a child ’s 50p fare			1
the firm , based in @entity11 , says it is responding to complaints about passengers who block the aisles with more than one dog			2
@entity23 , whose brother regularly travels with his pets , said : ‘ there was nothing put up at bus stops to warn people			0
one person took three dogs on a bus and it cost them £ 7.50 including their fare			1
that ’s a lot of money			0
surprise canine fare : @entity4 justified the charge by saying many passengers bring dogs on their services , and it is only fair they should pay for their extra travellers ( stock picture ) ‘ i ’ve been told there are five dogs that go on the buses regularly , but i do n’t think that ’s enough to start charging			1
’ @entity43 , from @entity4 , said : ‘ we ’re not going to charge for guide dogs			1
' but some people take three dogs and block the back seats so we have to charge something			1
’ the company , which runs thirteen routes in @entity52 and @entity53 , confirmed there had only been one complaint			0
@entity56 , a retired resident from @entity57 , @entity53 , said : ' dog ownership is very high here in @entity53 and in @entity52			0
' but not many people take them on the bus so i 'm not sure it will really raise much money from fares '			0
the average weekly salary in @entity52 is 25 per cent less than the average across @entity69 , at only £ 375.20			0
the @entity71 bus company had charged dogs in @entity73 50p per journey , but it decided to let them travel free in 2007 - as long as they were accompanied by their owner			2
rural community : locals in the town of @entity11 and the surrounding countryside , where @entity4 operates its buses , are angry at the surprise introduction of the dog tariff			1

@entity4 *defends* the fare because dogs ' block access to the back seats '
locals are angry and surprised that they were not warned of the new charge
