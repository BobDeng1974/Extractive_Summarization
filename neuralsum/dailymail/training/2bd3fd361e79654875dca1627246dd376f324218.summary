former lorry driver @entity0 , 58 , is taking his neighbour to court in a bid to settle a bitter boundary dispute over a 3ft strip of land a £ 15.5 million lottery jackpot winner is taking his neighbour to court in a bid to settle a bitter boundary dispute over a 3ft strip of land - for just a few thousand pounds			1
former lorry driver @entity0 , 58 , and his wife @entity12 , 56 , won the multi-million pound windfall in 2001			2
they moved into a luxury £ 480,000 luxury barn conversion with two acres of land in the picturesque village of @entity19 , @entity20 but after retreating to the countryside , mr @entity0 became embroiled in a bitter turf war over a tiny plot of grass which skirts around the southern edge of his property			1
sections of the disputed area are owned by three neighbouring businesses but nobody can agree who owns the 3ft ( 0.9m ) wide strip of land that runs for just 150 metres along the boundary			0
incredibly , mr @entity0 is now taking restaurant owner @entity36 to court over the ' petty ' dispute which is expected to cost him thousands of pounds in legal bills			1
his demands , which are detailed in a county court claim form , include £ 900 for putting up a new fence			2
the lottery winner also wants additional costs for repairing the sewer system , damages for alleged trespass and all legal costs and fees			1
the former @entity53 driver says mr @entity36 , who owns the @entity55 restaurant to the south of his property , demolished his boundary fence in april 2012			1
he also alleges the neighbour tampered with a manhole cover that sealed a foul drainage system - causing raw sewage to flood his paddock and driveway			2

he also says it was mr @entity0 driving wooden fence posts into the ground that caused the dirty contents of the burst sewage pipe to flood back onto his own land			2
vowing to fight for the small plot of grass today , mr @entity36 , 39 , said : ' as far as i am concerned the land belongs to me			1
' when he put up the fence he moved the posts a few yards onto my land and it caused all the damage to the sewers			0
' i had to take it down to get the manhole cover repaired			0
the job cost me thousands of pounds to fix a problem he caused			0
' neighbour @entity103 , 61 , whose home is sandwiched between mr @entity0 's luxury barn conversion and @entity55 , added : ' i have seen the plans and in my opinion the land does not belong to mr @entity0			1
' the boundary is a straight line running the length of his property up to @entity113			0
' he is trying to say there is a dog leg but the plans do n't show that at all			0
' plush : lottery winner @entity0 's £ 480,000 property near @entity19 , @entity20 mr @entity36 , owner of @entity55 , disputes the claims and says the millionaire illegally put up the boundary fence in 2012 in a bid to claim land that did n't belong to him the two parties tried to sort out their differences through mediation in may this year but talks broke down			1
and now , @entity130 , who is from @entity131 representing mr @entity0 , confirmed the claim was going through the court process			1
he declined to comment on the details but speaking in february this year mr @entity0 , who says he still plays the lottery every week , claimed the land belonged to his property			1
the millionaire , who spent £ 375,000 on the barn in april 2002 , said : ' it may look like a straight line on the map but that 's because the drawings are so small			2
' i have photographs showing where the original boundary was and the original owner of the land has backed me up			0
' the restaurant owner flattened my fence and left my land in a terrible state when he employed workmen to raise a manhole cover two years ago			1
' it 's quite simple really			0
i want my land back and my fence put back up			0
' earlier this year , residents accused mr @entity0 of having ' nothing better to do ' since retiring from his job as a @entity53 driver following the huge jackpot win			2
@entity162 , who runs @entity163 , added : ' these disputes have n't really affected us so far but he 's not short of land that 's for sure			0
' i suspect he 's just doing it because he has nothing better to be doing these days			0
' the case is now due to be heard at @entity169 early next year .			0
