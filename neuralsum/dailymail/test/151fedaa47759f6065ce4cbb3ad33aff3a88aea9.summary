but before the snowman withered away , he became somewhat of an internet celebrity , with more than 3,000 people liking the page the family dedicated to their carrot - nosed friend on @entity19			2
since then , the snowman 's height has fluctuated as late winter storms have continued to dump snow even into march			1
he says he has kept the snowman alive with his teen daughter @entity42			1
' it started out as a small project for fun , and it 's morphed into the ongoing snow saga , and it 's a great thing that makes everybody smile and happy , and we 're having fun with it still , ' mr @entity27 told @entity50 last week			2
keeping winter alive : @entity27 went to a local park every day to collect melting snow by the bucket - full to add to his snowman last ditch effort : mr @entity27 pictured adding to the snowman last week , when the weather was so warm he was wearing a tank top but since the beginning of april , the snowman began shrinking and the family started a @entity19 page asking for ' snownations ' to keep their beloved @entity10 alive			1
' i wo nâ€™t take snow from an ice skating rink or any artificial snow , ' mr @entity27 said			0
