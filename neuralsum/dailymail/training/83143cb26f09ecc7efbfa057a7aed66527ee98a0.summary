by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 20:31 est , 5 november 2013 a @entity3 donor and close friend of @entity5 paid almost £ 40million in bribes to secure business contracts worth billions , a court was told			2
@entity8 , 70 , is accused of passing money to a member of the @entity12 royal family in exchange for huge aluminium contracts			1
the @entity16 - born metals magnate allegedly issued orders for the payments using a fax machine at his home in @entity21 , @entity22			0
@entity8 is also accused of paying the company 's chief executive @entity23 around £ 3million in bribes until he left the business in 2005 one of the alleged recipients was @entity28 , the minister of oil and industry and chairman of state - owned @entity32 ( @entity33 )			1
another was @entity33 chief executive @entity23 , 61 , who received £ 3million in kickbacks which he spent on luxury property			2
prosecutor @entity37 said the bribes were paid over eight years up to 2006 to win business for companies in which @entity8 had an interest			1
he told @entity42 : ‘ corruption on any scale , particularly such as this , destroys the fair market place			0
’ @entity8 has been close to @entity3 for years , pouring money into party causes and enjoying a warm friendship with mr @entity5 and @entity49			2
opening the case at @entity42 , prosecutor @entity37 said : ' this case is about corruption			0
it is corruption , we suggest , on a very large scale			0
' in a nutshell our case is that over the course of about eight years between 1998 and 2006 this defendant , @entity8 , made corrupt payments totalling the @entity63 equivalent of about £ 40million to the chairman @entity28 and the chief executive officer @entity23 , of one of @entity12 's largest companies , @entity32 ( @entity33 )			1
' these payments , we say , were corruptly made in order to win business for companies who hoped to trade with @entity33			2
' during that period mr @entity8 was engaged in negotiations with contracts made between @entity33 and companies in which he had an interest in respect of the products and components associated with the production of aluminium			1
' you will hear that many of the instructions to banks to make corrupt payments were made by mr @entity8 in @entity22 , using a fax machine which clearly bears his details , so most of the fraud was carried out here			1
' he added : ' it is clear there was no legitimate purpose for such payments to be made by mr @entity8			2
' corruption on any scale , particularly on this scale , is such that it destroys the fair marketplace			0
' companies who are prepared to engage in such unlawful conduct get an unfair advantage over competitors and prevent honest and hard working companies from conducting business on an equal footing			0
' the trial is is expected to continue into next year at @entity42			0
the businessman denies all charges the court heard @entity33 accounts for 10 per cent of @entity12 's @entity110 ( gdp ) and nearly 70 per cent of its non-oil exports			1
its shares are three quarters owned by the @entity12 government			0
as chairman @entity28 had a ' significant influence ' over contracts awarded by @entity33 , it was said			1
but as the @entity120 has no extradition treaty with @entity12 the @entity28 could not be made to stand trial here , jurors were told			1
mr @entity123 said the payments were largely made or received through companies controlled by @entity8 and the @entity28			1
' it is pursuant to a criminal conspiracy , ' he added			1
@entity8 , has dual @entity129 and @entity120 citizenship and lives in @entity21 , central @entity22 , was questioned about the payments by the @entity131 in 2010 but made no comment			2
he later claimed the money transfers were made in respect of sponsorship payments to the @entity12 government			0
but the prosecutor said there was no such practice in @entity12 and such acts ' were not only unheard of but unlawful			0
' @entity8 , who has hearing problems and was allowed to sit outside the dock , denies six counts of corruption , one of conspiracy to corrupt and one of transferring criminal property			1
the case , which is expected to go into next year , continues			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
