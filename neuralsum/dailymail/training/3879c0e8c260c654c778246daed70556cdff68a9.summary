according to @entity39 , at the height of their legal disputes , @entity40 admitted she hired a private investigator to prove @entity28 ' did not properly secure the pool and play areas at his home , ' which she alleges endangered the couple 's young son			1
the warring pair also previously argued over ' potty - training ' their son and the actress ’s ex claimed he was never notified of the birth , and instead read about it in online reports			2
he put out a statement soon after the birth that said : ' i was never informed by @entity2 about the birth of our daughter , nor was i invited to attend			0
' in fact , i found out about it through @entity150 reports like everyone else			0
although this sickens me , i am of course overjoyed that our baby was born healthy			0
