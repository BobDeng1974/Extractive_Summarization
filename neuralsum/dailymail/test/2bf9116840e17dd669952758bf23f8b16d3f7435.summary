rangers insist that their fans have no cause for alarm over badges and other trademarks being registered with @entity6 — as they will return to the club when a £ 5million loan is repaid			2
the @entity10 board last week launched a probe into claims @entity14 ’s firm had taken ownership of intellectual property , including the club ’s famous crests			1
however , they are satisfied the position stems solely from the security attached to the loan from @entity6 , accepted by the former regime in january			1
‘ it has been widely reported that the trademarks , the iconic symbols of our club , are now in the possession of @entity6 , ’ said a club statement			2
‘ although the trademarks are registered in @entity6 ’s name , the position is not as alarming as it may first appear			1
@entity33 owner @entity14 is a divisive figure north and south of the border ‘ @entity0 remain the rightful and legal owners of their trademarks and interim chairman @entity37 has clarified this position with @entity6			2
both parties will come together within the next two weeks for talks			0
‘ confusion over ownership arose last week when it was noticed on a government intellectual property site that they appeared to be the possessions of @entity6 but this was as a consequence of the loan facility entered into by the previous board			1
in return for the loan , @entity6 took security over all @entity0 assets — but not @entity10 — including intellectual property owned by the club			1
‘ in @entity57 , it is possible to secure such rights by a fixed charge , but in @entity62 , the equivalent of an @entity57 fixed charge can only be granted over heritable property — land and buildings			0
the @entity0 board have reassured fans that the club still owns trademarks and the badge ‘ accordingly , a practice has developed of lenders taking absolute transfers subject to a back - letter setting out that the transfer is in security and the property will be returned when the facility has been repaid			0
this is a common device adopted by most of the @entity78 banks and lenders			0
‘ @entity0 supporters can be reassured that @entity6 fully accept that all of the ip rights registered in their name will be returned to the club when the loan facility of £ 5million is repaid			0
’ @entity85 wears the club 's famous badge on his shirt as he gestures during an outing for @entity0			0
