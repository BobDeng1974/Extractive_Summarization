for @entity3 , the nature of this catastrophic @entity2 defeat was bad enough			1
yet they can take solace from one sobering fact : but for poor penalty taking and @entity9 they could , indeed should , have lost six			0
bluntly , this was as close to another @entity11 as the @entity13 side have come			0
reduced to ten men by a red card for @entity17 before half - time , the ten men kept the score down to four			1

booked : @entity59 , @entity62 , @entity66 sent off : @entity17 goal : @entity60 8 referee : @entity74 ( @entity75 ) yet as things stand @entity20 ’s side are all but out of the @entity2			1
the debate over a lack of investment in new players will now reach a deafening crescendo to eclipse the incessant din of an ecstatic @entity26 support in the @entity85 last night			0
they will make optimistic noises			0
they will speak of overhauling this deficit and scoring three at their @entity92 ‘ home ’			2
yet the evidence they can do so while keeping the back door shut is scant			0
after a risky team selection , @entity20 watched his team capitulate in alarming fashion here , losing two goals in the final six minutes on a night when @entity26 ’s @entity101 also missed two penalties – @entity9 saving the second			1
the chances of @entity106 ’s champions reaching the group stages of the @entity2 now look wafer thin			2
they hauled back a 2 - 0 deficit to @entity110 last season , but with the excellent @entity24 in their ranks , @entity113 ’s champions are a level above the @entity117 team			1
on another catastrophic @entity118 night for @entity17 the @entity119 defended poorly for 44 minutes before recklessly chopping down @entity30 on the edge of the area in a goalscoring position			1
the decision by the @entity125 referee @entity74 to show a red card was correct			0
by then @entity3 were already 2 - 1 down after the @entity26 dangerman @entity24 ran the @entity13 side ragged with a double			1
the loss of the @entity119 was a blow , but a mixed blessing after a hopeless performance			0
one which left the @entity136 champions horribly and hopelessly @entity137 – instrumental in landing @entity17 in trouble in the first place - moved into the centre of defence in the second half			1
taking advantage : @entity24 ( second left ) pokes home from close range to give @entity26 a first half lead back on track : @entity24 ( left ) celebrates scoring @entity26 's equaliser fine start : @entity60 ( left ) had opened the scoring for @entity3 early smiles : @entity60 celebrates his strike with @entity3 team - mates but the captain almost made things worse when he gifted @entity26 a penalty in 58 minutes , a lazy leg allowing @entity47 to crumple in the box			1
@entity9 went one way and penalty taker @entity101 went the other			0
thankfully for @entity3 the spot kick flew past the post			1
@entity9 would later guess right when the same player took a second penalty in the dying moments of this painful encounter to save further embarrassment			0
how this night of humiliation transpired for @entity3 is difficult to fathom			1
like the boardroom spending policy , @entity20 ’s team selection will certainly come in for sharp scrutiny in the coming days			1
the @entity171 raised eyebrows by throwing new signing @entity63 in for a baptism of fire just 48 hours after joining the club on loan			1
after 63 minutes he made way for @entity64 , the left back left out to make way for right - back @entity55			2
on a bewildering night nothing could fix this mess			0
@entity60 putting @entity3 ahead in seven minutes			1
@entity60 scored the winning goal on his @entity118 debut in @entity187 and followed that by smashing @entity3 into the lead with strong echoes of the goal in @entity191			1
the 20 - year - old received the ball from @entity65 on the right flank and cut inside the left back @entity41 keeping his composure to keep moving and smash a rising left - foot shot inside the left - hand post of @entity37 from 18 yards			0
reprieve : skipper @entity199 ( left ) sends his penalty wide for @entity26 in the thick of it : @entity3 's @entity63 was making his debut for the @entity203 down but not quite out : @entity3 's @entity61 fight for the ball while down on the turf with @entity38 running the line : @entity47 ( right ) of @entity26 tracks @entity58 ( centre ) of @entity3 battle for the ball : @entity3 's @entity55 ( centre ) tries to keep possession from @entity26 captain @entity199			1
for @entity3 it was a start they could barely have scripted			2
yet the twist in the first - half tale was swift , brutal and suicidal			2
even when the visitors scored @entity26 ’s support never let up			0
their fervour was swiftly rewarded when their team levelled within three minutes through the lively and irrepressible @entity24			1
played in by @entity42 on the right of the area , the striker should have been closed down quickly by @entity17 , but found time and space to strike an angled shot through @entity9			1
for @entity3 the equaliser was unfortunate , but no disaster			2
in attack they carried a presence , @entity61 almost striking the @entity136 back into the lead in 23 minutes with a clever twist and turn which ended in a shot over the bar			0
yet the main threat to @entity3 ’s hopes was self inflicted			2
@entity57 almost gifted a goal in 31 minutes , a slack pass in his own area allowed @entity47 a run on goal			0
it needed sharpness and pace from @entity247 – who had a fine game here - to get across and cover for the @entity250			0
but in 36 minutes @entity26 scored a second			0
again , the defending from the team in green shirts was alarming			0
a lofted cross to the back post picked out @entity30 , his header back across goal a meat and drink affair for @entity17 until the @entity119 slipped			2
@entity24 could scarcely believe his luck as the ball dropped perfectly for a smash into the net from ten yards out			2
there was misfortune in what happened to @entity17 , perhaps			2
but in common with other @entity118 nights – most notably against @entity269 in the last 16 and against @entity270 in a 6 - 1 defeat – he had a pretty dismal night here			0
the misery of the @entity275 defender was complete when he was red - carded before the interval , @entity59 ’s failure to control the ball in midfielder allowing @entity30 to nick in and slide the ball past the @entity119 as he lunged in late			2
glum : injured @entity3 captain @entity282 ( centre ) looks on from pitchside rebuilding reputation : former @entity286 boss @entity285 was in charge of @entity26 lining up : @entity3 pose for a photograph before the third round @entity2 qualifier keeping close eyes : @entity3 boss @entity20 observes his side during the warm up it was a red card , no question			1
one which left @entity3 in an invidious and increasingly fraught @entity66 ’s arrival at half - time for @entity65 was intended to shore things up			1
yet @entity26 blew two wonderful chances to make it 3 - 1			0
in 53 minutes the excellent @entity24 ghosted past @entity56 and played a brilliant backheel into the path of @entity42			1
the attacker seemed odds on to hammer a nail in @entity3 ’s coffin until @entity9 stuck out a knee to produce a superb and crucial save			2
five minutes later the onus fell on @entity9 again			0
he got nowhere near the @entity101 penalty , guessing the wrong way			0
but when @entity3 needed it most luck was on their side as the ball rolled past the @entity319 luck was on their side then , it was to be in short supply as the game progressed			2
playing their intricate , neat passing moves @entity26 looked liable to score at will			0
somehow @entity3 held firm until six minutes from time when @entity24 turned @entity64 inside , his penetrating cross picking out @entity42 for a downward header into the corner of the net for 3 - 1			1
it was n’t over yet			0
not for the first time in the match @entity9 kept @entity3 in it – just - by diving to save a second @entity101 penalty after @entity59 tugged the substitute @entity46 back for a soft spot kick award			1
as the board went up for full - time , however , the @entity339 bore the look of a modern day @entity344			1
a swift , clinical @entity26 breakaway saw @entity38 play a perfect ball across the face of an exposed backline for @entity46 to slot expertly into the net for 4 - 1			1
@entity350 : @entity352 1 - 2 @entity351			0

@entity17 sent off for professional challenge minute before half - time
@entity60 opened scoring for @entity20 's team in *eighth* minute
@entity24 equalised just two minutes later before firing hosts in front nine minutes before break
@entity42 doubled advantage six minutes before time
@entity46 struck in injury time to pile on misery
@entity113 champions miss two penalties through @entity45
new signing @entity63 was handed his @entity3 debut
@entity171 *international* joined hoops on six - month loan from @entity376 on monday
