by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 08:10 est , 9 october 2013 the @entity2 is leaning toward withholding most military aid to @entity4 except to promote counterterrorism , security in the @entity7 that borders @entity8 , and other such priorities , a @entity2 official said today			1
the official said @entity2 president @entity11 had not made a final decision on the issue , which has vexed @entity2 officials as they balance a desire to be seen promoting democracy and rights with a desire to keep up some cooperation with @entity4 's military			1
the military on july 3 overthrew president @entity22 , who emerged from @entity4 's @entity24 movement to become the country 's first freely elected president last year after the february 2011 fall of longtime authoritarian ruler @entity27			2
anger : @entity30 university students and members of the @entity24 shout slogans against the military in front of @entity35 in @entity30 protests : @entity30 university students and members of the @entity24 carry a banner with the four - fingered symbol of @entity39 , representing the six - week sit - in in @entity30 that was disbanded by the military on august 14 devastated : @entity4 government employees clean up outside the @entity44 mosque , where supporters of @entity4 's ousted president @entity22 had a protest camp in @entity47 in august @entity22 supporters and security forces have repeatedly clashed since , including on sunday , one of the bloodiest days since the military took power , with state media reporting 57 people dead			0
after @entity22 's ouster , the @entity11 administration said it would suspend about $ 585 million ( 364 million pounds ) in military assistance to @entity4 pending a wider policy review			1
the @entity2 official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the @entity11 administration was now leaning toward continuing to withhold most of that , with the exceptions described above			1
the official said the @entity2 was also leaning toward continuing some economic aid to @entity4 , but chiefly funds that go to nongovernmental groups rather than to the government itself			1
a second @entity2 official , also speaking on condition of anonymity , said a decision on the aid was likely to be made public by the end of the week , although he noted that an announcement has been repeatedly postponed			2
future : the official said @entity2 president @entity11 had not made a final decision on the issue @entity4 for decades has been among the largest recipients of @entity2 military and economic aid because of its 1979 peace treaty with @entity2 ally @entity8 , which agreed to withdraw from the @entity7 it seized from @entity4 in 1967 as a result of the pact			1
the @entity2 has long provided @entity4 with about $ 1.55 billion in annual aid , including $ 1.3 billion in military assistance			1
the removal of @entity22 has left @entity11 with an acute dilemma : whether to get tough with the army for toppling a democratically elected president , albeit an @entity91 who had few friends in @entity94 , or whether to acquiesce in his overthrow			0
@entity2 officials have said there has been a sharp debate within the administration for months over the issue , with one saying that the @entity101 had argued for continuing military aid , while others urged a significant reduction			1
at the @entity105 on september 24 , @entity11 appeared to split the difference , saying the @entity2 would maintain constructive ties with @entity4 's interim government despite its anti-democratic moves - including an emergency law and restrictions on opposition parties , the media and civil society			1
he also suggested that some military aid would depend on the interim government embracing a more inclusive democracy			0
meeting : @entity120 @entity119 ( left ) and @entity4 interim president @entity121 ( right ) review honor guards at @entity123 offices , in @entity124 , @entity120 trip : @entity121 arrived from @entity126 as part of his first overseas tour since he replaced deposed @entity91 president @entity22 in early july ' going forward , the @entity2 will maintain a constructive relationship with the interim government that promotes core interests like the @entity133 and counterterrorism , ' he said , referring to the @entity2 - brokered agreements that led to the @entity4 - @entity8 peace treaty			2
' we 'll continue support in areas like education that directly benefit the @entity4 people , ' he added			1
' but we have not proceeded with the delivery of certain military systems , and our support will depend upon @entity4 's progress in pursuing a more democratic path			0
' earlier on tuesday , @entity147 quoted a @entity2 official as saying that an ' accumulation of events , ' including the recent violence , had led to the decision on a ' full suspension ' of aid , a report the @entity156 denied			0
' the reports that we are halting all military assistance to @entity4 are false , ' @entity157 , a spokeswoman for the @entity158 , said in a statement			0
" we will announce the future of our assistance relationship with @entity4 in the coming days , but as the president made clear at ( the @entity105 ) , that assistance relationship will continue			2
" the @entity101 declined all comment			0
ominous : bloodstains are seen on the ground in @entity170 street , in downtown @entity30 following clashes between @entity4 riot police and @entity24 supporters at the weekend			0
it is unclear who the flip flops belonged to and whether they lived or died bloody : the attack comes after dozens died last weekend in clashes involving security forces , supporters of @entity22 's @entity24 and their opponents hospital : in a separate incident , an explosion near a state security building in @entity188 killed two people and injured 48 , medical sources said			0
a witness said the explosion was caused by a car bomb @entity193 , a spokeswoman for the @entity2 @entity194 , which oversees foreign military aid and sales , earlier told @entity197 there had been no change in policy or status regarding @entity4			2
officials at @entity203 , which makes @entity205 tank kits for @entity4 , and @entity206 , which is building @entity208 helicopters for the @entity210 country , said late on tuesday they had not been notified of any decision to halt military aid			2
there was no immediate comment from @entity215 , which is building @entity217 fighter jets for @entity4			0
shipments of four f - 16s have already been halted temporarily , and eight more jets were due to be delivered in december			0
two former government officials familiar with foreign military sales have said the @entity11 administration is likely to curtail certain high - visibility weapons sales such as the 12 @entity215 f - 16s due to be delivered to @entity4 this year to send a message to the military			1
the planes could be fairly easily adapted for sale to other countries , they said .			0

@entity233 said president @entity11 had not made a final decision on the issue
trying to strike balance between democracy and cooperation with military
@entity11 administration said it would suspend about $ 585 million after ouster
@entity2 to continue support ' in areas like education '
some economic aid to @entity4 could be given to nongovernmental groups
