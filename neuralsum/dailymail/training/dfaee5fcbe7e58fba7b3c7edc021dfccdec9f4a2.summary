by @entity0 published : 21:02 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 23 march 2013 dr @entity1 molested two junior colleagues at a hospital in @entity4 a senior hospital doctor who groped a trainee surgeon telling her : ' well that ’s what juniors are for is n’t it ? ' was struck off the medical register in disgrace			1
dr @entity1 , 40 , had been conducting a private anatomy lesson when he forced himself upon the woman and attempted to kiss her whilst trying to put his right arm down the inside of her blouse			1
when the junior colleague protested and told him to get off , @entity1 replied : ' i have to practice for my wife ' and later added : ‘ ' at the end of your rotation you will be begging for it , ’ ' it was said			1
later after she moved hospitals @entity1 sent the junior surgeon a text saying : ' a good boss is like a bra - always supportive and never lets you down , a bad boss is like pampers - always stuck to your arse			1
’ ' the woman known as dr @entity39 was one of two junior female colleagues molested by @entity1 at the @entity42 in @entity4 where he was registrar			1
the other woman known as @entity44 was said to have been ' confused and distressed ' by @entity1 groping her breast and fielded an entry in her diary saying : ' awful day			1
' at the @entity48 in @entity49 of @entity50 , @entity4 denied wrongdoing but was found guilty of misconduct charges by a fitness to practise panel			1
chairman dr @entity55 told him : ' whilst the extent of the physical assault was limited , it occurred on each occasion , during a teaching situation with a junior colleague that you both engineered and exploited			1
' it was a serious breach of trust , the victim on each occasion being new to the department and considerably junior to you			1
' @entity72 took full account of your potential talent as a surgeon and it also considered the question of potentially depriving the public of a valuable doctor			1
' however in the light of the serious nature and extent of these transgressions , your conduct is fundamentally incompatible with continued medical registration			2
' the incident involving dr @entity39 occurred in december 2009 in an empty coffee room after she was invited dr @entity1 for ‘ ’ further teaching			1
' mr @entity93 counsel for the @entity48 said : ' he asked dr b about anatomy and when she answered correctly he put his arms around her as if to give her an encouraging hug			2
it was a small room nobody else was present			2
' totally inappropriate ' : the @entity48 was told at a hearing in @entity100 that @entity1 had ' manipulated ' his alleged victims by offering to teach them ' he took it upon himself to suddenly and tightly embrace her , forcing his mouth onto hers forcing his tongue into her mouth			1
while doing that attempting to put his right arm down the inside of her blouse			2
' following that incident her reaction was to object and repute him for what had happened but he started to say totally inappropriate things such as “ i have to practice for my wife ” and " well that ’s what juniors are for is n’t it			1
" ' he also invited her to attend a course with him in @entity124			2
when she made it clear his advances were not welcome he said ‘ ’ at the end of your rotation you will be begging for it '			2
' at the end of the shift , she had had an induction meeting and when he saw her emerging from the meeting , he was clearly concerned as to whether she had made any complaints about him , she had n’t at that early stage			2
' dr @entity39 moved on from her surgical training and transferred to another hospital in the @entity141 where she had a much happier experience but in may 2010 she suddenly received the offensive text from @entity1 on her mobile			1
dr @entity39 is said to be still suffering from shock			2
the second victim known as @entity44 was a nurse practitioner who had just started training at the same hospital			1
@entity1 was said to have lured her to a lecture theatre in november 2009 under the pre-text of ' demonstrating relevant anatomy ’ ’ only to cup her breast in his hand			1
@entity44 told the hearing : ' he was drawing pictures of lungs and different incisions , he touched me on the back first , below my right shoulder blade and moved his hand right around towards the front			2
' he moved his hand from the back to the front , my right breast			2
i was just a bit shocked			0
i do n’t know , he could have drawn it on the diagram			0
i just moved away and i sat back			0
' i just felt very uncomfortable because he touched me			0
he carried on with the drawings and continued talking about the lungs			0
' my heart was racing			0
i felt like a lump of jelly			0
i knew i had gone bright red , blushing and he asked me if i had allergies			0
i knew my face was bright red , he touched my left cheek and i said ‘ no ’			0
he was sitting next to me , i did n’t get up , he just continued teaching			0
i had concerns but i did n’t know how to get out of the situation			0
i did n’t know what to say to be able to get away			0
' ' i thought when he touched my face , momentarily i thought ‘ is he going to kiss me ? ' i said i needed to go and pick my kids up i thought that was a good excuse because i do n’t have any children			0
the whole time i was trying to think of something i could say to get away			0
i could n’t organise myself to think of something to say			0
' ' i had just started working there and i did n’t want to cause any trouble i just wanted to get on with my him			0
i did n’t have any more teaching and i only saw him on the ward rounds , he made me a bit more nervous			0
' @entity1 was reported after @entity44 attended an interview with a consultant the following february and confessed her spell at the hospital had been ' unhappy ' because of her experience with @entity1			1
in a subsequent trust disciplinary proceedings relating to both women , @entity1 claimed dr @entity39 had made ' profoundly racist ' comments towards him			1
he claimed he had only taken her to the coffee room to tackle her over a complaint made about her work			0
his allegations are firmly denied by @entity213			0
