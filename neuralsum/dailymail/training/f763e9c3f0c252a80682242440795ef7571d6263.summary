by @entity0 with its magnetic fields swarming , solar flares erupting , and gigantic columns of material constantly on the move , researchers have always known the sun has a large and extremely active atmosphere			0
now researchers have revealed in fact it stretches for five million miles - far further than previously thought			0
@entity13 says the results are so stunning they may even have to alter future missions because of the huge protective bubble			2
@entity13 's @entity30 will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun in 2018			1
the mission will directly measure the density , velocity and magnetic field of the solar material there			2
@entity13 hopes it will allow scientists to understand how motion and heat in the corona and solar wind are generated			2
with direct access to the sun 's atmosphere , @entity30 will provide unprecedented information on how the solar corona is heated and revolutionize our knowledge of the origin and evolution of the solar wind			1
using @entity13 's @entity26 , scientists have found that this atmosphere , called the corona , is even larger than thought , extending out some 5 million miles above the sun 's surface - the equivalent of 12 solar radii			1
this information has implications for @entity13 's upcoming @entity30 mission , due to launch in 2018 and go closer to the sun than any man - made technology ever has before			1
the observations provide the first direct measurements of the inner boundary of the heliosphere -- the giant bubble sparsely filled with solar particles that surrounds the sun and all the planets			1
' combined with measurements from @entity76 of the outer boundary of the heliosphere , we have now defined the extent of this entire local bubble , ' researchers say			2
scientists used these observations of the sun 's atmosphere ( the bright light of the sun itself is blocked by the black circle at the middle ) from @entity13 's @entity26 on aug. 5 , 2007 , to define the outer limits of the solar atmosphere , the corona			1
' we 've tracked sound - like waves through the outer corona and used these to map the atmosphere , ' said @entity95 of the @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98			0
the results were published in @entity100 on may 12 , 2014			0
the researchers studied waves known as magnetosonic waves , and they are a hybrid of sound waves and magnetic waves called @entity108 waves			0
unlike sound waves on @entity111 , which oscillate several hundred times per second , these waves oscillate about once every four hours -- and are about 10 times the length of @entity111			0
tracking magnetosonic waves showed @entity115 and his team that the material throughout this extended space remained connected to the solar material much further in			0
that is to say that even out to 5 million miles from the sun , giant solar storms or coronal mass ejections can create ripple effects felt through the corona			0
a solar flare erupting : researchers have now revealed the full extent of the sun 's atmosphere , which stretches for five million miles			2
beyond that boundary , however , solar material streams away in a steady flow called the solar wind -- out there , the material has separated from the star and its movement ca n't affect the corona			0
realizing that the corona extends much further than previously thought has important consequences for @entity13 's @entity30 because the mission will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun. scientists knew the mission would be gathering information closer to the sun than ever before , but could n't be sure it would travel through the corona proper			1
highly processed movies from @entity13 's @entity26 show wave motions moving downward through the solar corona toward the sun.			1
