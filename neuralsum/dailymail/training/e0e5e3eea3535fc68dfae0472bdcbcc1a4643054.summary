by @entity0 £ 20m turnover : food writer @entity2 helped develop a menu for @entity4 , but a nutritionist complained that the menu listed burgers and sausages as ' healthy ' as a children ’s food guru , @entity9 built a multi-million - pound empire telling parents how to cook healthy meals for youngsters			1
and after lucrative contracts with the likes of @entity18 , retail chain @entity4 signed her up to develop a children ’s menu for their restaurants			2
but mrs @entity2 , who was awarded an mbe in 2006 for outstanding work in child nutrition , has been forced to backtrack on claims that her food was ‘ healthy and nutritious ’ – after a leading expert reported her ‘ outrageous ’ claims to a local council			1
@entity31 nutritionist @entity30 was horrified when she saw the dishes , which included burgers , sausages , chips and ice cream , were being promoted on posters and menus as healthy options			1
‘ it is outrageous that food such as burgers , sausages , and sugary snacks are being advertised as healthy , ’ she said			2
‘ parents and children are bombarded with healthy eating messages			0
but they are now being faced with confusing advertisements in their local shopping centre for healthy kids ’ meals			0
’ miss @entity30 contacted trading standards officers in @entity53 , @entity54 , who took up the claims with executives at the store			1
and the chain , which is owned by billionaire sir @entity59 , has now agreed to change the wording on the menus			0
@entity62 , from the food and safety team at @entity53 council , said : ‘ we have been told they have had several high - level meetings with @entity9 regarding the wording for the children ’s meal boards in the store and have agreed that the word “ healthy ” will be removed from the menu boards			2
’ in a joint statement , @entity4 and mrs @entity2 said : ‘ new menus will not include the word “ healthy ”			1
instead , they will focus on specific nutritional benefits of each individual product			0
@entity9 's nutritious kids meals for @entity4 ‘ all of the meals sit within @entity83 nutritional guidelines per meal for children aged five to ten			1
’ despite the climbdown , the self - appointed ‘ @entity92 ’s number - one parenting author ’ , whose business has a turnover of more than £ 20milllion , is still claiming the dishes are ‘ nourishing ’ on her company ’s website			0
the site says : ‘ i ’m so excited about the range i have developed for @entity4 restaurants			0
the tasty nourishing meals for kids assures parents that their little ones are being served food that is healthy and nutritious			2
’ miss @entity30 welcomed the store ’s climbdown as a ‘ small victory , ’ but said she would have preferred the menus to have been overhauled – offering food that was ‘ actually healthy ’ .			0

food health expert 's @entity4 menu was shopped to trading standards
a leading nutritionist was shocked at ' healthy ' burgers and sausage claim
new menus have now dropped the word ' healthy '
but mrs @entity2 's website still *labels* meals ' nutritious '
