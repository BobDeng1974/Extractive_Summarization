by @entity0 published : 12:00 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 02:17 est , 26 november 2013 @entity1 might not be the first place that springs to mind when the words ' exotic ' , ' animals ' and ' safari ' are mentioned			0
but a new exhibition showcasing robots inspired by nature will let visitors interact with an electronic cheetah cub , a mechanical flying bat and a shoal of biomimetic fish in the capital			1
the @entity16 ’s three - day festival celebrates 13 incredible robots from across @entity18 , many of which have gone on display for the first time			1
its wings change shape during flight to efficiently manoeuvre			0
it was created by the @entity30 and robotics of the @entity32 , @entity33 and will go on show for the first time in the @entity36 visitors to the exhibition , which opens on november 27 and runs for a long weekend until december 1 , can trek through the unnatural habitats of robots inspired by nature , interacting with creatures that swim , flap , and crawl , in a ‘ unique ’ safari experience			1
the exhibition includes an underwater turtle robot , a robotic cheetah - cub , a shoal of luminous robotic fish and the unveiling of @entity50 , a mechanical salamander			1
@entity51 will demonstrate their robots from helping visitors interact with the fish to stretching the bat 's wings , while explaining the latest developments in biomimetic robotics			1
@entity59 is a luminous robotic fish			0
in a shoal it shows how robots can work together and may be useful for studying the behaviour of real fish			2
@entity59 , which was created by @entity67 , @entity68 , will go on show for the first time in the @entity36 @entity70 replicates salamander movements recorded from x-ray films and will aid reserach into motor skills , while @entity75 is an amphibious robot that can both swim in water and walk on land			1
the robot was created to better understand how neural circuits inside a salamander ’s spinal cord enable movement there are also lessons to help people programme , build and race their own simple robots			1
@entity87 , content developer for @entity89 at the museum , said : ‘ visitors to @entity89 will see not just how nature can inspire innovative robotic designs , but also how these biomimetic robots are actually advancing our understanding of the animals and plants they mimic			1
’ the cheetah robot , may not look that much like its furry inspiration , but it mimics the cat ’s legs so it can walk and trot			2
cheetah - cub - @entity105 ( @entity105 ) , @entity104 cheetah - cub is the fastest sub- 30kg quadruped robot in the world , reaching 1.42m/s			2
lightweight , compact and self - stabilising , the robot mimics a cat 's legs and is currently being used to investigate the mechanics of cat locomotion lightweight and self - stabilising , the next - generation cat is not just a novelty item , but is a research tool that has the potential to be used by scientists to explore rough terrains			0
the robot , which is built by the robotics laboratory at @entity105 , @entity104 , the cub is the fastest four - legged robot that weighs under 30kg , in the world and can run at 1.42 metres per second			1
the researchers are also debuting their robotic salamander – the @entity50 – for the first time			0
@entity128 , @entity30 for @entity129 , @entity130 , has created ' arrows ' - an archaeology robot designed to dive to dangerous depths			0
the robotic turtle can operate independently , inspecting wrecks for hours before resurfacing , and has not been shown in the @entity36 before professor @entity137 of @entity105 , said : ‘ cheetah - cub mimics much of cat morphology – featuring significant simplifications and better performance than traditional quadruped robots – while the salamander - like @entity50 represents the next stage in our quest to understand how the nervous system controls rich movement			1
‘ we aim to use @entity50 for paleontology and robotics research , as we attempt to bring early tetrapods to life			0
’ the @entity24 uses extremely light artificial muscles to move and its wings change shape during flight , while @entity157 moves like the real thing and can negotiate obstacles as well as react to sound			0
@entity160 is a dodecahedral 12 - legged robot , which mimics the way tumbleweed moves when blown by the wind			0
it was created by the @entity166 of @entity167 , @entity168 an usual 12 - legged robot mimics the unusual movement of a tumbleweed and another copies jellyfish propulsion to help scientists understand how the creatures move			2
there are also multiple underwater robotic animals on show , including sea turtles , an @entity180 and @entity59 - a luminous robotic fish that can swim as part of a shoal to show how robots can work together			1
@entity89 is free and suitable for all ages , but the @entity16 expects it to be popular and timed tickets will be needed , that can be booked in person at its ticket office or via 020 7942 4000			2
@entity180 is extremely simple , light and noiseless , using artificial muscles to move			0
this enables the robot to monitor underwater environments without disturbing local fish			0
it was developed by the @entity30 and robotics of the @entity32 , @entity33			0

the @entity16 ’s three - day festival celebrates 13 incredible animal robots from across @entity18 to showcase developments in biomimetics
a @entity203 that can run at 1.42 metres per second , a flying bat and an amphibious salamander are just some of the creations to go on show
visitors can trek through the unnatural habitats of robots inspired by nature , interacting with creatures that swim , flap , and crawl
after interacting with the robots , which have been *painstakingly* built by professionals , visitors can have a go at building their own simple *versions*
