@entity1 senator @entity0 says she 's relieved @entity2 has been found guilty of carrying out the @entity4 bombing - the greatest tragedy in her state 's recent history - but does n't believe he should be executed			1
in an interview with @entity11 on thursday , @entity9 reacted to wednesday 's jury verdict which found the 21 - year - old guilty on all 30 charges related to the @entity15 explosions which killed three and injured hundreds at the finish line			1
' nothing is ever going to make those who were injured whole and it 's been a terrible thing but this is a step toward justice , ' @entity9 said			2
when asked what she would like to see happen in the penalty stage of the trial , liberal - minded @entity9 stuck by her anti-death penalty stance			1
' my heart goes out to the families here but i do n't support the death penalty			0
i think that he should spend his life in jail - no possibility of parole - he should die in prison			0
but that 's just how i see it			0
it 's up to the jury , ' she said			0

@entity2 pictured right in @entity4 federal court on wednesday as his guilty verdict was read @entity9 went on to speak about current @entity50 party issues , as well as comment and likely presidential candidate @entity52			1
however , the woman once thought to be a front - runner for her party refused to compare her politics to the former secretary of state			1
@entity9 has repeatedly denied that she will run in the @entity50 primaries			0
now that @entity2 has been found guilty of committing the @entity15 bombings , the case will move on to the penalty stage of the trail which could begin as early as monday			1
it is in this stage of the trial that the jury will decide whether or not to sentence @entity2 to life in prison or the death penalty - a matter in which they will have to vote unanimously			1

one thing @entity2 's favor is his lead defense attorney @entity88 , who specializes in death penalty cases and spared notorious killers like @entity91 @entity91 from execution			2
@entity94 's method is to humanize her client to the jury , with stories about their life which might explain what led them to commit such heinous crimes			0
in the first portion of the trial , the defense alluded to an argument that then 19 - year - old @entity2 was influenced by his radicalized older brother @entity104			0
attorneys will likely continue that storyline with this next phase of the trial , exploring the brothers relationship , their childhood in @entity111 and @entity112 and their later immigration to the @entity114 with their parents			0
however , legal experts say saving @entity2 from the death penalty will be her toughest job yet			0
secret weapon : @entity2 's lead defense attorney , @entity88 , specializes in death penalty cases and has spared several of her notorious killer clients from execution by humanizing them to the jury			1
pictured above leaving court on wednesday , after hearing the guilty verdict for @entity2 ' i have n't yet heard all the mitigating factors you 'd expect to hear			2
in traditional death penalty cases , it 's physical abuse , sexual abuse , drug abuse , dropping out of school , ' @entity132 , a death penalty expert at @entity134 , said			0
however , @entity2 has yet another advantage of being put on trial in @entity1 since the state outlawed capital punishment in 1984			1
while the death penalty is not allowed in state cases , @entity2 is being tried in federal court which makes the death penalty a possible sentencing option			2
however , experts say that since the jury was pulled from a pool of @entity1 residents , they could decided against the death penalty as a reflection of the state 's general politics on the issue			1
the prosecution will also have to convince the jury while @entity2 should be sentenced to death , proving that the crime was carried out with certain aggravating factors that warrant execution			2
so far they 've listed such factors as killing a child and planning the attack for the day of the @entity15 to maximize the loss of life .			0

@entity2 , 21 , was found guilty wednesday on all 30 charges related to the 2013 @entity15 bombing
his case will now proceed to the penalty stage , in which the jury will decide whether to sentence him to life in prison or execution
reflecting her state 's liberal politics , @entity9 is against capital punishment
@entity9 also spoke about current party issues - but refused to compare her politics to those of likely presidential candidate @entity52
@entity9 has repeatedly said she will not be running for president in 2016
