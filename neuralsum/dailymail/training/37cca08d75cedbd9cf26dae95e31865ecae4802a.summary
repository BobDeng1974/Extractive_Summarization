sixty conservative mps , including dr @entity1 , are today backing a campaign to persuade @entity3 to clear the way for a new generation of grammar schools			1
sixty conservative mps are today backing a campaign to persuade @entity3 to clear the way for a new generation of grammar schools			1
former defence secretary @entity1 , the chairman of the influential 1922 committee , @entity12 , and former leadership contender @entity13 are among those calling for an end to the ban on new selective state schools			1
the grassroots @entity19 group , @entity18 , is building support among @entity7 for a change in policy which it says would be a vote - winner among millions of middle - class parents			1
at present , the law forbids new grammar schools , whose intake is based on academic ability -- only allowing existing institutions to open ‘ satellites ’ in new locations			1
@entity35 , the home secretary , and @entity37 , the defence secretary , have broken ranks to back plans for new satellite grammar school campuses in their constituencies			2
the option is being attempted by conservative councillors in @entity44 , where @entity47 of @entity44 girls ’ grammar school in @entity46 has applied to open a site nine miles away in @entity50			2
mr @entity3 has long resisted calls to pledge to expand selective schooling in the @entity19 manifesto			1
the architects of the coalition ’s school reforms hoped that controversy over grammar schools in the party could be put to rest by focusing specialist academies and free schools			0
but dr @entity1 said : ‘ diversity in the provision of education has been a central theme of this government ’s policy and should be extended wherever possible			1
’ mr @entity13 , the former shadow home secretary , said : ‘ grammar schools were probably one of the most transformative public policies of the middle of the 20 century			0
they took a very large population of working class kids and gave them opportunities that they would never have got any other way			0
’ mr @entity12 said : ‘ as most local authorities got rid of their grammar schools , we have seen social mobility take a nosedive and a less cohesive society			0
‘ we have seen far fewer people from state educated backgrounds in law , the upper reach of the civil service , the judiciary and indeed in politics and we must return to the sense that anybody can get on according to their ability and their efforts – that is what brought me into the @entity98			1
’ a poll last week showed that 54 per cent of voters say that they would support entirely new grammar schools in areas where there was evidence parents wanted them , such as petitions in support			2

file picture @entity113 , founder of @entity18 , the grassroots party pressure group which is behind the new campaign , said 60 mps had so far offered their support			1
‘ we want to ensure that in the @entity98 manifesto there is a clear commitment to reverse the legislation preventing the creation of new grammar schools , ’ he added			0
‘ our followers are strongly of the opinion that new grammar schools will both enhance social mobility and present parents with choice , both of which lie at the heart of the @entity98 ’s values			0
’ @entity133 and @entity134 mp @entity134 , a member of the @entity135 , said : ‘ there ’s no silver bullet to reviving stagnant social mobility in @entity139			0
but grammar schools are a key piece of the policy jigsaw , creating a ladder of opportunity for talented and hard - working youngsters from council estates and rural backwaters			2
’ research for @entity18 found 84 per cent of people said that grammar schools are a valuable asset to the @entity139 education system			0
some 80 per cent believe that grammar schools make the education system fairer			0
two thirds of parents say they would enter their child for an 11 + exam and send them to a grammar school if they passed			0
in the 1970s , @entity163 - herself a grammar school girl - allowed local councils to decide themselves whether their schools should remain selective grammars when she was the education secretary			1
it proved to be a political misjudgement , since many councils took the opportunity to end selective state education			2
there are now around 160 grammar schools left in @entity173 , mostly in the home counties .			0
