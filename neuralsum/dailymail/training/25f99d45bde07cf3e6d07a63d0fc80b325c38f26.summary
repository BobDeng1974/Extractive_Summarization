@entity0 examined @entity0 accounts of people in relationships from around the world in a bid to understand relationship trends			0
they found that internationally the average age gap between heterosexual partners is 2.4 years			1
@entity0 collected information from @entity0 accounts around the world to get a sense of the average age gaps in relationships @entity0 figures : the age gap between partners in female - male , female - female and male - male relationships the age difference between partners is significantly higher in same - sex relationships and highest among homosexual male couples , where the average age difference peaked at more than nine years			1
in 67 per cent of heterosexual relationships the man is older than the woman , in 20 per cent of relationships the woman is older than the man , and in the remaining 13 per cent the couple is the same age ( when the person ’s age is rounded to the nearest year )			1
and it seems the older we get , the bigger the age gap			0
older people were more likely to have a partner whose age differed significantly from their own than younger couples			0
age gaps between couples was lowest in @entity43 , where the average difference was 1.82 years			2
and the age gap was highest in @entity46 where the average age difference was 5.09 years			1
most heterosexual couples in the world have a 2.4 year age gap , with the man as the older partner			2
the study found that on average , couples in same - sex relationships have a much larger age gap countries with lower rankings on the @entity58 are shown on the left - hand side of the graph			1
countries with a large age gap between partners are in the top half of the graph @entity0 also compared the age difference among heterosexual couples to the @entity69 ’s ( @entity69 ) @entity68 , which ranks countries based on the gender gaps in economics , politics , education and health			1
on average the countries that had lower scores on the @entity69 ’s index ( those with large gender gaps on social and political issues ) also have large age gaps in relationships however , some @entity86 countries that scored poorly on the @entity68 rating scheme also had smaller age differences in relationships			2
couples in the nations of @entity91 and @entity92 for example , which rank fairly low on the @entity58 , have the same approximate age gap as couples in the gender progressive @entity97 states of @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , and much smaller age differences than couples in the more equitable nations of @entity105 and @entity106			0
@entity0 attribute this to the fact these @entity86 nations are quite affluent and have high educational expectations , so couples are more likely to meet at university , where most people are of similar ages			0
the researchers examined couples whose average age was between 20 and 49			0
the data was collected in october 2013 and released last month as part of @entity0 's @entity120			0
@entity0 figures : the age gap between partners in female - male , female - female and male - male relationships the older we get the bigger the age gap : young people are more likely to pair up with people closer to their age than older people are			2

@entity0 analysed the relationship data from its *users* around the world
the data shows that in 67 per cent of heterosexual relationships the man is older than the woman , and the average age difference is 2.4 years
relationship age gaps are significantly bigger in same - sex relationships
@entity43 has the smallest average age gap , @entity46 has highest average gap
countries with poor gender equality have larger average age gaps
