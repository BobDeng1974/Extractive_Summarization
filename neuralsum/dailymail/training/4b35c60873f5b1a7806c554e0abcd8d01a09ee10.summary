beacon of hope : pope @entity3 is setting up an expert committee to investigate how to tackle sex abuse within the @entity18 @entity2 was the epicentre of the 2002 clerical sexual abuse scandal in the @entity25 and poignantly it was its archbishop , cardinal @entity27 , who announced the creation of the commission			1
the commission will be made up of international lay and religious experts on sex abuse , and is set to study current programs to protect children , better screen priests and to train church personnel , @entity30 said			1
the findings will be used to suggest new initiatives for both the @entity40 to implement inside the @entity41 and for bishops to implement around the world , he added			0
to date , the @entity40 ’s involvement in the sex abuse crisis has been largely judicial in nature , with the @entity47 in 2001 taking over church trials for priests accused of raping and molesting children			1
new ground : the commission , announced by @entity2 's archbisop cardinal @entity30 , will be made up of international lay and religious experts on sex abuse , and is set to look at how to protect children from paedophiles , how to better screen men for the priesthood and how to help victims bringing change : @entity3 , seen among an adoring crowd on wednesday 's @entity60 in the @entity40 , has been praised around the world for modernising the attitude of the @entity18 however , @entity30 said he did not know whether one of the issue of how to hold bishops who shelter abusive priests accountable would be studied by the commission			1
advocates for victims of clerical abuse have long denounced the @entity40 ’s refusal to sanction bishops who shielded abusive priests and moved them from parish to parish rather than report them to police			0
