@entity0 , the alleged mistress of @entity2 owner @entity1 , who he showered with expensive gifts , has been ordered to pay his wife $ 2.6million			1
@entity7 judge @entity6 awarded @entity8 most of the nearly $ 3million she had sought			2
lawyers for @entity1 had claimed that money used to buy @entity12 a house , luxury cars and stocks was her community property the couple had acquired over six decades of marriage			1
@entity12 's lawyer had argued that the gifts were made when @entity1 and @entity8 were separated and that @entity8 could n't seek them from a third party			1
@entity8 's lawyers used other recordings to show he bought stiviano a house , a @entity36 and other things			2
in the recordings on @entity12 's @entity40 , she and the 80 - year - old billionaire are heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife			1
' the truth is that everything that i have , you 've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you , ' @entity12 said in snippet played in court			0
during the course of their 2 1/2 years together , @entity1 gave her a @entity36 , a @entity52 and a @entity53 , and paid the lion 's share of a $ 1.8 million duplex			2
@entity1 testified that he paid for the entire house , though @entity12 said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer			1
during the course of their 2 1/2 years together , @entity1 had given @entity12 a @entity36 , a @entity52 and a @entity53 , and paid the lion 's share of a $ 1.8 million duplex @entity1 said @entity12 had n't contributed ' 50 cents ' to the house and , noting that @entity12 is part black and @entity67 , said she illegally got her name inserted into escrow documents by befriending @entity67 bank and escrow employees			1
@entity8 filed the suit against @entity12 about a month before the recording of @entity1 telling @entity12 not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the @entity29 to ban him for life and fine him $ 2.5 million			1
in closing arguments , late last month , @entity8 's lawyer had relied on the words of miss @entity12 to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy			1
testimony in @entity82 was n't as clear - cut even after @entity1 's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks @entity1 drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of @entity12 's $ 1.8 million @entity89 - style duplex near @entity90			1
while an accountant for @entity93 conservatively estimated that @entity12 got more than $ 3.6 million in @entity93 gifts that included a @entity36 and @entity96 shopping spree , @entity91 said he would only seek return of the house and more than $ 1 million in cash , saying the lower figure lined up with @entity12 's own admissions on the witness stand , depositions and court filings			1
@entity12 , 32 , pictured arriving at @entity7 superior court last month , painted two conflicting portraits of @entity1 , saying he was a kind , generous mentor and father figure to her but also a ' bigot ' who was mean to others judge @entity113 had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the @entity1 family 's real estate company to @entity12 's bank accounts			1
defense lawyer @entity120 reiterated that point in his closing argument			0
he attacked the credibility of witnesses , particularly @entity1 , who had suggested @entity12 got her name on the home title illegally			2
it was @entity12 who recorded the now - infamous conversation with @entity1 in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to @entity2 basketball games			1
in the furor sparked when the remarks were made public , the @entity29 banned @entity1 from the league for life , and he was ultimately forced to sell the @entity2 franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $ 2 billion			1
@entity120 spent most of his argument trying to convince the judge that the law does n't allow @entity8 to go after a third party like @entity12 because of a breach of fiduciary duty by her husband			2
' say he gave $ 2,000 to a call girl , ' @entity120 said			0
' mrs. @entity8 ca n't go and try to get that money back			0
we know that 's not how it works			0
' in her testimony , @entity12 testified that the 80 - year - old billionaire real estate mogul spent far more time with her and members of her family during the two and a half years she spent as his personal assistant , driver and confidante than he did with his own wife and children			0
' we were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual			0
he became my everything and i became his all , ' she said , though she repeated under oath that the relationship was never sexual in nature			0
@entity8 , who accused @entity12 of fraud when she testified , painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and was now out to hurt him			1
wife speaks : @entity8 , estranged wife of former @entity2 basketball team owner @entity1 , and her attorney @entity91 arrive at @entity82 last month			1
mrs @entity8 painted @entity12 as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts @entity12 , seen here outside the court during last month 's trial , testified that tolerating @entity93 's racist moments was ' part of the job ' platonic relationship : the 32 - year - old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the @entity2 owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature @entity12 never not disputed @entity1 's largesse , though she quibbled with the sums at stake and emphatically denied that she used sex to manipulate him			1
she repeatedly testified that @entity1 tried to manipulate her			0
the apparent contradictions finally led @entity8 's lawyer , @entity91 , to confront @entity12 with the question : ' who is the real @entity1 ? ' ' the real @entity1 is a con artist , a bigot ... he 's mean , he 's despicable , ' @entity12 replied , before quickly adding that to her , he was ' kind , loving , sweet ... a mentor , a father			1
... he treated me as he treated no one else			0
' she added that tolerating his racist moments was ' part of the job ' that had its rewards in the way he treated her and her family			0
@entity12 broke down in tears as she described the @entity2 owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boys			2
in her testimony , miss @entity12 claimed that she was not the only recipient of cash gifts from her octogenarian benefactor , and she named a male friend of @entity1 's who accompanied them on trips to @entity229 , @entity96 and @entity230			2
@entity8 said outside court that the assertion was crazy , and she described the man as a longtime family friend who despises @entity12			2
the judge allowed the testimony as @entity12 's lawyer tried to show where large , unexplained checks may have gone from @entity1 's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $ 1.8million duplex , luxury cars , jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman @entity8 asserts was his mistress			1
@entity12 said she saw cashier 's checks given to the man for $ 800,000 for a ' so - called business deal ' involving a property in @entity7 and a check for $ 75,000 to reimburse him for the @entity229 travel			2
@entity12 could n't say if any of that money ended up in accounts identified as sources for the home purchase			0
she has denied that those were her bank accounts , and @entity1 's lawyers could n't make that connection			0
the 32 - year - old witness said she had worked for @entity1 's charity and spent about 12 hours a day with him over more than two years , driving him to view real estate or attending @entity2 meetings and games together			2
she said he provided money , but it was not regular income â€” and that became a problem in late 2013 when she wanted a job			0
' as long as you 're with me side by side , i will take care of everything you need , ' she said he assured her			0
but @entity12 became suspicious when he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement			0
she said she was offended and refused twice to sign any such paperwork			0
' i know how he works his trickery , ' she said			0
' i knew something was n't right			0

@entity8 has been awarded most of the nearly $ 3 million she had sought to be returned
her lawyers *successfully* argued that money used to buy @entity12 a house , luxury cars and stocks was her community property
@entity12 's lawyer had argued the gifts were made when @entity1 and @entity8 were separated
ruling comes nearly a year after @entity12 's recording of @entity1 making racially offensive remarks that cost him ownership of the @entity2
@entity8 had filed the suit about a month before the recording of @entity1 telling @entity12 not to associate with black people created an uproar
