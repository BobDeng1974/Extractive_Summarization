sales of ear plugs may well rocket as a result of one poor @entity5 ’s ordeal with a cockroach			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , revealed that he was recently forced to seek help from a doctor after a cockroach burrowed into his right ear while he was asleep – and refused to come out			1
it even defied mr @entity7 ’s vacuum cleaner			2
disturbing : the cockroach burrowed into mr @entity7 's ear while he slept ( file picture ) the situation sucked : the cockroach even resisted mr @entity7 's vacuum cleaner ( file picture ) mr @entity7 was alerted to the presence of the unwanted tenant by a sharp pain in his ear , which woke him up			1
he told the @entity26 that his initial worry was that a poisonous spider – of which there are many down under – had burrowed its way into his ear canal			0
the pain rapidly got worse so mr @entity7 tried to suck out the critter with a vacuum cleaner			1
when that failed to work his flatmate decided that it would be best to seek medical help			0
the doctor ’s initial strategy , thinking the insect was small , was to put olive oil down the ear , but that only made matters worse			0
the cockroach simply burrowed further in			0
mr @entity7 said : ‘ near the 10 minute mark ... somewhere about there , he started to stop burrowing but he was still in the throes of death twitching			2
’ the doctor eventually pulled the cockroach out with forceps and its size astonished them both - it was an inch long			2
mr @entity7 told @entity26 : ‘ she ( the doctor ) said , “ you know how i said a little cockroach , that may have been an underestimate			1
” ‘ they said they had never pulled an insect this large out of someone 's ear			0
’ while mr @entity7 has n’t changed his nightime routine , his friends have apparently taken to wearing headphones in bed .			0

mr @entity7 from @entity8 , @entity5 , woke up with pain in his right ear
he realised something was in there and *unsuccessfully* tried to vacuum it out
the pain *escalated* and so mr @entity7 *rushed* to seek medical attention
a doctor pulled out an inch - long cockroach once it had died
