having gone all the way to last year ’s @entity2 final @entity3 has shown she knows how to handle etiquette , including the anachronistic task of having to curtsey			1
yet something as straightforward as a sporting handshake at a low - key draw ceremony , before representing @entity9 in a @entity11 match at the weekend , seems to be beyond her			2
her refusal to shake hands with @entity17 opponent @entity16 turned out to be the precursor of a dreadful few days for the world no 7			1
it beings to symbolise a season fast unravelling for last year ’s shooting star of the women ’s game			2
@entity3 was mocked at home and abroad over the handshake controversy @entity3 refused to shake the hand of @entity16 before @entity11 match at the weekend @entity3 ended up suffering not just the humiliation of losing to far lesser ranked opponents in front of her hometown crowd in @entity35 , but of being mocked by the opposing @entity17 team after they had inflicted defeat			1
moreover , having previously been able to do little wrong in the eyes of her compatriots , she brought upon herself the scorn of fair - minded @entity9 in the media , social and otherwise			0
even @entity17 ’s world number three @entity45 , a shy and retiring type , weighed in by casting aspersions about the kind of upbringing @entity3 has had			1
@entity3 explained away her graceless act as merely being true to herself , but the truth is that such brattish behaviour is neither principled nor smart			1
she would be well - advised to avoid this sort of bravado until she starts winning again			0
it is not the first time that @entity3 has declined the traditional shake of hands that takes place at the draw prior to matches in the @entity11 , the women ’s incomprehensible equivalent of the @entity63			1
she did the same last year to @entity65 ’s @entity64 in front of the cameras which have , again , spread the footage all over the internet			1
the 21 - year - old @entity9 broke into the world 's top 10 after a superb 2014 she lost both her singles matches to world no 69 @entity16 and @entity74 , ranked 104th @entity17 's @entity16 said the handshake snub had given her extra motivation for the match “ it was n’t personal , i just do n’t believe in wishing my opponent good luck before a match , ” said @entity3 this time			1
already bereft of confidence , she set herself up for a fall which duly came , losing both her singles to players ranked 69 and 104			0
after @entity16 beat her in straight sets she celebrated with her team - mates by theatrically pulling away her hand before it could be shaken			1
@entity88 said afterwards the incident had added to her motivation and gleefully declared that it was ‘ nothing personal ’			0
the watching @entity45 told @entity17 reporters : “ i would never have done it but this is how she ( @entity3 ) is raised or it ’s a habit			1
” a superb 2014 saw @entity3 fly into the top ten at a rate few expected , the highlight being her run to the final of @entity100			1
but by the same token this was never likely to be an easy year for the @entity9			2
a sympathetic view would be that the pressure of backing up two @entity108 semis and a final is enormous , and that it is clearly starting tell			0
@entity3 reached last year ’s @entity2 final , where she lost to @entity111 there is also a sneaking admiration for the way she refuses to get involved in the sometimes phoney mateyness that permeates the men ’s locker room			1
not for @entity3 the guff that she is ‘ pleased ’ for her opponents when they do well			1
she happily declares with a smile that is half - angelic , half - steely that she is not interested in being friends with her rivals			0
that is just one reason she is often compared to @entity126			0
at times she appears to take the @entity128 ice queen as her ultimate role model but whether she can ever be technically as good as her is much more open to question			0
after making a decent start to this year by reaching the quarter finals of the @entity132 has now lost six matches out of eight and five straight			2
while going down to @entity136 qualifier @entity134 at @entity137 from 4 - 1 she was in tears			0
she also struggled to control her emotions later in march at @entity140 , when losing to world number 113 @entity144 , whose main claim to fame is that she is the highest ranked mother on the tour			0
@entity3 has enjoyed success off the court with her model looks @entity3 has often been compared to @entity128 ice queen @entity126 @entity3 made a couple of big decisions in december that may have added to the pressure			2
she curiously failed to renew her agreement with respected veteran @entity154 coach @entity153 that had worked so well , with one source suggesting he became aggrieved by her side ’s high handed negotiating stance			0
she is now with @entity159 , former coach of @entity126 ’s fellow shrieker and ex world number one @entity161			0
after eight years @entity3 also switched management companies to @entity164 / @entity163 , which has offered her the chance to work with the @entity167 division and take commercial advantage of the looks she is so blessed with			2
@entity3 also has a strong work ethic , and has shown herself to be ruthless , intelligent and articulate ( more shades of @entity126 )			2
her emergence has undoubtedly boosted the women ’s game and at 21 everyone makes mistakes			0
after this weekend a period concentrating on avoiding them , and focussing on repairs to her tennis game would seem a wise move .			0
