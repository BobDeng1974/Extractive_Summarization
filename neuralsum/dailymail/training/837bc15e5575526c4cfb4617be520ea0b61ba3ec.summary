@entity0 could make difficult decisions less of a headache			0
some of the brain areas involved in physical pain are also involved in mental discomfort , researchers say			1
taking pills designed to suppress physical pain could therefore also be used to reduce the anguish of situations that cause us psychological pain , such as spending money or selling possessions			1
@entity0 could help to ease our anxieties and suppress our psychological pain , according to a new @entity19 study the @entity19 researchers gave volunteers either two paracetamol or two placebo pills			1
half an hour later – after the paracetamol would have had time to act – they were asked to choose between two puzzles that they would like to do			2
normally , after choosing between two equally attractive things , we rationalise the decision by pretending we never really liked the one we rejected			0
this , say the researchers , makes the choice feel less painful			0
but when the volunteers were asked to rate the puzzles a second time , those given the paracetamol rated the rejected puzzle less harshly than the others			0
the @entity41 scientists said this suggests they found the initial decision less painful			1
writing in the @entity44 , the scientists said it showed that the drug could take the pain out of decision - making in a second experiment , the participants were given a mug and were told either that they could keep it or that it belonged to the university			0
they were then told they could sell the mug and asked how much they would charge			0
those who owned the mug were expected to value it more highly – as we tend to find selling our possessions painful			1
but those who took paracetamol set the lowest prices			0
writing in the @entity44 , the scientists said this shows that the drug could take some of the pain out of decision - making			0
‘ when people make decisions , they sometimes use words related to physical pain , ’ they said			1
‘ people might say it “ hurt ” to sell their home , that they were “ crushed ” when they decided to withdraw money from their retirement investment portfolio earlier than they ’d planned ... ‘ we propose that the pain of decision making is not a mere metaphor			2
if so , numbing them to physical pain should also numb them to the psychological pain involved in some sorts of decision making			1
‘ making decisions can be painful but a physical painkiller can take the pain away			2

some parts of brain involved in physical pain also *control* mental discomfort
researchers say paracetamol could then be used to reduce *patient* *'s* anguish
comes after a study into the drugs in the @entity19 by the @entity41
suggest they could reduce pain in situations such as spending too much money or selling possessions
