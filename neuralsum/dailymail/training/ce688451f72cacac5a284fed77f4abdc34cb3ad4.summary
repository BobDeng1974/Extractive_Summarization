they all admit that their faces show signs of the ravages of time			1
but each of these 60 - somethings has a rear view which they say has barely changed since their teenage years			1
so are they kidding themselves ? impossibly vain ? or do they show what the rest of us should be aiming for ? and how much hard work does it take ? here , each of them proudly explains how they have maintained such a youthful rear view			1
@entity18 , 61 , believes in a healthy diet @entity18 , 61 , is a health adviser			1
she lives near @entity21 with her husband @entity22 , 63 , a retired farmer , and their daughter @entity23 , 17 people always say there comes a point when you have to pick between your face and your behind , and that trying to stay slim as you get older will leave you looking scrawny and haggard			1
thankfully , i have never paid any attention to that			2
as far as i ’m concerned , staying attractive as i ’ve got older has meant keeping an eye on my figure			1
yes i may look my age from the front , but i have refused to succumb to middle - aged spread and consequently have a lovely trim behind which would make any woman half my age glow with pride			2
i also make sure i keep my look youthful by refusing to make frumpy wardrobe choices			2
i ’m not about to follow the route of so many women my age and start lengthening my hemline , loosening my waistband or wearing chunky cardigans			1
my legs and bottom have always been my best assets , so wearing something that shows them off makes me feel youthful and sexy			1
i ’ve also learnt a few anti-ageing tricks over the years , like smoothing on fake tan regularly after exfoliating in the shower			1
body lotion can only do so much , but it ’s amazing how a bit of colour can distract the eye from crepey skin			2
sadly , i have to do a little more than exercise to remain this pert and perky at this age			1
as well as going to @entity68 classes several times a week to keep me toned , i stick to a diet of lean meat , fish and greens			1
i only allow myself bread , cakes , chocolate and wine in moderation			2
i last had a glass of red wine a month ago			0
after 20 years of marriage , my husband @entity22 still compliments me , albeit after a slight nudge			0
friends tell me he still boasts about how good i look and that secretly makes me feel very chuffed			1
i ’ve even been mistaken for my 17 - year - old daughter , @entity23 — from behind , i should stress			0
she seems to enjoy having a younger - looking mum whose wardrobe she can raid ! @entity95 , 62 , considered plastic surgery at one point but decided against it @entity95 , 62 , is a retired tv voice - over artist			1
she lives in @entity99 , @entity100 , is divorced and has one daughter , @entity101 , 25 last week , i was in my dentist ’s waiting room when i caught a young man ‘ checking out ’ my bottom as i got up			1
my behind and long legs have always been my best features and i love the fact they ’re still working the same magic they did in my teens — especially when the rest of me is seriously lagging behind			1
it ’s pretty exhausting keeping them in shape , though			1
each morning for the past year , i ’ve woken up and done a short exercise routine called the @entity119 — five ancient yoga - based moves said to have been used by @entity123 monks for over 2,000 years for their energy - giving and anti-ageing benefits			1
you ’re meant to do each move , including back bends and leg lifts , 21 times — no mean feat — to elongate your silhouette			1
i ’m convinced doing this every day has shaved a decade off my behind			0
as time passes , i know looking good is not just about my figure — grooming is everything			1
if i have a bad hair day , i look my age from the back and front			0
so i take care to blow - dry my hair or put it up each day in a way that looks good from all angles , especially the back			1
the downside of looking good from behind is that i worry i do look much older from the front			1
i briefly considered plastic surgery during my 50s when i started to develop jowls			0
i ’d scrutinise celebrities in the newspapers and magazines who ’d had facelifts or nips and tucks and wondered if i should give it a go myself			0
thankfully , the curiosity passed			0
every morning , @entity95 ( pictured ) wakes up and completes a short exercise routine called the @entity119 , an ancient form of yoga i decided instead to focus on my best assets by dressing well , and not being too afraid to wear miniskirts or jeans which add definition to my bum			1
like all clothes , i do n’t believe denim is purely for the young			0
it ’s all down to the fit			0
although i do n’t go on many dates since i divorced in my 50s , most of my male friends tell me i ’m a knockout			0
i ’d like to think they ’ll be saying that for a few more years yet			0
@entity181 , 63 , walks several miles a day and is an avid gardener which helps her keep in shape @entity181 , 63 , manages a chain of rental properties and lives in @entity188			1
she was widowed in 2011 when her husband @entity189 died from cancer			0
she has a son @entity191 , 26 i bumped into an old school friend recently at a party			0
when she introduced me to her husband , he looked at his wife and said : ‘ if you ’re the same age , why do n’t you look like her ? ’ i blushed , partly in embarrassment — thankfully my friend has a good sense of humour — but also partly with pride			1
i was wearing a figure - hugging @entity205 dress , while she was in one of those shapeless smock dresses that so many women my age tend to hide in			1
and he was right — i did look decades younger			2
even i could see it			0
walking several miles a day and doing lots of bending and stretching while gardening seems to have worked for me			0
but i also know how to dress properly			2
sheer tights with a subtle sheen help make my legs look flawless , while seamless underwear ensures i never have unsightly underwear bulges			2
i ’m obsessed with checking my rear view in the mirror before i leave the house and not just to make sure my body looks good — i pay a lot of attention to my hair too			2
i do think dressing well is important in your 60s , and i ’ve learned to adapt the styles i loved when i was younger			1
i wear leggings with knee - high boots and tunic tops , and short dresses — but always with tights			0
bare legs can look tarty at any age but more so when you get older			2
@entity181 ( pictured ) cut out negative people from her life and now feels better about herself and believes it shows i also follow a meticulous skincare regime — i cleanse and moisturise twice a day — and eat everything in moderation , particularly chocolate and alcohol			1
i ’ve made other changes too			0
in the past i ’ve had friends who were hard work and very draining			0
since my husband @entity189 died , i ’ve edited my circle of friends and now choose to surround myself only with people who make me feel happy , ditching the ones who are too critical or negative			0
i feel better about myself and it shows			0
despite this , i know that i look much better from behind than the front , but i am content with that — at least my smile when i turn around is genuine			0
@entity261 , 60 , is a dance teacher which she believes has slowed down the ageing process at bay @entity261 , 60 , is a dance teacher and property developer			1
she has been divorced for 15 years , lives in @entity266 , @entity267 , and has a daughter @entity270 , 27 , and son @entity269 , 24 at a networking event in a smart hotel last week , a man in his 40s asked my daughter and i if we were sisters			2
i hate to sound smug , but that was n’t a huge surprise to me			0
i get complimented fairly regularly and it reminds me of the attention i received in my 20s when i was a dancer with the tv dance troupes @entity282 and @entity284			0
in those days , i ’d often get stopped by men in the street			2
i teach dance classes three times a week and do dozens of squats and lunges , which seem to have kept the ageing process at bay , certainly when it comes to the lower half of my body			1
i ’m always consciously clenching my bottom muscles — when driving the car or washing - up — to keep it as pert as possible and i also do hundreds of sit - ups and crunches every week to keep my tummy and waist taut			2
as a dancer , i know that posture is crucial			0
if you walk tall , with your shoulders back , stomach pulled in and chin up , you will instantly look more shapely and confident			0
in my case , the confidence is n’t faked			0
men love it when a woman holds onto her vibrancy , it can be very sexy and i get chatted up by men half my age			2
many women lose confidence after a divorce but i did n’t			2
i decided to embrace the fun of being back on the dating scene rather than fear it			0
confidence is sexy , says @entity261 ( pictured )			1
she embraced her return to the dating scene			0
i get my highlights refreshed every six weeks so there are n’t any ageing grey roots and i keep my hair long as i think it ’s more youthful that way			0
but the best way to keep young — apart from exercise — is to smile			2
granted , you might not see it from the back , but it changes the way you feel and hold yourself			0

these women put their good looks down to exercise and dressing well
@entity18 , 61 , is a *fan* of using fake tan to look younger
@entity95 , 62 , says men still check out her legs
@entity181 , 63 , loves a good bodycon dress to show off her figure
@entity261 , 60 , dances three times a week to keep in shape
