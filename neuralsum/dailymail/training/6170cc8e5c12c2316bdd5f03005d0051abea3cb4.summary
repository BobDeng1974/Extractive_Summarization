@entity0 has opened the door to a dramatic departure from @entity3 one day by telling @entity6 newspaper @entity4 that he wants to stay at the @entity7 but that players do n’t always get what they want			1
' i live for the here and now and all i ’m thinking about is having a good season and winning the trophies that we want to win at @entity3 , ' he said			2
' after that we will see			0
things change very quickly in football			1
' i have said many times that if it was up to me i would stay here [ at @entity3 ] forever			2
but you do n’t always get everything you want , and even more so in football , where so many different things happen and so much can change			1
it is complicated and even more so with all that things that are happening at @entity3			1
' @entity0 , who has been at @entity3 his entire career has hinted he may not end his career there @entity0 has a contract at the @entity7 until 2018 and a buy - out clause of £ 200million but there is instability at the club with many supporters wanting elections , due in 2016 , to be brought forward to next summer			1
the club has been banned from making signings after breaking rules over the signing of underage players , and @entity0 and his father @entity43 are being taken to court by the @entity45 for unpaid taxes			1
his imminent departure remains out of the question but his latest comments reaffirm the idea that a move to another @entity53 club before he returns to @entity54 to play out the last days of his career at his first club @entity55 is no longer out of the question			2
both @entity57 and @entity58 would want the 27 - year - old , though meeting his clause without destroying their financial fair play credentials would remain an obstacle			0
@entity54 captain @entity0 will hope to show on tuesday that he is still on a level with @entity65 their remain two schools of thought among the power - breakers at the @entity7			1
one group see @entity0 as a sacred institution at the club who should never be sold			1
another more pragmatic group believe @entity75 is the club ’s commercial cash cow going forward , and that if a buyer can be found for @entity0 any offer over £ 120m should be seriously considered			2
@entity0 was also asked about his @entity80 in the interview			0
he said : ' i would like to have played better in the semi-final and final but that is the way tournaments go sometimes			0
' if i had scored that goal in the final everyone would have said what a great tournament i had and how i had played well in every game			0
' i did n’t score it so i get criticised			0
those two games were not my best but neither were they as bad as some have suggested			0
' @entity0 ( left ) captained @entity54 to the @entity80 final this year where they lost 1 - 0 to @entity95 in extra-time			0

@entity0 has spent his entire career at @entity3
but the @entity6 *superstar* can not *guarantee* his future at the club
' things can change a *lot* in football , ' he told @entity6 newspaper @entity4
@entity108 has suggested @entity0 will grow frustrated at rival @entity65 **'s** *magnificent* *goalscoring* rate
