a pair of protesters who came all the way from @entity4 to @entity5 , @entity6 to lodge a protest against their state 's governor , @entity8 , were thrown out of saturday 's @entity11 after they yelled that @entity8 had n't done enough to help victims of @entity13			1
organizers of saturday 's @entity11 warned audience members that they would be escorted out if they caused a scene			0
police quickly tossed the pair , including @entity19 , whose sign claimed ' thousands of families ' were still displaced from their homes			0
@entity23 , a man standing with her , barked , ' i will not shut up ! ' @entity8 had told an activist in october at a @entity28 , @entity4 town hall meeting about post-hurricane rebuilding to do just that			2
' my people follow me everywhere , ' @entity8 quipped to event organizer @entity32 as the protesters were marched to the exit and hundreds applauded			1
' i 'm magnetic , @entity32 , ' he said			2
' they ca n't stay away from me			0
as the pair left the auditorium , @entity8 said that ' it really is a wonderful country that people can do that			2
' @entity19 ' sign read , ' governor @entity8 : thousands of families still not home after @entity13			1
' @entity13 was an historic 2012 storm that ravaged @entity60 's @entity59 coast , killing 12 in @entity4 and causing more than $ 20 billion in damage overall			2
@entity23 said outside that @entity13 's aftermath forced him to abandon his home , and that he and his family have moved three times since then			0
tens of thousands in the @entity4 were made homeless as 80 - mph winds battered the coast and flattened houses , and soe advocates insist the governor has n't done enough to help			2
' i 'm begging you , ' one of the hecklers yelled as she was ejected			0
the two were n't the only ones to disrupt the morning 's program			0
a lone , elderly man interrupted @entity6 gov. @entity81 as the event began , reading aloud from a sheet of paper a litany of complaints about ' corporate ' agriculture			0
he too was shown the door to the sound of cheers and one audience member who yelled ' get him out of here ! ' ' it 's all about money , ' the gray - haired activists had complained			0
' there 's too much corruption			0
' and then : ' we want clean water ! ' a group of about 50 protesters were gathered outside the @entity101 near the @entity102 , a mixture of organic - only food advocates , backers of ' small , family farms , ' opponents of genetically modified food crops , and animal rights activists from @entity110			2
@entity8 , the no - nonsense governor known for boisterous outbursts on the campaign trail , reserved his most emotional words for the @entity117 administration 's fast - evolving policy on @entity118			1
the communist island nation , he complained bitterly , has been harboring since 1984 a fugitive who killed a @entity4 police officer in 1977			1
the ejected @entity8 heckler 's sign identified her as a member of the @entity126 , a liberal group that is demanding more government funds to fix hurricane damage power to the ( @entity130 ) people ! an elderly protester also interrupted @entity6 gov. @entity81 with a litany of complaints about ' corporate ' agriculture @entity135 : activists rallied outside the @entity11 on march 7 as hundreds listened inside to a procession of @entity140 presidential hopefuls ' you can not start trading with a country that is promoting someone who is a cop - killer , ' he said of @entity145 , the 67 - year - old former @entity146 member who escaped from a @entity4 prison in 1979 and has been on the run ever since			1
@entity149 : animal liberation activists from @entity110 were on hand to complain about @entity6 's thousands of pork farmers ' if they 're going to keep harboring fugitives , ' he said , ' i have a problem with that ... the president does n't know how to negotiate			2
you do n't give away the idea of trading with @entity60 for nothing			2
' the @entity118 government refused this week to extradite @entity145 , who has adopted the name @entity145 , as part of trade negotiations designed to give @entity118 access to @entity60 markets after a half - century of political freeze			1
' i can say it is off the table , ' said @entity173 , the deputy director for @entity60 affairs at the @entity118 @entity175 , during a march 2 interview with @entity177			1
in december @entity178 , @entity118 ’s @entity180 affairs , rejected a deal that would have returned @entity145 to the @entity60 in exchange for 5 prisoners held in the @entity60 ' every nation has sovereign and legitimate rights to grant political asylum to people it considers to have been persecuted , ' she told the @entity189 at the time			1
' we ’ve explained to the @entity60 government in the past that there are some people living in @entity118 to whom @entity118 has legitimately granted political asylum			1
' @entity8 also attacked the @entity196 on its economic record , hinting that he favors a wholesale rewrite of @entity60 's tax code			1
fugitive : @entity145 killed a @entity4 police officer , escaped from a @entity4 prison and fled justice in @entity118 , where she still lives under the @entity206 government 's protection ' we tax too much in this country already			1
we tax in a way that 's too complicated , ' he said			0
' we tax that money at every step along the way			0
we tax it when you make it , we tax it when you invest it , and then we tax you when you die – and in some states , like mine , we tax your heirs who take it			0
' ' it 's crazy , ' @entity8 said			0
those taxes , he added , hit @entity60 in concert with an economy that 's growing too slow to be sustainable			0
' this is the worst recovery in modern history [ and ] the president takes a victory lap , ' he carped			1
and touting his own record conducting global trade missions for @entity4 businesses , @entity8 said the president 's approach has been inadequate			1
' i think any of us who have seen the president negotiate over the course of the last 6 years is concerned about the way the president negotiates , ' he said .			0

' my people follow me everywhere ... i 'm magnetic , ' quipped the @entity4 governor
@entity8 kicked off an all - day agriculture *summit* designed to test *potential* presidential *candidates* ' *mettle* on food , farming and energy
he *blasted* the @entity196 for negotiating with @entity118 since a @entity60 fugitive who killed a @entity4 police officer has asylum there
*slammed* @entity117 *personally* for ' anemic ' 2 per cent economic growth as ' worst recovery in modern history [ and ] the president takes a victory lap '
