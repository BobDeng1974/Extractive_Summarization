but you have pleaded guilty and have had the benefit of the payments over several years			2

both were jailed today , @entity0 for more than four years and @entity19 for 20 months ' there were no purchases and no sales and the only business @entity0 was involved in was the manufacturing of false invoices and careful managing of the credits and debits to and from banks accounts to give an air of legitimacy to the fraud and avoid the scrutiny of vat inspectors			1
