@entity0 has admitted that he thought his @entity2 career was over after he reached ' breaking point ' in @entity4 and was forced to quit the last @entity6 tour			1
@entity0 was forced to head home to an uncertain future after his ordeal at the hands of @entity11 in the first @entity12 but has battled back to be on the brink of making his 50th @entity15 appearance against @entity16 on monday			1
' to be brutally honest i did n't know if i 'd be able to come back here and i did n't know if i was going to be selected but i had to get my head down and push my case forward and that 's all i could do			1
i 'm really glad to be here , ' said a relaxed @entity0 before @entity2 headed to @entity22 on friday			1
@entity0 is set to make his 50th @entity12 appearance for @entity2 against the @entity16 on monday ' there 's excitement			1
it 's something i wanted again but i did n't know if things would go my way again and i 'd have this opportunity			1
i 'm very pleased and happy to be here			1
there 's a good bunch of guys here but on a personal note this is just the start of something i want to keep doing and earn my place back			1
' @entity0 looks certain to adopt a new role as opener alongside @entity37 at the start of a series @entity2 can not afford to lose after battling back in county cricket with @entity41 and then as captain of the @entity43			1
' that 's all i 've done so far			1
i went back to @entity41 and earned my place in their side and then went on a @entity43 tour and i think i had to do that for myself and for everyone around me			1
it 's important to have the mentality of coming here and trying to earn a spot in the starting xi. that 's my goal			2
' the guys have been really good			2
the team 's changed a bit so there are guys i have n't played with and a few guys i played on the @entity43 tour with which is great			1
it was nice to go on that tour and see the players coming through there			1
to captain the @entity43 and go away with them was quite an eye opener and i really enjoyed it			2
it 's good to see those guys putting their case forward			2
' @entity0 leaves the field following his dismissal during a warm - up match in @entity76 on thursday @entity0 believes that his @entity4 breakdown was the culmination of problems that were eventually successfully diagnosed as situational anxiety when he began working with renowned sports psychologist @entity81			1
' it was n't so much @entity4 it was more of a lead up to it			2
the whole months leading up to it , even in @entity2 , were really tough and @entity4 was the culmination , a breaking point if you like , and it was interesting to step back and look at the things that have happened since			2
you hope it 's something you will never have to go through but it makes you a stronger person			2
it was a real challenge to be here but the challenge starts now			2
it 's about building relationships again			2
it was @entity100 who said in @entity4 that @entity0 had suffered from a ' stress related ' condition for the bulk of his career			1
is he still suffering ? ' its interesting , you speak to guys i 've played with and they say " i 've probably gone through something similar to you			2
" but it was n't at the sort of level where they were exposed and they were managing to hide it or bury it and got away with it			2
@entity0 plays a shot during @entity2 's game against a @entity121 on monday ' cricket is virtually 12 months a year so if something builds up and is not kept in check it can overtake everything			1
with time and hard work and the right people around me i 've managed to get it right and i 'm back performing			2
i 've had a few obstacles to overcome and get through and i 've been put under pressure quite a bit to get back to this position			2
' i 've been tested on and off the field and had to go through the ringer to get here			0
so , yes i feel really confident i can cope and do really well			0
everything is in place to start performing again and hopefully contribute to getting the @entity2 side back to a successful state and doing really well			0
@entity141 will be totally different for him but @entity2 's middle order is secure after a successful summer against @entity145			0
' yes it 's okay , ' @entity0 explained			1
' it 's an in to the team and i have to adjust			0
i had n't really batted at @entity149 before i batted there for @entity2 so i had to adjust to that and did that for a few years and really enjoyed it			0
it 's always nice to bat with @entity37 if i get the opportunity and he will be a familiar face if i go out there with him			1
there 's experience round the team so if i can add to that and contribute it would be really great			0
' it 's worked out really well			0
i had to go back to county cricket and do the hard yards to earn selection just as i did when i first played county cricket			0
i 've always thought that was the route i had to take			0
i had to go back and prove my case for selection			0
not just putting up my hand and saying ' i want to play now			0
' other guys have come in and done well so i had to go back and push my case			0
@entity0 looks sure to open with @entity37 ( left ) in the first test against @entity16 in @entity22 on monday then i had to go on the @entity43 tour			1
i remember @entity100 phoning me at the end of the season and at first i said " okay can i think about it " but then after a couple of weeks without playing it sounded like a good idea			0
you realise that six months is quite a long time without cricket in the life of a county player ! it was the next obvious step to pushing my case to being here today			0
' i 'm really glad i did it and a lot of credit goes to the @entity43			0
as a youngster the two tours i did with them helped my cricket and again now it 's been a case of the @entity43 helping me make the step up			0
i 'm really pleased with how it 's gone			0
' @entity0 believes his issues came from putting too high expectations on himself			1
' i think it was the culmination of playing a lot of cricket and having an imbalanced perspective of what i needed to do to succeed			0
i set myself unrealistically high expectations that i could n't achieve			1
it just started building and i could n't see the wood from the trees			0
you get into a situation where the expectations are almost inhuman			0
@entity0 is set for his first @entity12 appearance since his @entity6 turmoil against @entity11 18 months ago ' i would n't say my expectations have changed			1
i still have high expectations of myself but in different areas now			0
it 's just realising what 's important and having a balanced life			0
this game and the amount of time you spend on it can be all - encompassing so it 's good to have a balanced view and i 'm a big believer in that now			1
' @entity0 is adamant that his selection here does not represent a gamble for @entity2			1
' i do n't think so , ' he added			0
' whenever you select someone there 's an element of risk			0
nobody really knows i suppose but i feel great and it feels pretty similar to when i was first picked			0
' and he has no qualms about facing @entity241 and a certain @entity11 again this summer			1
' i 've faced them before , ' he smiled			0
and @entity0 has been smiling ever since he arrived here in the @entity244 .			1
