' this is a different environment and it 's good being around old friends			0
' and @entity5 looks a bit like the north of @entity8 , where i 'm from , so i 'm enjoying it			2
' saturday 's round - robin match would have been a dress rehearsal for the final but for @entity50 's disallowed try in the last minute of @entity8 's heartbreaking 16 - 12 defeat by the @entity52 in @entity12 on sunday but @entity0 insists they have moved on from that disappointment			1

' but it wo n't change our approach to the game			0
@entity8 take on @entity11 , who are in the box seat to confirm a place in the @entity15 final @entity93 scores for @entity11 against @entity16 - the @entity18 are the only undefeated side in the competition so far ' the @entity18 are big and strong and like to offload , so we 'll have to be good on defence			1
' they got one over us in the @entity78 semi-final last year and it would be good to get revenge but it 's not the main thing we 're focusing on			0
' we 've had to get over the disappointment of the loss to @entity17 quickly , but we 've looked at the game and seen some of the things we 've done well			0
' we 'll try to carry those forward to saturday night and correct the errors we made in @entity12			0
