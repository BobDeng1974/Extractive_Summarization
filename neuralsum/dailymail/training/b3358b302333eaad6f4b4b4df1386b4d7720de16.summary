rating : oh , how we all adored her in the @entity2 and @entity3 and , more important , loved her pretty patterned wallpapers and fabrics			1
we liked the back story , too - a business started on her kitchen table that grew to become a giant of @entity10			1
then , following @entity13 ’s death in 1985 , aged 60 , the company went through all kinds of boardroom changes and is currently owned by a @entity17 company - hence the incongruous @entity17 menu in the bar			1
' a poor advertisement for the @entity22 designer ' : the @entity23 does the @entity13 brand little service this is one of two @entity13 hotels and - sorry to report - it ’s a poor advertisement for the @entity22 designer			1
and this establishment , near @entity31 in @entity32 , does n’t do pretty			1
it does tinny mirrors , canned music and carpets in the corridors that are striped in such a way that the dark parts look grubby even though they are perfectly clean			1
and why bother to have real logs stored next to a fake fireplace ? my room is a standard jobby in the annexe connected via a walkway from the original manor house , parts of which date from 1540			1
it has all the exuberance of a late - night interview with foreign secretary @entity53			1
there is a bed , a small table , a @entity13 chair and an ironing board sticking out of a flimsy cupboard			1
not even a small bottle of complimentary water			2
instead , there is a @entity13 catalogue , @entity64 and a pad of paper			1
the bathroom is no more inspiring			2
it has one of those bidet / loo combos			2
working it sounds complicated , given the manual placed near the pan			2
there ’s a lot of talk about ‘ nozzle position ’ and ‘ cleansing the posterior ’			2
i ’m on a dinner , bed and breakfast rate ( £ 148 ) , for which i get three courses in the main dining room			0
but there is n’t a soul in it , so i opt for a table in the bar			0
i ask to order from the bar food menu rather than the posh one along the corridor			0
a waiter says he will find out if that ’s possible because there might be a supplement			0
‘ but the bar menu is cheaper than the restaurant menu , ’ i tell him			0
he goes off to check with the manager , but then a cheery @entity100 waitress cuts through the dross and says i can order what i like from whatever menu i like			0
and you know what ? i go down the incongruous @entity17 route - and then regret it			0
the beef curry tastes almost as awful as it looks - a brown mess with coconut spread on it like flakes of dandruff			0
i notice that a woman sitting on her own at a nearby table has asked for her main course to be removed and , no , she does not want it replaced			0
several conferences are gearing up in the morning			0
the buffet breakfast involves lots of stainless steel containers , with under - cooked bacon and watery scrambled eggs in them			0
at checkout , i ’m asked if ‘ everything was all right with your stay ? ’ i mumble and reach for a credit card			0

the other is @entity142 , which sits on the shore of @entity144
