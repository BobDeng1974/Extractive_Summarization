police are struggling to stop a @entity2 - based website from selling shoplifting tools as the administrator has managed to find a legal loophole			1
the @entity2 - based website , which will not be named by @entity6 , distributes a range of equipment for thieves which have been designed to remove security tags , allowing the shoplifter to remain undetected			1
there are calls for the online store to be shut down but despite investigations from the @entity17 , the website is currently not breaking any laws - even though it is distributing products that encourage and facilitate crime			1
the website founder , who wished to remain anonymous , told @entity6 that they are doing nothing wrong			2
the website even has ' how - to ' videos , where a young woman in a pink bra demonstrates how to use the products to foil a range of different security measures to steal clothes , sunglasses and liquor ' we are not doing anything new , there are many companies selling these ( products ) both direct to the public and to stores , ' he said			1
he also believes that shop owners should know that security tags are not an adequate measure to prevent theft			1
' there are currently no regulations on the sale of these products			0
' the website is also used to distribute their own line of clothing and point out that they would never trust security tags with their own products			1
' as we tell the stores who stock our clothing range , security tags should not be relied on as the only form of loss prevention			2
' the website has different tools which are used to unlock different security tags to facilitate illegal shoplifting the brand is hugely popular with almost 30,000 people following their @entity68 page			2
however it 's not known how many people are buying the shoplifting tools , which they call ' rack masters '			0
