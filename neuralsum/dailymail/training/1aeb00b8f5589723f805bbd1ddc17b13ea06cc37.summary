@entity1 head to @entity2 with plenty of confidence after rounding off their @entity6 warm - up matches by thrashing @entity7 8 - 0 on sunday , with striker @entity8 scoring two and creating two in an impressive display of attacking football			1
@entity8 picked out @entity13 for @entity1 's fourth goal and also created the second for midfielder @entity16 , who in turn set up @entity8 's second			1
star winger @entity19 was ruled out of the @entity6 on friday because of a lingering back injury but his absence could work in @entity1 's favor as the teamwork looks much improved			2
one down : @entity25 slides in to convert @entity13 's knock - down for @entity1 's first goal in form : @entity30 midfielder @entity16 was superb for @entity1 , scoring their second from just outside the box ' we 've lost a world - class player , ' @entity1 coach @entity34 said			1
' he 's not here , but we have other players			0
it 's about having collective strength			0
' @entity13 set up the opener for midfielder @entity25 , left back @entity42 crossed for @entity16 's second of the night , and @entity44 came off the bench to score two clinical goals			1
' it 's not easy to score eight goals			0
it 's good for confidence , although we wo n't be over-confident , ' @entity34 said			0
' we played with a lot of mobility , and there was a good understanding between the players			0
' less than a year ago , @entity8 was fighting for his place after a dismal run of 15 games without a goal , but has scored six in his past six and his international tally has improved to a respectable 21 in 66			2
this was @entity1 's heaviest win since a 10 - 0 thrashing of @entity66 in 1995			1
number three : @entity67 celebrates his first , and @entity1 's third , as they thrashed @entity7 in @entity70 deadly : @entity8 scored both his goals from the corner of the box cutting in from the left hand side without @entity19 , @entity34 will likely play with @entity8 in a roaming role and @entity13 at center forward against @entity77 in their @entity79 match on sunday			1
the @entity80 then play @entity81 and @entity82			0
' @entity8 and @entity13 are both in great shape , ' @entity34 said			1
@entity1 created early pressure , and @entity13 went close to heading in @entity86 's teasing cross from the left			1
the defense remains vulnerable to set pieces , however , and defender @entity90 almost gave the visitors a surprise lead			0
@entity1 took the lead in the 17th minute with a well - worked team goal			0
@entity86 found space on the edge of the penalty area , looped the ball up to @entity13 , who held off a defender before nodding the ball down to @entity25			2
sprinting into space , the @entity30 midfielder expertly controlled the ball on his chest before volleying home as he he slid along the ground			0
in control : @entity13 linked well with @entity8 , eventually converting a cross to make it four all together : @entity1 showed plenty of quality along with a team spirit which has been missing in the past the second goal came just three minutes later , as @entity8 picked out @entity16 , and the @entity30 midfielder smacked the ball inside the left post from 20 meters			1
@entity8 got his first in the 38th , playing a quick one - two with @entity86 on the edge of the box , before cutting inside his marker and curling the ball inside the right post			0
@entity8 showed his passing is just as good when , in the 53rd , he peeled away down the left flank and picked out @entity13 with a tight , curling pass and the @entity127 forward finished with a powerful shot into the left corner for his third goal in three games			1
@entity8 got his second in the 63rd with another emphatic finish , collecting @entity16 's clever reverse pass and hitting an unstoppable shot into the top left corner			1
three minutes later , @entity16 showed his finishing skills when he ran onto @entity42 's cross and clipped the ball past goalkeeper @entity141			2
little master : @entity86 was was excellent for @entity1 as part of a dangerous attacking trio with 20 minutes left , @entity8 went close to his hat trick with a thudding strike against the post , and @entity86 miscued from close range moments later			2
after @entity7 lost possession in midfield , @entity86 passed to @entity8 , who returned the pass only for @entity86 to lose his balance as he tried to control the ball			2
@entity44 was on hand to collect it , swivel and finish neatly in the 77th			0
his next goal , a back - heel flick in the 89th , was even better , rounding off the perfect send - off for @entity1 in front of their fans .			0

@entity1 put eight past @entity7 in final warm - up game
@entity8 , @entity16 and @entity167 all score twice
