by @entity1 reporter published : 23:47 est , 2 june 2012 updated : 00:01 est , 3 june 2012 the credibility of @entity5 's shooter could become an issue at trial after a @entity9 judge said that @entity10 and his wife lied to the court about their finances to obtain a bond , legal experts say			1
that 's because the case hinges on jurors believing @entity10 's account of what happened the night that the 17 - year - old @entity5 was killed			2
' the other key witness , unfortunately , is deceased , ' said @entity22 - area attorney @entity21 , a former prosecutor			0
' basically , @entity10 is going to be asking the jury to believe his version of the facts			2
... as the case stands now , his credibility is absolutely critical to the case			0
' revoked : @entity10 testifies from the stand during a bond hearing on second degree murder charges at the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity9 in this file photo taken april 20 , 2012 @entity10 's credibility would be important if his attorney , @entity36 , tries to get a judge without the jury to dismiss the charges based on the law , said @entity22 defense attorney @entity41			1
' if he was in on something that was not truthfully revealed to the judge , when there is a ` stand your ground ' hearing , of course you 're going to second - guess him , ' said @entity41			2
the revocation of @entity10 's bond also puts pressure on @entity36 not to delay the trial , @entity21 said			1
' when your client is out on bond , the pressure is much lighter to rush to trial ... because your client is sitting at home , " he said			0
' when your client is sitting at the @entity60 , your client is going to want this resolved			0
' the questioning of @entity10 's truthfulness by the judge on friday could undermine the defendant 's credibility if it is brought up at trial			2
it also may complicate how his defense presents him as a witness			0
@entity10 , charged with killing 17 - year - old @entity5 , right , stands next to a @entity71 during a court hearing in @entity33 @entity10 had not turned himself in as of early saturday evening , the day after his bond was revoked			1
he must do so by sunday afternoon			0
he went into hiding in the weeks after the shooting amid an impassioned debate about the case , and his exact whereabouts since he bonded out of jail remain unclear			0
it also was not immediately clear exactly where @entity10 would surrender			2
as he revoked @entity10 's bail on friday , the judge said mr @entity10 had responsibilities to stop his wife , who testified at one hearing , and his lawyer from making false statements			1
' mr @entity10 ca n't sit back a potted palm and let his wife testify falsely before the court when he knew well in advance of the hearing the amounts of money in controversy , ' said judge @entity97			1
case : @entity10 , right , shot @entity5 , left , in february during a confrontation at a gated community of townhouses in @entity33 , @entity9 , where @entity10 lived and where @entity5 was visiting his father 's fiancee ' he ca n't sit back and obtain the benefit of a lower bond based upon those material falsehoods			1
' under @entity9 's @entity108 , a judge has discretion to revoke a defendant 's bail if he finds there 's ' good cause ' to do so			2
lying to a court about one 's finances apparently fits the bill			0
in arguing for @entity10 's bail to be revoked , prosecutors asserted his wife @entity120 ' flat - out lied ' to get a lower bail			1
' this court was led to believe that [ @entity10 and his wife ] did n't have a single penny , ' one prosecutor argued			1
a @entity32 sheriff 's deputy waits for @entity10 in front of the @entity60 after @entity10 's bond was revoked in @entity33 , @entity9 but it turns out the @entity130 had collected about $ 200,000 in online donations via a website -- a fact @entity10 's attorney @entity36 has acknowledged			1
in addition , @entity10 and his wife ' spoke in code to hide what they were doing ' during jail telephone calls , prosecutors alleged			1
prosecutors also used phone conversations recorded between @entity10 and his wife @entity120 , to show that the pair intentionally deceived the court by talking in code that designates multiples of thousands to much lower sums			1
@entity10 asks : ' in my account do i have at least $ 100 ? @entity151 responds : ' $ 8			2
$ 8.60 ' bailed : neighborhood watch volunteer @entity10 ( @entity152 ) leaves the @entity60 in april after posting bail in @entity33 , @entity9 defense attorney @entity36 said the fact that @entity10 and his wife never used the money for anything indicated ' there was no deceit			1
' since his release in late april , @entity10 has been staying at an undisclosed location for his safety			2
prosecutor @entity162 described the @entity130 ' testimony as ' misleading '			0
' this court was led to believe they did n't have a single penny , ' said @entity162			0
' it was misleading and i do n't know what words to use other than it was a blatant lie			0
' the judge said he would schedule a hearing after @entity10 is back in custody so the neighborhood watch leader could explain himself			1
it was also revealed that @entity10 kept a second passport at his home and he and his wife can be heard to discuss it			2
' i have one for you in the safety deposit box , ' said @entity181			0
' okay , you hold onto that , ' replied @entity10			0
shot dead : in this undated photo provided by the @entity5 family , @entity5 holds an unidentified baby			0
@entity5 was killed by a neighborhood watchman following an altercation in @entity33 , @entity9 as he walked from a convenience store in february , 2012 @entity10 is pleading not guilty to second - degree murder and claims self - defense			1
@entity10 shot @entity5 in february during a confrontation at a gated community of townhouses in @entity33 , @entity9 , where @entity10 lived and where the 17 - year - old @entity5 was visiting his father 's fiancee			0
@entity196 , an attorney for @entity5 's parents , @entity198 and @entity199 , said his clients have always said @entity10 should remain in jail until trial , which @entity36 said he believed would n't be until next year			1
@entity196 was asked if he thought that if @entity10 would be willing to lie about his finances that he would be willing to lie about what happen the night @entity5 was killed			0
' we fully expect that the special prosecutor will make @entity10 's credibility be front and center in this entire case , ' @entity196 said			2
' and whatever dishonesty that comes forth by @entity10 that they can prove , you can best believe it will be the issue of this case and rightfully so			2
prosecutors also said @entity10 had failed to surrender a second passport , but the judge dismissed that concern as the equivalent of someone who has lost a driver 's license , applies for a new one and then finds the old driver 's license			1
killed : @entity10 is pleading not guilty to second - degree murder and claims self - defense in the shooting death of @entity5 the delay in an arrest for 44 days prompted protests nationwide and led to @entity33 's police chief stepping aside so emotions could cool down			2
at friday 's court hearing , @entity162 and @entity36 also asked a judge to stop the public release of witness names and statements made by @entity10 to police officers			1
those documents normally are part of the public record under @entity9 law			0
@entity10 started a website to raise funds for his legal defence under the url www.therealgeorgezimmerman.com in april			1
‘ i have created a @entity247 account solely linked on this website as i would like to provide an avenue to thank my supporters personally and ensure that any funds provided are used only for living expenses and legal defence , ’ he posted on the website in april according to prosecutors , he allegedly raised $ 135,000 but the website was shut down on april 24 so his attorney could regain control of the fundraising drive			1
the 28 - year - old 's bond hearing was on april 20 , where the amount of money the website had raised was not disclosed			1
@entity10 was released from jail on april 23 on a $ 150,000 bond after paying 10 per cent upfront			1
later that week , his lawyer told @entity269 that the website had raised more than $ 200,000 in donations			2
' what 's occurring , unfortunately , are cases are being tried in the public sector as opposed to in the courtroom , ' @entity272 said			0
' we are in a new age with @entity279 , @entity280 , and all these things i 've never heard of before in my career			0
everybody gets to find out intimate details about witnesses that never occurred before			0
witnesses are going to be reluctant to get involved			0
' a consortium of more than a dozen media groups , including the @entity290 , asked the judge to ignore the request , saying such records are presumed to be publicly available under @entity9 law			0
@entity295 , an attorney for the @entity296 , cited the @entity298 trial as an example of a highly publicized case in which a jury was able to be seated despite intense media coverage			0
the @entity9 mother was acquitted last year of killing her 2 - year - old daughter			0
' @entity305 in @entity9 has traditionally been open ... and @entity9 has n't encountered problems seating juries and giving defendants fair trials , ' @entity295 said			0
@entity36 said friday on a website that he does n't expect the case to be ready for trial until next year			1
@entity36 said he expects to call on 50 witnesses who need to be deposed before he decides whether to file a " stand your ground " motion which would ask for a hearing before a judge without a jury			1
at the hearing , @entity10 would argue self - defense under the @entity9 law which gives wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat in a fight if people believe they are in danger of being killed or seriously injured			1
the outside of @entity60 , the @entity330 prior to the return of @entity10			0

experts question whether the case is now *compromised* because judge @entity97 accused @entity10 and his wife of deceiving the court over funds available for his bail bond
prosecutors claim @entity10 had $ 135,000 available that had been raised by a website he set up
defense attorney @entity36 said @entity10 and his wife never used the money for anything
the judge said he would schedule a hearing after @entity10 is back in custody so the neighborhood watch leader could explain himself
