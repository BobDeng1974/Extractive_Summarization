by @entity0 @entity1 's has combined two fast food favorites into an indulgent and mouth - watering new dish : chicken crust pizza			1
' @entity7 ' is made with 12 pieces of breaded , boneless chicken as a base and topped with pizza add - ons like cheese , sauces , vegetables and meats			1
@entity21 gamely sampled each of the four different flavors - crispy bacon and tomato , classic hot buffalo , spicy jalapeno - pineapple and sweet barbecue bacon - ahead of its april 21 release , and the verdicts were overwhelmingly positive			1
the ultimate combination : @entity1 's has combined two fast food favorites into an indulgent new dish called @entity7 , which consists of breaded chicken bites with pizza cheese and toppings ' i think their focus group is a brilliant bunch of college kids , ' surmised @entity36 editor @entity35			1
' i want to order this at 2am after a night of drinking			0
' she added that the standout ' by far ' was the jalapeno and pineapple flavor			0
' it 's sweet and spicy and i would eat three boxes of it			2
' @entity49 editor @entity48 agreed			0
' not much can fail to be improved by melted cheese , and this rule is true of breaded chicken , ' she said			0
' the buffalo flavor was an easy favorite , ditto the barbecue sauce version			0
the pineapple jalapeno was a surprise hit though			0
it 's so retro , but somehow it works			2
' indeed , spicy jalapeno - pineapple was the flavor that really won over the office , followed by the sweet barbecue bacon , although some complained that this one could use some improvement			2
' the barbeque chicken was really good and i would happily order it and eat it , ' said @entity35			0
' but it is a bit messier , since it 's saucier , and could benefit from more cheese			2
' on the menu : it comes in four different flavors - crispy bacon and tomato , classic hot buffalo , spicy jalapeno - pineapple and sweet barbecue bacon she also noted that @entity1 's could venture even further into chicken menu items by producing more varieties of this new dish			1
' they should offer a grilled option as well , ' she said			0
' the breading was n't that integral			0
and i 'm sure people cutting carbs or allergic to gluten will celebrate this alternative way to pig out on pizza flavors			2
' photo editor @entity94 also suggested toning down the bread crumbs , which ' could help the flavor of the sauce and chicken come through '			0
' the pineapple jalapeno was a surprise hit			0
it 's so retro , but somehow it works ' more like a box of chicken fingers than a pizza pie , @entity7 is ' one of the most creative , innovative menu items we have ever had , ' said @entity107 , @entity108 chief marketing officer			1
' our pizza chefs have taken chicken to a whole new level , using our unique ingredients to create these four bold flavors			2
there 's nothing quite like @entity1 's @entity7 on the market today			1
' @entity7 , will be part of the pizza chain 's $ 5.99 mix and match deal , which lets you order one of the four flavors as well as another item from the menu			1
winning flavor : spicy jalapeno - pineapple ( pictured ) was the flavor that won us over			0
' it 's sweet and spicy and i would eat three boxes of it , ' said @entity21 editor @entity35 according to @entity133 , executive vice president at restaurant research firm @entity134 , this move by @entity1 's to create more innovative chicken dishes may well be a smart one			1
' [ chicken ] has a little bit more halo than red meats , ' he told @entity141 , explaining that consumers tend to see it as a ' healthier ' option ( though the calorie count for @entity7 has yet to be released )			2
but , he added , it 's also a risky move			0
' every time a pizza chain tries to diversity , it usually does n't work so well , ' he said			1
judging by the ad for @entity7 , @entity1 's is fully aware that it is something of a gamble			1
get ready : @entity7 will be part of the chain 's $ 5.99 mix and match deal and will launch officially on april 21 ' you know , at @entity1 's , failure is an option , ' says a man in the commercial			1
and @entity1 's ' chicken chef ' @entity163 explains : ' if we gave up after every mistake , we would n't come up with something really special like our new @entity7			1
' in related fast food news , it was revealed today that @entity170 will be relaunching its @entity172 meal , a bacon and cheese sandwich with fried chicken filets instead of bread			0
according to @entity141 , the sandwich will be available starting april 21 - coincidentally , the same day as @entity1 's @entity7 - for a limited time only .			1

@entity21 put the pizza chain 's new @entity7 to the test - with overwhelmingly positive verdicts
