@entity0 : an artist 's impression of the new 73 - story skyscraper that could be built in @entity5 's @entity4			1
if the plan is green - lit , it will be @entity8 's tallest residential tower a 73 - storey skyscraper is set to become the tallest residential tower in @entity8			2
a @entity8 architectural firm have submitted plans for a slim £ 400 million , 250 metre skyscraper in @entity5 's @entity4 that will break the record for the nation 's tallest block of flats			1
@entity18 have submitted plans to the local authority , @entity19 , for the towering building to add to the capital 's soaring skyline			1
if built it will take the record from @entity25 , also known as the @entity25 or @entity26 , a 181 metre , 50 - storey residential skyscraper in @entity28			2
the proposed apartment block will involve the demolition of office blocks on the @entity32 on the @entity33 to create 947 new homes			1
the development also includes a 36 - storey tower fronting onto @entity37 to accompany the @entity39 building			2
the proposals also outline approximately 20,000 sq. ft. of new retail , dining and entertainment space and will also include a public open space with a riverside walkway			0
@entity46 , managing director of @entity47 , which is working with the architects , said : ' @entity32 has a vital role to play in revitalising this dockside location - we have been working closely with the @entity52 and the @entity53 and , with their support , aim to create over 900 homes and more than 1.5 acres of landscaped open space			2
' opportunities to deliver such significant public realm in @entity59 are few and far between			0
' the planning application was submitted in early april and @entity47 will be working with @entity61 to secure planning permission later in the year			0
construction is likely to start in january 2015			0
compared to many other world - class cities , @entity5 had very few tall buildings until the development of @entity59 in 1988 and , later , the @entity67 and the @entity68			1
as well as the 73 - storey building , the plans include retail and entertainment space and a walkway if it is approved by council planners , work on the scheme could start early next year in march an architectural think - tank claimed 236 buildings of more than 20 storeys could be on the way , four fifths of them intended as high - rise blocks of flats			0

the @entity68 ( left ) , @entity5 's tallest building and the 37 - storey 20 @entity105 ( right ) , better known as the ' @entity103 ' , is currently under construction foreign investors from @entity108 , who are buying into @entity5 property in unprecedented numbers , are also having an effect as they are comfortable with tall buildings which have long been part of the urban landscape in that region			1
the mayor 's office is trying to strike a balance between protection of the city 's historic skyline and the need to house a million more people and create half - a - million new jobs , said sir @entity126 , deputy mayor for planning			1
' tall buildings will not be appropriate in many locations , ' @entity128 , head of @entity129 and developer planning from @entity131 told @entity134			0

it is the latest skyscraper to join @entity5 's *increasingly* *crowded* skyline
