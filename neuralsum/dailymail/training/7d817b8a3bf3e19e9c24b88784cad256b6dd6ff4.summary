@entity1 fans may be desperate to see @entity2 in the centres but @entity5 head coach @entity4 believes the star ’s future will be as a ‘ barn - storming ’ back row			1
after the former @entity12 and @entity1 rugby league player made his debut against @entity14 on friday night , both @entity10 and @entity2 faced a barrage of questions about the 25 - year - old ’s future position			1
@entity2 , who was at @entity19 for @entity1 ’s win over @entity21 yesterday , came on in the centres at @entity23 on friday			2
@entity2 charges into the @entity14 defence with his first touch of the ball in rugby union there was plenty of excitement at the @entity31 as rugby league superstar @entity2 was named on the bench while @entity10 plans to play him in the midfield over the coming weeks , he will eventually be moved into the forwards - despite @entity1 ’s shortage at @entity36			1
‘ he ’ll play his first few games at 12 but we ’re going to have a look at him in the back row as well			2
i think that will suit him more , ’ said @entity4			0
‘ he ’s a guy who carries a lot and tackles a lot , you ca n’t stick him out in the centres and let him do nothing because that ’s not his skillset			0
‘ can he get over the gain - line with six , seven or eight on his back ? course he can			0
@entity5 head coach @entity4 believes @entity2 will be a ' barn - storming ' back row forward in the long run ‘ after six or seven weeks we ’ll know what his best position is			1
my vision is for him to be a barn - storming back row			1
’ @entity2 was given 18 minutes of action for @entity5 but made a limited impact , despite two positive carries and one clear out at the breakdown			2
‘ i just wanted to touch the ball , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s great to get that monkey off my back and to be part of the team			0
