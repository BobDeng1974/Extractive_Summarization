by @entity0 for @entity1 social media rumours of a planned terrorist attack on the @entity4 have today been quashed by police			1
last night hoax emails and texts warning @entity4 commuters to avoid the @entity4 today because of a specific terrorist threat snowballed on social media			1
they appeared to have been triggered by the recent decision to raise the terrorist threat alert to its highest state in three years			2
the hoax message read : ' in case you have anyone in @entity4			1
do n't travel on the tubes tomorrow			0
' every single police officer in the @entity23 has been called into work from 4am onwards , even people on holiday are being told to catch the next flight home			0
@entity28 , from the @entity27 , quickly dispelled the rumours with his own tweet @entity32 @entity31 also dispelled the rumours , clearly stating they were a ' hoax ' the hoax was spread widely before police confirmed rumours of a specific threat were ' completely untrue ' police have reassured commuters there is no need to be alarmed and asked they ' keep calm and carry on ' it goes on : ' they think there 's a terror threat and that it will happen on the tubes tomorrow around the west end area			1
so do n't go travelling on tubes			0
it 's better to be safe than sorry			0
' police moved quickly to dispel the misinformation , with a @entity23 spokesman saying the rumour was ' completely untrue '			1
several senior officers also responded via @entity55			0
@entity31 , @entity56 , tweeted : ' rumour control : the " alert " doing the rounds on social about all @entity23 officers being called in for 4am tomorrow is a hoax			1
' and @entity28 , @entity63 for @entity4 , posted : ' social media contains lots of rumours regarding threats to tube network tomorrow			2
there is no specific threat so keep calm & carry on			0
' while there has been an increased police presence at some stations , police say there is no specific threat the rumours spread quickly over @entity55 last night as they were shared and retweeted although there was concern caused by the hoax , police told everyone the rumour was ' completely untrue ' the rumour was likely to have started after the @entity85 raised the terror threat alert to ' severe ' on friday home secretary @entity87 raised the terror threat level from ' substantial ' to ' severe '			1
despite stating there was no ' specific ' threat when raising it , this appears to have been overlooked in last night 's social media panic			2
prime minster @entity93 has said the public can expect to see an increase in high - profile police patrols , including the greater use of armed officers , particularly at airports and major railway stations			0
he called for the public to be vigilant but added they should not panic , saying @entity103 had shown ‘ resolve ’ in the face of terror before .			0

hoax message spread on social media *claiming* the @entity4 is under threat
@entity23 quickly dispelled it , saying : ' this rumour is completely untrue '
appears to have started after terror threat alert was raised on friday
