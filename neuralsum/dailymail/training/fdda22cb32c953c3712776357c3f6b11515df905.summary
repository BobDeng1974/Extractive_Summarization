a @entity1 man who at one time was the fattest in the world is pleading with the @entity4 to remove unsightly flaps of flesh after he managed to lose more than half of his body weight			1
@entity9 , 50 , who weighed 60 stone two years ago , underwent a gastric bypass after he was told he otherwise faced certain death			2
but he has been left with rolls of unsightly excess skin after the extreme weight loss and now needs an operation to remove the flaps hanging from his stomach , arms and legs			1
but mr @entity9 , who can now leave the house in a motorised wheelchair , said : ' i just need a little bit more help			1
i feel like i have been just left high and dry			1
' i need this operation to be able to get my life back , to be able to get back into society			2
it is stopping me living a reasonable life			0
' the former postman , who weighed 70st - or half a tonne - at his heaviest , used to consume 20,000 calories a day , 10 times the normal for the average man			2
he said his binge eating was spurred by heartbreak in his twenties at the time of his father 's death and a deterioration in his mother 's health			0
he quit his job as a postman when his weight prevented him from completing his deliveries			0
he was transferred to a sorting office , where he worked until 1989 when he was sacked and imprisoned for six months for stealing from customers ' letters			0
@entity63 : @entity9 in his motorised chair , in early 2011 , on a rare day out near his home in @entity66 after losing 20st @entity9 , pictured in 2009 , was airlifted to hospital for an operation to reduce his weight the former postman used to consume 20,000 calories a day -10 times the normal for the average man - and sometimes went naked to avoid having to get dressed mr @entity9 spent around £ 30,000 a year on food and sometimes went naked to avoid having to get dressed			1
then in 2009 , mr @entity9 , from @entity66 , underwent a £ 30,000 operation on the @entity4 at @entity73 which drastically reduced the amount he could eat			1
now his frame has shrunk so much that he has been left with swathes of loose skin			2
surgery can be used to remove the excess skin but as the treatment is for cosmetic and not clinical reasons , it is not automatically available on the @entity4			1
mr @entity9 has been left with rolls of unsightly excess skin on his arms , legs and stomach it will cost mr @entity9 around £ 1,500 to £ 6,000 if he wants to have the surgery privately depending on the amount of flesh that needs to be removed mr @entity9 will have to pay around £ 1,500 to £ 6,000 if he wants to have the surgery privately depending on the amount of flesh that needs to be removed			1
his care bill costs taxpayers an estimated £ 100,000 a year and it is believed to have topped £ 1million over the past 15 years on one occasion firefighters had to be called out to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002			1
now and then : @entity9 says he is desperate for plastic surgery			2
he is pictured at 18 - months - old ( right ) @entity105 's old diet breakfast : a packet of bacon , four sausages , four eggs , bread and hash browns			0
lunch : four portions of fish and chips with two kebabs			0
dinner : a takeaway such as a curry or pizza snacks : pastries , chocolate , crisps ( he would spend £ 10 - £ 15 per day on chocolate and £ 60 a day on takeaways ) @entity105 's new diet breakfast : toast lunch or dinner : now he has just one main meal a day usually consisting of lean meat fresh fruit and vegetables but mr @entity9 , who has a a new target weight of 23 stone , is angered by the @entity4 's decision			1
he said : ' my consultant says he 's always seen there is a skinny man waiting to get out but it is so frustrating to have got so far and just be at the final hurdle			2
' i have times when i just sit and cry but then i think " i 'm not going to let it get me down			0
" ' health bosses have remained firm about their decision , stating that mr @entity9 , who also suffered a heart attack following his gastric bypass , must wait before he has further cosmetic surgery			1
an @entity156 spokesperson said : ' before a patient has an operation it is important to take a balanced decision that is in the best interest of that patient			0
' in cases like this @entity156 has a panel of people - including clinicians - who decide whether the patient should have such an operation			0
' a patient must have a stable weight before he or she is considered			1
' mr @entity9 also claimed that the @entity4 failed to help him as his size soared and instead of receiving a treatment programme to manage his weight , he said he was told in 1996 : ' ride your bike more			1
' he now hopes to learn how to drive and to use his experience to help others with eating disorders , including anorexia			0
he has also set up his own craft company to produce @entity184 tree decorations and birthday cards			0
the heaviest man of all time was @entity189 @entity188 , who weighed 100.2 stone			0
he died in 1983 aged 42			0
two female carers take up to four hours to wash @entity9 because his size makes it impossible for him to clean himself			2
the women , who visit him three times a day , have to apply cream to every inch of his bulging body to stop chafing			0
he manages to soap his upper body himself and the nurses wipe him down			0
they used to look after him from 8am until 8pm but @entity4 were forced to axe the service because of cutbacks			2
mr @entity9 , who wears incontinence pads , has not walked properly since 2000 and wears size @entity205 clothes .			1
