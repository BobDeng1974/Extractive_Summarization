two babies were born with incurable diseases after shocking blunders in @entity4 treatment that should have screened out the dangerous inherited conditions			1
both mothers had gone to the same clinic to ensure they did not pass on life - limiting illnesses that ran in their families			1
but mistakes at a laboratory used by the @entity4 clinic resulted in the outcome the women had so desperately wanted to avoid			1
one mother wanted to screen out sickle cell anaemia – a serious blood disorder that can lead to complications including strokes , breathing problems and high blood pressure			1
the other patient wanted to stop her child from developing neurofibromatosis , which causes tumours to grow along the body ’s nerves and can reduce a sufferer ’s lifespan by up to 15 years			1
but after mistakes by a laboratory used by the clinic , both women became pregnant and gave birth to babies who had these illnesses			1
the mix - up is revealed in a report which has been published by the @entity46 ( @entity46 )			1
the couple whose baby has neurofibromatosis – which carries the risk of major problems including learning difficulties and cancer – were ‘ distraught ’ when the clinic broke the news , according to the medical director of @entity58 , @entity59			1
a spokeswoman for @entity46 said last night : ‘ these two incidents are very serious and have no doubt been devastating for the couples involved			2
they had treatment to have a healthy child but may now have children affected by a serious genetic condition			0
’ the two mothers ’ identities have not been disclosed			2
they originally went to the clinic for a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis ( @entity73 ) – a cutting - edge technique that allows genetic testing of an embryo for inherited diseases before it is implanted as part of @entity4 treatment			1
under strict regulations , this type of screening is available only to women who are at high risk of passing on a serious genetic disorder			2
the clinic , which also treats @entity88 patients , charges £ 4,840 to screen for a single gene disorder			1
it is not known if the two women were being treated on the @entity88 or privately			0
the clinic screens its embryo samples at a @entity58 laboratory run by @entity95 ( @entity96 )			0
describing itself as a pioneer in screening embryos for inherited genetic abnormalities , the company ’s products include @entity103 , which it calls ‘ the best performing non invasive prenatal test ’			2
the mother whose child developed neurofibromatosis began @entity4 treatment in june 2013			1
the lab reported back to the clinic that three of her embryos were affected by neurofibromatosis , but two were clear			1
the clinic discarded the three embryos with the gene disorder			2
of the two embryos deemed by the lab to be free of the genetic defect , one was frozen for future use and the second was implanted in the would - be mother ’s womb			0
shortly after the woman was told she was pregnant			0
but the next day the lab contacted the clinic to say the @entity73 results had been misinterpreted by its staff			0
the implanted embryo had the defective gene , while the three discarded had been healthy			0
the clinic told the woman and her partner about the mistake two days later and she had to decide whether to have an abortion or continue with the pregnancy			0
she opted to keep the child , who is believed to have been born in early 2014			0
in the case of the second woman , sickle cell anaemia ran in her family and she already had a child with the condition			1
the woman had @entity4 treatment and genetic screening of her embryos in 2008 , but did not become pregnant			2
after this first attempt she had two frozen embryos stored at the @entity58 clinic			0
four years later she decided to have these transferred to a @entity154 fertility centre to be implanted and this time the procedure was successful			0
but after the woman gave birth , tests revealed the baby has sickle cell anaemia			1
the @entity58 lab had failed to utilise newer techniques that were unavailable in 2008 that would have increased the likelihood of the condition being screened out			0
an @entity46 spokeswoman said last night that after an investigation it was satisfied the neurofibromatosis case was an ‘ isolated incident ’ rather than due to poor practice			2
the regulator stressed that @entity172 had now introduced a system for retesting frozen embryos where necessary			0
professor @entity175 , managing director of @entity4 clinics , confirmed the continued use of the @entity95 laboratory services			0
‘ although we are very upset that the misdiagnosis occurred , there is always an element of risk with cutting - edge medicine , ’ he said			2
@entity95 @entity186 laboratory director @entity185 said : ‘ the matters in question are subject to ongoing , complex investigations and proceedings			0

both mothers went to same clinic to ensure they did not pass on life - limiting illnesses
but a mix - up happened at lab used by @entity4 clinic
one had wanted to screen out serious blood disorder , sickle cell anaemia
other patient wanted to stop her child from developing neurofibromatosis
but both women became pregnant and gave birth to babies who had these illnesses
the fertility watchdog has damned the incidents as ‘ grade a ’ errors
