@entity0 : punters can lose up to £ 300 a minute on betting terminals , according to the study published yesterday by the @entity4 betting terminals nicknamed the ‘ crack cocaine of gambling ’ are each making bookmakers more than £ 47,000 a year , according to a report			1
punters bet £ 8.6billion on the machines last year and lost £ 1.6billion – giving the bookies a profit margin of 19 per cent , it says			1
when winning and losing bets are added up , a total of £ 46billion was wagered on the fixed odds betting terminals where customers can lose up to £ 300 a minute , according to the study published yesterday by the @entity4			1
the campaign group , which is demanding that the maximum stake be slashed to £ 2 , also claims that bookmakers have targeted the machines at poorer areas , a claim hotly disputed by the gambling industry			1
there are more than 34,000 @entity26 in the country and with total profits at £ 1.6billion each machine made £ 47,320			2
the report says that in the 55 most deprived boroughs of the country – representing the poorest quarter of the population – punters staked £ 13billion in 2,691 betting shops last year			1
they lost £ 470million of this money			2
by contrast in the wealthiest quarter of councils customers staked £ 6.5billion over the same period in 1,258 bookmakers , losing only £ 231million of it			1
while punters using @entity46 lost an average of £ 1,096 last year in the poorest districts , those in the wealthiest boroughs lost an average of £ 519 , it says			2
the report also finds that while the number of betting shops has risen across the country by 288 to 9,343 over the last year , the number actually fell in the @entity57 , where bookmakers appear to make less money from the machines			2
the average fixed odds gambler lost £ 776 last year in the @entity57 , but in the @entity62 where punters lost £ 1,371 , the number of betting shops soared by 8 per cent last year			1

money making : there are more than 34,000 @entity26 in the country and with total profits at £ 1.6billion each machine made £ 47,320 the code , in force from this week , means @entity85 punters in @entity86 and @entity87 can set their own limits and ensures they will receive on screen alerts after 30 minutes or if £ 250 is spent			2
the @entity90 brought in the code as it awaits a report into the dangers of @entity46 , which is widely expected to lead to a @entity96 crackdown			0
last night the association hit back at the @entity99 report			0
@entity100 , the association ’s chief executive , said : ‘ the @entity103 allegation is total fantasy , and we can prove it			0

‘ like any retailer , we base our decisions on factors such as population density , footfall and rental costs			0
we do n’t want problem gamblers in our shops			0
’ the association claimed the number of betting shops is actually declining			0
