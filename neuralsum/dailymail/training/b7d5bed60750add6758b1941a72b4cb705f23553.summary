one of the world 's weirdest fish made a rare appearance above the water in these incredible pictures			2
photographer @entity5 captured the bizarre - looking @entity7 mola fish off the coast of @entity9 when it surfaced to snack on the @entity11 - a tiny sea creature similar to a jelly fish			1
but short of shying from the attention , the mola appeared to pucker up for the camera			2
sharks and rays can be heavier , but they 're cartilaginous fish			2
@entity22 develop their truncated , bullet - like shape because the back fin which they are born with simply never grows			2
instead , it folds into itself as the enormous creature matures , creating a rounded rudder called a clavus			0
@entity7 in @entity36 means ' millstone ' and describes the ocean sunfish â€™s somewhat circular shape			0
they are a silvery color and have a rough skin texture			0
@entity7 are found in temperate and tropical oceans around the world			0
they are frequently seen basking in the sun near the surface and are often mistaken for sharks when their huge dorsal fins emerge above the water			2
their teeth are fused into a beak - like structure , and they are unable to fully close their relatively small mouths			0
source : @entity56 also known as the ocean sunfish , the creature can grow up to 13 feet ( four metres ) long and weigh more than 4,400 pounds ( 2,000 kg )			1
they are sometimes mistaken for sharks when their dorsal fin sticks up out of the water			0
they feed on @entity64 , also known as the ' by - the - wind - sailors ' , which live on the surface and feed on plankton and small fish			1
mola mola swim at depths of up to 2,000 feet ( 600 metres ) and spend much of their lives submerged at depths of more than 660 feet ( 200 metres ) , which is why it is rare to spot them at the surface of water			1
indeed , they tend to live out in the open ocean rather than near shores or the surface			1
@entity85 was on board the whale watching boat the @entity89 in @entity90 when she spotted the incredible sight			1
@entity85 said : ' we normally see them resting just below the surface so this was very unusual			0
' we were able to watch it as it honed in on one by - the - wind - sailor after another , slurping each into its open mouth , then squirting out a jet of unwanted sea water			0
' they swim in a curious , rather clumsy fashion for a fish , wagging their tall dorsal and ventral fins and stubby tails			0
' they prefer to feed on jellyfish , but we had the rare opportunity to see one feeding on by - the - wind - sailors			0
' a @entity7 mola has not been seen in @entity90 for more than eight years photographer and environmentalist @entity5 captured the bizarre - looking @entity7 mola fish off the coast of @entity9 when it surfaced to snack on the @entity11 ( shown ) , a tiny sea creature similar to a jelly fish @entity22 , or @entity22 , are the heaviest of all the bony fish but tend to live in deeper waters and are rarely seen near the surface short of shying from the attention , the @entity7 mola appeared to pucker up for the camera @entity85 continued : ' using a special technique to nab the small sailors on the ocean 's surface , the @entity22 raised its head out of the water , slurped up the small sailor , then spat it out			1
' the mola mola isthe heaviest of all the bony fish , while they are tame and appear listless , they 're difficult to photograph because they are deceptively fast and generally do not like when divers come near them			1
in addition to this , the sighting was rare - a @entity7 mola has not been spotted in this @entity9 bay for more than eight years			1
in this separate photo from 2012 photojournalist @entity145 came across the moon - shaped @entity22 while snapping pictures of blue whales off @entity150 the @entity22 can grow up to 13 feet ( four metres ) long and weigh more than 4,400 pounds ( 2,000 kg ) @entity85 said : ' we normally see them resting just below the surface so this was very unusual ' @entity22 are sometimes mistaken for sharks when their dorsal fin sticks up out of the water			1
