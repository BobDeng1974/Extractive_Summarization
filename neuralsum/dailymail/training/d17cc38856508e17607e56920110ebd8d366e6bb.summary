by @entity0 i began collecting @entity3 stickers with my five - year - old son @entity4 several weeks ago			1
this was my attempt to indoctrinate him into the football world and to initiate his journey as a lover of the game - a journey which we all know will be full of ecstatic highs and lows of anguish			2
what better place to begin the wee lad ’s journey than in @entity20 ? home : @entity20 will provide a brilliant backdrop to the @entity3 , but do n't expect them to win the tournament to an extent , my mission has succeeded			1
he is aware that the @entity3 is coming and that there are many teams taking part , but he still ca n’t get his head round why @entity32 are not going to be there ! many more of us feel the same			1
i have enjoyed the process of opening the little packets to reveal the next exciting group of players who will be there in @entity20 to thrill us with their skills			1
for the amount of money i have now invested i could have sent him there to see the @entity47 live ! one regret from my playing days is that i never played in a @entity3			1
perhaps i will have the opportunity as a @entity32 coach to go to one			2
as we left the pitch at @entity54 last week , @entity51 commented on the performance of the @entity56 that night			2
‘ imagine going to a @entity3 with that lot , ’ he said			1
i dare to imagine ! support : the @entity20 national team will be under pressure to perform on home soil as the opening match approaches the excitement is growing			1
who ’s in each squad ? who ’s left out ? who ’s injured ? who will be the stars ? which team will be the surprise package ? ultimately , who will win this magnificent football fiesta ? many pundits have the host nation as the team to beat			1
i ’m afraid i ’m going to be a party pooper and disagree			2
i believe that , having won @entity79 , they will exit at the first knockout stage , where they will lose to the team who finishes second in @entity83 - most likely @entity84 , but possibly @entity85			2
unlike some of the other contenders , i do n’t believe they have strong enough attacking options			2
there are only six teams who can win the competition			2
i recommend that you extrapolate the draw on the wallchart included within today ’s paper and i guarantee that most of us will arrive at very similar outcomes			0
come together : a host of world class players including @entity101 ( above ) will be on show in the semi-finals , i have @entity104 playing the @entity84 and @entity105 facing @entity85			1
i would love the @entity47 to be between @entity85 and @entity105 but the draw makes that seem unlikely			1
keeping the best players healthy and fresh can be key to a prolonged run in the tournament			2
those teams who enjoy a more straightforward group stage will benefit over those teams who have to fight every step of the way to make the first knockout stage			0
@entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 find themselves in just such a group and could suffer as a @entity51 took over the national team , we discussed at length what we could possibly do to improve performances and results			0
during those deliberations , i mentioned that i was often struck by how much more sophisticated the playing style of many @entity132 club sides and international teams was in comparison to ours and , indeed , @entity119 ’s			0
teams place far greater emphasis on technique and on ball retention than many @entity141 teams do			0
the outstanding difference , though , is in the shape of teams and the variety and complexity of the movement that they achieve within their various systems			0
the @entity141 model is far too rigid and relies too heavily on the strength of individual players than a more joined - up team performance			0
the individual is important and can often be the difference between winning and not winning but that is secondary to the team plan which is designed to make it as difficult as possible for the opposition to mark and track match - winning players			0
pedigree : @entity163 's @entity162 will be one to watch during the @entity3 in @entity20 it gives the flair players space and time to exploit the opposition ’s weaknesses			1
that is the reason i believe @entity119 will once again struggle at a @entity3			1
@entity119 have some terrific players but their system and strategy are too simplistic to upset the best teams in the world			0
@entity119 enjoy what is more like a boxing match than the chess game that @entity85 and @entity105 will aspire to			1
i ’ve been struck by the publicity that has been given to the ‘ legacy ’ of @entity181 ’s @entity180 , something that looks like being an extremely positive event for the entire nation			2
the @entity180 give us the opportunity to showcase our beautiful country and demonstrate what great hosts we are			0
in addition an infrastructure , which will benefit our children in the coming years , will be left for the nation to enjoy			2
shame : @entity193 and @entity195 star @entity194 may never get to play at a @entity3 what will be @entity20 ’s legacy ? several revamped stadia , some improved local infrastructure and the huge disappointment of being the hosts and not even making the @entity47			1
hosting a @entity3 is a high - risk undertaking for any nation			1
the impact it has on a country is no longer a positive exercise in ‘ cost and benefit ’			0
the process of deciding how and where @entity211 are held must be reviewed			0
the pantomime that is the proposed 2022 @entity214 is further evidence that something fundamental in world football has to change for the sake of the game ’s integrity and to make the finals affordable in the future			0
all that said , the backdrop @entity20 will provide for football ’s showpiece competition will make this the most spectacular @entity3 ever			1
talent : neutrals will be hoping @entity229 can recover from knee surgery to take part in @entity20 new media , improved technology , global communications , the music , the colour and the @entity20 people will make this the greatest show on earth			1
there are very few of the great players who wo n’t be there			2
@entity194 is the prime example			0
like his fellow countryman @entity247 , the @entity246 superstar may never play in the finals			0
the @entity3 finals provide us with the opportunity to see so many great players			1
times have changed though as we see so many of them playing regularly in the @entity255 and in the @entity256			0
@entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity229			0
the list goes on : @entity101 ( love him or hate him ) , @entity265 , @entity266 and so on			0
conspicuous by their absence from my hit list are any @entity271			0
in my book , they come under a separate heading			0
that of @entity3 winners 2014			2
star : @entity276 ( right ) deserves to win the @entity3 for being the best player to have played to game @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283			1
what other squad could have left out @entity285 ? then , of course , they have @entity276 , for me the best player ever to have played the game			2
for that alone , he deserves a @entity3 winner ’s medal			1
they have power , pace , a healthy measure of cynicism in defence and an abundance of attacking options			0
crucially , they have the brilliant @entity276			1
there are others to look out for			0
some less known to us in @entity132			0
players who have the opportunity to make themselves household names			0
look out for @entity162 of @entity163 , @entity307 of @entity308 , @entity310 ’s @entity309 , @entity311 of @entity120 , @entity312 of @entity313 and also @entity314			1
the @entity316 man is one of the less recognisable names in the @entity105 squad but he will anchor the midfield and allow @entity276 the freedom to win the @entity3			1
i ca n’t wait for the show to begin			0
pressure : all eyes will be on @entity258 to see if the @entity20 can inspire his team to @entity3 success			1

@entity20 will provide a brilliant backdrop to the @entity3 but the host nation wo n't win the *summer* tournament
@entity276 deserves to lead @entity105 to @entity3 *victory*
