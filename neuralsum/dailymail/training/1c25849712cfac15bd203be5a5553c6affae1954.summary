it is twice as wide as @entity1 , has more than five miles of corridors , and has one room for every day of the year - and now @entity4 , @entity6 's largest privately owned stately home , has gone on sale for £ 7million			1
former residents include the first @entity9 and the second @entity10 , who later went on to become prime minister			0
the house has featured in several period tv dramas , and plays a prominent role in the film biopic of artist @entity17			0
however , as well as getting their hands on a piece of history , the new owners will also inherit a huge repair bill , thought to be somewhere in the region of £ 42million , to fix subsidence caused by mining in the area and to repair older parts of the building			1
grand : @entity4 is wider than @entity1 , has more than five miles of corridors , and was once visited by @entity31 - and has now gone on sale for £ 7million vast : the property is the largest stately home in private hands , and even has a section dubbed ' the village ' by the @entity39 family who currently own it , because it takes so long to get to historic : the house was originally owned by @entity43 , administrator to @entity44 , and has since been owned by the @entity46 family and the @entity47			1
as well as inheriting a slice of history , the new owners could face a repair bill as high as £ 42million the home is suffering from subsidence after the fourth @entity53 established mines around the home			1
@entity56 continued there until 30 years ago , and the owners say the work has damaged the property the current owners , architect @entity39 and his wife , has been seeking compensation of £ 100million from the @entity64 , but the case has yet to be resolved , according to @entity66			2
after the coal pits were nationalised following the end of the second world war , labour minister for power and energy @entity71 , an outspoken critic of the aristocracy , allowed mining virtually up to the back door			0
the local miners protested , and threatened to go on strike over the poor treatment of the @entity53 family , who owned the home at the time , because of their reputation as a generous employer who built schools , invited villagers to parties in the grounds and paid workers handsomely			1
mr @entity39 , who bought the home for just £ 1.5million along with his three sons in 1999 , has spent £ 5million upgrading the plumbing , electrics and heating , but even that investment has left much more to be done			0
speaking to @entity66 , the family said in a statement : ' we fell in love with @entity4 15 years ago , buying it to save it from neglect and to try and find a sustainable future for this wonderful piece of history			1
' our father is nearly 90 and he does not have the energy he once had ; it is his and our greatest wish to find someone to carry on our work			0
' the most important thing is to see the house in safe hands and secure the preservation of the finest @entity118 interiors in the country for future generations to enjoy			0
' up to date : in modern times the house has made a name for itself as the backdrop to various period dramas , and features as the @entity126 in the new film mr @entity17 action : @entity129 as artist @entity17 films a scene in one of @entity4 's 365 rooms within the 250 acres of grounds are 22 listed buildings			2
the house itself dates back to the 17th century , although little of the original building now remains , having been largely replaced in the 18th century			0
the property was perhaps the largest of the estates in the country at the time of its creation and was home to @entity43 , administrator for @entity44 , who was executed in 1641 for treason and is buried nearby			0
the estate passed to his son and heir , and on his death in 1695 , was inherited by the @entity46 family , who later became the @entity154			0
@entity155 , the second @entity10 , made the home into a @entity158 political stronghold in the mid- 1700s and served as prime minister twice , though died during his second term			0
in 1782 the ownership again changed hands , this time being inherited by the fourth @entity53 who established mines and factories in the surrounding area during the industrial revolution , making the family the sixth richest in the country			2
sprawling : the house and its out - buildings stretch over three acres to themselves , covered by 22 @entity173 listings , and sit in 250 acres of grounds luxurious : the house expanded greatly under the @entity53 family , who rose to became the sixth wealthiest in @entity6 , and at one point employed more than 1,000 people , including a rat catcher and a state bed maker prestigious : @entity155 , the second @entity10 , made the home a @entity158 political stronghold in the mid- 1700s and served as prime minister twice as a sign of their wealth , at one time in 1841 there were more than 1,000 people employed at the house , with jobs including ' rat catcher ' and ' state bed maker ' , with the local village being almost entirely dependent on the house for survival			1
in 1912 , the house was visited by @entity31 and his wife @entity199 , with the royal family taking up a grand total of 76 bedrooms			2
the @entity53 family , along with their magnificent house , were also thought to be the inspiration for @entity206 - otherwise known as mr @entity206 - from @entity208 's @entity207			1
according to legend , guests were once guided back to their rooms using coloured confetti because the property was so large , and the current owners have dubbed one part of it ' the village ' - because it takes so long to get to			1
the house passed into private hands after the death of the tenth @entity53 in 1979			2
since then it has gained fame as a backdrop to tv series including the 1999 show @entity225 , and will feature in the upcoming @entity228 series @entity229			0
@entity4 also stands in for @entity230 's @entity126 in mr @entity17 , the new biopic of @entity17 that won @entity129 a best actor award at @entity233 for his portrayal of the artist			2
crimbling : the current owner , architect @entity39 , bought the house in 1999 with his wife and three sons in order to preserve it - and has spend £ 5million on upgrades , but the new owners could still face a bill for £ 42million after moving in inspirational : the @entity53 family , and @entity4 , were thought to be the inspiration behind @entity206 - otherwise known as mr @entity206 - from @entity208 's @entity207			1

@entity4 has five miles of *hallway* and one part is called ' the village ' because it takes so long to get to
owned by @entity53 family who inspired @entity206 in @entity208 's novel , and @entity31 once stayed here
it is being sold for £ 7million but the new owners could also inherit a £ 42million repair bill *due* to subsidence
