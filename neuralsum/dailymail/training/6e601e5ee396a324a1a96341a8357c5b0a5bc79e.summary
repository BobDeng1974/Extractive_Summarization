former children 's minister @entity4 accused ministers of seeking to ' gain popularity at the expense of children 's lives ' by pushing through a popular but ineffective measure			1
she said : ' i think deliberately to stoke up envy and division between people in order to gain popularity at the expense of children 's lives is immoral			1
it has no good intent			0
speaking out : @entity4 has hit out at plans by @entity21 and the government to cap household benefits at £ 500 - a - week she added : ' there are all sorts of things you have to do when times are tight that have negative consequences but you do them for good purposes			1

@entity4 said that the cap is merely a political device to ' demonstrate whose side you 're on ' rather than a move that will save the government much money			1
she predicted a mass exodus of families from @entity54 who can no longer afford to live there because of the cap but who would struggle to find work in cheaper areas			2
dismissive : a spokesman for @entity61 @entity60 accused @entity4 of hugely misinformed scaremongering she told @entity63 that child protection and education services might struggle to keep track of youngsters whose families are forced to leave @entity54			1

' our reforms bring fairness back to the system while ensuring we support the most vulnerable			0
' @entity85 : @entity4 says that many families may be forced to leave @entity54 as they will be unable to afford to live there under the proposed benefit cap business secretary @entity89 said his party colleague was right to warn of the risks of ' very serious social consequences ' but defended the need for a cap			1

' what is immoral , and i have read her article carefully , is demonising poor people			0
' he told @entity109 's @entity108 : ' we have got to cap the housing benefit element while at the same time increasing the supply of affordable housing			2
' that is absolutely critical because without that you will have very serious social consequences which @entity4 has quite rightly warned about			2
