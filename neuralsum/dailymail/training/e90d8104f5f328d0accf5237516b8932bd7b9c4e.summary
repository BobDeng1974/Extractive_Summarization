by @entity0 for the first time in millennia , the average level of carbon dioxide has topped 400 parts per million for an entire month			0
april ’s carbon dioxide readings come less than a year after scientists warned that the amount of the gas in the @entity11 ’s atmosphere could surpass the 400ppm marker and stay there			1
the gas is considered by many scientists to be responsible for global warming and has consistently breached the mark for a month – likely for the first time in 800,000 years			0
an unfortunate first : for the first time in human history , the average level of carbon dioxide has topped 400 parts per million ( ppm ) for an entire month			0
many scientists think that the burning of fossil fuels and other material ( pictured ) is responsible for global warming climate change is already having an impact on every part of the @entity31 , according to a doom - laden report published by the @entity34 administration earlier this week			1
the third @entity31 national climate assessment says the number and strength of extreme weather events have increased over the past 50 years			0
president @entity34 is set to use the paper to convince the @entity31 public on the need for a crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions			0
the report , compiled by 300 experts and released by the @entity46 , said : ‘ climate change , once considered an issue for a distant future , has moved firmly into the present			0
' more than half the @entity31 population lives in coastal areas that are ‘ increasingly vulnerable ’ to the effects of climate change , the report said			0
and efforts to cut emissions so far are ‘ insufficient to avoid increasingly negative social , environmental , and economic consequences ’ , it concluded			0
april ’s average carbon dioxide reading was 401.33ppm , according to scientists at the @entity61 in @entity62			1
the institution is the custodian of the longest continuous record of carbon dioxide measurements , which were started in the 1950s by @entity68 on the @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity63 reported			2
the ‘ @entity72 ’ measurements are thought to be representative of carbon dioxide levels around the world			2
rising levels of the gas in the atmosphere are thought to be caused by the burning of fossil fuels and are claimed to be responsible for the warming of the planet			1
based on ice core samples from the @entity85 ice sheet that preserve samples of old air , experts from @entity61 said that carbon dioxide levels did not breach 300ppm prior to the industrial revolution for the past 800,000 years			2
@entity11 probably had carbon dioxide levels of 280ppm before the @entity92 experts said , and the reading was 316ppm when the @entity72 began in the 1950s			1
it 's getting hot in here : rising levels of the gas in the atmosphere are thought to be caused by the burning of fossil fuels and are claimed to be responsible for the warming of the planet ( illustrated )			1
the @entity11 probably had carbon dioxide levels of 280ppm before the @entity92 experts said however , while carbon dioxide levels are expected to remain consistently above 400ppm throughout this month , scientists expect them to drop slightly when plants die in autumn			1
it is thought that @entity11 ’s levels will hover above the 400ppm level for good in the next few years .			2

april ’s average carbon dioxide reading was 401.33ppm , according to scientists at the @entity61 in @entity62
@entity111 readings come within a year of scientists warning the amount of the gas in the @entity11 ’s atmosphere could stay beyond 400ppm
@entity11 had carbon dioxide levels of 280ppm before the @entity92
rising levels of the gas in the atmosphere are thought to be caused by the burning of fossil fuels and therefore responsible for global warming
