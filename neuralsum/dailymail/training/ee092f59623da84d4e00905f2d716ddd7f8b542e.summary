by @entity0 @entity1 : 15:53 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:53 est , 18 december 2013 brave : a sketch of @entity5 the parachuting dog who fought in the @entity8 and was decorated for his bravery in action against the @entity11 @entity13 's parachuting dogs of war are honoured in a new book which tells the story of how man 's best friend was enlisted into the ranks of the army to help defeat the @entity11			1
13 - lucky for some : the history of the @entity21 by @entity22 chronicles how these ' paradogs ' became hero - hounds in the service of their country			1
@entity28 was one of them			2
he learned how to sniff out mines , did n't flinch under gunfire and eagerly threw himself out of planes thousands of feet in the air			2
and on d - day , the greatest invasion in history when the @entity38 left the shores of @entity13 to retake occupied @entity40 from the @entity11 , he dropped under heavy ack - ack to be the first four - legged liberator on @entity44 soil			1
after the war the young @entity46 mix was given a medal recognising his ' conspicuous gallantry			2
' he was one of the most unique units ever formed by the @entity13 army in wartime			1
the @entity53 , early in the @entity8 and overwhelmed by the @entity55 war macine , trained dogs with mines on their backs to crawl under @entity60 panzers and sacrifice themselves for the @entity62			1
but @entity13 wanted its canine comrades alive - to find minefields , keep a watchful eye out for the enemy and even to attack sentries			1
@entity22 , an amateur historian , believes the battalion got @entity28 in early 1944 because @entity70 @entity69 ' had a veterinary background			2
' @entity72 initially ran the ' @entity73 ' in @entity74 , a @entity75 for hounds that were meant to help the war effort			2
@entity28 , who was renamed @entity5 by the paras , joined @entity79 and @entity80 , the latter being the only bitch to parachute for the army during the war			2
training was tough , recounts @entity86			2
at the base in @entity89 the dogs were forced to sit four hours on transport aircraft with propellors running at full pitch			1
they learned to sniff out explosives - @entity95 , cordite , ammonal - and how to keep low to the ground when live ammo was flying all around			2
the dogs were fitted with parachutes originally designed to drop bicycles for troops			1
starved of food and drink before jumps , the dogs were lured out of the aircraft with chunks of meat			1
on april 2 , 1944 , @entity69 wrote in his notebook about his first jump with @entity80			0
' after my chute developed , ' he wrote , ' i turned to face the line of flight ; the dog was 30 yards away and slightly above			0
the chute had opened and was oscillating slightly			0
@entity80 looked somewhat bewildered but showed no sign of fear			0
i called out and she immediately turned in my direction and wagged her tail vigorously			0
' the dog touched down 80 feet before i landed			0
she was completely relaxed , making no attempt to anticipate or resist the landing , rolled over once , scrambled to her feet and stood looking round			0
i landed 40 feet from her and immediately ran to her , released her and gave her the feed			0
' hero : lance corporal @entity129 and corporal @entity130 pose next to the life - sized model of @entity5 on d - day , june 6 1944 , three aircraft carrying the @entity135 paras and their three dogs were sent to @entity138			1
@entity5 , who would go on to win a medal , had to be thrown out of the plane by the jump master after @entity69 had jumped			0
he landed in a tree where he hung suspended for two hours before his two - legged comrades rescued him			0
he had cuts to his face from shrapnel from @entity60 mortars			0
but @entity5 and the other dogs went to work and were invaluable in sniffing out mines			1
' they would sniff excitedly over it for a few seconds and then sit down looking back at the handler with a quaint mixture of smugness and expectancy , ' @entity69 wrote , noting that the dogs would then be rewarded with a treat			1
' the dogs also helped on patrols by sniffing out enemy positions and personnel , hence saving many @entity164 lives			1
' @entity79 was severely wounded on @entity137 , while @entity80 was separated from her battalion shortly after landing in @entity138 and never seen again			0
but they were later replaced by two @entity60 army @entity60 shepherds who switched sides			0
@entity5 survived the war and went on to receive the @entity171 , the @entity13 's highest honor for animals that have displayed ' conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving with any branch of the @entity177 or @entity178			1
' when he died in 1955 , the former paradog was buried in a cemetery of honor for animals northeast of @entity183			0
a life - sized model of him can be found in the @entity187 in @entity188 ... wearing his parachute .			0

dogs were trained as bomb sniffers and lookouts for @entity13 troops
they were starved prior to jumps so they could be lured out with meat
