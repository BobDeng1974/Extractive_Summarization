they shuffled away from @entity1 in high good humour			1
they had enjoyed a day of strong ale , fierce sunshine and @entity6			1
there were tales to tell and memories to store			0
in short , it was just like the game @entity13 and @entity14 invented			0
small wonder that every face wore the broadest of beams			0
on such an evening , with so many of the audience in such a mood , it felt vaguely unseemly to harbour doubts about the validity of the event			0
but those doubts were being expressed by those who spent their careers coping with all manner of @entity29 wickets , and their disquiet was unanimous			0
lighting up the day : @entity6 was brilliant despite the poor quality of the wicket for the fact is that the first test of this keenly awaited series has not been a true contest between bat and ball since the first morning			1
the straw - coloured strip on which gifted players are required to perform has proved as dead as @entity42 ’s parrot			2
the fast men have bent their backs and spilled their sweat , but their efforts have proved largely unprofitable			0
@entity48 ’s full - hearted attempts to generate pace and movement from the unrewarding surface have been as futile as @entity53 hitting serves in a paddy field			1
everybody has enjoyed time to play ; so much time that the most accomplished batsmen seemed to be weighing up the alternatives before deciding on an appropriate shot			2
of course , wickets have fallen , since good bowlers possess the skill and spirit to find a way			2
but the odds have been laughably stacked against their best efforts			1
@entity68 , the @entity69 groundsman , got his retaliation in first at the close of the opening day			0
aware that the county might be accused of preparing a pitch to last through five lucrative test match days , he issued a statement of explanation			0
‘ we wanted to produce a pitch with pace , bounce and carry , which has n’t happened unfortunately , ’ he announced			0
partnership : @entity6 and @entity82 also became part of @entity85 's highest ever last wicket stand in a test respect : @entity6 and @entity82 are applauded off at lunch after their inspirational display man of the hour : the @entity1 crowd had one big topic to talk about at the end of the day it was a memorable piece of understatement which apparently produced dark chuckles in the @entity85 dressing room			1
@entity99 , bounce and carry were conspicuous non-starters			0
the result was that nicks failed to carry , honest endeavour went miserably unrewarded and the draw seemed depressingly predestined			0
none of which detracts in the slightest from yesterday ’s contribution from @entity6			1
for the cricket lover , few things can match the sight of a tail - ender bravely prospering , defying the probabilities , rising far beyond his status			1
@entity6 answered all these demands in his riotous alliance with @entity82			1
a wonderful air of unreality hung over proceedings as an @entity85 team which once had scuffled to avoid the follow - on marched on to a first innings lead			0
at one stage , it seemed roughly as plausible a prospect as @entity127 scoring seven against @entity128			0
but with @entity6 contriving to bat like @entity131 , the fantasy was duly delivered			1
a game which relishes records celebrated the onslaught of startling statistics as @entity6 and @entity82 laid about them			1
having broken heart and back in the @entity139 innings , @entity6 relished the chance of answering in kind			1
the most entrancing of cricket grounds came thrillingly to life as @entity6 played his shots ; each cut , drive and glance detonating explosions of approval			1
whether he would have found the time to flourish such vibrant strokes on a more challenging surface was a question which did not detain the @entity1 clientele			2
brothers in arm : the brilliant partnership of @entity82 and @entity6 was a big highlight naturally , there were regrets : that @entity6 did not reach the hundred for which the whole of @entity162 was yearning ; that the stand — during which both batsmen had declined a steady stream of singles — fell just two short of the double - century			1
but these were the merest quibbles in the face of such enjoyment			0
there was even the threat of robust altercation , when @entity175 came marching , jabbing , bawling down the pitch after his appeal for a catch off @entity82 was rejected			2
in truth , there is something rather undignified in a fast bowler losing his rag when the last - wicket stand is surging towards 200 ; still more when the replay reveals that the batsman missed the ball by a country mile			2
in any event , @entity6 was equal to the occasion , striding down the wicket and guiding young @entity82 away from hostilities , clearly anxious that his dream innings should not be disrupted			1
up in the radio commentary box , the sage of the @entity195 was running out of insults to describe the 22 - yard strip of straw			0
‘ you know what this pitch would be good for ? ’ asked @entity200			2
like that one they had in @entity206 before the war			0
lasted 10 days , did n’t it ? this is the pitch for that			0
’ the thought occurred that @entity200 might have been in his element in such a test match , but it was swiftly banished			1
for , despite all the misgivings , this was a strangely compelling day of test cricket			1
yet we knew , beyond decent doubt , that it might have been so much better			0
fire power : @entity6 hits another great shot mid-way through his impressive display			2

the quality of the wicket at @entity1 has been *troublesome* for pace
the odds have been stacked in the *favour* of batsmen over bowlers
but @entity6 's riotous alliance with @entity82 improved the day
it was a shame not to see him reach the 100 mark
@entity200 was big on *criticism* of the wicket
it remained a compelling day of test cricket - but it could have been better
