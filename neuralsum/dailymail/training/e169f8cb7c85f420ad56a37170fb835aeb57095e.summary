@entity1 @entity0 has come under fire for comparing parents on the school run to ' wailing , hissing feral cats ambitious parents might think their educational problems are over when they secure a coveted place at a sought - after school			1
but it turns out that bagging a parking spot near the school gates can be every bit as competitive			1
according to one community policeman the fight for a space makes some parents harder to deal with than ‘ wailing , hissing feral cats ’			1
@entity0 says they indulge in a ‘ vicious game of cat and mouse ’ as they try to avoid a parking ticket – even at the cost of blocking driveways			1
in desperation , the police community support officer used an official email to beg school - run drivers to behave themselves in @entity31 , @entity32			1
mr @entity0 , a former @entity33 inspector , wrote : ‘ when challenged , the parent will become an angry creature , wailing and hissing their annoyance at being challenged over their dangerous parking			1
‘ the parent stares out from their metal box , with a look of pure hate			2
a look upon their face saying , “ i would splat you with one swipe of my paw ( if it was not illegal ) ”			0
never mind the moggies , it is the mothers who bare their claws these days			1
’ mr @entity0 reminded parents that officers patrolled near schools to prevent accidents and said parking on double yellow lines was likely to result in a ticket			1
it is not known which school he was referring to but residents confirmed his beat covers @entity66 primary school			2
one woman , who has an 11 - year - old daughter at the school and lives along the same road , said mr @entity0 ’s remarks were justified			1
she added : ‘ this road is completely chaotic			0
everyone is trying to park down roads with no parking spaces			1
i ca n’t even park outside my own house			2
‘ we ’ve had countless texts from the headmaster reminding people to park appropriately			2
but parents just ignore it			2
‘ i know there ’s bickering and fighting going on between the women – it ’s all very unsafe			0
they are so focused on getting a space they stop watching the kids and i think one day a child will be hit			0
’ @entity91 , 70 , a retired college lecturer who lives by the school , said : ‘ it ’s all these well - to - do mothers in their posh white @entity95 who are doing it			1
' they have these huge great cars they do n’t need and their attitude is “ so what ? i ’m only here for two minutes ”			0
he wrote on an online messaging forum saying that catching parents parking illegally outside some schools was like a game of ' cat and mouse ' ‘ they ’re very slick and clever and they ’re very self - assured			1
they are stealthy and will do anything to avoid getting a ticket			0
‘ they know they ’re being inconsiderate but they think they are superior			0
the ones that go to work are always in a hurry and always pushy			0
’ another resident , 31 - year - old @entity123 , said : ‘ there is a lot of aggression from the mums			0
they fight for spaces and i think what the @entity130 said is truthful			0
’ @entity132 , campaigns officer for @entity133 , the road safety charity , said illegal parking around schools presented a serious danger to children who can emerge from between stationary cars			2
he added : ‘ we would urge all parents to be part of the solution , not part of the problem , by considering how their children can get to school other than by car , or if they have to drive , then by sticking to 20mph or below wherever there may be vulnerable people on foot or bike			1
’ a near - miss accident last march involving a child at a @entity31 school prompted police to target parents who park dangerously			1
@entity158 , 37 , whose sons attend @entity31 community primary , said : ‘ the response is perhaps a bit over the top but there is certainly a problem with space			0
‘ there ’s just not enough places for people to park and so people park illegally and compete for spaces			1
’ other parents said the parking problem was made worse by schools being overcrowded			1
the @entity1 ( not pictured ) said when parents are challenged they become ' an angry creature , wailing and hissing their annoyance ' ' when i worked for the @entity33 one of the most frequently asked questions i was asked was , ' what is the most dangerous animals you have had to deal with ' a @entity184 ! a @entity185 , a bull , a horse !			1
when i told them it was with out a doubt a cat , they would look very disappointed			2
a cat , what one of those cute , cuddly , purring softies ? ? ' but if the situation is right ! ! i would then tell them of my personal experiences of trying to catch an injured cat , usually a feral one and how crazy they would react			2
a feral cat would climb a wall , run along the ceiling ( almost ) , screaming and wailing like the most terrifying creature from a horror movie			1
it would take me all my strength and cunning to get hold of the ferocious feline on the end of my @entity212 , and place it into a pet carrier			0
' all i wanted was to get the injured animal to a vet to have its paw seen too			0
the captured mog would stare out of its cage , with a look of pure hate , thinking to itself if i was bigger i would splat you with one swipe of my paw			0
vets certainly earn their money			0
' these days i no longer deal with such incidents			0
now take a parent , they are normally cute , purring , very pleasant , easy going , they might even engage in a little chat			0
but if the situation is right ! ! such as @entity235 ! ! ! ! ' a game of cat and mouse unfolds , the parent ( not all ) will pretend they have not seen you , as they park their car on double yellow lines , once parked the charade will continue , even if you stand next to the car , hoping your presence will resolve the situation			1
' when challenged , the parent will be become an angry creature , wailing and hissing their annoyance at being challenged over their dangerous parking			1
it will take me all my strength to remain calm , as the parent stares out from their metal box , with a look of pure hate			0
a look upon their face saying , i would splat you with one swipe of my paw ! ( if it was not illegal ) ' never mind the @entity265 , it is the mothers who bare their claws these days			1
' i read a article in a paper recently where a mother had been knocked down by another parent , outside a school , and was in a serious situation in hospital			2
some of you may have seen it yourself			0
it was a rather sobering read , and goes to show how things can go very wrong , over such a simple day to day event			0
' when your local @entity1 is at your school , please remember we are there to prevent accidents			1
accidents that might involve a child , ( or parent ) and no one wants that			0
if you can walk , please do			0
if you have to drive , and i know many of you do , please allow time to get to your school and park safely			1
if you should park on a yellow line , and get a ticket , please do n't climb the wall ! the lines are there for safety reasons , nothing else			2
' i do not have a @entity212 these days , only a ticket book			0
and if there is no illegal parking , it stays in my pocket			2
and that gives us all a good feline			0
