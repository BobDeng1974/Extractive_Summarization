a warrior beetle lived up to its name when it was recorded dispatching a devil scorpion with little effort			2
a man placed the two creatures into a container to show what happens they face off , warning viewers that the invertebrate would feed on its natural prey			0
after feeling out their environment , the combatants lock horns in battle to the death			0
the competitors begin by feeling out their environments before they approach each other and lock horns sensing its predator the scorpion turns and tries to make a run for it			0
but the beetle steamrolls forward and is undeterred by its competitor ’s sting			0
it dives at the scorpion 's tail and clamps on with its powerful pincers			1
after coming face - to - face with the beetle , the scorpion tries to get away but its competitor clamps down on its tail the scorpion attempts to get away by running over the piece of wood but the beetle holds it in place with its huge pincers chasing the scorpion around the container , the beetle maintains its grip on the tail and hangs from it as its competitor attempts to make a getaway			1
despite the scorpion turning and attempting to fend off the beetle on a number of occasions , the outcome is inevitable and eventually it starts to slow down			0
releasing the tail – now bent and crooked – the beetle jumps on the scorpion ’s right pincer before returning to the tail and chopping it in half			2
dispatched : the beetle leaves the scene of the crime after chopping the scorpion in half with its pincers according to the video 's creator , warrior beetles , known scientifically as @entity66 , eat devil scorpions in the wild			2
both are inhabitants of the @entity72 of the @entity73 , and the devil scorpion is considered a pest species in @entity76 as it often enters homes and stings the occupants			1
despite its nasty sting however , the beetle ’s strong armour is impervious to it .			1

the beetle *latched* onto and *snipped* off the scorpion 's tail
both inhabit the @entity72 of the @entity73
