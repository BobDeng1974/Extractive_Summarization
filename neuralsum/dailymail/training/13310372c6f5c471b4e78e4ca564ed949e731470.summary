a @entity1 project could soon offer anyone with € 200,000 the opportunity to soar over 100 km into space			0
@entity5 has announced plans to test its prototype spaceplane at an altitude of 10,000 feet ( 3,048 metres ) over @entity9 in may			1
if successful , a second unpowered drop test from 100,000 feet ( 30,480 metres ) should follow next year , according to officials			2
if successful , a second unpowered drop test from 100,000 feet ( 30,480 metres ) should follow for almost a decade @entity5 has been working on a vehicle able to carry four passengers up to an altitude of 100km into space			1
the business jet - sized spaceplane will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport runway using its jet engines , according to a report in @entity25			1
at an altitude of about 12km , the rocket engine will be ignited and in only 80 seconds the craft will climb to 60km altitude			1
the rocket propulsion system will then be shut down as the plane ’s inertia carries it on to over 100km , enabling passengers to hover weightlessly			1
for almost a decade @entity5 has been working on a vehicle able to carry four passengers up to an altitude of 100km into space			1
pictured is an interior view of the spaceplane @entity42 's @entity41 aircraft , designed for space tourism , completing its third rocket - powered test in january			1
the test at @entity47 and and @entity48 in @entity49 was meant to simulate a flight into outer - space that will go into effect later this year			1
@entity42 eventually wants to host commercial space tours			2
not only did @entity42 have a successful third test of the aircraft but they reached an altitude of 71,000 feet			2
the flight prior to this test reached 69,000 feet			2
celebrities have already started signing up for the exclusive space tours ready to take off later this year			0
@entity62 and @entity63 have already signed up			0
tickets cost $ 250,000 ( £ 150,500 )			0
chief executive @entity65 has promised to take a seat on the ship 's first flight			0
the vehicle would then use a cold gas reaction control system jets to position itself for atmospheric re-entry			1
after slowing down during descent , the jet engines will be restarted for a normal landing at the airfield			1
according to the company , the entire trip will last two hours			0
operators using the spaceplane could offer safe space flight for a price per passenger of around € 200,000 ( £ 120,000 )			2
such a vehicle operating at altitudes between those of conventional aircraft ( 20km ) and those of satellites ( 200km ) could be used for various other applications			0
the company claims it could be a precursor for rapid ‘ point - to - point ’ transport vehicles or quick access to space – opening up previously unexplored territory			0
the model being tested in may is 15 feet ( 4.6 metres ) long and only a quarter of the size of the actual space plane			0
it will be dropped by a helicopter and remotely controlled for a sea landing east of @entity9 in the @entity103			2
‘ what we are looking for is to validate the spaceplane itself , and the spaceplane itself is in a gliding mode , ’ @entity104 , spaceplane programs manager told @entity25			0
engineers are currently fitting the avionics and flight control systems to the quarter - scale prototype ahead of the @entity118 company has n't given an indication of when the spaceplane will be ready for flight			1
@entity122 is n't the only company working on a suborbital space plane			0
@entity42 and @entity125 , could be flying their own vehicles in the near future			0
engineers are fitting the avionics and flight control systems to the quarter - scale prototype ahead of the test			1

*astrium* plans to test its spaceplane at 10,000 ft ( 3,048 m ) over @entity9
prototype could lead to the *development* of a business jet - sized vehicle
eventually hope is to use rocket engines to let *spacecraft* climb to 60km
the rocket propulsion system will then be shut down as the plane ’s inertia carries it on to over 100km , enabling passengers to hover weightlessly
