the 28 - year - old woman used a red permanent marker pen to scrawl ' @entity13 ' in three - inch high letters on @entity16 ’s 1830 masterpiece @entity15 - which dramatically depicts a bare - breasted woman raising the @entity4 flag against oppression			1
@entity13 is the name of a website calling for an independent inquiry into the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the @entity25 and @entity27 ’s @entity26			1
@entity28 ( centre ) , director of the paintings department at the @entity32 , and @entity33 ( left ) , director of the @entity35 , speak to the media the woman was immediately grabbed by security guards after she wrote on the painting on thursday evening , and remained in custody on friday			1
a specialist restorer was rushed to the scene and the @entity8 believes that the inscription can be removed			2

there are dozens of conspiracy theories claiming to explain the ' truth ' behind the attacks floating around cyberspace , some of which are more believable than others			1
proponents of these theories claim there are inconsistencies in the official government conclusions , or evidence which was allegedly ' overlooked			0
' a 2008 global poll of 16,063 people in 17 countries , 15 % of those who responded said they believed the @entity92 government was responsible while seven per cent even claimed @entity93 was the culprit			0
one of the most prominent conspiracy theories among self - proclaimed ' truthers ' is that the @entity26 and number 7 @entity26 were destroyed in a controlled demolition rather than as a result of the impact of the two aircraft and resultant fire			1
others apparently believe the @entity25 was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the @entity92			0
some also claim the authorities had pryer warning of the terrorist attacks but deliberately failed to act on them , or even assisted the attackers			1
critics claim the theories are simply a common , and misguided , response among sections of society to a traumatic global event			0

it was an act of love , i was n’t thinking			0
i thought the artist would understand			0
' and in 2006 , pensioner @entity145 smashed a porcelain urinal - a modern ‘ artwork ’ by @entity148 - with a hammer			2
he told a court in @entity125 : ' i am not the cheap vandal that some would have me to be			0
