former @entity3 light - middleweight champion @entity0 is recovering slowly from being shot in the leg the retired boxer ( right ) has vowed to complete next year 's @entity1 despite his lack of mobility but @entity0 insists nothing will stop him completing the @entity19 's famous half - marathon for kids ' @entity21 charity @entity24 's next step , of which he is a patron , next september – no matter how long it takes or how much it hurts him			1
the married dad - of - two told @entity29 's @entity28 : ' i am making good progress , but it is a long old road , a painstaking process			1
' i think people see me up and around they think i am back to normal			2
i am nowhere near that			2
' nerves rehabilitate at roughly one millimetre a day			0
my nerve damages travels from my knee to the tops of my toes – so you 're probably talking 12 to 18 months before i am back anywhere near where i was			0
@entity0 will race for @entity24 's @entity42 , which supports sufferers of neuroblastoma , a rare form of cancer ' although i can get around and do some stuff , walking is a struggle			1
i can walk slowly with a foot brace on but it is painful , an effort			0
' i have to intentionally force my left leg to move			2
every step i take on my left foot is a conscious effort			2
for me to walk 100 metres is a real effort			0
' but i will definitely complete the @entity1			1
' even if i do n't get any better than i am now , i will be doing it			0
even if i have to walk 13 miles , i will do it			0
' even if i have to force my left leg to walk every step , i will do it because i am stubborn like that			1
there is nothing that can stop me			2
@entity0 pictured here in his boxing pomp - on the left in 2003 and on the right in 2007 after winning the @entity69 light - middleweight title bout ' my goal will be to do it for the kids at @entity24 's @entity42			1
a lot of young children get @entity21 and it is a horrible , aggressive form of cancer			2
' these kids go through hell trying to get rid of it and going though chemotherapy			0
that will be my driving force			0
' so firstly , the aim is to get myself right physically and to the point where i can do it , and when it is hurting and getting difficult my driving force will be to do it for the kids who have @entity21 to give them maybe a better life before their lives are taken away , or to give them a better rehabilitation			2
' to give an idea of how difficult @entity0 still finds walking , he was left in agony when he agreed to take his nine - year - old son @entity93 in @entity94 last weekend			1
the 35 - year - old says nothing will stop him competing in the famous @entity1 next year he recalled : ' i was working in the corner for @entity99 's fight , and my son had never been to @entity94 before			1
' he said , " will you take me for a walk around @entity94 ? " for me to walk 100 metres is a real effort , but i will do anything for him			0
' so i took him on the @entity105 , into @entity106 , and it absolutely killed me			0
' it was so painful but i wanted to do it for him			0
it did n't matter how much pain i was in			0
' people think i am better than i actually am , but i am far from better and it is going to take a long , long while			0
