@entity2 is the last main suspect in the october 12 , 2002 @entity6 resort island attacks that killed 202 people , including 88 @entity28 and seven @entity29			1

plea : an emotional speech by @entity2 at a previous hearing saw him apologise to the bombing 's victims there have been several attacks targeting @entity76 hotels , restaurants and an embassy since then			2
but all have been far less deadly , thanks in part , security experts say , to a relentless crackdown on @entity13 that has largely decimated their ranks			0
@entity2 , who was arrested in @entity85 just over a year ago , told the court the @entity6 bombings were in theory meant to avenge @entity76 policies in the @entity91 territories			1
' from my point of view , it was total failure , ' the suspect earlier said , adding he saw ' no connection ' between the original mission , fighting against the oppression of fellow @entity101 , and the target , partying tourists			0
' yes , most of the victims were white , but there were no @entity107 , ' he said			0
