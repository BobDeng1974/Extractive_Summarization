sir @entity0 argued power blackouts are the ' best possible ' thing for the country one of @entity5 ’s most senior advisers sparked fury yesterday by saying that power blackouts would be good for the country			1
sir @entity0 argued that the blackouts would be the ‘ best possible thing ’ because they would bring home the scale of the energy crisis facing the country			1
sir @entity0 ’s inflammatory remarks – which coincided with forecasts of the first @entity19 blast of the winter – revived the fierce debate over energy prices and supplies which was triggered by mr @entity5 ’s party conference pledge in october to freeze gas and electricity bills			1
the conservatives immediately lept on sir @entity0 ’s comments , claiming that blackouts would be an indictment of mr @entity5 ’s failure to plan for the future when he was energy secretary			1
sir @entity0 , who is advising @entity33 on the future of the country ’s long - term infrastructure needs , said : ‘ in harsh political terms [ blackouts ] would be the best possible thing because this country is extremely good in a crisis			2
’ in the interview with construction industry @entity43 , he added that the @entity44 was nearing the crisis because too little was being done to replace ageing coal - fired and nuclear power stations			0
he said : ‘ we are down to ( just a ) 4 per cent ( surplus of energy capacity ) because we ’ve gone slower than we should have done on nuclear			0
’ his remarks are particularly controversial because of the continuing fury within the energy industry over mr @entity5 ’s plans for an energy price freeze			0
energy bosses said that his move would threaten the security of supply and mean ‘ the lights would go out ’			0
the comments have revived the debate surrounding @entity33 leader @entity5 's promise to freeze gas and electricity bills @entity67 mp @entity66 said : ‘ @entity33 had 13 years to take the long - term decisions to meet @entity44 ’s energy needs , including when @entity5 was energy secretary , but failed to do so			0
' instead they took short - term decisions			0
and now @entity33 ’s key economic adviser thinks it would be a good thing for families , vulnerable older people , and even hospitals treating patients to suffer power cuts			2
’ last night , energy minister @entity79 said : ‘ this is utter madness , but if sir @entity0 thinks power cuts will be a good thing for @entity44 then he is certainly working for the right man – because @entity5 would deliver them			1

senior adviser said blackouts would bring home scale of energy crisis
sir @entity0 argued power cuts would be ' best possible thing '
