the confronting vision reveals shearers stamping on the heads and necks of sheep when the animals appeared to panic and also throwing the sheep around and slamming their heads and bodies against hard wooden floors			1
' ‘ an emotional response without full investigation , including why it has taken so long for @entity2 to release the footage , does not result in better husbandry practices , ’ he said			1
‘ it just reinforces the belief that @entity2 is an extremist group that wants to end livestock production and to irreparably damage the economy and the reputation of @entity42 farmers			2
’ ‘ otherwise it can be seen as not so much an attempt to end the cruelty , but rather another mechanism to attack rural industry in @entity14 , ’ he said			2
he also questioned the authority the group had to film on private property			0
the minister is working with the states on controversial ‘ ag - gag ’ laws to stop activists from placing cameras in factory farms in the hope of exposing animal welfare breaches			2

' woolgrowers condemn this treatment of animals ; we ’re not in the business of treating animals like that and nor are shearers			0

following this , the @entity42 government were forced to put in place stronger safeguards to ensure the well being of all animals leaving @entity14 , but animal rights groups argue the situation has not improved			1
following the more recent footage released on thursday , the @entity2 investigators claim farmers put tight rings on some lambs ' scrotums with anaesthetics to castrate them , but when that failed shearers would just cut off their testicles with shears			1
the animals were also deprived of food and water before being sheared so they were too weak to fight , they claim			0
