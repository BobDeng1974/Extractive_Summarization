by @entity0 for @entity1 influx : sir @entity3 says police are preparing for extremists who could return if they start losing in @entity6 and @entity7 hundreds of @entity11 extremists could return to the @entity11 if jihadist groups start losing battles in @entity6 and @entity7 , the country ’s most senior police officer has warned			1
@entity14 chief sir @entity3 said it can not be predicted when potential terrorists might decide to return home , but police are preparing in case of an influx			1
it is estimated that around 500 @entity11 have travelled to @entity7 to fight alongside extremists , half of whom are thought to be from @entity24			1
sir @entity3 said there are ' a significant number of people who run the risk of being radicalised , militarised and potentially desensitised to violence , who one day we assume will come home '			1
he added : ' the biggest concern certainly i have is that none of us know which way those wars are going to go			0
we ’ve seen some quite radical movements across whole countries			0
look at @entity6 , the shift in a few days			1
these world events were moving at pace			0
' that was obviously @entity46 who were progressing positively			0
if there were to be a reverse of that at pace , and they were to lose , there is a risk that hundreds of people would want to come home			2
that ’s the biggest challenge			0
' we ca n’t predict when it might happen			0
should there be large numbers returning it puts great pressure on all of us to make sure that we are kept safe			0
' while they are there they are not an immediate threat , but should they come back , and should they come back together , that ’s a concern			0
we are trying our best to prepare for that			0
no one should underestimate the task			0
