by @entity0 published : 05:44 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 06:21 est , 22 november 2013 the phenomenon of ‘ lunchtime beauty ’ , which sees time pressured women eager to squeeze in as many treatments as possible into their hour break , shows no signs of abating			0
while most of us make do with popping to the salon round the corner , who will do a mini mani - pedi simultaneously , some women can afford some seriously luxe high - speed beautifying			2
meeting this demand for indulgent all - in - one salon sessions is the @entity21 salon in @entity22 , where women can enjoy a mani , pedi , foot massage , full head of highlights , cut and blow dry , gourmet lunch and champagne , for an eye - watering £ 1,200			1
the salon in @entity22 where you can can get a deluxe express make - over , if you have a spare £ 1,200 set in the heart of ultra-posh @entity22 the studio screams ' place to be seen ' all this pampering requires two hours , and while many may take this an opportunity to sit back and enjoy a little ‘ me time ’ , those who ca n’t leave the office behind need n’t fret			1
customers are provided with wifi , @entity42 chargers and even their own @entity43 as the various beauticians scurry around them			1
the @entity43 , who usually acts as @entity21 's assistant , is made available to clients who have opted for the bespoke express service to run errands and organise any appointments they want			1
of course , one of the main attractions of the package – and part of its extreme price tag - is getting your hair done by salon owner and celebrity hairdresser @entity21 himself			1
for those willing to cough up £ 1,200 @entity21 will personally colour their hair having appeared as an expert on numerous television shows , @entity21 also quaffs the hair of celebrity clients such as @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
the salon itself is no doubt also part of the £ 1,200 cost			1
set in the heart of ultra-posh @entity22 , the studio screams ‘ place to be seen ’			0
it is also is super eco-friendly , aiming to to be the first in the @entity84 to have a carbon - neutral footprint within 12 months of opening by using clever recycling and organic products			0
and forget a lukewarm cappuccino with a mini chocolate , this salon session includes a lunch by world - renowned restaurant @entity93			2
while the haircut and blow - dry gets underway , customers can tuck into to such gastronomic delights as salt - crusted fish with @entity101 salad , fettuccine with fresh seafood and a green harissa dressing or veal , olive and pancetta stew with roasted red pepper			2
for pudding , choose between mouth - watering delights such as honey and apricot trifle with walnuts and lavender and sweet and salty cheesecake with cherries and crumble			0
the salon says of their new service : ' the bespoke service is for the high - powered businesswomen whose time is of great value but who also wants and needs to utilise every working minute while maintaining her appearance			0
while the haircut and blow - dry gets underway , customers can tuck into to gastronomic delights by @entity93 ' as with all colour treatments , clients can be in the chair for up to four hours , waiting for their colour to process , working away on their i - pads , willing the time to pass so they can get back to their desks			2
' now , for the first time in any salon in the @entity84 , @entity21 is offering a double - colourist service whereby @entity21 and his senior protégé , @entity138 , will work on the same head of hair to ensure an expert service in over half the time			1
' @entity21 says : ' i ’ve realised over the years that many of my powerful ceo clients that time is money			0
four hours out of a working day is not commercially viable and down time on a saturday and sunday is valuable time for these career women - they value and cherish time with their children and family so spending four hours in the salon is time they have			0
' one of my clients had asked me if there is any concept that i could think of that would help them fast track this time - consuming appointment so i created this method and technique so they could maximise on their visit at the salon , getting the most productive results whilst not compromising on valuable office time in their working day			0
