many women who juggle career and travel plans fear ' leaving it too late ' to have a baby			0
but one professor has dismissed the theory that once women pass 30 they will immediately begin to suffer fertility problems			0
psychologist @entity10 has controversially claimed that there 's not really a difference between trying to get pregnant in your late twenties and your late thirties			1
psychologist @entity10 has controversially claimed that there 's not really a difference between trying to get pregnant in your late twenties and your late thirties the @entity21 professor has refuted statistics that claim there is a significant difference in the odds of getting pregnant in your late twenties			1
prof @entity10 claims that many women are reading statistics based on outdated records , taken from a time before antibiotics , electricity and advanced medical treatment were in use and the quality of life was much lower			1
the professor has dismissed statistics that claim there is a significant difference in the odds of getting pregnant in your late twenties writing in the @entity40 , the author - who has written the book ' the impatient women 's guide to getting pregnant ' - says that she too feared she would be left childless as she had not tried for a baby and had passed 30			1
she said : ' most books and websites i read said that one in three women ages 35 to 39 would not get pregnant within a year of starting to try			1
' the first page of the @entity53 's ( @entity53 ) 2003 guide for patients noted that women in their late 30s had a 30 per cent chance of remaining childless altogether			0
' the guide also included statistics that i ’d seen repeated in many other places : a woman ’s chance of pregnancy was 20 percent each month at age 30 , dwindling to five per cent by age 40			2
' every time i read these statistics , my stomach dropped like a stone , heavy and foreboding			2
' she counsels that there is a just a marginal difference between falling pregnant at 27 and 39 - despite what the majority of websites and books say			1
instead , she says that some statistics widely touted today are actually based on data from @entity79 birth records from 1670 to 1830			1
she also rubbishes the widely cited statistic that one in three women ages 35 to 39 will not be pregnant after a year of trying , which is based on a 2004 article in the @entity84 journal , which used the historical record as its source			1
she says that women are now basing their pregnancy plans on these antiquated reports , and should focus on modern studies , that show a more encouraging outlook when it comes to getting pregnant			2
she rubbished the widely cited statistic that one in three women ages 35 to 39 will not be pregnant after a year of trying she said a 2004 study in @entity94 studied the chances of pregnancy among 770 @entity98 women , and found positive results			1
the study , led by @entity101 , discovered that of the subjects who had sex at least twice a week , 82 per cent of 35 - to - 39 - year - old women conceived within a year , compared with 86 per cent of 27 - to - 34 - year - olds			1
this showed that the fertility rates of women in their late 20s and early 30s was almost identical - which will bring considerable relief to worried women who fear that their chasing other priorities has wiped their chances of motherhood			0
the author seeks to calm the panic many women feel , using herself as an example - she had three children and all after the age of 35			0
she says fertility problems are not solely based on a woman 's age , and points to endometriosis and blocked fallopian tubes for causing difficulties in conceiving			2
but her comments have been met with criticism from other experts , who insist that age does significantly affect fertility			0
lord @entity134 , the @entity136 reports , claims that medical data collated over 20 years shows a definite decline in fertility with age and , while warning doctors from urging women to have children at a young age , says that there is good evidence of a decline with age			2
the newspaper also reported that consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist @entity151 said that generally , women 's fertility rates began to slip at 31 , dropped at age 37 and sharply fell after age 41			0
but despite prof @entity157 's reassurances , it would seem that the statistics have had a lasting impact on women 's views of motherhood			0
according to a new survey , nearly 70 per cent of @entity165 women think a woman having a baby in her forties is too old - with the most critical being the older generation			0
of those surveyed , over three quarters aged 55 and over were against woman having a baby in their fifth decade			0
the survey , undertaken by @entity178 on behalf of @entity180 test , appears to show a deep - rooted discomfort with women who delay motherhood until their fifth decade .			0
