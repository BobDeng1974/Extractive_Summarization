by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 11:07 est , 31 may 2012 controversial : @entity2 member @entity1 , has boasted about his prowess with a gun alongside images of squirrels , rabbits and birds on his blog a @entity2 member who supports the @entity11 has been branded a hypocrite after he went on a killing spree which included a bird , rabbits and squirrels			1
@entity1 , who stood to be a councillor in @entity18 , has been displaying the bodies of animals he shot in his garden on his personal blog			1
proudly , on the same page , he also says he supports the @entity24 for the @entity25 , despite admitting shooting dead a @entity26			2
his blog entries shows on the same day in may 2011 he also shot a squirrel , and a month later killed two more			1
he also killed , skinned and ate several rabbits			2
and wildlife lovers say it ’s not something they expect from a green campaigner			1
former @entity18 councillor @entity35 condemned mr @entity1			1
she said : ' not only does @entity1 clearly enjoy taking his gun into his garden to shoot squirrels and birds but he actually takes pictures and posts them on his blog			1
' he goes on to describe the dead animals in very poetic and flowery terms			2
he ’s clearly proud of his prowess with the gun			0
' mr @entity1 a former curator at the @entity46 from 1970 to 2004 and now an honorary research fellow there , has defended his position			1
he said : ' in deference to the sensitivities of some lovers of wildlife , i have removed my blog from the @entity55 , ' he said			1
dead : mr @entity57 put up this picture showing a rabbit he had skinned ' i think i ’m right in saying @entity26 considered a pest and grey squirrels are widely considered a menace to forestry			1
' the @entity64 , of which i ’m a member , sees the grey squirrel as public enemy number one			2
' mr @entity1 did n’t think his actions were at odds with his image as an environmentalist			1
' i think anyone who ’s seriously interested in the countryside would share my view of the grey squirrel , ' he said			2
questionable : a rabbit is left hanging by the legs in his garage after it was shot and killed however , mr @entity1 did confess to feeling ashamed after shooting a jackdaw			1
he said : ' i looked at it and it was a beautiful creature , but i had checked with the @entity11 to see if it ’s classified as a pest			0
' mr @entity1 also dismissed mrs @entity35 ’s claims that he was proud of his marksmanship			1
' that ’s complete nonsense , ' he said			0
' if you ’re going to kill a rabbit you want to be as good a shot as you can be			1
' you do n’t want the rabbit to crawl away wounded and in pain			2
' he went on : ' as regards rabbits , i shot a small number for the table and one because it was dying a horrible death from myxomatosis			0
although our household is mostly vegetarian , we do eat meat occasionally			0
' a number of people feel that if you are prepared to eat meat you should be prepared to face up to the consequences			0
' thus i skinned and butchered the rabbits myself			0
after shooting and eating six or eight rabbits over a two year period , myxomatosis returned and decimated the rabbit population			0
now their numbers are building up again i ’m glad to say , because i like seeing them in the garden			0
i have not shot any since the disease returned			0
' victims : a squirrel and a jackdaw lay dead on the grass in another photo from the blog the @entity2 has today distanced itself from the case saying it ' does not support or condone the actions taken by @entity1			1
' there are non-lethal ways of removing so called pests and @entity1 fully intends to use these measures in future			2
we understand that the rabbits were for the table bar one which was put out of its misery from myxomatosis , ' a spokesman said			0
@entity134 , founder of the @entity135 , said as far as her organisation was concerned all creatures should be entitled to freedom and treated with compassion			0
she said : ' unfortunately if he ’s doing it with the correct calibre rifle and no suffering is caused then he ’s not doing anything illegal but personally i find it very sad			0
' an @entity148 spokesman added : ' wherever possible the @entity148 would always prefer alternative solutions and only if there is a serious problem and alternative means are ineffective or impractical should killing be contemplated			0
' in this case control should be carried out legally , precisely targeted and carried out by the most humane method available in the circumstances			0

@entity1 , who stood to be a councillor in @entity18 , put *graphic* kill - pictures on his blog
one shows a rabbit that appears to have been skinned with some *scissors*
another shows a squirrel and a jackdaw lying dead on the grass
' in deference to the sensitivities of some lovers of wildlife , i have removed my blog from the @entity55 , ' he said
