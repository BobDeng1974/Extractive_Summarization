' qualifying for the @entity18 will be difficult , but we will try our best			0

the @entity21 boss was angered by referee @entity70 's decision not to award the his side a second half penalty after @entity30 bundled over @entity57 in the 70th minute			1
' @entity30 was over aggressive in the box , ' insisted @entity68			0

@entity21 's @entity117 ( right ) controls posession under pressure from @entity19 defender @entity31 eagles forward @entity55 makes a run as @entity122 midfielder @entity34 ( left ) gives chase at @entity124 perhaps the @entity21 manager , who was without skipper @entity126 , who on tuesday accepted a four match suspension for elbowing @entity128 on saturday , was trying to mask his disappointment at leaving the south coast with nothing when they could easily have left with all three points			1
the fact @entity21 players hardly appealed for a spot - kick tells its own story			2
@entity19 enjoyed the upper hand during the opening exchanges , @entity140 fashioning the first chance , controlling @entity33 's mishit shot only to fire over the bar in the 11th minute			1
but despite their dominance in terms of possession , this looked a @entity19 side void of invention in the final third			1
even 25 minutes into the game , you could sense the anxiety from home supporters			0

@entity21 's @entity57 takes a tumble following the twin challenge of @entity29 ( left ) and @entity33 @entity5 is upended by the challenge of @entity21 midfielder @entity53 @entity39 ( left ) and @entity50 both hit the turf as the @entity167 chases his first goal looked to add to his single goal in 13 appearances but on the evidence of the opening 45 minutes , @entity2 's side needed all the help they could get			1
the anxiety in @entity19 's attacking play even trickled back to their usually tight defence in the 36th minute , goalkeeper @entity28 misjudging a high ball , nearly allowing @entity117 to tap into an empty net			1
palace keeper @entity48 made the first real stop of the night in the 40th minute , saving @entity35 's shot from a half - cleared @entity34 corner at his near post			1
@entity122 midfielder @entity35 ( left ) rises high to beat @entity54 to a high ball in the @entity21 box @entity19 goalkeeper @entity28 gets down to secure the loose ball under pressure from the onrushing @entity55 @entity19 striker @entity39 blows a great chance to break the deadlock as he shoots wide from close range @entity19 manager @entity2 ( right ) watches on from the technical area with @entity21 boss @entity68 not far away the rebound fell to @entity39 , but the struggling striker could only stab his effort wide from close range			1
during the opening months of the season , the ball would have nestled in the back of the net for the @entity167			2
how he must long for those heady days			0
so to must have @entity2 as he faced up to yet another half - time team talk without a goal from his side			2
likewise , @entity21 offered next to nothing in the attacking third during the opening 45 minutes , nevertheless @entity68 would have been satisfied with the outcome of their first half			2
he 'd have been even happier if @entity28 had n't produced an excellent save from @entity56 in the 48th minute after the @entity122 forward turned @entity31 brilliantly in the box			2
seven minutes later the visitors went even closer , @entity55 hitting the inside of @entity28 's far post after the @entity216 goalkeeper 's initial save from @entity57			0
@entity2 replaced @entity35 with @entity36 just before the hour mark in search of attacking impetus , @entity40 and @entity217 soon followed			0
@entity122 boss @entity2 was fearing another goalless 90 minutes from his side in the 69th minute when @entity31 somehow fired wide from three yards after @entity34 's corner			1
but eight minutes from time , @entity24 's erupted as @entity5 fired home after @entity48 failed to hold from @entity217 's shot			1
@entity21 goalkeeper @entity48 tips the ball over the bar as both sides struggles in front of goal continue @entity29 is hit hard in a sliding tackle by @entity21 's @entity58 during a tense second half of action @entity21 boss @entity68 has a word with @entity57 as his side look to hold on for a precious draw late on			1

@entity5 *pounced* in the 83rd minute to score @entity19 's first home goal in four games
the @entity240 fired past @entity48 after the @entity21 eeper failed to deal with @entity242 's shot
