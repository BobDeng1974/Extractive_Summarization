when a young mum posted images of her post-pregnancy body on @entity4 to inspire others , she might have anticipated a raft of supportive comments for her bravery			1
@entity9 , 20 , from @entity10 in @entity11 , did n't get that far though ; her images of the stretchmarks on her tummy were vetoed by the world 's biggest photo - sharing website within minutes of her posting them			1
the mum - of - twins claims her account was deleted because the images were deemed to contain inappropriate ' nudity and violence ' which breach the site 's decency guidelines			1
she gave birth to twin girls @entity39 ( pictured above with fiance @entity40 , 22 ) in june last year @entity9 suffered from stretch marks after giving birth to twin girls @entity44 and @entity45 with fiance @entity40 , 22 , in june last year			1
@entity9 said : ' nobody could get on my @entity4 and nobody could search for it so someone had obviously reported the picture for nudity - all it was was a picture of my belly and it has just took my confidence away			1
' it 's yet another example of @entity4 coming under fire for refusing to publish certain images , particularly photos that are dedicated to showing the female form in its most honest state			1
shots of menstrual blood , stretchmarks following childbirth , pubic hair and naked breasts have all felt the wrath of the site 's censors			1
critics have also highlighted that plenty of images that many might find offensive such as users bragging about extreme wealth while poking fun at the poor or pro-guns graffiti often get the green light for publication			2
just last week , @entity4 , which boasts 300 million monthly users , announced that it has toughened up its rules on the types of pictures users can post in a bid to cut down on pornography and harassment			1
@entity90 received an apology from @entity4 for removing these images of her in her underwear			1
the 19 - year - old had posted the shot to celebrate her curves ... but later found they had been removed @entity98 saw a picture of her bottom - covered by sizeable black pants - banned for contravening @entity4 's rules , even though she posted it in a spirit of body confidence with the hashtags # honormycurves and # effyourbeautystandards the overhaul of @entity4 's community guidelines is the biggest since @entity108 bought the app three years ago for $ 1 billion			2
although it has banned ' close - ups of fully nude buttocks ' , it remains perfectly fine to post a shot of a woman 's rear if she is wearing underwear			0
a spokesman for the site said : ' we know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature , but for a variety of reasons , we do n’t allow nudity on @entity4			1
one rule for one : images such as the shot above , taken from the picture stream of @entity135 social media star @entity133 , appear liberally on the site star support : @entity138 joined the campaign to use images of bare breasts by tweeting this picture on her @ @entity143 last year the # freethenipple campaign saw a host of web users staging their protests against what they perceived as sexism by @entity4 ' this includes photos , videos , and some digitally - created content that show sexual intercourse , genitals , and close - ups of fully - nude buttocks			1
' it also includes some photos of female nipples , but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed			0
' nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is ok , too			0
' however , the boundaries laid out above seem to contradict the image posted by many			0
when singer - songwriter @entity173 published an image of her bottom in underwear in may 2014 , she was dismayed to find it promptly removed for being deemed as ' mature ' content			0
@entity98 says you do n't need to wander very far on @entity4 to find images of photos of other women in a similar pose , which have all been published by the site , leading to accusations that she was discriminated against because she was bigger than some of the bikini models who feature			1
elsewhere , earlier this year , an @entity191 media agency @entity190 claimed the site had removed one of its images which showed two women wearing bikinis and showing some pubic hair			1
@entity190 said the photo - sharing site had ' censored ' their image and argued that it was a sexist move and it would not have happened had the shot been a picture of two men			2
@entity205 , the agency 's director , said at the time : ' unfortunately @entity4 has ruled out natural hair that appears on all bodies of women that do n't trim their bikini lines			1
' this hair occasionally does spill out of the sides of swimwear as it does on men in their underwear			0
but @entity4 seem to be ok with man pubes			2
' he added : ' clearly this is absolutely sexist			0
@entity4 believes that women should wax or get off their platform			2
' this shot , published by @entity191 media agency @entity190 , was banned by @entity4 for showing public hair			1
the agency said it though the image would have been published if it had shown two men when photographer @entity228 published a photo of a woman lying fully clothed on a bed with menstrual blood between her legs , the site removed it twice , saying that @entity228 was n't following ' community guidelines '			0
other high profile bans include a protest by @entity237 ( daughter of @entity239 and @entity240 ) who saw a photo of a jumper with two bare - breasted women on it removed from the site			0
@entity239 said at the time : ' women are regularly kicked off @entity4 for posting photos with any portion of the areola exposed			2
' while photos sans nipple – degrading as they might be – remain unchallenged			0
' such ' unchallenged ' images might include the profile of @entity135 poker player @entity133 , who regularly posts near pornographic images of women alongside misogynistic language			0
his posts include a woman dressed in provocative school uniform - type dress but with her shirt tied beneath her breasts and only pink tape covering her nipples			2
in other shots , scantily clad women cavort together or thrust their cleavage into the camera			0
after pressure from critics , the world 's most popular photo - sharing website has been forced to clarify how it treats certain images			0
last week , @entity4 said it was making clearer what exactly is allowed			2
' we know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature , but for a variety of reasons , we do n’t allow nudity on @entity4			1
fans were not happy when @entity287 shared this @entity4 photo from his @entity290 holiday accompanying it with hashtags that included the words ' # myhumps # babygotback # hungryshorts ' despite stipulating that close - ups of ' fully nude buttocks ' are banned on the service , @entity295 posted a side - on view of her posterior without complaints ' this includes photos , videos , and some digitally - created content that show sexual intercourse , genitals , and close - ups of fully - nude buttocks			2
' it also includes some photos of female nipples , but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed			0
' nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is ok , too			0
' its censoring filter may have received attention but as our images show , there are plenty of photos that might cause offense that have made it through : when global music star @entity287 posed in front of a female in @entity290 last week to deliberately highlight her bottom , the image was promptly published to his million - strong following on @entity4			1
the photo , which the singer tagged with the words ' # myhumps @entity337 ' , shows a close shot of @entity287 in the foreground while the rear of a female shopper was clearly in view			0
in spite of a public apology and wide criticism , the image remains on @entity287 's site			0
such ' unchallenged ' images might include the photostream of @entity135 poker player @entity133 , who regularly posts images of scantily clad women			0
many @entity4 users will be baffled as to why an image depicting a woman who is practically topless , as her shirt is tied beneath her bust , has been allowed to stay on the site			1
bar two bits of tape on her nipples , the woman 's breasts are entirely bare , yet it falls within the rules , essentially on a technicality thanks to the strategically placed tape			0
@entity295 , meanwhile , posted a provocative that depicts the side of her entirely naked bottom , with a car balanced on the top of one cheek , yet despite the stipulation regarding ' close ups of fully - nude buttocks ' , the shot has been deemed acceptable			2
hypocritical ? @entity4 says it does n't allow nudity on the site , yet enables shots such as the above to appear on the page of @entity135 poker player @entity133 only words , say @entity4 ... this image promoting the use of guns was published by user andygotphotos beyond the pale ? a young user came under fire for describing her father as her ' man crush monday ' every day			1
this inappropriate post was then compounded by her hashtags that reveal she 's at her great grandmother 's funeral			0
despite ongoing bloodshed in @entity397 , positive messages and pictures of the country 's president , @entity400 , are regularly uploaded to the site , with no objections from @entity4			1

young mum @entity9 , 20 , had shots of her stretchmarks taken down
@entity4 has also censored images of *periods* , pubic hair and nipples
yet provocative images of bikini models are deemed appropriate
those who have had their shots censored accuse the site of sexism
