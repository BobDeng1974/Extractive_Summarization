@entity0 is remembered as one of the greatest minds of his generation - but during his lifetime , he was convinced that his achievements would be swiftly forgotten			2
in a newly unearthed interview , the @entity7 founder complained that because of the fast pace of technological innovation , his inventions became out - of - date within just a few years			1
' all the work that i have done in my life will be obsolete by the time i 'm 50 , ' @entity0 said in the interview , recorded in 1994 when he was 39			1
in the years to come before his death in 2011 , he would go on to launch revolutionary devices such as the @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			2
however , in 1994 he pointed out that technological breakthroughs were inherently fleeting , because they were inevitably overtaken by newer innovations			1
' this is not a field where one paints a painting that will be looked at for centuries , or builds a church that will be admired for centuries , ' he said			1
' this is a field where one does one 's work and then in 10 years it 's obsolete - and really will not be usable within 10 or 20 years			2

' you 're building up a mountain and you get to contribute your little layer of sedimentary rock to make the mountain that much higher			0
' but no one on the surface , unless they have x-ray vision , will see your sediment			0
they 'll stand on it			0
it 'll be appreciated by that rare geologist			0
