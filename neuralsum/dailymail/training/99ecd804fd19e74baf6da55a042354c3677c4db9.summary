by dr @entity0 published : 17:27 est , 12 october 2013 updated : 17:27 est , 12 october 2013 personally , i blame ‘ doctor @entity2 ’			2
as empowering as the internet has been in helping us take charge of our health – from online pharmacy services to sites such as @entity10 where we can research any illnesses we may have and their potential treatments – it has also led to something more worrying			2
more than ever , people are trying to diagnose and treat themselves rather than consulting a doctor			2
while i was aware of it from my own practice , the true extent is quite astounding			2
playing doctor : home remedies can sometimes even make a condition or ailment worse for it ’s one thing treating your cold with hot drinks and honey , but the @entity30 ‘ cures ’ some people try are far beyond anything i had imagined			1
i have seen countless patients who tried home remedies before finally making it to my surgery and i ’m used to garlic for sore throats and bananas for diarrhoea			1
so when the opportunity came up to be involved with new @entity43 series @entity41 , which will put some of people ’s home cures to the test , i was n’t expecting to be surprised			1
testing the treatments the series , which starts on october 21 , will give those who truly believe in their diy cures , no matter how strange or unbelievable they are , the chance to put them to a panel of medical professionals and find out what we doctors think			1
across the series , the panel of doctors , including myself , dr @entity58 and dr @entity59 , are pitched to by more than 40 people , who all genuinely believe in their home remedy			1
[ caption from oat baths for psoriasis and duct tape for verrucas to gargling with coconut oil for gingivitis and – bizarrely – breast milk for skin infections , we have heard a number of compelling cases for cures that could really work and should be explored further			1
some we even put to the test in a small trial , too			1
but surprisingly , we also heard from people who ’ve been using treatments that are downright dangerous			0
just give it a squirt of @entity80 two of the first people to pitch were builders @entity84 and @entity85			0
they told us how they use @entity80 , the industrial lubricant spray used to repel water and prevent corrosion , as a cure for arthritis and chest pain			1
they have been spraying this product on their skin			2
apparently it is a common builders ’ remedy , and many across the country use it , genuinely believing it will treat their ailments			0
as a doctor who ’s never used @entity80 anywhere other than my bike , i could n’t quite believe it			0
but our contributors really believed in their remedy , so we had to warn them to stop and try something more appropriate for their condition and designed for human use			0
why home remedies work however , as we questioned @entity84 and @entity85 on how they believed it worked , it became clear why they could be seeing some improvement in their ailments ; with something like this there is almost certainly a placebo effect , particularly in the case of @entity85 ’s tight chest			1
he genuinely felt an instant improvement , as if he ’d used an inhaler			0
the belief that something is doing you good can be powerful and in some cases is not to be dismissed			0
however , rubbing a product like @entity80 directly into the skin is definitely not a good idea , as it has not been tested on humans			2
and of course when i listened to @entity85 ’s chest before and after he ’d applied the @entity80 there was no clinical improvement			2
in the case of the arthritis , it ’s more likely that the improvement was due to the physical act of massaging , which we know reduces pain , rather than any chemical effect from the @entity80 spray			2
more harm than good ? safer massaging with ibuprofen gels , for example , would do just as good , if not a better , job – and at least we know they are harmless			0
we advised @entity84 and @entity85 to stop using this potentially dangerous cure ; it could be a skin irritant and we have no idea of the potential long - term harmful effects			1
but i ’m pretty sure they believe in it so much that they ignored us , and the science			0
yet even people using remedies handed down through generations could be doing more harm than good : one person we met was placing copper coins on her eye to treat a stye			0
while styes may not even need treatment , using money covered in bacteria could spread and worsen what starts out as a minor infection			0
warding off verrucas : duct tape was found to be a successful way of treating verrucas sticking it with the duct tape one of the first cases we put to a trial was that of @entity186 , who came to us with a cure for verrucas			1
something simple , cheap and in his opinion effective : duct tape			1
@entity186 simply covered his painful and long - standing verrucas with a piece of duct tape for seven days , then repeated this process for about a month and his once - stubborn verrucas disappeared			1
this was pretty compelling because he had already tried the plethora of conventional treatments that doctors like me offer for verrucas			1
i was sceptical but fascinated to see if it worked , as many patients suffer with recurring verrucas and warts			2
collectively as medical practitioners , we thought there could be something in this because of the oxygen starvation , so we conducted a small trial			0
not as daft as it sounds half of our volunteers used duct tape on their verrucas and half used normal surgical tape , and they all kept video diaries for the month over which the trial took place			1
some experiences were good and some not so much			0
however , when @entity186 came back for the results we were able to reveal that every participant who had used duct tape had seen a reduction in the size of their verrucas of at least 1mm , which is impressive			1
it certainly merits further investigation			0
we found promising results with other home - made remedies , too – for example when one psoriasis sufferer showed that her skin had almost completely healed simply by bathing with oats			1
oats are used already in certain skin creams , so this could also warrant further trials to assess their use for serious skin conditions			1
the series has raised some interesting questions			0
some contributors we met identified potential options for further investigation			0
but not every suggestion was feasible : frankly some were hazardous and bizarre , so i would always recommend people seek medical advice rather than trying to heal themselves with unproven treatments			0
@entity41 starts on @entity43 on monday , october 21 , at 8.30pm .			0
