@entity1 's @entity0 was delighted after she broke the national record and claimed silver in the 400 metres hurdles on the fourth day of the @entity5 in @entity6			1
the 18 - year - old came home second in a time of 56.16 seconds , close behind winner @entity10 , who clocked 55.66secs , while her @entity13 compatriot @entity12 was third with a @entity14 of 56.22			1
@entity0 said : ' it means a lot			2
i 've been training for this all year			1
in my head i was thinking " come on fight for that place " and i completely forgot about the national record			2
i think as soon as you forget about things like that it 's when you get them			2
all smiles : @entity29 's @entity0 poses alongside @entity13 duo @entity10 ( gold ) and @entity12 ( bronze ) ' in my head in the whole week i 've been looking for a medal and i wanted second because that 's where i should be from the rankings , so to get that is brilliant and i ca n't really ask for much more			1
' it was quite a clean race ; i was a bit worried about being from lane six because i knew i could n't see my main competition on the inside of me			0
' i was a bit nervous about that but i just went out nearly as fast as i could and tried to stick with it			0
i think i did quite well , i got my stride pattern and everything and it all went really well			0
' i completely forgot about the @entity48 record so it was great when i realised i 'd got it and it 's kind of a double win			0
' i 've been looking at that all season but whenever i really thought about it i 'd run a race where i should have got it and mess up			0
so in a race where all i was thinking about was medals the time came with it and the @entity48 record is a bonus			1
