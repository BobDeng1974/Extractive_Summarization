a female fighter pilot yesterday led @entity2 ’s first combat mission against @entity3 – as the @entity4 launched two waves of attack against the deadly terrorists			1
the unnamed officer piloted one of two heavily - armed jets that flew from a top - security @entity4 base in @entity12 on the dangerous sortie over is - held territory in @entity15 , before returning safely to complete her 2,000 - mile round trip			1
the sortie , lasting several hours , was the first mission for the @entity4 ’s @entity20 against @entity22 militants			1
and last night two more @entity24 aircraft took off from the @entity12 base , bound for @entity15			1
defence sources conceded last night that neither of the @entity35 in the first wave engaged the enemy and both jets returned to @entity47 with their full payloads of rockets and ammunition intact – highlighting growing concern over whether @entity2 is pulling its weight in the coalition arrayed against @entity22			1
@entity55 pilots conducted hundreds of sorties over @entity57 as part of @entity2 ’s war against the @entity60			0
in early 2010 , flight lieutenant @entity61 ( right ) described how she was repeatedly called upon to swoop down within 100ft of rocket - wielding fanatics to disrupt their attacks on @entity2 troops in @entity66			2
@entity67 was based at @entity68 , @entity69 , where many of the air crew serving as part as @entity20 are based			0
there are thought to be about ten female fighter pilots cleared to fly @entity75 or @entity55 jets in combat missions for the @entity4			0
the @entity77 by contrast , yesterday continued their heavy bombardment of key is strongholds around the city of @entity82 , in @entity83 , where it is believed @entity2 hostages @entity86 and @entity87 are being held under threat of decapitation			1
the @entity90 was invited to witness the first @entity35 taking off , as @entity2 finally joined the international coalition taking offensive action against @entity22 , which has taken control of vast areas of @entity15 and @entity83			1
the mission remained the subject of secrecy last night as defence sources refused to disclose whether the @entity4 pilots had flown in support of @entity39 or @entity102 fighters and whether the mission had been a success			1
the first mission was described as a ‘ routine operational sortie ’ with air crews using new rules of engagement approved by @entity109 on friday for the first time			0
a defence source said : ‘ the mission involved responding to a changing situation on the ground , with moving targets rather than static positions being on the agenda			0
‘ the aircraft were equipped with weapon systems reflecting the operational requirements but on this occasion no rockets were fired			0
‘ the two @entity35 then flew back to @entity47 and the crews went through their routine debriefing process			2
‘ it is likely that further missions will take place in the days ahead			0
’ the @entity128 understands that yesterday ’s first mission was conducted by @entity4 and followed a request for air support received on friday evening – only a few hours after mps voted by an overwhelming majority of 524 votes to 43 to endorse attacks on the militants in @entity15			1
the requirements of the specific mission were then pieced together overnight and into yesterday morning , with officers from the @entity4 ’s 140 @entity140 ( @entity140 ) , which deployed to @entity12 last month , liaising with staff at @entity142 ( @entity142 ) back in @entity2			1
then , at about 9.30am and in humid conditions at the base on @entity12 ’s southern coast , the chosen pilots and navigators emerged from a hangar and walked casually towards their aircraft			2
they spent almost an hour inspecting every inch of the @entity35 , checking for any fault which could compromise their safety			0
then the crews climbed two - by - two inside their aircraft , strapped themselves and lowered the canopies			0
until yesterday , their missions , though vital , had been benign			0
this was the first time they could have been called upon to extinguish human life			0
at around 10.30am , the @entity35 rolled onto the runway and , with a deafening howl of their @entity166 engines , sped across the tarmac and ascended rapidly into the overcast @entity169 skies			0
they were followed minutes later by a huge @entity171 refuelling aircraft , used to top up aviation gas supplies for the round trip to @entity15			0
as a diplomatic courtesy to countries who do not wish to publicise their role in the coalition against @entity22 , defence sources declined to disclose the flight path taken by the aircraft as they flew to and from the battlefield			1
the pilots were guided over is - held territory by @entity77 flight planners			1
the involvement of a woman @entity4 pilot comes after female pilot @entity189 of the @entity191 was revealed to have flown an f - 16 jet in bombing raids against @entity22 positions in @entity83 last week			1
yesterday , the @entity77 and other coalition countries again conducted air strikes against known is targets inside the enemy ’s heartland of @entity83			2
defence experts have argued that the only way to defeat is is to target them where they are strongest but @entity2 forces remain restricted in where they may launch attacks against the jihadis			0
it was with great relief to all 2,500 military and civilian personnel stationed at @entity47 that the first pair of jets touched down safely at around 3.30pm local time yesterday			2
@entity24 's at @entity12 being armed with the @entity212 ground crew load the @entity35 with a @entity215 precision - guided bomb ( above and right )			1
the aircraft is famed for its ability to carry an extensive range and configuration of weapons – including the @entity223 anti-armour missile – with a total weight of 9,000kg ( 19,800lb ) @entity226 @entity24 aircrew prepare to depart @entity47 in @entity12 , armed with @entity215 laser guided bombs , in support of @entity20 shortly afterwards , defence sources confirmed that neither aircraft undertook offensive action and that – despite media attention – the mission had been restricted to reconnaissance and intelligence - gathering			1
an @entity242 spokesman said : ‘ @entity226 @entity24 aircraft have been flying intelligence gathering missions over @entity15 for a number of weeks			2
today , following the parliamentary approval given yesterday , in company with other aircraft from the international coalition , two @entity35 conducted armed reconnaissance operations over areas of @entity15 where the terrorists threaten the civilian population			2
‘ although on this occasion no targets were identified as requiring immediate air attack by our aircraft , the intelligence gathered by the @entity35 ’ highly sophisticated surveillance equipment will be invaluable in developing the best possible understanding of @entity259 ’s disposition and help acquire potential targets for future operations			2
‘ furthermore , we know that the very presence of coalition air power has a significant impact on @entity259 ’s efforts to attack the @entity39 people			0
‘ with no effective defence against air strikes , and knowing the precision with which coalition aircraft can hit them , the terrorists are forced to be much more cautious , keeping their forces dispersed and movement inhibited			0
a pair of @entity24 jets flew in support of @entity39 troops engaging is terrorists in trench warfare below ‘ they also know that should they concentrate to deliver an attack against @entity39 or @entity102 troops , aircraft are likely to arrive overhead very soon afterwards			1
’ news of the @entity35 ’ first sorties came as the @entity2 - based @entity289 said that @entity77 air strikes in @entity82 killed 23 is terrorists yesterday			1
there was fierce fighting between @entity102 militia and the @entity22 fanatics for the town of @entity297 on the @entity83 - @entity299 border , which has been besieged for the last ten days			2
most of the local population – numbering about 150,000 people – have poured into @entity299 as the is fighters battle for control of the strategically important area			0
dozens of @entity22 extremists continued to shell the town yesterday			0
