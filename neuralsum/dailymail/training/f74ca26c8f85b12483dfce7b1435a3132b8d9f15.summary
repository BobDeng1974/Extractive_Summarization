@entity21 , left , took two men back to her house on the promise of sex , so they could kill her husband of 14 years @entity24 , pictured right			1
once they got to the house she told both men she wanted her husband dead once there , the men launched a savage attack on the 61 - year - old retired newsagent which left him with 46 separate injuries			1
@entity9 , who was out of the house at the time buying cocaine , returned to the house in @entity36 , @entity37 , to find her husband lying in a pool of blood - but stepped over his body instead of calling an ambulance			1
help was only summoned half - an - hour later by a worried friend of 44 - year - old @entity9 who she had spoken to on the phone			1
prosecutors said that if there had not been a delay in dialling 999 , mr @entity9 may have survived			1
following a four - week trial , a jury of five women and seven men found @entity9 , @entity15 and @entity16 guilty of mr @entity9 ’s murder			1
@entity9 was today jailed for a minimum of 23 years , while @entity15 , 40 , and @entity16 , 27 , were each jailed for 18 years			1
@entity16 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) were both found guilty of the murder of @entity9 at @entity57 sentencing the trio at @entity57 , the judge , his honour mr justice @entity60 , said : ' the killing of @entity9 in his own home was a truly shocking offence			1
' on the evidence i have heard , i ’m satisfied he was a man who offered no harm to any of you and who indeed had , over a number of years , tolerated the wilful and manipulative behaviour of an unfaithful wife			0
' judge mr @entity74 told @entity9 she was the ' instigator ' of the attack , which took place in the village of @entity79 last october			1
he added : ' you caused the killing for your own selfish reasons			0
' there is evidence to show that for a period of time prior to his death , you wanted the prompt termination of the life of your husband			2
i am sure a factor in motivation was gain for yourself			0
' during the trial , prosecutor @entity95 told the court that the couple , who had been together for 17 years in total , had a rocky relationship peppered with break - ups and reconciliations , and divorce had been discussed			2
the trial heard that on the day of the killing @entity9 , who had a string of lovers , told a close friend : " i ca n't take any more of him			1
' i 've had enough of @entity110			0
the only way to get him out of my life is to kill him			0
' hours later she started flirting with strangers @entity15 and @entity16 in a wine bar and persuaded them to return home with her			1
when police arrived at the scene after the attack , @entity9 was heard to say : ' oh @entity122 , i think i have killed him			2
' @entity123 has issued a picture of a clamp that was used in @entity9 's murder but she quickly claimed she had no idea mr @entity9 was going to be attacked , and had returned to find him lying injured			1
she told jurors she failed to call an ambulance because she was ' in shock '			0
in the weeks leading up to the killing , @entity9 had moved out of the marital home to live with a 21 - year - old ' toy boy '			2
jurors were told that despite her unfaithfulness , mr @entity9 continued to send his wife money and allowed her to return home after she claimed her younger lover had beaten her up			1
but just a week before his death , @entity9 had talked of killing her husband with sleeping pills and making his death look like an accident			1
@entity95 , prosecuting , told the jury : ' the deceased was a man of some wealth			0
friends of the couple thought that @entity7 was using the deceased			1
' she would speak openly about gaining access to his home and money , stating : ' i 'll have that house			2
i will use any means whatsoever to get it '			1
' the court heard that in the event of mr @entity9 passing away , his estate would be split between his wife and two children , @entity167 , 34 , by his first marriage , and @entity169 , 16 , who was his daughter with @entity9			2
@entity9 would have got the £ 400,000 marital home , a cash payment of £ 250,000 , all of his belongings and half of future rents from other properties he owned			2
the total would have been around £ 1million			0
jailed : @entity9 was jailed at @entity57 for a minimum of 23 years while @entity15 and @entity16 were both sentenced to 18 years in a statement read to the court after the verdicts , @entity169 , who now lives with her boyfriend 's family , said her father was ' generous and caring '			1
she added : ' my dad meant everything to me			0
' he was the best kind of father anyone could have			0
if i had problems he would always be there for me			0
he called me ' princess '			0
' following the sentencing today , mr @entity9 's daughter , @entity167 , said outside court : ' we are truly devastated that we will never again see our dear old dad smile , and that he will miss out on watching his beloved grandchildren grow @entity203 have a child ask why their grandad had to die and not know the answer myself is beyond words			1
' forty - six injuries in his own home			0
we are in complete shock and disbelief that this has happened to our dad			0
' the knowledge that our father was forced to suffer in the way he did , as arranged by someone whom , against all the advice from his friends , he supported for so long , is an unspeakable burden of knowledge to now have to carry through our lives			0
' i believe @entity15 and @entity16 were caught up in the premeditated actions of @entity225			1
but they , along with her , must now face the consequences			0
' @entity229 , a friend of mr @entity9 's , said : ' @entity110 loved her right until the very end			1
he loved her to pieces			0
' she took the life of a loving father			0
quite callously and absolutely , deliberately , with no thought for anyone else except herself			0
' her only motive was financial gain			0
she obviously did n't love him - because she was telling everyone she did n't love him			0
' speaking outside the court , @entity244 superintendent @entity243 , from @entity123 , said : ' i think the sentences today would reflect the severity of the attack on @entity9			2
' it was a horrible attack , it was planned by his wife and she recruited two men earlier in the evening to carry out the attack and they 've received the justice that they deserved			0
' @entity7 has come across as an extremely cold and calculating woman			2
she obviously took @entity9 for all she could get			2
he was besotted with her and she took advantage of that and carried on doing that until she killed him			0
' it 's our belief and the prosecution case that she did this to try and get money			2
she wanted a divorce , she wanted access to his house , he did n't want to sell the house and she thought this was the only way to get what she wanted			0

@entity7 , 45 , told friends she would get her husband @entity24 's house and money by ' any means whatsoever '
@entity9 lured @entity15 , 40 , and @entity16 , 27 , to her house with the promise of sex but then told them she wanted her husband dead
@entity9 jailed for a minimum of 23 years while @entity286 and @entity16 both sentenced to 18 years in prison
