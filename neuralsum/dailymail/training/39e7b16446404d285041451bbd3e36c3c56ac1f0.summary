by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 07:44 est , 4 march 2014 attempting to land on a rotating comet racing through the solar system at 150,000 mph is no easy feat. but why bother trying , when you can just fire off a harpoon to collect samples at a safe distance with surgical precision ? that ’s exactly what @entity11 is attempting to do with its prototype designs of a space harpoon which it hopes will return rock samples that could reveal the origins of planets			1
pictured is an artist 's concept of a tethered ' penetrator ' heading toward a celestial body to take a sample ‘ this technology will be able for the first time to pull samples of the order of a few kilograms from depths of a few metres , which could greatly enhance our knowledge of solar system objects , ’ @entity27 of the @entity28 wrote in a @entity11 report			1
‘ moreover , it offers the opportunity to take multiple samples at little extra cost so that it will provide much greater flexibility and greatly enhance the science return for any given mission , ’ he added			1
the conventional way to do a robotic sample - return mission is to perform a soft landing on a celestial object , collect small amounts of material and then return it to @entity53			1
the technology will be able , for the first time , to pull samples of the order of a few kilograms from depths of a few metres from celestial objects such as comets while @entity11 is looking at the use of harpoons to collect samples for celestial bodies , @entity60 engineers believe similar technology could be used to clear up space junk			1
@entity68 - based @entity67 has plans to develop ' chase ' satellite fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target			0
using laser and radar guidance systems , a piece of space junk would be targeted , and then captured with a gas - propelled harpoon on a tether			2
once the space junk is secured , a smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the @entity53 's atmosphere			1
then the chase satellite would search out another target			0
experts hope the system could remove around five pieces of space debris a year			0
this is what the @entity94 probe is planning to do in august when it reaches the comet @entity96 – one of the most risky parts of its mission			0
‘ we 're not talking about doing that , ’ professor @entity27 said earlier this month , according to a report in @entity102			2
‘ we 're talking about using the kinetic energy of the spacecraft as it 's moving past the object , and we 're not asking the system to brake , so you save energy			2
’ the team 's design currently uses a sample - return spacecraft to carry six , rocket - shaped penetrators , which would be fired down at the celestial body during a flyby			1
the penetrators , attached to a tether , would hit at a high speed of up to 2,240 mph ( 3,605 km / h , or 1 km / sec ) and go deep beneath the surface			1
several pounds of material would then be collected in a tube , which would be reeled back in to send back to @entity53			1
researchers have been testing the equipment by firing test harpoons into a 55 - gallon drum full of cometary simulant - sand , salt , pebbles or a mixture of each			0
the bow string is pulled back by an electric winch to generate a precise level of force , up to 1,000 pounds , firing the harpoon at 70mph			0
the team 's design currently uses a sample - return spacecraft to carry six , rocket - shaped penetrators , which would be fired down at the celestial body during a flyby			1
a demonstration of the sample collection chamber is pictured lead engineer @entity145 said : ‘ we had to bolt it to the floor , because the recoil made the whole testbed jump after every shot			0
' we 're not sure what we 'll encounter on the comet – the surface could be soft and fluffy , mostly made up of dust , or it could be ice mixed with pebbles , or even solid rock			2
' most likely , there will be areas with different compositions , so we need to design a harpoon that 's capable of penetrating a reasonable range of materials			2
’ comets are frozen chunks of ice and dust left over from our solar system 's formation			0
as such , scientists want a closer look at them for clues to the origin of planets and ultimately , how life formed on @entity53			0
the technology could be used to collect samples from comets that could reveal how life forms on other planets			0
pictured is @entity181 before it burnt up following a flyby close to the sun			0

@entity186 prototype designed to get several metres below comet 's surface
design involves 6 rocket - shaped ‘ penetrators ’ being fired at celestial body
penetrators , attached to a tether , would hit at speeds of up to 2,240 mph
several kilograms of material would then be collected in a tube , which would be reeled in to send back to @entity53
