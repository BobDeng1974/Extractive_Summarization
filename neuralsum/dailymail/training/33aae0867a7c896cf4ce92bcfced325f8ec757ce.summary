a serial cheater who was married to two women at the same time will not be prosecuted for bigamy - even though his first wife reported him to the police			1
@entity8 and @entity9 tied the knot in @entity11 , @entity12 , in 2011 , two years after they spoke over the telephone in a job interview after a rocky start to their marriage , where @entity9 would spend days away from home at a time , they decided to separate - but did not divorce			1
they separated after a rocky start to the relationship , but miss @entity8 soon discovered he married someone else devastated : miss @entity8 said there were no words that could hurt her as much when she found out @entity33 was married to another woman , so she decided to report the matter to the police months later miss @entity8 was devastated when she found out he had wed another woman , even though they still were legally married			1
she told @entity40 6 that a friend found court documents proving @entity9 had married @entity43 in september			1
he had been married to the two women at the same time for nine months			0
' to hear that he married someone else , i do n't think there are other words that a person could hear that could hurt as much , ' she said			2
miss @entity8 then reported @entity33 to the police , saying he had committed bigamy , a felony that carries a five year prison sentence			1
he even admitted the crime in a post on his blog called ' @entity61 of @entity62 '			1
he wrote : ' on a drug binge , i did not realize what i was doing , but i actually married a woman while i was already married – upon realizing what i had done , i immediately told her that i could not be with her & we dissolved the marriage ( hence the technically having been married three times )			2
' in my own defense , most of these poor decisions were made under the influence of and / or in the pursuit of substance abuse – therefore incoherent			0
' however , to me , that is no excuse for my personal failings			0
i looked the other way while my employees misled clients			0
' i cheated profusely in relationships			0
i offered financial payout to women in exchange for pleasure ( never outright prostitution )			0
basically , i became a filthy & unrecognizable monster			0
' miss @entity8 filed a complaint with the @entity91			1
in the incident report , deputy @entity93 wrote , ' @entity92 has committed the crime of bigamy ' and indicated a criminal charge would be filed with the state attorney 's office			0
but before it was processed , @entity100 authorities sent the complaint to the @entity102 , where @entity9 's second marriage occurred			2
proceedings : miss @entity8 ( left ) filed a complaint , but detectives found that @entity9 's ( right ) second wife , @entity43 , was filing for divorce and did not want to prosecute , so they dropped the case @entity112 sheriff 's spokeswoman @entity110 said they initially investigated what had happened			1
however they soon discovered that @entity9 's second wife @entity43 was in the process of divorcing him and did not want to participate in the investigation			1
@entity43 told local 6 : ' he 's dead to me , buried with a tombstone			2
i had no reason to suspect he was married			0
' @entity110 added : ' the second wife , who would have been the victim , has declined to prosecute ; therefore our detectives closed the case			0
' under @entity12 law , the original marriage is the only valid one			0
even though he has admitted to the crime online and authorities have received a complaint , bigamists in @entity12 are rarely prosecuted			2
since 2000 , only 14 defendants were prosecuted for bigamy in @entity100 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			2
only one , @entity140 , was sentenced to prison , where he served 9 months			0
in response , @entity9 said he has now been admitted into a drug treatment program			2
in an earlier blog post he wrote : ' being an entrepreneur is who i am			1
being a good person is who i want to be			0
' truth : @entity9 said he married the second woman during a ' drug binge ' and has now been admitted into a drug treatment program			1
he admitted he had committed bigamy in a post on his blog			1
