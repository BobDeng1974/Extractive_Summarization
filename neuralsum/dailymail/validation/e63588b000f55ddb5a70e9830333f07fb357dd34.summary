@entity0 concedes they had anticipated @entity2 would spend the majority of the season with @entity27 ’s development squad			1
@entity9 striker @entity2 has impressed for the @entity7 since arriving from @entity12 in the summer on sunday , however , he will lead the line at @entity30 as @entity31 begin the first of seven matches without top goalscorer @entity34 , banned for his part in the shameful spitting incident with @entity31 ’s @entity37			1

but he was thrown in at the deep end and he dealt with it			0
’ @entity2 was named @entity70 this week having also collected best breakthrough player in @entity9 following his 16 goals in their second tier last term			1
