by @entity0 published : 17:52 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 17:52 est , 21 may 2012 @entity1 could slip back into the hands of extremists and pose a terrorist threat to the @entity5 when @entity8 troops leave , experts have warned			1
@entity9 claimed at a @entity11 summit yesterday that plans for withdrawal by the end of december 2014 are ‘ on track and on target ’			1
@entity17 went even further , declaring that the allies would soon be able to say : ‘ the @entity1 war as we know it is over			1
’ ' the war is over ' : president @entity17 , accompanied by prime minister @entity9 , speaking during the meeting on @entity1 during the @entity22 in @entity23 yesterday but despite those optimistic statements , the @entity25 commander of @entity11 ’s troops said they would have to fight their way out of the country			1
a senior @entity8 official also conceded that it was ‘ unrealistic ’ to assume @entity1 ‘ is going to be completely secure ’ or that there would be ‘ no possiblity of a terrorist threat re-emerging ’			1
with this in mind , up to 200 members of the @entity36 will remain to take on @entity39 into 2015			0
the admission raises questions about whether @entity8 ’s deployment in @entity1 , designed to deprive the terrorist group of a safe haven , has been worth the thousands of injuries and 414 fatalities suffered by the @entity47			1
unified front : mr @entity9 also claimed at the summit yesterday that plans for withdrawal from @entity1 by the end of december 2014 are ' on track and on target ' all smiles : mr @entity17 greets participants during the @entity58 event at the @entity22			1
despite his remarks , experts warned that it was unrealistic to expect @entity1 to be completely free of terrorism yesterday ’s summit was designed to set out a final timetable for the handover to @entity1 security forces , which will lead all combat operations by mid- 2013			1
general @entity68 said he ‘ fully expects that combat is going to continue ’ past that milestone			0
‘ there is no end of combat before the end of 2014 , ’ he added			0
‘ and in fact , the @entity75 will oppose the @entity77 after 2014			0
’ he went on to warn that @entity11 may need to send more troops to @entity80 province , where @entity8 forces are currently stationed , if extremists seize ground vacated by the allies			2
round table : mr @entity17 is seen speaking on - screen at the meeting yesterday , which was designed to set out a final timetable for the handover to @entity1 security forces , which will lead all combat operations by mid- 2013 mr @entity9 insisted that @entity8 troops will have completed their mission and can leave ‘ with their heads held high ’ – but he conceded that @entity98 leaders would not control the country ’s fate			1
‘ @entity8 troops will no longer be in a combat role beyond the end of 2014 , ’ he said			2
‘ that is our deadline			0
and at this summit , @entity11 confirmed it will be the deadline for the @entity108 [ @entity108 ] mission			0
the plan for the transition of full security responsibility from @entity108 to the @entity77 is on track and on target			2
’ war torn country : @entity1 security forces rush to the site of a battle in @entity118			1
even if the withdrawal goes to plan , @entity8 taxpayers will bankroll the @entity1 security forces for years to come but he added : ‘ there will still be occasions when we are in a combat mode before the end of 2014			1
it ’s very important to make that point to people			0
‘ what is absolutely within our control is the growth of the @entity77 , the capability they have			0
clearly there will be a better outcome in @entity1 if that is accompanied by a political solution as well			2
that is not fully within our control			0
‘ but i am confident that our troops can leave with their heads held high having completed the combat task in 2014 , because they will be handing over to fully capable @entity1 security forces that will be able to deal with any residual problems and issues in a fully capable way			2
they will have done a great job			0
’ unrest : hundreds of protesters , many affiliated with the @entity149 movement , demonstrate in front of the @entity152 headquarters on the second day of the @entity22 summit yesterday even if the withdrawal goes to plan , @entity8 taxpayers will bankroll the @entity1 security forces for years to come , starting with a handout of £ 70million in 2015			1
yesterday ’s summit saw countries pledge £ 2.2billion in total , with @entity8 set to fund an officer training centre dubbed @entity160 in the @entity161			2
a @entity8 source claimed the cost to taxpayers would decline over time			2
‘ long - term @entity166 projections suggest the @entity1 wo n’t be able to be self - funding until the mid- 2020s , but we expect the amount required to fall as the @entity1 state continues to develop , ’ they said			0
‘ the @entity8 ’s contribution will be reviewed after the first year			0
this is about ensuring that the @entity1 are able to manage their own security once we leave			0

' the @entity1 war as we know it is over , ' declares president @entity17
@entity181 concurs , saying plans for withdrawal are ' on track and on target '
