schools are being urged to go back to ‘ chalk and talk ’ teaching that was once widespread in @entity3 – in order to reproduce the success the traditional methods now have in @entity7			1
education minister @entity8 said having a teacher speak to the class as a whole from the front was much more effective than children working on their own – the method which has become dominant in schools over the past 40 years			1
mr @entity8 ’s intervention , which will infuriate many in the educational establishment , follows a @entity20 scheme in which more than 70 maths teachers from @entity3 primaries went to @entity23 to study the teaching styles of their @entity7 counterparts			1
education minister @entity8 has said having a teacher speak to the class from the front was more effective researchers have found that children in @entity7 achieve marks in maths up to 30 per cent higher than @entity33 pupils of the same age			1
in ‘ whole class ’ teaching , which was common in this country until the 1950s , the teacher instructs all the pupils together by using a blackboard , or its equivalent , while testing the children with questions			1
but progressive educationalists argued this was too authoritarian , and instead promoted the ‘ child - centred ’ approach that has been prevalent in primary schools since then			0
under this system , pupils are encouraged to ‘ discover ’ knowledge by themselves , working at their own speed or in small groups , with the teacher offering them support			0
mr @entity8 told @entity55 : ‘ i would like to see schools across the country adopt whole class teaching methods , particularly in maths and science			1
research shows it is significantly more effective than other methods that concentrate more on personalised learning			0
’ he said @entity23 schools topped international league tables , with 15 - year - olds there three years ahead of their @entity33 counterparts in maths			0
mr @entity8 added : ‘ in @entity23 primary schools , whole class teaching with all pupils taking part in question and answer sessions is key to their success			1
all their pupils are taught the same curriculum and all are expected to reach the same high standard			0
’ in ‘ whole class ’ teaching , which was common in this country until the 1950s , the teacher instructs all the pupils together by using a blackboard , or its equivalent , while testing the children with questions professor @entity89 , director of the @entity90 at @entity91 , said : ‘ @entity33 education was overtaken with progressive ideas in recent decades , which held it was better for children to learn by themselves and at their own pace			1
‘ this was clearly madness , and it has taken 40 years to realise this			0
‘ the trouble with the trendy methods is that the children are left to their own devices , including chatting to their friends , while the teacher is elsewhere			0
it is a very inefficient use of time and resources			0
’ mr @entity8 ’s comments have been backed by recent research , which concluded that the success of pupils in the @entity113 is largely down to teaching methods			2
@entity116 tests taken by 562 nine and ten - year - olds in classrooms in @entity119 and @entity120 in @entity7 found that the @entity7 pupils scored between 20 and 30 per cent higher than the @entity33 youngsters			2
classes in @entity33 , where pupils are often grouped in desk clusters , spent nearly half of their time in ' individual group work ' compared with 28 per cent of those in @entity7 , research revealed researchers also used video to analyse what was going on in lessons and found that in the @entity7 classrooms – where pupils sit in rows of desks facing the front – ‘ whole class interaction ’ was being used 72 per cent of the time , compared with only 24 per cent in @entity33			2
by contrast , the classes in @entity33 , where pupils are often grouped in clusters of desks , spent nearly half – 47 per cent – of their time in ‘ individual or group work ’ , compared with 28 per cent in @entity7			2
the research , by @entity148 and professor @entity149 of the @entity150 , concluded : ‘ effective teachers spent longer time on interacting with the whole class rather than with individuals / groups or leaving pupils to independent seatwork			2
’ prof @entity149 said he was disappointed that more schools were not increasing their use of the ‘ whole class ’ approach as it would improve results in most subjects .			0

education minister @entity8 said ' whole class teaching ' is more effective
it involves the teacher instructing all pupils together using blackboard
remarks follow scheme which saw teachers from @entity3 visit @entity23
researchers have found children in @entity7 achieve 30 *%* higher marks
method was used in @entity3 until ' 50s when it was *deemed* too authoritarian
