with a storyline centred on the class divide , it was acclaimed as the novel which showed @entity4 could address adult issues as well as she could weave magic for children in the @entity9 books			1
but now the @entity10 has come under fire over its adaptation of her novel @entity12 just weeks before the @entity15			1
the broadcaster has been accused of ramping up left - wing issues in the book – by adding scenes which do not even appear in the novel			1
controversy : the @entity10 has come under fire over its adaptation of @entity4 's novel @entity12 just weeks before the @entity15 the three - part drama , which starts next sunday and stars sir @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , paints a bleak picture of life in modern @entity31 and features storylines involving rape , drug abuse and racism			1
set in the fictitious @entity38 town of @entity39 , it features a community of rich and poor at war over the future of a community centre called @entity44 , home to social services including a drug rehabilitation centre and a food bank			0
@entity50 ’s wealthier residents , who are fed up with the centre being a haven for ‘ junkies and plebs ’ from a nearby council estate called @entity56 , want to close it for good and turn it into a luxury hotel and spa			2
they are bitterly opposed by the liberal faction on @entity39 parish council who believe it is essential for social cohesion			0
@entity67 mp and former foreign secretary sir @entity68 said the timing of the broadcast struck him as being ‘ very odd at least ’			0
he said : ‘ in the run - up to a general election , the government quite rightly has to go into purdah and refrain from doing anything provocative			1
i think the @entity10 should have to apply the same criteria			1
’ the drama does not mention any political parties but critics say the battle over @entity44 is a thinly disguised attack on the government ’s welfare cuts , which will be one of the crucial issues for the may 7 election			1
in an interview in @entity88 , @entity4 defended herself against accusations that her novel was a left - wing attack on the middle classes			1
she said : ‘ i ’m not anti-middle class in the slightest			0
adaptation : the three - part drama , which starts next sunday and stars sir @entity26 ( left ) paints a bleak picture of life in modern @entity31 and features storylines involving rape , drug abuse and racism ' look at me ! i am very pro people putting time and money and effort into trying to improve the world			1
and the middle classes do that very , very well			0
scene 1 the @entity10 : in the opening scenes , councillor @entity111 , played by sir @entity26 , and his social - climbing wife @entity112 ( @entity113 ) discuss plans for a luxury hotel and spa development			1
a gleeful @entity112 tells her husband : ‘ it ’s beautiful			2
you feel better just looking at it			0
you ca n’t let @entity122 and his tribe of do - gooders stand in the way of progress			2
they ’ll have to accept that @entity44 has had its day			0
’ in the novel : the plan for a luxury hotel and spa does not appear at all			0
scene 2 the @entity10 : opposing the plans , councillor @entity122 says : ‘ that is social engineering			1
herding people into ghettos because they do n’t fit the aesthetic			0
there is a name for that , is n’t there			0
@entity142 , you stormed the @entity147 beaches did n’t you , fighting fascism ... that house helps people to live			0
the parish council is not here to make a quick buck for someone who already has more than enough ... is the legacy still of benefit ? yes			0
it has never been so important			0
’ in the novel : councillor @entity122 dies on page two having hardly uttered a word			0
scene 3 the @entity10 : when progressive councillor @entity159 tells her colleagues that drug addicts will have to travel to nearby @entity162 to get help , a rival tells her : ‘ they would crawl on their knees over broken glass if there were drugs to be had			1
’ in the novel : she uses far milder language , saying addicts should have their benefits cut			0
' i would be the last person to deny that , being middle class myself			0
’ @entity10 publicity states the drama is about ‘ a town at war , rich at war with poor , teenagers at war with their parents , wives at war with their husbands , teachers at war with their pupils ’			1
the @entity10 adaptation also contains several explosive scenes not included in the novel			1
councillor @entity122 dies in the first two pages of the book , but in the screenplay he lives long enough in the show to liken the closure of @entity44 to ‘ fascism ’ and ‘ apartheid ’			2
@entity10 guidelines state that dramas which deal with controversial subjects should be flagged up in advance and that on occasion it may be appropriate to offer alternative views in other ‘ signposted ’ output			2
@entity67 mp @entity206 , a member of the @entity207 , said : ‘ this drama does appear to be sailing very close to the wind			2
‘ it wo n’t be the first time the @entity10 has shown this kind of bias in its drama output			1
’ broadcaster @entity215 defended the @entity10 ’s right to adapt the work of a novelist who he insisted was partisan and political in the same way as @entity220			1
the @entity222 peer said : ‘ this is a political novel in the sense that it is addressing what happens when society cuts off those people who they think are inadequate			2
’ @entity229 , who wrote the screen adaptation , said : ‘ the story is less about party politics and more about community			2
' it ’s a great rallying call for humanitarianism and to see ourselves as absolutely connected and linked to each other			0
’ the @entity10 defended the timing , saying rules governing what could be broadcast before an election kicked in on march 30			2
a spokesman said : ' @entity243 is proud to bring @entity4 's global best - seller and first novel for adults - from one of @entity31 's most popular authors - to the screen			1
