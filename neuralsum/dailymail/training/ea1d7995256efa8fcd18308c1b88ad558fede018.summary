by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:22 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 06:59 est , 3 june 2013 police commissioners , free schools and winter fuel cash for rich pensioners could be scrapped by a @entity9 government , @entity3 revealed today			1
in a major speech setting out where the axe would fall after the next election , the shadow chancellor admitted for the first time that his party would have to continue cutting @entity16 budgets after 2015			1
mr @entity3 also suggested scrapping whole government departments and agencies , as he warned the @entity9 it had to get used to the idea that there would be no money			1
cuts : shadow chancellor @entity3 warned the @entity9 that it could not expect increasing public spending after the 2015 election the @entity9 is to launch a major drive this week to address real fears among voters that mr @entity3 , and leader @entity28 , can not be trusted with the economy			1
next month chancellor @entity30 will set out the coalition 's spending plans for 2015 - 16 , the financial year after the general election			1
mr @entity3 signalled that @entity9 would take the coalition 's 2015 - 16 spending review as a " ' starting point ' with money ' switched ' to @entity9 's priorities			1
he suggested that @entity9 would ditch plans by education secretary @entity41 to build more free schools , abolish the police commissioners which were elected for the first time last year and scrap the winter fuel allowance for wealthy pensioners			2
mr @entity3 said the party had to ask ' important ' questions when drawing up its manifesto			0
' with primary school places in short supply in many parts of the country , and parents struggling to get their children into a local school , can it really be a priority to open more free schools in 2015 and 2016 in areas with excess secondary school places ? ' when we are losing thousands of police officers and police staff , how have we ended up spending more on police commissioners than the old police authorities , with more elections currently timetabled for 2016 ? ' with family budgets under such pressure and living standards falling , surely it makes sense to introduce a mansion tax on properties worth over £ 2m to pay for a lower 10p starting rate of tax ? ' and when our @entity80 and social care system is under such pressure , can it really remain a priority to pay the @entity87 - a vital support for middle and low income pensioners - to the richest 5 per cent of pensioners , those with incomes high enough to pay the higher or top rates of tax ? ' tough : mr @entity93 ' speech at @entity94 in @entity95 today is seen as an attempt to persuade voters to trust @entity9 with the economy again more than 600,000 better - off pensioners would lose their winter fuel payments the plan			1
in a speech at the @entity104 headquarters of news agency @entity94 , mr @entity3 said the next @entity9 government would need to show ' iron discipline ' and a ' relentless focus '			2
his revelation that @entity9 would take away cold weather payments is a rare declaration of a policy which would follow an election victory			2
the benefit is worth between £ 200 and £ 300 a year for richer oaps who pay higher and top rate income tax – about one in 20			0
the plans would only raise about £ 105million a year , less than half of 1 per cent of the welfare budget			0
but the move will put @entity120 in an awkward position since the prime minister has promised not to cut pensioner benefits			0
polls show the public wants to see wealthy pensioners lose their perks while the @entity128 have repeatedly called for winter fuel allowance to be cut or taxed			0
mr @entity3 says that richer pensioners should shoulder their share of the cuts			0
but @entity133 , a former labour cabinet minister , said the move was a slippery slope which will save peanuts ' and raise questions about meanstesting other benefits including tv licences , bus passes and senior rail cards			0
mr @entity133 wrote in an article for @entity143 : ' if middle @entity144 ceased to benefit from the welfare state through some of the few universal benefits that are left , how can we convince them to fund the larger part of that budget through their taxes ? ' balls accused chancellor of the exchequer @entity30 ( pictured ) of ' economic failure ' , he will say that @entity9 has to prepare for straitened times mr @entity3 added : ' @entity9 believes the allowance provides vital support for pensioners on middle and low incomes to combat fuel poverty			1
that 's why we introduced it in the first place			0
' but , at a time when the public services that pensioners and others rely on are under strain , it can no longer be a priority to continue paying the allowance to the wealthiest pensioners			0
' but last night the @entity173 stressed that mr @entity3 ' plans would cost millions to implement , slashing the savings to well under £ 100million a year			0
they also pointed to demands in his speech for higher spending on infrastructure projects as proof that @entity9 would continue to borrow more , driving up @entity144 's deficit			1
the declaration will come in the most significant speech for two years by mr @entity3			0
treasury minister @entity185 he warned that if his party wins the 2015 election , it will have to be ' a very different kind of @entity9 government to those which have gone before '			1
accusing chancellor @entity30 of ' economic failure ' , he said that @entity9 has to prepare for straitened times			1
he said : ' this is the hard reality			0
the last @entity9 government was able to plan its 1997 manifesto on the basis of rising spending in the first years after the election			2
' the next @entity9 government will have to plan on the basis of falling spending			2
@entity28 and i know that , and my shadow cabinet colleagues know that too			0
' @entity9 must start planning now for what will be a very tough inheritance in 2015			1
it will require us to govern in a very different way with much less money around			0
' we will need an iron discipline and a relentless focus on our priorities			0
' mr @entity3 pledged to ' set out a clear and balanced plan to support growth , alongside a clear timetable to get the deficit down ' before the election			0
the shadow chancellor also backed calls by the @entity219 for the @entity220 to ' act to boost capital spending over the next two years '			1
this would be ' financed by a temporary rise in borrowing as @entity9 has also urged – to build our way to a stronger recovery '			2
but @entity173 claim that @entity9 pledges made this year alone would raise borrowing by £ 35billion a year			2
treasury minister @entity185 said : ' @entity3 ' promise of discipline on spending is n't remotely credible			0
' @entity3 is incapable of admitting that @entity9 spent and borrowed too much in government , he has opposed every single tough decision we 've taken to cut the deficit and he 's still saying @entity9 would borrow billions more			1
' the same old @entity9 plan for more borrowing and more debt would mean soaring interest rates with hardworking people paying the price			2
' last month @entity9 's deputy leader @entity240 said party chiefs will ' review ' whether to cut pensioner benefits such as free bus passes and tv licences			1
but that admission sparked confusion after a week of u-turns over whether universal benefits were under threat			1
labour leader @entity28 had said he would ' look at ' pensioner benefits before aides raced to say that he supports universal handouts .			2

shadow chancellor admits his party would make cuts after 2015
*concession* launches a week of announcements for *opposition*
but sparks @entity9 *infighting* over end to universal benefits
