by @entity0 @entity2 girl ? a photo of @entity4 taken from her @entity6 page , on which she describes her role as ' assistant to @entity9 ' the advert suggests she is simply an ordinary worker from @entity11 , who will be casting a vote for @entity14 at the @entity16 elections			1
and while @entity4 ’s claim to back @entity9 ’s party ca n’t be questioned , it is not just at the ballot box that she will be putting that support into action			1
it is even doubtful whether she will be voting in the @entity2			2

miss @entity4 appears in a full - page photograph in the party ’s manifesto , with her quoted as saying : ‘ i ’ll be voting @entity14 because they ’re the only party listening to what people want			1
’ but on her @entity6 account the 27 - year - old describes herself as ‘ @entity39 and assistant to @entity9 , as well as a lover of social occasions ’			1
the photograph adorning her @entity6 page shows her sitting next to mr @entity9 , her arm draped behind him in a @entity14 group picture taken in a pub ; to her right is blonde @entity48 , head of media for @entity14 , and the party ’s leader , who sits alongside @entity52 , its director of communications			1

promotional material : miss @entity4 in the recently published @entity14 leaflet where she poses as a worker from @entity11 when miss @entity4 ’s true identity was exposed and her role in the advert questioned , mr @entity9 , 50 , said : ‘ i do n’t think you ’d ask this question of the @entity70 , the @entity84 or the @entity85 who often have group pictures			1
‘ you know , the leader with 25 people standing behind them			0
and you never ask to see the cv of any of those , ’ he told @entity88			0
he added : ‘ the fact that @entity4 is half - @entity95 and works for us is as far as we are concerned a non-issue			2
‘ she is somebody in our promotional material who is going to vote @entity14			2
‘ she joined @entity14 , she got a job with @entity14 because she believes in what we stand for			0
what on earth is wrong with that ? ’ asked why miss @entity4 is not described as a @entity14 staff member in the manifesto , mr @entity9 replied : ‘ i do n’t see the need			1
