by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 7 june 2013 a council has been forced to pay a former school technician more than £ 100,000 after colleagues fashioned male genitalia from @entity5 and stuck them to her telephone			1
male staff at @entity9 in @entity10 also scrawled pictures of penises on drawings devout @entity14 , 56 , had done for her @entity16 pack during a ' shameful ' campaign of sexual harassment			1
an employment tribunal in the city also heard that they used ' coarse industrial language ' directly in front of miss @entity24 , who they were aware was deeply religious , and that they regularly baited her			2
devout : @entity26 @entity24 , 56 , was subjected to harassment of an ' obscene and shameful nature ' by male colleagues at @entity9 in @entity10 , a tribunal heard the tribunal ruled that the behaviour of three of miss @entity24 's male colleagues was ' of an obscene and shameful nature ' , after several episodes dating back from 2001 were recounted at the hearing			1
a judgement published yesterday found miss @entity24 had been subjected to ' serious ' sexual harassment over a period of several months			1
the tribunal ruled she should be awarded damages from @entity42			1
the tribunal was told about another episode with a slogan to do with a @entity47 player from 2001			2
the judgment published yesterday said a male colleague wrote on a noticeboard ' @entity51 is @entity52 ' in a reference to the @entity55 footballer @entity51 , who signed for @entity47 in 2000			2
when she saw it , miss @entity24 changed ' @entity52 ' to ' good ' but the male colleague changed it back			2
according to the judgement , miss @entity24 's colleagues ' decided to conduct a planned campaign of obscene behaviour against miss @entity24 because they considered that she was a vulnerable individual who was very naive sexually and a devout @entity26 ' / the judgement added : ' it was sexual harassment of a serious kind and went on for seven or eight months			1
' the tribunal ruled that miss @entity24 should receive £ 25,000 from @entity42 for the injury to her feelings , and remarked that - although she had complained on several occasions to her superior - no satisfactory action was taken by the authority to ensure there was no repeat of the obscene behaviour by the three men			1
the council was also ordered to pay her £ 12,500 for psychiatric injury and £ 25,603 for loss of earnings			0
the sums amount to £ 63,103 and the tribunal ruled that she should also receive interest at 8 per cent from as far back as 2001 - plus a sum for loss of pension rights			0
this puts the total at more than £ 100,000			0
' @entity89 and complicated ' : miss @entity24 left her position as a school technician at @entity9 in 2002 the council accepted that they owed compensation to miss @entity24 for the unlawful and ' plainly shameful ' conduct of their employees between may and december 2001			2
miss @entity24 's case has a long history and was returned to the tribunal from the @entity99 in @entity100 , where a judge said the time and expense involved in @entity24 's row with @entity42 was ' staggering '			1
the judge @entity105 called for a deal to be reached and chronicled the ' long and complicated saga ' which an employment appeals tribunal had described as ' a mess '			0
miss @entity24 left her job early in 2002 and in april of that year she went to an employment tribunal alleging sexual harassment by fellow employees and blamed the local authority			1
after a legal row about whether she had waited too long before going to the tribunal , a series of hearings went ahead but in april 2003 her claims were dismissed			0
although the tribunal accepted that the harassment had happened , they ruled that the council was not ' vicariously liable '			0
in march 2004 the decision was reversed after it was revealed that one of the tribunal members , ill at the time , had fallen asleep			0
a fresh tribunal heard the case again between march 2005 and november 2006 , and there were further hearings in each of the next three years before the case arrived at @entity134 's highest civil court			0
in sending the case back , lord @entity14 expressed concern that the long and expensive saga had occurred in a system which was supposed to improve efficiency and cut costs			0
a spokesman for @entity42 said today : ' we are studying the details of the judgement thoroughly			0

@entity24 suffered ' serious ' sexual harassment from male colleagues
staff at @entity47 's @entity9 scrawled male genitalia on her *artwork*
devout @entity26 complained to her superiors but no action was taken
@entity154 ruled she should receive damages from @entity42
