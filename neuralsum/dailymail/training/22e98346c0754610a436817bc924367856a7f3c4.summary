@entity0 has questioned @entity2 's transfer policy this summer following their opening day @entity4 defeat at home to @entity7			1
@entity2 have made two signings in @entity9 and @entity10 but @entity0 insists the club should have done better in recruiting more talent to @entity13			0
speaking as pundit on @entity17 , the @entity15 legend insisted @entity19 's side lack of midfield quality was to blame for their 2 - 1 defeat to the @entity23			1
@entity9 started saturday 's encounter but @entity0 is worried @entity2 may not attract the quality of players in the middle of the park who can supply captain @entity58 and co up front before the transfer window closes on september 1			2
talent : @entity9 ( left ) made his @entity2 debut in their @entity4 defeat to @entity7 ' we need more players , ' @entity0 said			2
' they miss the likes of [ @entity70 ] @entity69 , [ @entity72 ] @entity71 , @entity73 [ @entity73 ] and you saw they were inexperienced and got caught			0
' but the big thing for me was the quality just was n’t there in the midfield			0
' [ @entity58 ] @entity58 and [ @entity82 ] @entity81 could n't feed off anything			0
they looked better in the first 20 minutes of the second half and when @entity2 got the goal you expected them to kick on and get the crowd going but you didnt see it coming			0
' the big thing about @entity19 spending big money now is – who comes in ? is the quality there ? the two big players have n’t come – @entity96 and @entity40			0
' on the ball : @entity41 left @entity98 to join @entity49 winners @entity48 @entity100 is the colour : @entity40 ( centre ) swapped @entity103 for @entity45 in a £ 30million deal @entity0 also questioned @entity24 's decision to employ a 3 - 5 - 2 formation at @entity13 , where @entity2 's teams have traditionally played more orthodox 4 - 4 - 2 formations			1
he said : ' when you look at @entity2 the last 20 years its been 4 - 4 - 2 or 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 and that where we had all our success			2
3 - 5 - 2 may be some @entity114 is a little obsessed with because it worked in the @entity115 for him – there ’s no doubt about that			1
' but this crowd need a little bit of excitement and for me 3 - 5 - 2 is not a boring way of playing but it is a very slow way of playing , all about possession rather than having that thrust and ability to score goals			1

@entity0 questions @entity2 transfer policy
@entity0 says @entity2 lack of midfield quality was exposed in @entity7 defeat
@entity0 *believes* club should have bought @entity40 or @entity96
*ex-england* star also wonders whether 3 - 5 - 2 formation is best for @entity2
@entity0 says @entity24 's formation is ' slow way of playing ' that ' lacks thrust '
