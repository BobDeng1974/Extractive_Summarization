@entity0 does not want to sack @entity1			1
he does not want to suffer the financial trauma of changing managers			1
@entity0 , however , does not want to be relegated			1
likewise , he does not want to suffer the financial trauma of that sorry scenario ( again )			1
@entity1 has come under fan pressure following a poor start to the season but has the players ' support @entity0 does not want to sack @entity1 and would be content to finish fourth from bottom in the league to that end , if a mystic @entity14 were to fly by the owner ’s helicopter and reveal that , under @entity1 , @entity13 would finish fourth from bottom , he would remain in charge			1
it ’s a numbers game with @entity0 - check his bank balance and you ’ll see why			1
he is divorced from sentiment , stung - emotionally and financially - by agreeing to the return of @entity26 @entity25 in 2009			2
so if @entity1 , then , can guarantee @entity13 ’s @entity29 status and the cash bonanza to which survival equates , he will be ok by his paymaster			1
@entity0 was stung following the return of @entity26 @entity25 in 2009 but would @entity1 be happy with such an eventuality ? a fortnight ago , on the eve of the home game with @entity36 , he held court with journalists at the club ’s training ground , convincing us – and perhaps himself – that his was a cause worth fighting for			1
there was off the record , on the record , gusto and guts			2
in the subsequent match , his team were equally spirited , rallying to recover a two - goal deficit and claim a point			2
four days later there was the @entity54 win at @entity55			0
relief ? or merely a temporary reprieve ? his demeanour in the wake of monday ’s 1 - 0 defeat at @entity62 suggests the latter			0
for the first time , he looked like a man in need of a break			0
he has not lost the dressing room			0
on the contrary , senior players remain in support of their boss , both privately and publicly			0
@entity1 still has the support of his players and the owner , but the fans are clear that they want him to go fans hold up signs calling for @entity1 to be sacked as @entity13 lost again at @entity62 on monday night if anything , though , that is something of a concern			1
for had there been discord behind the scenes , a change of coach could well trigger an improvement			0
but this lot – and you suspect @entity1 knows this – simply are n’t good enough			2
this is a team without invention , identity , energy or endeavour , and for that he is in part culpable			0
but the manager does not have autonomy on transfers – far from it – and has been denied a goalscorer , the one commodity which masks the failings of others			2
he can not speak out against the club ’s transfer policy and the modus operandi of their soccermarket sweep of the continental aisle			0
now that would be a sackable offence			0
@entity113 's headed goal , which earned @entity62 a 1 - 0 win on monday , put yet more pressure on @entity13 instead , he has offered a whole host of reasons as to the team ’s shortcomings in recent seasons – hence the now familiar chant , ‘ @entity1 , it ’s never your fault ’			1
but perhaps now he ’s had enough of it all – hands tied in transfer dealings , supporter unrest and venom hissed in his direction , no ambition from above and a squad which , no matter the man in charge , will lurk in dangerous waters until january at least			0
does he attempt to paddle through until then ? or is he resigned to being taken by the current which runs against him ? either way , he will not abandon the liferaft to which he currently clings			0
but were @entity0 to blow him out of the water , you get the impression it would save the manager from drowning			1
perhaps now it is for the best .			0

@entity0 does not want to sack @entity1
however , the @entity13 owner does not want to be relegated but does not want to suffer financial trauma by sacking another manager
@entity13 have started season poorly and are in the relegation zone
