by @entity0 published : 15:49 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 05:29 est , 7 february 2013 dilapidated , dirty , mouldy , strewn with rubble and with boarded - up windows , these frightening shacks are still selling for an amazing half a million dollars - or more			1
all of the properties are in the wealthy and exclusive @entity6 of @entity7 , which may go some way to explaining the astoundingly high price , despite a crash in property values in the region as a result of a real estate crash that began in 2009			1
they were collected on @entity16 by blogger @entity17 , who writes for @entity18 , a site that gives tips on finance and living frugally , who also lives in the area			1
dilapidated and foreboding shacks like this are selling for half a million dollars or more in @entity6 although this is just the garage of the $ 600,000 property in @entity29 , the actual house is more than a bit run - down too many of the for - sale fixer - uppers are so foreboding they look like they would suit a ( very rich ) serial killer			1
handily , they may already have the power tools necessary to refurbish the site			1
one shack , listed at $ 1.35million , is in @entity37 and comes with more than three acres , which probably explains the price			2
mrs @entity17 compared it to the hotel featured in cult horror @entity43 , featuring @entity44 as a writer sent murderously insane by the @entity46			2
' the listing is full of creepy pictures at odd angles , ' she wrote			1
' and the address ? 19366 overlook road			2
welcome to @entity51 ! all work and no play makes @entity44 a dull boy			2
' this @entity56 shack was sold for $ 500,000			0
the listing describes it as ' frankly uninhabitable ' this $ 1.35million @entity37 shack ( left ) comes with more than three acres			0
a bargain , if buyers can bring themselves to approach the foreboding structure			0
the listing for the $ 505,000 @entity65 shack ( right ) recommends : ' bring a contractor with you ' welcome home : the shack in @entity37 is seen lined with tossed tree stumps with mulch paving the way to the front door view : the shack in @entity37 comes with more than three acres , seen here overlooking its backyard which earns its high value thanks to its view overlooking the ocean fixer upper : the yard could easily be cleared out and redesigned to accommodate visual access to its view said to overlook water shack with a view : one of the shacks boats panoramic views that features the @entity6 , the @entity85 pictured stretching across it ( file photo ) another secluded property is pictured with a yard covered in rusty machinery and tools and broken , dirty lawn equipment , perfect for those who require privacy			1
and somewhere screams wo n't carry			0
it 's yours for $ 1.8million			0
why so much ? mrs @entity17 has the answer : ' there is an explanation : according to the listing , the lot is one mile from the planned new @entity103 headquarters			0
' the location of one shack , which boasts panoramic views of the picturesque @entity6 , is so desirable the sellers were incredibly frank about its condition in their listing			1
it said : ' frankly uninhabitable , with two bedrooms and a bath but no kitchen			0
' it was snapped up for a cool $ 500,000 earlier this year			0
nearly $ 2million for a house like this ? it is just one mile from the planned new @entity103 headquarters ... it may look like a western cattle ranch after it was torched by outlaws but the property , and more importantly its land , is worth $ 1.275million			0

creepy and shabby properties are selling for at least half a million dollars
they are in the desirable @entity6
yet many look like the perfect abode for an *investment* - savvy *psychopath*
