@entity0 has eased @entity1 fears that he is unhappy at @entity2 with a vow to improve next season and help the club become champions of @entity7 once again			1
the @entity9 winger also admitted that manager @entity10 had been right to drive him hard and demand more from him			1
' it ’s true and it ’s good , ' said @entity0			1
' i prefer it when we speak like this , rather than saying things like : " he ’s the best and he does n’t need to work "			0
' hazard , @entity1 ’s 17 - goal top scorer , was voted @entity20 but tired towards the end of the season			1
his last four goals were all from the penalty spot and he has not scored from open play since early february			0
i must do better : @entity0 says that @entity10 was right to criticise him in recent weeks hard work ? @entity10 accused @entity0 of not sacrificing himself to the team against @entity28 his failure to track back and defend was also criticised in the @entity31 semi-final defeat against @entity28 , prompting @entity10 to say the 23 - year - old was not ready to ' sacrifice ' himself for the team			1
' i know maybe i have to do better in training or on the pitch , ' said @entity0 , in an interview with the @entity1 magazine			1
' i want to score more and help the team score more goals and next season i hope we can be better			2
' i try to play like i did when i was a young boy playing in my garden			0
sometimes it ’s good , sometimes it ’s not so good but i try to always make sure i give my best to help the team , even if i am not having the best game myself			0
' when you are young , you sometimes play one good game and then one bad game			0
this season i was able to be more consistent which is good for me			2
' @entity53 man : hazard was happy he was able to add consistency to his game this year deserved : the @entity9 was named @entity1 's @entity20 , as well as the @entity20 's @entity57 deserved : the @entity9 was named @entity1 's @entity20 , as well as the @entity20 's @entity57 @entity1 reached the last four of the @entity31 and finished third in the @entity59 , four points behind champions @entity61 , and @entity10 knows @entity0 has the speed and talent to propel this team to a higher level			1
' this season we did n’t win any trophies but we were back in the @entity31 , ' said the @entity9			1
' for a young player like me it is good to play for a club that can get to the semi-finals , because one of the reasons i play football is for these big games			0
' this season was an ‘ almost ’ season – almost getting to the @entity31 final , almost champions in the @entity59			2
next season , with this team , we can win the @entity59 and maybe the @entity31			0
' individually i am very happy because i can play in every game , i can be on the pitch and do what i like to do , which is play football			0
it was a good season for me but , as the boss says , we finished third and i hope next season we finish first			0
i always want to score more goals and improve , that is a big objective			0
