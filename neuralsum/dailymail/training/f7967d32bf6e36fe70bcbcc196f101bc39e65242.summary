by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 05:59 est , 14 november 2012 traitor : @entity2 was caught by @entity3 trying to leak to the @entity4 and now faces jail grinning as he poses with a rifle in his hands , this is the embittered @entity9 officer facing jail for trying to betray his country			1
@entity2 , 30 , offered sensitive military information to two men he believed to be @entity4 spies			1
the petty officer boasted that he had secret details of the movements of nuclear submarines and the workings of a device used to encrypt coded messages			2
but the pair were really @entity25 agents who were covertly recording the meeting – and @entity2 , who had vowed to ' hurt ' the @entity9 after a promotion was scrapped due to budget cuts , was arrested soon afterwards			1
at the @entity29 in @entity30 yesterday , he pleaded guilty to amassing information in breach of the @entity33 between last november and this march , and misconduct in a public office			1
he faces up to 14 years in jail when sentenced next month			2
the court heard that as well as offering the supposed spies details of an enigma - style ' cryptography ' device used for coded messages , @entity2 also offered secret information about the movements of two submarines carrying nuclear missiles			1
the case raises worrying questions about @entity9 vetting procedures given @entity2 's history			2
in the months leading up to his arrest in march , he had been posting up to 40 messages a day on @entity50 discussing his submarine and his anti-government views			0
in addition , two years ago he had gone on trial for raping a young woman with learning difficulties			0
although he was cleared , the court heard seedy details of his personal life , which involved him betraying girlfriend @entity60 to have a threesome with two other women , and having sex with the alleged rape victim while on aphrodisiac drug amyl nitrate , or ' poppers ' – use of which is a dismissable offence in the services			0
enemy : petty officer @entity2 holding a gun and was offering military secrets to an ' enemy ' foreign embassy in @entity30 representatives of the @entity9 had looked on at the rape trial as @entity2 's own lawyer called him a ' cad and a chancer '			1
@entity2 , the son of a warehouseman from @entity80 in @entity81 , joined the @entity9 as a school - leaver , rising to petty officer			1
he was then sponsored to study for a degree in electronic engineering , before winning a place on a course to become a commissioned officer			0
it was during a study period in 2009 , while living with girlfriend @entity90 , 27 , an emergency ward nurse , in @entity91 , that he was charged with rape			0
@entity2 with partner @entity60 , who it is believed is standing by him scandal : @entity2 was filmed by @entity3 trying to give away tightly - held @entity25 secrets to two fake @entity4 agents @entity2 admitted having casual sex three times with his accuser , whose learning difficulties were so great she struggled giving evidence			1
the jury cleared him of rape			0
after being cleared , @entity2 went straight back to work , first on hunter killer submarine @entity107 , and then on @entity108 , which carries nuclear missiles			1
he developed a grudge , however , when told that budget cuts had ended his chances of becoming a commissioned officer			0
november 2011 : @entity2 approaches foreign embassy and offers top secret information december 2011 - january 2012 : @entity2 has series of text and phone conversations with who he believed were @entity4 spies - they were in fact from @entity3 january 28 2012 : a meeting is set up by @entity3 where the submariner offers information to two men pretending to be @entity4 and is recorded doing so march 2012 : @entity2 is arrested and appears in court denying the charges because he said what he was offering was not top secret november 2012 : the 30 - year - old changes his plea and admits two charges and denies another , which is dropped december 12 2012 : he will be sentenced last november , he attempted to contact the @entity4 embassy – but it was undercover @entity25 agents who arranged to meet him in @entity30 in january			1
at an earlier hearing , prosecutor @entity138 said : ' he gave them information about his submarine including maintenance periods , refitting work and firing test missiles			2
' he also told them about sailing dates and destinations			0
' @entity2 , who has admitted travelling overseas without informing superiors as required , had been a heavy drinker and was considered a suicide risk			2
he has been in custody since his march arrest			0
his defence barrister , lord @entity154 , claimed at the earlier hearing that his client had been depressed since his rape trial and the ' secret ' information was worthless			2
but an intelligence source said @entity2 's leaks could have been passed from @entity4 to @entity160 , focusing on secret submarine manoeuvres in the @entity162			1
last night a @entity9 source told the @entity164 : ' @entity2 was a bit of a @entity167 character , a dreamer			2
we were keeping a very close eye on him			0
the operation to establish exactly what he was doing was going on well in advance of the secret service sting			0
' a @entity175 spokesman refused to discuss the case			0
miss @entity60 also declined to comment but is understood to be continuing to stand by him			0
hidden : @entity2 covers himself up as he arrives at @entity178 earlier this year and he will be sentenced next month			1

@entity2 was filmed trying to leak sensitive information by @entity181
he thought he was meeting @entity4 spies but it was really @entity3
the 30 - year - old offered code - breaking secrets and data about submarine movements
@entity2 was *vengeful* because the navy had cancelled his degree course but also had been drinking heavily and was depressed
he will be sentenced next month after admitting breaching @entity33
