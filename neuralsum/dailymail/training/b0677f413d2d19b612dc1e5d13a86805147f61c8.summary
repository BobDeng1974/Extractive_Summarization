by @entity0 ancient forest : logs and stumps can be seen underneath the thawing 37 square mile @entity5 in @entity6 , with some of the trees still bearing roots and bark an ancient forest which is thought to have been hidden for at least 1,000 years has been discovered beneath a melting glacier			1
logs and stumps can be seen underneath the thawing 37 square mile @entity5 in @entity6 , with some of the trees still bearing roots and bark			1
remnants of the forest have been protruding from the river of ice , which flows into a lake near the city of @entity21 for around five decades			0
but scientists from the nearby @entity23 have noticed more tree stumps popping up in the past year			1
the researchers are particularly excited about the discovery because most of the trees are so well preserved with some still in their upright position			2
the forest is said to have been shielded from the ice by a tomb of gravel which most likely encased the forest as initial carbon dating tests suggest that the gravel tomb , which is around 5ft high , may have been formed at least 1,000 years ago			0
as glaciers develop they often emit summer meltwater streams which produce aprons of gravel			0
@entity41 , a professor at the university , told @entity43 : ' there are a lot of them , and being in a growth position is exciting because we can see the outermost part of the tree and count back to see how old the tree was			2
' mostly , people find chunks of wood helter - skelter , but to see these intact upright is kind of cool			0
' the trees are thought to be either spruce or hemlock , based on the size of the trunks and existing vegetation in the area			1
but while the find has excited scientists , locals are concerned about the prospect of glacial melting			0
they are worried about the threat of rising sea levels and the loss of freshwater sources relied upon for drinking water			0
retreating : the forest has been discovered at the @entity5 , pictured , near @entity21 , @entity6			1

scientists found well preserved tree stumps at @entity5 , @entity6
based on the size of their trunks trees are either hemlock or spruce
