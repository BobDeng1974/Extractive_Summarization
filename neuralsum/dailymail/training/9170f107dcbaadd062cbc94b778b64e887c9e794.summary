' he added : ' these measures were used with the fear and terror they caused , indeed some aspects of the case indicate the activists enjoyed causing such terror			2
' judge @entity76 said : ' i come to a conclusion you are a lady of very good character indeed , if it was n’t for your complete obsession with your cause and an inability to accept its limits within law , there was so much good you have been able to do for other people you have met in your life and for all the animal welfare work you have done			2

' mr @entity153 explained that the actions of @entity24 went beyond the right to protest or freedom of expression			1
