by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 09:15 est , 31 july 2012 it is entirely understandable that when you train so hard for an elusive @entity4 gold but fail at one of the final hurdles , you would be upset - perhaps even inconsolable as the life - long dream turns to dust			1
but this @entity11 athlete may have taken her emotions a little too far after bowing out of the semi-finals of the women 's fencing following one of the most controversial moments of the @entity18 so far			1
fencer @entity19 was in floods of tears at the excel arena after the biggest controversy of the @entity4 so far			2
controversy : @entity19 of @entity11 reacts after losing to @entity25 of @entity26 the 25 - year - old thought she was through to the final of the women ’s epee when , to her horror and that of her coach @entity36 , the clock was reset from zero to one second			1
and when the action resumed @entity26 @entity25 , gold medallist four years ago , scored a do - or - die hit that appeared to have given her a place in the final against @entity43 ’s @entity42			1
the @entity11 coach was incandescent			0
he furiously launched an appeal against the decision that had allowed the fight to continue and it was nearly half an hour before it was announced to the crowd - slow - handicapping by this stage - that @entity25 ’s win stood			2
@entity19 broke down in tears for the second time and while her opponent celebrated she remained on the piste , in what appeared to be a sit - down protest			2
contrasting fortunes : @entity19 was in floods of tears as @entity25 ( right ) celebrates her win the crowd was then told she was doing that because a formal appeal was being considered and if she left the field of play it would be deemed an acceptance of defeat			2
by then the bronze medal match should have started , but that faced a lengthy delay - as did the final to follow			1
dream over : officials lead the fencer away after her appeal @entity19 only needed to draw the contest in sudden death because she had been given priority - that is , the onus was on @entity25 to score in the extra minute of sudden death			1
the crowd could hardly believe their ears just before 7.40pm - nearly an hour after the incident - when they were told part of the rules was that the @entity88 had to lodge money for the appeal to be valid			0
still @entity19 remained on the piste , bringing back memories of compatriot @entity94 ’s sit - down strike during the boxing in @entity96 in 1988.the big difference was that @entity19 was an innocent in all this and just doing what she was told			0
just before 8pm an official came onto the piste to encourage @entity19 to leave , but she was unwilling to move			0
alone : @entity19 refused to leave after the controversial decision was announced all out for the win : @entity25 ( right ) scores the final point to secure a controversial victory another official came on to assist as she crumbles and burst into tears again			1
the crowd jeered the losing @entity110 as she was escorted from the piste , even though the decision had not been announced			0
as she was hugged by her coach the announcer asked for respect to be shown to the athletes and judges - and also a big round of applause for the world no 12 as she finally left			0
out of luck : @entity19 lost the bronze medal match against @entity124 's @entity123 the coach left as well , still clearly furious about an outcome that the fans had yet to be told about			1
the final should have been staged by then , but the crowd was not able to see what happened next			0
the spectators had no idea what was going on back stage			0
the final decision was that @entity19 had lost the semi-final and was to compete in the bronze medal match			1
amazingly it began a few minutes later , the @entity11 coach saying : ' we will try to clam her down , even though she is to be extremely stressed '			0
a cult hero of sorts , @entity19 somehow summoned up the concentration to take an early 4 - 2 lead over world @entity146 - every hit being roared by her new - found fans			0
with the last three - minute period to go it was 9 - 9 , but @entity19 's agony became complete when @entity152 took the bronze 15 - 11 and she was left empty - handed from a night she and the audience will never forget			2
this morning @entity157 fencing commentators complained live on air about technical difficulties			1
not only did they complain they they were too far from the competitors to see the actual fencing , but their monitors were not working			0
it has been reported that they were having to stream the contest live in order to provide the service			0
not the only one : @entity168 was also distraught after she lost her judo bout through disqualification of course @entity19 wo n't be the last to show an overt display of emotion when the @entity4 dream comes crashing down			1
@entity175 's judo competitor @entity168 was today disqualified from the women 's under - 63kg judo round of 32			1
@entity178 , of @entity179 , proved to be a tough opponent for @entity181 's @entity168 , but she was more than holding her own			1
during the latter stages of the bout @entity168 was adjudged to have illegally grabbed the @entity179 's leg which incurred an automatic disqualification			2
the @entity181 martial artist broke down afterwards , as she saw her @entity18 gold slip through her fingers			0
you 're out ! @entity168 looks dumbstruck when she is told she has been disqualified game over : @entity168 will have to wait another four years until she is to have another stab at winning @entity4 gold not like this : @entity168 suffered a disappointing loss against @entity178 ( right ) of @entity179			0

@entity19 bursts into tears after last - second blow by opponent @entity25
*confusion* *spreads* in @entity200 as @entity11 's coach and athlete upset by decision
