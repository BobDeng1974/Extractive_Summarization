@entity7 impersonator @entity6 , 59 , had been told wife @entity8 was leaving him , and also claimed to have been unhappy about wife @entity8 slimming down from a size 18 to a size ten after embarking on a fitness regime , and would repeatedly question her about the name of a man she befriended			1
he subsequently crept into her bedroom in the middle of the night , forced her to have sex with him at knifepoint and then , as she turned from him , her neck caught on the blade - just hours after she confirmed she was leaving him for good			2
afterwards he rang 999 and falsely claimed to have found @entity8 fatally injured on the bedroom floor and was heard to say ' easy baby , stay still , stay still ’ as she lay dying			1
happy times : but cruise ship singer @entity6 ' rape of wife @entity8 ended with her death mistaken : the couple 's 21 - year marriage had crumbled after @entity6 discovered @entity8 , 48 , was two timing him entertaining : @entity6 was a @entity7 impersonator and worked on cruises in the @entity30 , singing and playing steel drums the mother - of - three , a medical practice manageress , died a short time later in hospital from her wounds			1
the couple ’s 21 - year marriage had crumbled after @entity6 discovered @entity8 , 48 , was two timing him at home in @entity38 whilst he was 4,000 miles away , entertaining holidaymakers on board cruise liners in the @entity30			1
sentencing judge @entity41 , told @entity6 : ' when you were away working abroad , you discovered that all was not well with the relationship			1
' as can happen , she was keen on having some independence			0
she sought friendship elsewhere , including in an affair with another man			0
' but let us be clear about this			0
many men and women have to endure the discovery that their husband , wife or partner is no longer content with the relationship they have			0
' many are jealous or unhappy			0
but what the law can not and will not permit is the use of violence , which is what you used			0
convicted : @entity6 claimed the killing had been carried out by a stranger and his wife was his ' soulmate ' and ' the love of his life ' ' you went back to her house in the early hours of the morning , let yourself in , armed yourself with a knife , and went upstairs to insist that you had sex with her			1
' in my judgement she died because that blade entered her neck as she sought to turn away from your sexual advances			0
in other words she died as the result of a rape at knifepoint by you in her own bedroom			0
' you then left her to bleed to death before returning and eventually trying too late to put right what you had done by summoning help			0
had you sought help earlier , one can not know , but she might well have lived			2
' during an earlier row he had also raped her , but she was too frightened to report it to police			1
it emerged in the hours before the killing itself mrs @entity102 had been recorded on her husband ’s mobile phone saying : ' at this moment in time i do n’t feel we are going to get back together			2
' it ’s probably more what i want than what you want			2
i think it ’s better that you take your things			2
' at @entity116 , @entity6 was convicted of rape and manslaughter following a week long trial but was cleared of murder			1
he claimed the killing had been carried out by a stranger and his wife was his ' soulmate ' and ' the love of his life '			2
the jury was told the couple ’s marriage started to fail after @entity6 returned from a stint working on a @entity30 cruise ship in april last year			1
he claimed to be unhappy about his wife slimming down , and eventually became suspicious about why his wife ’s phone bill was ‘ so high ’			1
he then beat her up and swung a baseball bat until it broke on the bed			0
violence : @entity6 , right , claimed to be unhappy about his wife slimming down from a size 18 to a size ten			1
during one row @entity6 had raped her , but she was too frightened to report it to police following a later argument after a night out at a concert , mr @entity6 is said to have bitten his wife on the cheek and raped her			1
despite the violence the couple continued sharing their home in @entity38 and planned to go to the @entity30 island of @entity152 in june of last year			1
but she decided not to go because she feared for her safety at the hands of her husband			0
@entity6 went to the @entity30 alone but returned to the @entity157 two days before his wife was killed			1
when he arrived home , she refused to let him stay saying she no longer trusted him and that the marriage was over			1
the following day mrs @entity102 called a meeting with her husband in which she told him ' there was no prospect of reconciliation ' in a ' final confirmation ' of the end of the relationship			0
hours later , at 4.10am on july 23 , @entity6 let himself into the house while his wife was asleep and fatally attacked her			1
scene : police outside the house in @entity38 where 48 - year - old @entity102 met her death in his 999 call which was played to the jury he said : ' i was at a party with some friends and i just came home , well i came to my wife ’s house , she ’s on the floor and there ’s blood all over the place			1
' i think she ’s probably been cut or stabbed or something , i do n’t know			2
i ca n’t tell for sure but it seems like there must be a wound somewhere because she ’s in a lot of blood			2
i do n’t know who the attacker was			0
' mr @entity194 qc prosecuting said : ' the defendant had let himself into the house in the middle of the night , forced his wife to have intercourse with him , and then stabbed her			0
' it was perhaps an act of punishment , coming as it did a few hours after she told him it was over			0
' mrs @entity102 ’ blood was found on a kitchen knife recovered from a drawer in the property			0
outside court her family said ' no sentence in the world could ever give us back our mother			0
the sentence of 16 years passed today is of no comfort to us and we are simply left numb			0
' it does however provide some form of closure for us , her children , and the rest of the family in so far as everyone now knows the truth of what @entity6 did to our mother			1
we can now finally allow our mum to rest in peace			0
' det chief insp @entity228 of @entity229 said : ' this is a very sad and tragic case that has understandably left a family truly devastated			0
' during their relationship , @entity8 was raped and suffered a number of domestic violence incidents			1
' she found the strength to leave her abusive relationship and end her marriage , making it clear that there was no chance of reconciliation			1
' this unfortunately led to a further rape and her unnecessary death and reflects the kind of controlling and violent person @entity6 is			2
' i hope this sentencing can go some way to helping mrs @entity102 ' loved ones get their lives back on track and feeling that some kind of justice has been served			0
