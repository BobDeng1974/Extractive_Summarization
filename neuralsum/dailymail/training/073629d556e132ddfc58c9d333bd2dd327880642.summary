he has essentially served just two years for each of his victims			0
’ during his trial , @entity18 was compared to serial killer @entity19 ( pictured )			1
he attacked his victim in bars he used to run @entity8 ’s mp , @entity109 , said last night that the case was a ‘ catalogue of errors ’ , adding : ‘ it was absolutely clear when it came up at the last parole meeting that he should not be released			1
but now a simple error in the paperwork has changed all that … this should n’t be able to happen			0
’ fellow @entity121 mp @entity120 said : ‘ his victims , along with the public , will struggle to understand how justice has been served having been released following such sickening crimes			0
’ @entity8 told the @entity125 : ‘ it should be the rapists and paedophiles who have to fight for their rights , not the victims			0

@entity18 given five life sentences in 1999 for string of child rapes
he was turned down for parole last year after board found he was not safe
but a blunder by *government* *officials* meant he got a second hearing in may
this time the parole board reversed its decision and freed the paedophile
his victim blasts decision *insisting* he is still dangerous and threatened her
