by @entity0 it was the most devastating pandemic in human history			0
but 25 skeletons discovered by railway engineers beneath @entity5 suggest the @entity6 was even more lethal than previously thought			1
after analysing the teeth of the corpses , scientists believe the bubonic plague – spread by the bites of infected fleas living on black rats – mutated into a more virulent strain that passed easily from human to human			1
new theory : analysis of skeletons discovered in @entity5 believed to be victims of the @entity6 suggests the disease was not spread by rat fleas , but was in fact airborne dna of plague bacteria taken from the 25 skeletons discovered in @entity27 was compared to samples from a recent outbreak in @entity30 which killed 60 people the remains were discovered during excavations of @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity5 , an area of the capital left largely undisturbed for years this ' pneumonic ' form of plague infected the lungs of sufferers , meaning they could spread the disease simply by coughing – fatal in medieval @entity45 's crowded cities			1
it also had a much lower survival rate and could kill within 24 hours			0
the outbreak claimed the lives of around 75million people in the 14th century			1
the researchers say only the more contagious strain can explain why so many died			0
among the victims was @entity55 's daughter , @entity54 , who sailed to @entity45 to marry the heir to the @entity58 throne of @entity59			1
she died of the plague within ten days of arriving			2
the new findings , revealed in @entity62 documentary @entity63 : return of the @entity6 , which will air on sunday , emerged after engineers working on the @entity66 project discovered 25 skeletons while digging 26 miles of tunnels beneath the capital			2
they were found close to @entity71 last year , in neat rows on two levels sealed under a layer of clay			0
thousands of bodies are thought to have been interred at an emergency burial site there			0
teeth from 12 of the skeletons were sent for analysis and four tested positive for @entity82			2
the deadly bacterium is responsible for both bubonic and pneumonic plague			2
but the researchers concluded that the bubonic strain could not have had the devastating impact seen during the @entity6			0
dr @entity88 , an expert in infectious diseases at @entity90 , said : ' as an explanation for the @entity6 in its own right , [ bubonic plague is ] simply not good enough			0
the researchers were shocked to discover that the two samples were an almost perfect match , meaning the 14th century plague was no more virulent than it is today the dna samples , which were extracted from the molar teeth of the skeletons , have also revealed intriguing details of the victims ' lives @entity104 , an osteologist with the @entity105 with one of the 25 skeletons found by construction workers under central @entity5 's @entity34 last year ' it can not spread fast enough from one household to the next to cause the huge number of cases that we saw during the @entity6 epidemics			1
' he added : ' in a small number of people … the organism will spread to their lungs and they will then develop a pneumonia			1
it is that critical switch , that if there were enough people in contact with them , that allows it to spread as a pneumonic plague			1
' fellow researcher @entity104 , of the @entity128 , said the pneumonic form was ' more lethal ' , adding : ' there was no chance of recovery			0
' bring out your dead : the @entity6 decimated the population of @entity136 in the mid 14th century killing an estimated six of 10 @entity137 the new finding have come from comparing dna from teeth of the skeletons to samples from a recent plague outbreak in @entity30 the excavation work was being carried out in order to make way for the new @entity66 train line six out of 10 bodies analysed were born and bred in @entity5			1
but four had come from further afield - presumably seeking work - from the @entity151 of @entity90 , central @entity152 or the @entity153 and one from northern @entity152 or @entity155 the remains also revealed that one of the bodies could have been that of a monk - after showing signs of vegetarianism in later life , which is something a @entity165 monk would have done during the 14th century archaeologist @entity166 said : ' analysis of the @entity66 find has revealed an extraordinary amount of information allowing us to solve a 660 - year mystery ' @entity66 's lead archeologist @entity166 inspecting one of the 25 skeletons , left			0
research has shown that the burial ground was established in 1348			0

scientists have been examining skeletons of plague victims *unearthed* in @entity27 , @entity5
they compared dna taken from bones with samples from a recent outbreak in @entity30 which killed 60 people
the two samples were an almost perfect match , meaning the plague was no more virulent than it is today
they now believe that the disease was airborne and had to have been spread by coughs and *sneezes*
