by @entity0 published : 04:30 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 08:39 est , 24 december 2012 what a star ! @entity2 prepares for his royal entrance as one of the three wise men for most seven - year - olds , performing in the school nativity play is something to take for granted			1
not so for cancer patient @entity9 from @entity10 in @entity11			2
he was desperate to follow in his older brother 's footsteps and play one of the three wise men in his school 's @entity17 play			1
he had been too ill to take part last year but was now all set for his starring role			0
however , his dream was almost shattered when surgery was scheduled for the day of the performance			1
it was only the quick intervention of the child 's @entity26 paediatric nurse , @entity25 that saved the day			1
@entity2 was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma , a rare cancer which develops from muscle tissue , in 2011 , when he was five - years - old			1
his mother , @entity32 , 41 , was helping him to get ready for school in january 2011 when she noticed that his eye had closed up and that he was experiencing shooting pains in his face			2
worried that something could be seriously wrong she rushed him straight to hospital			0
he was immediately sent for tests while doctors tried to establish what was wrong with him			0
a ct scan revealed that he did not have a brain tumour , however , a few weeks later a second ct scan was carried out and his parents , @entity46 and @entity47 , were given the devastating news that he had rhabdomyosarcoma , a cancer which affects less than 60 children in the @entity51 each year			2
@entity2 underwent 18 months of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy and had to miss two years of school			1
mrs @entity32 told @entity55 : ‘ i did n’t think that anything could be tougher than being told my child had cancer			2
but , trying to explain to my little boy what was happening to him proved to be tougher still			0
‘ we told him he had nasty germs in his head , and he needed to take “ magic medicine ” to make it go away			0
‘ every day we were forced to watch our little boy in pain and , as the treatment took its toll , it almost broke us			2
’ support : @entity2 with @entity25 , the @entity72 paediatric nurse described as ' our @entity17 miracle ' by the @entity9 family @entity46 and @entity47 with their sons @entity2 ( left ) and @entity77 : they are looking forward to a cancer - free @entity17 after @entity2 's last two scans came back clear she added : ‘ he had eight weeks of radiotherapy which was horrific			1
he was so good at getting into the hospital but was terrified of the radiotherapy as he has to be screwed to the table by his head			0
a cancerous tumour of the muscles that are attached to the bones			0
they can grow in any part of the body but are most common in the head , neck , bladder and testes			0
symptoms of head and neck tumours include swelling of the eye and discharge from the nose			0
symptoms of bladder tumours include blood in the urine and difficulty passing urine			0
treatment depends on the location and size of the tumours but usually include surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			2
regular check - ups are needed once the child is in remission			0
‘ he used to play hide and seek when he was in the radiotherapy room and would kick his feet , screaming and terrified			0
he could only move his feet			0
’ not only was @entity2 suffering but his brother , @entity77 , 10 , was also feeling the effects of the @entity130 became the target of school bullies and was picked on about @entity2 ’s hair failing out			1
the family hit rock bottom as @entity2 underwent treatment and @entity77 came home from school in tears each day			1
mrs @entity32 said : ‘ then we were introduced to @entity25 , a @entity26 nurse , and bit by bit our lives started to get better			1
‘ @entity25 went to speak to the school to encourage them to think that the cancer affected both brothers			1
the teachers also spoke to their classes about the situation			0
’ now , 18 months later , @entity2 is on the road to recovery and was delighted to be offered the role of one of the kings in the nativity play			1
however , disaster almost struck for the budding actor when surgery to remove his feeding tube was scheduled for the day of the play			1
budding actor : @entity2 ( in blue ) wore the same costume his big brother @entity77 had worn in a previous year recovering : @entity46 ( left ) said watching her son @entity2 in pain almost broke her and her husband on hearing the news mrs @entity32 immediately called @entity25 , who works at the @entity170 , who was able to rearrange the surgery			1
as a result , @entity2 was able to take part in the play wearing the costume his brother had worn			1
his mother said : ‘ he was poorly last year so missed being in the play			0
he was desperate to be in it this year as his brother was in it before and it was still the same costume			2
‘ he loved it so much he has since joined a drama group and a street dance class			0
’ @entity2 has now had two clear scans and there is no evidence of the cancer in his body			2
he will continue to have scans every three months to make sure the cancer has not returned			2
mrs @entity32 said : ‘ watching @entity2 on that stage for the play was the proudest moment of our lives and without @entity25 it would n’t have been possible – she really was a @entity17 miracle			1
