by @entity1 reporter published : 23:42 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 23:42 est , 14 october 2013 the army is soon to announce its new $ 4 billion camouflage pattern and standard uniform to be worn by its soldiers as it comes under criticism for ‘ wasting ’ $ 5 billion on its last uniform which lasted less than a decade			1
the billion - dollar experiment to create a universal pattern , known as the @entity14 , or @entity14 , is being phased out as the army gets ready to reveal the new uniform			1
the army decided to scrap the two traditional camouflage uniforms that had long been used by the military - one meant for woodland environments , another for the desert – in favour of the @entity14 , which they said could be worn anywhere and blend in with any environment			1
out with the old : the army 's @entity14 grey uniform is being scrapped after less than 10 years ' blends into a parking lot ' : critics say the pattern of the @entity14 does not work in combat areas however , after less than 10 years in use , soldiers and critics say the @entity14 was a waste of money			2
in 2009 , @entity38 responded to soldiers ’ concerns about the current combat uniform which they indicated provides ineffective camouflage given the environment in @entity45			1
the result was the @entity48 uniform , which is currently being worn by @entity50 troops in @entity45			1
but the uniform was only meant to be an interim substitution for the @entity14 , which is still the army ’s official uniform and the one worn by all soldiers who are not overseas			2
temporary solution : the @entity48 uniform was introduced in 2009 after soldiers complained their @entity14 uniform did not blend into the @entity45 environment put to good use : the @entity48 is the uniform currently being used by troops in @entity45 because it blends into the environment better than the @entity14 the @entity14 provided ' ineffective camouflage given the environment in @entity45 ' , which is why the army now wears the substitute uniform , shown here former army officer @entity68 said during his 15 - month deployment to @entity70 from 2007 - 2009 , he became well acquainted with the shortfalls of the universal camouflage pattern , according to @entity73			1
in an attempt to blend in with all kinds of environments , the pattern instead wound up sticking out everywhere , its grey , gravel design that only a help to soldiers hoping to blend in with a parking lot			0
army sergeant @entity83 laughs at the mention of the universal camouflage pattern			2
‘ it is one of the things that drives me craziest about the army i have to admit , ’ he told @entity73			0
we started rolling it out in 2005 and everyone was baffled by it			0
’ while @entity83 admits there were some upsides to the design , such as easy - to - access pockets , his complaints outweighed the positives			0
‘ even currently , in my unit , we wear the normal uniform , the @entity14 when we ’re back on base , but when we go in the field we wear @entity48 , ’ he said			2
‘ we have to carry two uniforms around , one that functions properly and one that ’s merely administrative			0
’ former army officer @entity68 said during his 15 - month deployment to @entity70 from 2007 - 2009 , he became well acquainted with the shortfalls of the universal camouflage pattern soldiers day they have to carry two different uniforms at the moment - one that functions properly and one that ¿ s merely administrative for the new , as - yet - unreleased uniform , the army solicited designs from companies for patterns with three variations , one for the desert , another for woodlands and jungles and a third , traditional semi-wooded pattern similar to the one currently used by soldiers in @entity45			1
after several rounds of testing , four patterns with three variations for each , from companies in @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 were submitted to the army to choose a winner			0
the winner has yet to be announced			0
last year , the @entity139 , a federal watchdog agency , issued a report about the army spending $ 5 billion on the @entity14 uniforms and field equipment , only to spend an estimated $ 4 billion on the new design			1
the @entity145 conducted two studies on the @entity14 - once in 2006 and again in 2009 - both times finding that the @entity149 s performance came up short the @entity145 , which does research and development on things like food , clothing , shelter for the military , conducted two studies on the @entity14 - once in 2006 and again in 2009 - both times finding that the @entity14 ’s performance came up short when compared to other , more popular camouflages , like the @entity161 desert pattern or the @entity48			2
whether the current quest for the consummate camouflage will prove time and money well spent or yet another waste remains to be seen			0
according to @entity83 , the soliders are still ‘ stuck with a uniform we ca n’t wear in the field ’ .			0
