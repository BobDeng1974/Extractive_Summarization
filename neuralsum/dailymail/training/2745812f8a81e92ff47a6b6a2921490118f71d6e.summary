by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 2 february 2013 for almost 150 years , blue plaques have celebrated famous former residents , becoming in that time a much - loved feature of the @entity5 townscape			1
so the announcement by @entity7 , which runs the scheme in @entity9 , that it is suspending installation of the signs because of government funding cuts has been greeted with mournful sighs by conservation groups			1
yet for those who own a property already adorned with a plaque , it might be good news			1
blue plaques add prestige and historical interest , and those already erected are likely to be cherished to an even greater extent , and may help to increase a property ’s value			1
mark of distinction : the five - bedroom home in @entity9 's @entity29 has an asking price of £ 4.5 million , in part thanks to the blue enamelled plaque @entity33 is one of a handful of people with a blue - plaque property on the market			1
her house in @entity29 , @entity9 , which has an asking price of £ 4.5 million , was once occupied by the illustrator and engraver sir @entity42 , who died in 1945 aged 87			1
a plaque in his honour was erected in the @entity46 by @entity47 and has since been approved by @entity7			2
retired lawyer @entity33 , 59 , who is from @entity48 but moved to @entity49 in 1985 , bought the house with her late husband @entity51 in 1991 for £ 625,000			2
@entity51 , a solicitor , died ten years ago , and with her daughter @entity52 , 28 , spending most of her time elsewhere , @entity33 is now looking for a smaller property			2
inspired : the sitting room inside the property in @entity29 rising up : the plaque adds to the value of the @entity58 listed five - bedroom property built in 1820 she confesses that in 1991 the blue plaque was hardly a consideration when she decided to buy , and she had no knowledge of sir @entity42 , who was president of the @entity65			1
‘ i wanted a property with off - street parking and my husband liked the garden , ’ she says			1
since then , however , she has embraced the prestige the plaque has bestowed on her home and ‘ formed a relationship ’ with her house ’s previous occupant			2
@entity76 : the plaque on @entity33 's @entity9 home ‘ out of curiosity , i did some research on sir @entity42 and learned about his career			1
it was through this research that i managed to find some of his works at a gallery , ’ she says , pointing out three prints that hang on a wall in the ground - floor dining room			2
the prints are now part of the fabric of the house and @entity33 says she will consider offers for them from buyers of the house if they want to retain its link to @entity42			2
@entity33 was also obliged to form a relationship with @entity7 over her plans to renovate the five - storey @entity58 listed house , which was built in 1820			1
when she bought it , part of the property was in commercial use – a @entity107 company used two floors as an office			0
@entity33 wanted to restore it to a single dwelling but @entity7 laid down a number of restrictions regarding what she could do			0
she spent £ 260,000 on the renovations , benefiting from the vat exemption on work restoring older homes			0
this exemption was scrapped last october , except in cases where derelict properties are being salvaged			0
‘ @entity7 was very particular about some things			0
it was almost as if they wanted you to live like someone in the @entity127 era , ’ she says			0
‘ for example , the house had 11 fireplaces and i was allowed to remove only one , and i was n’t allowed to cut through any joists			0
’ making his mark : @entity42 , painter and engraver , who lived in the @entity9 property after which the blue plaque was erected in his honour now , with five bedrooms , three receptions , three bathrooms , a dining room and a conservatory , the house makes a fine family home			1
@entity33 also points out that the basement floor , which has its own entrance , kitchen and bathroom , could be used as a separate dwelling			0
@entity152 , of @entity153 , a company that finds homes for prospective buyers , believes the blue plaque will add value in light of the decision to suspend the scheme			1
‘ it adds terrifically to the history of a house , ’ he says , ‘ which helps it to sell and it could help attract multiple buyers , so driving up the price			0
‘ with @entity7 deciding not to consider new applications for now , this will especially apply to those selling homes with existing plaques			0
’ @entity175 , of selling agents @entity176 , says : ‘ this house is a local landmark and has generated a host of enquiries , particularly from international buyers fascinated by @entity5 history			0
