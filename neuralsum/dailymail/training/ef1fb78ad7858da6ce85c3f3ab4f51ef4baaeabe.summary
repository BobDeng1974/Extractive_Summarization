by @entity0 published : 08:44 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 09:54 est , 7 march 2014 @entity2 are facing a record - breaking fine - even if they are promoted this season - after recording a huge £ 65.4million loss , taking their overall net debt to £ 177m			1
the @entity7 club have posted their financial report for the year ending may 2013 , and the document underlines the heavy spending of co-owner @entity12 ' reign			1
but as a result of their failures on the pitch , @entity2 are now facing major ramifications under @entity18 regulations , even if they are promoted back in to the @entity19 this season			2
not a laughing matter : @entity2 , co-owned by @entity12 , recorded a loss of £ 65.4m for the last financial year only going to get worse ? @entity23 is struggling to win promotion back to the @entity19 not changing : even with the huge loss for the year 2012 - 13 , @entity2 still forked out for @entity26 under @entity29 regulations , the west @entity28 club could be forced to pay in - excess of £ 40million for breaching the rules even if they are promoted this summer			1
the club have recorded a net debt of £ 177million - a massive increase from £ 91.4m the previous year			1
turnover dropped from £ 64m to £ 60.6m , but wage costs sky - rocketed from £ 58.5m to £ 78m			2
the news casts a huge cloud over the club 's future and , in the report , @entity12 wrote : ' clearly in 2012 - 13 the club did not meet its performance targets and was relegated from the @entity19			1
' a critical driver of any club ’s value is its presence in the @entity19 , and the club is focused on regaining its @entity19 status as quickly as possible			0
' the financial results reflect the club ’s focus on trying to achieve on - pitch success			1
money : the club have only just been able to get @entity56 , now at @entity57 , off the books @entity59 : @entity60 was derided during his time at @entity62 in the top flight ' when , alongside my business partners , i purchased a majority shareholding in the club in august 2011 , my goal was to turn @entity2 into an established @entity19 club			1
' being relegated was obviously not part of our plans , but our focus and determination to achieve our long - term goals has not diminished			0
' during the summer 2013 transfer window we have worked to put together a squad of players we believe will give us a good chance of achieving promotion back to the @entity19			0
' at the time of writing , we have made a good start to the 2013 - 14 season and we remain confident that under the guidance of our manager , @entity23 , we have a squad capable of challenging for promotion			2
struggle : they 've not won any of their last four championship games and drew 1 - 1 against @entity93 last week ' we are confident that the 2013 - 14 season will also see the club continue to make progress towards achieving its short , medium and long - term off - pitch targets			0
' the group ’s key short - term objective is to regain its @entity19 status			0
the board believes that some restructuring of the playing squad is required in order to achieve this			0
however , they are conscious of the need for expenditure to be closely monitored and controlled			0
' the directors , based on cash flow projections prepared by management and through confirmation of continuing support from the groups ’ main shareholders and creditors , have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future			0

@entity2 made a loss of £ 65.4m in the last financial year
the club 's overall net debt stands at a *mammoth* £ 177m
@entity12 could be hit with a transfer *embargo* and record - breaking fine
