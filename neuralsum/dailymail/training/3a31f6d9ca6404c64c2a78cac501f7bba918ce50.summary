@entity8 wants to build and use satellite telescopes to hunt for asteroids orbiting @entity11 before using robotic spacecrafts to mine the asteroids for precious metals , water and other materials			1
the company has already received backing from @entity19 's founders - but is now asking for members of the public to donate to the project and get involved in hunting for suitable asteroids			2
@entity29 - based @entity8 is asking for public funding to build the small space telescope and use it to hunt for asteroids anyone who donates to the @entity35 campaign can use the telescope as a ' space photo booth ' to send digital photos to the telescope and have them displayed on the side			1
a remote camera will then be able to take a photo of the image , with the telescope and @entity11 in the background , and transmit the image back to the sender weight : 15kg height : 200mm height when fully deployed : 425mm @entity52 : 600mm other specifications : resolving capability : ~ 1 arcsecond wavelength range : 200 nm to 1100 nm 5 mp + image sensor active image stabilization planetary resources also hopes to launch an educational and outreach program to let students , museums , armchair astronomers and virtual travellers share use of a telescope			1
using @entity3 , a website used to raise funds for creative projects , @entity8 aims to raise £ 660,000 ( $ 1million ) by 30 june			1
if there is enough public support , @entity8 plans to launch its first telescope , called the @entity8 by 2015			1

anyone who pledges £ 16.50 ( $ 25 ) can use the telescope as a ' space photo booth '			1
anyone who pledges to @entity8 ' telescope campaign and submits a digital photo can order @entity82 cards and other merchandise with the image on people who pledge to the @entity8 campaign on @entity3 can also order @entity87 and wedding cards this involves sending a picture to the telescope , which is then displayed on the side of it like a billboard with @entity11 in the background			1

anyone who donates also gets a pledge certificate with their photo as a keepsake			0
additionally , anyone who pledges at least £ 132 ( $ 200 ) will be allowed to use the telescope to hunt for astronomical objects			2
planetary resources want to use the space telescope to explore the universe and hunt for asteroids			1
it hopes to get images like those pictured			0
@entity8 will then use a robotic spacecraft to mine any asteroids it finds for precious materials			1
anyone who pledges £ 132 ( $ 200 ) can also use the orbiting telescope for their own personal hunting missions investors already include @entity19 chief executive @entity136 and chairman @entity137 , as well as @entity138 , chairman of the real estate development firm @entity139 and the @entity140			1

@entity8 is not the first space startup to turn to crowdfunding			2
an infographic created by @entity8 shows that the @entity8 will weigh 15kg , have a wingspan of 6cm when its deployed and its named was inspired by @entity73 - a droid manufacturer in @entity74 the @entity8 telescope orbits at five miles per second and can capture images from 300 - 450 miles above the @entity11			1
it is not affected by daylight or clouds so can capture clear images @entity167 - based @entity166 , which plans commercial human expeditions to the moon , has launched two initiatives on @entity171 , another online funding platform			0
@entity166 raised £ 49,000 ( $ 75,000 ) to start a sister firm , called @entity174 , designed to funnel profits into space projects , but could n't raise the £ 158,000 ( $ 240,000 ) for spacesuits for @entity166 's first moon run			1

engineers at @entity8 have already built a prototype of the @entity8 telescope			2
it weighs @entity207 and is 42.5cm tall			0
the built - in @entity209 cameras will work at night and can capture images while it travels at around 5mph ' @entity166 founder and planetary scientist @entity211 told @entity213 : ' i think crowd - funding is a new kind of bike and people are trying and willing to ride it , some successfully , some not as successfully , but i think it 's here to stay , '			0
' these companies like @entity3 and @entity171 and @entity224 , they seem to be some kind of marketing distribution system that lets people with an idea put it out there			0
