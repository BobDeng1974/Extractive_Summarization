by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 16:04 est , 26 august 2013 encouraging your teenager to walk to school can help them do better in class - especially if they 're female			1
a study has suggested that a pupil 's cognitive performance may be improved if they walk to school rather than be driven in , and girls are more likely to benefit from this than boys			1
the new research , published in @entity15 , found performance at school among teenage girls who take a walk to the classroom is better than those who travel by bus or car			1
the study found that girls ' cognitive performance may be improved if they walk to school females who took 15 minutes or longer to walk in outperformed those who live in closer proximity			1
the @entity31 , the @entity32 , the @entity33 and the @entity34 in @entity35 embarked on the joint project and discovered the link between physical activity and performance in class			1
researchers used a sample of 1,700 boys and girls aged between 13 and 18 in five @entity46 cities through the @entity48 study			1
the authors outlined that plasticity of the brain is greatest in teenage years			2
they wrote that during adolescence , ' the plasticity of the brain is greater than at any other time of life , which makes it the opportune period to stimulate cognitive function			2
' however this is also the period of life where physiscal activity declines most , too , and this is greatest in girls			2
therefore researchers outlined that : ' inactive adolescents could be missing out on a very important stimulus to improve their learning and cognitive performance			1
' dr @entity66 , a @entity67 , suggests there are two points that urge caution about the potentially interesting result , reported the @entity72			0
teenage girls who take a walk to the classroom did better in school than those who travel by bus or car ' the study suggests not only that active travel may be related to cognitive performance in girls but also that greater effects may occur for durations of 15 minutes of more , ' he said			1
but dr @entity66 pointed out that while the improvement seemed to correlate directly with the increased activity pre-school , circumstances surrounding the lifestyles and upbringing of those girls that walked to school could also have a bearing on how well the girls performed			1
that is to say , it is not certain that the increased activity is the sole factor in the improved results			0
' the data are cross-sectional and do not allow any interpretation in terms of the direction of the effect			0
' it is quite possible that parents who actively encourage their daughters to be healthy - i.e. get sufficient physical activity - also actively encourage them with their school work			0
dr @entity66 also noted that increased walking had been seen to improve cognitive function in elderly women too			2
but dr @entity66 says that more experimental studies are required to truly assess the benefits of walking on mental health			0
' what is required is formal test of whether increased physical activity , specifically active transport to school , produces increased cognitive performance			1
the logistics of such a study are non-trivial			2
secondly , dr @entity66 questioned why there was no effect reported for boys			0
' although the authors seem to argue that girls show greater declines in physical activity during adolescence than boys , and hence are more likely to benefit , there would still be numerous boys who also could benefit , ' he said			0
nonetheless , he added , a new report by @entity138 and colleagues has shown that levels of physical activity are lower in girls than boys at the age of seven			0
those similar gender differences have also been reported in pre-schoolers in the @entity147 by @entity148 and colleagues			0
' encouraging girls to be more physically active is a major issue , ' he concluded .			0

the longer the students had to walk , the better their cognitive performance
study published by @entity15
looked at teenage girls who either walked or travelled by bus or car
females who walk for 15 minutes outperformed those who walk less
