@entity1 edge : @entity2 can lower blood pressure using mouthwash is a ‘ disaster ’ for health , increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes , scientists are warning			1
@entity11 kills off ‘ good ’ bacteria that help blood vessels relax – so increasing blood pressure			1
when healthy volunteers used @entity18 , a brand containing a powerful antiseptic , their blood pressure rose within hours			1
professor @entity21 , who led the study , last night condemned the widespread use of antiseptic mouthwash			2
she said : ‘ killing off all these bugs each day is a disaster , when small rises in blood pressure have significant impact on morbidity and mortality from heart disease and stroke			1
’ more than half of @entity36 adults regularly use mouthwash , creating a market worth £ 180 million a year			2
the study compared blood pressure levels in 19 healthy volunteers who started using @entity2 twice daily			1
their blood pressure rose by between 2 and 3.5 units ( mmgh )			1
this effect ‘ appeared within one day ’ of using the mouthwash , researchers wrote in the journal @entity45			2
for each two - point rise in blood pressure , the risk of dying from heart disease rises by seven per cent , according to separate research			2
such a rise also increases the risk of dying from stroke by ten per cent			0
heart disease and stroke are the biggest killer in @entity36			0
prof @entity21 , from @entity58 , said : ‘ we are not telling people to stop using antiseptic mouthwashes if they have a gum or tooth infection – but we would ask why anyone else would want to			0
’ dangerous rinse : the study by @entity58 in @entity67 found that blood pressure in daily @entity2 users rose by between 2 and 3.5 units @entity2 contains 0.2 per cent by volume of the antiseptic chlorhexidine			1
other antiseptic mouthwashes made by @entity74 and @entity75 contain the chemical in the same concentration			0
it kills microbes needed to help create nitrite , essential for blood vessels to dilate properly			0
but the mouthwash caused nitrite production in the mouth to fall by over 90 per cent , and blood nitrite to fall by 25 per cent			2
not all mouthwashes contain chlorhexidine : @entity89 , for example , does not			0
however , prof @entity21 said : ‘ other mouthwashes could still disrupt the healthy bacteria			0
’ dentist @entity92 said he would be ‘ very cautious about drawing conclusions ’ from such a small study			0
corsodyl makers @entity95 said their product was for short - term use to stop plaque and prevent gum disease and it also makes another product , @entity101 , which contains 0.06 per cent chlorhexidine for everyday use			0
the spokesman said their own research had ‘ not highlighted any concerns regarding the use of @entity107 per cent mouthwash as directed and increases in blood pressure ’ .			1

mouthwash brand @entity18 has been found to increase blood pressure
study found blood pressure rose between 2 and 3.5 units for daily users
