legal battle : dentist @entity1 , who tried to treat a patient in @entity3 's , outside the @entity4 today , where she is fighting the @entity7 's decision that she should be struck off a @entity9 dentist who was struck off after trying to work on a woman ’s teeth in a @entity3 ’s restaurant is fighting the decision			1
@entity14 attempted to fit a bridge in the mouth of an unnamed patient after setting up a temporary surgery in the fast - food chain 's @entity20 restaurant in 2012			1
and when the woman refused to be treated , miss @entity1 insisted that it was necessary and tried to do the work in a hallway of a nearby dental practice			1
miss @entity1 , who is registered in @entity27 , @entity28 , has been suspended since last july when the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) ruled she should be struck off			1
at the time , the @entity7 said her fitness to practice was ‘ impaired ’ by misconduct			2
miss @entity1 is now fighting a last - ditch battle to overturn that decision at the @entity4			1
miss @entity34 had previously practised in @entity35 , @entity36 , but was living in @entity9 and advertising for @entity28 patients online when she met patient 1			2
she had an informal arrangement to use the @entity42 surgery on an ‘ ad - hoc basis ’ for seeing patients			0
but her relationship with the practice manager deteriorated and she was stuck with only limited access to the premises			0
on february 18 , 2012 , she met with patient 1 in a @entity3 ’s close to the surgery			0
last july , the @entity7 professional conduct committee found , on the balance of probabilities , that she had tried to work on the woman ’s teeth in the restaurant			1
‘ @entity48 was clear and specific in her evidence on this issue , ’ it said in its decision			0
‘ she stated that you tried to put bridges in her mouth whilst in the @entity65 and , when she refused , you insisted that it was necessary , to see if they would fit			2
‘ you confirmed in evidence that your access rights to the @entity42 had already been withdrawn by the time you met with patient 1 at @entity65			0
‘ in the circumstances , the committee found that it was more likely than not that you did attempt a fitting of the bridges in that unsuitable environment , considering that you had nowhere else to go at that time			0
‘ the committee was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that you also attempted to provide dental treatment to patient 1 in the hallway outside the @entity42			2
‘ both you and patient 1 recalled that when you left @entity3 ’s , the entrance to the practice was open , as renovation work was being carried out			0
‘ @entity48 told the committee that you both entered the hallway of the practice , where you tried again to fit the bridges			0
‘ she said that you told her that you had no access to your surgery because you had lost the key			0
‘ the committee found that it was more likely than not that this did happen following your failed attempt to fit the bridges in a more public setting where the patient was understandably uncomfortable			0
’ she was also found responsible for a ‘ catalogue ’ of other failings in her work with the patient and another			0
miss @entity1 , who is registered in @entity27 , @entity28 , but lives in @entity9 , was visibly emotional as she addressed the judge at the @entity4 today			1
she claims that the @entity7 ’s decision to erase her name from the register was ‘ disproportionate ’			2
suspension or conditions on her practice would have sufficed			0
temporary practice : miss @entity1 tried to fit a bridge in patient 1 in this @entity3 's restaurant in @entity20 , @entity9			1
when the woman refused to be treated , she tried to do the work in a nearby hallway @entity117 , for the @entity7 , is contesting miss @entity1 ’s application			1
he said : ‘ given ms @entity1 ’s catalogue of failings , lack of insight and failure to engage over more than two years with an attempt to help her , then to engage in a half - hearted way , the @entity7 submits that it can not possibly be said that the decision of the professional conduct committee was wrong			1
’ the @entity7 made its decision to strike miss @entity1 off last july and she has been suspended since then pending her appeal to the @entity4			1
mrs @entity130 reserved judgment and will decide miss @entity1 ’s future at a later date .			2
