when @entity5 ’s goal flew into the net on sunday , the elderly couple sitting in the aisle seats in front of the media section rose quietly to their feet and hugged			2
whoever you support , whichever league your club are in , no matter how much or little you have spent to be there , it still feels the same when you win			1
@entity14 has changed in many ways , both in the way it is played and the way it is watched			1
few football clubs embody that more than @entity20			1
some things remain the same , though , and winning feels the same now as it did before celebrations were expressed on @entity55 and @entity56 and before clubs had a ‘ @entity59 ’ , as @entity20 did here on sunday			1
it was @entity61 2020 if you are interested			2
@entity63 chairman @entity62 suggested in print that the number of foreign players at @entity20 depressed him , as if the make - up of @entity21 ’s team somehow devalued the achievement			1
the old couple in the aisle seats yesterday are unlikely to agree			2
in all likelihood , they had season tickets at the old @entity75 , too			2
they will love their club now just as much as they did back then			2
maybe even a little more			2
they , like many , have waited more than 40 years for their turn at the top to roll round again			0
a little over a decade ago they watched @entity82 and @entity83			2
these days it is @entity27 and @entity85 wearing those shirts			0
they have always embraced players from overseas at @entity20 , though			1
@entity89 was here on sunday , as was @entity91			0
they are very much part of this club ’s heritage			2
these days they just have better players with whom to share a dressing room and those players have arrived at great cost			2
thumbs up : @entity102 ( centre ) poses with @entity85 , @entity5 and some well - earned precious metal cheer : @entity21 was all smiles as he was carried around the pitch by his players following the title win club legend : @entity89 was back at @entity20 on sunday and took to the pitch to acknowledge fans get in ! two @entity20 supporters celebrate on the pitch after the 2 - 0 win over @entity43 there will be those in the football community enjoying @entity20 ’s current tussle with @entity120 over @entity121			1
it ’s easy to label the champions as a heavy - spending club driven forwards at unnatural speed by foreign money			1
to tag @entity20 so clumsily , though , is to miss the point			1
football clubs remain , more than anything , about the people who go to watch them and those who rushed on to the playing surface at full - time are no different , on the whole , to those who follow @entity137 or @entity138 or @entity139			2
most of them will spend an inordinate amount of time watching , discussing and worrying about their team			0
their team will dominate their conversations at home , at work , in the pub and on @entity150 island beaches this summer			0
city care about their relatively small @entity153 numbers			0
they care about it in the boardroom and the dressing room			0
no club cares more about the make - up of its squad than it does about results , though			1
that is especially the case when the team plays football like this @entity20 one can			1
@entity21 ’s team have not been at their best for a while now			0
they have been functional rather than devastating			0
there is something to be said for that - just ask @entity173 - and it has been enough to get them through			0
supremely gifted : @entity20 have been functional rather than devastating on their way to winning the title on sunday , towards the end of this one - sided game , @entity43 ’s @entity185 - a candidate for a place in @entity182 ’s @entity181 squad - attempted to control a ball at the far post			1
he failed dreadfully and the ball bounced behind the goal			0
minutes later , @entity20 ’s @entity191 substitute @entity190 received a sharp pass with his back to goal			1
he controlled it instantly on the half volley , turned and - in the same movement - moved the ball onwards to a team - mate			0
it would be wrong to suggest an @entity153 player could n’t have done that			0
it would also be wrong , however , to suggest players like @entity190 , @entity85 and @entity27 have not contributed to the raising of standards in the @entity33			1
at @entity20 we can expect only that the standard will get higher over the years			1
the club will have some players to replace before long			1
@entity85 , for example , can not go on at this rampaging level for ever			0
@entity20 ’s current issue with @entity120 over @entity121 - they have been fined £ 50m for breaching the regulations - will not affect their spending plans significantly over the summers to come			1
forward thinking : @entity20 will soon have some players to replace as the likes of @entity85 ca n't go on forever they are unlikely to go backwards again - as they did last season under @entity222 - with @entity21 in charge and it will be interesting now to see if their rivals can spend astutely enough to close the gap			1
this was a rather gentle party yesterday			0
certainly it was by the standards of 2012 ’s heart - stopping finale			0
back then it felt like a dam was breaking			0
winning still feels like winning , though , and at the end yesterday a man carried his young son away from the ground			0
if @entity62 is depressed about the make - up of his team , that guy was n’t			1
looking at his son , he said : ‘ he does n’t know how lucky he is			0
he thinks this happens every year			0

@entity20 claim @entity33 title with win over @entity43
club embodies how football has changed in the way it is played and watched
@entity63 chairman @entity62 had said number of foreign players in @entity20 squad depressed him
