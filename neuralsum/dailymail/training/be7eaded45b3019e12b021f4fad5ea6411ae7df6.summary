the mayor of @entity10 , @entity8 found @entity2 on a porch near the animal 's home while campaigning on monday			1
i wanted to hit someone , ' mayor @entity15 told @entity17			2
he ended up helping @entity2 's owner pay for veterinarian bills to remove the arrow mr @entity15 called police and @entity2 was taken to @entity37 where veterinarian @entity38 performed surgery to remove the arrow lodged in the cat 's upper torso			1
she says @entity2 survived because the tissue hardened around the entry and exit points which prevented him from bleeding to death			0
it also did n't puncture any vital organs			2
' it completely missed the jugular , the lungs , the heart , and both bones on each side , ' dr @entity38 told @entity56			0
' miracle kitty : lucky for @entity2 , no major organs were hit and veterinarian @entity38 ( right ) was able to completely remove the arrow			1
@entity2 is recovering fine and should be able to go home by the end of this week ' it 's a miracle that arrow missed everything inside of him			1
that cat was meant to survive , as far as i 'm concerned , ' mayor @entity15 said			1
dr @entity38 estimates that @entity2 was shot two days before being found and was sitting at the time of the attack			2
the arrow 's position within @entity2 's body meant that the cat could n't curl up at night to keep warm			2
luckily , dr @entity38 was able to completely remove the arrow and @entity2 is recovering though he may have sustained some permanent nerve damage			2
back in action : @entity2 may have sustained some long - term nerve damage , but he is able to walk again despite being the target of a cruel human act , the cat is still friendly towards people			0
' he did n't once try to bite or act vicious			0
and i would n't have blamed him			0
he 's been in a lot of pain , ' hospital co-owner @entity84 told @entity87			0
ms @entity84 said that @entity2 should be able to go home to his owner , @entity89 , by the end of this week			1
still friendly : hospital workers are surprised the cat is still playful around humans after being targeted in such a cruel attack ms @entity89 , who is elderly , was n't able to afford @entity2 's medical bills so mayor @entity15 stepped in to pay for them			1
authorities believe that the cat was used as target practice judging by the type of arrow used			0
' somebody did this intentionally , ' animal control officer @entity103 told the @entity106			0
' it 's not like a gun ; an arrow does not go off by itself			0
' @entity110 is currently investigating and hoping to catch the person or people responsible			0
