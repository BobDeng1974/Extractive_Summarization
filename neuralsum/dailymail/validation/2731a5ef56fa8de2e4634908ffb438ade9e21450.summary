the actor also insisted the @entity55 ‘ do n’t believe in the @entity64 ’ and added : ‘ for me , there ’s only one choice – and i choose @entity9			0
’ at first glance , it appeared to represent a much needed boost for mr @entity2 as @entity3 is a good deal more famous than some of @entity9 ’s other celebrity backers – such as baldrick actor @entity71			1
but last night it emerged that mr @entity3 spent years supporting a far - left @entity73 that was set up by the militant miners ’ union boss @entity26 in protest at @entity9			1
in an interview with the @entity77 ahead of the 2005 election , @entity3 declared that he voted for the party in 2001 and would not back @entity80			2

a spokesman for the actor was asked to comment , but did not respond			0
it was a major coup for @entity9 leader @entity2 ( pictured ) but he faces embarrassment after it emerged @entity3 is a former @entity26 supporter the star also hit the headlines two years ago after it emerged his long - term partner @entity49 had declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid £ 120,000 tax bill , despite living with @entity3 , who is worth more than £ 10million			1
miss @entity49 , who also appears in @entity52 , had been with @entity3 for 11 years at the time			0
the couple have two children			0
the revelations sparked an outpouring of bad publicity for the couple , prompting miss @entity49 to settle her debts			0
she told the @entity123 later in 2013 : ‘ it ’s fine , it ’s being sorted out			0
it was a big mistake and i ’m sorting it out right now			0
‘ it ’s being paid off now			0
i would never want to go through this again			0
but i ’m paying it off			0

instead , he focuses on contrasting @entity9 ’s ‘ values ’ with those of the @entity55 , who he claims ‘ have got sod all to offer the young ’			0
@entity55 mp @entity96 said : ‘ @entity9 is trying to whitewash @entity2 from their campaign – his mps do n’t want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast does n’t even mention him			1
