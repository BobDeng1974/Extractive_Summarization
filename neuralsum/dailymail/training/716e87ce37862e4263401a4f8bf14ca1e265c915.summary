by @entity0 published : 04:19 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 07:08 est , 1 april 2013 @entity1 , 20 , was accused of being anorexic when she dropped from a size 12 to a size four a 20 - year - old has been diagnosed with a rare stomach disorder after dropping from a size 12 to a size four in the space of a year			1
@entity1 lived on just a handful of boiled sweets and three squares of chocolate a day leading doctors to assume that she had an eating disorder			1
however , @entity1 , who weighed nine stone before falling ill , insisted she was not suffering from an eating disorder and begged doctors to believe she was not anorexic			1
in fact , she claimed she was desperate to eat more but felt constantly full and bloated despite her meagre diet			2
only her parents believed she was telling the truth and , after insisting on more tests , @entity1 was finally diagnosed with gastroparesis , a condition that meant the nerve that emptied her stomach was paralysed			1
@entity1 was immediately admitted to hospital and tube fed before finally having a pacemaker fitted to her stomach to allow her to start eating again			1
@entity1 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , said : ‘ it was awful having nobody believe i was ill. because i was a teenage girl losing weight quickly people just assumed i was anorexic			1
‘ the doctors were convinced i had an eating disorder and even tried to persuade my mum i needed help			1
‘ even strangers in the street would make horrible comments about me being anorexic and tell me to eat			0
‘ thank goodness mum and dad believed me when i told them i did n’t have an eating disorder			1
@entity48 pushed for more tests but it was still another six months before i was diagnosed			2
‘ it ’s frustrating that any young woman losing weight is labelled anorexic			0
’ @entity1 , a barista in a coffee shop , had a healthy appetite until she turned 18 and started struggling to finish her meals			2
‘ it felt like it was getting stuck in my throat and after eating i ’d get stabbing pains in my stomach and feel sick , ’ she explained			2
‘ i wanted to eat but could n’t so i would just pick at my meals			0
but even that left me uncomfortable			0
‘ i saw my gp a few times but they just told me to eat more and sent me away with bottles of @entity77			0
’ eventually it became too painful to finish her meals and @entity1 was surviving on boiled sweets and chocolate			1
@entity1 's condition means that the nerve which is meant to empty her stomach is paralysed @entity1 was treated at the @entity85 in @entity86 where she was fed through a tube to help her put on weight ‘ i was serving people delicious cakes and sandwiches all day at work and wanted nothing more than to eat myself but i knew it would leave me in agony			1
‘ only every time i want back to the doctor they said there was nothing wrong with me , ’ she said			0
seeing their daughter waste away , @entity1 ’s worried parents @entity102 , 46 , @entity103 , 43 , insisted on taking her back to their gp again			1
this time , mrs @entity1 was taken aside and the doctor told her @entity1 was most likely suffering from an eating disorder			1
before being admitted to hospital @entity1 was surviving on a few boiled sweets and a small amount of chocolate each day she was released from hospital after three weeks but still had to be tube fed for 14 hours a day at home @entity1 said : ‘ i could hear the words being whispered to my mum and was shocked and angry because i had already told them i did n’t have an eating disorder			1
‘ but people see a teenage girl losing weight and that is all they think			0
it ’s a lazy assumption to make			0
’ thankfully @entity1 ’s mother and father believed their daughter and pushed for a referral			2
even after being discharged from hospital @entity1 was unable to eat normally without suffering from pain and sickness @entity1 said : ‘ i was gutted when the first round of tests and scans came back clear and i feared that was it , everyone would be sure i was anorexic now			1
‘ my weight was dropping faster than ever and i looked horrific			0
’ but @entity1 ’s parents persisted and more tests at the @entity85 in @entity86 in april 2012 finally revealed that she had the stomach condition gastroparesis			1
it meant her stomach was not emptying efficiently explaining why she felt constantly bloated and full			2
@entity1 said : ‘ having an answer was such a relief			2
at last people had to believe i did not have an eating disorder			1
they finally knew i had been telling the truth all along			0
’ in september 2012 , with her weight below six stone , @entity1 was admitted back to the @entity85 and put on feeding tube for almost three weeks			1
even when she was well enough to be discharged , @entity1 had to be tube fed via her nose at home for 14 hours a day			1
‘ it was horrible , the machine was inside a backpack but it made a really loud humming noise all the time , ’ she said			0
she gained weight but was still unable to eat normally without suffering pain and sickness			0
‘ i begged me specialist for an answer and he mentioned a gastric pacemaker			0
i ’d heard of pacemakers before but not for the stomach , ’ she added			0
medics explained it would help pump the food from her stomach into her intestines			0
@entity1 ( pictured , right , with her mother @entity65 ) had a pacemaker fitted to her stomach and can now eat normally again slowly , after the operation at the end of october 2012 , her appetite returned			1
‘ after a year of not eating it hurt so i took lots of painkillers and built up slowly to a few forks of pasta at a time , ’ she said			2
now , six months after the operation , she can eat a small plate of food and continues to gain weight			0
she now weighs 7st 10 and is a size six to eight			0
‘ i want to warn that not all young women losing weight are anorexic , please do n’t be too quick to label us when there really could be a serious health problem that has nothing to do with eating disorders			2
‘ believe me , i would like nothing more than to be a curvy size 12 again , ’ she said			1
gastroparesis is a chronic condition which means the stomach can not empty itself of food normally			2
symptoms include feeling sick or full when eating , bloating and weight loss			0
it is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles that control the emptying of the stomach			0
the cause of the problem is usually unknown but it is most common among people with poorly managed diabetes			0
it is also associated with some medications , parkinson 's disease and multiple sclerosis .			0

she lived on boiled sweets insisting she was not *hungry* and was bloated
doctors warned her parents that she probably had an eating disorder
she insisted this was not the case and *underwent* a barrage of tests
was diagnosed with gastroparesis and admitted to hospital to be tube fed
has now returned to health size eight after having stomach pacemaker fitted
