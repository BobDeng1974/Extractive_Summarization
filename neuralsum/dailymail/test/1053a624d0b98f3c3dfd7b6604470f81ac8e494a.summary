@entity0 scored a first - half winner for @entity2 as they got over their nightmare start to the season against @entity6 to move off the foot of the @entity8 in @entity9			1
@entity10 and @entity11 were both left out of their sides through injury but despite the absence of their @entity17 designated player - who was sat in the stands alongside @entity19 , the @entity2 were able to find just their second win of a difficult campaign so far			1
@entity0 found the net with just his second goal of the season and it proved enough despite the @entity6 having plenty of chances to equalise at the @entity28 centre			2
@entity29 gets to the ball ahead of @entity2 striker @entity0 , who scored the opening goal @entity2 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity33 ; @entity34 ( @entity35 86 mins ) , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 83 ) , @entity43 , @entity44 ; @entity0			1
unused subs : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50			0
booked : @entity34 , @entity41 , @entity43 , @entity0			2
@entity6 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity29 , @entity56 ; @entity57 ( @entity58 85 ) , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 89 ) ; @entity63 ( @entity64 , 74 ) , @entity65			0
unused subs : @entity67 , @entity36 , @entity68 , @entity69			0
booked : @entity65 , @entity29			0
both sides started strongly , but it was the @entity6 ' @entity75 had the first chance of the game after nine minutes , flicking on from a cross that was tipped over the crossbar by @entity80			1
@entity75 again saw a header blocked by the keeper after 21 minutes and though it was the visitors with the best of the early chances , one minute later the @entity2 were ahead			1
@entity43 sent a cross dep into the penalty area and centre back @entity36 rose to direct it back across @entity53 's goal			0
the @entity92 goalkeeper scrambled to re-adjust but was beaten to it by @entity0 who could hardly miss and duly put the @entity2 into the lead			1
@entity75 had a third chance on the stroke of half - time but could n't find the net having exploded through the @entity2 defence only to place his shot too close to @entity33 who saved easily , diving to his right			1
the home side went in at the break ahead , and they came close to doubling their lead almost immediately after the break when @entity38 shot low , forcing @entity53 into a sharp save at his near post			0
@entity43 fired wide from distance moments later			0
@entity55 of @entity6 wins a high ball against @entity2 goalscorer @entity0 in the first half but back came the @entity6 , and they should have levelled when @entity113 latched on to a low cross but fired straight at @entity33 from point - blank range when anywhere else would have led to a goal			2
the remainder of the game saw few clear - cut chances			2
@entity65 had an effort easily saved from distance and while the home side looked dangerous on the break they often failed with the final ball			0
and so @entity0 's strike proved enough as @entity2 claimed just their second win of the 2015 @entity9 season .			1
