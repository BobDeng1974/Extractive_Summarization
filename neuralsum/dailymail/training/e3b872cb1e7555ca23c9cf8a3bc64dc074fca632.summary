by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 11:40 est , 12 september 2013 a man has caused outrage after finding the world 's oldest message in a bottle - and refusing to open it			1
worn and battered , but still sealed , the elusive note has finally reached a reader - 1,115 miles and one century later			1
the green glass artefact was spotted sitting on the shore of the secluded @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			0
the envelope , visible through the bottle , shows @entity16 's address and where the letter was sent from strolling along the recently excavated beach on monday morning , @entity18 noticed the bottle lying in the middle of an open stretch of sand			1
the note inside is signed by @entity16 , who was 76 hours into a boat trip from @entity26 to @entity27 , @entity28 , when he ' posted ' his note			2
it was a route that would take him around 10 days to two weeks if the ship stuck to its schedule			0
hailing from a day when the delivery of cross-country letters was something of a @entity38 roulette , the @entity16 will never have known if his note arrived			0
but mr @entity18 has infuriated people worldwide by refusing to open the letter			0
determined to preserve what has stayed intact since september 29 1906 , he has decided to leave the details of the message shrouded in mystery			2
all that can be read through the bottle - the cap of which is rusted over - is the date it was thrown into the sea , september 29 1906 and that it is signed by @entity16			1
it lists @entity16 's address and states that he was a passenger on a steamer from @entity26 to @entity28 and that he threw the bottle into the sea 76 hours into the voyage			1
the 107 - year - old bottle was nestled in the sand of @entity61 in @entity11 , @entity12 outcry : @entity18 has infuriated people by refusing to open the artefact as a way to preserve it mystery , however , surrounds what the envelope inside contains - but mr @entity18 is refusing to open the bottle			1
he said : ' maybe there was only one bottle that the guy sent out and i found it			0
it is like a one in a billion chance			0
' online comments about the bottle include many from people who have seen local news reports in @entity12 , with a poster called @entity83 writing : ' @entity84 was the message ? ' @entity86 wrote : ' how can he not open it ? ' ' i hope they open it because it was meant to be read one day , ' wrote @entity92			2
at 107 years old - almost to the day - the bottle looks set to be named the oldest ever found			1
the previous @entity94 for a message in a bottle was 98 years after @entity98 fisherman @entity97 found a bottle in @entity100 last year			1
the bottle in @entity98 contained a postcard offering a reward of sixpence to the finder			2
mr @entity18 added : ' i guess it is a chance that you find something that somebody sent out into the water			0
' a hundred years later is just unreal			0
