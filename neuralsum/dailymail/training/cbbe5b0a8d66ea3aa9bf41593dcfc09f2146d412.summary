by @entity0 published : 20:36 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 20:38 est , 31 january 2014 up to 50 troops are living at a £ 100 - a - night hotel at taxpayers ’ expense because there are not enough beds at their barracks			1
around 20 @entity9 and 30 @entity11 personnel have been booked into the three - star @entity12 in @entity14 , four miles from the @entity16 naval base			1
the hotel , near the city centre , has a restaurant , sauna , steam room , gym and satellite television			1
members of the group are each receiving £ 25 food vouchers a day and have boasted of dining ‘ on fillet steak every night ’			1
lucky manoeuvre : around 50 troops , including marines like those pictured , are being housed in the @entity14 @entity12 the revelation provoked anger as the @entity34 has pushed through crippling military cuts , including axing 30,000 troops , fighter jets and warships , in a bid to save around £ 43billion			1
it also emerged as prime minister @entity41 defended the belt - tightening during an appearance before a parliamentary committee			0
the @entity34 yesterday insisted that it was ' extremely rare ' to put up troops in hotels			0
the story came to light after three @entity9 enjoying a sauna at the @entity12 told another guest of the situation			2
according to the men they had been placed at the hotel ' indefinitely '			2
the man said : ' they seemed to be enjoying themselves			0
they told me some of them were going to @entity61 's every night			0
better than the barracks : the servicemen are staying at the @entity64 , just four miles from their base lap of luxury : the marines , who are given a £ 25 food voucher every day , boasted of eating fillet steak every night ' but in a time of defence cutbacks sticking 50 troops in a hotel seems like madness			1
' it must be costing so much money to put them up there			0
the hotel is three star and they said they 're getting a £ 25 food vouchers a day			1
' it seems crazy they 're in a hotel just four miles away from the barracks just because the military ca n't get their act together			2
' defence sources insisted the @entity34 had negotiated a special discount rate for the rooms of about £ 50 a night			2
the situation is expected to last ' a few days ' , they said			0
insiders said there were not enough beds at barracks because there had been an influx of troops passing through @entity16			0
an @entity34 spokesman said : ' due to a slight increase in the requirement for accommodation in @entity14 we can confirm that a limited number of @entity11 personnel are staying at a local hotel			1
' we can be clear that this is only a temporary arrangement to ensure their duties can be carried out and a special rate was secured to ensure the best value for money for the taxpayer			0
