the missing @entity1 space probe that bumped down onto the surface of a comet 284 million miles from @entity3 could wake up from today			1
scientists at the @entity5 have restarted efforts to listen for a signal from the stricken lander on comet @entity9			1
they lost contact with the washing - machine sized spacecraft in november last year after it bounced several times before landing in a hollow below a cliff			1
starved of the sunlight it needed to power its suite of experiments , the lander 's batteries went flat after around just 60 hours on the surface			2
@entity5 scientists have renewed efforts to contact the @entity1 lander on @entity25 , shown in the illustration above however , as the comet has travelled closer to the sun in its journey through the solar system , researchers hope @entity1 will get enough light to come back to life			1
the @entity35 probe , which was carrying @entity1 , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of @entity3 and @entity38 to slingshot its way towards comet @entity40			1
it chased comet @entity42 – @entity43 through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the @entity1 lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 1 metre ( 40 inches ) per second relative to the comet			1
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet			0
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface			0
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude			0
scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on @entity3 - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet			0
the @entity5 has now turned on the communication unit on the @entity35 spacecraft that is orbiting the comet			1
@entity79 , lander project manager at the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , said : ' @entity1 currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in november last year			1
' it will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up , but it is worth trying			0
the prospects will improve with each passing day			0
' @entity25 is now 186 million miles ( 300 million km ) from the sun. scientists hope that as the comet rotates and gets closer to the sun , @entity1 's solar panels will move out of the shade of the cliff it is resting under			1
@entity1 touched down on @entity9 on 12 november , but rather than landing softly , the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice			2
it first bounced to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) and then 65ft ( 20 metres ) before finally coming to rest at an angle on uneven ground			0
blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air			0
scientists described the comet 's surface as being more like a trampoline , causing the probe to rebound so far			2
it is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site			0
the @entity35 orbiter took a number of images of @entity1 as it bounced , with its final suspected resting place in the top right			1
however , further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe the duck - shaped comet @entity121 is moving closer to the sun and warming up as it does this image sent back by the @entity1 lander shows one of its three feet next to what appears to be a cliff face @entity131 have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the mothership @entity35 in an attempt to find the missing probe			1
@entity1 was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an overhanging cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander			1
before its batteries finally ran out , @entity1 managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images			0
among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet 's surface appears to be made of a very hard ' sintered ' ice			0
this graphic shows how @entity1 bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life			2
from several miles above the comet , @entity35 has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived			0
but there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander 's solar panels			1
this would mean it may struggle to get enough light to power its communication units and the experiments it is carrying on board			0
the image above is a composite of four pictures taken by the @entity35 probe while flying 12 miles above the surface of the 2.4 mile wide comet 67p and shows the dramatic landscape that surrounds the @entity186 lander @entity25 is due to reach its closest point to the sun in august this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander			1
@entity1 requires its internal temperature to reach at least -45 degrees c before it can wake up			0
it will also require at least 5.5 watts from its solar panels to wake up			2
once awake , @entity1 will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the @entity35 orbiter			1
@entity198 , part of the @entity1 lander team at the @entity201 , said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home			1
he said : ' @entity1 is designed so that , since november 2014 , it has been using all the available solar energy to heat up			2
' ' at this time , we do not yet know that the lander is @entity208 send us an answer , @entity1 must also turn its transmitter – and that requires additional power			1
' this blurry image captures the moment @entity1 bounced from the comet 's surface after failing to anchor itself @entity35 captured a mothership 's view of @entity1 as it descended to the surface of @entity219 on 12 november 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface @entity1 needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two - way communication			1
over the next eight days the @entity35 orbiter is due to transmit signals to its lander and listen for the response during a series of 11 flybys			2
engineers have also sent new commands to the lander to optimise the heating and provide energy savings to improve its chances of communication with @entity3			0
once @entity1 wakes up and can also transmit , it will first send data about its ' health ' to @entity3			0
the scientific work with the 10 instruments on board @entity1 also depends on these results			0
if sufficient energy can not be stored in the battery , the solar energy available during the comet daytime will determine whether a reduced version of the measurements can be performed			0
currently , scientists believe that @entity1 is in sunlight for 1.3 hours - just a fraction of the 12.4 hour long day that the comet enjoys			2
mr @entity79 added : ' once we can communicate with @entity1 again , the scientific work can begin			2

@entity5 has begun attempting to contact the lost probe
@entity1 has been missing since november when it landed on @entity25
scientists believe the lander bounced into a ditch in the shade of a cliff
but they say it may already be awake but not yet able to send *messages*
the probe needs 19 @entity270 of power from its solar panels to communicate
as the comet gets closer to the sun the lander may receive more sunlight
scientists have sent commands to @entity1 for it to begin warming itself up
they will attempt to contact the lander with @entity35 over the next 8 days
