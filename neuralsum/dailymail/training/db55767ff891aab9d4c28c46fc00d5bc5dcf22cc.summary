' and the 83 - year - old former astronaut expects it to become a reality by 2040			1

it 's been 44 years since the @entity27 landings and @entity2 thinks there has been ' too little progress ' since a group of scientists are trying to replicate what it would be like to live on @entity5 , by living and working in spacesuits in the @entity36 desert			1
engineers , geologists and biologists from the @entity40 are living in cramped conditions with limited water , electricity , food and oxygen , a vast distance from home			0
the ' astronauts ' are a group of volunteers who are helping to discover ways to investigate the feasibility of a human exploration of @entity5 and use the @entity36 desert 's @entity5 - like terrain to simulate working conditions on the red planet			2
@entity2 said : ' i have always felt @entity5 should be the next destination following our landings on the moon			2
' i believe this nation should commit itself , within two decades , to commencing @entity4 permanence on the planet @entity5			2
' @entity2 added that the advances made by @entity68 's @entity67 and the pictures it has beamed back from the red planet have added to public interest			1

@entity2 believes this is the most economical transportation system concept between the two planets			1
he believes that using this capability , humans could arrive and settle on @entity5 between 2035 - 2040			1

former astronaut has devised a transport system to get to and from @entity99
@entity2 thinks ' too little progress ' has *happened* since the @entity27 landing
