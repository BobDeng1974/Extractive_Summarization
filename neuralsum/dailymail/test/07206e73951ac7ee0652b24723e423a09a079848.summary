@entity0 believes @entity1 and @entity2 have not been able to show the same level of consistency since they returned from @entity7 duty and hopes to see a big improvement when @entity9 face @entity10			1
@entity1 has been one of the stars of the @entity12 , scoring 29 goals in all competitions for @entity9 , and is just one away from becoming their first player since @entity17 in 1992 to hit 30 goals in a season			1
the @entity7 forward has been nominated for both @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity7 call - up hurt the form of @entity1 , according to his @entity9 boss @entity0 @entity0 believes that midfielder @entity2 has also been affected by the call - up @entity2 has been one of the best young midfielders in @entity7 this season and has burst on to the international scene in his first full season in the top flight			1
but since being called into @entity34 ’s squad for the first time for the games against @entity37 and @entity38 , the duo have been well below their best as @entity9 slumped to a goalless draw against @entity42 and a shock 1 - 0 home defeat against @entity45 last weekend			2
@entity0 said : ‘ when players get their first call - up , they try to show they are good enough and try to impress the national manager , and because they are over-motivated they expend a lot of energy			1
‘ when you come back to the team , the consequence is that for two or three weeks you are a little bit down			2
it is normal and this happened at @entity58 too			0
‘ i remember that we were third in the table and we went to play against @entity62 in november			0
if we won , with three points we ’d have been first in the table			0
the performance was n’t good			0
why ? because we ’d spent a lot of energy and it was difficult to keep our focus on the normal life			0
@entity0 hopes the pair can improve their standard of recent performances against @entity10 @entity1 scored on his @entity7 debut after coming on as a substitute against @entity37 at @entity77 last month ‘ i remember my first call - up for @entity79 against @entity80			1
i was up on a cloud for a month after it because it was unbelievable to play for the national team			2
when i got back to @entity85 it was difficult			0
i ’d been away for 15 days with my national team and i came back and i said , “ oh , but now i play with @entity88 , @entity89 ... ” you feel like a superstar and then you have to go back to @entity85			2
’ meanwhile , @entity0 has told supporters to judge him on where @entity9 finish next season			1
he added : ‘ this season was one of transition			0
we brought a lot of young players , we got to a cup final at @entity77			0
next season we need to build a team to fight for the top four			1

@entity0 says @entity1 has struggled since @entity7 debut
also believes his team - mate @entity2 is suffering as well
21 - year - old @entity1 has scored 29 goals in all competitions this season
