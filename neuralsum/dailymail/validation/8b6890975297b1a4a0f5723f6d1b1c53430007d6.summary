after a raucous @entity2 victory over the @entity3 , @entity0 must now decide which surface will give them the best chance of upsetting the @entity7 in the quarter - finals			1
as the home side , @entity9 can choose the venue for the july 17 clash against last year 's runner - up			0
it is tempting to stick with the indoor hard court in @entity16 where the local fans created a tremendous atmosphere last weekend , but , in this case , the grass is greener			1
@entity21 has a good record on hard courts against @entity7 's fearsome quartet of @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , winning 18 and losing five			2
but on grass , he has been totally dominant , unbeaten against all four in six matches			0
@entity21 celebrates during his straight sets win over @entity32 that clinched the @entity34 a quarter - final place the @entity0 team celebrate their 3 - 2 victory over the @entity3 in @entity16 last weekend doubles team @entity38 ( left ) and @entity40 have both experienced success on grass courts against @entity25 and @entity28 in particular , @entity21 can draw on the memories of some famous victories on the lawns			1
in 2011 the 27 - year - old beat tsonga in the final of the @entity48 at @entity49			0
he also defeated the world no 13 in the @entity52 semi-finals on the way to lifting the trophy in 2012			0
and it was a 2008 last - 16 win against @entity25 on centre court that made the nation realise that this wild - haired @entity58 had something very special			0
a 21 - year - old @entity21 stormed back from two sets down to win 5 - 7 , 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 4			1
there is more good news for the doubles players			0
@entity64 has reached 17 doubles finals but none have been on grass			2
@entity68 has won a tournament on the grass of @entity71 in 2013 , but all of his other seven titles have come on an indoor hard court like @entity16			1
@entity21 beat @entity7 @entity28 on grass in the 2012 @entity52 semi-finals the @entity7 team of @entity78 , @entity64 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity68 celebrate after their win against @entity80 in @entity81 @entity0 's pair of @entity38 and @entity83 , meanwhile , have thrived on grass			1
the @entity58 has one title and two finals appearances on the green stuff , and the @entity88 won at @entity89 last year			0
so @entity9 should forgo the cauldron of the @entity91 in @entity16 for the more sedate lawns of @entity93 or @entity89 , assuming the @entity52 grass will not have had time to recover .			2

@entity0 will host @entity7 in the quarter - finals of the @entity2
@entity99 beat the @entity3 3 - 2 at the @entity91 in @entity16
they now get to choose whether to play on grass or on a hard court
@entity21 has never lost to a member of the @entity7 team on grass
doubles team @entity38 and @entity40 both have a title on grass
