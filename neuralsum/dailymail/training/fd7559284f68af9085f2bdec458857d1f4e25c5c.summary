it is one of football 's most iconic images - @entity1 taking on the @entity4 as he tried to conquer the world			1
such was the danger @entity1 posed to the @entity4 goal during this group 3 match in @entity10 during the 1982 @entity11 , it seems they 've put six men on him			1
but all is not what it seems			0
the photograph is wonderful - @entity1 in his pomp , unafraid to take on all - comers - but it is rather misleading			1
iconic : the famous photograph of @entity1 appearing to take on half the @entity4 team at the 1982 @entity11 june 13 , 1982 - @entity11 , @entity23 , @entity10 ( @entity24 : 95,000 ) @entity25 : @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 ( c ) , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity1 , @entity34 ( @entity35 63 ) , @entity36 @entity37 : @entity38 , @entity39 ( c ) , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 scorer : @entity47 62 the @entity4 rearguard action is not @entity1 's markers , it is actually a defensive wall to an @entity55 free - kick that has splintered			1
we are less than a minute into the second half at the @entity59 , the score is still goalless and @entity1 has won his team a free - kick , with @entity62 earning himself a yellow card for the foul			1
it 's too far out to attempt a shot but @entity67 has the chance to put the ball into a dangerous area			0
@entity1 lurks 10 yards away from the wall and the video of the moment shows them frantically gesturing for someone to pick up the dangerman			2
@entity67 takes a short free - kick to @entity1 and it 's at this point the wall breaks up and starts to hunt down the ball			1
on the attack : @entity1 carries the ball forward into the @entity4 half as @entity25 search for the breakthrough in their opening match of the 1982 @entity11 tripped : @entity1 is brought to ground by the @entity4 defender @entity62 , prompting referee @entity86 to award a free - kick in the book : the referee also booked @entity89 for the foul , barely a minute into the second half mark him ! players in the @entity4 wall frantically urge one of their colleagues to mark @entity1 , who is stood about 10 yards away from the wall as @entity67 prepares to take the free - kick @entity99 ball : @entity67 strokes the ball to @entity1 , who has still not been picked up the moment : as @entity1 takes in the ball with his left foot , the wall splinters and looks towards him			1
it is at this point the famous photograph is taken the famous photograph is taken just as @entity1 cushions the ball with his left foot , the eyes of the six players in the wall all trained towards him			1
it is taken in the split second before @entity31 runs through the cluster of @entity4 players because no other @entity55 players are in shot			2
@entity1 tries to return the ball to @entity31 but the danger is snuffed out by the alert @entity89			2
nowhere to go : @entity1 tries to pick a pass to @entity31 , who has run through the cluster of @entity4 players snuffed out : but @entity1 is unable to find a teammate and the swarming @entity4 defence manage to clear the ball cleared : the danger passes as @entity37 get the ball away			1
they go on to win the match 1 - 0 tight squeeze : @entity127 surrounded by six @entity129 players at the @entity130 in an echo of the famous @entity1 photo so this spectacular photograph is a trick			1
the perfect angle and the perfect timing to show one of the greatest ever players at his swaggering best			0
@entity37 went on to win the match 1 - 0 , @entity140 scoring the winner on 62 minutes			1
both advanced from the group			0
