published : 05:16 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 06:32 est , 19 august 2013 after a year and a half behind barbed wire as a prisoner in @entity4 , 2nd lt. @entity0 had just about reached his breaking point			2
deliveries of @entity8 parcels to @entity9 had all but ceased , and the @entity11 bomber co-pilot and his fellow pows were subsisting on scant rations of bug - infested soup and bread			1
outside the wire , @entity17 's forces showed no signs of giving up			2
cold and hungry , the @entity21 - born soldier made a difficult decision			1
he slipped the gold aviator 's ring - a gift from his parents engraved with his name - off his finger and passed it through a fence to an @entity31 pow , who handed back a couple of chocolate bars			1
desperation : 2nd lt @entity0 , seen centre with fellow soldiers , traded his precious ring for two chocolate bars while being held at a pow camp the pilot would never see his treasured ring again - but almost 70 years later it has found its way back to his family			1
the gold ring had ended up in the hands of a @entity47 soldier on his way home from the war , who is thought to have traded it for a night 's room and board at a small pub in present day @entity55 - owned by the grandparents of @entity57 , 64			1
mr @entity59 ' grandmother gave him the ring when he moved to @entity62 in 1971 , for luck , or in case he needed some quick cash			1
he said he knew the ring must have come from an @entity68 soldier , but had no idea how to trace the owner			1
the master church painter and artist wore the ring on his little finger , before eventually placing it in a corked glass bottle for fear it would get damaged as he worked			2
that is until @entity68 couple @entity79 and @entity80 moved into the house next door in the tiny @entity84 village of @entity85			2
after inviting the @entity86 for dinner , mr @entity57 enlisted the help of the computer - savvy pair to try and trace the origins of the gold ring			1
' better to give than to receive ' : @entity57 is seen holding a photograph of his @entity95 grandparents , who gave him the ring in 1971 when he moved to @entity62 @entity97 went online when he got back home , and within 20 minutes he found a 2005 master 's thesis from @entity101			1
one focus of @entity104 's 219 - page paper was the war diary of his wife 's grandfather , @entity108 - the name on the ring 's inscription			1
and there , on page 179 , was the anecdote about the chocolate bars			2
after all those years , this epic ring cycle had ended within a two - hour drive of where it began			2
' it just seemed like it could n't be true , ' mr @entity120 e-mailed @entity104 a photograph of the ring and its inscription , who contacted the bomber pilot 's 67 - year - old son , also called @entity128			1
' that 's it for sure , ' an ecstatic mr @entity0 replied when @entity104 forwarded the picture			2
' well , praise the @entity131 ! ' @entity80 wrote back			0
' we are so excited for your family ! ' after a few more e-mails and phone calls , the ring was on its way to the @entity68			1
last week , about a dozen family members and friends gathered in the living room of @entity144 's @entity143 home and watched as he slit open a small yellow parcel from @entity62			1
' and here it is , ' he said with a long sigh as he pulled out the ring			0
' oh , my goodness			0
... i never thought it would ever happen			0
i thought it was gone			0
we all thought it was gone			0
' he thought it was gone , ' he said of his late father			0
team effort : @entity57 and @entity161 are seen with their neighbours , @entity68 couple @entity79 and @entity80 , who helped mr @entity57 to trace the ring 's original owner following the december 1941 @entity169 attack on @entity170 , the elder @entity0 left college and enlisted			1
the @entity172 accepted him on his second @entity173 graduated from flight school on july 26 , 1942			0
that same day , he married his high school sweetheart , @entity175			0
to celebrate his commission , @entity177 and @entity178 presented their middle son with a gold signet ring , the oval emblazoned with a raised propeller and wings			2
engraved inside were the words , ' @entity185 to @entity186 , @entity21 , ' and the numbers 10 - 4 - 18 - 42 — his birthday and the current @entity189 was assigned to the @entity190 , @entity191 — part of the ' @entity194 ' @entity193			0
by october , he was in @entity195			0
back where it belongs : with the help of @entity97 , left , and @entity57 , right , the gold ring has been returned to the son of its original owner as a co-pilot in the @entity204 ' , @entity0 flew more than a dozen bombing missions over occupied @entity206 and the @entity62 heartland			1
he was awarded the @entity208 for helping to get his burning plane back to @entity195 from a may 1943 raid that cost the lives of half his 10 - man @entity214 july 28 , 1943 , @entity0 's plane was shot down over @entity215 , @entity62			1
he parachuted into a rose garden , was taken prisoner , interrogated and then shipped to @entity218 , the pow camp made famous in the @entity221 film @entity222 remained there until january 1945 , when he and the other @entity224 officers were force - marched three days through the snow , then packed into train cars for another three days before ending up at @entity9 near @entity228 , northeast of @entity230 's @entity229 collapsed upon itself , pows from all over found their way to @entity228			1
by the time @entity0 arrived , conditions there went from bad to what one historian described as ' barely correct by the standards of the @entity239 '			0
it was at @entity228 that he traded the ring for the candy @entity244 , on april 28 , 1945 , gen. @entity241 's @entity240 liberated the camp , and @entity0 , who was promoted to 1st lieutenant , made his way back to @entity21			1
he started a tire retreading equipment company with his brother , and he and @entity175 raised three @entity250 did n't talk much about the war , except to remind his children of his privations when they refused to clean their plates			0
and he spoke wistfully about his lost ring.upon his return from the war , one of the first things @entity0 did was to have an exact duplicate made of his prized ring — right down to the inscription			2
when he died in 1994 , the replica passed to his son , @entity263 , who wore it until it finally broke in the middle			0
cradling the original in his hand after opening the package friday , the pilot 's son was struck by the ring 's condition , compared to its replacement			1
his sister , @entity276 , walked over and took the ring in her hands			0
' gosh , it 's beautiful , ' she said as tears welled in her eyes			0
' oh , that 's so special			0
' @entity128 said holding the ring gave him goose bumps			1
' i feel his presence , ' he said of his father			0
' i wish he was here			0
' @entity161 — whose own grandfather spent several years in a @entity291 camp during and after the war — said in a phone interview with the @entity294 that his only regret is that @entity128 and his grandmother were n't alive to share the ' happy ending '			2
refusing to accept even reimbursement for the shipping , he added , ' you know the old saying : it 's better to give than to receive			0
