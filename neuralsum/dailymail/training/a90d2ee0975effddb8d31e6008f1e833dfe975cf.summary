by @entity0 published : 12:53 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 20 april 2013 what happens when you wring out a wet cloth in space ? this was the question posed by two high school students of @entity9 astronaut @entity8			1
fortunately , as he currently lives on board the @entity12 orbiting @entity13 , he was able to demonstrate the remarkable answer			0
commander @entity8 's live experiment on board the space station was beamed back to 1,200 pupils at @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43			1
the @entity44 had asked pupils to come up with a simple science experiment that he could perform in space			2
teenagers @entity49 and @entity51 came up with the ' ring it out ' experiment to test how a microgravity environment might affect and experiment using items which would already be available on board the station			0
speaking into a floating microphone , commander @entity8 first soaked a wash cloth in water			1
then , as it floats in front of the camera , he attempts to squeeze out at the liquid			0
incredible results : the water takes on a jelly - like form a clings to the astronaut 's hand mind - boggling : commander @entity8 has performed hundreds of simple scientific experiments in space and posted the results online demonstration : earlier commander @entity8 had sprayed ordinary drinking water onto the cloth but without the force of gravity , it simply surrounds the cloth or attaches itself to commander @entity8 's hands like a gel			1
pupils can be heard gasping with excitement as they witness the mind - boggling reality of life in space from their school 's gymnasium			0
science teacher , @entity92 , said : ' @entity93 was a great tool to teach about space , science and weightlessness in my class			2
in addition , having this opportunity to speak live to commander @entity8 from space was a special treat the students will remember for a long time and may influence their future career paths			1
' commander @entity8 said : ' the space station is an orbiting laboratory where we work on unique experiments that may eventually improve life on @entity13			1
' addressing the schoolchildren back in @entity9 , he said : ' i was about your age when i decided i wanted to become an astronaut			2
i hope that you remember today and continue to be curious about science and space			0
you are the space explorers of the future and the sky is no longer the limit ' .			0

commander @entity8 performs science experiment in space
without gravity , water simply forms floating ' tube ' around the cloth
students *watching* live in @entity43 , @entity9 , gasp in amazement
