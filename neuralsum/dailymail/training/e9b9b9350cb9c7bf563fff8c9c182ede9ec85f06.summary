a mystery small ' hot spot ' in the @entity2 is responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the @entity5			1
the hot spot , near the @entity8 intersection of @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , covers only about 2,500 square miles ( 6,500 square kilometers ) , or half the size of @entity14			1
yet a new @entity16 map show is produces more than triple the standard ground - based estimate			0
the @entity8 area ( red ) is the major @entity5 hot spot for methane emissions in this map showing how much emissions varied from average background concentrations from 2003 - 2009 ( dark colors are lower than average ; lighter colors are higher )			1
the hot spot , near the @entity8 intersection of @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , covers only about 2,500 square miles			1
methane is very efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere			2
like carbon dioxide , it contributes to global warming			0
to calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air , the authors performed high - resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model , which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds			1
in each of the seven years studied from 2003 - 2009 , the area released about 0.59 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere			2
this is almost 3.5 times the estimate for the same area in the @entity48 's widely used @entity49			0
in the study published online today in the journal @entity53 , researchers used observations made by the @entity56 's @entity55 for @entity59 ( @entity58 ) instrument , which measured greenhouse gases from 2002 to 2012			2
the atmospheric hot spot persisted throughout the study period			1
a ground station in the @entity64 , operated by the @entity66 's @entity65 , provided independent validation of the measurement			0
to calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air , the authors performed high - resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model , which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds			2
is this the cause ? the @entity8 coal - fired power plant , near @entity80 , is one of the targets @entity16 wants to investigate as a possible cause of the methane research scientist @entity85 of @entity16 's @entity86 ( @entity86 ) in @entity87 , @entity88 , first noticed the @entity8 signal years ago in @entity58 data			1
' we did n't focus on it because we were n't sure if it was a true signal or an instrument error , ' @entity85 said			0
the study 's lead author , @entity95 of the @entity97 , @entity98 , noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing , known as fracking , near the hot spot			1
this indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in @entity11 's @entity109 , which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country			1
natural gas is 95 - 98 percent methane			2
methane is colorless and odorless , making leaks hard to detect without scientific instruments			0
' the results are indicative that emissions from established fossil fuel harvesting techniques are greater than inventoried , ' @entity95 said			0
' there 's been so much attention on high - volume hydraulic fracturing , but we need to consider the industry as a whole			0
' in just one place in the @entity5 do four states meet			2
the borders of @entity12 , @entity10 , @entity11 , and @entity9 intersect at @entity8 , west of the confluence of the @entity130 and @entity131			1
coalbed methane is gas that lines pores and cracks within coal			2
in underground coal mines , it is a deadly hazard that causes fatal explosions almost every year as it seeps out of the rock			0
after the @entity5 energy crisis of the 1970s , techniques were invented to extract the methane from the coal and use it for fuel			1
by 2012 , coalbed methane supplied about 8 percent of all natural gas in the @entity5			1
@entity85 noted that the study demonstrates the unique role space - based measurements can play in monitoring greenhouse gases			0
' satellite data can not be as accurate as ground - based estimates , but from space , there are no hiding places , ' @entity85 said			0
in march 2014 the @entity156 announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions under its @entity159			0
the strategy includes improving the measurement and monitoring of methane emissions and assessing current methane emissions data .			0

small ' hot spot ' responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the @entity5
area near the @entity8 intersection of @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 covers 2,500 square miles
researchers *initially* thought reading was a *bug* in *software* because it was so big
*hotspot* predates widespread fracking in the area
