the fact that @entity1 knows he can not underestimate @entity2 , that at no price can he or his @entity4 champion footballers take the men in red as vanquished , is historically established			1
you do remember @entity9 , do n’t you ? but it was n’t actually in the @entity12 city ‘ @entity1 ’ learned this lesson			1
the unwelcome humiliation at the hands of @entity2 did not begin on may 25 , 2005 when a three - goal lead for @entity1 ’s @entity17 was pitifully insufficient			1
@entity18 @entity1 knows that he can not underestimate @entity2 in the @entity19 this week @entity20 and co are looking to impress themselves on the @entity4 champions at @entity24 on wednesday @entity25 kisses the @entity19 trophy after @entity18 beat rivals @entity27 in may @entity1 actually learned about never walking alone , ( ‘ non camminerai mai solo ’ in his native tongue or ‘ nunca caminarás solo ’ as the @entity33 say , with reverence ) in the @entity29 capital			1
it was more than two decades earlier when the current @entity18 manager watched , in agony while @entity2 and the cup with the big ears taught him a major lesson			1
one which should serve him well this week when the @entity19 holders visit @entity24			1
it was the 1984 @entity44			0
@entity45 was the host venue and it was an infernal pity , for @entity48 , that @entity2 became the visitors			1
@entity1 would have been there , in midfield , to greet and then repel them , had it not been for a game against @entity54 the previous december			1
in what was a 1983 star - studded version of the hostility which is once again dividing @entity29 football this season , @entity48 travelled to @entity54			0
@entity1 had , until then , played every single minute of @entity48 ’s @entity44 matches , driving them into the quarter - finals			2
@entity54 could boast @entity61 , future @entity63 manager @entity62 and 1982 @entity65 winner and top scorer @entity64 , but there were also @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71			0
the match ’s names trip off the tongue			0
@entity48 were champions , @entity54 wanted the crown back			0
then , bang on the half hour , bang went @entity1 ’s chance of his first ever @entity44 ( although so far there have been seven more as player and manager )			2
in a collision with his international team - mate , @entity54 ’s @entity84 , @entity1 ’s left knee collapsed and he was sidelined for months			2
and thus he could only watch @entity2 refuse to wilt the following may			2
refuse to buckle while @entity48 ’s own @entity85 howled and ranted that this was ‘ their ’ night , their home ... ‘ their very own ’ @entity44			0
it is ironic that , as @entity1 watched on helplessly , @entity92 ’s wobbly legs and penalty high - jinks distracted @entity94 from scoring and induced him to sky his kick over the top			2
ironic because , 11 years later in @entity9 , @entity1 was again helpless , the manager on the touchline as @entity17 wilted and @entity101 morphed into the modern version of ‘ crazy @entity92 ’ , such that @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 flopped on penalties they would normally score blindfolded and wearing hiking boots			1
‘ they are a team with special connotations for me — some bad memories , some good , ’ he said			0
‘ twice they beat me when the @entity44 was there to be won , that time with @entity48 when i could n’t play and then in 2005			0
but i won the @entity19 final against them in 2007 and my @entity114 side beat them 2 - 1 at @entity24			1
‘ now my goal , @entity18 ’s goal , is to do what nobody else has done			2
to win back - to - back champions @entity119			0
‘ as a player with @entity17 , i did it when the competition was the @entity44 — we won two in a row			0
but now this motivates us to set a new mark in the @entity19			0
‘ last year there was so much talk about the obsession with ‘ @entity131 ’ ( @entity18 ’ s 10th competition win ) — that was our driving force and we achieved it			1
@entity48 's @entity94 , psyched out by @entity92 , blasts his spot kick high over the bar in 1984 @entity137 celebrates as @entity18 clinched the @entity19 against @entity27 in @entity138 ‘ to win ‘ @entity143 ’ is now on everyone ’s lips and while it ’s a long road , i ’ m convinced we are in the mix for the trophy because of the talent in our squad			1
’ that talent was on show as @entity137 hit a double as @entity18 put five past hosts @entity151 on saturday			0
in the end , @entity2 is a game about the future for @entity18			1
the future of ‘ @entity156 ’ ( @entity143 )			0
but with flavours of the past for @entity159 .			0

@entity2 host @entity18 at @entity24 in the @entity19 this week
@entity1 was @entity17 boss that night in @entity9 back in 2005
@entity1 is *attempting* to win *consecutive* @entity4 trophies
