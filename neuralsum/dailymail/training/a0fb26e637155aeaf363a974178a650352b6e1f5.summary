by @entity0 most people are content with spotting birds and butterflies in their garden			0
but a @entity6 amateur photographer has set his sights a lot higher and has taken incredible images of the sun ’s raging surface from his back yard			1
the 72 - year - old managed to capture violent solar flares and spots on the sun ’s surface , which is 5,505 ° c and approximately 93million miles ( 150million km ) away from @entity18			1
this incredible image of a violent solar flare was taken by a @entity6 amateur photographer from his back garden in @entity23 , @entity24 @entity25 , from a village near @entity23 in @entity24 has spent the last 40 years scouring the skies using an array of powerful telescopes , which have set him back over £ 2,000			1
his latest images are spectacular and show solar flares as the sun goes through its ‘ solar maximum ’ – a period when it is most active , which comes around every 11 years			1
‘ the sun is a star 10 times as close to us as the planet @entity39 - a thought i always find sobering , ’ mr @entity25 said			1
the 72 - year - old managed to capture violent solar flares ( pictured ) and spots on the @entity46 s surface , which is 5,505 ° c and approximately 93million miles ( 150million km ) away from @entity18 @entity25 ( pictured ) , from a village near @entity23 in @entity24 has spent the last 40 years scouring the skies using an array of powerful telescopes ‘ right now solar activity is at its maximum , but not its most spectacular			1
' ‘ my favourite image is the solar flare with an associated outburst , just inside the solar limb [ ‘ edge ’ of the sun ]			2
its position gives a nice 3d effect			0
' he added : ‘ i also like the wide horizon shot showing general surface activity			0
’ the small black areas are sunspots , which are a little cooler than the surrounding surface of the star the amateur astronomer and photographer has spent 40 years scouring the skies and used specialist equipment to capture the swirling surface of our star , including solar flares ( the white flash ) and dark sun spots ( also pictured ) mr @entity25 captures the images by replacing the eyepiece on his telescope with a miniature charged - coupled device camera , a gadget often used for deep - sky , planetary , lunar and solar photography			1
he can take thousands of frames before using computer software to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle			0
mr @entity25 said : ‘ sometimes the image is as much art as science and the image is often coloured to best serve the original wow factor from the live view			2

this is one of his favourite images mr @entity25 has been a keen astronomer for the last 40 years and built his first telescope when he was 29			2
he has been fascinated ever since			0
here the sun 's swirling gaseous surface is pictured solar flares are created when magnetic energy builds up and is suddenly released			1
they extend out to the layer of the sun called the corona – the outermost atmosphere of the sun. the small black areas are sunspots , which are a little cooler than the surrounding surface of the star			0

his current telescope set - up is pictured the father - of - one usually uses a five inch refracting telescope equipped with a hydrogen - alpha solar filter to take his images of the solar flares ( pictured ) a flare ( pictured ) occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released			1
this image is the photographer 's favourite as he thinks the solar flare , just inside the solar limb [ ' edge ' of the sun ] gives the image ' a nice 3d effect ' the father - of - one usually uses a five inch refracting telescope equipped with a hydrogen - alpha solar filter to take his images			1
despite being millions of miles away from the sun , he always urges caution when trying to capture it			0
‘ you have to be careful			0
never look at the sun through anything other than equipment specialised for direct solar viewing or it will blind you , ’ he warned			0
solar flares ( pictured ) extend out to the layer of the sun called the corona , which is the outermost atmosphere of the star and is made up of highly rarefied gas a flare is defined as a sudden , rapid and intense variation in brightness and occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released			2
radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from long wavelength radio waves to x-rays and gamma rays			0
the amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100 - megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time , according to @entity186			0
the first solar flare was recorded in 1859 by two scientists - @entity189 and @entity190 , who were independently looking at sunspots at the same time and saw a large flare			0
solar flares extend out to the layer of the sun called the corona , which is the outermost atmosphere of the star and is made up of highly rarefied gas			2
this gas normally has a temperature of a few million degrees @entity200 , but inside a flare , the temperature typically reaches can reach as high as 100 million degrees @entity200			0
the frequency of flares coincides with the sun 's eleven year cycle and at its maximum – approximately every 11 years – solar flares are more common and larger .			1

the images show solar flares as the sun goes through its ‘ solar maximum ’ – a period when it is most active that occurs approximately every 11 years
