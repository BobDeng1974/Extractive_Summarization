@entity1 ’s leadership came under fire again last night after details of a row with outspoken @entity6 frontbencher @entity5 were revealed			1
mr @entity5 , as @entity6 welfare spokesman , protested at a decision to crack down on the benefits rights of @entity11 immigrants			1
when mr @entity1 refused to back down , the fiercely pro-european mr @entity5 threatened to walk out of the @entity12 unless the party leader gave him another plum job			1
so mr @entity1 gave in and moved mr @entity5 to what friends claim is his ‘ perfect job ’ as arts spokesman			1
mr @entity5 , as @entity6 welfare spokesman , protested at a decision to crack down on the benefits rights of @entity11 immigrants the secret deal avoided creating a damaging @entity6 rift but has led to fresh claims by the party ’s @entity26 that mr @entity1 is ‘ not tough enough ’ to be prime minister and ‘ too weak ’ for @entity29			1
one veteran @entity5 said : ‘ if @entity1 can not summon the courage to sack someone like @entity5 , he will never command the respect of his team			0
’ the disclosure comes a month after mr @entity1 was mocked for the way he sacked left - wing mp @entity37 , who was fired last year for repeatedly refusing to toe the line on party policy			0
ms @entity37 said that the @entity6 leader asked her if he was doing the ‘ right thing ’			0
the secret deal avoided creating a damaging @entity6 rift but has led to fresh claims that mr @entity1 is ‘ not tough enough ’ to be prime minister sources said the @entity6 leader was so desperate to avoid a resignation over immigration policy that he ‘ tamely ’ agreed to move mr @entity5 to a new frontbench job			1
the row broke out after @entity49 , shadow work and pensions secretary , unveiled plans last month to force jobless migrants from the @entity11 to wait for two years before they could claim out - of - work benefits			0
the move by ms @entity49 , then mr @entity5 ’s boss , was designed to counter criticisms that @entity6 was ‘ soft ’ on immigration			1

within a fortnight , he was moved from the welfare brief to the party ’s culture , media and sport team			0
friends said : ‘ @entity5 did n’t agree with the policy announced by @entity49 and he made it very clear			0
he was ready to quit and said so , but instead , he was offered the arts post which , frankly , is a perfect job for @entity5			0
’ they denied reports mr @entity5 had also found it difficult to work under ms @entity49 , who was only elected to the @entity72 in 2010			0
mr @entity5 ’s move was a little - noticed part of a wider reshuffle sparked by shadow attorney general @entity77 ’s resignation after she was accused of ‘ snobbery ’			2
ms @entity77 quit after tweeting a picture of a terraced house with three @entity82 flags and a white van outside it during a visit to @entity86 where mr @entity5 was in charge of a @entity6 by - election campaign			2
last night , neither the @entity6 nor mr @entity5 were available for comment .			2
