this frightening photo shows how a young man 's leg swelled to nearly four times its normal size in a life - threatening medical episode he believes was triggered by a game of limbo			1
@entity7 , 19 , from the @entity8 of @entity9 , is learning to walk again after an alarming medical scare where blood in his leg became clotted in late october			1
doctors twice told his family he was going to die during the episode caused by the @entity17 blood disorder , a condition that rarely causes clots in fit young people			1
at one point during the months - long ordeal , doctors were removing 9l of fluid from his leg each day			1
@entity7 believes he first began experiencing symptoms after playing the popular party game in mid-october			1
his leg swelled because of clotting caused by his @entity17 disorder @entity7 was a very fit , healthy young man ( left ) , telling @entity40 he did 80 push ups every night			1
but the disorder left him hospitalised for weeks ( right ) and doctors twice told his family he was going to die cleaved open : doctors had to slice open @entity7 's leg to clear the clots and reduce his leg swelling ' they called my parents and told them to come in straight away ' , @entity7 told @entity40 as he continues on his path to recovery ' i had a sore back at the start , a couple of weeks before it all happened			1
i thought i did that doing limbo , of all things , ' he told @entity40			2
' i went to the doctors and got a ct scan and all that and he said , " you 've probably just pulled muscles			2
" and then i started to get a swollen leg			2
' within a couple of weeks his leg had become more sore - made even worse when he fell off his bike			2
he was hospitalised on october 28 after finding himself completely immobilised by his engorged leg			2
blood clotted from below his kidneys to his heel and blood had pooled behind his stomach			0
he was immediately admitted to @entity74 for emergency surgery , with doctors slicing him open			0
' they called my parents and told them to come in straight away , ' @entity7 told @entity40 , recounting the hours after he was taken into hospital in late october			1
' that night they took me down and it was only going to be a three hour operation			0
( @entity83 ) said goodbye to mum , said " mum i love you "			0
' that was about 10pm at night			0
i did n't come out until 5 in the morning			0
' they went to my mum and dad saying , " we 've done all we can			0
we do n't think he 's going to make the day			0
" ' i was n't awake or anything but i can imagine how bad it would have been			0
' hospitalised : @entity7 , pictured , has spent two months in hospital on account of his reaction @entity7 , pictured here with his nephew , was fit and healthy prior to the incident after six days in an induced coma , @entity7 woke			1
but within ten days all of his clots returned , plus an additional one in his pulmonary artery , because of an allergic reaction to blood medication			0
he was whisked to @entity106 in @entity108 's inner east on november 8 where - for a second time - doctors told the family he was likely going to die during an operation to remove the clots			1
' i was awake this time , so i was a bit shocked			0
i was like , " this is a little crazy " , ' @entity7 said			2
doctors managed to save both his life and his leg , although he is now unable to lift his toes or his ankle			2
@entity123 dr @entity122 , from the @entity121 , told @entity40 a clotting episode could have been triggered by a trauma such as limbo			1
' it is entirely possible he constricted a vessel or damaged a vessel doing an activity , and because of his @entity17 the clotting process just went on uncontrolled , ' dr @entity122 said			1
dr @entity122 said clotting episodes could be a ' life changing ' event			0
after 15 operations , @entity7 has stabilised and is currently in @entity137 , learning to walk again and taking blood thinning medication			1
' i 'm hobbling around			0
i can walk - not well - but i can limp , ' he told @entity40			1
