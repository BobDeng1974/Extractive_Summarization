prime minister @entity0 has been hosted at the @entity1 for a working dinner with president @entity3 , where the two leaders were expected to discuss economic growth , trade and security			1
mr @entity0 arrived at the @entity1 late last night after having spent his first day in @entity9 meeting with @entity10 , director of the @entity11			1
mr @entity3 greeted him in the @entity12 before the two walked together into the presidential residence to begin their discussions			2
mr @entity3 is toughening up the @entity32 response in the wake of the embarrassing and damaging @entity39 hack on @entity40 and the infiltration of @entity43 and @entity44 sites			0
ahead of tonight 's working dinner , mr @entity0 warned of the increasing threat of cyber attacks			1
' this is an evolving threat which poses a real risk to our businesses and that 's why we 're taking our cooperation with the @entity32 to an unprecedented level			0
this is about pooling our effort so we stay one step ahead of those who seek to attack us			0
the leaders ' discussions were undertaken last night during a ' working dinner '			2
judging by the menu , it looks to have been one of mr @entity0 's more enjoyable duties			1
' the joint exercises and training of our next generation of cyber experts will help to ensure that we have the capability we need to protect critical sectors like our energy , transport and financial infrastructure from emerging threats			0
' under the plans @entity77 and @entity78 will join forces with @entity81 and @entity82 to turn an @entity32 cyber cell into a transatlantic operation , to improve information sharing about threats			0
the prime minister 's two - day trip to @entity9 appears to have started well - earlier in the day miss @entity10 lavished him with praise for @entity31 's role in leading the world in economic growth			1
however , their leaders ' meeting comes amid heightened fears about terrorism in @entity98 and the @entity99 after last week 's terrorist attacks in @entity101 , in which 17 people were slain			0
cyber-terrorism and surveillance will be central issues at the visit , which @entity108 strategists hope will be a pre-election ‘ love - in ’ between mr @entity0 and mr @entity3 and boost the prime minister ’s standing at home			1
unusually , the president has agreed to host mr @entity0 close to an election , apparently repaying the favour mr @entity0 made by visiting the @entity32 and all but endorsing him during the last presidential race .			2
