by @entity0 for the @entity1 the plunge in profits at @entity4 looks like a disaster , but that does n’t tell the whole story			1
the previous year ’s financial results were flattered by a £ 155million tax credit in the @entity10 , without which the club would have registered an £ 8.8m loss			1

but @entity4 ’s troubles are n’t over just yet			2
next year , revenue is expected to fall sharply due to the failure to qualify for the @entity29			1
a back - of - the - envelope calculation suggests that the campaign under @entity32 is likely to cost the club nearly £ 50m in lost income			0
spending on staff , which includes the cost of signings and salaries , soared by 19 per cent last year			0
given the phalanx of high - earning arrivals over the summer , that figure looks likely to rise again			0
the club will need to be careful it does not live beyond its means for too long , or it could eventually be forced to become a selling club to balance the books			0
since @entity47 has arrived at @entity4 the club has spent more than £ 150m on transfers @entity4 have spent more than £ 500m servicing debt since the @entity50 took over the club			2
