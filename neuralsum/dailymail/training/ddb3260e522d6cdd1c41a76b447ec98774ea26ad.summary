the supercar firm donated the special edition @entity8 to a charity auction to raise money for victims of the @entity13 earthquake in may			1
@entity5 executive @entity14 eventually won the auction with a winning bid of £ 1.1 million ( $ 1.4 million )			1
the @entity1 was the star attraction among the many items put up for the auction by the @entity31 company			2
under the bonnet is a @entity34 engine which develops a staggering 740bhp to make it one the ultimate track cars			1
it is such a hardcore , no - holds barred machine that it is not allowed to be used on road or in specific race series			0
the new yellow @entity1 caught the eye of @entity44 even though he wo n't be allowed to drive it on the road instead , ultra-rich owners tend to leave them to be looked after by @entity1 and brought out three - times a year for special manufacturer days			1
@entity26 described the auction as a ' pole position result ' , praising the ' big heartedness ' of the @entity1 fans who took part in the bidding			2
he added : ' i would like to thank all the clients , collectors and enthusiasts that did their bit			0
' their bids have sent out a message of warmth and solidarity to the people in our region affected by this tragedy			0
' the region of @entity72 has been rocked by two devastating back to back earthquakes leaving major infrastructure damage and 16 dead			0
@entity1 boss @entity26 said the outcome of the bidding was a ' pole position result ' flying high : the proud new owners of the @entity1 mingling with the company 's most high profile figures video : watch a similar model of the @entity8 burn some rubber !			0

ultra-rich owner will probably leave car with @entity1 and ask them to bring it along to track days three times a year
@entity34 engine delivers 740bhp making it one of the ultimate track cars
money from winning bid will go to victims of @entity13 earthquake in may
