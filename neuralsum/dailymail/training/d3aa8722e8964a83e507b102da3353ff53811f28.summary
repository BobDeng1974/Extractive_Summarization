by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 3 march 2013 updated : 10:39 est , 3 march 2013 retail guru @entity1 has been branded as a ' @entity2 ' by critics who say her plans to help struggling high streets are nothing more than ' gimmicks ' that have failed			1
traders in the seaside resort of @entity10 in @entity11 , which won a £ 100,000 government grant , claim the town 's high street is now in a worse state than when she arrived to help , as the government - appointed ' retail tzar ' , six months ago			1
her plans for the town have included displaying art in abandoned shop fronts			0
but supporters say @entity1 has done much to help promote the coastal town , as a bitter war of words casts a cloud over the @entity29 's efforts			0
the row erupted as new figures reveal little of the £ 1.1million set aside by the government to reinvigorate high streets across @entity33 has actually been spent - with @entity10 using just over £ 100 of its £ 100,000 pot. the high street campaigner came under recent fire after it was revealed @entity38 spent more than £ 1,000 of its grant money hiring a person in a @entity42 costume , as well as nearly £ 6,000 on newspaper surveys			1
it was hoped £ 100,000 would help reclaim the heyday of the mid- 1800s , when throngs of @entity59 visitors would flock to the seaside town			0
today @entity10 's high street is a much different picture and with a 35.1 % vacancy rate , there are few shops left to attract potential customers			1
so when the government enlisted @entity1 to help boost struggling high streets , retailers were no doubt thinking their shop tills would be ringing again in no time			2
but figures published today in @entity74 , under a @entity76 request by retail expert @entity77 , show just £ 111.47 of the £ 100,000 had been spent on @entity10 's retailers by december 2012 , using a combination of stationery and land registry searches			1
the four people who led the original @entity84 grant application have all resigned and claim @entity86 ' plans had ' no substance ' and she focused her energies on helping the old town and seafront , which have not been as badly effected in the economic downturn			2
@entity93 , who led the bid last year , said : ' it has all been a huge waste of time			0
it is all gimmicks and no substance , there is nothing real that has been done , not for local people who want to shop in their local shops			0
' high street spending : the percentage of grants used by 12 winning towns between may and december 2012 on the beach : @entity86 has come under fire for focusing on @entity10 's @entity111 , but the retail expert claims she was merely showing what the high street could become another trader , @entity115 , who owns @entity117 's restaurant , also claims neither the money or the arrival of @entity86 have done much to change the situation			1
but the council and the new @entity84 say much is being done to help the high street , including plans for community dance studios and steak houses			0
@entity126 , who took as chairman of the new @entity84 in october , said not spending the money means they still have it for spending on planned projects			0
he added : ' she [ @entity86 ] has n't done it 100 % right , i agree , but she has tried to promote @entity10 and has brought a lot of publicity			2
' high hopes : prime minister @entity136 appointed @entity1 as his high street tsar in may 2011 @entity10 is not the only town clutching onto its grant			1
the figures reveal that overall just £ 161,773 , or 14.5 % of the £ 1.11m has been spent			1
while @entity10 has only spent 0.1 % of the money , both @entity143 ( 4.6 % ) and @entity144 ( 4.9 % ) have also spent under 5 %			0
@entity145 spent the most , with 37.7 % of the grant allocated to helping its high street			2
@entity1 dismissed the claims as ' ridiculous ' , adding that she filmed @entity10 's old town as part of her programme series to show what the high street could become			1
she added : ' there are people who comment , there are people who point and there are people who roll their sleeves up			0
in rolling my sleeves up , i come [ in ] for a knocking and i just have to take it but i can sleep at night			0

@entity166 ' retail tzar ' @entity1 comes under fire as traders claim she has failed to reinvigorate @entity33 's high streets
new figures reveal 14.5 % of £ 1.1m of @entity166 grants has been spent on helping boost local shops
@entity10 has spent just over £ 100 of its £ 100,000 grant
critics say the town 's high street is worse since queen of shops arrived
@entity86 hits back at ' ridiculous ' claims
