' i used to love my job , and the girls that turned on me were close friends , ' explains @entity2			1
' i could n’t put my finger on anything i ’d done wrong			1
' for months i could n’t leave the house alone and when i did i broke down in tears in fear of seeing the women that had done this to me			2
' i would tell my mum that i was going to walk out onto the road in front of a car because that pain would be more bearable than what i was going through			2
' that was the moment i decided i wanted to continue with pageants - i wanted to show that anybody can face their fears , everybody is beautiful and most importantly , mental health issues do not have to ruin your life			1
' @entity2 's ordeal began after she left school and went to work for her local council on an apprenticeship			1
she thrived in the working environment and made some good friends through work			2
' i was given responsibility and was really enjoying it , in fact i was having the time of my life			2
' but things went downhill fast			2
people began to change - arguments were being started in the office and i started getting hurtful texts in the middle of the night			2
' i felt small , weak and constantly questioned what i had done to deserve this kind of treatment			2
one particularly bad day i just cried in front of the toilet mirror			2
i could n’t even bear to get the bus home for fear of looking stupid			0
winner : @entity11 , 21 , took home the @entity85 in the @entity26 @entity25 and @entity27 confidence : it took @entity2 a long time to regain her confidence after being bullied for months ' my friend came to pick me up and brought me a block of chocolate to cheer me - you know it ’s bad when even chocolate does n’t make the situation any better			1

i cried the entire car journey home			0
i felt so stupid , humiliated , petty and weak			0
' for weeks i could n’t tell any what was wrong , but when i eventually told a few friends they were really understanding and supportive			0
' but it was my mum who was my rock			0
it must have been awful for her to hear how her daughter planned on killing herself , and i ’ll never forgive myself for that			0
' proud : nichole with her parents shortly after triumphing at the @entity26 @entity25 and @entity27 beauty pageant better : @entity2 now wants to become a role model and to help raise awareness of mental health issues after leaving the council and her bullying colleagues , @entity2 got a new part time job but it was n't until october last year that everything changed for the better			1

' my sister and friends persuaded me to hand over my email address so they could send over the details , ' said @entity2			1

i made it through to the final and went on to win the @entity24 crown , as well as doing a lot of charity work			0
it boosted my almost non-existent confidence no end			0
' since then @entity2 has represented @entity21 in the @entity152 finals and has been selected to compete in the @entity154 heats for the face of the @entity157 pageant			1
@entity2 said : ' i want to be a role model and talk to people about mental illnesses			1

' if i can inspire just one person to turn their life around then everything i ’m doing will be worth it			0
i still have bad days and struggle , but then i think what i have achieved			0
' in a strange way i am grateful for what happened to me as now i can use it to help others			0
