he was pronounced dead at 12:11 a.m. in his final statement , @entity2 said : ‘ i 'm sorry to have to be the cause that brings you all into this dark business of execution			1
i pray for the victim 's family to have peace in their hearts one day and lose the anger , hate and need for revenge that has driven them			0
’ the victim 's father @entity57 also witnessed the execution along with his son and ex-wife , who fought back tears as he described how @entity2 strangled his daughter as he raped her 25 years ago			1
he said it took ‘ way too many years ’ to put him to death			2
' this basically tore two families apart , ’ he said after @entity2 's execution			1
‘ hopefully , now we can move forward			1
... @entity17 can rest now			2
’ on the night of the murder , @entity2 and a friend , @entity73 , were at a @entity75 service station across the street from the @entity20 gas station where @entity17 worked			1
strapped in : @entity2 was animated just before his execution as he lay strapped to a hospital gurney the teenager was nearing the end of her eight - hour shift when she went outside to check the levels of four fuel tanks			1
a witness said @entity2 's @entity86 pulled up and a man standing close to @entity17 had his hand in his pocket			1

about a half - hour later , co-workers went looking for @entity17 and contacted police when they realized she was n't home and her purse was still at the station			1
some of her clothes were later found in another town			0
nearly two weeks later , on feb. 22 , 1989 , @entity99 was approaching a machine shed on his farm in @entity102 , another @entity24 suburb , when he found @entity17 's body , naked except for socks			1

@entity16 switched to a one - drug execution method late last year			1
the state obtains the drug , pentobarbital , from a compounding pharmacy that it refuses to name			0
@entity2 's attorney , @entity166 , had argued that the state 's secretive process prohibited the public from knowing exactly how the drug was made and whether it could cause pain and suffering for the inmate			2
the same drug was used in the state 's four previous lethal injections			0
like @entity2 , those inmates also showed no outward signs of distress during the execution process			2
@entity16 executed just two men between 2005 and november			2
but after the state switched from a three - drug execution method to a single - drug protocol last year , executions resumed			2
although critics have raised concerns about the drug and the secretive ways @entity16 obtains and uses it to kill inmates , more executions are likely			0
experts say as many as 20 of @entity16 's 41 death row inmates have exhausted appeals and could also face execution dates soon , perhaps making 2014 the most prolific year ever for executions in the state			1
@entity16 executed nine men in 1999 , the most - ever in a single calendar year			1
on friday , the @entity200 set an april 23 execution date for @entity202 , who killed a @entity204 couple , both in their 60s , in 1993 .			0
