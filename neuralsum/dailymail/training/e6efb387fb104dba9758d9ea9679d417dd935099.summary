@entity0 are to get first sight of tens of thousands of job vacancies after ministers demanded an end to adverts being placed across the @entity6			1
@entity8 rules used to mean that any jobs advertised on the government ’s @entity10 had to be broadcast on an @entity6 - wide website used by migrants looking for work			1
but a deal struck between member states means that the jobs will now only be seen outside the @entity0 if employers request it			1
more than 4million searches are carried out every day , with half a million vacancies on the site			0
it replaced the old system of jobcentres advertising vacancies on cards in their windows			0
however , @entity6 rules meant that any of the adverts uploaded by 500,000 employers were replicated on an @entity6 - wide jobs portal called ‘ @entity45 ’			1
the @entity0 government called for changes to be made to ensure people already in the @entity0 saw the vacancies first			2
it comes as part of a crackdown on the ‘ pull factors ’ which attract @entity6 migrants to @entity0			1
the deal was struck by employment minister @entity22 during a meeting with her @entity58 counterparts in @entity8			1
she told @entity59 : ‘ we are giving businesses the choice of advertising their jobs only to @entity0 residents – it ’s only right that they get that choice			0
‘ under this government , @entity0 nationals have accounted for two - thirds of the rise in employment			0
with new vacancies being created every single day , we want to make sure people here get the first chance to secure those jobs too			0
‘ the new rules will significantly reduce the number of jobs advertised in @entity58 and put @entity0 residents first – and we will continue work with countries across @entity58 to ensure the system remains fair to jobseekers and to businesses			1
’ since the start of 2010 , the number of @entity0 people in work has risen by 961,635 , compared to a rise of 542,811 among @entity6 nationals and an extra 456,503 people from the rest of the world new figures released yesterday show that a record 30.8million people are in work in the @entity0			1

miss @entity22 added : ‘ behind these figures are individual stories of hard work and determination – stories of people turning their lives around , of families who are now feeling more secure over the @entity108 period with a regular wage			0
‘ if we can tip the scale more in their direction it ’s got to be a good thing			0
’ miss @entity22 has held talks with @entity117 , @entity118 , and @entity120 employment ministers to secure further agreement on changes to the jobs market			2
at the start of this year the government toughened the rules on foreign workers accessing jobs in the @entity0			0
