a new species of dinosaur discovered in @entity2 might have been named after a harmless puppet , but it was a fearsome ancient predators			2
the remains of the long - snouted tyrannosaur nicknamed @entity7 , which belonged to the same family as @entity10 , has been discovered by scientists			1
researchers believe the animal , which stalked the @entity14 more than 66 million years ago , was a terrifying carnivore that lived in @entity16 during the @entity17			1
a discovery not to be sniffed at : the remains of the long - snouted tyrannosaur @entity7 sinensis - nicknamed @entity7 ( pictured ) - which belonged to the same family as @entity10 , has been discovered by scientists in @entity2 the bones were discovered by workmen on a construction site in the city of @entity25 in southern @entity2			1
they took them to a local museum , after which experts from the @entity30 and the @entity31 became involved in examining the bones			0
palaeontologists had been uncertain about the existence of long - snouted tyrannosaurs until the remains of the dinosaur - whose proper name is @entity7 - were unearthed			1
. with an elongated skull and long , narrow teeth , the newly - found predator would have looked very different from a @entity10 , which had thick teeth and more powerful jaws			1
it is thought that @entity7 lived alongside other tyrannosaurs but would not have been in direct competition with them , since they probably hunted different prey			2
new species is not a lie : palaeontologists had been uncertain about the existence of long - snouted tyrannosaurs until the remains of the dinosaur were unearthed in southern @entity2			1
just two other skeletons of juveniles have been found before but it was unclear at to whether they were a ' new ' species one of the authors of the study , dr @entity62 of @entity31 's @entity63 , said : ‘ this is a different breed of tyrannosaur			0
it has the familiar toothy grin of @entity10 , but its snout was much longer and it had a row of horns on its nose			0
@entity74 ( left ) and @entity62 ( right ) , confirmed the existence of @entity7 , which belonged to the same family as @entity10 ‘ it might have looked a little comical , but it would have been as deadly as any other tyrannosaur , and maybe even a little faster and stealthier			2
’ ‘ it is an awesome specimen , almost a complete skeleton			0
it is a really one in a million find that those workers made			0
’ the newly discovered specimen is of an animal nearing adulthood			0
it was found largely intact and ‘ remarkably well preserved , the experts said			0
before this find just two fossilised tyrannosaurs with elongated heads had been pulled from the @entity14 , but since they were juveniles it was unclear whether they were from a new class of dinosaur or if they were simply at an early growth stage			2
researchers have now created a new branch of the tyrannosaur family for specimens with very long snouts and they expect more dinosaurs to be added to the group as excavations in @entity16 continue to identify new species			0
professor @entity107 , of the @entity108 , @entity30 , said : ‘ the new discovery is very important			0
along with @entity110 from @entity111 , it shows that the long - snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed in @entity16			2
‘ although we are only starting to learn about them , the long - snouted tyrannosaurs were apparently one of the main groups of predatory dinosaurs in @entity16			1
’ details of the study are published in the journal @entity121			0
