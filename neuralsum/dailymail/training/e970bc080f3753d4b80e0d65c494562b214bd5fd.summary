bodies of dead puffins have been found washed up on the bays of @entity3 and @entity4 , provoking worries that the storms have thinned their numbers thousands of puffins are feared to have been killed in the recent storms that have hammered the @entity10 for the last month			1
the @entity11 said today it ’s received a record number of reports of puffins , wearing uniquely - numbered metal rings showing they are from the @entity10 , being washed up dead on the coasts of @entity3 and @entity4			1
it ’s feared they have been wiped out in their thousands while hunting far out to sea in the storm - lashed @entity21 for their favourite food , sand eels			1
@entity11 spokesman @entity26 said : ' sadly , the sight of a puffin , beak full of sand eels , might be a little harder to come by this summer as they struggle to survive the recent storms that have rocked the @entity21			2
' in a normal winter , the @entity11 would expect two or three ringed puffins to be found in the @entity21 , which covers western @entity3 and northern @entity4 , but during the last few weeks , more than 35 have been reported and countless more are feared to have been drowned and lost forever far out at sea			1
the previous highest number of ringed birds found was back in 1979 when 17 dead puffins were reported			0
@entity38 puffins head out into the @entity39 for the winter months , riding out the worst that the weather can throw at them			2
as the winter progresses , they make their way back into the @entity21 before heading home to their breeding colonies and the burrows and tunnels in the ground on clifftops that they used the previous summer			2
the @entity11 says that puffins found in this winter ’s so - called ‘ wreck ’ , have come from colonies in west @entity58 , northern @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
@entity62 , ringing officer at the @entity11 , said ' up until the last couple of weeks it seemed that our puffins might have survived the worst of the winter			0
normal winters would have brought 3 or 4 puffins to the @entity21 , but this winter saw 35 , with countless more thought to have drowned in the ocean the previous high number of puffins found on the bay , 17 back in 1979 , has been shattered this year ' however , from the reports of ringed birds that are being washed up on the @entity80 beaches it would seem that the recent storms were just too much for many of the puffins			1
' it is still early days and the number of ringed birds found is likely to rise further , but we must remember that if over 35 ringed birds have been found , many un-ringed birds must have been affected too			0
' bird ringing in the @entity10 is organised by the @entity11 and is carried out by licensed volunteers , who ring over a million birds of a wide variety of different species every year			0
it is the information received from these rings , when found and reported to the @entity11 , that enables scientists at the @entity11 to chart events such as this .			0

record numbers of puffins have been washed up on @entity21
a few die each year , but recently many more have died *due* to storm weather
drowning is common cause of death for the puffins
they are often *swept* away in strong storms while hunting at sea
