two particularly hungry , exotic termite species have apparently found love halfway around the world , causing concern for scientists			2
@entity6 and @entity7 subterranean termites , two of the most destructive termite species on the planet , are could be mating in @entity11			1
they are producing hybrid colonies of ' super termites ' that are growing at twice the normal rate			1
@entity6 ( pictured ) and @entity7 subterranean termites , two of the most destructive termite species on the planet , are could be mating in @entity18 are producing hybrid colonies of ' super termites ' that are growing at twice the normal rate together , @entity6 and @entity7 subterranean termites , are responsible for much of the estimated $ 40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually			1
the @entity7 termites originated in @entity24 but now are established throughout the @entity25 and blamed for roughly $ 300m in property damage each year in @entity27 alone			1
@entity6 termites normally found in tropical south - eastern @entity6 have spread to @entity29 , the @entity30 and south @entity11			1
@entity6 termites are not expected to spread farther north in the @entity32 than south @entity11 because they do not tolerate colder weather / however , a hybrid might be able to thrive in a greater range than either species alone			1
their habitat ranges overlap in lush south @entity11 , already home to a daunting number of invasive plant and animal species thriving where they should not			0
each termite invaded @entity11 several decades ago , but experts believed the colonies did n't mingle because their above ground mating swarms launched in different months			0
that is , until @entity52 researcher @entity51 noticed something unusual about the termite swarms in his @entity56 neighbourhood two years ago			2
the two species were flying around looking for mates at the same time â€“ and they were giving each other that look			2
the research is preliminary and leaves many questions unanswered , but the idea of a hybrid termite carrying the destructive capabilities of two invasive species worries experts			0
' that 's big news , ' said @entity69 , an entomologist at the @entity32 @entity70			0
' they 're two bad ones , too			0
' @entity51 is the lead author of a study published this week i the journal @entity75 detailing observations of @entity6 and @entity7 termite swarms in downtown @entity56			1
in the field , including @entity51 's own yard , researchers documented the two species swarming at the same time and in the same places			2
the same behaviour was documented again last year , and @entity51 said he is seeing again this spring			0
' what we did n't expect to see was when they 're in the same place at the same time , we saw the male @entity6 subterranean termites looking for the female @entity7 termites in the field , ' @entity51 said			1
together , @entity6 and @entity7 ( pictured ) subterranean termites , are responsible for much of the estimated $ 40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually ' when we put them in vials and brought them back to the lab , to our biggest surprise they started laying eggs and the eggs started growing			1
' the resulting ' hybrid ' colony in the lab grew more vigorously than colonies produced by either species alone , researchers said			2
genetic analysis confirmed they were looking at a hybrid species			0
similar hybridisation has been documented in invasive bee and fire ant species , but not in termites			2
the two termite species also are found together on the island of @entity115 in @entity116 and in @entity117 , but the simultaneous swarms and hybridisation found in @entity11 appear to be a new phenomenon			0
it is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in @entity56 , or whether the hybrids bred in the lab can reproduce			1
it is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in @entity56 in the south of @entity11 female termites can lay millions of eggs , but it takes five to eight years for a colony to produce the mature adults that fly in the mating swarms			1
' let 's keep our fingers crossed that they 're not able [ to reproduce ] and that they 're donkey termites , ' said @entity69 , who reviewed the data but did not participate in the @entity52 study			0
even if hybrid termites can not reproduce , they could cause damage over many years			0
alone , each species is a challenge to control			0
their below - ground colonies are bigger than those of native termites and can be hard to find			0
liquid insecticides injected into the soil or baited traps are effective ways for homeowners to fight back against @entity6 and @entity7 termites , and those methods should work against any hybrid , @entity69 said			1
the termite species are found together on the island of @entity115 in @entity116 and in @entity117 , but the simultaneous swarms and hybridisation found in @entity11 appear to be a new phenomenon			0
pictured is an @entity6 termite			2

@entity6 and @entity7 termites have been found *breeding* for the first time
they are producing ' super termites ' that can grow at twice the normal rate
it is unknown whether the colony has survived the wild in @entity56
