by @entity1 reporter published : 15:07 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 24 may 2013 a group of students who came up with an electrically conductive paint for an art project using research from @entity8 are seeing their product take off around the the world			1
four years ago the @entity12 students created the substance that allows you to paint working light switch directly onto your wall , without any need for sockets , cables or wiring			1
the paint acts as a form of liquid wiring and , unlike conventional wires , it can be applied to almost any surface , including paper , plastic , metal and even fabric			1
a group of @entity12 students created this @entity32 - like substance that allows you to paint liquid wiring onto any surface @entity37 's @entity36 contains two paper houses , wired with conductive paint , which light up in the dark the product has the appearance and consistency of runny @entity32 , but dries quickly when exposed to the air			1
its inventors , @entity12 graduates @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , call their creation ' @entity52			1
' while they do n't claim to be the first group to have invented a conductive ink , they are pioneering new ways it can be used , @entity53 reported			2
@entity47 said : ' we started this project in earnest in 2009			2
we were originally interested in trying to apply electronics to the skin ... so we arrived at this idea of applying them as a coating and eventually we got this idea of a conductive paint			2
' in 2008 -- and probably still today -- there was a lot of work around electronic textiles			2
and though we really liked the idea of having a jumper ( a piece of clothing ) that has some intelligence in it , we did n't like that it was so bulky and that once you took it off the functionality disappeared			2
' around the same time there was a lot of ' extreme work ' being done by people who were injecting electronics beneath the skin			0
for their final project , the @entity12 students began work on making something less intrusive , looking for a substance that could be painted onto the body			1
@entity37 's @entity47 travelled to @entity92 and ran a workshop with @entity95 students at the @entity96 @entity97 and producer @entity98 mounted a project with @entity100 , with painted dancers whose movements triggered loops from @entity98 's hit song @entity104 designer @entity105 developed a conductive paint - powered lamp for the 2012 @entity108			1
the lamp consists of a layer of liquid paint suspended in oil mr @entity47 said : ' that idea transformed into the material we have now , which is very safe though it 's not specifically intended for the body anymore			1
' after graduating from college , the team collaborated on a video for @entity97 and producer @entity98			0
the resulting project was the ' @entity120 , ' a performance which literally brought the paint to life , with dancers whose movements triggered audio loops from @entity98 's song ' @entity104			0
' the company has created a collection of prototype posters that respond to touch			1
when activated , the posters play audio , which they hope might be used in poster campaigns promoting festivals , music , tv shows and film @entity47 , co-inventor of @entity37 , said : ' making a new material was a bit daunting for four designers			0
' so , the team went on @entity8			0
according to @entity47 , the online encyclopedia provided them with almost everything they needed to know about crafting conductive materials			0
once the paint 's formula was finalised , co-creator @entity46 says the team began to consider how it might be applied to real - world products			1
the first thing they launched was the paint in its raw form , which they made available to other garden - shed inventors , @entity53 reported			2
today , @entity52 jars and pens are sold on the internet and stocked by electronics stores around the world			0
projects being done by @entity52 users include everything from interactive color wheels to homemade electric toys			0
mr @entity47 said that conductive paint opens up an enormous range of creative opportunities			0
as conductive paint becomes increasingly common , we can look forward to a future where billboards talk back , walls are interactive , and greeting cards come to life in our very hands			0
mr @entity47 added : ' devices no longer have to look high tech to be high tech. our goal is to put interactivity onto objects you do n't expect			0

@entity12 students in @entity186 created the substance
it acts as a form of liquid wiring that can be applied to almost any surface
