by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:34 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 07:43 est , 3 may 2013 @entity4 's long journey to rehab took a bizarre twist on thursday - when the actress changed her mind about checking in to a treatment facility at the last minute			1
@entity4 was scheduled to enter rehab on thursday morning to begin her 90 days of court - ordered treatment			1
but the troubled starlet is reported to been ' spooked ' by the amount of paparazzi waiting outside the @entity15 in @entity16 , and refused to check into the facility			2
law enforcement sources now tell @entity19 that prosecutors will seek an arrest warrant for @entity4 if she 's not back in rehab by sunrise			1
on the run : @entity4 has failed to enter the rehab facility as ordered by the court and is at risk of being arrested again checking in : according to reports @entity4 entered the @entity29 centre at 8.45am to start her 90 day stint under fire : it has been claimed that @entity15 can not offer treatment after its licence was revoked @entity4 's whereabouts are currently unknown			1
a source told @entity37 that @entity4 has apparently been saying for the past six hours that she is ' going to return to the rehab facility but she has n't yet			1
' ' she felt @entity15 was not suitable for her , ' another source told @entity40 about @entity4 's decision to leave			2
' there were too many paparazzi everywhere and she did n't feel safe			0
' nobody close to her is happy about this			0
they think she 's really not being smart			0
' @entity4 's decision to leave rehab came while her lawyer @entity48 was in court telling a judge that she had entered the facility at 8.45am			1
mixing things up : @entity4 is reportedly unhappy with her lawyer @entity48 's progress with the case , and has hired back her former lawyer @entity55 could face arrest : @entity4 ’s failure to check in to the facility is likely a violation of her recent plea deal @entity4 's @entity61 arrived at the @entity29 facility but the vehicle left with @entity4 still inside , according to @entity19			1
@entity37 , however , reports that @entity4 did in fact walk through the doors of the facility , but left just a few minutes later			1
' she told people there that she did n't need rehab , ' a source told @entity37			0
' and then she left			0
' @entity4 's father @entity72 also confirmed to @entity37 that his daughter never checked in			2
' i have no other choice than to get this out there to help @entity4 , ' he said			2
backing out : an image has been released which appears to show @entity4 and her luggage arriving at the facility retail therapy : at 8.45am , 15 minutes after she was due to check into her rehab facility , @entity4 was seen shopping at @entity84 's electronics store @entity4 was spotted at a @entity85 in @entity86 at 8.45am , while at the same time her lawyer @entity48 was in court asserting she had already checked into rehab			1
after refusing to check into @entity15 , @entity4 allegedly insisted on being taken back to the airport because she wanted to fly to @entity91			2
' she was saying , " i 'm not going to rehab			0
i 'm not going to rehab			0
take me back to the airport , " ' a source told the @entity93			0
but @entity4 's desire to return to @entity91 is likely a violation of her recent plea deal , which could lead to an arrest warrant being issued			1
@entity99 's finest : police were seen surrounding @entity15 as @entity4 checked in ' if there ’s credible confirmation she ’s heading back to @entity91 , then i ’m going to have to go in and ask the court to issue a warrant , ” @entity102 city attorney @entity101 said			1
and the actress ' father @entity72 told @entity37 : ' if that ’s the case i have been told that she will be arrested in @entity91 and her bail will be set at $ 100,000			2
' @entity72 also told the @entity93 that he had spoken to @entity4 before the flight to @entity91 took off , pleading with her not to get on it			2
' she said , " @entity115 , how can they arrest me ? " i got her just before she left , ' said @entity72			0
staying put : the @entity118 star will stay in the @entity29 facility until a decision has been made by the court final moments of freedom : on wednesday @entity4 spent her last day before rehab shopping and chain - smoking and in a bid to avoid an arrest warrant being issued , @entity4 is reported to have re-hired the lawyer she sensationally fired earlier this year			1
@entity19 reports that @entity4 has been unimpressed with @entity48 's work on her case , and pleaded ith @entity55 to return			1
according to the website , @entity132 agreed to return as @entity4 's lawyer , and has since been talking to prosecutors in a bid to avoid them issuing a warrant for the actress ' arrest			1
as well as telling the judge that @entity4 had already checked into rehab , @entity48 also had to plead with the judge to get the okay that @entity15 would be a suitable facility for the actress to complete her treatment in			1
revoked : the @entity16 rehab centre allegedly can only act as a sober living facility and treat outpatients @entity4 had originally been scheduled to complete her 90 - day treatment at the @entity152 rehabilitation facility in @entity91 after pleading no contest to charges of lying to police about driving during a car crash last june , but @entity72 appeared to have put the actress off the rehab centre			1
' i told her it ’s like a motel , and you share a room and have a plastic shower curtain			0
you ca n’t smoke , you ca n’t leave the property			0
she said , “ what ? ! ’ ” he told the @entity93			0
going to a different centre unapproved by the court technically broke her plea agreement , meaning the star ’s attorney was required to appear before a judge			2
@entity48 , who wore an eyesore of a tie in red and black stripes for the hearing , was attempting to convince judge @entity178 to approve of the switch			0
@entity4 's living quarters : the rehab facility features quaint interiors , as this photograph reveals in and out : @entity4 allegedly left the plush rehab facility after ' a few minutes ' he argued that as @entity4 has already entered and is ‘ ensconced ’ in the program , it could effect her recovery should she have to move facilities			1
‘ she 's going to be meeting with a psychiatrist later today , ’ @entity48 explained , reinforcing that the star is ‘ commencing immediate treatment			0
' the news comes amid claims that the centre in fact does not even have a licence to offer residential treatment as it was revoked in may 2012			1
according to @entity19 , @entity15 had their licence suspended after they were found to be careless with prescription drugs and went beyond the constraints of the licence			0
starting off on the right foot : @entity48 claims that @entity4 will be meeting with a psychiatrist later in the day looking out for @entity4 : @entity48 told judge @entity206 that it would be a bad idea to move his client already the deputy director of licensing and certificates at the @entity212 told the website : ‘ @entity15 can not give any treatment , ’ as the rehab centre is allegedly only allowed to provide a sober living facility			1
but @entity15 released a statement on thursday claiming the facility does in fact have a licence to provide drug and alcohol treatment			0
the facility 's ceo @entity223 said the 2011 revocation of @entity15 's licence only hinders the centre 's ability to provide detox services to residents			1
the judge however did n’t seem to have too many qualms about the switch to that particular facility , despite the fact that it was not on a list of six centres approved by the court			2
convincing : @entity4 chose a rehab centre which was not approved by the court so @entity48 was attempting to get the judge to ok the decision fighting his corner : the switch to a different rehab technically violates @entity4 's plea agreement and now the centre must be approved ‘ it does appear to comply , ’ judge @entity178 said , adding that the prosecution had eight days to decide whether or not they will agree with the centre being approved			1
‘ i do n't have any problems with miss @entity4 remaining in this program until the issue is resolved , ’ he said			0
‘ if we decide the program does not meet the requirements of the plea agreement then she will have to move to a different program			0
’ he explained : ' the issue is going to be whether or not we need to set a hearing because the people are complaining [ the centre ] does not fit the parameters			0
' @entity48 and @entity101 of the prosecution will reconvene in front of the judge on may 10 , at which point it will be determined whether or not they will set a date for a restitution hearing			0
@entity4 's lawyer said he has faith that @entity15 would be approved , even though @entity101 claimed he had three separate news articles which showed the facility in a bad light			1
' 90 days and 270 looks ' : @entity4 posted a picture of herself packing for her stay in rehab on @entity279 on tuesday night ' if [ @entity101 ] says he 's satisfied then i do n't think we have to come back , ' @entity48 said , adding , ' i 'm 100 % sure he will be satisfied			2
' @entity48 then claimed that he will ' make sure [ @entity4 ] stays in therapy ' , and had called in the coo of @entity15 in the hope that she could win over @entity101			0
the judge later stated that @entity4 will not have to appear in court as the case continues ' as long as she is in compliance '			2
in addition , none of the star 's progress reports are to be released to the public aside from ' proof of completion ' at the end of her stay .			0
