by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:50 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:42 est , 23 december 2013 in the middle of the @entity4 lies a ghost town , which is out of bounds to the public for most of the year			1
but at @entity12 , @entity9 church in the village of @entity11 opens its doors for a rare @entity15 service , allowing people the chance to access the town that has been @entity20 property for 70 years			2
on december 21 , churchgoers were allowed to see the houses that are now used exclusively for military training during the fifth annual carol service in the 13th - century church			2
the @entity45 also attended the service in the village , which was chosen as a training ground for its remote location			2
one week before christmas 1943 , villagers were evacuated and their @entity51 was requisitioned by the @entity52			1
they were given just under two months to clear out - but were told that they would be allowed to return , amid praise from the government for the sacrifice they were making			0
but the war finished and all of the land and property in the village remained in @entity52 hands			0
in the 1950s , the @entity52 - which was to become the @entity20 - took on responsibility for the upkeep and repair of the church itself			2
haven : the village is in an explosive ' high impact ' area , but that did n't dampen the festive cheer in the church , which included music from the @entity75 merry @entity12 : despite the stark , military location , churchgoers and carol singers at the sold - out service were all smiles outside the 13th - century building it held that responsibility until 2002 , when it was turned over to the @entity85			1
but the @entity38 remains in control of the site and restricts access to it , meaning it is only open for up to 50 days every year for church services - many around the @entity12 period			1
the entire village is a designated high explosive ' impact area ' in the @entity4 military training zone , and the village sits in the middle of it			1
it is surrounded by a 10ft chain fence , locked gate and ' out of bounds ' and ' danger ' notices			0
pubs and a manor house in the village stand empty and derelict , many of them reduced to concrete shells			0
ghost town : purpose - build @entity20 houses for training exercises stand alongside the shells of former @entity11 buildings , and form what has been a ghost town for 70 years guns : old tanks are dotted across the @entity4 and are used as part of the ' scenery ' for military exercises around @entity11 drive by : during the rare opening periods , visitors are allowed a glimpse of both a wartime town and given an insight into @entity20 training in this haunting location , which was originally requisitioned for d - day landings training purpose - built @entity20 buildings have since been added to the village for training			1
the @entity133 * listed church with its 15th - century murals is the only building to have escaped the fate of @entity11 's other buildings			0
@entity11 opens for several services over @entity12 , with roads to @entity11 open between 4pm on december 20 and 8am on january 6 - subject , of course , to ' urgent operational need '			1
tickets were required for the carol service due to overwhelming popularity , although the village is still open to other visitors during this period			0
tradition : carols were accompanied by the brass band and by hand - bell ringers as people sang in the centuries - old , unheated church cut off : normal military operations will resume on january 6 and @entity11 will be closed again - and in the meantime , drivers and churchgoers are warned to stay on the paths for fear of discarded explosives historic : the 13th - century church is adorned on the inside with beautiful 15th - century murals and is the only building in the village to be undamaged by guns and time sneak peek : the manor house is gated off and abandoned , but can be seen by peering through the bolted metal barriers and gates that surround @entity11 and many of its buildings the guns in @entity11 also fall silent on the feast of @entity9 in september every year			1
the december 21 service included performances by the @entity75 and the @entity179 - and churchgoers were all given a glass of mulled wine and a mince pie			0
@entity184 is cared for by the @entity185 , a national charity protecting historic churches at risk			0
