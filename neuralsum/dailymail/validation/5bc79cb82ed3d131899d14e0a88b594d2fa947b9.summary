keeping up a quick pace to the finish line , @entity0 did n't look like someone who had walked nearly 240 miles in the footsteps of frontiersman @entity5 , an arduous trip through the @entity8 terrain that was inspired by his own family 's pioneering roots in the @entity12 wilderness			1
the @entity14 steel mill worker , toting a 40 - pound backpack , completed his 16 - day journey on thursday			1
it started in @entity18 , wound into @entity19 and took him to hallowed ground in @entity12 — the place where @entity23 was built in 1775 after @entity5 and his band of axe men had carved out @entity26			1
the path became an important early artery for settlers heading westward			2
' i ca n't wait to sit down , ' the 46 - year - old @entity30 said after being greeted by family and other supporters			1
' i have n't had a soft chair in a long time			0
physically , i feel fine			0
i feel like any other day i would get up for work			2
... i could keep going if i wanted , but i do n't want to			0
' traveler : @entity30 smiles as he arrives at the site of the original @entity23 , @entity12 on thursday march 26 , 2015 sweet reunion : @entity30 kisses his wife @entity39 at the finish on thursday @entity41 embraced her father and then teasingly told him : ' you do n't smell too bad			1
' during his adventure , @entity0 slept outside , crossed rivers on foot , trudged through rain and mud and endured blistered feet			0
he started his journey on march 10 near @entity53 , @entity18 — the same place where @entity5 's group left in march 1775			1
@entity0 followed the famous frontiersman 's route into @entity19 and through @entity58 into @entity12			1
after five days of traveling alone , @entity0 was joined by walking companion @entity59 , 42 , near the @entity19 - @entity12 border			1
@entity63 's father , @entity62 , is president of @entity64 , a nonprofit group that hopes to preserve the historic route as a hiking trail and a memorial to the pioneers			0
' @entity69 started on this road , ' @entity30 said			1
his trip was inspired by his fifth - great grandfather , @entity72 , who followed @entity73 on his way to @entity23			1
' this is where @entity76 came in 1779 , ' @entity30 said			1
' so he would have been right here somewhere in this little area			0
' his ancestor did quite well for himself in the frontier			0
he eventually acquired 1,400 acres near @entity81 in central @entity12 , but later parceled it off and sold it , @entity0 said			1
@entity72 eventually became a plantation owner in @entity19			1
among those welcoming @entity0 and @entity59 on their arrival was @entity86 , who said some of her ancestors were among the settlers at @entity23			1
their names are among those etched on a monument honoring the pioneers			0
' anybody that would spend this many days to get here certainly has an understanding of what our ancestors did to make all of this available to us now , ' @entity95 said			0
' i just think that 's a wonderful for someone to do , to raise our level of awareness			0
' trek : @entity0 , left and his walking partner @entity59 walk @entity110 following the @entity111 near @entity23 on thursday			1
@entity30 ' 5th great grandfather , @entity72 , was one of @entity5 's men who walked to @entity23 in 1775 and helped blaze a trail from @entity58 to the fort explorer : @entity5 and his band of axe men had carved out @entity73 in the 1700s			1
the path became an important early artery for settlers heading westward at the start of his trip , @entity0 said , he was determined to ' rough it , ' just like the pioneers			2
on his first day , he waded across seven streams and rivers on foot , including one that was knee deep			2
' i quickly found out that by getting your feet wet and then continuing to walk , you could get what the pioneers called " scalded feet , " ' he said			0
the foot blisters were enough to dissuade him from river crossings and take the bridges instead			0
he endured steady rain during his first four days			0
at the end of one day , he started shivering uncontrollably , he said			2
' rather than end my trip there , i bit the bullet and i decided to stop in at a motel and dry off and warm up , ' he said			2
' that was kind of a low point			0
i had tried to do this			0
sleeping under the stars , fording the rivers , carrying all my own food			0
' his attitude changed after a park ranger told him the pioneers stopped at settlements for food , warm places to sleep and to resupply before reaching the @entity12 wilderness			2
after that , he said , he accepted the generosity from people offering meals and places to sleep , including carports and garages			0
with help from groups including @entity168 , @entity0 charted the most historically accurate route for his journey			2
@entity0 said he got lost just once , on a mountainside in @entity19			2
he estimated about 60 percent of his trip was on roads and the rest through woodlands or fields			2
while the early pioneers faced dangers from @entity181 , @entity0 's biggest threat was vehicles on roads that lacked shoulders for him and @entity59 to walk on			0
' when a large truck would come by , we had this little technique where we would lean ( on their walking sticks ) into the ditch and away from the road , just long enough for them to go by , and then we 'd pop back out on the road , ' he said			0
@entity0 planned to visit @entity5 's grave in @entity12 's capital city of @entity196 and then return home to @entity198 , @entity14			1
you did it ! @entity86 , left , congratulates @entity30 as he arrives at the original site of @entity23 on thursday			1
