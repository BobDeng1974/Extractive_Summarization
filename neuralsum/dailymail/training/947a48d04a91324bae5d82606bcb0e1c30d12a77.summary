by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity5 immigration from @entity6 has driven down wages in parts of @entity9 and put pressure on essential services , the government 's official advisors have warned			1
a new report by the @entity13 said some areas of the country are ' struggling to cope ' with high levels of immigration that have put pressures on public services like the @entity19 , schools and transport			1
the committee found in some areas of the country where there has been an influx of foreign workers there was a ' negative impact on the wages of the low paid '			1
it also attacked the weak ' compliance and enforcement ' of the minimum wage - with poor inspections and ' feeble ' penalties			1
the report added : ' an employer can expect a visit from @entity41 once every 250 years and a prosecution once in a million years '			1
the @entity13 's report showed how more @entity9 were leaving than moving back to the country from abroad			1
at the same time around 200,000 foreigners came to the @entity9 every year the report also revealed that low skilled men and women had been badly hit since 1997			2
in total , there are now a million fewer low skilled @entity9 workers in jobs than there were when @entity54 came to powert home secretary @entity56 's official immigration advisors today warned that poorly paid workers in some parts of @entity9 were seeing their wages eroded by cheap foreign labour the @entity13 attacked the education system for failing to prepare children for work			1
it said this was leaving @entity9 youngsters unable to compete against better qualified immigrants			0
sir @entity67 - the committee 's chair - said the @entity70 target for school pupils to achieve five or more gcses at grades a to @entity74 meant schools could not ' devote resources to the top end and bottom end of the ability range '			0
as a result , less academically talented pupils were not prepared for the world of work , he said			0
companies take on immigrants because their literacy and numeracy is better than young @entity9 candidates , he added			0
sir @entity67 said many firms also believe @entity9 workers are less good at ' getting out of bed in the morning ' for shift work and dealing with customers politely			2
a spokesman for the committee said : ' the arrival of one million migrants in low - skilled jobs during the last 10 years has left local authorities struggling to cope with rapid population change			1
' the official report revealed that some 75 per cent of the 2.9 million rise in the foreign - born population in the past decade was concentrated in just a quarter of @entity106 councils - putting pressure on housing and public services in those areas			2
one study of pay in @entity114 , the report said , had found the 20 per cent lowest paid had seen wages fall by 15 per cent on average			2
it added that schools in some areas of the country had seen a ' marked increase in the number of migrant pupils ' , adding that this may ' impose additional costs '			0
overall , the report stated : ' the impacts of migrants on average wages			0
. tended to be positive at the top of the wage distribution and negative at the bottom			2
' @entity54 mp @entity132 said : ' this report sheds a small amount of light on what has been blindingly obvious for a long time to people at the bottom			0
' the committee warned that future @entity141 expansion – with eight candidate countries containing 90 million people earning a third to half of average @entity141 wage levels – needed to be managed better than before			2
figures from the @entity146 shows in 2013 there were 2.1 million people from overseas working in low - skilled occupations			2
of these , 1.2 million were born outside of the @entity141			0
but @entity41 and the @entity152 , the two major enforcement bodies designed to protect vulnerable workers , are under - resourced and their penalties are too weak to tackle the exploitation of migrant workers in low - skilled jobs			1
professor sir @entity67 , chair of the @entity13 , said : ' our flexible labour market has served us well			2
but vulnerable low - skilled workers , whether @entity9 or foreign , need protection			1
' there is incomplete compliance with and enforcement of labour regulations , and regulatory resources and penalties are inadequate			0
' the @entity13 released a map showing that low skilled @entity169 immigrants were concentrated in @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity114 - with much of the @entity172 and @entity173 barely touched @entity175 leader @entity174 told the @entity176 that @entity9 could vote to stay in the @entity141 if free movement was scrapped sir @entity67 added : ' a typical employer can expect a compliance visit just once in 250 years and a prosecution once in a million years			1
' we must also redouble our efforts to equip our young people with the skills to compete in a flexible job market			0
' across the country , the report found that migrant workers over the last 20 years have not had a ' major impact ' on the pay of @entity9 workers or on people 's prospects of finding a job			1
a government spokeswoman today defended the enforcement of the minimum wage			0
she said : ' the vast majority of employers pay the minimum wage			0
our targeted , intelligence - led approach shows us that non-compliance on the adult rate is less than 0.8 per cent			0
' for those that do n’t comply the government has taken action			0
to deter flouters , we have quadrupled the financial penalties up to £ 20,000 per employee and named and shamed 30 employers for failing to pay the basic rate			1
@entity41 act on every minimum wage complaint reported and last year alone found £ 4.65 million in back pay owed to over 22,600 workers			1
' we recognise there is more to do and are working across @entity70 to see what further action is needed to prevent illegal working			0
