by @entity1 reporter an @entity3 music festival meant , in part , as a nod to the 1969 's @entity6 , was canceled sunday due to torrential rains sweeping through the area			1
the @entity9 was meant to last from july 11 to july 13 , but sunday evening 's acts including @entity11 were rained out			1
the music was supposed to go on at least through the early morning hours monday , but rains turned the @entity14 campground into a muddy scene more reminiscent of the summer of 1994 's famously sloppy @entity6 followup than the summer of love			1
mud bath : the music at the @entity9 was supposed to go on at least through the early morning hours monday , but rains turned the @entity14 campground into a muddy scene more reminiscent of the summer of 1994 's famously sloppy @entity6 followup than the summer of love the @entity22 reports that promoters @entity23 made the call to suspend the show at around 4:45pm			1
' based on the recommendation from @entity28 and information from the @entity30 concerning approaching storms , in conjunction with the previous afternoon inclement weather , we have decided to cancel this evening â€™s performances , ' @entity23 posted on the festival website			2
nonetheless , photos from the festival on sunday show revelers getting down and dirty and making the most of the filthy festivities			2
mud - covered hills became the perfect sledding slopes men and women slipped and slid their way to a good time even without a musical accompaniment			0
not so bummed : festival goers did their best to have fun in spite of the weather by playing in the mud cut short : a couple kiss in the rain in the middle of a mud pit after severe early afternoon thunderstorms sunday @entity6 : the festival was held at the same @entity3 farm as @entity6 , which became known as @entity6 to many attendees one shot showed two men , one of them proudly holding aloft a liquor bottle , as they careened down a muddy hill in a children 's wagon			1
promoters were sure to note that , while the show was canceled , the more intoxicated among the concert goers were welcome to stay in their cars to sleep off the booze and wait out the storm			0
' you do not need to leave if you are not sober , we are not asking anyone to drive drunk			0
if you are unable to leave the venue for any reason , please stay in your vehicles until the storm passes or you can depart safely , ' reads the announcement			0
initially the evening 's acts were only suspended , but as the day wore on it appears the threat of storms was enough to cancel the rest of the festivities altogether			0
risky ? while some of the muddy games looked harmless , some of the revelers may have been taking more risks than others ' you do not need to leave if you are not sober , we are not asking anyone to drive drunk			2
if you are unable to leave the venue for any reason , please stay in your vehicles until the storm passes or you can depart safely , ' read the cancellation announcement			0

the @entity9 festival took place in the same @entity14 , @entity3 farm as @entity6
