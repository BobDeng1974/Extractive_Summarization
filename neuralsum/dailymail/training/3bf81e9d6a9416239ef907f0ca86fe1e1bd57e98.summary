by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent in @entity2 and @entity3 published : 11:40 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 01:37 est , 23 may 2013 @entity4 today hailed a breakthrough in talks to secure an @entity8 - wide deal on sharing information to stop multi-national firms avoiding paying tax			1
the prime minister said @entity14 agreement had been reached on tackling tax evasion and avoidance , after warning countries face ' staggering ' losses			2
it is thought @entity22 and @entity23 - the only opponents of tax transparency - have agreed to back the plan if @entity25 will also do so			1
@entity4 is in @entity2 today for talks on tax avoidance , where he spoke to @entity29 president @entity28 , right , @entity31 's prime minister @entity30 , second left , and @entity33 prime minister @entity32 mr @entity4 wants to see companies reporting where they pay tax country - by - country , across the @entity14 and the @entity38			1
however there is a risk that some @entity14 countries will want to set up their own , separate , system			0
large - scale tax avoidance schemes are estimated to cost the @entity14 alone £ 850 billion a year			1
speaking at a summit in @entity2 today , mr @entity4 said @entity14 leaders had achieved ' a proper agreement , here in the @entity14 to start with , that all countries should exchange tax information , that all countries should act on beneficial ownership , so we know who owns what			1
i think this is a big step forward			0
' the prime minister said the @entity14 had persuaded @entity22 and @entity23 to drop their complete opposition to tax transparency			1
' today we 've agreed to push for a new international standard of automatic information exchange between tax authorities and to help those authorities fight tax evasion with new standards to give them info on who really owns and controls each and every company , ' he said			2
' tax evasion is illegal and should be cracked down on as rapidly as possible			2
of course governments should more to turn aggressive tax avoidance schemes into tax evasion by making them illegal			1
' but no government in the world can move fast enough to catch up with some of practices put in place by some businesses and individuals			0
' there is a moral issue - companies have to make decisions about themselves			1
my decision to put this on top of the @entity38 agenda has unlocked some really important international action			0
' finance ministers from 17 @entity14 countries including @entity93 and @entity94 have already signed a declaration backing the global system , but 11 have not and long - standing opposition has been driven by @entity23 and @entity22 , where banking secrecy is traditionally sacred			1
@entity100 's new coalition government has shelved plans to join the @entity14			2
the centre - right progressive and @entity104 parties halted accession talks and promised a referendum before continuing the application			0
new premier @entity108 said : ' the government intends to halt negotiations between @entity100 and the @entity14			0
we will not hold further negotiations with the @entity14 without prior referendum			0
' mr @entity4 was also at pains to claim that he raised tax avoidance ' very directly ' with @entity117 boss @entity116 at a meeting this week			1
@entity119 made clear on monday that the prime minister would not refer to reports the search engine firm paid only £ 10 million in corporation tax in the @entity93 between 2006 and 2011 , despite revenues of £ 11.9 billion			0
however , this morning deputy prime minister @entity125 revealed that he did raise public anger with firms which are not seen to be paying their ' fair share ' of tax ' with the @entity117 chairman			0
he said ' companies , as @entity117 are finding out , are coming under pressure to act '			0
labour leader @entity133 today used a speech at a @entity117 event to criticise the ' extraordinary events ' the firm goes to in order to avoid paying tax in the @entity93			0
tonight mr @entity4 insisted he did discuss the broader issue of tax avoidance with mr @entity116 during the meeting of the @entity143 , but not the particular concerns about @entity117 's tax bill			1
the prime minister said : ' i raised the issue very directly as he is on my business advisory panel and we discussed the @entity38 agenda , the tax multinationals are paying and i made sure there were proper contributions from people around the table , including him , on that issue			2
' aside from talking about it what is much more important is taking action , what putting this at the front of the @entity38 agenda has achieved is a proper agreement , here in the @entity14 to start with , that all countries should exchange tax information , that all countries should act on beneficial ownership , so we know who owns what			0
i think this is a big step forward			0
' he went on : ' i explained my @entity38 agenda , how important i think it is , i explained i think it is important to tackle not just tax evasion but aggressive tax avoidance			1
' i asked @entity116 to comment on that and he did in the meeting			0
i do n’t think we ’re going to solve this if we simply take one company or another company that is registered in @entity8 , this one in @entity94			2
we are going to solve this we are going to have proper concrete action			0
' before traveling to the @entity14 summit , mr @entity4 warned other countries the losses from tax avoidance were ' staggering ' @entity191 , @entity8 commissioner for tax , said countries were on course to agree full automatic exchange of information on income from january 2015			1
reports about global firms cutting their tax bills by taking advantage of differences between national tax systems ' clearly demonstrate that there are weaknesses in our corporate taxation system both at @entity14 level and also internationally ' , he told @entity209			0
a package of measures has been put forward by the @entity212 , including general anti-abuse rules in member states , renegotiation of double - taxation treaties and a blacklist for tax havens			0
@entity94 prime minister @entity219 defended his country 's tax regime from criticism that it is used by firms to cut their tax bills ' this package , if implemented thoroughly by member states will make significant change in this area ' , said mr @entity191			1
earlier @entity94 prime minister @entity219 brushed off attacks on @entity94 's tax regime for helping multinationals avoid billions in tax - insisting he was backing plans for global tax transparency and an end to tax havens			1
@entity94 's low corporate tax rates have been identified in inquiries into how companies such as @entity117 and @entity238 arrange their tax affairs to reduce liabilities to a minimum			1
but , heading into @entity14 summit talks in @entity2 on cracking down on corporate tax avoidance and tax evasion , mr @entity219 insisted : ' i 'd like to repeat that @entity94 's corporation tax rate is statute - based , is very clear , very transparent - we do not do special deals with individual companies in relation to that rate			1
' the @entity253 said @entity94 was one of the first countries to agree a scheme on sharing of tax information with the @entity259			2
' multinationals , in their aggressive tax planning , operate in many jurisdictions , ' he said			0
' for that reason , @entity94 has been very much to the forefront in having and building more international consensus as far as transparency in tax regimes is concerned			2
