' allegations of preventable deaths that may be linked to delays at the @entity23 have triggered an election - year uproar			0
' there is no question that this is a termination of his job there before he was planning to go , ' @entity9 told @entity43 chief @entity1 correspondent @entity41			2
@entity44 , the undersecretary for health care at the @entity46 , resigned abruptly on friday , just a day after telling a @entity48 committee that he knew in 2010 about a memo describing ' inappropriate scheduling practices ' now blamed for as many as 40 deaths at @entity46 medical centers			1
@entity53 dr. @entity44 has resigned just a day after testifying in a contentious @entity48 hearing about a @entity46 health care scandal tied to as many as 40 deaths focus : millions of military veterans depend on @entity46 hospitals and clinics for acute and long - term medical care , and the system has been rife with wait - list problems for years complaints about long wait lists and falsified patient appointment reports have dogged @entity46 hospitals and clinics nationwide			1
@entity44 , a 40 - year veteran of the @entity46 system and its undersecretary for health , tendered his resignation even though he was already scheduled to retire later in the year			1
the @entity1 announced his successor on may 1 but said @entity44 would remain in his job until @entity75 , director of the @entity46 's @entity77 - based @entity76 , wins @entity48 confirmation			1
secretary @entity12 requested and received @entity44 's resignation but has steadfastly insisted upon staying put himself , despite calls from prominent @entity82 and @entity83 for his ouster			1
@entity1 press secretary @entity85 released an approving statement late in the afternoon about the resignation , which was announced just an hour after his final daily press briefing of the week concluded			1
' the president supports secretary @entity12 ’s decision , ' @entity85 said , adding that president @entity2 ' has asked @entity93 to conduct a review of @entity96 practices and procedures at its facilities nationwide to ensure better access to care , and that review is ongoing			2
' ' the president and @entity93 take the allegations around misconduct very seriously , ' he added			0
@entity12 said in a statement that ' most veterans are satisfied with the quality of their @entity46 health care , but we must do more to improve timely access to that care			1
' on thursday , both @entity12 and @entity44 men testified in a @entity113 hearing			2
@entity12 said then that he was ' mad as hell ' about the growing scandal but would n't terminate any underlings until an inspector general report was completed			1
that report 's conclusions are expected in early june			0
@entity44 acknowledged to lawmakers that he had seen a 2010 memo titled ' @entity122 , ' which described failures in several of the @entity46 's 21 service regions			2
@entity12 , seated next to him , insisted that ' i was not , i am not ' aware of it			0
recent revelations blame shoddy management for the deaths of dozens of former soldiers , airmen , sailors and @entity133 , as administrators in @entity135 – and possibly elsewhere – maintained a secret off - the - books waiting list for veterans in need of critical care			1
official lists were kept short so the agency could appear to be doing its job despite some waits being more than a year long			0
in one case , a @entity135 official was awarded bonuses based on fraudulent statistics as veterans died waiting for medical care			1
' we have been working continuously to try and identify where those sites are and what we need to do to prevent that from happening			0
it 's absolutely inexcusable , ' @entity44 told lawmakers thursday			2
' the individuals are ... held accountable , ' he insisted , while admitting that ' i ca n't give you an example specifically			0
' ' but if someone were found to be manipulating inappropriately the scheduling system , they would be disciplined			0
' ' i do n't know whether anybody was specifically disciplined around that issue , ' he later conceded			0
next to go ? @entity44 ( r ) is out , but va secretary gen. @entity12 ( c ) is refusing to resign standing guard : members of the @entity172 have attended hearings and applied pressure throughout the @entity46 scandal , demanding @entity12 's resignation at every turn @entity179 @entity83 sen. @entity178 grilled @entity12 about the allegations of wrongdoing and demanded to know if he would ask the @entity182 to investigae			1
' we have more than allegations at this point , ' @entity178 said thursday			0
' we have evidence , solid evidence , of wrongdoing within the @entity46 system , and it is more than an isolated instance of wrongdoing – it ’s a pattern and practice			0
' @entity12 would say only that he would ' make that [ option ] available to the @entity46 inspector general ' if that ’s his request			1
' @entity13 secretary @entity12 's future is a delicate subject : he 's a decorated veteran , twice wounded in the @entity198 , a former army chief of staff , and a @entity201 - @entity200 who retired as a four - star general in addition to the @entity135 scandal , @entity46 offices have reportedly destroyed more than 1.5 million medical orders in recent years without confirming that patients received the treatment they were supposed to get			1
similar reporting has shown that backlogs of medical appointments in @entity212 and @entity46 facilities were wiped off the books to make appointment backlogs appear far shorter than they were			0
the @entity1 has expressed continued confidence in @entity12 , a wounded warrior who rose to the rank of four - star general before taking on the thankless job of managing the @entity46			1
key to the @entity2 administration 's defense of its leading veteran advocate is the ongoing inspector general investigation			2
but members of @entity225 are still smelling blood and want @entity12 to resign next			0
@entity228 ’ affairs chairman @entity227 , a @entity229 @entity82 , said in a statement friday that ' @entity44 's " resignation " is the pinnacle of disingenuous political doublespeak			2
@entity44 was already scheduled to retire in 2014 and president @entity2 has already announced his intention to nominate @entity44 ’s replacement , so characterizing this as a " resignation " just does n’t pass the smell test			0
' “ desperate to get ahead of a delays in care crisis that is growing by the day , yet apparently unwilling to take substantive actions to hold any of its leaders accountable for negligence that harms veterans , @entity46 has resorted to what it does best : splitting semantic hairs to create the illusion of accountability and progress , ' @entity227 added			2
@entity253 @entity252 sen. @entity252 said thursday that @entity2 ' needs to find a new leader to lead this organization out of the wilderness , and back to providing the service our veterans deserve			0
