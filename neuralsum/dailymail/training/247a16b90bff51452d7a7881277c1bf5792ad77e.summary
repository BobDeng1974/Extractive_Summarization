tax shelter : @entity1 's @entity2 with his wife , @entity3 serial tax avoiders face huge fines and could even be named and shamed			1
the chancellor launched a crackdown yesterday that could raise £ 2.8billion a year from those who take part in schemes designed to cut their tax bills			2
he outlawed a number of tax ruses commonly used by the well - off and the self - employed to disguise their true earnings			1
and the small print in @entity18 documents revealed that the government is to review whether the names of serial tax avoiders should be published as a way of shaming them and deterring others			1
in the past 18 months , a number of celebrities , including comedian @entity26 and @entity1 star @entity2 , have come under fire for using tax avoidance schemes			1
the threat to name and shame serial avoiders comes at a time when @entity34 is being handed more powers to tackle those it believes owe the @entity37			2
it already publishes a ‘ most wanted ’ list with the names and photographs of cheats involved in vat and tax credit fraud			2
it has always been a principle of the tax system that a person ’s affairs are kept private and publicly naming and shaming those who had not been convicted of a crime has been seen as a breach of this			2
however , experts said revealing the names of high - profile figures could help put off others from taking part in tax avoidance schemes			1
@entity59 , tax partner at the accountancy firm @entity61 , said : ‘ people like their tax affairs to remain private , so the threat to have your details made public if you use certain schemes is a major disincentive			2
‘ some of the schemes targeted are quite mainstream , but others are more specifically about tax avoidance			1
‘ what this government is saying is that if you ’re doing something and they think it is deliberately to pay less tax , then they want to stop that			2
’ schemes being outlawed by the chancellor include those where business owners sell their company to another one they own as a ruse to pay less tax			1
he is also cracking down on hedge fund managers who hide their income from fees on some types of shares issued as a way of cutting tax , and on schemes where avoiders take loans as a way of hiding their true income			1
fines are also being increased for people who do not declare avoidance schemes , and there will be a clampdown on those promoting them			1
non-domiciled residents , or non-doms , will have to pay £ 60,000 a year if they have been in the @entity108 for 12 of the past 14 years , and £ 90,000 if they have been here for 17 of the past 20 years			0
this new rule is to combat foreign nationals living in the @entity108 who have found a way round existing guidelines			0
earlier this year , a court ruled that @entity2 , 43 , fellow @entity1 members @entity116 , 46 , and @entity118 , 42 , and their manager @entity119 had attempted to shelter £ 66million in a tax avoidance scheme			1
they could now face paying back £ 20million to @entity34			0
@entity2 has apologised to those ‘ offended by the tax stories ’			1
banks we bailed out will face £ 4bn bill to help the recovery @entity128 said if the regime was allowed to continue some banks would not be paying tax for 20 years @entity108 's scandal - hit banks are facing a shock £ 4billion tax bill , forcing them to ‘ pay their fair share ’ for triggering the financial crisis			1
the chancellor announced a tough new rules on their ability to use losses from previous years to cut tax bills on current profits			0
@entity145 @entity128 said if the regime was allowed to continue some banks would not be paying tax for 15 to 20 years			1
describing this as ‘ totally unacceptable ’ , he added : ‘ the banks got public support in the crisis and they should now support the public in the recovery			0
’ as part of the single biggest revenue - raising measure in the @entity159 , banks will only be able to offset half their profits against past losses			0
currently , they can use previous losses to wipe out their profit and avoid paying corporation tax			0
the @entity18 forecasts that the reform will raise £ 3.5billion over five years and said restrictions on tax relief for losses on bad loans will raise a further £ 350million over the same period			0
mr @entity128 said the move will ensure ‘ our banks pay their fair share ’ and pointed out that corporation tax receipts from the banking sector has plunged from £ 7.3billion in 2006/7 to just £ 1.6billion in 2013/14			1
@entity59 , tax partner at accountant @entity61 , said : ‘ this will hit the banks hard as the wall of losses they stored up in the financial crisis will no longer mean the banks wo n’t be paying tax to fund the economic recovery			0
’ it is thought that bailed - out lenders @entity190 and @entity191 , in which taxpayers still have a considerable stake , will be hardest hit			0
they have racked up billions of pounds in losses , which they have used to cut the amount they pay to the exchequer			0
@entity190 has £ 5billion of so - called deferred tax assets at its disposal			2
@entity191 and @entity204 have a total of £ 2.4billion , while @entity206 has £ 500million			0
the tougher rules will not apply to new banks that incur losses in their first few years , because the government does not want to restrict challenger banks set up to take on the @entity213 giants			0
the @entity18 admitted that uncertainty over the amount of tax the change will raise from the banks is ‘ very high ’ , because it is difficult to predict how much profit they will make .			0
