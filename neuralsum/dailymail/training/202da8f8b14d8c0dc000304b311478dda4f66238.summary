sore , watery , uncomfortable eyes can be hugely debilitating			1
one of the most common causes is dry eye syndrome – which affects nearly five million @entity3 over the age of 45 and , despite its name , actually leads to more tears			1
the condition can be triggered by everything from the weather to hormonal changes , and also can be a symptom of an underlying health problem			1
here the experts reveal what could be causing your eye trouble – and explain the ways to tackle it ... hopeless : sore and watery eyes can be an indication of dry eye syndrome tears matter when the eyes are n’t producing enough tears , or the tears evaporate too quickly , we are said to be suffering dry eye syndrome			1
symptoms include sore , irritated eyes , blurred vision , the feeling of having something in your eye and the eyes becoming very watery			1
they can also become red , but not always			0
about 20 per cent of people in the @entity3 suffer from dry eye syndrome , rising to 50 per cent in those over 65			1
@entity41 , an optometrist and trustee of @entity43 , explains : ‘ as we get older the constitution of tears is just not quite as strong so the eyes become dry			1
’ hormonal changes associated with ageing can also take their toll on the quality of our tears , she says			0
‘ some women find that when they hit the menopause they can no longer tolerate contact lenses			0
the same thing can happen when they take the pill or become pregnant			0
’ surprisingly , sufferers of dry eye syndrome often find their eyes look watery , says @entity62 - based optometrist @entity61			1
‘ the eye is dry and so it overproduces tears , but it does n’t help because the tears do n’t contain the right lubricants			1
’ eye drops can help , and in the case of menopausal women , supplements such as evening primrose oil too			1
blink and you 'll miss it : screen time , be it tablets , computers or televisions , can result in forgetting to blink - drying out your eyes are you a bad blinker ? regular blinking is crucial for healthy eyes , says @entity41			1
‘ every time you blink , you ’re keeping your eyes refreshed and clearing the cornea , the transparent front part of the eye			1
’ the problem is that when we ’re concentrating on something , particularly a screen , we tend to forget to blink – meaning the eyes become dry			1
studies have shown that on average , we blink about 22 times a minute , but when we concentrate on a computer screen or smartphone , or even while driving , the rate goes down to between five and seven blinks per minute			0
many people also get into bad blinking habits , says @entity41			2
‘ it ’s a reflex action – but a good way to make sure your eyes stay fully lubricated is to blink slowly and deliberately every so often			2
‘ one way to check you ’re doing it correctly is to hold the tips of your index fingers on the outer corners of the eyelids			0
you ’ll notice that when you blink normally , your fingers will be pulled in			0
if you do it slowly and carefully – as if you are going to sleep – your fingers wo n’t move as much			0
it might feel quite unnatural at first			0
’ a study published in the journal @entity117 found that reading from a smartphone can cause eye strain because the eyes have to point in the right direction as well as focus on the small text , meaning they have to work harder			1
unnecessary : ' eye brightening drops ' are mostly a waste of time and could even give you allergies when using a computer , smartphone or tablet for long periods , remember the 20 - 20 - 20 rule : every 20 minutes , look up for 20 seconds at something at least 20ft away			2
or here ’s a tip from @entity137 , consultant ophthalmologist at @entity138 : ‘ @entity140 as a “ blink ’ ’ key			0
every time you hit it , remember to blink			0
’ @entity144 is the worst season for dry eyes cold weather wo n’t worsen dry eyes – it ’s turning on the central heating that causes the problem , says @entity61			1
‘ central heating can make the atmosphere very dry so your eyes might feel worse			1
’ and if you ’ve ever wondered why your eyes water during a winter walk , it ’s because the wind has dried them out , she says			2
‘ it ’s that reflex action again			0
the eyes are overproducing tears because they ’re so dry			1
’ a night on the @entity163 as if a hangover was n’t bad enough , excessive drinking can cause sore eyes because of its dehydrating effect on the body , says @entity169 , from the @entity170			2
and for women , if you do have a late night , do n’t forget to take off your eye make - up			2
‘ if you leave it on , it can cause and aggravate blepharitis , a common condition where the rims of the eyelid become red , swollen and itchy and the eyelashes crusty			0
everyone should also make sure they give the area around the eyes a good wash when washing their face to prevent the condition			2
’ @entity189 can be caused by a bacterial infection , or it can be a complication of a skin condition such as seborrhoeic dermatitis			0
‘ if the symptoms persist , you should see an optometrist , ’ says @entity169			0
do n’t waste time on eye - @entity199 drops there are myriad eye drops for dry eyes , but always choose a preservative - free product , says @entity61			1
the preservatives can , over time , cause you to develop an allergy and make dry eye syndrome worse			1
if a product is preservative - free , it should be stated on the pack			0
some people can find it difficult to put in eye drops			2
however , there are products that can be sprayed on to a closed eye , allowing the drops to be absorbed through the margins of the eye			2
‘ experts are divided as to whether or not they work , but a lot of my patients – especially those with shaky hands – find they are better than nothing , ’ says @entity61			0
if you do use eye drops , make sure you use them at least four to six times a day , she adds			2
‘ eye drops usually give instant relief but usually folk do n’t use them often enough , so they do n’t think they work			2
and they should be seen as a long - term treatment			0
’ speak to your pharmacist in the first instance , but if eye problem persists for more than two weeks , it might be worth visiting your gp			0
and do n’t bother with drops that promise to brighten the eyes , @entity61 says			0
‘ these contain ingredients that work by constricting the blood vessels , making them look less red			0
but they wo n’t give any relief against dry eyes			1
