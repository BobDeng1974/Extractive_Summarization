with a 354 - foot replica of the @entity5 at the centre , the vegetable gardens in the @entity2 town of @entity3 may be the world 's most elaborate allotment			1
where greens and radishes grow were supposed to be the beautifully manicured gardens of a development built to be just like @entity14			1
but those plans were abandoned when developers ran out of money and the garden became overgrown and unsightly			0
@entity3 , in the city of @entity41 in the east @entity2 province of @entity43 , opened with great fanfare in 2007 with @entity14 - style houses and its own @entity46			1
its one - third scale @entity5 ( the real one is 1,063 feet ) looks remarkably realistic , but was n't enough to entice the 10,000 residents developers hoped for			2
just 2,000 moved in and local media refer to it as a ghost town			2
with the tower starting to rust and a lift to the top never coming to fruition , the few residents who remain are largely happy about the vegetable plots saying they are more appealing than weeds			0
@entity3 opened with great fanfare in 2007 but fell substantially short of their 10,000 resident target developers ran out of money and have failed the complete the project , which is now largely farmland and abandoned residential towers the developers blame @entity3 's location for its failure			1
copycat towns are no new concept in @entity2 , with @entity72 city of @entity73 recreated in the port city of @entity75 in @entity2 's north - eastern @entity77 province			0
the @entity80 - listed @entity79 village of @entity81 has also been mimicked in @entity83 province , much to the disapproval of those from the original .			0

@entity3 was built to *resemble* @entity14 with its own 354 - foot @entity5
the town opened amid great fanfare in 2007 but is now a ghost town
overgrown gardens were *overtaken* by locals to grown vegetable
