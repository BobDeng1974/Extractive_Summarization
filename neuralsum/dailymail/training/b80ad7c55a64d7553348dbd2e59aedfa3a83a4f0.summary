an @entity1 woman has told in graphic detail of the moment she was allegedly sexually assaulted twice during a @entity5 flight by a chief steward whilst he was on duty			1
@entity8 was flying from @entity9 to @entity10 on august 4 when her alleged attacker @entity11 put his hands under a blanket and into her pants			1
but this is a claim which the 54 - year - old has denied as he told police that ms @entity8 did not resist him			1
it was three hours into flight @entity19 when the 26 - year - old 's nightmare began			1
she claimed @entity31 touched her upper thigh before putting his hands under her clothing , using the excuse that he was ' comforting her '			2
she insisted he touched her genitals and then digitally raped her			0
' i just keep saying " why did n't i scream , why did n't i shout ? ' she said			2
' i am a strong person because i can do that , i know i can			0
but when i was in the moment , i could n't			2
i felt so scared and petrified			0
' at the time ms @entity47 , who was flying to @entity10 to join her boyfriend , was curled up at the back of the plane in row 81 , with her head against the window and empty seats beside her			1
it was then that @entity31 sat on the aisle seat and told her , in answer to her question , that it would be another nine hours before the plane touched down in @entity10			1
but something about his behaviour caused her concern			0
the victim was seated at the back of the plane when the alleged sexual assaults occurred ' he grabbed my hand and told me to lie down and relax , ' she said			2
' i asked him to get me something to drink			0
i wanted to get him away from me			0
i did n’t feel comfortable			0
' he came back and then he moved my legs and put them on his lap. i felt shocked , i did n't know what to do			2
i did n’t know what to say			0
and then he started rubbing my legs			0
' after @entity31 walked away , ms @entity8 managed to confide in one of the closest seated passengers - @entity78 national @entity77 - in row 88			1
' i saw her face full of tears , ' she told sunday night			2
' she literally told me , " this man put his hands in my pants "			2
' it was ms @entity77 who urged the distraught ms @entity8 to report the incident to police			1
although ms @entity8 did n't say anything to @entity31 , when asked if she made it clear to him that what he was doing was wrong she replied that he ' started moving his hands down , moving his hands down towards my belly button and i pushed his hands away and he started to massage my legs '			1
' i thought by pushing it away that i was telling him that i did n't want it to happen , ' she said			2
as the assault was continuing , she managed to record the incident under a blanket , as well as filming video on her phone of an altercation she had with @entity31 after the incident			2
she says in the phone recording : ' he 's massaging my legs , i 'm so scared i just want to get off this plane			0
' @entity31 , she said , walked away but half an hour later he came back to the same seat and once again moved her outstretched legs onto his legs			0
ms @entity8 managed to confide in one of the closest seated passengers - @entity78 national @entity77 ' i could feel that he has got an erection and he is rubbing himself up against me , ' she said			1
' he put his hands inside my pants … he put his fingers inside me			0
' that 's rape , ’ the tv interviewer tells her			0
' yes , ' she agreed through her tears			0
asked if she had tried to stop him , she replied : ' no. ' ' as soon as it happened he got up and i think the thought process of what he had done … he realised what he had done … it had happened so fast that i was absolutely frozen , ' she said			0
the 54 - year - old begged for ms @entity8 's forgiveness and asked her not to report the incidents @entity31 , a married man and a father of three , joined @entity5 in 1980			1
after the assault , ms @entity8 made a handwritten complaint to other cabin crew members , detailing what had happened			1
ms @entity8 was moved to a first class seat and at one point the captain came to speak to her			1
but neither he nor his team stopped the chief steward from approaching her yet again			1
' i asked for him to be taken away , i did n’t want him anywhere near me , ' she said			0
yet her requested was not heeded			0
a video recording , made on ms @entity8 's phone , showed @entity31 sitting in a seat on the other side of the aisle , shaking his head , putting his hands to his face , or looking down at the floor as she accused him of putting his hand inside her pants			1
then she can be heard saying to the steward : ' i do n't want to see you , go away you give me the creeps , you dirty old man			2
' ' how could you do it ? ' she is heard asking him through her cries of despair			0
' i am so scared			0
i want to get off this plane			0
' during this confrontation , @entity31 can be seen begging for ms @entity8 's forgiveness asking her to give him ' a second chance '			1
@entity31 is then heard saying : ' i am so sorry			0
i am so sorry ma'am			0
' the steward is currently detained by @entity167 police and is expected to face trial in @entity167 in six or seven months time @entity5 has responded with a public statement but has not contacted ms @entity8 or offered an apology , any counseling or compensation at @entity10 airport , @entity31 was taken away for questioning and she was taken for a physical examination and a dna swab			1
however an airline official in @entity10 told her that if she filed a report that was not true she could get into serious trouble			2
despite the warning , ms @entity8 went ahead and informed @entity167 police			1
after 14 hours of questioning , she was required to confront @entity183 one last time			2
when she accused him of raping her , @entity31 told police that was not his intentions			1
' he said that he never intended to do that and he said that i did n't resist him , ' she said			1
@entity5 has responded with a public statement that confirmed the allegations			0
but they failed to offer an apology , any counseling or compensation to ms @entity8			1
