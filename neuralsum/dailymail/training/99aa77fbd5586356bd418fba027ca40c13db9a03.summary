by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 11:53 est , 30 january 2014 buried more than 100ft below the ground , it is an unlikely place to grow crops			1
but two entrepreneurs have set up a subterranean garden in former @entity8 air raid shelters in south @entity9			1
the 2.5 - acre ' farm ' , created by @entity11 and @entity12 , sits in dark , confined tunnels under the @entity14 , near @entity15			1
mr @entity11 and mr @entity12 have spent the past 18 months conducting trials in the tunnels - with the first produce expected to start growing in march			1
the crops - sold under the brand name ' growing underground ' - are expected to hit restaurants , supermarkets and wholesalers later this year			1
they will include a range of exotic herbs and shoots , including pea shoots , rocket , red amaranth ( a leafy vegetable and grain ) , mizuna , broccoli , garlic chives , red vein sorrel , mustard leaf , radish , coriander and @entity73 basil			1
team : mr @entity11 ( left ) and mr @entity12 ( right ) have joined forces with acclaimed chef @entity76 ( centre ) harvesting produce : the enterpeneurs have spent the past 18 months conducting trials in the historic tunnels crops : the produce is expected to be sold to restaurants , supermarkets and wholesalers later this year packaged : it will include a range of herbs , including watercress ( left ) , pea shoots and red amaranth ( right ) meanwhile , edible flowers and miniature vegetables will also be grown in the ' farm ' - with plans to move onto heritage tomato varieties and mushrooms			1
mr @entity11 and mr @entity12 have joined forces with @entity99 - starred chef @entity76 , who has joined the company as a director			1
he will advise the pair on crop selection , product design and partnerships			0
plants and herbs need two things to grow - light and soil			2
underground tunnels have neither , but both can be substituted for led lights and a hydroponic system			2
led lights provide plants with the wavelengths of light they need for photosynthesis - essential for growth			0
modern led systems can allow plants to grow perfectly normally without the need for real sunlight			2
hydroponics technology allows plants to be grown without soil			0
it works by dissolving the nutrients that a plant would normally get from soil into water			0
the roots of a plant or herb can then be suspended , flooded , or even misted with the nutrient - rich solution , allowing it to grow successfully			0
mr @entity76 , who runs the acclaimed @entity136 restaurant , said : ' when i first met these guys i thought they were absolutely crazy			2
' but when i visited the tunnels and sampled the delicious produce they are already growing down there i was blown away			0
the market for this produce is huge			0
' in order to successfully grow the crops , the temperature in the tunnels is kept at 16 degrees celsius , while produce is grown in specially - designed three - layered platforms			1
meanwhile , special filters are used to keep the air in the tunnels free of pests , eliminating the need for pesticides			2
the underground caverns are part of the @entity15 tunnels - under @entity15 tube station - which were completed in 1942 and opened to the public in july 1944			1
equipped with bunks , medical posts , kitchens and sanitation , they were constructed to accommodate up to 8,000 people			0
however , more than 12,000 people swarmed into the tunnels during a bombing raid on july 24 , 1944			2
mr @entity11 and mr @entity12 hope the new crop ' farm ' will help the country to achieve a carbon - free economy and successfully deal with the pressures of urban population growth			1
the tunnels will be carbon neutral , with any energy needs coming from green suppliers - while food miles will also be kept to a minimum thanks to the central @entity9 location			1
tube : the tunnels sit more than 100ft below @entity15 tube station ( pictured ) in south - east @entity9 ready to sell : exotic herbs , such as @entity187 ( above ) , will be among the crops grown in the air raid shelters fresh : vegetables such as broccoli ( left ) and red sorrel , peashoots and radish ( right ) will also be grown the entrepreneurs have now started fundraising to accelerate the development of the business			1
' @entity199 and i are thrilled to be close to getting @entity201 under way			0
we 've been experimenting for months , ' said mr @entity11			2
' now that we 've secured the site we 're kicking off a crowd - funding campaign today			0
we have a detailed business plan and we 've already had lots of interest from private investors			0
' we 're confident that investors of all sizes will see a significant return on their investment			0
hopeful : mr @entity11 ( left ) and mr @entity12 ( right ) are fundraising to accelerate the development of the business			1
' integrating farming into the urban environment makes a huge amount of sense and we 're delighted that we 're going to make it a reality			0
' he added that @entity224 , an expert horticulturalist used to growing crops in some of the harshest conditions on the planet , will be acting as the company 's advisor			0
' there is no ' could ' , ' might ' or ' maybe ' about our underground farm , ' he said			0
' we will be up and running and will be supplying produce later this year			2
' investors are invited to buy a stake in @entity201 from Â £ 10 , while Â £ 25,000 will enable them to have voting rights			0
the duo are aiming to raise Â £ 1million from their crowdfunding drive and hope to employ up to 15 staff at the south @entity9 site .			1
