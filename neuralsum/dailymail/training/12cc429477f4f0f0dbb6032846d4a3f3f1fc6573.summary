by @entity0 the @entity2 licence fee is ‘ too high ’ and should be decriminalised , its former chairman has admitted			1
@entity4 , who left the corporation in 2006 to lead @entity6 , said he feels ‘ squeamish ’ about the fact viewers can be sent to prison for not paying the £ 145.50 charge			2
and although he said he supports the principle of charging all households to watch live tv , he called for it to be reduced when it is comes up for renewal in 2016			0
former @entity2 chairman @entity4 believes non-payment of the licence fee should be decriminalised @entity18 told a @entity20 debate : ‘ i support the licence fee , but i think it is too high			1
that is a whole other debate , but nevertheless i fully support the licence fee for the next charter period			1
’ he added : ‘ i think the big debate is going to be about the issues of criminality , compulsion and so on			0
i think we all feel a bit squeamish about the fact you can go to prison if you do n’t pay the fine for not paying the licence fee			2
‘ if there is a way to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee , that would be a good thing			1
’ @entity18 first joined the @entity2 as controller of @entity43 in 1984 , and became its director of pro-gramming in 1986			2
during his time in charge of tv output , he courted controversy by cancelling production of @entity50 , which he branded ‘ awful ’ and ‘ outdated ’			0
@entity18 said the @entity2 must still be allowed to impose penalties on those who fail to pay the licence fee , otherwise it would open the doors to pre-determined programming after a stint at @entity57 , he became @entity2 chairman for two years and now sits as a @entity60 peer in the @entity61			1
although he called for licence fee evasion to be decriminalised , @entity18 said the @entity2 must still be allowed to impose penalties on those who fail to pay			1
he said : ‘ you have to retain compulsion , otherwise you are opening the way for subscription			0
subscription means pre-determined , well - known programming that will be guaranteed to drive subscription			2
you wo n’t get @entity71			0
you will be getting whatever they can pick up in the free - market in competition with @entity75			0
’ the government is currently conducting a year - long review into whether to decriminalise the licence fee @entity18 added : ‘ if you were inventing the @entity79 today i think there are three institutions you would n’t create in a modern world			1
i do n’t think you would create a hereditary monarchy , i do n’t think you would create an unelected second chamber , and i do n’t think you would create an organisation like the @entity2 and organise for it to have £ 4billion of public funding in an age of media plenty , expansion and so on			0
‘ but you have to believe that there is something in these three institutions that connects with the @entity79 public , and the @entity2 is one of those institutions that relies for its existence not on political whim , not on political dogma , but on the affection and support of the @entity79 public			0
‘ it faces an incredibly difficult few years coming up , not least with the whole argument about how it should be funded			0
’ the government is currently conducting a year - long review into whether to decriminalise the licence fee			1
it followed a campaign by backbench mps to scrap the threat of prison sentences for fee evaders			2
in 2012 , 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying their tv licence , accounting for one in nine of all magistrates court cases			1
most of those found guilty were landed with penalties of up to £ 1,000 and a criminal record , and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines .			0
