jailed : @entity2 's home - made ied bombs and detonators were found in two garages he rented in @entity5 , @entity6 a ' crank ' who triggered a terrorist alert when he made explosives to scare off burglars has been jailed today			1
six hundred people had to be evacuated when @entity2 ’s homemade @entity14 bombs and detonators were found in two garages he rented in @entity5 , @entity6			1
@entity2 , 52 , had alarmed neighbours by uploading a video showing an explosion in a residential street , in the film is seen describing it as his ' application for joining @entity21 '			1
the electrical engineer had told @entity23 the explosives were the cheapest way he could find of making burglar deterrents at a time when he was £ 10,000 in debt and could not afford an alarm			0
his ieds were discovered because he had tried to make himself a fake @entity32 identity card and he was interrogated for six days by anti-terrorist police after his arrest			1
he had created the mini bombs with @entity37 ( tri-acetone tri-peroxide ) , the same substance that was used in the @entity41 bombings of july 7 2005 , said prosecutor @entity42			2
jailing @entity2 , who once ran his own burglar alarm company , judge @entity43 told him he was satisfied he had no connection with terrorism or political organisations			1
the judge said he also accepted that @entity2 , an alcoholic with cirrhosis of the liver , was lonely and depressed after his wife left him and his business collapsed in 2010			1
' as you became more isolated from society you became what the @entity55 described as a crank			0
you had an obsessive fear of burglars , ' said the judge			2
' i am quite satisfied you gave a truthful account when you said you created these explosives to deter burglars			0
' i am also satisfied you created them with the intention of scaring rather than injuring			0
' the judge said he also believed @entity2 ’s explanation for trying to make himself an @entity32 card - that he thought it would help him get treatment from a psychotherapist more quickly			1
' but these were small quantities of volatile , sensitive and very dangerous material , ' he said			0
he said : ' you chose to make explosives because you were bored and you were fascinated by the whole process and i suspect regarded it as something of a challenge			2
' your actions particularly in the present climate disturbed and frightened residents			0
' your actions undermined their confidence causing them in some cases to be really frightened and anxious and some remain so even to this day , as witnessed by the fact that 200 people attended a public meeting arranged by the police			1
that gives you some idea of the scale of fear you caused			0
' the thought of you , an alcoholic , working in your grubby garage creating dangerous explosives is very disturbing indeed			0
' @entity2 had pleaded guilty to a charge that between september 1 , 2011 and may 12 , 2012 he had made @entity37 ' in circumstances to give rise to suspicion that he was not making it for a lawful object			1
' mrs @entity42 had told the court ' when @entity6 constabulary received a tip off from the @entity121 that a man in @entity6 was seeking to create a fake identity card for @entity32 they had little idea what they were to find			1
' the man in question , mr @entity2 , had been buying various items on @entity130 that indicated he might be making explosive devices			1
' not only that , but he was definitely not an @entity32 employee			1
when police searched @entity2 's house on may 11 this year they found various items including a quantity of detonators			1
' hoax ' : a clip from the video showing an apparent explosion in a residential street mrs @entity144 added : ' his internet browsing history showed numerous searches dating from august 2011 on how to make small bombs and and where to buy the ingredients			1
' the police also discovered he had access to two garages in @entity156 close in @entity5			1
' in the first to be searched were four fully functional imporoved explosive devices which were tested in controlled explosions and which exploded with no difficulty			0
' the debris contained a substance called @entity37 which @entity2 had mananged to manufacture			1
this is a very sensitive high explosive which can be detonated by static , spark , flame , impact or friction			0
it is not used commercially because its storage qualities are poor and it is too sensitive for safe use			0
' it is worth noting that this compound was used in the @entity41 tube bombings on 7 july 2005			0
' also at the garage was a selection of chemicals and various detonators , presumably for use in making further ieds			0
' there was also what appeared to be a home made rocket launcher but which mr @entity184 described as a potato gun			2
' another detonator was found in the other garage nearby , she said			0
@entity2 was interviewed for several days by @entity191 officers at @entity193 police syation and told them he had made about ten of the devices and had tested five of them in his back garden , said mrs @entity42			1
' he said he had done this in order to create booby traps for burglars after being frightened that someone had got into his house when his dogs started barking in the night			2
' the police have no record of any report of bugrlary at his address			2
there was also no security at the house - as mr @entity2 himself put it , the back door was totally insecure , the house had no insurance because he could not afford to pay for it and the front door was also inadequately secured			2
a fence panel in the back garden was also missing			0
blast : the man can be seen sprawling on the pavement after the package was supposedly detonated ' there was an alarm box on the house but it was not connected even though @entity2 had previously had his own alarm company			2
he said it was because he had not got around to it because he was so depressed			2
' he insisted that none of the devices would have caused injury - just a loud bang which would have been enough to frighten any burglar away			0
' @entity2 also told police that he wanted the @entity32 card to help him get an appointment with a psychothersapist			1
and he said his alcoholic cirrhosis meant he had only a couple of years to live			0
the area around the garages had to be evacuated in a radius of 200 metres and six hundred people , including residents of a care home , had to get out of their homes , she added			1
the incident had caused such great concern that police held a public meeting to explain the situation to residents			2
' there has been heightened tension between the local communities and efforts are continuing to bring this back to normal levels , ' added mrs @entity42			0
she said the devices could cause the loss of one or more fingers if they went off in someone ’s hand			0
they would cause superficial injujries if they exploded very close to a person			0
@entity271 , defending , pointed out that @entity2 is a man of previous good character but now ‘ lonely after a catalogue of personal problems			1
’ the six days of intense interrogation he had received as a suspected terrorist had ‘ turned his world upside down , ’ mr @entity271 said			0

when police discovered bombs in @entity2 's home *600* people had to be evacuated
judge said accepted that @entity2 was lonely and depressed after his wife left him and his business collapsed in 2010
he had been trying to create a fake identity card for @entity32
