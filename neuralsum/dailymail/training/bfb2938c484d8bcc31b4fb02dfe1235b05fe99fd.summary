@entity0 , the sunday specialist , will have to pass @entity1 to win the @entity3 @entity2 after the @entity4 drove the fastest lap ever at @entity6 to take pole position			1
@entity1 was fastest all weekend – in three practice sessions and the first two periods of qualifying			1
and , when it counted , he pipped @entity0 by three hundredths of a second with a nerveless final act in cloudy @entity15			1
his time of 1min 10.023sec eclipsed the previous lap best set here by @entity20 of 1min 10.646sec for @entity21 in 2006			1
@entity1 ( centre ) celebrates his qualifying win next to @entity0 ( right ) and @entity24 ( left ) @entity25 driver @entity0 ( right ) and team - mate @entity1 ( left ) wave after saturday 's qualifying session @entity0 will have to pass @entity1 to win the @entity3 @entity2 after the @entity4 set the fastest lap ever @entity1 was fastest all weekend – in three practice sessions and the first two periods of qualifying 1			1
@entity39 1:11.099 - - - - - - - - - - 11			2
@entity42 - @entity21 1:12.099 14			2
@entity44 @entity43 - - - - - - - - - - 15			2
pastor @entity48 1:12.233 - - - - - - - - - - @entity1 has now taken 10 pole positions to @entity0 ’s seven , a remarkable record given that no previous team - mate has outperformed @entity0 , the acknowledged one - lap specialist , in qualifying over a season			1
‘ @entity57 job if only it were tomorrow , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i am in the best place but i have to make it count , which i did n’t do last time in @entity61			2
i did n’t find my rhythm there but i am confident i can put that right			0
’ yes , it is during races that @entity0 has proved the superior performer , having won 10 grands prix to @entity1 ’s four			1
that gives the @entity69 a 24 - point lead going into the penultimate round			1
yet double scoring in @entity73 in a fortnight leaves his title hopes vulnerable to a decisive mistake or a calamitous engine failure			2
back to saturday 's showing in @entity3 , @entity0 explained that he lost a bit of time at turns one and 10 on his final flying lap , but said : ‘ it is a long race and there should be two or three stops			1
there are opportunities throughout , not just at the start			2
‘ the @entity3 race means more to me than any other one			2
it is a race i nearly won in 2012 but i got taken out			0
i remember watching @entity93 ( @entity92 ) race on this track when i was younger , and that makes it special			0
’ a random factor in this capricious climate is the ever - present danger of rain , and that could yet play havoc with the otherwise unassailable @entity25 of @entity103 and @entity1			1
@entity0 made two errors on his final run at turns one and 10 and finished three hundredths adrift of @entity1 @entity0 is 24 points ahead of @entity1 with two races remaining , but has never tasted victory in @entity3 someone who knows all about the local weather is @entity24 , who was supported warmly en route to an impressive third fastest for @entity30			1
every time he tore along the pit straight , his countrymen got to their feet , waved their hands in the air and let out a cheer that carried across the track to the media centre over the garages			0
@entity33 , who is due to leave @entity32 at the end of the season to make way for @entity37 , beat his team - mate @entity36 and will start fifth , two places ahead of the @entity127			1
away from @entity15 , @entity128 are trying to raise enough money to compete in @entity73			0
they have launched a ‘ crowdfunding ’ scheme by which supporters are urged to contribute a minimum of £ 10 in exchange for bits of old car			0
@entity137 is unimpressed that @entity128 are trying to raise money to compete in @entity73 @entity1 has now taken 10 pole positions to @entity25 team - mate @entity0 ’s seven this season so far the team , who are administration with debts of £ 16million , have raised £ 500,000 towards a target of £ 2.35million			1
their deadline is next friday and the clock is ticking loudly			0
but @entity148 ’s puppeteer @entity137 is unimpressed by the project			0
‘ i think it ’s a disaster , ’ he said			0
‘ we do n’t want begging bowls			0
if people ca n’t afford to be in @entity148 , they have to find something else to do			0
‘ if i sit in a poker game and i ca n’t afford to be there with the other people , i get killed and have to leave			0
‘ we give the teams nearly $ 900million ( £ 561m ) a year			0
we do n’t spend it			0
‘ when i had a race team a few years ago , in fact a few hundred years ago , i used to run it according to how much money we could spend and we won the world championship			1
‘ that ’s what they do n’t do			0
they do n’t seem to understand that somebody is going to be last			0
’ that someone in qualifying was pastor @entity172			0
there were no surprises in the eight who fell out of the reckoning with him , leaving the 10 leading lights in the shootout for pole			2
and , as is his consistent habit , @entity1 shone brightest at the sharp end of saturday afternoon , at a record average speed of 138.45mph			2
@entity30 driver @entity24 , of @entity3 , came third in qualifying behind @entity1 and @entity0 on saturday @entity1 shone brightest at the sharp end of saturday afternoon ahead of @entity0 and @entity24 ( pictured )			1

@entity1 will start from pole after posting the fastest ever lap at @entity6
the @entity4 was three hundredths of a second quicker than rival @entity0
@entity1 has now taken 10 pole positions to @entity0 ’s seven this season
