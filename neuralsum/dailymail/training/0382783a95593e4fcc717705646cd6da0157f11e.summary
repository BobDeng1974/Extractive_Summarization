sent to clear up some unwanted graffiti , this workerman could n't have imagined he would be the inspiration for the next work on the very same wall			1
but this is the moment an artist decided to turn an image of the man sent to remove his artwork into art. stencil artist - who is known only as ‘ @entity12 ’ - created his first piece ‘ @entity14 ’ on a wall in @entity16 as an amusing comment on the ‘ squeaky clean image ’ of the @entity20 character			1
@entity12 , who is 28 , and from @entity16 , created his artwork in may but eight hours later he was surprised to see someone already in the process of removing it			2
clear up : the unnamed workerman started removing the graffiti - unaware he has become a model for the next artwork to appear on the same wall deciding to document the act of erasing his work , @entity12 took photos of the moment and then used one to show the man that removed it			1
amazingly the artwork featuring the mystery man has not been removed and is still on the wall in @entity41 , @entity42 , today			1
@entity12 said : ' i did the first piece ‘ @entity14 ’ late last year with the second may this year			0
' the first piece is n’t my style but i have a bit of a dislike of @entity49 squeaky clean image so i wanted to use her and @entity52			2
centre of attention : a stenciled representation of the workerman , pictured removing the @entity20 work , left , is now featured on the same wall , right , which he was sent to clean up exhibition : the new work is becoming a local fixture having been left on the wall of the shop on @entity41 , @entity42 ' my reaction to it being removed was a little different than normally			1
knowing a piece as been removed or painted over does n’t bother me , it ’s the name of the game in graffiti but this time was a little different as it only lasted eight hours			1
in action : stencil artist - who is known only as @entity12 - decided to make the removal of his first piece of graffiti the basis for his second work ' so you can imagine my frustration when coming back i found the council ( or private company i ’m not sure ) starting the process of erasing it from the wall - which i documented			1
' looking through the images i took i saw a great one of the removals man so i wanted to put him up in the same space			0
' having known they were mighty quick to respond to graffiti there i was up early the next day in hope to get a photo of him , removing a stencil of him , removing a stencil			0
' i thought it would rip a hole in the space - time continuum or something			0
he came when i was across the road having breakfast , after a while and having his photo taken next to it lots of times he left it			0
' @entity12 said it was a strange time for street art at the moment			0
he said : ' @entity117 does a piece and it gets protected by the council with perspex and another piece from a just as edgy artist with better technical skills gets taken down			0
' i do n’t think the council should decide on the legitimacy or worthiness of a piece but rather let graffiti run it ’s natural course even if that means great art being painted over - another one will takes its place			0
@entity134 said it was not aware of the graffiti and that it was not one of their employees who had removed the work from the wall			2
a spokesman said : ' there are three reasons we would clean off graffiti : if it is offensive , if it is on council property , or if it is on private property and the owner wants it removed			2
