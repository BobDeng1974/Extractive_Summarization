some of @entity1 ’s most popular tv game shows could be forced off the air after regulators launched a probe into whether they constitute gambling			1
producers of @entity7 ’ hugely successful @entity8 on @entity9 have been shocked to be told by the @entity10 that their £ 250,000 jackpot games could be breaking the law because they do not involve any element of skill			1
@entity19 ’s @entity18 ? , the £ 1 million a-night game show presented by @entity16 , and developed by @entity17 , is also understood to have been hit by the investigation			1
producers of @entity7 ' hugely successful @entity8 on @entity9 have been shocked to be told by the @entity10 that their £ 250,000 jackpot games could be breaking the law meanwhile @entity19 plans to revive @entity23 ’s perennial hit @entity24 have also been put on ice pending the outcome of the probe			1
it is against the law to run non-skill games for money without a gambling licence – raising the extraordinary prospect of producers being jailed if they defy the warning			1
last night , one legal expert said that in order to comply with a licence , @entity8 could be forced to move to a time slot after the 9pm watershed , it could also face tight restrictions on the type of advertising allowed to be sold in the commercial breaks and the amount of pre-broadcast publicity it could receive			1
@entity19 plans to revive @entity23 's perennial hit @entity24 have also been put on ice pending the outcome of the probe @entity9 may then decide it would be simpler to cancel the show , than be constrained by so many restrictions			1
the programme , which has been presented by @entity54 since it was first broadcast in 2005 , regularly attracts an audience of more than four million in its afternoon slot			2
viewers watch as contestants guess which of 22 identical sealed boxes contains the show ’s elusive jackpot in what programme makers @entity64 say is a contest of ‘ instinct , gut feeling and luck ’			2
as boxes are opened , contestants decide whether to accept a cash offer from the mysterious banker , or play on in the hope of increasing the offer , while running the risk of receiving a much lower prize			0
however , a @entity78 source told @entity79 : ‘ the @entity10 does not seem to think that there is any skill element to the show			1
‘ even though at the beginning of the show , contestants do not have to stake any of their own money , the argument is that once they ’ve picked a box , which could contain a lot of cash , in subsequent rounds they are in effect gambling with their own money , ’ separately , the @entity10 is also understood to have raised issues over @entity18 ? , where contestants win £ 1 million on the spin of a wheel			1
the @entity10 has told the programme makers that the participants need to show more skill in winning the top prize to escape the need for a gaming licence – which would mean the end of the crucial roulette wheel			1
regulators are also said to be concerned about the way the show ‘ glamorises ’ gambling			1
@entity19 's @entity18 ? , the £ 1 million a-night game show presented by @entity16 , and developed by @entity17 , is also understood to have been hit by the investigation the @entity79 also understands that @entity19 is shelving plans to bring back the popular @entity113 quiz show @entity24 , in which prizes are determined on the turn of a card , for the same reason			1
last night the move was met with bewilderment among game show bosses , who argue that rules created to control casinos and illegal betting should not be applied to entertainment programmes			1
@entity19 's @entity18 ? was developed by @entity17 one senior broadcasting source , who has been fighting the probe behind the scenes , said : ‘ this is an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs			1
‘ the @entity10 has no right to be poking its nose into what are harmless television programmes			0
' how can anyone regard @entity8 as gambling ? ' it is probably the most innocent show on television			1
i think its very telling that this programme is aired in 30 different countries but only in @entity1 has this become an issue			0
‘ you also have to look it from the point of broadcaster			0
they are already heavily regulated by @entity149			0
why on earth would they want to also come under the control of the @entity10 as well ? ' that means they would be answerable to two different regulators who would be looking into its affairs			0
the people who make @entity8 want to operate as a television production company not a casino			0
’ @entity17 ’s spokesman , @entity161 , said : ‘ @entity17 wants to come up with the most exciting combination he can which remains within the rules			0
his view is that it is a light entertainment programme with a gambling element – not what the @entity10 is claiming			2
’ as well as restrictions on scheduling , advertising and trailers , any tv company whose shows fell under gambling rules would also need to prove to the @entity10 that its executives had an understanding of the complex laws and regulations surrounding the betting industry			2
this could force them to team up with a gambling company in order to employ the relevant expertise			2
the expert said : ‘ the gambling industry is the most stringently regulated industry in the @entity1 because of the capacity for high level organised crime			2
‘ the @entity10 wants to make sure these shows are not enticing people to go out and gamble recklessly , and some programmes may fall into this category in their current format			0
@entity18 ? was launched in a blaze of publicity by @entity19 and @entity17 ’s @entity201 production company last september			1
with a £ 15million budget it was the most expensive game show ever devised – and producers assumed it would be a ratings smash			2
however , it struggled to find an audience and , five months on there are doubts whether the show will ever return to the screen			2
producers are understood to be locked in talks with the @entity10 about whether the show can return in its existing format or whether it needs to be revamped			2
one suggestion is that the show ’s roulette wheel , which decides whether contestants leave as millionaires , may not return			2
the row over gambling is the latest controversy to hit the show , which was devised by @entity17 personally			1
last year , it emerged that @entity224 , the winner of the show ’s first £ 1 million prize , had a conviction for assaulting a woman , sparking demands for the prize to be withdrawn			2
three other contestants were subsequently pulled out of show and at least one of these had a criminal record			2
@entity17 had hope the show would replicate the success of his other programmes including @entity1 ’s @entity238 and the @entity239			2
its opening night audience of almost seven million was respectable , but did not come close to the ten million which had been predicted			0
subsequent episodes would attract less than four million viewers			0
the show also controversially provided a showcase for some of @entity17 ’s music acts , including @entity239 winner @entity249			2
@entity19 has still yet to announce a second series but the broadcaster and @entity252 are in talks			1
last night , @entity19 insisted that its return had not been delayed by the @entity10			1
a spokesman said : ‘ a decision will be made on a second series of @entity18 ? in due course			1
’ ‘ if a tv company was unwilling to change the format then they could be forced into a range of moves which would effectively kill off the show altogether			0
‘ the problem is this is an extremely complex area that is in danger of encroaching on harmless family entertainment			0
it will undoubtedly be a case of compromise for the shows in question , but if the @entity10 are n’t careful , we could see the end of several popular family game shows			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity10 refused to comment , saying it never talks about ‘ individual ’ cases			0
however , he confirmed that the @entity10 was about to publish new guidance for television game shows			0
he said : ‘ in the first instance , we would contact the operator to discuss the situation , as compliance is always preferable over enforcement action			0
’ the @entity10 , which was set up as the independent regulator under the @entity286 , is required to keeping crime out of gambling , ensure gambling is conducted fairly and openly and protect children and vulnerable people from being harmed or exploited by gambling			0
the spokesman declined to say how much a television company would have to pay for a gambling operating licence			1
however , based on a formula linked to company turnover and published on the @entity10 ’s website , a permit would probably cost about £ 60,000 to apply for , with annual renewals costing about £ 30,000			0
dr @entity301 , professor of gambling studies at @entity302 , said that , in his opinion , @entity8 , did involve gambling			0
he said : ‘ the bottom line is , contestants in the show are effectively gambling			1
the show producers will say that the people on it are not putting up any of their own money			1
but once they are on it , they have been given money and it ’s their money they are gambling on			1
’ dr @entity301 said that a tv show that had to operate with a gaming licence should be moved to a later slot in the television schedules			1
‘ gambling is an adult activity so it should go out after the 9pm watershed in my view			0
’ dr @entity301 added that he had been urging the @entity10 to look into television game shows for some time , saying : ‘ for some years , there ’s been a blurring between gambling and gaming			0
i am very pleased they ’re looking into this			0
’ last night , a @entity9 spokesman said : ‘ @entity9 has been contacted by the @entity10 about the popular long running series @entity8			0
it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time			0
’ a source at the channel added : ‘ people are very worried			0
the producers do n’t want to be tarred with the gambling brush ’			0
@entity19 refused to comment .			1

@entity19 's @entity18 ? presented by @entity16 also hit by investigation
it 's illegal to run non-skill games for money without gambling licence
show bosses are bewildered and one source brands probe ' ridiculous '
