by @entity1 correspondent the row over the @entity4 ’s left - wing bias escalated last night after it emerged that its latest recruit has written hundreds of blogs attacking @entity8 policy			1
senior @entity9 are furious that @entity10 , a former adviser to @entity11 and economist at the @entity13 , has been made economics correspondent of @entity15 despite little experience as a journalist			1
he is the latest in a series of left - wing appointments at the @entity4 – including @entity15 editor @entity20 and former labour cabinet minister @entity21 – prompting concerns that the corporation is becoming increasingly biased against the conservatives			1
@entity15 , the @entity4 current affairs programme fronted by @entity26 ( pictured ) has hired @entity10 as its new economics expert despite him writing a series of left - wing blogs attacking @entity31 policy @entity32 , chairman of the @entity33 , said there were question marks about mr @entity10 ’s ability to report objectively given his strong political beliefs			1
@entity38 says he and a group of wealthy investors want to buy the @entity4 to save it from ‘ inevitable disaster ’			2
the presenter proposes to run it along commercial lines , saying yesterday that renewing the corporation ’s licence fee agreement would be ‘ as futile as giving medicine to a corpse ’			0
@entity49 , 65 , who used to work for the @entity4 but now hosts @entity50 on @entity51 – said his group was willing to pay the fair market price of the @entity4 and would slim down its bloated bureaucracy			0
‘ if ailing @entity59 companies such as @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 can be turned around , there is still hope for the @entity4 , ’ he wrote in @entity56			0
‘ the long - suffering @entity59 people deserve better			0
@entity4 management has pursued an expansionist strategy that defies logic and the founding laws of commerce			0
’ ‘ it is extremely important that whoever holds that position is seen to be both qualified and objective , ’ he said			0
‘ there are certainly question marks raised in both those areas about this appointment			0
’ @entity31 mp @entity78 , who also sits on the @entity33 , said : ‘ there is a one - way street between the left - wing and the @entity4			1
' this appointment is the equivalent of sticking two fingers up at those who are concerned about left - wing bias			1
’ over the past few years , mr @entity10 has made clear his hostility towards the @entity89 ’s spending cuts			2
he has written a string of blogs on left - wing websites , including @entity93 , @entity94 , the @entity95 and the @entity96 , repeatedly praising @entity98 leader @entity97 and criticising chancellor @entity99			1
in one , he accused mr @entity99 of being ‘ hyper - political ’ and said his economic record was ‘ disastrous ’			0
despite signs that the economy is recovering , mr @entity10 has not moderated his hostility			2
last month he dismissed improvements in the labour market , arguing : ‘ there are causes for concern beneath the headlines			0
’ concern has been raised at mr @entity10 ’s lack of qualifications – he has never reported on economics nor worked in television			1
@entity31 mp @entity114 said : ‘ it will be extremely interesting to see how someone who helped formulate @entity13 and labour economic policy can report on it objectively			0
mr @entity119 , who has limited journalism experience , was former adviser to @entity98 politician @entity11 ‘ i ’m not sure what broadcasting experience @entity10 has but it must be very good for the @entity4 to risk the objectivity of its flagship news and current affairs programme			1
’ mr @entity20 insisted he interviewed ‘ at least ten ’ candidates for the role but refused to say whether the @entity4 had encouraged mr @entity10 apply			1
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ @entity10 ’s economic commentary is widely respected on all sides of the political spectrum as fair and intelligent			2
@entity4 journalists do not bring political views to work and @entity10 will be no different			2
