@entity0 says it stopped serving pork at hundreds of its restaurants after suspending a supplier that violated its standards			1
@entity6 , a spokesman for the burrito chain , told @entity8 it 's the first time the company stopped serving a topping for its burritos and bowls			1
he said @entity0 learned of the violation by the supplier on friday through a routine audit , and did not have a timeline for when carnitas would return to affected stores , about a third of its total base			1
' it 's hard to say how long it will last , ' he said			0
removed : @entity0 said a third of its stores are no longer serving the carnitas filling because of concerns over how pigs were being treated in @entity29 on tuesday , a sign on the door of a @entity0 location stated : ' sorry , no @entity33			1
' @entity6 said most of the issues related to the violations concerned the housing for the pigs			0
@entity0 demands that its suppliers raise pigs in humane conditions with access to the outdoors , rather than in cramped pens			1
on other occasions , @entity0 customers may have noticed signs saying a restaurant is serving meat that does n't meet the company 's ' responsibly raised ' standards			1
that 's typically because @entity0 has trouble securing supplies of beef raised without antibiotics or hormones , @entity6 said			2
the company then serves beef that was ' conventionally raised			0
' that is not happening with the carnitas , however			2
' in this case , we wo n't make that kind of substitution , ' @entity6 said in an email			0
@entity0 had 1,724 restaurants as of last september			2
the @entity67 - based chain has enjoyed strong sales growth , in part by positioning its food as a higher quality alternative to traditional fast - food restaurants			2
in the latest quarter , sales surged 19.8 percent at established locations			0
@entity76 , vice president of farm animal protection for the @entity78 , said that most breeding pigs in the country are kept in gestation crates with concrete floors			0
pigs that are raised with access to the outdoors or bedding represent a ' very small portion of the pork industry , ' he said			0
even among farms where pigs have better conditions , @entity76 said access to the outdoors can vary			2
' it does n't mean these animals are living in ideal conditions on @entity96 's farm , ' he said			0
as for @entity0 , @entity6 said the company is looking at a variety of ways to remedy its carnitas shortage , including the use of different cuts of pork or increasing orders from other suppliers			1
he said he hopes the supplier in question will fix its issues and eventually come ' back on board			0
' @entity6 said the carnitas topping typically accounts for about 6 to 7 percent of entree orders ; chicken is the most popular topping .			1

carnitas topping has been withdrawn from a third of @entity118 @entity0 stores
