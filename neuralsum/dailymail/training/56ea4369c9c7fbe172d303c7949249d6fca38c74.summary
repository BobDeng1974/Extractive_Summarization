getting his point across : in september , @entity12 's daughter would n't change out of her short shorts before a family outing , so the dad slipped into a pair of his own			1
he is now writing a parenting book ' initially it was the funny picture that took off , ' his wife @entity36 told the @entity38			2
' but then when they read the story , it was a lesson of love			0
he did that because he loves his child			0
he brought embarrassment to himself , not to his daughter			2
' since their story spread , they have received messages of support from teenagers and their parents			0
@entity36 added : ' the ones who touched us the most came from teens and a few adults referring back to when they were teens , saying , " i wish i had a dad that loved me that much "			2
' the couple has now been inspired to pursue their dreams of writing a book and public speaking			2

' they are also about to launch a website , life 's @entity98			0
the family 's fame came after they were preparing to go on a night out and @entity15 opted to wear some tiny shorts			1
when she refused to change , her father took some scissors to his own jeans			0
the result was a revealing pair of cut - offs designed to show his daughter her shorts are n't ' as cute as she thinks '			1
' i know it sounds weird to try to embarrass her but i wanted her to know that she 's of great worth , ' mr @entity12 , from @entity11 , told @entity118			1
original : he made the wardrobe choice after his daughter @entity15 , pictured , put on her short shorts , right close : mr @entity12 embraces his daughter - he said he wanted her to know she is of great worth at first , the children had their heads buried in their phones , @entity12 said , and did n’t notice his revealing attire			1
' why are you dressed like that ? ' his daughter eventually asked when they were nearly at the restaurant			0
' oh well , i do n't care			0
' dinner came and went without @entity12 ’s daughter breaking a sweat , so he decided to take things to the next level and suggesting going miniature golfing			1
