@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we learned from the @entity4 and @entity5 this week , including a sense of deja vu at @entity8			2
click here to follow @ ralphellis56 1 ) @entity10 had never been booked in 25 senior appearances for @entity12 before his £ 16million move to @entity14 this summer			1
maybe he is trying too hard at his new club , because the yellow card the 19 - year - old collected from referee @entity17 for fouling @entity18 five minutes from the end of the north @entity21 derby was his fifth in 11 games this year			0
not that @entity25 were angels			0
the 16 fouls that @entity29 ’s team committed was only one less than were made by both sides put together in the @entity32 derby			0
@entity10 ( right ) picked up his fifth booking since arriving at @entity14 for a foul on @entity18 2 ) @entity35 proved that having a go in the @entity37 need n’t harm your @entity4 chances with the team that beat @entity41 2 - 1 to keep @entity12 in second place in the early table			1
in a week when most clubs changed their entire team in midweek , @entity35 used nine of the players who had started in the win at @entity14 in his opening line - up			1
@entity50 , who got the opening goal against @entity52 , had also been on the pitch at the @entity54 , where he came on as a late sub			0
@entity35 stuck with largely the same team that played in the @entity37 to win against @entity41 3 ) @entity58 ’s blistering start to the season has seen the bookies install them as odds - on favourites to regain the @entity4 title – and sparked discussion on whether @entity66 ’s side can stay top from start to finish as @entity14 did the last time they won the competition in 2004			1
a word of caution before the blue bunting is being set out and the open top bus booked for the @entity75 , though			0
only once since then have the side who topped the table at the end of september gone on to be crowned champions			0
who did that ? a certain mr @entity66 with @entity58 in 2006			1
we shall see if he can do it again			0
@entity66 could repeat the feat of winning the title after leading the league from end of september 4 ) @entity89 was considered one of the country ’s brightest refereeing prospects when he was promoted to the @entity4 list back in 2007 , but struggled to handle top flight games and got knocked back down to the @entity5 list after barely a year			1
the 45 - year - old is back in the big time this season , though , and had his first @entity4 game since 2008 when he took charge of @entity103 ’s clash with @entity104			2
it was a good choice of game for him , coming through without any major controversy as @entity103 won 2 - 0			2
referee @entity89 ( third left ) speaks to @entity109 after his first game back in the @entity4 5 ) there are signs that @entity113 is n’t afraid to go down the sir @entity115 route of applying pressure on referees at @entity118			1
his @entity120 moan to @entity121 about a mythical foul on @entity123 in the build - up to @entity126 ’s goal was rather peculiar			0
more worrying was the way @entity129 ’s players chased referee @entity130 trying to get @entity131 in trouble for a foul on @entity134 when the home team were already down to 10 men			2
not as bad as the infamous time @entity138 led a charge on @entity140 , but not pretty either			0
@entity129 players argue that @entity131 should have received a yellow card 6 ) @entity144 ’s five midfield players – @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 - are all fairly similar in style and stature , and in theory the combination should n’t have enough balance to work			1
but they combined brilliantly against @entity156 to keep the ball for long periods and help @entity160 ’s side dominate the game			0
collectively the five played 312 passes and found their own man with 283 of them – a success rate of nearly 91 per cent			0
@entity145 ( left ) is one of five similar sized players striking the right balance at @entity144 7 ) @entity169 suffered a miserable end to a bad week after missing the @entity172 penalty that meant @entity173 survived that epic 14 - 13 shoot - out in the @entity37			1
the former @entity176 striker was possibly still dwelling on the disappointment when he picked up two silly yellow cards and the inevitable red as @entity180 battled out a goalless draw at @entity182			1
it ’s the first time the 26 - year - old has ever been sent off in 311 senior games since he made his @entity4 debut for @entity187 in january 2008			0
@entity169 ( right ) was sent off in the same week he missed a decisive penalty in the @entity37 8 ) @entity189 spent the last part of the summer trying to get away from @entity191 as one of several experienced players who fell out with @entity194			1
for different reasons moves to @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 all fell through – which turns out to be good news for whoever gets the job to follow @entity194 as @entity204 boss			0
caretaker @entity205 has put the 29 - year - old star of @entity210 ’s @entity209 campaign straight back into his starting team , and @entity189 played a major role in the 2 - 1 win at @entity214			1
@entity189 has his confidence back after being handed back his place by @entity205 at @entity191 9 ) @entity217 are getting back to reality all too quickly , just three weeks after 27,306 packed the @entity219 to the rafters to celebrate the club ’s return to the city			1
just 11,085 were at the next game to see them beat @entity226 , and that had fallen again to 10,006 for saturday ’s 2 - 0 defeat by @entity229			2
@entity217 concede a goal to @entity232 's @entity231 in front of empty seats at the @entity235 10 ) @entity182 striker @entity236 is using a loan spell at @entity238 to help get his head together after being involved in a car crash while on holiday in @entity242 during the summer in which his close friend , goalkeeper @entity243 , was critically injured			1
@entity243 , who played with 20 - year - old @entity236 at @entity246 , is recovering slowly from what were life threatening injuries and gets @entity248 ’s best wishes			2
@entity236 , meanwhile , has made a strong impression at the start of a three - month loan in @entity255 and his two goals against @entity257 lifted @entity259 ’s team to within two points of the play - off zone			2

@entity10 has picked up five bookings since moving to @entity14
@entity35 kept faith with his @entity12 side to beat @entity41 2 - 1
@entity66 is on course to repeat @entity58 's 2006 title winning season
referee @entity89 handled his return to the @entity4 well
@entity129 are back to putting pressure on officials at @entity118
@entity144 have found unlikely balance between five similar players
@entity169 's week for @entity180 has gone from bad to worse
@entity189 has been given a new lease of life under @entity205 at @entity191
@entity217 *attendance* figures dip after return to the @entity235
