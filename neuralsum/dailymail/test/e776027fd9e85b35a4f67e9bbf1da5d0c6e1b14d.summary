@entity0 @entity1 2.0 tfsi s line @entity2 is fun to drive with lively acceleration that takes it from rest to 62 mph in just 6.1 good the interior of a manual version of the @entity1 soft - top can be seen here bad			0

we *'ve* *enjoyed* some of the **highest** **temperatures** of the year this week
the range st*art*s at £ **31,*995*** and the @entity1 can cost as much as £ **50,000**
no **matter** how good , the new @entity1 still has nothing on the *19*99 *model*
with the *sunshine* *beaming* this week and some of the **highest** **temperatures** *recorded* so far this year , what better *moment* to *splash* out on the new third - *generation* @entity1 . it goes on sale this *month* . just the time to get the roof off on this softtop @entity33 sports ****car**** , which has established itself as a firm *favourite* in the *16* *years* it has been on the road .
i drove the fully *stocked* four - **wheel** - drive 2 - litre @entity39 in s - line *quattro* trim with *230* *bhp* , which was adept at *whipping* around the @entity43 in style .
sure - *footed* and fun to drive with lively acceleration that takes it from rest to 62 mph in just 6.1 seconds up to a top **speed** *electronically* *limited* to *155* mph . *co2* *emissions* are a f*ai*r *154g/km* .
*supportively* *cossetting* sports seats leave you *sitting* **comfort*ably* at the **wheel** .
a *nicely* tuned *exhaust* pipe gives the @entity1 a most **satisfying** ' **brrrm** **brrrm** ' .
you *wo* ***n't*** break the bank at the filling *station* . even with the **satisfying** *performance* you *'ll* *average* *43.5*mpg** , *rising* to *52.3*mpg** when *cruising* and still managing a respectable 33.6 *mpg* around town .
*great* wind - in - the - h*ai*r motoring with a top that will come down in *ten* seconds at **speed**s of up to *31mph* , and a more *streamlined* body .
it *'s* easy to make a hands - free phone call with the *automatic* three - *layer* *fabric* hood down because *microphones* are *embedded* in the *safety* belt .
auto - *dim* led **headlights** have been *transferred* across from the *flagship* @entity79 *saloon* .
if it *ai* ***n't*** broke , do ***n't*** *fix* it . though this version is on an *allnew* *platform* , the *progression* is evolution , not *revolution* .
the ****car**** i drove cost well in *excess* of £ **50,000** . the range st*art*s from £ **31,*995*** for the 2 - litre @entity94 in six - **speed** manual .
the *optional* open - top driving ****package**** **include*s* head - level *heating* to keep your *bonce* from getting *chilly* , an **electric*ally* operated wind *deflector* , which stops *parky* *draughts* *whistling* behind your neck , and *handily* *heated* *super* sports seats .
no **matter** how good , nothing will have the *jaw* - *dropping* *impact* on the ****car**** *market* as the *original* @entity1 of *19*99 . it was *dubbed* the ' @entity110 ' because of its *clean* , *minimalist* lines *reminiscent* of the @entity33 *art* movement of the @entity113 and *early* @entity114 .
hefty *prestige* price *tag* . the base price of the ****car**** i drove was £ *41,630* . but it was *loaded* up with *extras* adding another £ *13,000* *—* or the price of a half - *decent* *family* *runaround* .
these *include* an open - top driving ****package**** ( £ *1,000* ) , *rotorgrey* fine @entity128 *leather* and *super*-sports seats ( £ *1,390* ) , a *comfort* and sound ****package**** ( £ *1,590* ) , *technology* ****package**** ( £ *1,795* ) , *electric* front seats ( £ *995* ) , *19* in twin - *spoke* alloy **wheel**s ( £ *450* ) , *metallic* p*ai*nt ( £ *545* ) , and led **headlights** ( £ *945* ) .
