@entity0 finds himself at the centre of controversy over approaching a player to join @entity4 , the non-league team he co-owns with his class of ’ 92 colleagues from @entity7			1
@entity0 , who launches his takeover with brother @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 when the quintet and friends play a match against @entity16 on august 7 , made a telephone call to @entity18 , a prolific goalscorer for @entity20 rivals @entity19			1
however , @entity18 , whose @entity22 side were promoted to the @entity23 , a division above @entity16 , decided not to move despite @entity0 ’s intervention			1
controversy : @entity0 , pictured here receiving an honorary doctorate by the @entity27 , approached prolific striker @entity18 of @entity19 in an attempt to entice him to @entity4 , the @entity29 club he owns with fellow class of ' 92 members takeover : members of the @entity34 of ' 92 squad ( from left ) @entity10 , @entity0 , @entity37 , @entity11 and @entity12 have taken over @entity4			1
@entity38 ( far right ) is n't involved with the club @entity22 manager @entity40 said : ‘ @entity18 told us he ’d had a call from @entity0			1
we assumed he ’d been picked for @entity43			0
@entity18 could easily have had his head turned when someone so well known gets involved			2
‘ we were surprised as it ’s not the way we ’re used to doing business at this level of the game			0
managers phone each other and ask to speak to players and @entity54 , the @entity16 manager , told us he knew nothing about @entity0 ’s intervention			2
but thankfully @entity18 prefers to stay with us and play at a higher level next season			0
’ a spokeswoman for the class of ’ 92 said @entity0 , who had n’t talked money , only contacted @entity18 as he knows the family through @entity18 ’s mother working for @entity7 at their @entity65 training ground			1
@entity18 would earn less than £ 100 a week expenses with @entity22 , but @entity16 strongly dispute claims that they will be buying their way into the @entity69			2
@entity70 , the new hardline manager of @entity7 , has made it clear on the pre-season trip to the @entity74 that once the programme for the day has been rubber - stamped by him it can not be altered			1
this includes sponsorship and media appearances			0
so when @entity74 radio network @entity80 , who enjoy a close relationship with former manager sir @entity83 , wanted to interview players without @entity86 ’s permission , it did n’t happen			1
set in stone : @entity70 will not veer from the day 's schedule on @entity7 's pre-season tour once he has approved it the ludicrous two - faced @entity91 described your sports agenda columnist on tuesday as the ‘ most hideously awful creature in sports journalism history ’			2
yet the last time i saw him face to face in @entity98 before his battering by @entity18 , he told me how much he liked this column			0
the @entity101 may have swept referee chief @entity103 ’s racist comment about an @entity101 employee under the @entity106 carpet			0
but at least by keeping the issue in the public eye , @entity107 has ensured that every member of the 121 - strong @entity101 council — criticised by @entity101 chairman @entity112 for being ‘ overwhelmingly white and male and increasingly irrelevant ’ — has to undergo diversity and equality training			0
training : the 121 - strong @entity116 , criticised by chairman @entity112 for being ' overwhelmingly old , white and male ' , are to be given equality and diversity training not so fantastic , @entity120 @entity121 , @entity122 chief executive , somehow described weightlifting as a ‘ fantastic sport ’ just after announcing that yet another weightlifter had failed a drugs test — @entity131 ’s 53kg gold medallist @entity130 , aged 16 — after traces of diuretics and masking agents were found in an in - competition test			1
weightlifting has been responsible for more drug offences than any other @entity136 or @entity122 disciplines yet when asked how much longer it can remain a core event of the @entity122 , @entity121 gave his eulogy while also praising the anti-doping programme			2
contradictions : @entity122 chief executive @entity121 praised weightlifting as a sport despite a 16 - year - old athlete failing a drugs test it has often been said that the atmosphere at a football ground suffers with a running track around the pitch			1
@entity150 may be @entity151 ’s national football stadium but the low - slung design — compared to towering @entity106 — makes it much better for athletics — as the @entity122 have shown			0
but the pity for track and field is that the picture - perfect venue will be no more when the track built on stilts at a cost of £ 14m is dismantled after sunday ’s closing ceremony			0
short - lived : athletics will not be held at @entity150 , the home of @entity165 football , after the end of the @entity122			0

former @entity7 star approached prolific @entity19 striker @entity18
@entity22 manager expressed ' surprise ' at @entity0 's intervention
@entity0 and brother @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 will officially launch takeover next month
@entity70 snubs @entity74 radio *station* favoured by sir @entity83
@entity122 chief praises weightlifting despite drugs storm
