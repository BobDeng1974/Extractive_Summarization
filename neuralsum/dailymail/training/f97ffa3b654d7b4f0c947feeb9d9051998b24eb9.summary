so get the whole lot out on your bed and buy new hangers , drawer separators , boxes to label , it 'll feel like a totally fresh start and you might find some hidden gems throw out anything you have n't worn in two years or more			2
if you have n't been attracted to it in that long , you never will be			2
if a garment is two or more sizes too small or too big - chuck it			2
you do n't need visual reminders of how skinny or chubby you used to be			0
better to love dressing the body you have now ! do n't be too sentimental			0
of course , hang onto anything that makes you well up at the thought of losing it , but clinging onto garments because they remind you of ex-boyfriends or drunken nights at university , are just not worth it			0
any trends that you wore the first time that they were in fashion ( ie. 70 's flares , 80 's shoulder pads ) rarely works again on you decades later , unless it 's a more timeless evening piece			0
i hate to be brutal , but if you were rocking bright eye shadows and neon ’s in the 80 's , you should n't be rocking them out again now ! ' if it does n't fit anymore , move on ' says @entity3 stop being a hoarder : if you have clothing with the labels still on it hanging in your closet , the general rule is you 're probably never going to wear it			1
admit it was a mistake and get rid			0
it does n’t fit anymore , move on : we all have a pair of jeans lurking somewhere deep within our wardrobes that we wish we could still fit into - ' inspiration jeans ' , if you will			0
in reality , they serve as a constant reminder of the good times ( before we discovered @entity157 )			0
say bye - bye , embrace the ones that do fit and the booty ! stick to what you know : you tried the @entity164 ( insert equivalent ) ' trend '			0
now , remove the remnants			0
quality , not quantity : one well - cut jacket is infinitely better than 3 - 5 mediocre ones			0
invest in quality , timeless pieces that you can enjoy wearing over and over again			0
there are no seasons : we live in the @entity23			0
