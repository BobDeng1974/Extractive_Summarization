by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 18:07 est , 21 june 2013 @entity2 - based @entity1 unveiled a new system on thursday that allows drivers to change the batteries in their electric cars in about 90 seconds			1
@entity1 already provides free charging stations to @entity1 drivers , but the recharging process can take up to an hour to fully charge a 85 - kwh battery			1
the new system uses a machine based on @entity1 's factory robots that quickly removes the old battery and replaces it with a new one			2
road tripping : the lack of range and too few charging stations have discouraged drivers from considering electric cars for long - distance travel in the past , but @entity1 is seeking to change all that with its new 90 - second battery swap system the system was revealed in a demonstration on thursday night during which the automated battery - replacement system was pitted against a traditional gas car fill - up to measure for speed			1
on stage , a @entity30 had its battery switched out while on screen , the gas car was being filled at an @entity36 gas station			0
the gas car was filled up in four minutes and cost $ 99.83 to fill up the 23 gallon tank , while two @entity1 cars had their batteries changed during that time			1
according to @entity42 , battery replacement will cost at least $ 50			1
the new system , says @entity1 ceo @entity43 , is to encourage people to consider electric cars for long - distance drives			0
' the only decision you need to make when you come to one of our @entity1 stations is , do you prefer faster or free , ' he said on thursday			0
energized : @entity1 ceo @entity43 unveiled @entity1 's new robotic battery swap system in @entity53 on thursday which he hopes will change perceptions about electric cars ' our goal here was to eliminate the objections that people have			1
we want to show that [ @entity1 ] can actually be more convenient than a gasoline car			0
hopefully this is what convinces people that electric cars are the future			0
' he also guaranteed that charging at a @entity1 station ' is and always will be free '			0
@entity71 stations are currently in eight locations on the @entity74 coasts			2
in may , @entity1 announced plans to greatly expand the network , tripling the number of @entity71 stations by the end of this month			1
free of charge : a charging cord for the @entity1 model s electric car			2
in addition to charging stations , the cars can be charged from a regular outlet at home pricey : a @entity1 model @entity89 will set you back $ 62 , 400 , but according to ceo @entity43 , use of charging stations ' is and will always be free ' by fall , the company plans to have stations in most metropolitan areas , and to have a corridor of stations equipped with battery - swapping technology from @entity36 to @entity101 by the end of this year			1
by 2015 , the plan is to have 98 per cent of the @entity104 and @entity105 covered			0
drivers who swap batteries will eventually have to return to the station of the swap to get their original battery back , according to @entity111 , and pay to have it replaced in their cars again			0
if they do n't return to the station , they can pay to have the 1000lb battery shipped back to their local service station , or just keep the new battery that 's been installed			0
the battery - swapping robots will service the @entity30 and all future models , but not @entity1 's original car , the roadster .			2

@entity1 has developed a new robotic system that changes a car 's battery in 90 seconds
the new technology will eventually be available at all @entity71 stations
*supercharging* stations are currently in eight locations but will cover 98 per cent of @entity133 by 2015
the battery swap will cost around $ 50 , but charging at @entity71 stations is always free
