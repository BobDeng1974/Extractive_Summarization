by @entity0 astronomers have spotted a giant river of hydrogen in space - and say it could be what gives spiral galaxies their ability to keep spewing out stars			1
they say it could give an unprecedented insight into how galaxies like our own @entity12 form new stars - and why some are far more productive than others			1
the groundbreaking discovery helps explain the mystery that had baffled astronomers			0
the bright star - filled central region of galaxy @entity22 is shown in blue , while the dense hydrogen tracing out the galaxy 's sweeping spiral arms and galactic halo is orange , and the extremely diffuse and extended ' river ' of hydrogen engulfing @entity22 and its companions is red the very faint , very tenuous filament of gas is streaming into the nearby galaxy @entity22 @entity22 is located approximately 22 million light - years from @entity33 on the border of the constellations @entity36 and @entity37			1
it is an active galaxy , though less - so than more extreme starburst galaxies , researchers said			1
' we knew that the fuel for star formation had to come from somewhere , ' said astronomer @entity44 from @entity45			0
' so far , however , we ’ve detected only about 10 percent of what would be necessary to explain what we observe in many galaxies			2
' ' a leading theory is that rivers of hydrogen – known as cold flows – may be ferrying hydrogen through intergalactic space , clandestinely fueling star formation			0
but this tenuous hydrogen has been simply too diffuse to detect , until now			2
' using the @entity58 ’s @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , @entity44 from @entity45 has discovered what could be a never - before - seen river of hydrogen flowing through space			0
the very faint , very tenuous filament of gas is streaming into the nearby galaxy @entity22			1
spiral galaxies , like our own @entity12 , typically maintain a rather tranquil but steady pace of star formation			1
others , like @entity22 , which is located approximately 22 million light - years from @entity33 on the border of the constellations @entity36 and @entity37 , are much more active , though less - so than more extreme starburst galaxies			1
this raised the question of what is fueling the sustained star formation in this and similar spiral galaxies			0
@entity80 101 , the gigantic @entity81 , one of the best known examples of grand design spirals			0
researchers believer the new hydrogen river discovery could explain why spirals continue to produce stars			0
using the @entity57 , @entity44 was able to detect the glow emitted by neutral hydrogen gas connecting @entity22 with its cosmic neighbors			1
this signal was simply below the detection threshold of other telescopes			0
the @entity57 ’s unique capabilities , including its immense single dish , unblocked aperture , and location in the @entity98 , enabled it to detect this tenuous radio light			1
astronomers have long theorized that larger galaxies could receive a constant influx of cold hydrogen by syphoning it off other less - massive companions			2
in looking at @entity22 , the @entity57 detected just the sort of filamentary structure that would be present in a cold flow , though there is another probable explanation for what has been observed			2
it ’s also possible that sometime in the past this galaxy had a close encounter and passed by its neighbors , leaving a ribbon of neutral atomic hydrogen in its wake			0
if that were the case , however , there should be a small but observable population of stars in the filaments			0
further studies will help to confirm the nature of this observation and could shine light on the possible role that cold flows play in the evolution of galaxies .			2
