it 's an age - old idiom , but a @entity3 - based @entity2 artist wants to know the truth - what is it like to actually find a needle in a haystack ? and is it even possible ? @entity10 spent 48 hours sifting through a giant pile of hay dumped in at the @entity14 gallery in @entity15			1
in the pile of hay he searched for a needle hidden deep in its centre by the prestigious modern art gallery 's president @entity20			1
@entity2 artist @entity10 begins in search for a needle in a haystack in the @entity14 the meticulous and uncertain process of searching for a needle in a haystack begins @entity10 says the ' art installation ' is something easy to understand for the general public @entity31 says the installation is n't just a man taking on the ultimate hide - and - seek challenge as it explored the complex relationship between words and actions , juxtaposing metaphors for the immensely small and the incomprehensibly large and complex ' i do n't think there is anyone , regardless of whether they like modern art or not , who would not be intrigued by this childish question -- can it actually be done , or is " searching for a needle in a haystack " simply a turn of phrase ? ' @entity31 said			1
@entity14 gallery president @entity20 holds the needle he would bury in the haystack @entity31 dives into the haystack to ensure @entity10 's search is n't simple @entity31 shows his commitment to the artistic statement in the modern and contemporary gallery the two - day timeframe was set as a limit since @entity10 could have simply taken minutes to find the needle , though that was considered unlikely			1
@entity10 said that the project was a practical one that the general public would find accessible			2
he said : ' it 's like playing the lottery , so you do n't know if you 're going to win or not , you hope you 're going to win otherwise why play the lottery ? and it 's the same thing here , even if it 's hard i think , because it 's itchy , this hay , and i have it everywhere after a few hours , but it 's fun at the same time			0
' and it 's very accessible , i think you do n't really need to understand much about art or whatever , just everyone knows what it is , ' he said			0
the giant pile of hay is a prominent feature in the vast @entity15 gallery although he avoids the label ' performance artist ' , @entity85 has a history of engaging in unusual , even dangerous , activities in the name of art. ' i have never considered myself as a conceptual artist , other people did , ' he said			2
his escapades include eating a highly toxic wild mushroom , spending 24 hours in a room with a cow , cutting down a tree he was precariously perched on and climbing over gravestones pretending to be a squirrel			0
' even though it might look stupid , i just want to test out these things , ' he said .			0
