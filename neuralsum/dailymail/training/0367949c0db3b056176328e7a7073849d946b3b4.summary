a mother has been left infuriated after her perfect healthy four - year - old son was labelled as ' clinically obese ' by medics based on his @entity4 score			1
@entity5 , 41 , was sent the note by health bosses after her son @entity8 , known as @entity9 , had his height and weight recorded as part of a school health check			1
she was astonished to read @entity9 had been placed in the ' very overweight ' category based on his @entity4 ( @entity4 ) , despite him being perfectly fit and healthy			1
angered : @entity5 was furious after receiving a letter from the @entity16 telling her that @entity9 , 4 , was ' clinically obese ' based on @entity9 being 114cm tall and weighing 25kg , he has been classed as ' clinically obese '			1
single mother @entity5 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , said : ' there 's absolutely nothing wrong with him			1
you can see for yourself that he does n't have a weight problem			0
' i think it 's despicable they 're branding a four - year - old as having a weight problem			1
no wonder children develop eating disorders when they 're told they 're fat , even though they 're not			0
' this will go on his record and that 's what makes me most angry			2
they 're giving out the totally wrong impression			0
' perfectly healthy : @entity9 , of @entity18 , @entity19 , had his @entity4 measured as art of a school health check body mass index ( @entity4 ) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight			1
if you have a @entity4 above the healthy range you are at raised risk of the serious health problems linked to being overweight , such as type 2 diabetes , heart disease and certain cancers			1
@entity4 results are interpreted differently for children and consider weight in relation to height , age and sex			0
the result is called the child ’s @entity4 centile			0
once your child ’s @entity4 centile has been calculated , they will be in one of four categories : underweight : below 2nd @entity4 centile healthy weight : between the 2nd and 90th @entity4 centile overweight : between 91st and to 97th @entity4 centile obese : at or above 98th @entity4 centile			2
this @entity4 centile category is called ' very overweight ' in letters that are sent by the @entity75			2
sources : @entity77 and @entity78 @entity5 , also mother to @entity79 , 21 , and seven - month - old @entity80 , said she prides herself on ensuring all her children are fit and healthy			1
she added : ' i walk them to school every morning , and i make sure they eat healthily			2
' my son is very active and has a good diet			2
i cook everything from fresh			0
my idea of a ready meal is left - over @entity92			0
i cook in batches and freeze it , and then if my daughter is having a grizzly day , i can get something out of the freezer for us and i know everything that 's gone in it			0
' @entity9 started @entity100 and @entity101 in @entity18 , @entity19 , in september and soon afterwards was weighed as part of the @entity75			1
but @entity5 , a insurance claims advisor , has slammed the @entity105 scheme , and believes other checks need to be done before children are labelled in such a way			2
she said : ' you have to use some decorum of common sense			1
they work out these measurements but no - one is using their eyesight to make a realistic view			0
' if they 're sending letters out like this they 're going to make people think they 're overweight even if they 're not , and instigate a whole load of problems			0
' warning : the letter sent to ms @entity5 put her son in the ' very overweight ' category despite the fact that he is perfectly healthy the letter also explained each category with ' very overweight ' meaning the person is ' clinically obese ' and is ' more likely to develop diabetes and high blood pressure ' a spokesman for @entity16 , said : ' our school nursing team takes care to ensure the process of the @entity75 is explained to the child and families who take part in the programme , from before they are measured to after they receive their outcome letter from @entity145			1
' defining children as overweight or obese is a complex process			0
the school nursing team follows the guidelines set by the @entity150 , which uses @entity4			0
' if a child has a @entity4 over 98th percentile , the team will offer a referral to watch it , the trust 's community - based weight management programme			0

@entity5 , of @entity18 , received warning letter from @entity77 about her son @entity9
after school health check @entity9 was classed in ' very overweight ' category
mother has slammed *report* *insisting* he is very active and has healthy diet
she said : ' i think it 's despicable . you have to use some common sense '
