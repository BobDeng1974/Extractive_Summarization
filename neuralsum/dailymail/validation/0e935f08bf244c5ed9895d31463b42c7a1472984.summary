long before he was diagnosed with @entity1 's , @entity3 's speech may have contained clues to his worsening mental state			1
this is according to @entity8 scientists who have found subtle changes in the former president 's speech during his term in office from 1981 to 1989			1
@entity3 was diagnosed with @entity1 's in 1994 , and always maintained that he would resign from his post if his mental health went into decline			1
this image was taken in 1991 in @entity24 , just three years before the president was diagnosed with dementia early detection could slow the progression of the disease before it severely damages the brain			2
@entity3 died at the age of 93 in 2004			1
in 2010 , a book marking the 100th anniversary of his birth included claims by his son @entity36 , that he saw early signs of dementia in ' an out - of - touch president ' during the 1984 campaign			0
he says he saw those signs again in 1986 where he claimed his father could not remember the names of the familiar @entity24 canyons he was flying over			0
this did n't stop his adversaries claiming his tendency to forget names and make contradictory statements was the result dementia			0
now researchers at the @entity21 believe @entity3 was suffering from the early onset of @entity1 's while acting as president			1
they came to the conclusion after comparing transcripts of 46 news conferences that @entity3 held to the 101 sessions @entity60 held in his term			1
' key word counts previously associated with cognitive decline in alzheimer 's disease were extracted and regression analyses were conducted , ' the authors wrote			0
@entity3 used words such as ' thing ' as a trigger to recall the correct words more often @entity60			1
he also used more repetition			0
the team used a new algorithm based on a technique used by others to analyse changes in writing by novelists , according to a report in the @entity80			0
' president @entity3 showed a significant reduction in the number of unique words over time and a significant increase in conversational fillers and non-specific nouns over time , ' the researchers said			1
' there was no significant trend in these features for president @entity60 , ' they added			1
the findings , published in the @entity93 , do not conclusively prove that @entity3 had dementia that affected his judgment as president			1
the researchers came to the conclusion after comparing transcripts of 46 news conferences that @entity3 ( right ) held to the 101 sessions @entity60 ( left ) held in his term			1
@entity3 used words such as ' thing ' as a trigger to recall the correct words more often @entity60			1
he also used more repetition but the scientists involved in the project hope the technique will help reveal signs of @entity1 's and other neurological diseases much earlier			1

the telltale signs of @entity1 ’s can be seen in people as young as 20 , research shows			2
the ‘ unprecedented ’ finding suggests that the disease starts to eat away at the brain half a century before symptoms develop			0
this is a ‘ much younger age than the scientists ever imagined ’			0
the discovery raises the prospect of giving people drugs in the very earliest stages , when it is easiest to treat , and even stopping the disease in its tracks			0
however , @entity145 experts cautioned that the research is still at an early stage			0
crucially , it is n’t known how many people who have the early signs of @entity1 ’s in their brains in their 20s will go on to develop the disease			1
@entity1 ’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 @entity145 and , worldwide , the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050 as the population ages			2
he says he saw those signs again in 1986 where he claimed his father could not remember the names of the familiar @entity24 canyons he was flying over			0
while some people suggest they knew @entity3 had the disease while in office , his four @entity164 doctors said they saw no evidence of it			2
@entity1 's is an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells			1
mr @entity3 informed the nation in a hand written letter when he was formally diagnosed			2
' had the diagnosis been made in , say , 1987 , would he have stepped down ? ' , @entity36 asks in the book			0
' i believe he would have '			0
