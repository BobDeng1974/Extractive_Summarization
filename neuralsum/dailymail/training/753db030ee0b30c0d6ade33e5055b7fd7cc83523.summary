by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 01:44 est , 8 june 2012 thousands of commuters had their journeys thrown into chaos after blundering workmen flooded a @entity6 line with two million litres of water as they tried to fix a leaking pipe			1
hundreds of passengers were stranded for up to two hours yesterday , before having to escape along the tracks			1
the chaos continued this morning , with the @entity13 part - suspended and engineers desperately battling to reopen it for the evening rush hour			1
nightmare scenario : passengers became stranded in a tunnel after tracks were flooded with two million litres of water ordeal : staff help a woman off the train after it became stuck in a tunnel when the tracks flooded one of @entity6 ’s biggest safety scares ever was caused by @entity30 engineers			1
a senior @entity6 source said : ' we are usually to blame when things go wrong but this time we can put hand on heart and say , " it was n’t our fault guv "			1
it was 100 per cent down to @entity30			1
' this has caused one of the biggest safety scares ever			1
there was so much water pumping in that there were genuine concerns of a tunnel collapse or the water flooding along the tunnel and affecting other lines			1
' the crisis happened between @entity51 and @entity53 stations at 1.39pm yesterday as workmen were lifting a 24in main to try to plug a smaller leak			1
but the above - ground pipe cracked , sending 440,000 gallons of pressurised water pouring down a ventilation shaft near @entity60			2
today the beleaguered utility firm , which has frequently attracted @entity63 ’s anger for its ' pointless ' and badly co-ordinated road - works , admitted responsibility for a ' tricky ' operation going badly wrong			2
a spokesman said : ' the pipe was encased in concrete and as the crew was working it broke			2
' water from the burst caused signals to short - circuit and bring @entity13 trains to a halt			2
flood on the tracks : passengers are helped from the tube tracks at @entity51 , east @entity80 after they were stranded on a @entity13 train @entity30 , which boasts of its role as a supplier to the @entity84 this summer , now faces a multimillion - pound compensation bill after cars in streets and a housing estate near the @entity89 were flooded			1
@entity63 will also expect compensation after services this morning were suspended between @entity92 and @entity51 , causing massive overcrowding during the rush hour			2
@entity6 ’s chief operating officer @entity95 said the crisis was a ' nightmare scenario ' for the @entity98 , with just 50 days until the opening ceremony			1
he said : ' as the person responsible for operational readiness , this is obviously something i do not want to happen during the time of the @entity98			2
' one engineer told the @entity106 that water was flowing ' like @entity108 ' onto the dual carriageway leading to the @entity110			2
' i have never seen anything like it before , ' he said			0
' it was a massive incident			0
there was a river in the street			0
' cars parked in @entity60 were flooded up to their bonnets , while a housing estate that has been earmarked for an anti-terrorist missile system was also affected			0
relief : passengers including young children are glad to see daylight after being trapped in a tunnel resident @entity126 , 43 , said : ' the gym , swimming pool and car park were closed due to flooding			1
' tube passenger @entity132 , 27 , who was travelling from @entity133 to @entity92 , said : ' i spent four hours trying to get home			1
i felt suicidal , quite frankly			0
i ca n’t imagine what it ’s going to be like during the @entity98			0
' @entity138 , 38 — stranded at @entity139 as she tried to get home to @entity141 — said : ' if this is what happens when something goes wrong on a quiet day , then good luck during the @entity98			0
' the central line is one of two principal tube routes for the @entity98 , with the @entity149 , connecting @entity80 ’s heart directly with the @entity51 stadium			0
yesterday the jubilee and @entity154 lines each suffered two breakdowns , with the jubilee suspended through central @entity80			0
two broken - down trains caused @entity159 line delays			0
@entity30 , which has been heavily criticised for causing roads gridlock with its lengthy repairs , said : ' we were doing exploratory work on the pipe in @entity60 yesterday having identified it as a potential weak point on the network ahead of the @entity98			0
' this is a 24 - inch pipe which is more than 100 years old and when we dug down to investigate a suspected leak , the earth around the pipe moved causing it to burst			0
' this has highlighted how weak the pipe was and the potential for it to burst at any time , so we are glad we can now get it replaced before the @entity98			0
we 're really sorry for the disruption that has been caused			0
