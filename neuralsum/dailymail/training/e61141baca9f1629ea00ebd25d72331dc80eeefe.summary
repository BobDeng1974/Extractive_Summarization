this silence enables the observatory to detect energy in outer space that is equivalent to the energy emitted by a single snowflake hitting the ground			1
while scientists listen intently for clues from the universe on its structure and origins , residents in some of the timeworn railroad towns in this valley maintain a fundamentally tech-less lifestyle that for most @entity69 is a memory			1

the zone does not ban all radio transmissions - for example police , ambulance and fire department radios are used there			0
