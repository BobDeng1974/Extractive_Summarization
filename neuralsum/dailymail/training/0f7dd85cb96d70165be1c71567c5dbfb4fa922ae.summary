a millionaire who built a 10,000sq ft leisure centre in his garden for his family with a 16 - seat cinema , squash court , casino , bar and bowling alley has been told he must pull it down			1
@entity10 , 62 , spent more than a year constructing what is described as @entity13 's most ' elaborate play pad ' but has been involved in a row with his local council after he told them : ' as far as i am concerned , i do n't need planning permission '			1
the leisure - centre style complex also features a 25ft tall , three - storey doll 's house , a soft play area and indoor tennis and badminton courts , and was dug down 18ft into the ground to avoid obstructing neighbours ' views of the @entity29 countryside			1
legal battle : millionaire accountant @entity10 , 62 , has been told he must pull down a leisure centre , which includes a bowling alley , built for his family in his garden struggle : mr @entity10 said the structure , pictured , did not require planning permission but the local council disagree and want it demolished but planners from @entity39 say the luxury extension at the back of his six - bedroom home in @entity43 , @entity29 , must be demolished			1
today mr @entity10 has been given two years to destroy the structure after failing in his appeal against an enforcement notice			1
the planning inspectorate ruled that the building is a ' bulky structure ' and ' totally out of scale and proportion with the surrounding development			1
' he declined to comment today but when he launched his appeal he insisted he had meticulously followed planning laws to avoid intruding on neighbours			1
mr @entity10 , who runs an accountants based in @entity58 , @entity29 , said : ' as far as i am concerned , i do n't need planning permission as i have permitted development rights and i had this designed to take advantage of those rights , so i am within the law and i still consider that to be the case			1
' this is for my family			0
i have three children and five grandchildren ; i love them to bits and they come to my home on a regular basis			2
i have lived here for 32 years			2
' grand : the 10,000sq ft structure was branded @entity13 's most ' elaborate play pad ' and contains a casino for family and friends to use argument : the 62 - year - old said the centre was not bothering anyone and that he had built it for his grandchildren			1
he is pictured in the 16 - seat cinema grand : table tennis , badminton and tennis are among the activities mr @entity10 had in mind when building the impressive structure for his family mr @entity10 , 62 , has maintained that he did not think he needed permission when he started construction			1
' this is my family home , ' he said			0
' all my children and my grandchildren come to visit , it 's the place they all go			2
' if all this fuss had n't been kicked up nobody would know it was there			2
' i have spoken to all my neighbours and none are bothered			0
they have all written letters of support to the council			1
' but not all neighbours were happy with the development			0
@entity117 , 59 , whose house is immediately next door to the bowling alley part of the extension , was the only one to lodge a formal objection with the council			1
he said the decision to tear it down was ' brilliant '			0
' it should come down and go back to a garden , ' he said			2
' but why did the council allow it to be built in the first place ? people told them			1
' i do n't think he will take it down			2
he is going to build a house in front of it , which he has planning permission for , so how will they be able to get back there and take it down ? ' angry : @entity142 , 59 , said : ' it should come down and go back to a garden			1
why did the council allow it to be built ? ' triumph : mr @entity117 , whose house is next to the bowling alley part of the extension , said the decision to tear it down was ' brilliant ' modern : a state - of - the - art gym has also been installed in the complex in the complex which has taken almost a year to complete since breaking ground the soft play area for his five grandchildren as it was being built over the past year			1
mr @entity10 spent months working on the property and maintains it is all unfair ' fuss ' fun house : as well as a cinema room , the accountant built a games room with plush leather sofas , a table - football game and chess boards these include , but are not limited to : a five - metre tall wall stands about a metre and a half from the side of mr @entity117 's house , where he has lived for seven years			1
the plumber added : ' when my neighbour started the project he told me it was not going to exceed 2.5 metres in height			2
' he erected the steel and came and stood by me and looked up and said " that does exceed 2.5 metres does n't it ? "			2
' today two men appeared and went to work on a back wall			0
the brickie said he has two more weeks ' work to do			0
' mr @entity117 told the council he was unhappy about the clatter of the pins in the bowling alley			1
' at night , it is one of the quietest places you could live , ' he said			0
' but the other night he had a practice with his skittle alley and it sounded like it was in my house			2
' mr @entity10 – who refuses to disclose how much the development has cost – said he wanted his family to be able to watch a movie , play roulette and go bowling without leaving home			1
' if you look at the building from the street you ca n't see it at all , ' he said			0
' you can maybe just see a fence			0
you 'd have to be in a helicopter to see it			0
' i looked at the rules permitting development before i started			0
they are very generous rules			0
there are five steps that must be adhered to , and this qualified in all of those			0
i built it to take advantage of all those things			0
' mr @entity10 has purchased the bungalow next door and is planning more works on his land			1
the enforcement notice issued by @entity39 states : ' the construction of walls and the erection of a building on the area of land which has been excavated is harmful to the residential amenity of the surrounding land in terms of the overbearing impact of a physical structure and the level of impact from the uncontrolled use of the building			1
' construction : mr @entity10 dug out 9,000 tonnes of soil from his back garden to make room for the building and maintains that it is not imposing to neighbours complaint : only one neighbour complained because he was unhappy with the height of the complex – and the clatter of the pins in the bowling alley one neighbour , who did not want to be named , said : ' i 've got no issue with him and get on really well with him			1
' to be fair , the lorries have been a bloody nightmare - the traffic and whatever			0
i can see why the people living immediately next door have got major issues			0
people think that maybe he thinks he can possibly do what he wants , but i 'm not going to slaughter him			0
' i do n't know if it 's jealousy - i do n't know			2
people were signing a petition to get it taken down			0
' a neighbour the other day said to me ' has he got his comeuppance ' but he works hard - he 's up at 5am and not done till five or six at night			0
' i just ca n't see him knocking it down			0
is he going to pay the same men to take it down as put it up ? '			0
