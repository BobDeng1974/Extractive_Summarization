back in the day : @entity0 , shown above in character as @entity18 , one of network tv 's first gay characters he told the audience : ' it was very difficult at the time - @entity62 was really the first recurring [ gay ] character on network television and it was a different time , it was 1977			1
' so , yeah , it was awkward			0
' ' i did it in front of a live audience and there were times when i would say to @entity53 , " i love you , " and the audience would laugh nervously			2
' i wanted to stop the taping and go , " what is your problem ? " ' however , @entity0 later rowed back on his comments and said : ' maybe i should n't have said anything today '			1
@entity85 : @entity0 criticized the scenes , such as this one from @entity88 's @entity87 ' do n't want to see that ' : @entity0 did not initially name shows , but @entity88 's @entity91 , above , has been noted for its many explicit scenes in a discussion reported in a blog on @entity95 , @entity0 first blasted the today 's culture of taking offense , then expressed his regret over speaking out at all			1
he said : ' we live in a very scary time in many ways			0
you ca n’t say this , you ca n’t say that , you ca n’t offend this group , that group			2
' people come up to you and ask if you were offended			0
i do n’t understand that			0
i understand it why everyone is watching out for the other person			0
that ’s offensive to me			0
' he also said that his comments apply to heterosexual sex scenes as well as gay ones			2
