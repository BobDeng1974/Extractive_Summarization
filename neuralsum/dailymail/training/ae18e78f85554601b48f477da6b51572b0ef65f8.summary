by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 12 october 2013 updated : 16:02 est , 12 october 2013 as you watch the drunken antics of eligible new @entity4 character sir @entity3 on your screens tonight , spare a thought for @entity7 , the actor who plays him			1
this time last year , during his star turn in the @entity11 production of @entity12 , newly married and just back from an @entity14 honeymoon , he was struck down with a parasitic infection that doctors failed to diagnose for almost five months			1
some rare @entity14 disease perhaps ? in fact , @entity7 had an incredibly common bacterial infection : toxoplasmosis			1
fully fit : @entity7 as sir @entity3 in @entity4 suffered a parasitic infection which doctors were unable to diagnose for five months many will have heard about it in the context of pregnant women			1
the bacteria , toxoplasma , that causes the disease hides in cat faeces and uncooked meat , and can attack the developing foetus			2
expectant women are advised to avoid changing cat litter and eating rare meat			2
a @entity38 report , published in 2012 , suggests that 350,000 people become infected every year in the @entity40			2
only one in five of those feels ill. @entity43 symptoms appear , they are similar to a those of a viral infection such as flu or glandular fever – swollen lymph nodes in the neck and groin , fever , aching muscles and weakness			2
when @entity7 , 31 , became unwell he had no idea what was wrong			1
‘ i had been in @entity12 for 11 months , doing eight shows a week , ’ said the actor – who last week was reported to be @entity59 ’s first crush after they appeared together in a school production of @entity62			1
@entity7 took a break to get married and then went away for a three - week honeymoon			1
when he and his artist wife @entity66 , 30 , returned , he began to feel tired and lethargic with a sore throat			2
big balls : @entity7 's lymphs swelled up to the size of golfballs when he contracted toxoplasmosis he thought he was just run @entity73 over the following week strange lumps appeared on his neck			1
‘ one night , just before we went on stage , my co-star , @entity76 , gasped with horror , “ what on earth is on your neck ? ” ’ his lymph glands had grown to the size of golf balls			2
‘ i felt like @entity88 , ’ he says			2
‘ the whole cast gathered around to look at me			2
’ his production company immediately sent him to a @entity92 doctor			2
‘ he thought it was viral , ’ says @entity7			1
‘ i was given a laryngoscopy – where a camera looks at the back of the throat – and sent home to recuperate			0
’ but his health continued to deteriorate			0
he was exhausted and was signed off work for two weeks			0
after a fortnight , @entity7 ’s puzzled gp referred him to @entity104 in @entity105 – but they were equally perplexed			1
professor @entity106 , head of the @entity107 in @entity108 , explained why the infection can be difficult to diagnose			1
‘ @entity110 is a single - celled microscopic parasite ingested via the mouth			0
once in the body it enters the bloodstream via the gut			0
this is the point at which the immune system kicks in and we feel ill. ‘ most people do n’t notice they have it , but if symptoms appear they are similar to a viral infection and the immune system reacts and suppresses it , usually within four weeks			0
’ the parasite is easy to ingest , but the way it survives is quite unsavoury			0
‘ @entity110 is only able to procreate within the gut of a cat , ’ says prof @entity106			0
‘ the resulting eggs – called oocysts – exit the cat ’s body in faeces			0
these can survive for a year or more , often in or around the soil where cats choose to defecate			0
’ humans may ingest it by touching soil then putting fingers in their mouths			0
it can also be caught by eating undercooked meat from an animal that has eaten oocysts			0
it can not be passed from person to person			0
‘ because of the lack of symptoms , doctors rarely come across toxoplasmosis , ’ says dr @entity148 , consultant microbiologist at @entity149			1
‘ most people do n’t even go to their doctor			0
’ after three months @entity7 was referred to a @entity157 health centre with a tropical disease unit			1
he was screened for various infections , and one of the blood tests showed toxoplasmosis			1
‘ it was a huge relief to have a diagnosis , ’ he says			0
‘ after months of uncertainty , i was told that i ’d recover all by myself and just to go home			1
’ it is not known why some people have the kind of extreme symptoms @entity7 experienced			1
‘ it could be because he ingested more of the oocysts , ’ suggests prof @entity106			0
although he is now fine , the toxoplasma will remain in his body for the rest of his life and could be reactivated should his immune system be compromised			0
some think the existence of the parasite in the central nervous system may cause subtle behavioural and personality changes			0
a study published last month even suggested that infected mice lose their fear of cats – meaning that cats consume the mice and the parasite is able to continue its cycle			0
@entity7 now glows with health , however – all 6ft 3in of him – and has put his nightmare behind him			1
‘ at least i was better by the time we started filming @entity4 , ’ he says .			1
