despite strong winds across the @entity7 thousands of @entity8 staged their own homemade displays on saturday and sunday			2
and these snaps - taken from the shard - show how celebrations spread across the capital			1
visitors to the landmark 's 800ft high viewing platform had an unparalleled view of the night sky as it exploded with colours			1
@entity27 is in the foreground three separate explosions occur simultaneously - even though they are miles apart a series of photos taken from the popular visitor attraction on the iconic building 's 72nd floor - ' @entity35 from @entity25 ' - show displays across the city			1
in one shot three separate explosions occur simultaneously - even though they are miles apart			2
and in another snap one rocket seems to burst just metres away from the former @entity27			0
spectator @entity40 , 35 , who witnessed saturday 's display , said it was a ' magical ' experience			1
he said : ' it 's definitely a big difference watching the fireworks from all the way up there - it beats standing in a boggy field getting battered by wind and rain			2
' adults tickets to @entity35 from @entity25 cost £ 29.95 when bought on the day of entry , or less if booked in advance			1
meanwhile , the @entity7 's most expensive firework , the ' @entity55 ' , is on sale in @entity57 , @entity58			2
with a sizzling price tag of £ 159.00 for the single cake , it will light up the smiles on the faces of the people around you as it soars 25 metres up into the night sky above and explodes into a sea of 107 coloured shots			1
guests enjoy firework displays over @entity3 from 800ft above ground in @entity35 from @entity25 , the visitor attraction at the top of @entity75 's tallest building boom ! the series of photos were taken from the popular visitor attraction on the iconic building 's 72nd floor - ' @entity35 from @entity25 ' great view : despite strong winds across the @entity7 thousands of @entity8 staged their own homemade displays on saturday and sunday spectator @entity40 , 35 , who witnessed saturday 's display , said it was a ' magical ' experience the @entity87 is bathed in light as lasers and lights are tested ahead of its official opening @entity92 , owner of the @entity93 , said : ' we get people coming into the shop and asking for our biggest firework			1
it looks impressive for them to roll up at a bonfire party with a huge firework that 's roughly the size of a bedside cabinet ! ' after lighting the @entity55 firework , you can stand back and enjoy as it is a full display in a box so you 're not lighting lots of different fireworks			1
' it creates a fan effect , which fills the sky from left to right , so what you tend to find generally people will buy this sort of product for either a finale piece to finish off their display with a big ending			1
' @entity55 is a single ignition firework manufactured by @entity121 pyrotechnics - one of the largest manufacturer of fireworks in the world			0
it is the first year that the eagerly awaited banger has been available , and it only arrived in the @entity7 last week , after a ban on the production and movement of fireworks in @entity131 was lifted			0
while fireworks are normally imported between july and september in preparation for bonfire night , the @entity131 government this year put a total stop on the production and movement of fireworks for four weeks due to high temperatures in the country , which could have caused explosions			1
the ban was lifted at the end of august in the area of @entity145 , which is where most of the @entity7 fireworks are manufactured			0
this had a knock on effect to the @entity7 market this year - either orders were n't completed or they missed their chance on the container ships			0
@entity92 ( pictured ) , of @entity57 , @entity58 , who is stocking the @entity7 's most expensive firework cake ' @entity155 ' going off with a bang : the @entity7 's most expensive firework ' @entity155 ' exploding mr @entity92 , 43 , said : ' it takes approximately six weeks for the fireworks to be shipped from @entity131 to the @entity7			2
the knock on effect here in the @entity7 was very worrying for the firework companies and retailers , not knowing if the products were going to come in on time - this left the seasonal sellers and pop - up shops scrambling for whatever stock they could get their hands on , if any at all			0
' so , this year the general public will see less of the pop - up shops			0
' mr @entity92 , a self - confessed ' pyro - anorak ' , is looking forward to seeing the @entity55 firework light up the skies across the country this week			0
he said : ' the biggest smile on my face is when i look around the skies of @entity57 on november 5 , and see the fireworks i have sold and my children shout out the name of the firework			0
it 's wonderful ! ' my passion for fireworks started at an early age and every year i could n't wait for my local shop to start selling fireworks in the run up to bonfire night			2
' i would gaze at the wonderful coloured boxes wondering what these little boxes of gems would unleash			0
thinking of those times brings back the smell of sulphur in the air ! ' over the years , i became increasingly disappointed with the standard of fireworks i bought from the supermarkets and local pop - up shops , so i decided to do something about it and start my own business			0
' fireworks are safe if used correctly and if the general public just follow the fireworks code and read the instructions on the fireworks using the safe distances labelled on the firework			0
