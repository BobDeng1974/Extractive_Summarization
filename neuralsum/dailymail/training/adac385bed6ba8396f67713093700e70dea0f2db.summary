by @entity0 published : 13:10 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 7 november 2013 @entity1 said the rest of the continent looked to the @entity4 to set an example on human rights ¿ calling it the ' best pupil in the class ' - so it must let convicts have the vote @entity4 is the ‘ best pupil in class ’ for obeying edicts from @entity15 , a senior eurocrat declared today			1
@entity1 , @entity17 , said the rest of the continent looked to the @entity4 to set an example on human rights – so it must let convicts have the vote			1
his comments sparked fury among mps who accused him of talking ‘ patronising drivel ’			1
they said that , given @entity4 had such a long track record of implementing judgments by the @entity31 , judges should realise they had made a major mistake by ruling it was unlawful to deny prisoners the vote			1
@entity4 is locked in a stand - off with @entity15 over the ruling			2
at a @entity42 hearing , @entity40 mp @entity39 asked mr @entity1 if it was the ‘ judicial activism ’ of @entity15 that was the problem , rather than @entity4 ‘ sliding into becoming an abuser of human rights ’			1
mr @entity1 replied : ‘ you [ @entity4 ] are the best pupil in the class			1
’ but he claimed that , if the @entity4 did not obey the diktat on prisoner , votes , it would set a bad example to countries such as @entity54			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ for millions of people out there in @entity58 this court is protecting their rights			1
this court is very popular ’			2
he said it would be impossible for the @entity4 to leave the convention on human rights and remain a member of the council			2
and he warned that @entity4 's international influence would be diminished if it decided to go for the ' nuclear possibility ' of not complying with the ruling			2
mr @entity1 , whose council oversees the @entity31 , said : ‘ the implications for the @entity72 would be that other countries will start to do the same and it will be the beginning of the weakening of the whole convention system , ' he said			1
rebuttal : conservative mp @entity78 called mr @entity1 's comments : ' yet more patronising drivel from the @entity81 ' ' if one says that we can pick and choose the judgments that we want to execute , then others will say exactly the same and then this convention will be another convention , for instance like they have in the @entity87			1
‘ they are very weak			0
they are there but there is no enforcement of the standards			0
‘ if you start to pick and choose the judgments from the court of course the court will be weakened and in the end have no meaning			0
’ mr @entity1 added : ' the impact for @entity4 as i see it would be negative			1
it would harm @entity4 reputation and influence in @entity58 and in the world			1
' can you imagine what would happen if the @entity4 as the founding father of this institution is to leave it ? ’ - home secretary @entity110 blamed the @entity31 in @entity15 for the @entity4 's inability to send the radical @entity113 cleric @entity112 to @entity114 for trial			2
@entity117 's legal team used legislation guaranteeing the right to a fair trial			0
- police have secretly removed dozens of convicted sex offenders , including paedophiles and rapists , from the @entity125 ’ @entity126			0
following a human rights ruling , the law was changed last year to allow sex attackers to claim they no longer posed a threat and apply to be taken off the register			0
since then , 43 applications have been approved behind closed doors , at the rate of one every five days			0
- the use of @entity136 of the @entity137 , which enshrines the right to a family life , has prevented two foreign rioters jailed for their part in @entity143 's civil unrest two years ago from being deported			0
government anger over the use of @entity145 prompted the home secretary to draft new laws to stop foreign criminals avoiding deportation			0
ministers believe judges will be unable to ignore the new legislation , as they appear to have ignored rules introduced last july that they should only allow the use of @entity145 in ' exceptional circumstances '			0
@entity40 mp @entity78 hit back : ‘ this is yet more patronising drivel from the @entity81			1
the idea we should sacrifice democracy at home to promote the @entity58 agenda abroad is a faustian bargain @entity42 should reject			2
' the eurocrat made his comments in evidence to a parliamentary committee considering how to break the deadlock between the @entity4 and @entity15			2
the committee has been asked to consider three options for a draft bill - giving the vote to convicted prisoners serving up to six months , giving it to those serving up to four years or keeping the existing blanket ban			0
almost 2,300 prisoners have lodged compensation claims over the denial of their ‘ human right ’ to vote			0
legal experts have estimated each inmate could receive as much as £ 5,000 depending on how many elections they missed while behind bars			0
that could leave ministers with a bill topping £ 11million if all the claims are upheld .			0

@entity189 official said @entity4 long *history* of obeying @entity31
@entity1 said @entity4 must set example to @entity58 on prisoner votes
@entity40 mp calls comments ' patronising drivel '
