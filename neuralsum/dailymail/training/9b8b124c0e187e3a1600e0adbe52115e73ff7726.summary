there an x-ray revealed the greedy doberman had swallowed not one but three golf balls			2
and two of them had moved from his stomach into his small intestine where they were in danger of rupturing his small intestine , which could kill him			0
@entity20 , right , discovered that @entity4 's doberman @entity5 had eaten three golf balls no wonder he was feeling ill ! the vet says she was astonished to see three golf balls showing up on @entity5 's x-ray @entity5 was also at risk of developing peritonitis , a potentially fatal inflammation of the abdomen 's lining			1
@entity31 vet @entity30 said : ' @entity5 was very poorly when he was admitted but there was nothing obvious to determine what was causing his illness			2
' we put @entity5 on a drip and took some x-rays of his abdomen , and when i saw the x-ray i could not believe it : not just one golf ball , but three			2
i do n't know how he managed to do it			0
' the wall of the intestine was severely bruised and , due to the position of the obstruction , @entity5 's surgery was a big risk but it was our only option			1
' we had to tell @entity4 that it was touch and go whether he would even survive the operation			0
' miss @entity4 , 27 , of @entity54 , @entity55 , said : ' the whole family prayed for @entity5 to come through the surgery alive and make a full recovery			1
what 's for tee ? a hungry @entity5 looks unrepentant as he gazes at the golf balls that nearly killed him sorry mum : @entity5 's owner @entity4 says her family prayed he would survive the risky operation ' it was a very worrying time and the kids were really scared as well , as they adore him , ' the mother - of - three said			1
' thankfully everything went well and only a few weeks later he was back to his old self			0
' she said she had no idea where her pet had found the balls			0
' we think it was in a field near us where we let him off his lead during walks but we 're not sure , ' she said .			0
