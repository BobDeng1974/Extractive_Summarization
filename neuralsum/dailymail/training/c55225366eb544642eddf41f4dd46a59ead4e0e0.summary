by @entity0 diseased and dirty meat could end up on @entity4 's dinner plates as a result of new @entity7 legislation , a union has warned			1
@entity4 food inspectors reject millions of carcasses carrying parasites and infections from the food chain every year			1
but @entity13 , which represents government meat inspectors and official vets , has claimed proposed changes to food legislation by @entity18 will water down their ability to check the quality and throw out sub-standard meat			1
more than two million instances of tapeworm ( pictured ) were discovered in red meat by the @entity25 between 2012 and 2014 larvae of parasitic roundworms , like those pictured , can cause milk spot in pigs the changes come just a year after the horsemeat scandal , in which food advertised as beef was found to contain horse meat			1
statistics collected by the @entity25 between 2012 and 2014 recorded more than two million instances of tapeworm being discovered in red meat			1
inspectors also rejected more than 560,000 cases of milk spot - caused by parasitic roundworm larvae - in pigs			2
during that period , they also rejected nearly three million chickens that had been contaminated with faeces during slaughter - which causes the most common form of human food poisoning in the @entity4			2
but the @entity52 has argued it needs to shake up current food legislation			0
there are fears the new rules could see contaminated meat find its way onto @entity4 dinner tables it is now reducing 70 pieces of detailed regulation into a more simplified framework that will ' reduce the burden on business ' and ' improve consumer protection '			1
rules on inspections of pig carcasses have already been changed			0
officials have until now cut into pig heads to check that the animals were not carrying hidden disease and abscesses , but new regulations from june replace it with a visual inspection			2
currently , all chicken carcasses are checked after slaughter by official inspectors or vets in factories , but the @entity83 has recommended this requirement be abolished			0
@entity13 has accused the @entity4 government of lobbying @entity18 for deregulation in order to reduce industry costs			0
millions of carcasses carrying parasites are rejected by @entity4 food inspectors every year a spokesman for @entity13 told @entity93 : ' the @entity4 government â€™s agenda will result in food that repulses us being dished up on our plates			1
' most people do not know that there are a small group of meat inspectors and vets that keep them safe from harmful and repulsive additions to our sausages , sunday roasts and beef pies			0
' they work in some of the most awful conditions in blood and animal discharges every day			0
they are always the first to come under attack , not only from the food business operators , but also from our government			0
' the @entity25 has defended the proposals , arguing that factories would still have to produce meat that was fit for human consumption .			0

changes to @entity7 regulations could *weaken* controls on contaminated meat
@entity13 , which represents food inspectors , says *corners* could be cut
