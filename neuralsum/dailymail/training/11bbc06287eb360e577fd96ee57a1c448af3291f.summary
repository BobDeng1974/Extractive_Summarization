in the comment he says the pace of progress in @entity21 is ‘ incredibly fast ’			2
@entity29 is a @entity44 artificial intelligence company based in @entity28			1
it was acquired by @entity45 for £ 400m ( $ 625m ) in january 2014			0
the company says its exact goal is to ‘ solve intelligence ’ , one of its recent achievements being the creation of a neural network that learns how to play video games			2
the team is building algorithms that can learn in an attempt to create artificial intelligence			1
otherwise , though , the goals and methods of the company are not well - known - but it was apparently enough to convince @entity45 to fork out a fairly sizable chunk of cash			0
he continues : ‘ unless you have direct exposure to groups like @entity29 , you have no idea how fast - it is growing a pace close to exponential			1

‘ i am not alone in thinking we should be worried			0

‘ with artificial intelligence we ’re summoning the demon			2
you know those stories where there ’s the guy with the pentagram , and the holy water , and … he ’s sure he can control the demon ? does n’t work out			0
