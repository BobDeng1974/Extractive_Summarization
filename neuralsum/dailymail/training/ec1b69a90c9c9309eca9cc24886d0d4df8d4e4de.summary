by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 10:45 am on 15th july 2011 resigned : @entity1 , pictured here on tuesday , sensationally strood down as @entity4 chief executive this morning @entity1 this morning sensationally resigned as chief executive of @entity4 , it was revealed			1
in an internal email to staff she announced she was standing down to avoid distracting attention from @entity4 's efforts to ' fix the problems of the past '			1
in a statement the 43 - year - old said : ' i feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt			0
' i now need to concentrate on correcting the distortions and rebutting the allegations about my record as a journalist			0
' pressure was mounting on her to quit after the second biggest shareholder at @entity26 said she ' must go '			1
even prime minister @entity28 had said in recent days that he would accept mrs @entity1 ' resignation			1
fractures had earlier begun to appear between senior figures at @entity4 over the handling of the phone hacking scandal after @entity35 's daughter apparently launched a four - letter attack and the second biggest shareholder declared that ' she has to go			1
' @entity38 is reported to have told friends that @entity40 had ' f * * * * * the company ' and @entity44 prince @entity45 has made his position clear that she should leave			1
until today 's resignation the @entity48 have said they are standing behind the former @entity51 editor but it appears that her job is becoming more and more untenable as senior figures turning in the company on her			2
@entity38 , 42 , is understood to be furious that her father 's media empire has been thrown into turmoil and from her apparent outburst , revealed in the @entity61 , it appears she holds @entity40 responsible for the handling of the crisis			1
turning tide : prince @entity45 said @entity40 ' must go ' while @entity38 said she had ' f * * * * * the company ' @entity35 , 80 , has been keen to show that he is fully behind the @entity4 chief executive last night playing the crisis down declaring that ' we only made minor mistakes ' over the scandal			1
the media tycoon and his son @entity72 last night agreed to appear at @entity73 to go before mps investigating phone hacking after facing the bizarre prospect of imprisonment in a cell half way up the @entity80 clock tower			0
they prompted fury at @entity83 after initially declining the invitation to give evidence at a powerful @entity87 meeting next week			0
as a near - hysterical mood gripped the @entity87 , there were even suggestions that @entity73 should somehow ' impound ' mr @entity35 ’s private jet to prevent him leaving the country			2
@entity95 's top civil servant yesterday hit back at claims by @entity97 that officials prevented him ordering an inquiry into the phone - hacking scandal			2
cabinet secretary sir @entity101 published secret papers showing mr @entity97 was offered advice on the pros and cons of an inquiry , but never told what to do			0
sir @entity101 was said to be ' incandescent ' with anger after mr @entity97 suggested in the @entity87 that the civil service thwarted his plans to hold an inquiry into the scandal at the @entity51 in the run - up to last year 's general election			2
deputy prime minister @entity116 also poured scorn on mr @entity97 , accusing him of ' rewriting history '			0
on wednesday mr @entity97 insisted his plan for an inquiry was ' opposed ' by the civil service , the police , the @entity119 and a committee of mps which had already investigated the affair			0
sir @entity101 's advice reveals he said there was a risk any bid to hold an inquiry would be successfully challenged in court unless ministers could show there was ' public concern ' and warned targeting the @entity137 ' could be deemed to be politically motivated '			2
but a final decision on an inquiry was left to mr @entity97			0
only last week he was pictured smiling with his arm around @entity40 after an hour - long meeting at his luxury @entity143 flat and when asked what his top priority was , he gestured at @entity40 and said : ' this one '			2
prince @entity45 , who holds seven per cent shares in @entity26 , told @entity148 's @entity147 that @entity40 should quit			1
' for sure she has to go , ' he said ' you bet she has to go			0
' speaking on his luxury yacht , the billionaire - known as the ' @entity154 ' - added : ' we hope that as this things unfolds the truth will come out			0
' it 's very important to me and my company who have been investors in @entity26 for 20 years to get this in order because ethics to me are very important			1
' he added : ' i will not accept to deal with a company that has a lady or a man that has any sliver of doubts on her or his integrity			0
' turning to the hacking of @entity176 's phone , he said he wanted to differentiate between the @entity51 and the corporation as a whole			0
remarking on allegations that @entity180 had known about illegal activity he said : ' i think we have to wait for the commission that 's been appointed by the prime minister and look at the results			1
' he also urged the @entity48 to co-operate with the investigation			0
however @entity187 , who could lose hundreds of millions if @entity26 's stock market value crashed further , put forward a measured defence of the company saying it should not be ' over-criticised			1
' @entity38 is due to be given a seat on the board of @entity26 next to her brother , @entity72 , chairman of @entity4 , a move that had made @entity196 's future look more uncertain			1
his two offspring will one day inherit their ageing father 's empire and the different approaches to @entity40 raise the question of whether she will be ' frozen out ' amid a growing tide of public anger			1
@entity206 : @entity35 has publicly backed the @entity4 chief executive but other senior figures want are now turning on ms @entity1 commissioner of the @entity211 sir @entity210 , left , did not inform the prime minister that @entity213 had been employed by @entity214 between october 2009 and september 2010 ms @entity38 was a managing director at @entity215 but left in 2000 to pursue her own ventures until recently rejoining @entity26 when it bought her production company , @entity218 , for £ 290m			1
the controversial deal caused uproar among @entity222 shareholders who accused her of using the business as a ' family candy store '			0
yesterday @entity213 , a former executive editor at @entity51 , was arrested and later bailed over phone hacking allegations			0
his alleged involvement in the crisis is a further embarrassment for @entity214 as it turned out the 60 - year - old was paid £ 1,000 - a - day as a consultant between october 2009 and september 2010			0
as a result head of the yard , sir @entity210 , also faces being dragged before mps to explain himself and his relationship with @entity213			0
a former @entity236 police officer has also claimed that @entity51 journalists tried to pay him for phone details of @entity95 9/11 victims devastated : prime minister @entity28 meets with the family of murdered school girl @entity176 to reassure them about the phone hacking investigation both home secretary @entity246 and an angry mr @entity247 have both demanded answer from the @entity249			0
mr @entity210 briefed @entity28 at @entity250 earlier this week but sources at @entity252 said he had made no mention of the @entity213 appointment whatsoever			2
as a mark that @entity40 's prediction last week that ' worse revelations are yet to come ' forms some truth , the @entity255 has now waded in on the scandal saying it has launched its own investigation			1
a source at the bureau said that they were looking into allegations that the phones of september 11 victims were also hacked by @entity26 employees			2
@entity26 's bid to buy the remaining 60 per cent of @entity215 was shelved this week but the company 's second biggest shareholder revealed the plan will ' come back ' .			1

@entity40 says she does *n't* want to distract attention from @entity4 's efforts to ' fix the problems of the past '
@entity279 , chief executive of @entity280 , will be her *replacement*
@entity180 says @entity1 has been ' one of the outstanding editors of her generation '
@entity287 with 7 *%* share of @entity26 said earlier that @entity40 ' must go '
@entity35 says the company only made ' minor mistakes '
