if we must imagine the fiery depths of hell , the mental image ca n't be far from these incredible images by @entity5 of @entity7 's @entity6 , the world 's oldest continuously active lava lake			1
photographer @entity5 , 35 , says he feared his camera would melt from the overwhelming heat of the lava as he captured the daunting scenes of the 150 - ft wide basalt volcano			1
' the view is simply staggering , ' said the 35 - year - old			0
' @entity17 inside the volcano is constantly moving , bubbling and bursting			0
after couple of seconds , my facial skin was so hot , i had to get away			0
' there was even a point where i was afraid my camera was going to melt			0
' found in the badland desert area of the @entity52 in north - eastern @entity7 , @entity6 's famed lava lake formed around 1906 and is one of six in the world			1
the volcano 's name translates in the local @entity59 tribe 's language as ' smoking mountain ' while the pit to its south is known by locals as ' @entity64 to @entity65 ' , an appropriate moniker given the luminous lava spitting lava and searing heat			1
@entity5 said the view is ' staggering ' , as lava inside the volcano is constantly moving , bubbling and bursting @entity6 's name translates as ' smoking mountain ' in the local @entity59 language while the pit to its south is called ' @entity64 to @entity65 ' while locals are n't particularly welcoming to outsiders and the surrounding terrain is far from hospitable , tourists do make the journey to witness the natural phenomenon			1
in 2009 , @entity83 tv show @entity82 on @entity84 went there to record a world first @entity86 laser image of the volcano			2
@entity90 earth scientist dr @entity89 and a team from the @entity83 explored the @entity52 desert , officially known as the hottest place on @entity84			0
' like a true @entity95 , volcanoes provide a unique window into our planet 's interior , ' he later wrote for @entity100			0
' standing at the lip of the lava lake you can see why the locals see this as " @entity106 " , as the incandescent bubbling lava lake hisses like some badly burned porridge cauldron , overturning and occasionally belching molten lava			1
' a visitor mounts his camera on a tripod in a bit to capture the volcano in its full glory while a small group of tourists line the other side the ferocity of the volcano is clear as lava splashes up from a pool that is said to have formed around 1906 having gained his own access to the area , in which five people in a group of scientists and tourists were killed while others were taken as hostages in a 2012 attack claimed by the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) , @entity5 could n't agree more with dr @entity89 's impression			1
' even though the lava is about 25 feet below the edge , sometimes during a burst the lake spits the lava outside the crater , so you have to be careful not to get hit by it , ' he said			2
' what you get hit by quite often though is fumes			0
' the photographer says while it 's vital to avoid contact with lava , obviously , it 's the fumes that can be the worry poor road access means the only way to efficiently get to the crater is via four - wheel - drive over rugged terrain a far less dramatic sight , the lava forms a hard , grey layer when it is given the chance to cool however , the environment gets far worse that what he experienced			1
in september 2005 an eruption killed 250 head of livestock and forced locals in the surrounding area to flee			0
there were further evacuations in august 2007 caused by lava flow , after which two people went missing			2
the most recent eruption came in november 2008 ' this place is something you do n't see every day , ' said @entity5			2
' as a photographer , i get to see amazing places and when you see that people like those photos			2
this is kind of a reward in itself			0
