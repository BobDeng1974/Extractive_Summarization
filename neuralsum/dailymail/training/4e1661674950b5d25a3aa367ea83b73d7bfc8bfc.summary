jailed : dr @entity0 , 80 , faces his final years in prison after he was convicted of 11 sex attacks on six girls he was treating and jailed for 18 years a ‘ cold - blooded and ruthless ’ doctor who sexually assaulted patients as young as 12 at the hospital at the centre of the @entity9 scandal has been jailed for 18 years			1
@entity0 , 80 , was convicted of a string of rapes and indecent assaults on seriously ill patients at @entity15 , where @entity9 abused scores of youngsters at the same time			1
@entity0 , a renowned children ’s doctor who was praised by @entity19 for his charity work , lured a 16 - year - old girl to his home where he raped her in his bedroom			1
other vulnerable teenagers were molested between 1980 and 1988 , often while their unsuspecting parents sat on the other side of a screen at the @entity29 hospital			0
it can now be revealed that @entity0 has enjoyed the lifestyle of a country gentleman for the past decade on an @entity34 pension worth as much as £ 100,000 a year – despite being struck off from the medical register in 1991			1
he was jailed for 18 months in november 1990 after admitting indecently assaulting three girls as young as 12			1
but on his release from @entity38 , he reinvented himself as a wildlife expert and bought a £ 700,000 , four - bedroom home in the picturesque village of @entity42 on the edge of the @entity44 where no one knew of his past			1
there , @entity0 told neighbours he was a distinguished retired hospital consultant who hailed from a family of esteemed doctors descended from aristocracy			1
the twice - married father of two quickly established himself in the community , becoming a member of the golf club and a regular attendee at church			0
abuse : six victims who were being treated at @entity15 in the 1980s fell into the clutches of @entity0 who indecently assaulted and raped girls as young as 12 he insisted on being addressed as ‘ dr ’ in his church and golf club circles , where he said he was descended directly from the @entity66 and claimed to be a world expert on butterflies who advised the @entity70			1
but he remained far from popular in the village , where he was described as ‘ sneery ’ , ‘ pompous ’ and ‘ haughty ’			0
one resident said : ‘ he told us he was related to the @entity74 of @entity75			0
he went up to @entity76 and he said he could see the family likeness in the portraits			0
’ @entity0 claimed to be a wildlife expert , having travelled to @entity80 in 1984 with the @entity81			1
he boasted how he had published a book on @entity84 butterflies and claimed he regularly visited the @entity70 in @entity85 to give advice			0
but when contacted by the @entity88 , the museum said it had never heard of him			0
marriage : @entity0 's wife @entity90 , pictured together last month , has stood by her husband despite the terrible abuse , but was not in court to see him jailed it was n’t until the @entity96 scandal erupted that the true scale of @entity0 ’s offending emerged when new victims came forward			1
but residents in his village had long held suspicions , with one neighbour telling the @entity88 : ‘ i thought he was a dirty old man			0
’ yesterday a judge at @entity106 said @entity0 was a predatory paedophile as she sentenced him for two rapes and nine indecent assaults on six girls between 1980 and 1988			1
judge @entity110 said : ‘ these are the actions that breached , in the most heinous way , what the medical profession stands for			2
this was someone who was cold and calculating			0
‘ it was your conceited arrogance that led to your downfall			0
‘ all the girls were ill at the time			2
they were treated as objects for your sexual gratification			0
’ speaking about the 16 - year - old victim whom he raped in his home , the judge said : ‘ you raped her at a time when she could n’t have been more vulnerable			2
' this court sees a lot of rape cases			2
it is rare to see such cold - blooded and ruthless behaviour as against this girl			2
’ as his victims wept in the public gallery yesterday , @entity0 – who had a picture of @entity137 on the wall of his office – remained stony - faced			2
he betrayed no emotion as he listened to moving victim impact statements from the women , one of whom said she suffered nightmares and another who said she could n’t get @entity0 ’s face ‘ out of her head ’			0
@entity152 , an abuse lawyer at @entity153 which represented two of his victims , said : ‘ the crimes he committed were among the most despicable imaginable			0
' this case raises serious questions about the culture at @entity15 at the time @entity9 and @entity0 were there			1
