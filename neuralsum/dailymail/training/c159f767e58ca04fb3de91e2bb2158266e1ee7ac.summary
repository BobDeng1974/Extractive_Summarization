fire : the drama happened as the @entity9 , like this one , was cruising at 30,000ft over the @entity10 en route from @entity12 , @entity13 to @entity14 with 275 passengers on board			1
( file photo ) it triggered an alarm and other warning systems			0
cabin crew grabbed extinguishers to tackle the blaze and five were emptied over a five minute period before it was brought under control			1
@entity3 said of the emergency : ‘ it took about five minutes to fight the fire			1
‘ it was an electrical fire and they are a little harder to extinguish			2
i believe they used five extinguishers			0
’ the drama was classified as a ‘ serious incident ’ in the official @entity50 ( @entity50 ) submitted by @entity3 to the @entity51 and obtained by the @entity52			1
that report says the incident is subject to an investigation by the @entity56			2
such @entity50 reports have to be submitted after ‘ any incident which endangers or which , if not corrected , would endanger an aircraft , its occupants or any other person			2
’ the fire erupted during an eight and a half hour flight aboard flight @entity3 on a @entity9 jumbo jet from @entity12			1
emergency : the fire was caused by an in - flight entertainment system ( file picture ) the flight left @entity12 at 4.45pm on october 13 out of @entity12 landing 07.25am next day in @entity71			1
but details of the drama have only now emerged			0
the official ‘ @entity50 ’ report refers to a ‘ fire ’ in the passenger cabin and an ‘ electrical smell ’ in the cockpit			2
it logs the fire as a ‘ serious incident ’ adding : ‘ in - flight entertainment system ( @entity83 ) caught fire in cabin			1
’ there were no injuries			0
@entity3 said : ‘ our crew are highly trained to deal with a wide range of incidents			1

’ @entity71 bound : the plane was heading from @entity12 , @entity13 , to @entity14 back in october a @entity3 spokesman insisted : ‘ it is not correct to say there was only two extinguishers remaining after the fire was put out			1
' there was a range of fire fighting equipment remaining to provide adequate cover , should it have been required			0
‘ he added : ‘ ultimately , this was a small fire that was brought under control very quickly by crew			2
the flight continued as normal throughout			0
’ earlier this month frightened passengers on board a @entity3 flight told how they heard their pilot making a mayday distress call 36,000ft above the @entity10 on november 14			1
the captain radioed for help when smoke filled the cockpit of the plane carrying 220 passengers - and accidentally turned on the public address system			0
the @entity137 was flying from @entity14 to @entity138 but had to make an emergency landing at @entity141 ’s @entity140			2
no danger : @entity3 denied suggestions that the plane was on the brink of being forced into an emergency landing after putting on oxygen masks the crew immediately contacted air traffic control			2
they switched on the cabin address system , and the start of their @entity154 call was heard by passengers			0
passengers were told there had been an electrical fault			0
it is believed the smoke was caused by a fan in the cockpit which overheated			0
@entity3 said of that incident : ‘ we flew engineers to @entity140 who inspected the aircraft and it was brought back to @entity14 where it was fixed in the following days , and returned to service			1
’ another @entity137 - on the same route - made an emergency landing at @entity140 five days earlier just an hour into crossing the @entity10			0
again the cause was a burning smell in the cabin - which is understood to have been caused by a faulty oven			0
the @entity175 warned that electrical burning was what killed all 229 people on board a @entity181 flight over the @entity10 in 1998			0
in that case , a fire is thought to have begun in the cockpit and spread to equipment before it could be brought under control .			0

@entity3 said it took cabin crew five minutes to tackle the fire
