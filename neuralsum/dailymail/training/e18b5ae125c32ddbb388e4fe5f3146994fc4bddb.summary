by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 23:25 est , 24 march 2013 updated : 23:25 est , 24 march 2013 it 's been just a few weeks since @entity4 died after being swallowed by a sinkhole in @entity6 , @entity7 but the scares for the town continue			1
another sinkhole emerged saturday evening at the 1400 block of @entity12 between two houses			2
according to @entity16 estimates have this sinkhole measuring approximately 8 feet in width			1
another sinkhole appears in @entity6 , @entity7 just a few weeks after @entity4 was killed after a sinkhole swallowed him while he was sleeping at his home both of the homes on either side of the sinkhole have been evacuated			1
this is now the third sinkhole to emerge in the @entity7 town this month after a sinkhole appeared just days after the one that killed @entity4			1
@entity4 was presumed dead after he was sucked into the 30 - foot - wide , 60 - foot - deep hole late on march 3rd at his home in @entity6 , @entity7			1
three days after that workers began filling the sinkhole with crushed rocks , after authorities conceded they may never find his body			1
these images , which reveal the size of the hole for the first time , came as a second sinkhole appeared just streets away			1
this sinkhole , which is 12 - feet round , three - feet deep around the edge and five - feet deep in the center , opened beneath a fence on monday , straddling two properties			1
but authorities believe it could reach to the neighbours ' homes underground end of the search : officials have given up hope of finding @entity4 alive and filled in the hole beneath his family 's home with crushed rock secured : the sinkhole in @entity6 , @entity7 has now been filled with crushed rocks as authorities admitted they may never find mr @entity4 's body it does not pose an immediate danger , @entity70 spokesman @entity69 said , and it did not cause any injuries or structural damage to the homes around it but buckled the fence			1
families in the neighborhood said they were leaving to stay at hotels and @entity79 , who lives across the street from the sinkhole , said she will have her home inspected for other sinkholes			2
' is it too close for comfort having it across the street ? yeah			0
is my house gon na sink ? yeah it 's very , it 's scary , ' she told @entity16			0
but others were less worried : @entity94 , who owns one of the properties , said she was not concerned about the hole			2
fears : another sinkhole opened up between two homes in @entity6 , @entity7 on monday , just two miles from the one which swallowed @entity4 on thursday nearby : a map shows the distance between the first sinkhole ( on @entity106 ) and the second ( @entity108 ) in @entity6 , @entity7 missing : authorities said they may never recover the body of @entity4 ' for me , no is strange because ... the hole is little , ' she said			1
@entity69 said the latest sinkhole appears to be unrelated to the one that opened last thursday			1
' it is not geologically connected , ' @entity69 said			0
dirt now fills the sinkhole on the @entity6 lot where a home once stood			1
with it being sealed , it has effectively become a tomb for @entity4 , who was killed when the floor opened up last week			1
@entity4 disappeared into the hole that opened up under his bedroom on thursday night in a scene his brother , @entity129 , likened to a horror movie			1
the other occupants of the house , which is owned by the family of @entity129 's fiancee , had been preparing for bed when they heard a loud crash and @entity4 screaming			2
@entity129 ran to help his brother but could only hear his screams			0
firefighters arrived on the scene and pulled @entity129 away from the edge of the chasm			2
on monday , demolition crews returned to @entity4 's home to demolish the rest of the house - revealing the massive hole for the first time - before efforts will begin to stabilize the sinkhole			1
two nearby houses have been evacuated as the sinkhole has weakened the ground , and the residents probably will never be allowed inside again , said @entity154 of @entity155			2
@entity4 , a landscaper who mowed highway medians for a living , had moved into the four - bedroom home only two months ago which he shared with his brother , @entity129 , 36 , and four others			1
the other adults , a two - year - old child and a dog were at the home at the time the sinkhole opened , but were not injured			2
demolition : authorities believe the hole which swallowed @entity4 beneath this home was 60 - ft deep and continue to carry out tests on the ground hidden danger : authorities believe the sinkhole could stretch under neighbours ' homes and they have been evacuated workers recovered a family bible , flag , military medals , a purse , teddy bears and generations of photos from the site			1
on monday they also recovered two antique rifles that were family heirlooms			0
engineers placed listening devices , microphones , ground - penetrating radar and other equipment to test the soil to find whether it was safe to work and to look for any sign of life below			0
they have detected no such sign ever since the hole opened up late on thursday			0
@entity129 said the family was discussing plans for a memorial service and a possible marker at the site			0
' i 'm the only one who tried to get him out , ' he said , while begging county authorities to do more to find his brother 's body when the lot is cleared			0
the property 's owner @entity211 says he want 's nothing to do with the home			0
he says he 'd love a memorial placed there for @entity4 but the whole sequence of events made for a bizarre occurrence			2
sadness : a family member prays in front of home where @entity4 was killed before demolition crews tear it down hope : @entity129 , who tried to save his brother from the sinkhole as he was sucked from his room , prays as he speaks to the media sinkholes in @entity7 are caused by the state 's porous geological bedrock , according to the @entity233			1
as acidic rainwater filters into the ground , it dissolves the rock , causing erosion that can lead to underground caverns , which cause sinkholes when they collapse			0
' there 's hardly a place in @entity7 that 's immune to sinkholes , ' @entity244 , who owns a geology consulting company in the @entity247 area			2
' there 's no way of ever predicting where a sinkhole is going to occur			0
' watch out : @entity7 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , and @entity257 are the states most affected by sinkholes , according to the @entity260 a sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground			1
they mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man - made activities			0
when this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer , spaces and caverns develop underground			0
@entity274 , carbonate rock , and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion			0
meanwhile , the top layer of @entity277 usually stays intact			0
when the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large , the surface suddenly gives way			0
according to the @entity260 , @entity7 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , and @entity257 are the states most affected by sinkholes			2
while they often occur from natural causes , sinkholes can be man - made and caused by human activity			0
groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely culprits			0
they can also occur when water drainage systems are changed			0

now a third sinkhole appears in @entity6 , @entity7 just a few blocks from where @entity4 was killed
latest sinkhole measures approximately 8 ft wide and is in between two homes
the first sinkhole was filled in , *entombing* the body of @entity4 , *37* , who was pulled into the cavity under his home last thursday
days later a second sinkhole , 12 ft , appeared just streets away on monday straddling two properties
