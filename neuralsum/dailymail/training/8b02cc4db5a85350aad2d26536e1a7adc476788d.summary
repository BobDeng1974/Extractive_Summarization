a world - renowned plastic surgeon has invented a bra which supports your breasts while you sleep to stop them dropping over time , dubbed the @entity6			1
according to its creator dr. @entity8 , based in @entity9 , @entity10 , gravity takes its toll on your breasts over years of sleeping supportless , leading to ' flattening and splaying ' of the tissue , as well as ' vertical chest wrinkles ' when we doze on our sides			1
the $ 98 @entity6 's slightly odd appearance is down to its ' sling configuration ' , which cradles each breast individually and keeps them separate to avoid one putting pressure on the other , regardless of sleeping position			1
having taken dr @entity8 's @entity6 bra for a sleepy test drive , i was surprised to find it felt extremely comfortable and looked much sexier than i expected it would			1
it 's far too soon , of course , to tell whether this contraption will compete with gravity on an ongoing basis , but i 'll certainly be wearing it at night from now on , if just for the snugness alone			0
dr @entity8 , who has performed over 2,000 breast surgeries , many of them on unnamed celebrities , claims that when worn every night , the @entity6 can actually prevent the need for a breast lift further down the line			2
' prevention is what the @entity6 does most effectively , ' he says			2
' if you ’re sagging a little , our bra ca n’t tighten tissue that ’s already stretched , but can certainly help prevent it from further stretching and sagging			0
' he adds : ' yet we have had more than a few of anecdotal reports from women stating that their breasts sit higher in the morning after sleeping in a bra			0
' daytime only : conventional bras ( pictured ) use shoulder straps to lift the breast weight and often underwire as re-enforcement , both of which allegedly do ' nothing ' when the wearer is lying down harness - like : the @entity75 , which has no wiring , supports the breasts from every position and has an extra pair of j - hooks so the straps can be adjusted in seven different places to fit the wearer snugly stop the clock : dr @entity8 , who invented the @entity6 ( pictured ) , claims that worn every night , it can actually prevent the need for a breast lift further down the line mr @entity8 first had his eureka moment back in 2008 , when he noticed a pattern in his patients after years of private practice			1
' no matter who the patient is , how old she may be , or even her cup size , those few women who make a habit of sleeping in a bra - for some reason @entity100 actresses top the list here - invariably have a higher , firmer bust - line and smoother , firmer cleavage than those who do n't , ' he says			2
conventional everyday bras use shoulder straps to lift the breast weight and often underwire as re-enforcement , both of which do ' nothing ' when the wearer is lying down , according to dr @entity8			0
his patented system , the result of six years development and more than 47 prototypes , is called @entity118 ( @entity119 ) , and features ' cradle - shaped ' outer wings to support each breast from every angle			1
secret ? dr @entity125 noticed that clients who slept in bras - mostly @entity100 actresses he notes - had higher , firmer bust - lines			0
pictured from left , @entity131 @entity130 , @entity133 @entity132 and @entity135 @entity134 ( right ) coming soon : the @entity6 will launch next month in three designs ; the $ 98 bra ( pictured ) , the $ 120 @entity138 and the $ 120 @entity139 , all available in standard bra sizes in either black , nude or lace over nude the @entity75 also has an extra pair of j - hooks so the straps can be adjusted in seven different places to fit the wearer snugly , and no wiring			1
well qualified : dr @entity8 ( pictured ) has performed over 2,000 breast surgeries ' wiring , which gives larger bras their structure while keeping the bra close to the rib cage , works very well for vertical support from underneath the bosom , that is , for bras worn during the day , ' dr @entity8 explains			2
' at night , unique gravitational forces are imposed upon the breasts which , in turn , require unique kinds of support - lateral and medial - that wiring simply ca n’t provide			0
' plus a lot of women find wiring uncomfortable and comfort was one of our foremost priorities			0
' with comfort in mind , the bra is also crafted from foam and soft microfibers			0
so could the @entity6 be beneficial when worn during the day too ? ' some of our test wearers have made it their " go - to " brassiere during the day as well , ' dr @entity8 remarks			2
and as for wearing a regular bra at night , he says : ' a normal bra at night is better than nothing but it does n't protect the breasts from falling to the sides when lying on your back or side			0
' the @entity6 will launch next month in three designs ; the $ 98 bra , the $ 120 @entity138 and the $ 120 @entity139 , all available in standard bra sizes in either black , nude or lace over nude .			1

the $ 98 @entity6 bra features ' cradle - shaped ' outer wings to support each breast regardless of sleeping position
sleeping without a bra leads to ' splaying ' of the breast tissue and can result in ' vertical chest wrinkles '
