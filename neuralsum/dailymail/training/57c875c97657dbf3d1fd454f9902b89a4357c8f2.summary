@entity2 militants have shot and wounded a senior @entity4 rebel commander inside @entity5 , it has been claimed , raising yet more questions of @entity8 's commitment to defeating the terror group			1
@entity10 , the leader of a group fighting @entity13 in the besieged city of @entity15 , and his 20 - year - old son @entity16 , were ambushed by jihadists in the southeastern @entity5 town of @entity19 on friday afternoon			1
the pair - who had been attending a meeting with @entity5 officials - were snatched from their car in an apparent kidnapping attempt , after the driver of their car allegedly simply switched off the engine when confronted by four heavily armed @entity13 militants at a roadblock			1
after being seized they were driven at high speed towards the @entity4 border and only managed to escape when one of the third - party smugglers @entity13 uses to transport people and weapons into @entity4 bailed on the plan after spotting @entity5 soldiers			1
he and his 20 - year - old son @entity16 , were ambushed by jihadists in the southeastern @entity5 town of @entity19 on friday afternoon militant : the attempted kidnapping raises serious questions about @entity5 's commitment to joining the international effort to destroy the @entity2 terror group in @entity4 and @entity58 none of the @entity2 attackers wore masks and two of them were known to @entity10 from fighting in @entity15 , his aides in the @entity47 rebel group told the @entity66			1
using an alternative acronym for the terror group , spokesman @entity67 said : ' @entity69 blocked the road ahead of them , and four armed men grabbed them from the vehicle			0
' a matching account of the kidnapping was reportedly given to the newspaper by another military commander in the group , @entity78			0
he claimed that @entity10 's driver - who was also his most trusted advisor - had been in on the plot , driving the rebel leader into a quiet back road where the extremist were waiting , refusing to turn the vehicle around when ordered to do so , and turning off the car 's engine rather than trying to escape			1
location : the southeastern @entity5 town of @entity19 - where @entity10 was kidnapped - is approximately 50 miles from the @entity4 border			1
his kidnapping was only aborted when a third - party smuggler helping the militants bailed on the plan when he saw @entity5 soldiers close to the @entity4 border crossing near @entity15 fighting : black smoke is seen rising from an @entity13 - held building inside @entity15 yesterday afternoon hit : a cloud of thick white smoke rises from a building in @entity15 following an airstrike by a @entity107 airplane @entity110 forces defending a besieged @entity4 town against @entity13 fighters received supplies and weapons in an airdrop sunday , @entity107 military officials said			1
the airdrops into @entity15 , on the border of @entity5 , were the first conducted by the @entity107 in @entity4 and followed a series of @entity107 and coalition airstrikes supporting the @entity110			2
the @entity107 stated earlier sunday that it had launched 11 airstrikes overnight in the area of @entity15			0
in a statement sunday night , @entity123 said @entity126 cargo planes made multiple drops of arms and medical supplies that had been provided by @entity110 authorities in @entity58			0
the airdrops were intended to support continued resistance to @entity13 as the @entity134 extremist group attempts to gain control of @entity15			0
the news raises yet more questions about @entity5 's commitment to the international fight against @entity13 , after @entity8 drew a great deal of international criticism for refusing to intervene to help @entity110 fighters battling militants just 200 yards over the border in @entity15			2
there are also serious questions over why @entity5 has allowed thousands of @entity148 jihadists - who enter the country on budget airlines in tourist resorts - to easily pass over the border into @entity4 to join @entity13 fighters there			1
@entity5 has long argued that @entity13 does not have a presence in the country			2
others claim small cells are able to operate in southern @entity5 towns , easily popping over the border to fight in @entity4 before returning home to @entity5			2
there are even claims from those on the ground that wounded @entity13 militants are routinely smuggled from the frontline to receive treatment in @entity5 hospitals , which are better equipped and less - stretched than those in northern @entity4			1
@entity5 has also been accused of allowing up to 3,000 detained @entity148 jihadists to rejoin the @entity2 in @entity4 in return for the release 49 diplomats who had been held prisoner by the terrorists			2
calm : @entity4 @entity110 fighters are seen walking in northern @entity15 this afternoon			0
the photograph was taken from across the border in @entity5 @entity4 refugees now living in @entity5 watch the ongoing fighting over the border in their hometown @entity15 @entity4 refugee children , one flashing the v - sign , peer through the window of a school building that has been serving as a refugee center in the @entity5 border town of @entity189 , @entity5 experts believe @entity5 's reluctance to fully commit to the fight against @entity13 is two-fold			1
firstly the brave @entity110 fighters battling @entity13 in northern @entity4 have links to the @entity195 - a group long - banned in @entity5 amid accusations of terrorism			1
secondly , due to @entity5 sharing borders with both @entity4 and @entity58 , @entity8 is understood to be worried that any move against @entity13 could trigger a wave a car and suicide bombings there - something that would be devastating for the country 's hugely important tourism industry			1
this morning the main @entity4 @entity110 armed group defending @entity15 against an @entity13 offensive said it hopes for more support after the @entity107 air - dropped arms to its fighters for the first time			2
the @entity107 military said on sunday c - 130 aircraft had delivered small arms , ammunition and medical supplies provided by the @entity110 authorities in @entity58			0
' it will have a positive impact on the course of military operations and certainly we are still hoping for more support , ' @entity218 told @entity225 via @entity226			0

@entity232 , who worked for @entity234 's state - owned @entity233 as @entity5 correspondent , died in the city of @entity189 after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a ' heavy vehicle '			0
@entity240 's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested , claiming @entity5 intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested @entity13 militants were being smuggled back and forth over the @entity4 border in the back of aid vehicles			1
tragic : @entity232 , who worked for @entity234 's state - owned @entity233 as @entity5 correspondent , died in the city of @entity189 after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a ' heavy vehicle ' @entity240 , an @entity107 citizen of @entity256 origin , had been working in @entity5 for @entity233 - the @entity234 state - owned television network			0
in a report published on the company 's website , it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of @entity189 in @entity265 when the ' suspicious ' accident took place			0
neither the ' heavy vehicle ' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident , @entity233 claimed , adding that her parents ' refused to believe ' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally			0
@entity233 's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by @entity5 newspaper @entity278 , however , who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as - yet - unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene			0
death : @entity232 's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested , claiming @entity5 intelligence agents had accused her of spying only last friday @entity240 was interviewed on camera by @entity233 about her fears of being arrested by @entity5 intelligence agencies			0
