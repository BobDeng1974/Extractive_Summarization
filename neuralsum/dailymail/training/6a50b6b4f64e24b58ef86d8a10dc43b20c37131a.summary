by @entity0 @entity2 's bid to find a replacement striker for @entity4 suffered a blow when @entity6 failed a medical in @entity8 on sunday			1
the £ 8.5 million move was almost a done deal for the @entity11 forward after he 'd agreed personal terms and the release clause in his contract was activated , but after medical staff 's examination the plug was pulled on the deal			1
now the sizeable boots of @entity4 remain unfilled , @entity19 looks at who else @entity21 could make a play for ahead of the 2014 - 15 season			2
fallen through : @entity6 's move to @entity2 fell at the final hurdle after he did n't come through the medical big shoes to fill : now @entity2 is still without a replacement for @entity30 's @entity4 @entity32 deal collapses @entity33 value : £ 16m injured and out until october but @entity2 have made their interest known , as have @entity36			1
@entity33 have also offered a new five - year contract to the 24 - year - old but will accept the right offer as they have shown			0
a january bid makes more sense			0
in demand : @entity43 will be recovering from a knee injury until october but is wanted by @entity2 and @entity36 , while @entity33 have offered him a five - year contract to stay @entity46 value : £ 21m powerful , retains possession well and scores goals			2
his performance at @entity52 last season impressed observers and @entity2 alike but his wage demands and price tag did not when they made recent enquiries for the 25 - year - old @entity59 striker			2
strong option : @entity61 could be a weapon in @entity52 's arsenal but money could be a barrier to any move @entity67 value : £ 40m ready - made superstar striker to fill @entity4 's shoes but plays further forward and would put pressure on @entity73 's role			1
wages would be around £ 200,000 a week and , if the 26 - year - old leaves @entity67 , he is unsure about @entity2 as a destination			0
location , location : would @entity79 be keen to move from @entity67 to @entity2 ? @entity80 value : £ 18m the 23 - year - old scored 23 goals last season and provides his fair share of assists			1
he has attracted attention from @entity88 , in particular			0
however , if he leaves @entity80 he wants @entity90 football			0
@entity2 like him but he does not top their list			0
stepping up : ambitious @entity80 forward @entity92 ( right ) wants @entity90 football if he moves @entity93 value : £ 15m the 27 - year - old is admired by @entity21 but may not be quite the step up in level @entity2 are now looking for			1
is pacy and can play wide too			0
@entity99 made recent enquiries - as did @entity88 - for the @entity11 who scored 20 goals last season			0
not like for like : @entity93 's @entity104 is admired by @entity21 but is hardly a replacement for @entity4			1

@entity107 fell through when the striker failed the medical
the @entity11 forward travelled to @entity8 to complete £ 8.5m move
@entity2 still need a world class *marksman* to replace @entity4
@entity80 's @entity92 and @entity93 's @entity104 have also been *linked* to @entity21 ' *squad*
