a doctor has made history by having a smear test on live tv in a bid to urge other women not to miss their vital screening appointments			1
dr @entity7 appeared on @entity9 's @entity8 as part of the programme # @entity12 campaign			1
while smear tests save the lives of more than 4,500 women each year , one in three women under 35 refuses to have one , figures show			1
she said : ' when i was first called for a smear i was already at medical school so i knew how important it is			0
' today is about raising awareness			0
' while presenter @entity21 asked about the instruments used to perform a smear test , an oncologist performed the examination on dr @entity7			1
dr @entity7 , said : ' if you 're between 25 and 49 you should have a smear test every three years			1
' after that women should have them every five years until they are 65 , unless they have any abnormalities			0
' it is preferable to go for a test mid-cycle , because bleeding can obscure the cells and can lead to an inadequate result , which means you might have to go back			0
' everybody 's uterus tips either forwards or backwards			0
if yours tips backwards it can be harder to perform a smear test , so i always advise patients to pop their hands under their bottom to tip the pelvis			1
' usually you can expect your results within two to three weeks			0
' viewers were told dr @entity7 ( pictured ) was making ' tv history ' by having the smear test live on air reporting back on her test , she added : ' it feels a bit cold but that 's it , i did n't feel a thing			1
' the campaign comes as the charity @entity78 urged women to learn more about gynaecological cancers as part of the national awareness month			1
a survey carried out by the charity found less than a quarter of 16 to 25 - year - olds said they felt confident they were well informed about gynaecological health issues , compared to more than 42 per cent of women aged 66 to 75			1
the charity is campaigning to raise awareness and help young women face up to embarrassment around the issues , in order to prevent cancer			2
currently in the @entity96 , 55 women are diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer every day			1
the study found more than one in 10 of 16 to 35 - year - olds said they found it very hard to talk to their gp about gynaecological health			2
nearly a third admitted they had avoided going to the doctors altogether about related issues because they were too embarrassed			0
these figures were found to dramatically decrease among women in older age groups			2
@entity109 , chairman of @entity78 said she wanted women to talk openly about gynaecological cancers			0
she said : ‘ at the @entity78 we know how important it is to promote straight talking about the signs and symptoms of gynaecological cancers to women of all ages , and this survey has highlighted just how far we still have to go to make this happen			0
‘ these cancers have some of the worst outcomes for women , with a 40 per cent mortality rate			0
' understanding the symptoms will save lives , which is why we are urging women this @entity127 to talk more openly about these life - saving issues			1
’ the @entity129 offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25 - 64 every three to five years			2
it is not a test for cervical cancer , but it identifies early abnormalities which , if left untreated , could develop into cancer of the cervix ( neck of the womb )			1
a sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis			0
those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and , if necessary , treatment			0
the @entity129 offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged between 25 and 64 every three to five years			2
it involves a doctor inserting a speculum , pictured , into the vagina before using a fine brush to collect cells at the neck of the cervix currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young			1
according to @entity168 statistics , not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009 - 2011			1
the lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the @entity171 on @entity172 ( @entity173 ) advised the @entity129 in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good			2
the committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord , and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children , and could cause significant anxiety			0
many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25 , including @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191			0
in @entity193 , women are invited to be checked from the age of 20 , though it is due to go up to 25 next year			2
in @entity196 women are invited from 18 , @entity197 from 20 , and in the @entity199 two years after women become sexually active			0
meanwhile , other countries start cervical screening later			0
both the @entity202 and @entity203 offer screening to women only once they are 30 , and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in @entity209 , and in @entity211 it is for women over 31 .			1
