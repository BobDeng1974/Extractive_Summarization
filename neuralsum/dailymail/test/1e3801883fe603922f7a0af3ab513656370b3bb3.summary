@entity0 ’s £ 2.3m , 16 - year - old wonderkid @entity1 has been dropped from the club 's b - team @entity2 because results drastically improve when he is not on the pitch			1
@entity1 picked @entity0 over @entity6 and @entity7 at the start of the year but the record - breaking teenager is already experiencing how difficult it can be for young players in the @entity13 capital			2
@entity2 , managed by first - team coach in waiting @entity16 , were top of their regional third division when @entity1 arrived at the club in january , but after he made his debut the team ’s form dipped dramatically and following a run of four straight defeats , they dropped to seventh place , four points off the lead			1
@entity1 , pictured in training with the @entity0 first team , has been dropped by the @entity2 side @entity1 is said to be on a different wavelength to his @entity32 team - mates as he rarely trains with them @entity16 ( with @entity1 behind him , right ) dropped the @entity34 as he looks to secure promotion @entity1 was chased by a host of top @entity38 clubs before he left @entity39 for @entity0			1
the @entity34 youngster visited @entity6 and @entity42 's training grounds , as well as @entity43			0
he is thought to be on wages of around 40,000 - a - week after @entity0 spent £ 2.3million to acquire his services			2
age : 16 ( @entity47 17/12/98 ) born : @entity48 , @entity49 position : attacking midfielder clubs : @entity39 ( 2014 - 15 ) , @entity0 ( 2015 - castilla appearances : 7 @entity32 goals : 1 international appearances : 3 international goals : 0 there have been suggestions that other b - team players resented the fact that @entity1 was training with the first team three times a week and then starting @entity2 games very much on a different wavelength to his team - mates			1
the @entity49 international might be benefiting from training with @entity67 and @entity68 but it was not helping him become a cohesive part of the @entity2 side			1
and they had the perfect chance to prove they were better off without him when he was called up by @entity49 coach , @entity76 , for the recent @entity78 qualifier against @entity79			0
they won the match played in his absence and despite the fact that he was back in @entity0 and available at the weekend @entity16 kept him out of the team and they won again			0
@entity0 are desperate to see their @entity2 side promoted and @entity16 must now decide if @entity1 ’s presence is doing more harm than good			2
the teenager was involved with @entity49 on international duty last week and @entity32 prospered without him if @entity2 fail to go up to the second division then @entity1 will be loaned out next season @entity1 signed for @entity0 in a £ 2.3m deal in january as @entity96 placed his trust in the 16 - year - old the @entity34 ’s future is also tied to whether or not promotion is achieved			1
he was never going to be asked to play another year of @entity13 third division football so if @entity32 fail to go up to the second division he will be loaned out next season			0
no one at @entity0 believes the club has made a huge mistake in signing @entity1 but it was a measure of how they will need to be patient with their precocious young talent when first - team coach @entity96 decided against playing him in the @entity110 against @entity111 despite pressure to pick him			2
@entity1 would have been the youngest player ever to play in the competition			0
with his path to first - team involvement currently blocked and the b team choosing to chase promotion without him he might even be questioning his decision to turn down a clutch of @entity121 clubs in favour of @entity0			0
@entity1 poses with @entity123 ( left ) and @entity67 ( right ) after completing his move in @entity13 the youngster takes part in sprint training with @entity128 winger @entity68 in january @entity1 might even be questioning his decision to turn down @entity121 clubs in favour of @entity0			0

@entity0 signed @entity34 teenager @entity1 for £ 2.3million
@entity1 dropped down to @entity32 with team top of regional third division
results have picked up since the 16 - year - old was dropped from starting xi
@entity1 trains with first team and is not a cohesive part of @entity2 side
no one *regrets* @entity1 signing but he may go out on loan next season
