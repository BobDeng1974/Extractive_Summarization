lord @entity0 , the lord chief justice , said he was ‘ in no doubt ’ access to pornography online encouraged perverts to turn their fantasies into reality extreme online pornography is fuelling rape and murder , the country ’s most senior judge warned yesterday			1
lord @entity0 said vile internet material undoubtedly encouraged sex fiends to turn their fantasies into reality			1
his hard - hitting comments , given in evidence to @entity17 yesterday , add huge weight to the @entity21 ’s @entity20 campaign			1
the lord chief justice specifically referred to the appalling murder of @entity24			1
@entity25 , who was obsessed with violent online images , had convinced the 17 - year - old to pose for him with a rope around her neck for a ‘ fantasy photoshoot ’			1
but he kicked away the box she was standing on , left her hanging and took pictures of her naked after she died			0
the 23 - year - old pervert had been watching extreme pornography immediately before @entity36 arrived at his home			2
lord @entity0 , who threw out @entity25 ’ appeal against his whole life term last year , said the case ‘ left me in no doubt at all that the peddling of pornography on the internet had a dramatic effect on the individual ’			1
he added : ‘ what is available to download and to see is simply horrific and it played a real part in the way in which this particular murder was carried out			0
’ he told the commons justice committee the crime in may 2013 had been influenced – and intensified – by pornography			2
it was hard to believe , he said , that @entity25 could have come up with his sickening plan without first reading about similar fantasies or offences online			1
@entity59 , a barrister and @entity61 mp , said the lord chief justice ’s evidence was significant because judges knew better than almost anyone about the driving forces behind offences			1
he added : ‘ if the impression he has been left with , having dealt with some of the most serious cases , that extreme pornography is influencing some crimes , then i think that is very persuasive			2
’ in october 2012 , @entity74 was jailed for a whole - life term after being found guilty of killing five - year - old @entity74 a year earlier			0
he had searched for images of child abuse and rape			0
and in may 2013 , @entity79 was jailed for murdering 12 - year - old @entity79 after scouring the internet for vile child porn using terms such as ‘ violent forced rape ’ and ‘ incest ’			2
more protection : in a crackdown on digital perverts , the government created a specific offence of communicating sexually with someone under the age of 16 – closing a gaping legal loophole campaigners have repeatedly called for internet service providers to block violent and child pornography			1
and , after the long - running @entity21 campaign to block internet porn , the government gave families the choice of whether to opt in or block online pornography from home networks			1
ministers have also forced internet giants to block searches for around 100,000 terms relating to child abuse			0
last week internet providers @entity108 and @entity110 become the latest firms to place an automatic block on pornographic websites			0
campaigners are putting pressure on @entity116 and @entity117 to follow suit			2
in the @entity25 case , @entity119 was told he had written a horrific story entitled @entity123 in which he outlined how he was going to kill her			0
prosecutors said the ‘ sexual deviant ’ from @entity128 , @entity129 , had a ‘ morbid fascination in pornography depicting violence towards young women ’			0
lord @entity0 , who became head of the judiciary of @entity136 and @entity137 in late 2013 , also raised the prospect of high - profile extradition cases being broadcast live on television			0
a pilot scheme has seen some @entity142 and @entity144 hearings shown to viewers for the first time , he told mps			0
but lord @entity0 said televising criminal sentencing or appeals could inadvertently force victims to re-live harrowing evidence or show details that could encourage other crimes .			0
