by @entity0 children as young as nine are taking and sharing explicit photographs of themselves according to a leading @entity5 cyber safety expert			1
@entity6 , who works alongside the @entity8 police as well as providing training for schools , told @entity11 that the problem is not only extremely common , but that it is not at all new			0
' i have been dealing with this routinely , ' ms @entity6 said of under 18 - year - olds feeling the pressure to take sexualised and naked photographs of themselves			2
' there is n't a secondary school in the country that has n't had to do with teens sending these images and even some primary schools are dealing with it			0
' @entity5 cyber safety expert , @entity6 , revealed that students in both high schools and even primary schools feel pressured to share naked photographs of themselves with their peers her admission comes in the wake of the recent celebrity hacking scandal , in which dozens of women including @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 had their private explicit photographs hacked and shared online			1
however ms @entity40 revealed that she has been addressing the issue with children as young as nine since 2010			0
' one of the saddest things i 've addressed is during sessions in high schools where girls admit they are under pressure to send naked images to boys			0
' we 're not talking about just couple of 17 - year - olds in new relationships , we 're talking about a group of young girls who are believing it 's part of the dating and flirting process			1
we are talking about people under 18 , and this is child pornography			0
' no one should have to do anything			0
it 's not part of the dating ritual , but some young people believe this is what they have to do to get on or get ahead or be popular – to be liked , i have to behave in this way			2
' the admission comes in the wake of the recent celebrity hacking scandal , in which dozens of women including @entity36 and @entity37 had their private explicit photographs hacked and shared online the pressure to provide images has also occurred in more sinister ways , with some teenagers being blackmailed into providing naked photographs			1
ms @entity6 told the @entity85 that a 14 - year - old girl ' sent an image as a joke but then he threatened to release it if she did n't send more so she felt it was better to keep him on side and sent naked photos for about six months , we got on the local police because it was extortion			2
' in 2013 , @entity5 education departments recorded over 940 incidents of students sexually abusing their fellow students , according to the @entity101 , with inconsistent numbers recorded across the states being attributed to dismissals and poor data collection			1
in younger children , the pressures surrounding explicit photographs differed from those experienced by older age groups , however ms @entity6 said the problem was still present			2
' with younger kids they are considered ' fun ' or ' rude ' photos , they 're not really sexual , ' she said			0
in 2013 , @entity5 education departments recorded over 940 incidents of students sexually abusing fellow students , with inconsistent numbers across states being attributed to dismissals and poor data collection ' we know that the onset of puberty is much earlier than it ever was and in grade five and six some children have boyfriends or girlfriends in their own little way			1
i was called into a primary school – a top private one - where i had grade five children sharing nude photos on @entity133			0
' the cyber safety expert said that in an increasingly sexualised world , the approach in dealing with the problem needs to be holistic by including : teaching children web safety and making sure they know the risks associated with the devices they are using , modernising sexual education in high schools so that it addresses relationships and pressures , empowering young people to have a voice and make their own decisions as well as encouraging parents to talk to their children about awkward subjects			1
' now , children are exposed to far more sexually explicit imagery , and certainly the ability to be connected to a sexual side of life was n't there for a young person back in the day – if you take away the hacking scandal , which is crime in itself - youngster after youngster were coming out with sex tapes			1
young people see that and there 's an enormous pressure to want to be like celebrities and do what everyone else is doing , ' ms @entity6 said .			0
