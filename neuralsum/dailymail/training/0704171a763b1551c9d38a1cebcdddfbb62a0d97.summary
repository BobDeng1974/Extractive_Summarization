researchers found those with a spiritual understanding of life were more likely to suffer from mental illness being spiritual may give life deeper meaning , but it can also make you more susceptible to mental illness , new research suggests			1
a study found that people professing to be spiritual , but not conventionally religious , were more likely to suffer from a host of mental challenges			1
they suffered problems including abnormal eating conditions , drug abuse , anxiety disorder , phobias and neurosis			1
they were also more likely than others to be taking medication for mental health problems			1
professor @entity24 , from @entity25 , and his fellow researchers wrote in the @entity27 : ' our main finding is that people who had a spiritual understanding of life had worse mental health than those with an understanding that was neither religious nor spiritual			1
' the study was based on a survey of 7,403 randomly selected men and women in @entity40 who were questioned about their spiritual and religious beliefs , and mental state			1
of the participants , 35 per cent described themselves as ' religious ' , meaning they attended a church , mosque , synagogue or temple			0
the vast majority of this group were @entity50			0
a further 19 per cent claimed to have spiritual beliefs or experiences without following a specific religion , while 46 per cent were neither religious nor spiritual			2
more than nine out of 10 were white @entity54 , with an average age of 46			0
of the different groups , spiritual people were 50 per cent more likely to have a generalised anxiety disorder and 72 per cent more likely to suffer from a phobia			1
spirituality was also associated with a 40 per cent greater likelihood of receiving treatment with psychotropic drugs they also had a 77 per cent higher chance of being dependent on drugs and were 37 per cent more at risk of neurotic disorder			2
spirituality was also associated with a 40 per cent greater likelihood of receiving treatment with psychotropic drugs			0
individuals of religious faith and those with none experienced equal levels of mental problems , the study found			2
but there were fewer problems with drugs or alcohol among the faithful			2
unlike some @entity87 studies , the new research found no clear relationship between religious belief and happiness			0
one recent large internet study in the @entity87 reported that non-religious people with spiritual beliefs were emotionally less stable than other groups			0
however , they made up only 2 per cent of the study sample			0
the researchers wrote : ' we conclude that there is increasing evidence that people who profess spiritual beliefs in the absence of a religious framework are more vulnerable to mental disorder			1
' the nature of this association needs greater examination in qualitative and in prospective quantitative research			0

researchers at @entity25 say spiritual *believers* are more likely to suffer problems such as eating conditions or an anxiety disorder
