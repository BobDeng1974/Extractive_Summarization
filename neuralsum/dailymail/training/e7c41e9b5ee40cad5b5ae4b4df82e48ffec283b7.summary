by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 5 june 2012 updated : 14:34 est , 5 june 2012 well , today the boats were well and truly pushed out			1
for the service at @entity4 the @entity2 wore a soft mint coat dress : as for the flotilla on sunday , it is again designed by her dresser , @entity8			2
it is of silk tulle , embroidered with flowers , using silver thread			2
a chiffon drape is a lovely , soft touch : it is studded with @entity16 crystals , and a matching drape adorns the hat			0
@entity19 of @entity21 ’s nude lace dress by @entity22 for @entity23 was tailored perfectly to fit her figure – the hem a tad longer than the red dress for the flotilla on the @entity29 – and while i loved it , the fastening of the belt , seemingly made from bias binding , is a little disappointing			0
thumbs up ! @entity0 applauded @entity2 , the @entity35 , the @entity36 for their fashion choices @entity35 ( and @entity22 ) need to understand that the @entity19 will often be seen from behind , and therefore the detailing needs to be beautiful : pearls or diamonds , with hand embroidered loops , not just a hook and eye			1
and i do want to wrestle @entity35 out of her platform patent pumps from @entity46			1
she needs delicate lace shoes , encrusted with pearls , by @entity48 , say , or an @entity50 shoe couturier , such as @entity51			0
the platform is a little too casual for such a formal occasion			2
but @entity35 still looked stunning , especially as her eye make - up has been softened : i love the subtle veil over her eyes , on a hat by her favourite milliner , @entity58 : £ 790 , available on the milliner ’s website			1
the real surprise of the day was that both @entity62 and @entity63 looked fresh , young and appropriate			1
@entity62 wore a blue and white striped coatdress by @entity67 designer @entity65			1
@entity69 born , he studied at @entity70 ’s , and learned his craft on @entity72 and working for designers including @entity74 and @entity75			0
lady in red : @entity19 of @entity21 cut a swathe through the gloomy weather as she stepped on to the @entity80 wearing a vibrant scarlet @entity23 dress - on her lapel , @entity35 wore a maritime - themed brooch featuring two silver dolphins ' i am starting to love these two young women , ' @entity0 says of @entity62 and @entity63 this dress was teamed with tan stilettos by @entity89 , a @entity91 hat and a @entity93 bag , made by sisters @entity95 and @entity96 , who worked at @entity97 and @entity74 before striking out on their own			1
this rock and roll bag label is made from start to finish in @entity69 , not merely ‘ finished ’ there , as so many are these days			0
this bag would have cost about £ 1,000			0
princess @entity63 chose a royal purple dress by @entity103 ( her lovely , small boutique is at 6 @entity105 , in @entity106 ) ; a @entity91 hat ; @entity89 nude stilettos and a @entity110 bag			1
i am starting to love these two young women : they champion brand new talent , know how to mix and match different labels , and have the good sense to wear @entity89 shoes , which are expensive but super stylish and comfy			1
@entity35 should follow suit , and abandon those high street platforms			2
she has such great legs : she really could take a dagger heel			0
@entity120 wore a rose print dress by @entity122 that we ’ve seen before , but at least she wore a hat , by @entity91			0
the @entity36 wore a graphic , basket weave coat by @entity126 , and a ginormous @entity128 hat			0
both items tell me she is feeling much more confident , starting to abandon those safe creams			2
all in all , a triumph .			0

' i do want to wrestle @entity35 out of her platform patent pumps from @entity46 , ' she says of the @entity35
' i am starting to love these two young women , ' @entity0 applauds @entity62 and @entity63
