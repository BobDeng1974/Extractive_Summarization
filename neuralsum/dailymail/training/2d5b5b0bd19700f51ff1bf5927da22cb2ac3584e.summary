by @entity1 reporter published : 14:08 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 16:46 est , 17 june 2013 @entity2 spent 24 years in a @entity4 prison for a string of sexual assaults it was later determined he did n't commit			1
for his decades of unjust incarceration , the state of @entity4 awarded him nearly $ 6million in compensation after his august , 2009 release , which is in accordance with a relatively new @entity4 law that specifies the amount of compensation exonerated prisoners are to receive			1
then came the legal bills - his attorneys charged him more than $ 1million for work they claim to have done to lobby @entity4 lawmakers to increase the amount of compensation for exonerees			1
justice delayed : @entity2 spent 24 years in prison for crimes he did n't commit			1
he was awarded $ 6million for his time in prison - and now his ex-wife wants a piece of the action @entity2 and his former bride , @entity31 , were expecting their first child in 1982 , when @entity2 was first charged in the case that ultimately would send him to prison for more than two decades			1
they divorced nearly 10 years later , in 1992 , after @entity2 says they ' grew apart			2
' now the two are engaged in an ongoing legal battle over compensation she claims she is owed for wages lost by her former husband 's incarceration			0
“ he was a victim of a wrongful justice system , and his family was also , ” @entity45 tells the @entity46			0
last year , a @entity51 judge awarded @entity45 more than $ 150,000 of @entity2 ' compensation , a ruling @entity2 has since appealed			1
the case is likely headed to the @entity55 , where justices will determine what - if any - sort of compensation former spouses of exonerated prisoners should receive			0
in 2009 , the @entity61 passed the @entity62 , which raised the compensation for exonerated prisoners to $ 160,000 for each year a person was wrongfully imprisoned			2
for the 24 years @entity2 spent behind bars , he received a lump - sum payment of more than $ 2million			1
additionally , he will receive a monthly annuity of about $ 11,000 , as well as medical and education benefits from the state			2
compensation : @entity31 feels she is owed compensation for the 24 years her ex-husband spent in prison but @entity2 contends that the compensation is not for lost wages			1
rather , he claims in his appeal , it 's a mandatory payment he is owed under the law for his time spent behind bars			0
@entity4 state senator @entity81 , one of the architects of the @entity62 , seems to agree			1
in an affidavit filed in the case , @entity81 writes that the legislature never intended to compensate exonerees for lost wages ; otherwise it would have been based on their income prior to their incarceration and be subject to taxes ( as the law is written , compensation for exonerees is tax - free )			0
@entity81 notes that the @entity61 recognized that a man can not support his children while in prison , which is ' we drafted the compensation statute to include any child support payments and interest on child support arrearage that are owed by the exoneree			2
' the affidavit was not allowed into evidence			0
after winning his freedom , @entity2 is back in court fighting for compensation another of the law 's architects , state senator @entity112 , says lawmakers had failed to consider former spouses of exonerees when drafting the law			1
' this is an example of the law of unintended consequences , ' he says ' we did not think about entitlement by spouses who had become divorced from these innocent men while they were in prison			0
' regardless of the law , @entity45 says she had every intention of sticking it out with @entity2 while he was in prison			1
“ to me , marriage was for life , and i was going to be with him forever , and we were going to get through this — or so i thought , ” she says			0
prior to the divorce , @entity45 claims she visited @entity2 frequently and provided him with money to buy things in the prison 's commissary			1
at his trial , @entity45 was @entity2 ' star witness			2
the string of sexual assaults for which @entity2 was wrongly convicted happened in 1982			1
several women were attacked and forced to perform sex acts at gun point			0
at least two of the victims wrongly identified @entity2			2
@entity45 provided @entity148 ' alibi , testifying that he could n't be the person committing the assaults because she was with him when some of the assaults took place			0
@entity2 was convicted anyway and sentenced to two 30 - year prison sentences			1
he subsequently pleaded guilty to several other , similar crimes to avoid what would likely have been a life sentence had he been found guilty			0
in 2001 , @entity2 began learning about dna and - with the help of the @entity160 - was able to have his dna tested against @entity158 found at the scenes of crimes supposedly committed by him			2
the dna did n't match			0
however , it did match a convicted sex criminal @entity165			0
' this is one of the worst cases of tunnel vision we ’ve ever seen			0
police seized on @entity2 as a suspect and refused to see mounting evidence that someone else actually committed these crimes , ' said @entity160 co-director @entity175			2
' @entity176 was a one - man crime spree who could have been stopped much sooner if police had followed the evidence instead of locking onto an innocent man			0
' after the @entity51 crimes for which @entity2 was wrongfully convicted , @entity165 committed at least 16 other sexual assaults and related offenses in multiple states			1
of the lawsuit and inflated bill from his attorneys , @entity2 - who says he has no ill - will against his ex - sums his situation up as follows : ' when the cheese is on the table , the rats come out			0

@entity2 was wrongly convicted of a string of sexual assaults he did n't commit
dna evidence cleared him of any *wrongdoing* in 2008
as compensation for his time in prison , the state of @entity4 will pay him about $ 6million
