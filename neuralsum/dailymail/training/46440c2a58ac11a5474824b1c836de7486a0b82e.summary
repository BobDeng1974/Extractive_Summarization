by @entity0 and @entity1 it started with a simple request - just $ 10 to make a potato salad			1
but four days after posting the straight forward - looking project to a crowd - funding website , its creator @entity5 has been inundated with offers of help			2

the initial request for $ 10 came with the simple pitch of : ' basically i 'm just making potato salad			1
i have n't decided what kind yet			0
' he soon amended his goals to include a pizza party for $ 75 and two different potato salads at $ 100			0
the latest stretch goal however , which again has been easily smashed , was to organize a potato salad party for the ' whole internet ' if the project managed to raise $ 3,000			1
mr @entity5 has been adding ' stretch goals ' as the amount of money raised continued to rise after the page was shared thousands of times on @entity22 and @entity23 $ 1 - a ' thank you ' posted to the website and mr @entity5 will say your name while making the potato salad $ 2 - a photo of mr @entity5 making the potato salad $ 3 - a bite of the potato salad $ 5 - choose a potato salad - appropriate ingredient $ 10 - @entity52 out in the kitchen while the potato salad is made $ 20 - a potato salad - themed haiku , your name carved into a potato used in the salad , a signed jar of mayonnaise and the potato salad recipe $ 25 - a potato salad - themed hat $ 35 - a limited edition t - shirt $ 50 - @entity67 recipe book @entity5 told @entity68 he was looking to use the money raised ' to do the most good possible '			1

' people are offering to write potato salad themed songs and make potato salad themed @entity78 apps			1
' in the latest update to the page , @entity5 has posted a video in which he thanks all of those who have pledged money			0
he said : ' this is amazing			0
when i started this campaign my secret goal was that we could make $ 60 and in three days we have made 1,000 per cent of that - $ 5,000 dollars			2
' thank you so much			0
' @entity5 has also decided to give a little something back to all those who have pledged support with a series of ' gifts ' , depending on the amount pledged			0
those who pledge $ 3 will receive a bite of the potato salad , for $ 5 there is the chance to choose an ingredient and those who pledge $ 25 will receive a potato - salad themed hat			1
meanwhile , a pledge of $ 35 receives a t - shirt and those who pledge $ 50 or more will receive a @entity67 recipe book			0
last month , @entity11 loosened its guidelines for projects and now allows users to ask the internet to pay for basically anything that 's not illegal			0
unfortunately the crowdfunding site ’s terms do n’t allow @entity5 to simply make his potato salad as originally planned and donate the huge excess of cash to charity			1
@entity5 told @entity68 he was looking to use the money raised ' to do the most good possible ' q : what are you going to do with the money ? a : i 'm looking to do the most good possible with this opportunity			0
