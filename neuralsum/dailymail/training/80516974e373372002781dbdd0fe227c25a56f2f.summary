these unsuspecting birds very nearly got a right old soaking after they almost found themselves in the way of what appears to be a giant sneeze from this giraffe			2
the quick - witted oxpecker birds however just about managed to get out of the way of the jet of drool fired in their direction by the giant animal			1
the flying water is in fact caused because the giraffe , weighing around 187 stone , has to give its long neck a violent yank to lift it off the ground			2
these unsuspecting birds very nearly got a soaking but they managed to avoid what looks like a giant sneeze from this giraffe the flying water is in fact caused because the giraffe has to give its long neck a violent yank to lift it off the ground the quick - witted oxpecker birds just about manage to get out of the way of the jet of drool giraffes , which can have necks nearly seven foot long , are very vulnerable to predators when drinking so must get their heads up quickly to see what 's going on			1
unfortunately for the oxpecker birds , who groom the giraffe 's body for parasites , it can mean occasionally getting soaked in drool			1
the action shots were taken by photographer @entity41 , 40 , during a trip to @entity43 , northern @entity44			1
the father - of - two , who works at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ' i took the pictures during a weekend away with my family , my wife and my two children			0
' we were driving around the park which is a great place that is trying hard to protect very endangered species			0
' these giraffes were by the water hole and i stopped as i knew they wanted to drink			0

this means however that oxpecker birds , who groom the giraffe 's body for parasites , can occasionally get soaked in drool the action shots were taken by photographer @entity41 , 40 , during a trip to @entity43 , northern @entity44 mr @entity41 said ' despite appearances the giraffe is not sneezing ' - he said the animals always yank their heads back after drinking , which causes the droplets of moisture mr @entity41 said it can be a stressful time for the giraffe ' as they are very vulnerable ' ' in fact despite appearances the giraffe is not sneezing			1
when giraffes drink , they always yank their head backwards when they rear back up and you can get nice pics of dribble			2
' when this happens all the oxpeckers try and get out of the way as quick as possible			0
' it is a very stressful time for the giraffe as they are very vulnerable , they could fall and they ca n't see predators so they are very cautious just before drinking			2
' these giraffes are reticulated giraffes and they only live in northern @entity44			1
