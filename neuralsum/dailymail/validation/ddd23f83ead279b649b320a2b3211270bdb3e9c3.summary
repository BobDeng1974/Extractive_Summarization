in that time , it lost a test series to @entity1 , and was winless in a limited - overs tri-series against @entity1 and @entity64			2
there was some glaring aggression between the teams in the test and odi series , with players on both sides sanctioned and warned that sledging would not be tolerated at the @entity8			0
