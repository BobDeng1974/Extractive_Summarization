@entity9 went to her local opticians to get some prescription sunglasses for a family holiday in @entity13 on august 21			1
but during her eye examination , optometrist @entity14 spotted swelling behind her optic nerve			1
@entity9 ( pictured with her mother @entity18 ) was diagnosed with a brain tumour after her optician noticed a problem during a routine appointment			1
thanks to the optician , she rapidly underwent life - saving surgery @entity9 was rushed from her local @entity27 branch in @entity28 upon @entity29 , @entity30 , to nearby @entity31 for further tests			1
these revealed she had a rare cranial fibroma - a cancer which grows inside the eye - which can be deadly if left untreated and can cause complete blindness within days			2
the next day she was taken to @entity38 where she underwent a major operation to remove the benign tumour			1
her mother @entity18 , 34 , a phone shop sales consultant , urged other parents to make sure their children get their eyes checked regularly			2
she said : ‘ i took her for an eye test because she was going to go to @entity13 on holiday with her friends			0
‘ the optometrist told us there was swelling on eye and told us it was best that we went to the hospital to get it checked out			1
@entity9 went to see @entity14 at @entity27 in @entity28 upon @entity29 to get prescription sunglasses			1
he noticed a swelling behind her optic nerve and suggested she go to @entity31 ‘ on the thursday , the day she was set to go to @entity13 , we went to the hospital in the morning and were then taken to the children 's ward before she had an mri			1
‘ quite quickly after she had another one and i knew something was wrong			0
then they told us the bad news			0
‘ i was heartbroken and in complete shock , you do n't expect news like that , no parent does , i thought it was all a bad dream but it was n't			0
at @entity9 was diagnosed with a brain tumour so she was transferred to @entity38 for surgery ‘ the doctors said the operation could not have gone better but there is still a tumour in her head , it has just been reduced in size			1
‘ i just want to appeal to all parents to make sure they take their children for an eye test			0
‘ what happened to @entity9 shows that this can be the difference between life and death			1
’ despite her life - saving operation , @entity9 acted as if ‘ nothing had happened ’ and was back eating chips and ice cream within half hour			2
mother - of - three @entity18 , from @entity96 - under - @entity94 , @entity95 , added : ‘ we were all in tears , so worried about what was going to happen			0
‘ she could have gone blind at any moment , but @entity9 turned to us and said : “ you lot need to man up , it is me that 's got the problem , not you and the doctors will sort it out ”			2
‘ @entity9 then had the two hour operation and within half an hour of waking up was eating chips , beans and ice cream , it was as if she was back to normal			2
‘ she was just a little tired			0
‘ now i just think what could have been if i would have let her go on holiday , i do n't even like to think about it			0
‘ we went back to @entity27 after @entity9 came out of hospital to thank mr @entity14			1
‘ he had a tear in his eye , we all did , it was very emotional			0
during the surgery , surgeons removed most of the tumour but they were not able to remove all of it meaning that @entity9 may require more surgery in future ‘ she basically thanked him for saving her life , he did a fantastic job			1
’ @entity9 , who already wore glasses but did n't have any symptoms before she went for her eye test , said : ‘ i think everything went fine			2
‘ i was a little bit scared but it was okay , i was just telling everyone to man up , they were all crying but it was n't them having the operation			0
‘ it was good when i woke up because i had two dinners , i joked about having it but they actually gave it to me , it was great			0
‘ it was a bit strange going to sleep , but i am happy i am not in hospital anymore and i am happy that i am through the bad parts of everything now			0
’ @entity9 's mother , @entity18 , has urged parents to get their children 's eyes tested regularly as ' it can be the difference between life and death '			2
image shows @entity27 in @entity28 upon @entity29 where @entity9 was treated mr @entity14 said he was not aware of anybody else as young as @entity9 having a deadly brain tumour discovered by an eye test			1
he said : ' i 'd never seen this in someone of such a young age before and without showing any real symptoms was really very unusual			0
' i 'm just so glad to see @entity9 making a fantastic recovery - it was wonderful to see @entity9 so soon after her operation			2
' her story is obviously quite unusual , but it does highlight how eye examinations can help identify a number of other health issues			0
' with children we recommend getting their eyes checked from the age of three , unless like ms @entity181 , you have any concerns in which case they should come in sooner			0
