@entity6 is to consult on 1,775 potential job losses , including 940 in @entity3 and a further 835 in @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , near @entity11			1
mps and council leaders in @entity3 reacted with fury to the decision , claiming jobs were being lost in @entity18 to protect @entity19 and @entity20 on the @entity21 ahead of the vote on @entity24 independence			1
blow : shipbuilding in @entity3 will come to an end after centuries of maritime history an announcement was expected tomorrow , but was brought forward to today			1
@entity30 will come to an end at @entity3 in the second half of next year			1
in a statement @entity6 said : ' following detailed discussions about how best to sustain the long - term capability to deliver complex warships , @entity6 has agreed with the @entity38 @entity37 that @entity8 would be the most effective location for the manufacture of the future type 26 ships			2
' consequently , and subject to consultation with trade union representatives , the company proposes to consolidate its shipbuilding operations in @entity8 with investments in facilities to create a world - class capability , positioning it to deliver an affordable type 26 programme for the @entity50			0
' in the commons defence secretary @entity51 said that every effort would be made to redeploy workers , and that compulsory redundancies would be kept to a minimum			0
' the loss of a shipmaking capability will be a harsh blow to @entity3 , ' he added as he announced that more than £ 100 million will be invested in the city 's naval base so it can accommodate new warships			1
defence secretary @entity51 admitted the loss of shipbuilding would be a ' harsh blow to @entity3 ' but the announcement was attacked as a politically motivated ' act of lunacy ' by one of @entity3 's conservative councillors			1
@entity71 said : ' this is devastating for the workers and their families but also for all those people involved in the supply chain that keeps the dockyard working			0
' many of those who i represent as a councillor are hugely concerned that this decision has been taken for political reasons because of the referendum in @entity24 next year			2
' @entity85 , leader of @entity86 , condemned the decision to shut down the last remaining shipyard in @entity18 with the capability to build advanced surface warships , saying it was bad news for the defence of the @entity38 and for the @entity50			1
' the remaining yards with the capability to build advanced warships are in @entity24 , and the referendum on @entity24 independence is less than one year away			2
ministers have put the defence of the @entity38 and the future of the @entity50 at real risk , ' he said			2
blow : workers leave @entity6 in @entity19 , @entity8 after hearing the defence giant is to axe 1,775 jobs across its naval ships business the cuts are being made following a decline in orders , with 1775 jobs going between the yards in @entity24 , including @entity19 ( pictured ) and @entity18 with the end of shipbuilding altogether at the @entity3 yard shipbuilding work will be moved to the shipyard in @entity19 , where the @entity120 aircraft carrier has been built the @entity37 will pick up the bill for moving the work to @entity24			1
@entity6 added : ' the implementation of these restructuring activities will sustain @entity6 ' capability to deliver complex warships for the @entity50 and secure the employment of thousands of highly skilled employees across the @entity38			2
workers in @entity3 are likely to feel their jobs have been sacrificed to shore up yards in @entity24 ahead of next year 's independence referendum			1
prime minister @entity134 's official spokesman told a regular @entity136 media briefing : ' these are decisions taken in the @entity38 's national interest			0
' asked whether the desire to encourage @entity24 to vote no in next year 's independence referendum had played any part in the decision , the spokesman said : ' this is a government that always takes decisions based on the national interest			2
' this decision was taken with a view of how we have the best - equipped , best - maintained @entity50			0
that is the basis on which it was taken			0
' he insisted @entity3 would remain the ' home of the @entity50 fleet ' with ' world - class shipbuilding of @entity50 ships continuing on the @entity21 '			2
one the @entity50 's new aircraft carriers have been completed , there will not be enough orders to sustain the three yards livelihoods : workers at the @entity6 shipyard in @entity19 , @entity8			1
as many as 1,000 jobs may be lost at three of the company 's @entity38 shipyards amid fears there will be no new work once two aircraft carriers are finished the grim news was given to workers at a series of meetings at 11am across the affected sites , before they were allowed to go home for the rest of the day			1
@entity176 , @entity177 national officer and chair of the @entity179 ' ( @entity179 ) shipbuilding national committee , said : ' there is no doubt that this is a devastating day for the @entity38 shipbuilding industry and the company will have justify to us the job losses planned			0
' @entity187 , general secretary of construction workers union @entity188 , said : ' once again workers have found out that their jobs are under threat through the media			0
it is highly distressing and extremely unfair to treat a loyal workforce in such a way			0
' this is a highly skilled workforce , so it is absolutely essential that the @entity198 and @entity6 minimises job losses , guarantees the long - term future of all the shipyards and continues to invest in training the workers of the future			0
' some of the jobs set to be lost at the @entity3 , @entity19 and @entity20 shipyards may be offset by a contract to build a new @entity50 carrier , the @entity208			1
hundreds of jobs are expected to be lost at @entity19 and @entity20 the @entity37 announced it is to commission three new ocean - going offshore patrol vessels for the @entity50 , to be built by the @entity6 yards on the @entity21 in @entity24			1
the deal provides work for the company between the completion of the current aircraft carrier contract and the start of the @entity208			0
the @entity219 union voiced its ' deep concern ' over the loss of so many skilled shipbuilding jobs and has called for an urgent meeting with ministers and the company			0
deputy general secretary @entity225 said : ' for an island nation and in this time of increased global uncertainty , we should be seeking to maintain our shipbuilding capacity , not reduce it			0
' shipbuilding is not only a key element of our defence infrastructure , it is also an industry where the @entity38 should be a world - leader , creating and sustaining highly skilled and well - paid jobs			2
' what 's next ? a computer - generated image of the @entity208 that could keep work going @entity240 , @entity241 's leader in @entity24 , said the referendum had created uncertainty and delayed decisions about the future of the two yards on the @entity21			1
' for me , of course , i ’m not arguing @entity24 to leave the @entity38 , i want @entity24 to stay part of the @entity38 and i want the jobs in @entity3 shipyard because these are highly skilled jobs and a very effective workforce and as defence workers in my constituency have highlighted to me , they ’re concerned of the uncertainty the referendum has brought about			1
' that ’s why there ’s a delay about this			0
we do n’t want to see the workforce across the @entity38 set against another			0
' and in fact , the power and strength of the @entity38 is that we can pool resource and we can manage these things in a different way , ' she told @entity270			0
@entity271 mp , @entity241 ’s shadow defence secretary , said : ‘ there will be huge anxiety amongst the highly skilled workforce , their families and the communities they live in			2
‘ this has significant consequences for the future of shipbuilding in the @entity38 and has implications for the future defence of our country			0

axe falls on @entity3 but jobs also at risk at @entity19 and @entity20
it is feared there will be no more work once two new carriers are finished
warships have been built in @entity3 since 1497 under @entity297
