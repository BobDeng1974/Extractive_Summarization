workers involved claimed they were denied work , often for merely raising legitimate concerns about health and safety on building sites			1
legal action is being taken on behalf of some of those on the list			1
compensation : building workers who appeared on the ' blacklist ' claimed they were denied work , often for merely raising legitimate concerns ( posed from library ) the eight firms announced that they are working together to develop a scheme to compensate construction workers whose names were on @entity33 ( @entity34 ) database			1
a statement said : ' the companies - @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , sir @entity42 , @entity44 @entity43 and @entity45 - all apologise for their involvement with @entity34 and the impact that its database may have had on any individual construction worker			1
' the companies have joined together to establish the @entity52			2
' the scheme is intended to make it as simple as possible for any worker with a legitimate claim to access compensation			1
' the companies have invited workers ’ representatives to enter into a period of engagement to ensure that the proposed terms of the scheme are fair and effective			2
the group is also engaging with other interested parties			2
@entity68 business secretary @entity67 said @entity69 wants the companies guilty of blacklisting to come forward ' at this time we are not able to share any further information on the proposed scheme			2
however , once engagement with the workers ’ representatives has concluded , we will announce full details of the scheme which we would like to open to applicants as soon as possible			2
' we have discussed the scheme with a number of other construction companies			0
' we encourage participation from across the industry and would welcome interest from any company that had been a user of , or subscriber to , @entity34			1
' the companies involved in the scheme would support the introduction of a code of conduct to ensure nothing like this can happen within the construction industry again			2
' the @entity13 was closed down following a raid on its @entity97 offices by the @entity98			0
but unions said workers continued to be discriminated against if their names were on the list			1
a total of 44 firms were found to be using the blacklist			0
the names of a number of environmental activists were also on the blacklist			2
the @entity110 is organising a national day of action on november 20 over the blacklisting			0
the development follows years of campaigning by unions who welcomed the news ; although some campaigners said more should be done			0
@entity120 of the @entity122 union said : ' firms admitting they engaged in a terrible abuse of the civil rights of thousands of @entity43 workers is an important step			1
' the next step is clean up and pay up			0
this remains our demand on the construction industry			0
' unite assistant general secretary @entity133 said : ' these employers appear to be responding to union demands to ‘ own up , clean up and pay up ’			0
' however , any proposals can not exclude the involvement of blacklisted workers and their trade unions			1
' it is now time for the unions and the employers to thrash out the details and build on these proposals , which look encouraging			0
' it must be a priority to get blacklisted workers back into work			1
unite is calling on contractors to employ , and where relevant support the up - skilling of blacklisted workers			1
' firms admitting they engaged in a terrible abuse of the civil rights of thousands of @entity43 workers is an important step			1
the next step is clean up and pay up ' - @entity149 assistant general secretary @entity133 ' many of these workers have spent years out of work as a result of being blacklisted			1
employers have a moral duty to give them back the jobs that were wrongly taken away from them			0
' unions have demanded a thorough @entity168 - style inquiry into the scandal			0
shadow business secretary @entity67 said : ' @entity69 has led calls for those companies guilty of blacklisting to come forward , apologise and provide compensation to victims of the scandal			0
this announcement is a welcome step , though it should have been made a long time ago			0
' given that 44 companies have been named as having used the construction industry blacklist , it is regrettable this announcement only covers eight firms			0
' we will be closely monitoring and scrutinising the compensation scheme as it progresses to ensure it provides proper redress to victims swiftly and commands confidence			0
' it also underlines the need for a full inquiry into the blacklisting scandal to make sure it is never repeated			0
if ministers refuse to take this crucial step , a future @entity69 government will			0
' @entity195 , general secretary of the building workers ’ union @entity196 , said : ' this is a step forward			1
the companies involved are admitting their guilt for the first time and are recognising that the victims of blacklisting deserve compensation			2
' however , to be a legitimate scheme , all 3,213 blacklisted victims or their dependents must be notified that they were on a blacklist			1

more than 3,200 names , mainly of building workers , were kept on the list , drawn up by a shadowy organisation called @entity33
workers involved claimed they were denied work , often for merely raising legitimate concerns about health and safety on building sites
@entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity222 , sir @entity42 , @entity44 @entity43 and @entity45 have all apologised for their involvement with @entity34 and may compensate blacklisted workers
