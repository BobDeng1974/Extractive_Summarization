@entity0 lost 9st but was left with huge saggy breasts resembling ' coal sacks ' after losing a staggering nine stone , @entity0 expected to be brimming with confidence			1
but her joy at dropping four dress sizes and shrinking from a 22 to a size 14 was shattered every time she caught sight of her chest in the mirror			1
the 41 - year - old said despite shedding the weight she was left with huge saggy breasts resembling ' coal sacks '			1
she said she regularly had to ' tuck in ' her 48ee breasts , leaving her feeling more embarrassed of her body than ever before			1
after being denied a reduction operation on the @entity21 because her body mass index still deemed her to be obese , the support worker turned to a private clinic in desperation			1
and today , after having half her breast tissue removed in a three - hour operation , ms @entity25 said she feels as though she has been freed			1
she said : ' i absolutely hated my breasts			0
they were like giant coal sacks and i spent all my time trying to tuck them into place to stop them escaping from my bra			1
' i was very self conscious , not to mention the back pain they caused			0
' but she was rejected from the @entity21 waiting list for a breast reduction because after losing weight her @entity42 crept back up to a fraction over the 30 limit - at which point a person is thought to be obese			1
ms @entity0 has three children aged 20 , 17 and 14 and lives in @entity48 , said : ' i was on the waiting list for a reduction for two and a half years after i lost weight then one day i got a call telling me i would have to come off it because of my @entity42			1
' i was disappointed because this was not a cosmetic issue and because i felt my @entity42 was only just over because of all the excess weight i was carrying on my bust			2
' she was estimated to be carrying at least 6lbs in breast tissue and without it her @entity42 would have fallen into the healthy range			1
but as her marriage broke down ms @entity25 felt unable to contemplate her future as a single woman without addressing the confidence issues that stemmed from her bust			0
' no amount of exercise in the gym made any difference			0
and swimming , running , anything like that was impossible due to the sheer size and weight of them			0
' eventually seeing how distraught she was her parents helped her fund private surgery with @entity86			0
she said : ' i felt weird going for the consultation because to me this was not cosmetic surgery , this was absolutely necessary			0
' surgeons agreed her health and confidence would benefit from an uplift and reduction combined			2
she underwent the Â£ 5,800 operation in september 2013 at the @entity97 in @entity98			0
her bust was reduced to a more manageable 40d thanks to the removal of half of her breast tissue			1
ms @entity0 said : ' i just lifted the bed sheet and said " wow "			0
i could n't believe the coal sacks had finally gone			1
i was over the moon to see the back of them			0
the 41 - year - old was denied a breast reduction operation on the @entity21 because her body mass index was just over 30 - the limit where a person is classed as obese - after losing weight but today , after having half her breast tissue removed in a three - hour operation at a private clinic in @entity98 , ms @entity25 said she feels as though she has been freed ' the surgeon was amazing and really did a wonderful job			1
' after the reduction last year she says she felt less back pain and her confidence blossomed			2
she said : ' people think large breasts are a blessing but they can be a curse			0
' i 'm delighted to see the back of them			0
finally i can walk tall			0
' @entity131 , spokeswoman from @entity132 said , ' breast reductions are one of the most life changing procedures we offer here at transform			2
' the vast majority of patients see a significant improvement in their quality of life post op. ' we hear patients talking of how much easier it is for them to exercise post op - going swimming , running , attending exercise classes are some of the activities patients are now able to take up which they would have struggled with before			2
' we 've seen a steady year on year increase in the numbers of women enquiring about breast reductions - between 2013 and 2014 , 22 per cent up from the year before			2
' it 's great to hear about the positive effect it 's had on this patient 's life			0
