with glow sticks highlighting our every move , it was a non-stop underground fitness party ' clubbers tend to burn between 500 and 600 calories per hour dancing non-stop - the same number you would during a high - impact aerobics class in a room in east @entity9 at 6.30am , 200 people are dancing to deep house club anthems , waving their arms about , whooping and cheering , and generally getting pretty excited			1
it 's a rave , yes , but not as you know them			1
this is not an after - party			2
these people have not dragged their weary selves from a club to an underground bunker in which to continue their slcohol - soaked merriment			2
these people are stone - cold sober , have just woken up and are about to go to work			2
welcome to the world of early morning raving			0
@entity117 partygoers dance to music by @entity120 from 6am in @entity121 ... before going to work wake up ...			0
put your trainers on ...			0
head to @entity117 for a pre-breakfast rave before going to work the premise of the monthly event - whose subhead is ' rave your way into the day ' - is to turn clubbing on its head and allow music fiends to embrace beats and bass without alcohol , and to rev themselves up for the day through dancing			1
@entity17 @entity138 , who provided the soundtrack to the event at @entity141 as @entity120 with his @entity17 partner @entity142 , told @entity143 : ' we came straight from playing at @entity146 festival and the energy in the club was the same as it had been there			0
a lot of people were really getting their sweat on			0
' @entity138 , who also takes rave to the yoga generation when he @entity17 for outdoor yoga classes in @entity156 , added : ' most people there were about to go to work , and some of them looked a bit bewildered at first , but then everyone really started getting into the music			0
' it 's clubbing with a good , happy vibe , and none of that dark edge			0
' the view from behind the @entity17 booth at @entity117 held in east @entity9 organisers hope to make the event a weekly occurrence , and the @entity172 hope to be asked back			1
' it was free - form exercise			0
it came from the idea that people go to aerobics or the gym in the morning , and this is like that without it being structured			0
' it 's like clubbing , but instead of crawling out into the darkness afterwards feeling horrible , you go to work feeling great			0
and instead of having a beer you have coffee , a croissant and a massage			0
' the next drop - in event is scheduled for wednesday 4 september			2
is an early - morning rave exactly what you need to feel energised in the morning ?			2
