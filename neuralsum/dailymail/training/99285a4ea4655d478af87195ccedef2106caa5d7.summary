@entity2 is leaving the @entity3 , his attorneys confirmed just two days after it was announced the 28 - year - old cop would not face trial in the shooting of unarmed teen @entity7			1
when @entity2 gave his first tv interview on tuesday , he said it was unlikely he would return to his job but still had n't made a final decision at the time			2
one day later , it seems his mind was made up			0
' it 's not a question of if , it 's a question of when , ' attorney @entity18 told @entity19 , saying @entity2 is currently negotiating his resignation from the @entity22 police department			1
' realistically , he ca n't go back to being a police officer			1
there 's no illusion about any of this			0
but it 's the way in which he leaves ... that 's important to him on different levels , ' @entity18 added			2
he said within three hours he had gathered his belongings and gone into hiding leaving his grass only ' half mowed '			2
@entity2 's legal team also spoke about the tough decision for him to go into hiding and contemplate quitting the police force in an interview with the @entity48			1
in the interview , the four - person legal team who specialize in representing law enforcement officers , say it took @entity2 a long time to realize it would be too dangerous to return to his job , either in @entity36 or anywhere else			1
he has been on paid administrative leave ever since the incident , continuing to receive his $ 45,300 salary			0
' i think i expressed to him , " do you realize your first call [ back on the job ] will be to a blind alley where you ’re executed ? " ' attorney @entity60 recalls			0
' he took a pause for a minute , thought about it and said , " oh			0
" that is the reality			0
' @entity2 talked about some of the dangers he would face and bring to his co-workers if he returned , in his first and only tv interview with @entity74 's @entity73			2
' do you really think it 's possible ? ' @entity2 asked			2
' do you think they would accept me ? do you think it would be safe for me ? those are all questions , not only for me but other officers			0
is attention brought to me going to hurt one of them ? can i put them in that situation ? ' the shooter : @entity2 's attorneys also spoke out about what it was like to represent the cop the last three and a half while he was under investigation in the shooting death of unarmed 18 - year - old @entity7			1
@entity2 pictured above ( left ) in his first television interview , which aired tuesday tragic : the 28 - year - old cop shot dead @entity7 at the end of a 90 - second encounter with the teen last august 9			1
his attorneys say witness accounts of the event were ' total bull '			1
the crime scene pictured above in the @entity48 article , @entity2 's legal team went on to call witness accounts of the shooting ' total bull ' while describing how they 've shielded their client during the more than three - month grand jury investigation			1
they said that @entity2 was forced to keep a low profile and would spend time in dark theaters watching movies to avoid detection			0
while they said @entity2 had become the ' poster child for bad race relations ' his lawyers were confident that they had the upper hand throughout the grand jury process , thanks to conflicting witness reports			2
but it was also those first accounts of the shooting that painted their client in the most negative light , and what turned the incident in the predominantly - black community of @entity36 , @entity22 into a national issue			1
right after @entity7 was shot on august 9 , the friend who was with the teenager at the time told reporters about how they were minding their own business when @entity2 drove up and started harassing them , even pulling @entity7 by the collar			1
friend @entity142 said his friend tried running away , and was turning around with his hands raised in surrender when @entity2 fired the fatal shots			2
@entity60 calls this account ' total bull ' and that @entity7 's blood trail actually showed he may have been charging towards @entity150 right before he was killed			1
meanwhile , they say their legal defense was beefed up by @entity2 's consistent account of the events , which they claim have not changed since right after the shooting to his first and only tv interview on @entity74 two days ago			1
one side of the story : @entity2 's attorneys were especially unconvinced by @entity7 's friend @entity142 , who has always said that the teen was raising his hands in surrender when @entity2 fired the fatal shots			1
@entity142 pictured on the right with his own attorney surrender : @entity142 's account has turned into somewhat of a rally call for those outraged by @entity7 's death			2
at protests after the grand jury decision was announced monday night , demonstrators marched with their hands up , chanting ' hands up , do n't shoot ' and ' no justice , no peace ' ' everybody says that [ his story ] was so rehearsed and he was so prepped , ' attorney @entity181 said of the @entity74 interview			2
' but the way @entity184 tells the story has not changed from the minute the shooting occurred			0
he could probably tell it in his sleep if he had to			0
' just married : @entity2 's lawyers also explained how they shielded him from the public during the grand jury process			1
they say he rarely went out and when he did he would wear ' disguises '			0
one rare occasion he left the house was in october , to get a marriage license ( pictured above ) @entity2 's lawyers also went on to describe how they have protected his privacy during the grand jury process , especially after his home address was published in news reports just 10 days after the shooting			2
from there , @entity2 spent a week living with one of his attorneys , @entity33 , before his legal team found him a ' quote - unquote permanent ' residence			1
they say he has n't been back to his house since			0
@entity2 's lawyers say they made the decision early on to keep their client out of the public eye - quite a difference from @entity212 , the @entity213 man who was acquitted on charges of shooting dead 17 - year - old @entity215 two years ago , sparking similar outrage on race relations			1
' [ @entity212 ] is an idiot , @entity184 was not , ' @entity60 said			0
' any criminal defense lawyer that has half a brain says , " shut up , do n’t say a word			0
" ' only a few pictures emerged of @entity2 during the three and a half months he was under investigation , but he still took great care not to be recognized on the rare occasions he would go out in public - like when he recently obtained a marriage license in @entity229 , @entity22 for his wedding last month to fellow police officer @entity231 , 37			1
attorney @entity18 says @entity2 used ' certain [ disguise ] tricks ' picked up in police training to avoid attention			1
' he cross-dressed a lot , ' @entity236 joked			0
they also say he went to the movies a lot , since the darkness provided privacy			0
' you have to take precautions , where you sit in a restaurant and where you drive , ' @entity2 elaborated to @entity74			0
' you have to make sure no one is following you			0
' outrage : the grand jury 's decision not to indict @entity2 on any charges in @entity7 's death led to violent riots in @entity36 , @entity22 monday night			1
the massive demonstration means @entity2 will likely have to continue living a very private life what next ? it 's still unclear what @entity2 and his wife will do once he leaves the @entity36 police department			1
above , protesters ransack a police cruiser monday night the continued violence in @entity36 , the fact that his face has been broadcast on all major networks for the past four months , and an ongoing federal investigation mean @entity2 will likely have to continue living like a recluse			2
it 's also uncertain what will happen to his wife , who is also a police officer in @entity36 , since her picture and name have been reported			1
that question will likely be answered later , as it was revealed wednesday that she is pregnant , and may already , or soon will be , on maternity leave			0
one option that has been discussed is @entity2 being put in witness protection , but the cop would n't qualify for the program unless he was indicted on federal charges and made to testify in court			2
money is also a concern , once he is released from the @entity3			0
supporters raised some $ 500,000 to help him pay his legal bills and other costs on two @entity286 pages before the accounts were shut down			0
it 's unclear though whether @entity2 would be able to spend the money or need to put it towards defending himself in a possible civil suit from @entity7 's family			2
in their @entity48 interview , @entity2 's lawyers explained why the police officer has not made a public apology to the @entity7 family			1
' even if he gave the most heartfelt apology , they ’d still not like it , ' @entity60 said			0
' taking a life is a horrible thing to have to do , ' @entity18 said			0
' and yet , the key phrase is , " to have to do			0
" because that is what he thinks			0
is that going to make the @entity304 feel any less grief ? ' wo n't say sorry : @entity2 's attorneys also explained why he has n't issued a public apology to @entity7 's family ( @entity7 's mother @entity309 pictured above in the white beanie and blue shirt , after hearing the grand jury decision ) , saying they would never accept anything he has to say			1

the @entity36 , @entity22 cop 's legal attorneys said he is currently negotiating his resignation from the police department
' he ca n't go back to being a police officer , he knows that , ' attorney @entity18 told @entity19 on wednesday
@entity2 's four - person legal team , who specialize in representing cops , went on to say they were confident they could win the case if it went to trial
called accounts that @entity7 was holding his hands up in surrender when he was shot dead ' total bull '
they also shed light on how the 28 - year - old spent the last three and a half months in hiding , saying he used disguises when he went out in public
revealed that @entity2 was in the middle of mowing his lawn when he was told he had to go into hiding
