@entity0 is holding court at his weekly pre-match press conference , and one of the local reporters wants to talk crossbars			1
might it be a good idea to raise it a bit so more goals could be scored for the benefit of goal - hungry @entity11 fans ? the well - travelled former @entity14 and @entity15 midfielder – now manager of the newest @entity17 team @entity18 – responds with good humour			1
' well , soccer 's being doing quite well for about 150 years now and if you look at the amount of people who play and watch it 's still doing quite well , so i do n't really see a need , ' he replies with a patient smile			1
@entity0 has been here for eight years now and witnessed the process at first hand , going from the backwoods of the @entity37 to the major leagues that @entity18 have been elevated to this season			1
the years have not dimmed @entity0 's impish enthusiasm and , now 53 , he speaks of the game 's expansion with an almost missionary zeal			1
perched in the morning sunshine on a bench at @entity15 's pristine training facility he talks about the upside of salary caps , what @entity49 and @entity50 can expect , the humility of his star signing @entity54 and his hopes of an eventual rivalry with @entity59 's troubled @entity58 project			1
@entity50 will join @entity60 in the summer after spending 17 seasons at @entity62 midfielder @entity49 has signed a two - year contract with @entity64 the aforementioned names ' imminent arrival is just one reason why the @entity17 is achieving a greater resonance on the other side of the @entity70			1
' i think @entity73 people are fascinated with @entity11 , ' says @entity0			1
' you see the baseball , @entity76 and basketball and wonder whether football can take off here			2
i 'm glad to say i think the only question is how big it becomes			2
' perhaps we have slowly had to educate some of the media			2
one of the things that has kept football down a bit is that some of the high profile media have n't known the sport , and maybe some people are scared of it			2
they guard their own sports quite carefully			2
' @entity0 's @entity92 adventure began in the unlikely setting of a pub in his native @entity95 , where he bumped into @entity97 director @entity96			1
@entity54 is playing out the final days of a distinguished career on the doorstep of @entity100 ' he was looking to invest in soccer over here and i had just lost my job at @entity105			2
i 'd been with @entity105 to @entity106 that year for a pre-season friendly and there were 15,000 people there			2
i thought the game was taking off and so i thought i 'd try and get in early			2
' i started off at the bottom in the @entity37 in @entity112 , @entity113			0
sometimes there were less than 1,000 people in the ground , not great facilities , lot of college kids , but you could see the game growing			0
' now you look at @entity121 and they would be not that far from @entity122 and @entity123 in average gates , getting 45,000 per game			0
' his belief that in ten years the @entity17 will be world 's ' third or fourth biggest league ' is fuelled by his daily influx of emails : ' i only have to open my inbox every day to see how many people want to come out here			1
all the time agents are offering me players who are going to be out of contract in two years ' time , big international players who will may be be 29 then			2
' @entity18 midfielder @entity54 has the highest salary in @entity17 history while @entity59 is still looking for a ground in @entity58 – last month he made an unusually low profile visit in further efforts to resolve the issue – @entity18 sold out their opening game last month at the temporary home of the @entity147			1
' we got 62,000 our first game			0
that will not be sustained but we are building a 21,000 seater stadium with the capability of going up to 28,000 and we will fill that			0
' it helps having @entity54 as the club 's marquee signing , a superstar in name but evidently not in behaviour , as @entity0 quickly discovered : ' we went on pre-season to @entity161 and we hired a few vans to transport everyone around			1
he volunteered to drive one of them and then would wait around for the kids who are straggling and the last to leave , to make sure they 're not left behind			0
he 's a remarkable person			0
' he knows what an impact the involvement of @entity59 could also have if he can sort problems out 250 miles south , and admits a vested interest : ' i think he has faced an uphill battle on the back of what happened with the baseball there			0
the city invested millions into the @entity179 and they were n't happy with how it worked out with the owner			0
midfielder @entity0 scored 71 goals in 226 games for @entity14 ' there 's nobody at this club that does n't want to see @entity59 get it off the ground in @entity58			1
rivalry makes sports , and we could get that going with @entity58 and maybe @entity192 , which is also a few hours up the road			0
' i think @entity59 will do it there , it 's very difficult for a city to turn down a major league sport over here with all that it brings			0
one of things that has helped in @entity18 is that it 's a young city and they want to show it has a lot more to offer than @entity100			1
the city has united behind this			0
' @entity50 and @entity49 will be coming sooner and , he says , there will be a few culture shocks			1
' they will have to get used to the travel for an away game			0
six hour flights leaving on thursday and not arriving back until sunday night			0
the time difference , sleep patterns			0
' i think they 'll be impressed with the athleticism in the league			0
six years ago coming here in your mid thirties you could get away with coasting but those days are gone			2
@entity49 will be fine and so will @entity50 because they 've got great football brains			1
' @entity0 helped @entity14 lift eight trophies during his six years at @entity224 and they will find a much more level playing field			1
' the great thing about the @entity17 is because of the salary cap there is parity and you do n't know who is going to win the league			1
the @entity234 is exciting in many ways but you know only three or four teams can win it			0
' nobody is more patriotic than me and i 'm very proud to have played for the likes of @entity14 and @entity15			1
but the thought that @entity14 might never win another trophy does n't sit well with me			1
they were level five years ago with @entity15			1
it 's unthinkable that @entity14 might not win anything again			1
' @entity0 is that rare bird in @entity73 football , the traveller , having also spent a season at @entity251 as a player			1
it has made him a better coach , although he admits his @entity256 excursion was not about self - improvement			2
' i earned more money going to @entity256 , one of the reasons we do n't export any more from @entity73 is that we are the gravy train			0
if you want to earn a lot of money you stay in @entity73			0
if you go back to the likes of me , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , the truth is we all went for more money			0
but it does help you learn			0
' now he is doing something very unusual , having to effectively build a team from scratch after @entity18 's ' promotion ' , working all the time within the salary cap			1
they currently lie third in the @entity284 after six games			0
' the bottom line is we have got just under 4 million pounds to work with for 28 players ( one of them is his son @entity289 )			0
you get three of them outside the wage cap but they count as 400 each against it so there is a lot of juggling			0
' @entity0 never gets homesick , and there is a constant flow of football people passing through from @entity73 , usually taking their children to @entity304			2
' the funny thing is that is brought my kids over quite a few times when i was a player and they were younger , but now i 'm working here i 've never set foot in the place			0

former @entity14 and @entity15 midfielder @entity0 is now manager of the newest @entity17 team @entity18
the 53 - year - old has been has been in the @entity11 for eight years and witnessed the boom of ' soccer '
@entity0 says @entity50 and @entity49 are in for a few culture shocks when they join the @entity17 *revolution*
