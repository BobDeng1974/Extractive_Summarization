@entity0 , the headmaster of the @entity1 , claims the demise of grammar schools has reduced social mobility in @entity5 the headmaster of @entity1 claims the demise of grammar schools has reduced social mobility in @entity5			1
@entity0 took over at the helm of the £ 32,000 - a - year boarding school , attended by 20 former prime ministers and most male members of the royal family , seven years ago			1
the son of a security guard and a secretary , mr @entity0 attended @entity1 himself on a music scholarship and was ' the first male in my family to be educated over the age of 14			1
' but asked whether social mobility is ' flat - lining ' or even reversing , as former minister @entity21 warned at the launch of a government report on the subject last year , he said : ' that is possible '			1
in an interview with the @entity28 magazine , he said he was ' personally not a fan ' of the 11 - plus examination which was which widespread until grammar schools were largely abolished in the 1970s			2
but mr @entity0 , 59 , who used to teach at a grammar school that is now a fee - paying school in @entity32 in @entity33 before moving to @entity1 , added : ' but there is no doubt that the demise of the grammar schools has brought a reduction in social mobility			1
' until the 1960s there were some 1,200 grammar schools in the @entity5 , but most were axed in the 1970s and their number is now capped by law at 164			2
they educate some 160,000 pupils			2
they routinely top the gcse and a-level league tables , and in recent years they have produced more than half the total number of a grade a-levels in difficult subjects such as maths and physics			0
on the dominance of @entity1 - educated men in the government including @entity56 , @entity57 , and several of the prime minister 's closest advisors , he said : ' i think this is one of those moments in history that wo n't be repeated '			1
he said he was pleased the archbishop of canterbury @entity64 and actors such as @entity68 's @entity67 and @entity69 ' who have a rather different take on the world ' were also alumni			2
' that reflects the @entity1 i live in ' , he said			0
' the exciting thing about being in a place like this is having bright , young , aspirational people who see the world in very different ways			0
' i came from a background that was so alien to any kind of educational experience			0
my father was a security guy at @entity84 and my mother was a secretary at the local hospital			0
' i came in on a scholarship			0
not to be romantic about it , but that is a reason why i do the job : i feel an obligation to pay back			0
' mr @entity0 said when his aunt , from @entity95 , was told he had been offered a place at @entity97 , ' she had heard of @entity1 , @entity98 and all these places , but only by name , so when she heard i was going to @entity101 she assumed i had messed up so badly at @entity1 i had to be sent to one of the others			1
' he cautiously welcomed the government 's education reforms which will create a wave of new free schools and academies			1
but mr @entity0 said there was a ' huge amount of reform , maybe too much ' , going on , but ' no joined up plan			1
he said : ' i think most of the people i work with ca n't see the big picture we are aiming for			0
' mr @entity0 attended @entity1 in @entity116 himself on a music scholarship @entity1 takes 250 boys a year but he said a third of those who finished in the top 100 in the entrance examination were not offered places because they needed to show they could ' thrive in a boarding school environment			1
' he said : ' we are not just about academic results , and boys need something else they can bring to the party			0
i do n't really mind what it is – playing the clarinet , football , jiu - jitsu , something that excites and enthuses the boy			2
from all my experience , if you have that , it translates into other areas and you create a kind of language that is positive			0
' @entity1 itself is sponsoring a free school – @entity145 – which will open next september , a non-selective boarding school seven miles from @entity1 in @entity116 , where many of the pupils aged 11 to 18 will come from local authority care or at risk groups .			0
