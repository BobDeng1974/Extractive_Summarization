a @entity1 barber is offering area parents a new way of punishing their misbehaving sons : by shaving off the top of their hair to make them look like balding old men			1
@entity9 from @entity8 in @entity10 calls it his ' @entity12 ' and offers it for free to kids who need to ' act grown			1
' the 34 - year - old father says he started advertising the unique punishment after using it successfully on his own 12 - year - old son			2
after the cut -- named for the 2008 @entity32 film @entity33 -- he says @entity27 's marks ' skyrocketed dramatically			0
' interest in the offer also skyrocketed after @entity9 posted before and after photos online of the first boy whose parents brought him in for the @entity12			2
the ornery boy initially looks to have not a care in the world but his smirk quickly goes away for the after photo			0
@entity9 told the @entity26 that some naysayers have likened the punishment to abuse			1
' there are a few people that are saying it 's emotional abuse ; but on average , everyone is applauding , ' he said			1
like a bald old man : @entity8 co-owner @entity9 says he had the idea after successfully using the punishment technique when his own 12 - year - old son 's grade 's last year lots of interest : @entity9 offers the cut for free three days a week and says interest skyrocketed after he posted his first taker 's before and after pictures on social media anyway , said @entity9 , the punishment is n't meant for everyday use			1
' i hope that most people wo n't have to do this unless it 's an extreme circumstances and nothing else is working , ' he said			0
' first , you talk or implement your restrictions			0
' but when the conventional ways do n't work these days , you have to get creative			0
' the first boy to get the special was n't forced to walk out of @entity76 with the crazy cut			0
once the lesson set it , @entity9 buzzed off his remaining hair for a more presentable look			1
' he understood why it happened and he rolled with it and allowed it to make him stronger , ' @entity82 said			2
' he understood why it happened and he rolled with it and allowed it to make him stronger ' : @entity9 wo n't force his subjects to leave the shop looking like @entity33 -- he lets them learn their lesson then gives them a more presentable ' do			0

@entity82 , an owner at @entity8 in @entity10 , @entity1 , tried it out on his own *unruly* son and says his behavior *immediately* *improved*
*federick* or one of his team will cut a large monk - like circle out of the top of boys ' hair
some have said his *shaming* - style discipline constitutes emotional abuse , but @entity9 says most *feedback* has been *positive*
