by @entity1 reporter published : 07:08 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 20:53 est , 2 december 2012 @entity2 and @entity3 loved their house by the river			1
the only problem was that when the @entity9 got too high they invariably ended up marooned in it			0
rather than move , however , the couple came up with a perfect – if expensive – solution to the problem and spent £ 100,000 having the £ 140,000 home raised 12ft off the ground to create what amounts to a bungalow on stilts			2
they decided to take action after their bungalow stood 4ft 6ins under water in 2007 - and cashed in part of their pensions to fund the project			0
after builders carefully raised the bungalow , in @entity29 , @entity30 , the couple saw their forward planning pay off in last week 's heavy floods			1
defiant : @entity2 and @entity3 had their home raised on to stilts and now are protected from flooding left : @entity3 and her dog were caught in a flood in 1990			1
here they are seen being aided by neighbour @entity39			0
right : mr and mrs @entity3 at home counting the cost of a flood in 2000 retired greyhound trainer mr @entity44 , 75 , watched as heavy rain and winds lashed at his home last week - with flood water lapping 2ft above the ground			1
but thanks to the stilts , the pair could shelter in a dry home			2
the area where the kitchen and conservatory once stood still remains under 1ft of water			0
mr @entity44 , who has nicknamed their home the ' bunga - high ' instead of bungalow , said they were delighted with the results of the work			0
overhaul : mr and mrs @entity3 's house during its renovation in october 2009 - after water from the @entity9 repeatedly gushed into their home and made it uninhabitable temporary : the wooden outhouse where the couple lived while they waited for the work to be done he said : ' we just could n't face being flooded again , but we can sleep at night now			1
' the planners were n't keen at first but our mp @entity76 was very helpful to us when we needed to get planning permission			1
' the couple cashed in some of their savings and used insurance money to pay for the £ 100,000 work , which started in 2009			2
their home was left uninhabitable following the 2007 floods and could not be sold easily			2
mr @entity44 said the work was costly but has turned the couple 's lives around as they now have a house they can live in and sell in the future			1
tall order : the house required extensive building work in order to elevate it 12ft off the ground flood : @entity2 and @entity3 's home in 2000 during the height of a flood which made their home uninhabitable their house insurance has also dropped from a four - figure sum with a £ 15,000 excess to less than mr @entity44 pays for his car insurance			1
he said his only regret was that the builder who implemented his plans , @entity110 , 55 , died in august before he saw the scheme working			0
' he did a great job and i wish he could have seen it work , ' he added			0
water levels in @entity29 are dropping but remain at 3ft deep in places - with councils attending more than 600 calls for assistance from flood victims in the last 10 days			0
relieved : the couple watched from their new balcony as the flood water lashed around the stilts			0

retired couple @entity2 and @entity3 used pension money to raise their @entity29 home onto stilts
@entity76 waded into couple 's *battle* for planning permission
their elevated home was *untouched* by the *latest* floods
