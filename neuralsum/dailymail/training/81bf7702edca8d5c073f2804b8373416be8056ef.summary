by @entity0 scientists say they have found a potential cure for motor neurone disease , which could be in clinical trials as early as next year , it was revealed today			1
researchers from the @entity7 hope that their ground - breaking research could lead to a cure for one of the forms of the disease , which affects more than 5,000 people in the @entity14 , including professor @entity15			1
it is also hoped that the research will help develop a way of screening people with a family history of the condition and fixing any faulty gene before symptoms begin			1
it is hoped the research could lead to a cure for the type of motor neurone disease that affects 5,000 people in the @entity14 , including professor @entity15 , pictured professor @entity32 , leading @entity29 and chair of @entity31 , said : ' quite simply this is a devastating disease , patients suffering from motor neurone disease can die within one or two years in the most severe cases , and lose all ability to use muscles , including arms and legs			1
' it can prevent them from having a normal life and there is no treatment at all for this			0
' some of the cases are genetic , caused by a faulty gene called called @entity48			1
we are devising a strategy to take out the faulty gene			2
' the breakthrough , if this a success , will be huge because there is no treatment for this syndrome			0
because it is genetic , if patients can be screened for the gene , because of family history , then we can intervene even before the symptoms appear and rescue them			1
it can be a cure			0
' the professor added that he hoped the treatment would begin clinical trials by 2015			1
he added : ' we plan submission for regulatory approval by august 2015 , for permission to take this therapy to patients in the clinic			0
it will be in clinics as a clinical trial at first , then if that is a success we would look to make it available for patients after that			2
' professor @entity32 hoped the treatment would begin clinical trials as early as august 2015 ( file picture ) until now , all available treatments and drug - trials conducted across the world have failed to effectively halt the progression of the condition			1
@entity87 , the only drug that has demonstrated a survival benefit , prolongs life for just three to six months and may not be effective in all patients			0
but prof @entity32 said he was confident that this research would be a success			2
he explained : ' because we are targeting the causative gene , based on the previous studies that we have done , there 's a very good chance that this can be a success			0
' we are in an advanced programme looking at @entity100 in childhood and in babies , and it 's cause is not because of a faulty gene but it is in fact totally absent			2
in our programme we are using a virus carrier to attempt to restore the gene back			0
' for example , in a mouse model the mice that had the disease would survive two weeks maximum from birth			0
but when we treated these mice we seen that they survived for nearly 400 days , so you can see the strength of this strategy			0

scientists say the potential cure could be in clinical trials by next year
may lead to cure for type of disease suffered by professor @entity15
could screen those with a family history of condition and fix faulty gene
*experts* confident that the research will prove to be a success
