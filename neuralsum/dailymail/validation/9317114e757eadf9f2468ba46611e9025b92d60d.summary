@entity0 said @entity1 is open to an arrangement with @entity3 and suggested @entity3 's backbenchers would support some @entity1 policies @entity7 will be ' held hostage ' in @entity9 by the @entity1 , it was claimed today as @entity0 said there was no way @entity3 could win without her			1
a dramatic collapse in support for @entity3 in @entity14 is expected to rob mr @entity7 of an overall majority , forcing him to rely on the @entity1 to form a government			1
ms @entity0 teased the @entity3 leader today , claiming he is still ' clinging to the pretence ' that he has a chance of winning a majority on may 7 , insisting she will wield ' clout ' in @entity22			1
ms @entity0 said her party was open to an arrangement with @entity3 after the election			1
the @entity14 first minister hinted that many of @entity3 's mps would support certain @entity1 policies such as bringing an end to austerity and scrapping @entity32			1
after weeks of pressure , mr @entity7 has ruled out a formal coalition with the @entity1 but he could be forced to do a deal to stop them voting down his government			2
ms @entity0 told @entity39 's today programme : ' he is still clinging to the pretence he has got some chance of winning an overall majority			1
' we have got vast experience as a minority government ... the principles are the same			0
you have to build alliances , you have to win votes on a case - by - case basis			0
' it would be far better than what usually happens to @entity14 at @entity22 , which is we are ignored or sidelined			0
' the bottom line here is , if @entity14 wants to have that influence , that power , that clout in @entity22 , the only way get it is to vote @entity1			2
' if there is real @entity1 strength in the @entity62 we can force progressive change			0
' she also repeated the threat from former first minister @entity66 to lock the @entity67 out of government , even if @entity69 wins the most seats			0
brushing aside claims it was arrogant , ms @entity0 replied : ' if the @entity67 ca n't command a majority , then they do n't deserve to be in government			1
' labour leader @entity7 used the launch of his election campaign at the @entity77 in east @entity78 today to claim : ' there is one way to get the @entity67 out and that 's to elect a @entity3 government ' senior conservative @entity82 condemned the remarks as proof that mr @entity7 would be propeped up by a party which wanted to break up the @entity86			2
he said : ' now you have it straight from @entity0 – it is the @entity1 's sworn intention to hold @entity7 hostage in @entity9 and dictate terms on how @entity92 is governed			1
' and we know too what 's in the ransom note : £ 148 billion more wasteful borrowing , higher taxes on ordinary families , weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay			0
labour campaign chief @entity102 ( pictured ) said @entity104 sturgeon has an ' anyone but @entity3 ' strategy and is committed to independence ' we can not let this happen to our country			2
the only way to keep @entity7 and the @entity1 out of @entity9 is to vote @entity111 on 7 may			0
' mr @entity7 sought to play down the prospect of an @entity1 deal , tell activists at his election campaign launch : ' there is one way to get the @entity67 out and that 's to elect a @entity3 government			1
' @entity3 campaign chief @entity102 told @entity120 channel : ' the agenda of the @entity1 is very obvious - they want to drive down the vote of @entity3 in @entity14 and they want to drive up the @entity111 vote			1
' why ? because ( ms @entity0 ) remains committed to independence			2
she judges the most propitious circumstances to be of a @entity111 government here in @entity22 after the election in may , and after that to try to secure support in the 2016 election in @entity14 for a second referendum			0
' later ms @entity0 told @entity120 : ' in that post-election scenario , if the @entity1 wins the trust of people in @entity14 and is there in numbers , then we 've said very clearly there are no circumstances in which we would support a @entity111 government			1
' we would be open to a working arrangement with @entity3 - not a formal coalition , i 've always said that 's highly unlikely			2
' that could be an arrangement that 's akin to confidence and supply			0
' if we were to have an arrangement on that basis , we 've been very clear we would want an alternative to austerity - modest spending increases that still see debt and deficit reduce as a share of income , but nevertheless allow us to invest in things like innovation and infrastructure and protecting the vulnerable			0
' she said that a fresh independence referendum would not be the price for a post-election deal : ' voting @entity1 in the general election does n't lead to another independence referendum			0
' if there is to be another independence referendum - and i hope that one day there will be - that will only happen if people elect a @entity171 in a @entity173 election that has that in the manifesto and has the ability in the @entity173 to pass that legislation			0
