@entity14 , who restored and reopened the traditional cinema in 2004 , announced the decision on the company 's website			1
mr @entity14 said he was fed up with the whingeing from those attending the screenings without babies , even though they declared they ' might contain babies '			1
' @entity36 staff have enjoyed collecting still - warm nappies from under tables , and who put up with difficult first time mothers with armoured tanks ( prams ) and a not always helpful attitude as they spread everything from the tank everywhere , ' he said			1
and mr @entity14 also claimed that the cinema has been forced to reconsider over the ratings on the tuesday films			1
he said : ' those who threatened us with the authorities if little - faces turn up in prams for a 15 certificate			2
clearly babies of 0 to six months are under 15			2
' thank you for such moral vigilance			2
there 's only so much whingeing , bitching and snitching from all sides one can take			1
eight years of it is enough			0
' screenings : he says he has cancelled the baby matinees ( stock image ) due to ' whingeing , bitching , snitching and the law ' the issue had been picked up by members of the public , including @entity70 , who wrote on social media that she had ' complained about this a few years ago '			1
some have been left disappointed by the ban , blaming other parents			0
@entity76 said : ' shame how some spoil it for others leaving dirty nappies under tables is disgusting			0
' @entity82 posted on the cinema 's @entity84 page : ' very , very , very sad to see tuesday matinee times have changed to 2pm , see you in a few years when i no longer have school runs in the afternoon			1
' the 1930s original @entity91 cinema has one screen in its proscenium and was described by @entity94 the @entity96 tourist site as ' possibly @entity98 's most beautiful cinema '			1
it opened on may 9 , 1938 , with @entity100 starring @entity101 and in the early 1970s the balcony was boxed off to create two screens in the upper circle			0
the proscenium was soon closed and turned into a bingo hall while films still played in the smaller upstairs screen			0
on february 28 , 1988 , the cinema was closed and it would be 30 years before a film would be projected onto the screen			1
beautiful : the 1930s original @entity91 cinema has one screen in its proscenium and was described by @entity94 the @entity96 tourist site as ' possibly @entity98 's most beautiful cinema ' after its revival in 2004 , complete with large , comfy seats and a full wine and snack menu , it has received great plaudits and opens with new titles most days and nights			1
the cinema claims to follow a simple formula involving ' civilised and enticing surroundings ' with a ' warm atmosphere '			1
they also boast of cheap tickets and do n't sell popcorn or hotdogs			0
downstairs , in the stalls , are big red , swivel chairs at small , round , candlelit tables , with white tablecloths to the floor			0
guest speakers over the years have included @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 among dozens of other familiar faces			0
from april babies are banned for , among other things , being under age			0
here ’s why : matinees included babies from the outset in 2005			1
the experiment proved difficult , too many complaints			0
so late in 2007 we had to restrict babies to tuesdays only			0
it was included in the programme for young mums & dads to enjoy their first six months of bewilderment with a popular grown - up film at the @entity36			2
here , for a few short hours , they could be reminded that the world they had left was still here			0
it became , a meeting place , an escape into the latest films everybody ( else ) was talking about			0
now , due to a combination of whingeing , bitching , snitching and the law , it is over			1
whingeing : some without babies , upstairs would rarely miss the chance to complain , even though tuesdays matinees declare ' might contain babies ' and do , does , did ! bitching : as above but with the added missionary misery of @entity36 staff , who have enjoyed collecting still - warm nappies from under tables , and who put up with difficult first time mothers with armoured tanks ( prams ) and a not always helpful attitude as they spread everything from the tank , everywhere			1
snitching : those who threatened us with the @entity185 if little - faces turn up in prams for a 15 certificate			2
clearly babies 0to6 months are under 15			0
thank you for such moral vigilance			0
there ’s only so much whingeing bitching and snitching from all sides , one can take			1
eight years of it is enough			0
finally , the law , with little to resemble intelligence , decrees : only @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 with little or no adult bite , can be screened when babies are present			2
sorry babies and parents your time is up			0
however , saturday kids matinees are always under @entity207			2
so providing you can resist all of the headings above , take your warm nappies etc home , and leave the tanks outside , you ’re welcome			0
all matinees will start at 2pm .			2
