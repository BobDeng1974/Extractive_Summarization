by @entity0 short bouts of moderate exercise - such as walking or steady cycling - can improve energy levels among people suffering from multiple sclerosis , research suggests			1
patients said they had an improved quality of life and suffered less fatigue after taking part in exercise sessions lasting just a few minutes at a time			2
in a 12 - week programme , 60 patients undertook short periods of moderate - intensity aerobic exercise in 18 supervised and 18 home - based exercise sessions			2
people with @entity8 said they had an improved quality of life and suffered less fatigue after taking part in exercise sessions lasting just a few minutes at a time the sessions involved five three - minute bouts of exercise , with two minutes of rest in between each bout			1
as the study progressed , patients were encouraged to exercise for longer - such as five four - minute bouts - or to take shorter rest periods			1
many patients also did muscle strengthening and balance exercises and were taught cognitive behavioural techniques , such as setting goals and understanding the benefits of exercise			0
the results were compared with 60 @entity8 patients receiving usual @entity45 care who were not told to take specific exercise			0
researchers found that people on the moderate - intensity programme reported improved fatigue levels and had better quality of life for up to nine months			1
people said they had improved emotional wellbeing , social function and better overall quality of life compared with the other group			0

researchers found that people on the moderate - intensity programme reported improved fatigue levels and had better quality of life for up to nine months the study , carried out by professor @entity67 from the @entity68 , also found the programme to be cost effective compared with usual @entity45 care			1
funded by the @entity72 , the research was published in the @entity73			0
professor @entity67 said : ‘ it seems illogical to turn to exercise as a way of managing fatigue , but the results showed that a pragmatic programme based on short bouts of moderate - intensity exercise can really help people improve symptoms and quality of life			1
