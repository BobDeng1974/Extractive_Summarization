racism still exists when cutting a deal , according to a new study			1
black people had to put more money on the table for a white person to accept their offer in comparison to offers from people from other ethnic backgrounds and other white people			2
the study carried out at @entity13 was set up to test if racial tensions came to the surface in financial deals			0
the study found that black people had to put more money on the table for a white person to accept their offer in comparison to offers from people from other ethnic backgrounds or other white people researchers believed that prejudices linking black @entity27 men with ‘ aggression , hostility , and untrustworthiness ’ would affect their chances of getting a fair deal when negotiating with a white person			1
they set up a series of experiments where 49 participants from different ethnic and racial backgrounds engaged in an ‘ ultimatum game ’ , where players either rejected or accepted split offers of money			0
the participants were paired off and researchers designated one of the pair as a ‘ proposer ’ , who was given $ 10 to split with their partner			0
if their partner accepted the offer the money would be split accordingly , but if it was rejected then both the participants had to walk away from the failed deal empty handed			2
@entity52 showed how on the whole the participants were more likely to accept a monetary offer from a white proposer than a black proposer the results , published in the journal @entity59 , showed how on the whole the participants were more likely to accept an offer from a white proposer than a black proposer			0
further analysis showed than black people had to offer more money in order for their opposite numbers to accept the deal			1
researchers believe the effect was down to ‘ specific stereotypes or prejudices associated with black @entity27 ’			0
the study was inspired by the @entity76 's debt ceiling debates in 2011 where political parties were prepared to reject a deal even if it appeared to damage their own supporters			1
psychologist dr @entity80 , who led the study , said : ‘ many members of both the @entity82 and @entity83 seemed willing to incur costs that would hurt their own constituents in order to vote along political lines			2
the study was inspired by the @entity76 's debt ceiling debates in 2011 where political parties were prepared to reject a deal even if it appeared to damage their own supporters ‘ the debate led us to wonder : are people willing to punish members of another group when they perceive their behaviour as unfair , even when exacting that punishment comes at a personal cost ? ‘ it has been suggested that race bias in economic decisions may not occur in a market where discrimination is costly , but these findings provide the first evidence that this assumption is false			1
‘ our work suggests that after offers are on the table , people perceive the fairness of those offers differently - even when they are objectively identical - based on race			2
’ the study highlighted the fact that the amount of money changing hands was small in the experiments and , had the potential financial gain been greater regardless of how ‘ fair ’ the deal was , the participants may have been less likely to reject it			1
however , dr @entity80 and her colleagues said their findings have ' broad implications ' for other situations where people punish others because they think they are being unfair			0
she said : ‘ these findings may be especially relevant for legal and economic decisions and serve as a potential example of how people punish unfair or negative behaviour in real - life			0

people from other races , however , did *n't* suffer the same discrimination
research was inspired by the 2011 @entity76 's debt ceiling debates
*scientists* observed how at this time , political parties were prepared to reject a deal even if it appeared to damage their own supporters
