the future is looking bright for @entity2 actor @entity1 , who last night won the @entity3 at the @entity4			1
but 24 - year - old actor admits his life could have turned out quite differently after he attended a ' rough ' school in @entity8 and then had a number of brushes with the law			1
he won the @entity12 thanks to acclaimed roles playing a violent teenager imprisoned in @entity15 and a prisoner of war in @entity18 's @entity17			1
' i have n't done time , but only by the skin of my teeth , ' he once admitted			0
now keen to put his misdemeanors behind him , he 's reluctant to speak about his crimes in interviews but has confirmed he once faced a custodial sentence			2
speaking to @entity33 for the @entity34 last year , he said : ' some of the roles , like @entity36 in @entity15 ( @entity36 is a violent youth offender who is taken to an adult prison in the film ) , have n't been much of a stretch , really			1
' it 's just quite hard for me to be open about it			2
partly because the stuff i got involved in as a kid was quite serious , and partly because i 've now got my @entity45 visa			0
the actor , pictured in the film starred up in 2013 , said playing @entity36 , a troubled teen who ends up in prison , was n't ' much of a stretch ' as he once faced a custodial sentence himself the actor dated @entity52 in 2012 but they split up due to ' incompatible work schedules ' ' when i was younger , i got into a lot of trouble and was made to feel guilty for a long time			1
i was in and out of court , and then i had a young offender 's referral order for a year			2
and that was at the time when i was trying to be an actor at the @entity63			2
' i was in real court the day i was starting a play called @entity66 at the @entity63 in @entity67 – waiting to find out if i was getting a custodial sentence			2
' but fortunately for @entity1 , he was n't locked up for the ' serious ' crime and eventually went on to establish himself as a leading man in @entity21			1
he admits the glittery awards parties and dinners with @entity18 are a far cry from his working class upbringing in @entity76 , @entity77 , where he once had dreams of being a footballer or joining the army			0
his mother , @entity81 , was an employee for @entity82 while his late @entity84 father @entity83 worked on the railways for @entity86			0
the close - knit family help keep @entity1 's feet on the ground as his career soars , with his mother now working as his manager and his sister , @entity93 joining him on the red carpet on numerous occasions			1
@entity18 , pictured with @entity1 at the @entity2 premiere of @entity17 , said he ' has something unique to him ' @entity1 plays @entity98 in @entity99 , pictured , an athlete who survived a @entity102 pow camp they both joined him at the @entity12 where @entity1 said they would make sure he stayed on best behaviour while the champagne flowed			1
he joked yesterday : ' i 've got my mum and sister down here with me strategically so i 'll be well - leashed tonight			1
' @entity1 attended a catholic secondary school in @entity8 , which he described as ' rough as f * * * ' , and he left with just two gcses in @entity113 and drama			1
summing up his education in an interview with the @entity117 , he said : ' what i learnt aside from [ anything ] academic at school was probably very valuable lessons in terms of how to lie , how to play the game , how to play authority against itself			0
' he attended a tv workshop in @entity127 which he thanked in his bafta acceptance speech as it was there that he made it his mission to pursue a career in acting			0
as he tried to make his name as an actor , he juggled his auditions around doing menial work on a farm to earn money			2
after a few minor roles in shows like @entity140 , he then got lucky being cast as a @entity142 supporter in this is @entity113 and then a troubled drug dealer in @entity145			1
he has since admitted that his background gave him an edge over the other stage school actors trying out for the roles			0
big parts in ' 71 and @entity15 followed , but his big break into @entity21 came when @entity18 cast him as @entity98 in @entity99			1
@entity1 admits she had to do ' background checks ' on him thanks to his criminal past , which made obtaining an @entity45 visa difficult			1
but @entity18 was adamant @entity1 was the actor she wanted and has championed him ever since , even visiting @entity8 to meet his family			1
@entity1 with two of his @entity145 co-stars , @entity156 and @entity158 , in 2010 @entity1 once dated co-star @entity159 ( both pictured in a promotional poster for @entity145 ) the @entity77 - born actor , far right , in one of his first roles as a @entity142 supporter in this is @entity113 speaking to vulture about why she cast him , she said : ' i 'd seen so many young men for this movie , and it became very clear to me at a certain point that there are so many great actors out there , but there were still things i continued to look for and did n't find			1
' i had to find a man who was a real man 's man , who had that physicality , who was an everyman but also disciplined and willing to go to all these places emotionally			1
it was hard finding that really capable young actor where you really believed he could survive all that time on a raft or could take 220 punches [ as @entity188 does in a pow camp ]			2
' there are not a lot of young men in their 20s like that			0
@entity1 has something very unique to him			2
i challenge you to find another young man full of more fire			0
' @entity1 did n't let @entity18 down , taking to the part with gusto , even losing a stone in weight to portray the survivor of a @entity102 pow camp in @entity204			2
he 's won rave reviews for the role and has since gone on to be cast in @entity207 alongside @entity208 and @entity209 with @entity210 , directed by @entity211			2
@entity1 , pictured left at yesterday 's @entity12 , is rumoured to be dating model @entity212 , right , and the pair are set to star together in the film @entity207 @entity207 also stars model of the moment @entity212 , sparking rumours that she and @entity1 were dating			1
in his interview with the @entity34 last december he did n't confirm or deny the rumours but went as far to say , ' yeah , i am a boyfriend to someone			0
' when pressed if he was boyfriend to @entity212 , he said : ' er , i 'm not able to make comment at this stage			0
because i 've got trust issues			0
you 'll say something i did n't say			0
' if he is dating @entity212 , it would n't be the first time he 's had a relationship with a co-star			0
during his time on @entity145 he dated actress @entity159 for a year - another rising star to graduate to the big time after recently being cast in the new @entity237 film			1
she once described him as the love of her life and was heartbroken when they split up			0
another famous ex of @entity1 's is the pop star @entity52			1
he dated the former x factor judge for a few months in 2012 but they called time on their relationship due to ' incompatible work schedules			0
' even after their break - up , the singer sang his praises			0
she told @entity248 : ( @entity249 ) was one of the most genuine guys i ’ve ever met			0
' he ’s never spoken about us publicly			0
he restored my faith that there are still good guys out there			0
' the young actor 's schedule certainly looks set to remain busy for the near future as he has come a long way from being a troubled @entity8 teen .			1
