it was meant to be a magical visit , creating special memories for some children who are unlikely to live to see next @entity4			1
but as dozens of children with cancer stood waiting in the cold , some risking their health to do so , it began to become clear a special @entity4 visit was not going to happen			1
children and their parents waited more than an hour for a visit by the @entity15 bus at @entity16 at the @entity17 , only to be told the bus was not coming and given no reason why			1
many had been waiting at the roadside in wheelchairs and attached to drips , eager to catch a glimpse of the iconic truck			1
others , suffering with cancer and other diseases , had risked their already fragile health by standing in the cold and families travelled from across the north west of @entity31 for the visit			1
children with cancer were left waiting for more than an hour in the cold for a visit from the @entity15 bus , which failed to turn up to @entity16 at the @entity17 @entity35 and her partner @entity36 waited with their 16 - year - old daughter @entity37 who was diagnosed with incurable bone cancer in 2010			1
the family , from @entity40 , @entity41 , found out that the cancer had spread to @entity37 's ribs and lungs last week , and said they risked her health to wait in the cold to make happy memories fearing that this may be their last @entity4 together			1
miss @entity37 , mother to @entity49 , said : ' it 's potentially @entity37 's last @entity4 and every little treat is huge			0
we were looking forward to getting our photo together with the truck			2
there were children there in wheelchairs with drips wrapped in blankets , it was heartbreaking			2
' my daughter has got lung tumours , the cold air is a deterioration to her health - but we were making another memory			2
' miss @entity37 said as they waited more than an hour with other families , excited to see the truck , they began to wonder if it would actually turn up			2
' i kept thinking it 's late , it wo n't let these children down , it ca n't let these children down , ' she added			0
' i was just as excited as them			0
' @entity77 , waited with her 11 - year - old daughter @entity78			0
@entity78 recently beat leukaemia after being 24 hours to live			0
@entity80 ( left ) and @entity77 ( right ) waited with their daughter @entity78 for the @entity15 truck staff at @entity16 were forced to tell children and their families the truck was not turning up the mother - of - four , from @entity89 , said : ' all the children were shivering			1
there were children there on drips and we kept having to get them extra blankets			2
' my children cried all the way home			0
' some of the children there may never get the chance to see it again , that 's the part that broke my heart			0
' @entity16 provides free accommodation for the families of children who are being treated at @entity17 and @entity109 's neonatal unit			2
staff at @entity16 were forced to announce that the visit from the truck had been cancelled when it failed to show up on sunday			1
@entity15 said a ' miscommunication ' meant the driver had not been told the correct time to turn up at the hospital and apologised for the mistake			1
a spokeswoman said : ' this was an oversight on our behalf and we 're saddened to hear that many families were left disappointed			0
we want to try to make it up to everyone and bring happiness and @entity4 cheer to the @entity16 , so we are in touch with the charity to arrange another special stop within the next week			0
