@entity0 has turned down the chance to work under @entity2 at @entity3 to sit on the television sofa next season for @entity6			1
after being announced as one of the @entity6 team in their 50th anniversary season , @entity0 told his one million @entity11 followers that he no longer held a coaching position at @entity3 where he worked as @entity13 ’ first - team coach last season			1
he was asked : ' @entity0 , are you still on the coaching team at @entity3 ? ' and replied : ' no '			2
they will now try to speak to @entity0 to see if he can remain connected with @entity3 in some other way , possibly in an ambassadorial or community role			1
a spokesman said : ' we remain of the view that we wanted him involved and did n’t think his television work would get in the way , as it has n’t done for his brother , @entity41			0
' but 37 - year - old @entity0 , who was roundly criticised for his co-commentary during @entity44 ’s @entity25 match against @entity45 in the summer , decided he wanted to concentrate fully on his broadcast career			2
his position under @entity48 was likely to be more junior and less influential than it had been under @entity51			0
confirmation : @entity0 takes to twitter to confirm that he is no longer on the coaching staff at @entity54 @entity0 played nearly 400 games in 11 years at @entity3 before signing for @entity56 in 2005 and returned to @entity54 as a coach last year			2
but with @entity48 assisted by @entity19 and @entity20 as well as backroom staff from @entity59 , @entity0 has decided to throw his full lot in with the @entity61 , rivals to @entity63 who have made his brother @entity66 a broadcasting star			0
@entity6 will have a new feel to it this season following the retirement of @entity69			0
besides @entity0 , host @entity70 will be joined on the sofa by newcomers @entity72 and @entity74 , and @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77			1
@entity0 ’s decision to leave @entity3 was probably partly - influenced by the negative response to his work for the @entity61 in @entity26			1
joining the team : the former @entity56 and @entity3 player will be alongside the likes of @entity75 and @entity74 they had more than 400 complaints about @entity0 ’s staccato and monotone delivery leaving the ex-player to admit it has been ' harder ' than he expected , joking that he was glad he could ' help the nation sleep '			1
even so , the @entity61 have decided to try to utilise his insight and knowledge of the game in a different way			0
the news will disappoint @entity3 who are keen to have as many former players on their staff as possible			0
executive vice-chairman @entity98 said on the club ’s recent pre-season tour of @entity101 that he hoped @entity0 and @entity21 would have a part to play on @entity48 ’s team .			0
