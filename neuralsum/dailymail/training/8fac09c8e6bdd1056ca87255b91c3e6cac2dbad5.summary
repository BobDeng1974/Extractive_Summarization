a @entity1 soldier who left to fight alongside @entity3 militants has described @entity4 as little more than ' office workers and villagers ' who are high on drugs because they are so terrified			1
@entity8 from @entity9 , @entity10 , served in the @entity11 for four years before travelling to @entity12 in 2014 to join the battle against @entity15 extremists			1
having returned home he has revealed he would be prepared to rejoin the fight - despite the fact that he and his family have been targeted by militants			1
' before travelling to @entity12 , mr @entity8 was given training by @entity30 , a @entity31 private security agency offering self - defence courses , weapons classes and training in tactical fighting			1
they organised a recent meeting where he spoke about his experiences and his motivation for entering the war torn country			2
he said : ' i just could not look at this injustice			2
it was necessary to do something			2
' he had travelled to @entity12 using his own money after making contact with @entity48 , the @entity49 , using a link he found on the internet			1
he had then been contacted via @entity53 and eventually had a @entity55 interview a few days before he flew to @entity56 , where he underwent a further personal interview and his details were checked			2
he said : ' they wanted to make sure i did n't have any connection to the @entity15			2
after that i got my equipment , and was sent to the front line			0
' having returned home mr @entity8 has revealed how he would be prepared to rejoin the fight - despite the fact that he and his family have been targeted by militants suggestions that is are a well - organised and disciplined unit were not true , he claimed , adding : ' they are ordinary civilians from various places involved in the conflicts who have to fight			1
' they do not have a choice , and they do n't have have any information , or even any clear leadership			0
many of them are heavily involved in taking drugs they are so terrified			0
' mr @entity8 fought with @entity84 , the military forces that fight in @entity12 , @entity56 and @entity85			1
but he revealed that the forces he joined were not particularly disciplined either			0
he said : ' there is no planning			0
they say " let 's go this way " and they go that way and they fight			1
but they are not afraid of @entity96 , they are defending their families and their homes			0
' he added : ' i tried to pass on to them some of the basics of military tactics , but they were not interested , because it was in conflict with their ideology			0
' many people spoke @entity111 , he said , and he also learned some @entity3 words			0
he had even been given a @entity3 name by his fellow soldiers			0
' the logistics left something to be desired - they would eat rice on the frontline and there were not even enough bowls to go round , so seven people would be eating out of the same bowl , and if one was sick , they would all be sick			1
' he said that although he had left the frontline to return to the @entity1 , he was now worried about his life and that of his family after ' fanatics started to blackmail me and my family '			1
' there was a reward of £ 250,000 for my death , ' he said			1
' of course , there is a big danger that the @entity15 will target us , i am now a public figure in the war against them , and a hit against me would be probably something they try to use in their @entity145 ' after the @entity148 attacks i had police guards around my house			0
police were sure that it was my turn next			0
i guess that was a bit of an eye - opener but i 'm sure it will work out well in the end			2
' mr @entity8 has a girlfriend and a son in the @entity1 but said he was still prepared to return to @entity12			1
he said : ' the matter is complicated though because of all the information about me , and the fact that my photograph was so widely shared			0

@entity8 left to fight in @entity12 in 2014 after four years in the @entity11
the 25 - year - old soldier , of @entity9 in @entity10 , has now returned home
prepared to rejoin fight even though family has been targeted by militants
he describes @entity4 fighters as little more than ' office workers and villagers '
claims there was a £ 250,000 reward for his death and that his family has been blackmailed by fanatics
