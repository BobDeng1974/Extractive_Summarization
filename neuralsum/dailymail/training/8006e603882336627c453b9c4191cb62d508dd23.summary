looking up into the night sky , a stunned photographer realised he had seen something special when he captured these amazing pictures			0
what perhaps looks like a multi-coloured flying saucer is in fact a rare weather phenomenon known as a ' fire rainbow cloud '			1
the series of photographs were taken by @entity11 as the cloud hovered over south @entity13 , @entity14			1
mr @entity11 had just returned home from a game of tennis when he saw the odd sight as the sun dropped behind a storm cloud near @entity21 in the early evening			1
burning bright : the rare phenomenon appeared behind a storm cloud near @entity21 , @entity13 the 49 - year - old said : ' i grabbed my camera and headed out			1
it did n't take long for the small ' blob ' of a cloud to take on some colour			2
' then the saucers appeared			0
i got a little excited			0
then it turns out to be something just amazing			0
' i was just amazed at what i was witnessing , watching it slowly change			0
i 'm shooting this truly rare and amazing sight , shot after shot and i realise there is nobody else around me			1
' mr @entity11 , a director at a jewellery services catalogue company , added : ' i wanted to say ' hey look up there ! check that out ! ' but there was just me			2
' at least when i tell the story , people will believe me because i have so many pictures			0
' atmospheric optics expert dr @entity47 said ' fire rainbow cloud ' was not the best way to describe the phenomenon , which is also known by its proper name of circumhorizon arc			1
he said : ' to be blunt , it is a very silly and misleading name			0
the arc is not a rainbow and has nothing to do with fire			2
' what is happening here is that on sunny afternoons , cumulus clouds boil upwards , pushing layers of moist air above them even higher where they cool and condense to form cloud caps or ' pileus ' ( @entity67 for cap )			2
' when pileus clouds form very quickly , their water droplets tend to be all the same size , the perfect condition for irridescent colours			0
' saucers in the sky : @entity11 looked up and saw the colours change before his eyes until they turned into these saucer - like shapes array of colours : the circumhorizon arc falls behind the dark storm cloud end of the rainbow : @entity11 shot a series of photographs before the rare sight disappeared from the skies			1
