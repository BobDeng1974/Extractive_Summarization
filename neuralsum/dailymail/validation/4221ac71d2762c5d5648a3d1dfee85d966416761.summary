' when you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play			0
all games have potential ( for crowd trouble ) but clearly some games have more potential than others			0
' they are big clubs , not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture , late on a weekend in particular , alcohol is a factor			2
' if you give people four , five , six hours more drinking time , do n't be surprised if in a highly - charged atmosphere , their behaviour is n't good			0
villa fans leap over hoardings at full - time , and the decision to play the game at 5.30pm is being questioned @entity2 goalkeeper @entity105 is mocked by an @entity1 fan following the home side 's second goal ' if you 're looking at whether alcohol was a factor , there was disorder at a public house near the ground before the game , people being arrested coming into the ground for being drunk and disorderly , being drunk seeking entry to a football ground			1
' if you looked at the people who came onto the pitch , a few of them looked like they were worse for wear from some substance and i do n't think there is any coincidence that where there 's alcohol involved , people 's behaviour tends to deteriorate			2
' he added : ' i do think there is an issue here for the broadcasters because that game was scheduled for a 5.30 kick - off to meet the @entity80 's scheduling			0
' broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously			0
' what we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately			0
if you look at the four games for the @entity7 quarter - finals this week , you could n't probably have picked a worse one to have on a saturday tea - time than a local derby between two big clubs			0

and @entity2 boss @entity13 has called for a lifetime ban for any of the club 's fans who were found to be responsible for throwing seats			1
' if that was the situation , and they 've got cctv cameras up there , those supporters should never come into another football ground			0
it is like people coming into someone else 's house - you have to show respect			0
' @entity2 forward @entity186 is escorted off the field after a row with an @entity1 fan the pitch at @entity16 can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass @entity13 was also concerned about the ease with which spectators were able to get on to the pitch			1
he added : ' i am old enough to have seen isolated incidents happen like that			0
i do n't want to have a go and take anything away from what happened on the pitch and what happened in the game			0
' if one thing , @entity1 should look at the stewarding because with a game at this time of night , 5.30pm , you need to police it properly , and i am sure @entity1 will look at it			2
