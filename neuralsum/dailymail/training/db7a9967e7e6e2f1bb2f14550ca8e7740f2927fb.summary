by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 as children , @entity2 and his younger brother @entity3 would play golf and kid each other that a certain putt would be to win the @entity9			1
when he crouches over a six - footer at @entity10 some time this week @entity2 might think back to those days , in the achingly sad knowledge that his brother will not be here to see if he can hole it			1
in may 2009 @entity3 was killed in a car crash while travelling up to the @entity16 , one of the country ’s top amateur events			1
outsider : @entity2 made it to @entity22 after qualifying through a play - off he was 19 and , like @entity2 , a @entity24 international reckoned to be an outstanding prospect			1
the memory of him will be all the more vivid tomorrow when @entity2 tees up for his @entity22 debut , having realised his dream of making the field through qualifying at @entity30 earlier this month			1
of course , there will be butterflies , although these have a completely different meaning for the @entity35 - based @entity34 compared with other people			2
‘ my mum is quite a spiritual person and she relates the butterfly to @entity3 , ’ said @entity2 after completing a practice round at @entity38			1
going up : @entity2 has rubbed shoulders with the likes of @entity43 this week , who was his practice partner he took it as an omen when he saw one on the second hole of his second round at qualifying as he battled to get one of the precious spots for this week ’s tournament			1
‘ this butterfly came to rest by the hole and it did n’t move , ’ he said			2
‘ naturally , i thought of him then and i thought of him again when it came to the play - off hole later			1
’ with three players in the eliminator chasing one place at @entity22 , @entity2 , 26 , chipped in from 20 yards to win it			1
‘ whether that had something to do with it i am not sure but i do feel that @entity3 is still there , ’ he said			1
‘ there will be times i think of him this week because i ’ve achieved the dream that we and so many other young golfers have			2
’ tinged with sadness : @entity2 's adventure will take place without his brother @entity3 who passed away in 2009 @entity2 was on a golf scholarship at @entity78 in the @entity79 — and @entity3 had already secured a place to join him there — when the accident happened on an a road in @entity84			1
‘ i actually had a really good summer golf-wise after he died , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ the two things i thought would be difficult , playing golf and sleeping , were actually not difficult at all , perhaps because they were both a type of escape			2
@entity89 took my mind off everything			0
‘ maybe it helped then and still does because if you miss a putt you realise there are much worse things in life that can happen			0
’ struggle : @entity2 , ranked 1,045 in the world , has also had to contend with the debilitating condition me getting to this point has been all the more difficult because @entity2 has also had to contend with the debilitating condition me			1
it has contributed to him not yet earning his @entity107 card and his current modest world ranking of 1,045			2
‘ i got glandular fever in the summer of 2012 and it seemed to stem from that , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ there are times when all you want to do is sleep , it was really bad for three months but at least i got to watch a lot of the @entity117			0
it has been a constant battle but the last six months have been much better			0
‘ there is not much you can do about it			0
i just try to eat well and boost my immune system as much as possible			0
’ @entity2 , who is attached to @entity123 and now lives in @entity124 , had world no 6 @entity43 among his practice partners yesterday			1
he enthused about the ‘ fantastic ’ week he is having in a rare break from the obscurity of the @entity129			0
his parents and grandmother will be there for what is sure to be a poignant few days			0
@entity2 cites his previous best career achievement as winning the @entity136 championship on the competitive @entity138 college circuit four years ago , so it will be a completely new experience playing before @entity10 ’s bulging galleries			1
‘ i ’ve got to look on it as a big opportunity for trying to get my tour card and try to treat it like any other event , ’ he said			0
‘ growing up , i have played a lot of links golf so the conditions are something i should be very comfortable with			0
’ right at home : the @entity152 grew up playing links golf so he is hoping to be comfortable in his surroundings 100 : it ’s exactly 100 years since @entity156 ( right ) won his sixth and final @entity22 , a record			2
£ 50 : the prize money won by @entity156 in 1914 — worth around £ 5,000 today			0
that ’s some way short of the £ 975,000 cheque the winner will receive at @entity10 on sunday			0
£ 5,400,000 : the total prize purse for the @entity163			0
a century ago it was just £ 135			0
zero : no player has ever won @entity22 twice at @entity10 , though @entity166 could become the first this weekend			2
one : @entity168 ’s @entity167 is the only @entity138 to have won @entity22 , and he did it at @entity10 in 1967			2
1930 : there is some hope for amateurs @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 this week			0
the last time an amateur won @entity22 was at @entity38 — @entity177 in 1930			2
22 : it ’s been 22 years since an @entity179 lifted the @entity9 — @entity180 triumphing at @entity181 in 1992			0
it ’s an even longer wait for an @entity179 champion at @entity10 — @entity184 in 1936			0
zero : bad news for the likes of champion @entity187 and @entity188 — a left - hander has never won @entity22 at @entity38			1
by @entity190 @entity191 aims to roar once more			0

@entity2 is currently not in the top 1,000 in the world rankings
