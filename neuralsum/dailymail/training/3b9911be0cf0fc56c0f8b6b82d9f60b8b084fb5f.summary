by @entity0 published : 03:29 est , 19 february 2014 @entity2 : 03:58 est , 19 february 2014 anger : the @entity4 was strongly criticised for agreeing to the wind farm plans the @entity4 has lost a @entity7 battle to allow an energy company to build a wind farm overlooking an @entity11 ruin on his estate			1
plans for four giant wind turbines to be built within half a mile of the @entity16 listed @entity18 lodge on his @entity20 estate in @entity22 were rejected as the site was deemed to be of ' international importance '			1
the @entity4 , 69 , a cousin of the queen and 23rd in line to the throne , had fought a long campaign against @entity30 , the @entity31 , and @entity32 , all of which voiced strong objections to the plans			2
developers represented in court by @entity38 , the wife of @entity40 leader @entity39 , had hoped to build a huge wind farm on the site , which would have been easily visible from the early 17th century lodge			1
the @entity4 , a former deputy chairman of @entity30 himself , had been strongly criticised for agreeing to plans put forward by @entity45			0
there were concerns that , had the wind farm been allowed , it could have set a precedent that put other country houses and historic estates at risk of similar developments			1
@entity53 , chief executive of @entity30 , told @entity54 at the @entity55 : ' we are very pleased that the @entity57 has underlined the vital principle of preserving important historic places like @entity18 , one of the most beautiful and unspoilt @entity11 landscapes in @entity62			1
' ' we have continued to argue that the original decision by @entity32 to refuse the application was absolutely right			0
the subsequent reasoning of the planning inspector did not pay enough attention to the significance of this exotic jewel in the landscape , ' he added			0
mr @entity53 went on to say : ' to allow turbines here would have had an appalling impact on a very special place			0
' historic : plans for four giant wind turbines to be built near @entity18 lodge on the @entity20 estate in @entity22 ( pictured ) were rejected as the site was deemed to be of ' international importance ' the @entity18 lodge was commissioned shortly before the death of @entity84 in 1603 by sir @entity85 - a prominent @entity86 whose son @entity87 was later involved in the @entity88			1
the building was never finished			0
@entity45 's plans to develop the site , which is on the edge of @entity93 , were originally rejected by @entity32 in 2010			2
a prolonged legal battle ensued , with the @entity96 ruling in favour of the developers			0
that decision was rejected in the @entity100 last year			0
now the @entity57 has upheld the @entity100 decision , although the @entity96 is entitled to launch another appeal .			2

@entity105 's cousin had agreed to four giant wind turbines on the historic estate
the plans would have left a @entity16 listed lodge overlooked by wind farm
@entity57 ruled @entity22 site had ' international importance '
it was commissioned in 1603 by *father* of @entity118 but not finished
campaigners said development would spoil the ' beautiful ' @entity11 setting
they were also concerned it would set a precedent for other historic sites
