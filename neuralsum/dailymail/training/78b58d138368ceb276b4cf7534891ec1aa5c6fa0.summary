@entity1 ’s @entity0 could get another chance to win the @entity3 , but they will have to do it in the blistering heat of @entity6 in 2016			0
as a test run for the real thing six years later , @entity6 is set to be chosen to host the inaugural veterans @entity3 in two years time and many of the players who played for @entity1 in 2002 , 2006 and 2010 would be selectable as over- 35s			1
organisers of the 16 - team tournament , @entity14 , have yet to confirm @entity6 as the venue but managing director @entity16 told the @entity17 in @entity18 this week that the @entity19 was the chosen location and @entity6 appears to be the favourite within that zone			2
the age limit on the 300 players expected to compete in the 2016 event would be 50 and the games are likely to last 35 minutes each half of a 10 - minute break			1

@entity60 , @entity63 and his brother , @entity71 , would also be eligible to represent @entity1			0
@entity6 are desperate to allay fears that they can not host a big football occasion and have already won the right to host the @entity76 supercup this december			0
the 2016 veterans @entity3 would will also revert to a simpler format with 16 teams in four groups of four , in stark contrast to @entity83 ’s 24 - team extravaganza to be played the same summer			0
@entity70 is another who could be eligible to take part at the veterans @entity3 in @entity6 in 2016 @entity23 , @entity1 's goalkeeper , could return and face his 2002 nemesis @entity70 once again @entity23 watches in disbelief as @entity57 's @entity70 scores during the @entity3 quarter final in 2002 the 16 - team tournament in @entity6 's soaring temperatures would be a prime test for the @entity40			1
