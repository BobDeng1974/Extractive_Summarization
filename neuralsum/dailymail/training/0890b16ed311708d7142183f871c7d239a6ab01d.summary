by @entity0 last updated at 4:56 pm on 6th september 2011 the @entity2 will ' significantly curtail ' public access to information , particularly about the private sector , campaigners have warned			0
the @entity6 has written to health secretary @entity7 outlining how the @entity8 will restrict access to information about the activity of private companies working under @entity14 contracts			1
while the @entity14 bodies commissioning services will be subject to the @entity18 , those bodies providing services will not , it says			1
freedom of information : a ward clerk files records at @entity23 , @entity24			0
campaigners say information about health practices will be more restricted under the reforms a commissioning body can demand information from a private company to help them answer @entity34 requests , but only on specific details already laid down in the contract between the @entity14 and the independent provider			1
campaign director @entity38 said : ' suppose there is concern about the use of potentially contaminated medical supplies by hospitals			0
' for an @entity14 hospital , the @entity44 could be used to obtain details of stocks of the product , the number of doses administered , the numbers of affected patients , the quality control measures in place ... ' this level of information would clearly not be available in relation to independent providers treating @entity14 patients			1
' this would represent a major loss of existing information rights			0
' it has come on the same day that professor @entity64 , chief executive of the @entity65 , has warned the health changes are ' high risk			1
' ' it 's a very complex set of charges , which are quite high risk in our view at a time where there are reall financial pressures in the health service , ' the health charity chief told the @entity78			1
he said the @entity14 faced a number of risks over the next two to three years as the bill would turn the health service ' upside down			2
' meanwhile , campaigners say @entity14 bodies could lose out to independent providers during the early stages of the reforms because they will have to disclose their track record on treating patients while independents will not			2
' @entity14 bodies would be forced to disclose any poor performance , while equally poorly performing independent providers may simply appear to have a blank sheet			2
' the principle of patient choice would also be undermined by such unequal disclosure requirements			0
' the campaign says independent providers should be subject to the @entity44 in the same way as the @entity14			2
otherwise , separate @entity34 requests would have to be made to each of the commissioning bodies with whom a provider has a contract			0
a request may then be refused on cost grounds , where the cost of investigating rises above Â£ 450 .			0

@entity14 changes are ' high risk ' , warns @entity65 chief
