a schoolboy who bravely tackled a knife - wielding pupil who was threatening a classmate was punished because such heroic actions are strictly banned			1
@entity4 , 13 , stepped in after he spotted an argument was quickly beginning to escalate between two boys at sir @entity8 school in @entity9 , @entity10			1
suddenly one of the boys pulled out a knife and began to threaten the other turning an scuffle into a potentially deadly situation			0
hero : @entity4 , 13 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , stands outside his school where he tackled a knife - wielding pupil - and was punished because such heroic actions are strictly forbidden the heroic teenager charged and tackled the knife - brandishing youngster into a wall sending both attacker and knife falling to the floor			1
but for his bravery the pupil received not a commendation but a stern telling off from staff for ignoring school rules			1
according to the @entity31 , @entity4 should have left the scene to find a teacher - abandoning the unarmed student			1
instead instincts kicked in and he chose to act - meaning there were no cuts , no stab wounds , and no need to call an ambulance			0
@entity4 said : ' he pulled out his flip knife so i came in and pushed him into the wall			2
' it was just to help the other kid so he would n't get hurt			0
' @entity4 's reward for his bravery was a day in the school office , removed from the other students , and a stern lecture about not playing the hero			2
' we 've taught him to do the right thing ' : briar with his mother @entity54 , who was furious when she learned her son was being disciplined for stepping in to help his classmate his mother @entity54 was furious at the dressing down			1
she said : ' i received a call from the school vice-principal indicating there was an incident at the school and that my son had been involved			0
' they my son was in trouble for being a part of it			0
' they told him they do n't condone heroics in the school and he was n't allowed to go back to class for the day			0
is n't that horrible ? ' we 've taught him to do the right thing and to step in - in our family we teach our children that they need to stand up for others and not run from danger out of self - preservation			1
' when did we decide as a society to allow our children to grow up without spines ? without a decent sense of the difference between right and wrong ? ' we 're coddling kids and that does n't make for strong individuals when they grow up - what are we teaching these children ? ' a spokeswoman for the @entity31 said details of the incident could not be discussed due to privacy regulations			0
but the @entity97 confirmed they were called to the school where a student had pulled a knife while fighting with another , and a third boy had intervened to disarm the student			2
the student with the knife has apparently been suspended and police are still investigating , meaning charges have not been ruled out .			0
