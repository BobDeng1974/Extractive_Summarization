by @entity0 one scientist has revealed the psychology of @entity3 on its 30th birthday - or @entity4 many of us have been guilty of wasting time playing @entity3 and finding ourselves unable to stop			1
and now one scientist has revealed the psychology of the popular game on its 30th birthday , 6 june - also known as @entity4			2
dr @entity10 said the game of tessellating bricks takes advantage of the mind ’s basic pleasure in tidying up by feeding it with a ‘ world of perpetual uncompleted tasks ’			1
over the last 30 years , people across the world have spent millions of hours fitting falling shapes into rows playing one of the biggest - selling computer games of all time			2
dr @entity10 , of the @entity28 ’s @entity27 explained that the chain of partial - solutions and the prospect of solving more mini tasks is as satisfying as scratching an itch			1
previous research has indicated that there are two ways of working out the puzzle – either by mentally rotating the brick in your mind ’s eye and imagining how it might fit into the line of blocks on the bottom , or by clicking to rotate the block quickly , so you can do a visual comparison			2
the study found that most people prefer to use the keys to rotate the blocks in order to work out where best to fit them , instead of imaging them turning			0
dr @entity10 thinks that one of the attractions of the game is that it is easier to think with it than about it , in what scientists call an epistemic action			0
he believes @entity3 proves that games can be addictive and immersive without having amazing graphics and realism			0
dr @entity10 , of the @entity28 's @entity27 explained the chain of partial - solutions and the prospect of solving more mini tasks in the game ( pictured ) is as satisfying as scratching an itch @entity3 also plays on the ' @entity73 ' , which shows that people more easily remember uncompleted tasks than those that they have finished			1
‘ @entity3 does this wonderfully … it presents a world of perpetual uncompleted tasks , ’ dr @entity10 said			1
‘ it shows how our minds are organised around goals and that our memory is not just a filing system where information is passively stored , but it adjusts dynamically according to our purposes			0
’ dr @entity10 thinks that the genius of @entity3 is that it takes advantage of this memory hook for uncompleted tasks			1
‘ it involves us in a compulsive loop of completing and generating new tasks and that keeps us endlessly playing			0
’ dr @entity10 said that @entity3 is the granddaddy of addictive puzzle games like @entity99			0
‘ @entity3 is pure game : there is no benefit to it , nothing to learn , no social or physical consequence			2
it is almost completely pointless , but keeps us coming back for more			0

a psychologist from the @entity28 has revealed @entity3 appeals to our brain 's *desire* to solve and tidy up mini tasks
the game is 30 years old today , also known as @entity4
previous research suggests that people most like to solve the puzzles by rotating bricks *feverishly* before placing in the best position
@entity3 plays on the ' @entity73 ' , which shows people more easily focus on uncompleted tasks than those which they have finished
