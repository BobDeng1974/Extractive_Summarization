by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 16:30 est , 6 may 2013 self - conscious : @entity2 experienced hair loss and was constantly tired designer and former singer @entity2 prides herself on her healthy lifestyle : she gets her five - a - day , eats oily fish regularly , does n’t drink or smoke and swims every day			1
she ’s also never ill , rarely even catching a cold			0
so , it did n’t make sense when a few years ago , @entity2 , 43 , started to feel permanently exhausted , her nails became brittle and her hair was getting thinner			1
‘ i was feeling awful all the time , ’ she says			0
‘ i had no energy and was dragging myself around			2
i often felt as if i needed a liedown during the day and was ready for bed in the early evening			0
i could n’t think why — i live a really healthy lifestyle			1
‘ i also felt really down and not myself			0
as i was only 40 , not an old woman , i could n’t work out what was going on			0
’ it was n’t only her lack of energy that bothered her — @entity2 , who has four children , also had fairly serious hair loss			1
this had started after the birth of her son @entity26 in 1999 when @entity2 was 29			1
‘ i really noticed it on the sides			0
in fact , i had a bald patch about 5cm wide on the left side near my temple , ’ says @entity2 , who lives in @entity27			1
‘ i would try to cover it with my remaining hair , but that was pretty thin , too			2
‘ it did n’t get any better over the years , and when i washed it , i could see handfuls coming out at once			0
‘ it became really noticeable that i had this bald patch and generally thinning hair			2
if i had something special to attend , i would wear a hairpiece that i would clip into the front or a fake ponytail			0
i even wore a hairpiece for my wedding			0
‘ when i did photo - shoots , they would automatically airbrush in extra hair , which was really embarrassing			1
‘ it does affect how you feel about yourself , ’ says @entity2 who is married to @entity53 drummer @entity52 and was famously once one of the @entity56 set , along with @entity57 and @entity58			1
@entity2 ’s thinning hair continued to distress her , but she did n’t see a doctor because she presumed nothing could be done			1
however , two years ago she sought medical advice about her fading energy levels			2
her gp took blood tests , which found an explanation for her problems : she was anaemic , but more significantly , she had an underactive thyroid gland			1
@entity73 , as it ’s known , is a common complaint , affecting at least two in every 100 people in @entity77 , though some experts suggest the figure could be higher as many spend years undiagnosed			2
living a fuller life : as well as her medication for hypothyroidism and anemia , @entity2 began taking a supplement for her hair loss and says she can see a difference already the thyroid produces the hormone thyroxine , which helps regulate the body ’s metabolism and other key processes			1
‘ if you have too little , the body ’s system runs too slowly			0
that ’s why people with an underactive thyroid gland tend to feel lethargic , feel the cold more , have low moods and are prone to putting on weight , ’ says @entity93 , a consultant ear , nose and throat and thyroid surgeon at the @entity98 and @entity99			1
hair loss is also common			1
this may be because the condition slows down the normal turnover of cells , which can include new hair cells			2
other symptoms include finding your mind works slower than normal , constipation , dry skin and brittle nails , palpitations , aching muscles and irregular or heavy periods			1
typically , it ’s caused when the body ’s own defences turn on it and produce antibodies to attack the thyroid gland			1
hypothyroidism is ten times more common in women , possibly because auto - immune conditions tend to affect more women than men			2
‘ the thyroid gland becomes inflamed and scar tissue forms , which means it is able to pump out less and less thyroxine , ’ says mr @entity93			1
some patients develop it as a result of damage to the thyroid following surgery or radiotherapy , or as a result of side - effects from medication such as lithium			2
childbirth can also be a trigger , because it leads to a brief time of having an over-active thyroid gland , which can damage the thyroid and eventually leave it underactive			1
‘ most people who go to their doctors complaining of tiredness will be given a standard battery of blood tests , which involves a test to check for levels of thyroxine [ also known as @entity161 ] and thyroid - stimulating hormone @entity163 , ’ adds mr @entity93			1
if it shows low levels , some doctors then choose to give patients another blood test that measures antibodies to the thyroid gland			1
if present , it shows that the antibodies have caused the problem			0
but not everyone who has the symptoms of low thyroid function gets a test			2
‘ the problem is that it ’s mainly women who are affected , ’ says @entity178 , chief executive of the charity @entity180			0
‘ women go in and the doctor says : “ of course you ’re tired and achy — you have young children			0
” then they go back years later and the doctor say : “ of course you ’re tired and achy — you ’re going through the menopause			0
” ’ the other problem is that women who have had an underactive thyroid may have low moods and sometimes doctors think they are just depressed			1
‘ we ’ve heard from women who have gone to their doctor and the doctor focuses on the low mood , ’ says @entity178			0
‘ actually , they are n’t depressed — their low mood is due to hypo - thyroidism , so they end up taking antidepressants unnecessarily			2
’ @entity2 , pictured with her model daughter @entity203 , experienced such severe hair loss she had a bald patch another complication is that people ’s needs for thyroxine differ			1
while some develop almost no symptoms even though they have low thyroxine levels , others have symptoms of hypothyroidism even when they are on the borderline of a healthy thyroxine level			2
once diagnosed , treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine tablets			0
when @entity2 was diagnosed , the doctor explained that as well as low energy and low mood , it could have explained why she had suffered a miscarriage three years earlier			1
studies have linked hypothyroidism to an increased risk of miscarriage			0
‘ at the time i was devastated , ’ says @entity2			2
‘ it also explained why i was struggling to lose weight			0
i had been really skinny , but had gradually put on a stone and could n’t shift it			0
’ ‘ levothyroxine tablets have helped my energy and mood no end			0
i felt like my old self again			0
but it did n’t do much for my hair			0
’ this could have been down to her anaemia as well as an underactive thyroid			1
anaemia is a key trigger for hair loss in women , says dr @entity246 , a hair transplant surgeon who works in @entity249 and @entity250			1
‘ i ask every woman who comes to me for help with hair loss to first have a blood test to rule out an underlying medical condition such as hypothyroidism , which could trigger it , ’ he says			1
‘ however , the most common cause by far to be picked up this way in women is anaemia			0
this is because iron is needed to help make protein and hair is essentially dead protein			0
’ a friend suggested @entity2 try a supplement called @entity266 , which contains iron , vitamin c , silica and a marine protein complex			2
‘ i started taking it only six months ago and my hair feels so much fuller , ’ says @entity2 , who is the mother of model @entity271 , 24			1
a multi-centre study suggested the supplement may thicken hair and reduce shedding			0
when 72 women with hair loss were given it or a placebo , those who had the supplement had reduced shedding and their hair shaft width increased after three months			1
the full study will be published later this year			0
meanwhile , @entity2 is happy to finally have ‘ everything sorted ’			2
‘ i do n’t feel like a tired old woman any more , and my hair no longer gets me down			0

despite a healthy lifestyle , @entity2 experienced *sudden* hair loss
she also suffered form lack of energy and brittle nails for no apparent reason
a test found she had @entity73 - an underactive thyroid gland
