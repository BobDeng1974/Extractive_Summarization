by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 04:11 est , 8 august 2012 tressed for success : @entity2 in a photoshoot to advertise a shampoo brand @entity2 rode tearfully into the sunset last night with her dream of a golden goodbye indelibly tainted by a final clash with her biggest rival			1
the @entity12 sensation added a silver medal to her 2012 and 2008 golds in front of a rousing crowd at the @entity17 – then began her retirement without wearing the crown of the most highly decorated woman athlete of all time			1
she failed to trounce her @entity23 arch enemy @entity22 – a win that would finally have laid to rest the controversy , competition and cat - fighting between them			1
@entity2 was disqualified in the first of three finals with @entity22 after making contact in the final sprint to the finish , a decision that filled the arena with booing and countless faces frozen in disbelief			1
she appeared to mouth ‘ she touched me first ! ’ as the judges huddled around screens and played the photo finish over and over again			2
then – clearly shaken by the referee ’s decision to relegate her – she was beaten to gold in the next race by a powerhouse performance from the 28 - year - old @entity23			2
but here ’s the good news			0
marketing experts said @entity2 could now earn £ 1million a year with deals promoting lifestyle , fashion and make - up , as well as earning up to £ 20,000 a time on the corporate speaking circuit			1
and her silver success yesterday – combined with another gold each for sir @entity58 and 20 - year - old @entity59 – also dramatically bolstered @entity61 ’s ever growing medal tally			1
whatever the result , the crowd still adored @entity64 , @entity64 , @entity64 ! this was @entity66 , a @entity67 for the people and one last hurrah for @entity70 @entity69			2
despite the disappointment , spectators gave a rousing , raucous send - off for the highest - profile female cyclist of all time before she effectively handed over the challenge to @entity59			2
holding her medal aloft , she waved farewell at precisely 6.40pm with the newcomer looking on			2
the @entity70 had stepped down			0
her appearance here in the last of the cycling events at the @entity83 will still go down as one of the most exciting finishes to an @entity12 race – and to a glittering career – ever witnessed			1
every lap @entity2 completed on the wooden track brought the crowd alive in an arena that is also known as the @entity92			1
every section she passed cranked the noise up like a bullet breaking the sound barrier			0
@entity2 failed to trounce her @entity23 arch enemy @entity22 - a win that would finally have laid to rest the controversy , competition and cat - fighting between them it came not just from the 6,000 - strong crowd or from her fiancé , family , or the impressive scattering of royal and @entity110 onlookers who clearly decided this was the one to watch			1
safe to assume it also came from the @entity114 ranks of an enormous tv audience around the world , and from a nation that has followed the 31 - year - old poster girl and magazine pin - up from the moment she took the @entity122 by storm			0
at one stage the cameras caught princes @entity127 and @entity128 leaping to their feet and @entity130 oh , how much more satisfying for @entity114 it would have been if the outcome had been that little bit different			0
@entity2 waves to the crowd after winning the @entity136 in the women 's sprint @entity137 @entity2 poses with her silver medal			1
but marketing experts said @entity2 could now earn £ 1million a year with deals promoting lifestyle , fashion and make - up this week @entity2 , who beat @entity22 in @entity143 and has repeatedly clashed with her since , took the opportunity to make public her views on the troublesome @entity23			1
in her sunday newspaper @entity12 column she wrote : ‘ we are not best mates			1
i would n’t necessarily want to hang out with her			0
she ’s not a bad person in any way			0
she ’s very determined , very @entity23			0
’ contrast that with her reaction when @entity22 snatched gold from her grasp just before 6pm yesterday			1
the @entity114 @entity12 track cyclist @entity69 pictured with her fiance and sports - performance scientist @entity157 beaten , disappointed and only just holding back the tears , @entity2 somewhere found the reserve to coast alongside her opponent and offer congratulations			1
it might have been last night of the @entity17 for @entity64 , but to the @entity23 , it was last night of the @entity166			1
first glory on this momentous session would go to @entity59 , the 5ft 4in pocket rocket from @entity170			0
‘ @entity177 ’ said the slogan on the @entity173 her family waved from the crowd at the half way line – and blimey , did she ever			0
then it was @entity2 ’s turn			2
but in the long - running saga of her epic battle with @entity22 , disaster was about to strike			2
by the time she stepped off her bike , she was in floods of tears			0
getting ready in her olympic 2012 kit , pictured left , and showing off her glamorous side in a @entity191 advert she now plans to start building a normal life with her fiancé @entity157 , the @entity193 sports scientist who broke a golden rule by falling in love with his charge and was effectively cold - shouldered out of the squad			0
they are set to marry next year			0
nor will she be short of an income			0
@entity191 hair product company has chosen her as the face of its pro-v ‘ smooth and sleek ’ range , reinforced yesterday with a photo of her in a figure - hugging dress			1
