by @entity0 published : 09:15 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 04:58 est , 22 august 2013 to head off unwanted advances , women should avoid an ' upward inflection ' when speaking , learn to accept compliments gracefully and imagine their grandmother was in the room during interaction with male colleagues			1
this advice does n't come from the pages of a 50s etiquette guide , but courtesy of an employee education and training service used by companies such as @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
the service responsible , @entity21 , recently published the article , entitled : ' what if a male colleague gets the wrong idea ? ' an employee education and training service used by the likes of @entity16 and @entity17 has published an article instructing women on how not to lead men on in the workplace and it 's enraged some women			1
writing on @entity35 , @entity36 , who spotted the feature , said : ' the problem with the piece - besides the fact that it treats its target audience like actual sex idiots - is that it once again implies that women are responsible for how men behave and what men think			1
' tips include avoiding ' revealing clothing ' and the manual states : ' if you ’re touchy - feely or flirtatious by nature , you might want to dial it back around him and any guys from whom you sense discomfort			1
' ' if you ’d feel embarrassed saying or doing whatever you ’re about to say or do in front of @entity57 , do n’t go there ' the article discusses how the way women dress can affect their position in the workplace : ' in a perfect world , women would feel free to dress however they want without being stigmatized for it			1
' ' know that revealing clothing and certain verbal tics , such as ending statements with an upward inflection in your voice or struggling to accept a compliment , can affect others ’ ability to take you seriously			1
' and apparently the greatest weapon a woman has against inadvertent flirting is her grandmother : ' do n’t say or do anything you would n’t say or do in the presence of your grandmother			2
if you sense that you could start unconsciously flirting ( you ’re human , and sometimes it happens ) , imagine that your grandmother is in the room			2
' if you ’d feel embarrassed saying or doing whatever you ’re about to say or do in front of @entity57 , do n’t go there			0
' and it even provides tips for when the male in question does n't quite get the hint			0
' if he still does n't get the message , socialize in groups , especially after hours and outside the office			0
the article states that revealing clothing can affect others ' ability to take you seriously ' there 's a greater chance that the guy will misinterpret your behaviour in 1 - on - 1 situations that happen outside the office			1
' leave when everyone else does			0
and try to avoid letting him pick up the tab			2
' the manual instructs women to use their ' creep - o - meter ' to determine whether the man is getting the wrong message			2
' always pay attention to your creep - o - meeter			0
if you get even a faint whiff of creepiness off of the guy or anyone else at work , ask yourself if it 's really worth trying to know the person			0
in most cases , it is n't			0
' it concludes with : ' still confused ? you should be			0
this is a confusing topic with a long , confusing history ' and then directs women to further reading material to help them ' delve deeper ' into the topic			2
@entity35 's thoughts on the subject were , however , more clear cut : ' unsurprisingly , a male equivalent ( how not to @entity144 ) does n't seem to exist ... men are not advised to keep their clavicles under wraps , lest their lady colleagues be driven mad with lust			1
' @entity150 , ceo and co-founder of @entity152 told @entity153 : ' we did not intend to offend or blame anyone with our recent article on gender relations in the workplace			0
' based on the thoughtful feedback we received , we are re-thinking our approach to this topic			0
' @entity153 have contacted @entity17 for comment .			1
