the drugging and sexual assault of a young @entity3 model was alleged to have occurred aboard a yacht moored at the island of @entity20 in the early hours of august 12 , 2008			1
a judge on the popular resort island quietly closed the probe in 2010 , citing a lack of evidence			0
however , a higher provincial court in the @entity27 , which include @entity20 , accepted an appeal by the plaintiff and issued an order in september 2011 instructing the same magistrate to resume the probe and question the prince as a suspect			1

he is a leading investor in both @entity41 and @entity44 's @entity43 media empire			1
the prince said the court 's final decision dismissing the allegations vindicates his argument that he was not even in @entity20 that day but rather in @entity50 with his wife , children , grandchildren and other witnesses			1
the court in @entity13 said the accuser 's version of events was riddled with inconsistencies in her several appearances to give testimony			1

rather , her lawyer did so much later			0
the court called this is a ' procedural anomaly that since then has tainted the entire investigation '			0

there is an arrow pointing to a man in the background , and the word ' rapist ' written there			2

' no one 's character should be subject to such dishonest attacks , ' the statement said			0
