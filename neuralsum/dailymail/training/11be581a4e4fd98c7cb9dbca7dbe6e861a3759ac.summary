mp @entity0 has warned energy watchdog @entity2 that it needs to ' get its act together ' energy watchdog @entity2 needs to ' get its act together ' to cut customers ' energy bills , mps have warned			1
in a scathing attack on the market regulator , the @entity7 and @entity8 said @entity2 has failed to stop big companies from charging too much , despite new price caps intended to curb costs			1
the committee said the new caps were too generous and that network companies – those responsible for the wires and pipes that distribute gas and electricity – had continued to make huge profits			1
at the same , performance targets are too low and consumers are having to wait too long to see if @entity2 is delivering savings , it said			1
@entity8 chairman @entity0 said : ' @entity2 's chief executive told us that we would have to wait eight years to see whether value for money was being delivered for bill payers			1
this is too long for hard - pressed consumers to wait			1
' @entity2 must get its act together and scrutinise these near monopolies more effectively			1
simpler charging methodologies are needed to strengthen the market 's ability to scrutinise costs and increase the pressure for greater cost - saving efficiencies			2
' barriers preventing smaller players from entering the market must be removed to drive down costs for consumers			0
' the so - called ' network costs ' currently account for around 23 per cent of a gas and electricity dual fuel bill			0
they are passed onto consumers by the energy suppliers , who are charged by the network companies for using their transmission and distribution infrastructure			1
in 2013 , @entity2 introduced a new price control system - known as @entity57 - which was designed to ensure that the costs of distributing and transmitting gas and electricity were competitive and profits were not excessive			1
but the committee said there was ' clear evidence ' that the network companies were making higher profits than expected			2
' this suggests that the targets and incentives set by @entity2 are too low , barriers to market entry are high and that @entity2 needs to monitor @entity57 more effectively and to equip @entity57 with stronger , corrective measures , ' it said			2
the @entity7 and @entity8 said @entity2 has failed to stop companies charging too much , despite price caps intended to curb costs of distributing gas and electricity ' while we recognise that the new @entity57 framework is an improvement on its predecessor , @entity2 has not yet created the conditions for the market to thrive and provide consumers with best value for money			1
' the committee also highlighted the complexity of the charging system			2
it said a combination of codes and regional charges across the @entity93 made it difficult to compare price and performance across network companies			2
it called on the government and @entity2 to conduct an in - depth study into the merits of replacing the current system with a standard national tariff			1
the price of oil has more than halved since last summer , while gas – the main source of electricity in @entity93 – has dropped by 29 per cent			0
but power firms have reduced their prices only modestly			0
@entity111 will cut its prices by 5 per cent at the end of this month			0
@entity114 has trimmed rates by just 1.3 per cent , while @entity116 has been ridiculed for refusing to introduce its 4.1 per cent cut until the end of april			0
@entity119 had pledged to freeze prices for two years if @entity121 wins power at the election in may			0
the policy has been widely criticised , and experts say many energy companies would have cut their tariffs sooner if the threat was not in place			0
critics have also warned that the move would sap investment from @entity93			0
last week , a report by the @entity134 said customers of the @entity137 energy suppliers are being overcharged by up to £ 234 a year for gas and electricity			0
ninety five per cent of the @entity93 's 19million ' dual fuel ' customers , those who get their gas and electricity from the same company , could have saved by switching , the probe found			0
despite this , half of customers surveyed said they have never switched , and a third said they had never even considered it or thought switching was impossible .			0
