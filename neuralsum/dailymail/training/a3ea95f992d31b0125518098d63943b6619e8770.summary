‘ double wife killer ’ @entity0 is fighting to keep a $ 1.5million life insurance payout from a policy taken out on his second wife , whom he is accused of murdering			1
@entity0 was charged with the murder of second wife , @entity7 , 51 , last november and police have reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife some 20 years earlier			1
both women died in ‘ freak ’ accidents to which @entity0 , 59 , was the sole witness			1
dr @entity16 plunged 140ft to her death shortly before her 12th wedding anniversary while hiking with @entity0 in a remote stretch of @entity20			1
@entity21 - his first wife - was crushed to death under the front of @entity24 when , he told first responders , the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark			1
in both cases @entity0 was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totalling $ 500,000 on the death of his first wife and $ 4.5million on the death of his second			1
the couple were married for 12 years and her life was insured against death when she feel 140ft and died in the @entity48			1
he claimed it was an accident scene : @entity51 in the @entity20 in @entity52 , where the couple were hiking at the time of the ' freak accident ' which claimed her life			2
he is now on trial for murder first wife : @entity0 and @entity61 on their wedding day			1
she died in what he said was a freak accident but his trial for the alleged murder of his second wife will hear claims the ' accident ' was also murder now court documents seen by @entity74 and filed as part of a civil case in @entity52 have revealed that @entity0 is fighting a case brought by @entity78 for a $ 1.5million policy taken out on dr @entity7			1
submitted to the court as @entity82 , the policy gives the reason for taking out such a substantial coverage as ‘ estate planning and income protection / planning to have children ’			0
@entity0 has not relinquished the claim he made in september 2013 , one year after his wife ’s death the previous september			2
he cited cause of death as ‘ @entity93			0
’ at the time of making this claim @entity0 was unaware that he was under investigation by the @entity96 who painstakingly scrutinized every aspect of the widower ’s life across two years before swooping and arresting him in november last year			2
but an autopsy carried out on dr @entity7 had already concluded that she ‘ died as a result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff ’			0
the manner of death was noted as ‘ undetermined , ’ by the coroner who stated : ‘ homicide can not be excluded			0
’ now , in its case against @entity0 , @entity78 has asked the court to decide what should be done with the $ 1.5million currently being held by the court			1
and shockingly , in a separate motion , court documents filed just last week show that @entity0 fought his late wife ’s family to have funds from dr @entity7 ’s estate released into his possession			1
as well as owning her own successful practice , ophthalmologist dr @entity7 had two further life insurance policies taken out in her name			0
last february the @entity124 of @entity125 , @entity52 found in her family ’s favor and barred @entity0 from accessing his late wife ’s estate on the grounds that allowing him to do so posed an ‘ imminent risk of substantial harm … to [ its ] financial interests			1
’ but newly filed documents reveal that @entity0 attempted to have these funds released into his possession as recently as december			0
he only finally failed in his bid last month , when a court denied him access to the funds , and demanded that he appoint a forensic accountant to detail the contents of his late wife ’s estate			0
last month @entity74 revealed that , in 2009 , @entity0 also took out a life insurance policy on his sister - in - law @entity144 who was married to his first wife ’s brother			2
verdict : @entity0 and @entity42 before her death			2
an autopsy carried out on dr @entity7 concluded that she ‘ died as a result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff ’			0
survived : @entity153 left behind a daughter , @entity154 , who was seven when she died			0
the $ 1.5 million policy at the center of the legal dispute was for ‘ estate planning and income protection / planning to have children ’			1
payout : @entity0 and @entity21 , whose death , supposedly when their jeep fell on top of her while jacked up , resulted in $ 500,000 in insurance payouts			2
it is not known if this is the car which claimed her life @entity144 was going through a divorce and ‘ concerned for her financial stability , ’ when she initially agreed to @entity0 taking out a policy that would pay $ 50,000 to @entity144 ’s brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $ 250,000			2
according to prosecutors in dr @entity7 ’s murder case , ‘ the evidence will show that @entity0 had a romantic interest in @entity21 ’			2
but @entity21 had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through			0
instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer			0
unbeknownst to her ‘ her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well , ’ with @entity0 making payments on the policy until december 2012 and listing himself as sole beneficiary			2
the policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that @entity0 had no insurable interest in @entity21			0
but the very fact of its existence raises the specter that @entity0 had @entity21 in his sights as a third potential victim			0
@entity0 was arrested on november 6 when @entity96 apprehended him as he returned home after dropping his nine - year - old daughter , @entity154 , at school			1
his indictment was the result of a prolonged investigation during which the @entity96 eavesdropped on his telephone conversations , combed through his finances , scrutinized his employment history and concluded that the ‘ freak ’ hiking accident that claimed the mother - of - one ’s life was murder			2
college days : @entity0 and @entity21 when he was a new geology graduate from @entity220			0
the couple moved to @entity52 , where after 12 years of marriage , she died in a ' freak accident ' , now said to be murder he was denied bail by @entity228 district judge @entity227 who described him as a ‘ danger ’ and said , ‘ there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second ’ and pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by @entity0 to his brother as suggestive that he was ‘ hiding funds			1
’ though @entity0 claimed to work as a fundraiser for a charity the economic crime auditor for the @entity241 found no evidence that the geology graduate from @entity220 had any earnings other than some in 1993 , 1999 and 2000			0
the only job he appears to have had was one briefly held in the petroleum industry – the job that saw him and his then new bride , @entity21 , move from their hometown of @entity254 , @entity220 , across the country to @entity52			0
the prosecution ’s case against @entity0 highlights the similarities between both his wives ’ passing – not least the substantial windfall both saw him set to receive			2
both ‘ freak accidents ’ occurred at remote locations with @entity0 the lone witness			1
both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and @entity0 told wildly varying stories about both deaths			0
prepared : @entity0 was said to have made nine different trips to the area around @entity270 in the summer before his wife died according to prosecution documents @entity0 even told a sunday school class that his first wife died of cancer and that she lost a baby she was carrying to chemotherapy			1
in the case of his second wife , two years before her death dr @entity7 almost died when she was struck by a wooden beam @entity0 had thrown off the deck of their cottage			1
after that incident @entity0 joked to friends , ‘ i was trying to kill my wife			0
’ investigators have also established that @entity0 ‘ extensively scouted ’ the fatal hike trail			0
contrary to what he told law enforcement he made nine different trips to the area around @entity270 that summer			0
the fortnight before their anniversary – the date of her death – @entity0 had hiked six trails to ‘ find the perfect one for the trip			0
’ and damningly a map found in his car showed the spot where dr @entity7 fell to her death , marked with a pink @entity303 in both @entity21 and dr @entity16 ’s deaths @entity0 was eager to have his wives ’ bodies cremated quickly despite family requests against it and , disturbingly , he spread both women ’s ashes on the same mountain near @entity311 , @entity52			1
a hearing for the civil case is scheduled for april while a trial date of may 4 -15 has been set for the murder case to which @entity0 has entered a not guilty plea .			1

@entity0 is charged with murdering his second wife in **criminal** trial which will also hear that he killed his first wife
both died in freak ' accidents ' to which he was sole witness and @entity96 spent months investigating second death before he was charged
court papers disclose he is trying to keep $ 1.5 million paid when second wife - dr @entity16 - plunged 140ft to her death in @entity48
civil case in @entity125 , @entity52 comes ahead of may **criminal** trial
