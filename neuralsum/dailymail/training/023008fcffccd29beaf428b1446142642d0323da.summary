but a horse is hardly the average household animal			2
yet mr @entity9 , a 28in - high @entity12 miniature , is right at home in owner @entity15 ’s one - bedroom flat			1
and there is nothing the three - year - old likes more than settling down to afternoon tea with playmates @entity20 , five , and her sister , @entity22 , two , the daughters of mrs @entity15 ’s business partner @entity24			0
cheeky : miniature horse , ' mr p ' spends so much time with people that he thinks he is human loyal : mr @entity9 follows owner @entity15 , 52 , everywhere			1
he is pictured even helping out ms @entity15 by helping with the shopping popular : mr @entity31 is treated like a local celebrity when he is taken for shopping trips along the high street mrs @entity15 , 52 , says her real - life @entity35 spends so much time indoors he thinks he is a human			1
‘ he ’s even taken on human characteristics			0
sometimes he ’s like a grumpy old man other times he ’s giddy like a child , ’ she said			0
‘ one day i caught him licking tea out of my mug , so i decided to brew him his own one and he wolfed it down			0
ever since i have given him tea and cake as a treat			0
