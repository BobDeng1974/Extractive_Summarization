@entity0 will need to improve in their next @entity2 games despite having ' genius ' @entity3 , coach @entity5 has admitted			1
@entity3 's scored a last - gasp winner to give @entity0 a 1 - 0 win over @entity8 on saturday and guarantee them progress to the knockout stages from @entity11 that was the four - time @entity14 winner 's second goal of the tournament , after he also scored the winner against @entity17 in @entity0 's opener			1
' genius ' : @entity3 was @entity0 's matchwinner again , but @entity5 is looking for improvement challenge : @entity5 wants more from his players after they only just managed to beat @entity8 1 - 0 @entity3 's ability to drag @entity0 to victory despite average performances in their first two games has drawn comparisons to @entity29 in 1986			1
and @entity5 praised his matchwinner from both games - but said @entity0 's other players must improve if they are to have any chance of realising their dreams of lifting the @entity2 in the @entity35			1
' we want to improve obviously , ' @entity5 said			2
' there are many things we have to think about and improve			0
' all players who played today have contributed to this victory but of course we have a genius who is called @entity3			0
everybody would have liked to have @entity3 but it is us who have him			0
' world class : @entity3 brilliantly curls home the winner with his left foot to save @entity0 's blushes wonder strike : @entity5 said two goalkeepers could n't stop @entity3 , so no wonder @entity56 struggled after a frustrating 90 minutes against the gutsy @entity57 , @entity3 broke the deadlock with a delightful curling shot in stoppage time to the delight of tens of thousands of @entity45 fans at the @entity63			1
' it was a very difficult match and @entity8 played a great @entity2 match			0
but that last play from @entity3 , no one could have stopped it			0
not even two goalkeepers could have stopped that @entity3 shot , ' @entity5 said			1
@entity0 , among the title favourites in @entity71 , played below par for the second consecutive game after narrowly winning their opener against @entity17 2 - 1			2
they may have secured qualification to the round of 16 but @entity5 , who had fielded an attacking formation with @entity80 , @entity3 , @entity81 and @entity82 , said they would analyse what had not worked that well , including breaking past the @entity57 down the wings			1
leaving the rest behind : @entity3 celebrates his goal , but @entity0 were underwhelming in @entity88 ' this sort of thing can happen , it should n't but it does , ' said the @entity45 , who won the @entity94 in the @entity88 stadium with @entity96 in 2009			2
' of course we always want to win , obviously , so we will try to strike a balance in the next games but it is not always easy , ' he said			0
' sometimes during counter-attacks we decide a match but today things got a little difficult with our counter-attacks , i want to congratulate @entity8 because they played a brilliant game			0
' team game : @entity3 and his team mates look relieved as they secured qualification from the group late on			0

not even two goalkeepers could stop @entity3 , @entity5 says
@entity0 have looked average so far but their star man has performed
@entity5 says they need to improve to have a chance of winning the *trophy*
