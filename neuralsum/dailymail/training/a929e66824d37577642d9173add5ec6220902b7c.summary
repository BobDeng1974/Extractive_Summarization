a congenital haemangioma is a tumour made up of thickened skin any many thin - walled blood vessels			1
they are unique because they are fully grown at birth , do not grow after birth , and many shrink much faster than haemangiomas			0
they may be diagnosed on a prenatal ultrasound			0
they are raised and usually pink to blue in colour with pale skin around them			2
they feel warmer to the touch than the rest of the body			0
there are two types of congenital haemangioma : a rapidly involuting congenital haemangioma ( @entity161 ) – this shrinks during the first year of life , and may be completely gone by 18 months old			1
non-involuting congenital haemangiomas ( @entity165 ) are fully developed at birth , and do not shrink			2
