a senior @entity1 nurse awarded one of @entity4 's highest medals for nursing on the front line has said she was unprepared for the horrific nature of the injuries she treated in @entity10			1
squadron leader @entity11 spoke movingly about the bravery of the 600 soldiers she brought back from the brink of death after fierce battles against the @entity17			1
but at a ceremony last week to mark the latest @entity19 for @entity4 's @entity20 , @entity21 – who was awarded the @entity24 2nd @entity23 – said no one expected such injuries , during the fighting in which 453 troops lost their lives			1
@entity21 @entity31 ' @entity30 ( left ) previously staff officer 1 of the @entity33 in @entity10 , with a colleague in an interview with the @entity37 the 40 - year - old revealed : from 2007 to 2013 , @entity21 , from @entity38 , commanded a medical response unit that flew by helicopter to the battlefield , braving @entity17 gunfire , to rescue injured soldiers			1
speaking about her ' horrific ' experiences in the war zone , she said : ' there was no training for the job and i 'd never done any pre-hospital care			0
' i was used to working in a nice emergency room in a safe environment with kit and with everyone on standby			2
' suddenly i was in a @entity57 helicopter , unable to hear myself think , treating guys with horrific injuries and being shot at			2
i was not prepared to see these injuries but then the military was not expecting to see them either			1
@entity63 ( left ) working onboard a @entity57 helicopter with a colleague on @entity66 : the codename under which all @entity4 operations in @entity10 have been conducted			1
she said she was a ' complete mess ' on returning to @entity4 after her first tour ' i pulled 600 patients from the battlefield – about 80 per cent of them had limbs missing or gunshot wounds			1
quite a lot died , especially those with gunshot wounds to the head and chest			0
' we also saw guys were dying because they were losing too much blood			1
' the officer , who enlisted in the @entity1 after completing a nursing degree , was first exposed to the gruesome reality of the @entity17 's tactics on christmas eve 2007			1
on that freezing day , her medical response team was sent on an emergency mission to rescue a young @entity90 who – on what was supposed to be a routine desert patrol in @entity93 – had stood on an enemy landmine			2
the force of the explosion blew off both his legs and his right arm			0
when the alarm was raised , @entity21 and her four - man team flew from @entity104 to where @entity105 , of @entity106 , had been horrifically wounded			1
@entity108 @entity105 , 24 , who had both his legs and his right arm blown off by an ied blast			2
@entity21 and her four - man team flew from @entity104 to help save his life he had suffered a catastrophic haemorrhage , yet the team had no blood or plasma to give him – because at the time medical helicopters did not carry these supplies			1
she said : ' i was gobsmacked – we all were			0
we 'd never seen anything like it			0
i mean , where do you start ? ' we had a reservist doctor with us who was supposed to lead the treatment and he just froze – literally for about five minutes he could n't move because he was overwhelmed			0
' so me and a paramedic took a deep breath and got to work on @entity105 as the helicopter flew back to @entity104			0
' we needed to get a fluid line into @entity105 but the veins in his remaining arm were flat			0
' our only option was to perform an intraosseous infusion , which means drilling through a patient 's bone to deliver fluids			0
fourteen of the service men and women recognised for gallantry and meritorious service in the @entity146 ceremony at @entity147 , @entity148			0
@entity21 @entity31 @entity149 is fourth from left ' our usual landmarks are through the arms and legs but , because of @entity105 's injuries , the only option was to go through a part of his pelvis called the iliac crest			1
' it is a nerve - racking procedure because you 've got a lot of vital organs in that area			0
' so that is what me and the paramedic corporal @entity166 did			0
he went in one side and i tried the other			0
eventually we got it right			0
' however , leading so many missions commanding the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) soon took its toll			0
@entity21 said : ' every time the red phone rang to signal another @entity33 mission i would think , ' is today going to be the day ? ' ' and when i came back to @entity4 after that first tour , i 'll be honest , i was a complete mess			1
' so i said right , we 've got to prepare our people better because i had n't been prepared and did n't want somebody else to go through it			0
' @entity4 soldiers with the @entity186 - led @entity185 ( @entity185 ) walk to a @entity57 helicopter in @entity93 in may 2008			1
from working in a ' nice emergency room ' @entity63 suddenly found herself in a @entity57 ' unable to hear [ myself ] think ' once home , she played a key role in setting up a @entity33 training programme , which used amputees in @entity4 to act as injured soldiers to help medics train before they were deployed to @entity10			1
as a result of recommendations from senior medical staff , blood and plasma started to be carried aboard @entity33 helicopters in 2008			1
but as the campaign continued , the @entity17 changed their tactics – leading to injuries becoming even more horrific and the experiences of @entity4 medics more traumatic			1
she said : ' originally they just wanted to hurt as many soldiers as possible in order to dent morale and get the public up in arms			0
' then they decided that if they maimed somebody really , really badly that 's going to affect people more and affect the minds of the soldiers on the ground			2
' so the blasts got bigger and the amputations started getting higher up the soldiers ' legs			0
this made our jobs a lot harder , especially when someone was bleeding from the groin because it is very difficult to stop that sort of bleeding			2
@entity17 fighters in the main bazaar of @entity236 in november 2001			2
ied blasts got bigger as the group moved away from seeking to hurt groups of soldiers towards maiming individuals as much as possible ' it was complicated , and i started to see my guys in the @entity33 teams burnout and leave			1
' at one point both the @entity33 teams were working 24 hours a day for ten days without a break			1
as i was the @entity1 's most senior nurse i had to take accountability , i had to make sure my guys were okay			1
' @entity251 – whose mother @entity252 was also a nurse – is married to surgeon lieutenant commander @entity254 , of the @entity255			2
she currently serves as a military nurse at the @entity257 in @entity258 , and is also about to start a phd in nursing studies			2
she added : ' the past seven years have been very difficult and i know my family have been concerned			0
' i got through it for a reason – because of the guys on the ground , the soldiers , who deserved the best			2
' their bravery was my reason for going back to the war zone so many times			0

squadron leader @entity11 spoke of soldiers ' bravery
senior @entity1 nurse said no one expected such traumatic injuries
@entity17 tactics *evolved* to try and maim individuals as much as possible
she was unprepared and fellow medics burned out doing 24 - hour shifts
for two years , @entity4 helicopters flew without blood or plasma on board to give to wounded soldiers - leading to deaths from losing blood
forty - year - old from @entity38 awarded the @entity24 2nd at the latest @entity19 for @entity4 's @entity20
no one anticipated the scale and severity of *casualties* the @entity17 could *inflict* ;
for two years , @entity4 helicopters flew without any blood or plasma on board to give to wounded soldiers – a *policy* that cost lives ;
*overworked* medics suffered ' burnout ' and quit their jobs after working 24 - hour shifts for ten days without any rest .
an earlier *version* of this *article* said @entity21 had been critical of military leaders over a lack of preparations for the conflict . we have been asked to point out that she made no such *criticisms* of the leadership .
