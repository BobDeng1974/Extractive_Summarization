by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the best basketball player in the world is up for grabs			0
after guiding the @entity6 to back - to - back @entity8 championships , there 's now a real possibility that @entity10 could leave south @entity11 for a new challenge this summer ... on a free			1
@entity10 opted out of the final two years of his £ 12.3million - a - year contract with the @entity6 to become an unrestricted free agent			1
the 29 - year - old was joined by @entity16 and @entity17 , the other two members of @entity6 's big three			1
could you even begin to imagine such a situation in football ? just think of the shockwaves that would be send through the football world if @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , for example , all decided to opt out of their @entity31 contracts and be open for all			1
and what about from @entity31 's point - of - view ? to see three core members of a team leave without a penny in return			2
it 's a striking situation , but one the @entity6 are faced with			0
the spine of their back - to - back championship winning team are now exploring other avenues			0
what 's brought about this change ? losing to the @entity57 in such a one - sided @entity59 series , and the realisation that the @entity6 were no longer top dogs			0
@entity6 were well beaten , their hopes of three titles in a row dashed , and they recognise they need to strengthen to compete for another championship next year			2
spine : @entity10 was joined by @entity17 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) in opting out of his @entity6 contract glory : @entity10 has won two @entity8 titles with @entity6 , but may leave in a quest for more homecoming ? one option for @entity10 is a return to his first team @entity75 , who drafted him in 2003 @entity77 opts out of @entity6 contract just because @entity80 have opted out of their contracts , it does n't mean they will be leaving @entity6 this summer			1
one possible scenario could be that @entity10 , @entity16 and @entity17 agree between themselves what contracts they want next season , and how much of the salary cap that @entity8 teams have to abide by ( which will rise to around £ 37million next season ) they chew up			2
but , @entity10 might choose another avenue in a quest for more titles			2
in 2010 , he had the big decision to leave the @entity75 , the team that drafted with the no 1 overall pick in the 2003 draft , to join @entity6 and it has turned out to be the right decision			2
but @entity10 wants to be able look back at his career with more than two @entity8 titles to show for it			1
the great @entity101 won six titles with @entity103 and @entity104 is a five - time champion with the @entity105			1
those are players that @entity10 compares with but , at the moment , his trophy cabinet is considerably smaller			0
the greatest : @entity101 won six @entity8 championships with his dominant @entity103 team modern day legend : @entity104 is a five - time @entity8 champion with the @entity105 @entity112 - £ 61.65m @entity113 - £ 46.97m @entity10 - £ 42.45m @entity27 - £ 37.99m @entity104 - £ 36.11m should he decide to leave @entity6 , @entity10 could hit the @entity114 and join the @entity115 , teaming up with @entity116 at the @entity117			1
will the city be big enough for both him and @entity104 ? then there 's @entity103 , who are looking to rebuild their franchise , the opportunity to link up with fellow free agent @entity124 at whichever franchise they feel like , or maybe even return to his first team and go home back to @entity129 by rejoining @entity75			1
teams can officially negotiate with @entity10 from july 1 , and not sign him before july 9			0
just imagine if the summer transfer window opened , and @entity27 had a choice of any club in the world			0
that is the situation @entity10 finds himself in			0
he is an athlete at the peak of his powers both on the court and in terms of financial power ( he was rated as the third highest paid sports star behind @entity112 and @entity113 in 2013 ) , and now he has his future in his own hands			0
that is the situation every sportsman dreams of .			0

@entity10 is a free agent after opting out of @entity6 contract
29 - year - old is free to sign for whichever team he wishes
@entity10 is a two - time @entity8 champion with @entity6 , but could leave in a quest for more titles
imagine if @entity27 found himself in the same situation
