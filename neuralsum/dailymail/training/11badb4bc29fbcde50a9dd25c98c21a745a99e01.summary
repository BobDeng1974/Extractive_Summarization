the decision is likely to raise questions after the team managed only a 1 - 1 draw - losing out on two vital @entity13 points - in a lacklustre performance when the game finally went ahead at @entity17 's @entity16 last night			1
the @entity4 players , some of whom routinely take caffeine stimulant tablets before matches , had been all set to take on the @entity7 team on tuesday night , but the game was postponed at the last minute because of a waterlogged pitch			1
blunder : @entity7 's @entity27 beats @entity28 to the ball to score the equaliser in @entity17 many players struggled to unwind after being poised to take to the pitch , and those worst - affected were given sleeping tablets			1
when the match went ahead last night @entity34 scored to give his team a first - half lead , but @entity7 's @entity27 equalised 20 minutes from time to bring the score level			1
the disappointing result raised questions over the impact taking sleeping pills can have on a player 's performance			1
but goalkeeper @entity28 was quick to take the blame for the scoreline , while defender @entity48 took to @entity49 to rubbish suggestions sleeping tablets had anything to do with wednesday 's result , posting ' what 's all the fuss with caffeine / sleeping tablets ? ? players have used them for yrs before + after games without any fuss ... ' @entity28 shouldered responsibility for @entity7 ’s goal after coming out to punch a corner , only to be beaten to the ball by centre half @entity27			1
‘ i came out and did n’t get there , ’ said @entity28			0
‘ it ’s my fault and that ’s cost us the three points			0
' @entity7 mastered the sodden pitch better than the @entity75 players , who looked to have suffered more from the disruption of the game being put back because of a waterlogged pitch			1
thousands of football fans who had travelled to eastern @entity80 for the game were left infuriated after officials ignored weather forecasts and chose not to close the £ 400million stadium 's retractable roof			1
heavy rain had been falling in the @entity7 capital for most of the day , but the roof stayed open and - after 45 minutes of deliberation - the game was called off			1
main man : @entity27 celebrates after heading home the equaliser for @entity7 against @entity4 the key @entity13 qualifying tie eventually went ahead last night , but players and fans will have been disappointed with the result			1
manager @entity98 said : ‘ i had the impression earlier in the week that the players were looking sharp and lively			2
i did n’t have that impression today			0
i do n’t know if that ’s due to the extra night , the sodden pitch or that we did n’t play well on the day			2
‘ there are days when you do n’t hit the heights			0
you just have to make certain you do n’t go away ruing that fact			0
a point in @entity17 is not to be looked down upon			2
’ @entity98 took his team for a walk and a stretch on wednesday morning and no - one tried to use the delay as an excuse			2
captain @entity116 questioned why the roof of the stadium in @entity7 was n't closed due to the weather ahead of the scheduled match on tuesday , but added that the players were ' at the top level ' and could n't use the delay as an excuse			1
' when you ’re fired up , pumped up and you ’ve had your massages and you ’re ready to go and then do n’t play , that ’s not ideal , ' he said			0
' but we ’re professionals			0
we ’re playing at the top level and we had to get ourselves up for this but i did n’t think we were totally at the races			0
‘ the pitch was slippy , wet and cutting up			2
i think it was laid a week - and - a - half ago			2
so it was n’t ideal			0
both teams tried to make the most of it and they did it better			0
opening salvo : @entity34 got his shoulder to the ball to put @entity4 in front in @entity17 ‘ the surprise was why they did n’t shut the roof the night before when it was raining			1
we get on with it			0
i wo n’t use the delay and conditions as an excuse			0
the reason we did n’t win was because we did n’t pass it when we went in front			0
’ the draw means @entity4 will be overtaken as group leaders if @entity154 beat @entity155 next month and manager @entity98 is looking for a big improvement when his side travel to @entity155 and @entity154 in march			1
he said : ‘ we did n’t play well			0
we ’ve got to be satisfied we came away with a point			0
we were fortunate to be 1 - 0 up at half - time because we had n’t played well			1
‘ the extra day and stay over , the sogginess of the pitch did n’t work in our favour			2
but we leave here with a point , on an unbeaten run , and hopefully we ’ll continue to progress and get the points we need			0
