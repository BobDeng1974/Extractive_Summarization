the gap between @entity3 boys and girls in school science performance is one of the biggest in the world , figures show			1
boys in the @entity3 are outperforming girls by 13 percentage points in international tests , while the average gap across other participating countries is just one point			1
author @entity15 , adviser to the government on girls , blamed sexism and poor teaching , telling the @entity20 : ‘ maths and science are a feminist issue			2
it is a myth that boys are better at them than girls			0
’ gap : @entity3 boys are further ahead of girls in science than in almost any other country ( posed by models ) physicist and tv presenter @entity31 said girls formed a ‘ great reservoir of untapped talent ’ but were getting the impression that science was ‘ male - dominated and not for them ’			1
the report , due to be published by the @entity39 next week , ranks @entity3 in the bottom five for gender equality in science , just above @entity41 and alongside @entity42			1
the gap in @entity41 is 18 points and the @entity3 is one of four countries with gaps of between 10 and 15 points			1
experts said the narrow gap in other countries proved that girls could perform as well as boys – but simply were not reaching their potential in the @entity3			1
support : tv science presenter @entity31 said girls formed a ‘ great reservoir of untapped talent ’ they said the tests suggested girls were being denied the chance to access to well - paid science jobs because they were being held back at school			1
in some countries in the rankings , including @entity66 and @entity67 , girls performed as well as boys in science or even better			2
pupils in 67 countries took @entity73 international tests in maths , science and reading at the age of 15			2
@entity3 boys taking part in the 2012 @entity73 tests did better than girls in maths by 12 percentage points , one point higher than the @entity39 average gap			1
girls meanwhile outperformed boys by 25 points in reading ; the @entity39 average was 35 points higher for girls			1
@entity91 , @entity39 special adviser on education , said there was ‘ no biological reason for girls to do badly			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s not the case that boys are good at science and girls at reading , that ’s just not true			0
people say boys are better at maths and science and girls at reading but there is simply no evidence from our research to support that			2
‘ aged 9 and 10 , both girls and boys in the @entity3 think science is really interesting ; by age 15 girls in the @entity3 think it is really boring			1
‘ the study choices girls are making do not lead to the best - paid occupations			0
too many schools are not giving them the answers to why are we studying this , what jobs will it lead to , what life opportunities it is opening up			0
' there is a lot of work to do in terms of attitudes , expectations and careers for girls			0
parents can play a part in tackling these social and emotional factors and so can teachers			0
’ experts said one solution currently under consideration is the introduction of ‘ gender policies ’ in schools which would challenge assumptions about suitable roles for girls and boys			0
they said phrases like ‘ man up ’ could be considered sexist but are often used by teachers and in the playground			0
a @entity154 spokesperson said : ‘ last year as many girls as boys achieved grade @entity158 and above in science gcses and the number of girls taking physics @entity162 has gone up by almost 1,000 in the last four years			2
in the same period , the number of girls taking biology and chemistry have also risen significantly			0
‘ developing the best schools and skills is a key part of our plan for education , and the skills taught by subjects like maths and science are some of those most valued by employers and universities			0

gap which has opened up in @entity39 rankings shows stark *differences*
@entity3 boys taking part in 2012 tests also did 12 points better in maths
tv physicist @entity192 : girls should not see science as ' male - dominated '
