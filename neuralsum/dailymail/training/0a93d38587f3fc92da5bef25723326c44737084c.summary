man with a plan : @entity2 arrives at @entity3 for a @entity5 meeting			0
a think tank said today his benefit reforms will work @entity2 ’s plan to persuade millions of people that working is more lucrative than living on benefits could succeed , @entity9 ’s leading economic think tank said today			1
reforms will widen the gap between wages and the income of people living on handouts , the @entity13 said			1
it added in its report that tax increases , benefit cuts and mr @entity2 ’s @entity27 system ‘ will strengthen people ’s incentives to work ’			1
a week ago the @entity28 condemned @entity27 as ‘ badly managed and over ambitious ’			1
but yesterday ’s report vindicated the reforms			0
the report said the complex changes will give the workless reason to seek a job and encourage those in jobs to work harder for promotions and pay rises			0
economists @entity39 and @entity41 said tax increases and benefit cuts will swallow more than £ 33million a year from incomes by 2015 , hitting those on benefits harder than workers			0
mr @entity39 said : ‘ the government ’s welfare reforms strengthen financial incentives to be in work , on average , more than offsetting the weakening caused by falling real wages			1
’ however , he cautioned that ‘ there is a huge amount of variation in these effects , with large numbers of people seeing big rises or big falls in effective tax rates			0
‘ changes in non-financial work incentives and in the perception of how the tax and benefit system works are also likely to be important , and are much harder to quantify			2
the overall effects of these changes on behaviour remains to be seen			0
’ the report said that chancellor @entity73 ’s changes to personal taxation will mean that taxpayers will have to hand over an extra £ 11 billion a year to the @entity76			0
cuts in benefits - including tax credit restrictions , cuts in @entity82 , and the ‘ bedroom tax ’ reduction in @entity84 for those in bigger homes - will amount to £ 22 billion , it found			0
the third major influence will be @entity27 , already in operation in test areas , which will cost the @entity76 roughly the same as the present cost of the six different benefits it is to replace			2
the overall effect , the @entity13 said , will be to reduce the average replacement rate , the difference between someone ’s income on benefits and their income in work , by 3.4 per cent			1
without the reform the figure would have gone up by 1.7 points , stripping income from people who work while making it more worthwhile to live on benefits			2
making work pay : the report said the complex changes will give the workless reason to seek a job and encourage those in jobs to work harder for promotions and pay rises mr @entity2 ’s @entity27 will give incentives to workless couples to get one person into a job , will help one - earner families more than two earner - families , and will give 1.5 million people who currently have little incentive to work income gains if they get jobs			1
the report said : ‘ benefit changes other than @entity27 are responsible for the bulk of the strengthening of incentives to be in work			2
‘ but the effect is less dramatic than might be expected given the scale of the cuts			0
incentives are strengthened much less for those with children than those without children			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity2 ’s @entity144 said : ‘ we are pleased that the @entity13 find that our welfare reforms will support people into work			1
‘ @entity27 will further increase work incentives , especially for those held back the most by the current system , and this will benefit families and the economy			2
’ @entity155 last night suggested the full roll - out of @entity27 could be delayed from its 2017 deadline after the criticisms it received from the @entity28 last week .			1
