by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 11:54 est , 2 october 2012 pregnant @entity1 just presumed she had a stomach ache while giving her eldest daughter @entity4 a bath one night			1
so the @entity6 25 - year - old from @entity8 , @entity9 , was shocked to find herself in labour four days earlier than expected ... and having to deliver the baby by herself on her bathroom floor			1
@entity14 : @entity1 , 25 , with @entity16 , the newest addition to her family , to whom she gave birth on the bathroom floor of her home in @entity22 , @entity6			1
miss @entity23 - whose partner @entity24 , 27 , was working late that night of 22 september - was bathing @entity25 , two , when she felt stomach pains			2
but within just 30 minutes she learned that it was not quite as simple as an upset stomach and had delivered her second child , @entity16 , weighing 8lbs 6oz , alone , while a shocked @entity25 sat in the bath			1
the new mother - of - two said : ' i spent all day cleaning , and scrubbed the bathroom from top to bottom			0
then when i was bathing @entity25 , @entity37 rang and i joked i might be having contractions because i had an upset stomach			1
' next thing i knew , my waters had broken , and by the time i rang @entity37 at 7.23pm , the baby had been born			2
' happy family : @entity1 and @entity45 with their children @entity25 , two , and baby @entity16 , one week			1
miss @entity23 said she had expected the birth of her son to be as painful as that of her daughter , but said there was no pain at all , just a stomach ache			0
she added : ' @entity37 , the paramedics and the midwife all arrived at the same time a couple of minutes later , and they cut the cord , checked us all over and said we did n't even need to go to hospital			2
they could n't believe it had happened so quickly			0
' @entity4 had been in the bath the whole time , and that kept me calm as i did n't want to upset her			0
she kept saying , " i 'll make you better , @entity67 ! i 'll make you better ! "			1
' and then when he was born , she said , " thanks for my brother , @entity67			2
thanks for the baby ! "			0
' big sister : @entity75 , two , with her new baby brother , @entity16 , who was born on the bathroom floor while she was having a bath			1
father - of - two mr @entity24 said : ' i was working late			0
whenever i 'm working a later shift i always ring @entity25 to say goodnight			0
when i rang at 6.55pm , @entity1 was bathing @entity25 and said she had a bad stomach			2
she made a joke about it being contractions			0
' then at 7.08pm she texted me and said i should come home			0
so i left work straight away and headed for home			0
then she rang and said her waters had broken			0
by the time i got halfway home she rang again and said he had arrived			2
' miss @entity23 added : ' we 'd like to thank the two paramedics and @entity95 , the duty midwife , who all arrived really quickly			0
they were great ! ' ' i 'll look after you , @entity67 ! ' @entity25 , two , tried to keep her mother @entity1 calm as she gave birth to baby @entity16 in the bathroom			1
@entity103 birth : it took @entity1 , 25 , just 30 minutes to give birth to @entity16 , who weighed 8lbs 6oz			1
all together : @entity106 and mum @entity1 with their two children , @entity4 and @entity16 .			1
