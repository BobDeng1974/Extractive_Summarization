mrs sales , who grew up in @entity21 and events competitively on her thoroughbred , said : ' toffee is part of the family and is so important to me , i even asked her permission to get married			2

mr @entity4 said : ' @entity3 goes to see @entity1 twice a day and will spend weekends with her , so i am always competing with her for attention			1
' from this neigh forward : newly - weds @entity4 and @entity43 with bridesmaids @entity1 and @entity11 tolerant groom : mr @entity4 is not quite as mad about @entity1 as his bride is - and the feeling seems to be mutual the couple , who are both metallurgists and met through work , have been together for five years - not a patch on the bride 's 13 years with @entity28			1
toffee was brought down from the coupleâ € ™ s home in @entity56 , @entity57 , for the service , and wore a purple bridle to match the other bridesmaid 's dress			1
