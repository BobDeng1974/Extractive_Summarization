when it comes to shaving , boys are normally taught the art by their fathers or older brothers			0
but this means bad habits can also be passed down through generations			0
now a principal scientist from @entity9 has revealed the science behind shaving including how hairs behave , why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never , ever tap your razor on the sink			1
she also settles the debate about whether you should go with , or against the grain			0
when dry , the hair is around 130 microns in diameter ( left ) but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns			2
washing the face before a shave increases the surface area the blades can cut through said @entity9 principal scientist @entity33 dr @entity33 has worked in the @entity35 area at the @entity36 in @entity37 for the past nine years			1
every morning 80 volunteers visit the centre and shave in front of a filming rig that combines magnifying lenses , high - speed cameras and special high - intensity lighting			1
this has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair , and in the case of multiple - blade models , the first blade pulls the hair up , the second cuts it , the third blade acts in a similar way to the first , and so on			1
in some of their products , @entity9 also offers a vibrate function that further lifts the hair and reduces the friction caused by the blades			1
this footage has also revealed the differences between dry and hydrated skin and beard hair			1
every day 80 volunteers shave in front of a rig that combines magnifying lenses and high - speed cameras			1
this has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair			2
in the case of multiple - blade models , the first blade pulls the hair up , the second cuts it , the third blade pulls and so on when hydrated , skin is also tighter ( an image of the skin is shown before washing left and after washing right )			1
this exposes more of the hair 's surface area to the blade			2
as a result dr @entity33 recommends showering before shaving - and not the other way round this image is a microscopic image of cut hairs on dehydrated skin			1
dry hair can have the strength of copper wire and when hair and skin hydrates it swells and makes the hair easier to cut			1
additionally , the lubricating ingredients in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin , improving glide @entity22 hairs are , on average , a tenth of a millimetre in diameter			2
when dry , the hair is around 130 microns but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns			2
this increases the surface area that the blades can cut through , and when hydrated , skin is plumper , which reveals more of the hair			2
before the shave , hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser : this softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it			2
apply plenty of shave gel : this provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother , more comfortable shave			0
shave with a multi-blade razor using light strokes : @entity9 said the razor should do the work , not the person shaving			1
change direction : begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain			2
make sure blades are not old or dull : the lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard			0
as a general rule if the razor begins to drag or does n't cut as closely as before , replace the blades			0
use aftershave : this can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin			0
many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection			0
as a result it makes more sense to shower before shaving and not the other way round			2
' allowing water to penetrate the hair is key for a comfortable and close shave because dry hair is difficult to cut , ' explained dr @entity33			1
' in fact , dry hair can have the strength of copper wire			2
when hair hydrates , it swells and becomes easier to cut			0
' so , men should wash the face and neck with a mild cleanser before the shave			2
or at least take a shower before the shave and not the other way around			2
' additionally , the lubricating ingredients formulated in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin , improving razor glide for a more comfortable shaving experience			0
' scanning electron microscopy also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek , neck and chin , for example			1
on the cheek these hairs resemble the shape of an egg , while on the chin they are wider on the underside than the top			0
the hairs of the neck look similar to those on the chin but are thicker and more robust			0
the skin on the cheek is also flatter than the raised bumps on the neck			0
this suggest that shaving in one direction on the cheek may not have the same affect when used on the neck , for example			0
however , dr @entity33 revealed that shaving in the direction of the hair is often the best place to start			1
' it is difficult to give a simple , straightforward answer , because the comfort of the shave - or lack of irritation - is dependent on so many more factors than simply the direction of the shaving stroke , ' she told @entity218 at the launch of @entity9 's @entity220 with @entity222 technology razor			1
' our data has shown that men who shave with @entity220 against the grain rated the product as high for ' gives a comfortable shave ' as those men who shaved with the grain and / or in both directions			1

dr @entity33 said : ' as a general rule , most men find shaving first in the direction of the hair growth and then following up with upstrokes provides the closest , smoothest shave with good skin comfort ' but she continued that a man 's facial hair tends to grow in different directions , so even if he thinks he shaves with the grain , some hairs will still unknowingly be cut against the grain			1
' as a general rule , i would say that most men find using light strokes and shaving first in the direction of the hair growth and then following up with upstrokes provides the closest , smoothest shave with good skin comfort			1
' and when it comes on what not to do , dr @entity33 said that some men place as much as 3.3lbs ( 1.5kg ) of force on the blade			1
' the closeness of the shave is largely determined by the quality and design of the razor , not by how hard you press , ' she added			0
' the best way for a close , comfortable shave is to use gentle strokes			0
the razor should do the work , not you			0
' dr @entity33 also explained that under no circumstances should a person tap their razor on the side of the sink			1
tapping the razor causes the precision blades to misalign which affects the cutting quality , but also how long the blades will last			0
this image shows the angle a blade takes on a typical cheek hair she also explained that under no circumstances should you tap the razor on the side of the sink			1

' at the end of the shave , just rinse the razor thoroughly with water and shake off excess water before storing , ' dr @entity33			1
and after the shave , dr @entity33 recommends using a moisturising lotion			1
' a good moisturiser will leave the skin soft and smooth and help to maintain the skin 's natural moisture barrier			0
' many aftershaves also contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection			0
this is what causes them to sting .			0

dr @entity33 studies the shaving habits of 80 men every day using high - speed cameras at @entity9 's @entity36 in @entity37
her footage reveals what happens as multi-blade razors move over hairs
scanning electron microscopy shows difference between dry and wet skin
the @entity9 scientist has also revealed the do 's and *don'ts* of shaving
she recommends **people** shower before a shave , and use light strokes
tests have shown **people** should start by shaving in direction of the hair
and razors should never be tapped on a sink under any circumstances
