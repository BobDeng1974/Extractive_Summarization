the @entity1 effect produced instant dividends for @entity3 as they sprung a surprise victory at @entity5 with a well - taken goal by @entity7			1
@entity1 , making his bow as @entity11 ’s assistant , heard his name chanted by @entity3 fans as @entity7 ’s 50th - minute winner exposed some uncharacteristic hesitation in the home defence			1
with both teams parading three signings apiece , there was plenty of optimism around at @entity5 at kick - off time			0
get in there : @entity7 celebrates opening the scoring at the @entity25 in front of the travelling @entity3 support fire power : @entity7 blasts home @entity3 's opening goal to put the visitors ahead in a tight clash at the @entity25 against @entity33 @entity33 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity34 6 – @entity35 6.5 , @entity36 7 , @entity37 5.5 , @entity38 6 – @entity39 6 ( @entity40 82 ) , @entity41 6.5 – @entity42 6 , @entity43 5.5 , @entity44 6 – @entity45 6 ( @entity46 70 )			1
subs not used : @entity48 ( gk ) , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52			0
@entity3 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity55 6 – @entity56 6.5 , @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 6 – @entity7 7 ( @entity61 82 ) , @entity62 7.5 , @entity63 7 ( @entity64 70 ) – @entity65			1
subs not used : given ( gk ) , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70			0
booked : @entity72 , @entity56 , @entity65			0
attendance : 27 , 478 particular enthusiasm was shown towards @entity42 , the @entity77 boy who has ended up at @entity33			1
he showed dazzling feet early on before sending a shot into the side - netting as home fans warmed to the football manager @entity54 is trying to play			2
@entity33 had the best of the early action with @entity3 prepared to put their foot in when necessary			1
@entity41 was painfully caught on the foot by @entity86 and @entity3 hard - man @entity56 , in his first @entity88 outing for 27 months , unceremoniously dumped one of @entity33 ’s debutants @entity45 on the turf			1
@entity3 gradually emerged from their early attacking slumber and should have nicked the first goal after 14 minutes			2
@entity34 and @entity38 left the ball to each other on the edge of the penalty area and @entity62 nipped in to square for @entity65			0
the striker should have buried the chance from six yards but mis - hit wide			2
he was so embarrassed he vainly claimed his muffed shot had taken a deflection and he should have a corner			0
@entity65 has pace and energy but went into yesterday having scored only one goal in 14 games			2
@entity3 were encouraged though and @entity33 needed their skipper @entity107 to be at his best			1
he blocked everything thrown at him , standing up tall to bravely get in the way of a shot @entity111			0
when @entity107 was breached , @entity34 saves with his legs from @entity63			0
at the other end , a late @entity33 rally before half - time saw @entity55 spill a shot by @entity35 and was relieved @entity57 managed to hack the ball away before @entity42 arrived for the rebound			1
within five minutes of the re-start , @entity3 were ahead			0
@entity7 scored well but in the @entity33 dug - out @entity54 would have been furious about how cheaply it was given away			1
dribbling away : @entity44 turns away from @entity121 as @entity33 attempted to exert their influence on @entity3 in the first half at the @entity25 first day in the new job : @entity1 was on the touchline as assistant for @entity3 and got animated over a decision that did n't go his side 's way on this occasion battle : @entity37 defends the ball from @entity7 as he tries to get the better of the @entity33 man on the edge of the @entity136 ' penalty area debutant : @entity42 was making his first appearance for @entity33 after moving from @entity77 but he could n't get the best of another debutant , @entity111 , here @entity141 miles @entity33 total 109.2 67.8 @entity41 90 12.0 7.5 @entity43 90 11.3 7.0 @entity38 90 10.6 7.0 @entity3 total 111.6 69.3 @entity86 90 12.1 7.5 @entity60 90 11.4 7.1 @entity62 90 11.2 7.0 @entity63 threatened danger with a neat turn on the edge of the box but when @entity37 blocked @entity7 ’s shot on the edge of the area , the danger should have been cleared			1
instead , @entity37 and @entity43 hesitated as if expecting each other to make the clearance or @entity107 to come across			0
@entity7 did n’t and belted a right - foot shot that seemed to go through @entity34 due to its power , though the goalkeeper will be disappointed not to have got some kind of decisive block			2
@entity3 ’s @entity159 forward celebrated enthusiastically in front of the travelling fans with good reason			2
he only scored once away from @entity163 throughout the whole of last season			0
the goal knocked the stuffing out @entity33 , who had confirmed the loan signing of @entity171 ’s @entity170 earlier in the day			1
their defender @entity38 ran into @entity7 and fell over claiming a penalty , which was correctly dismissed by referee @entity75			2
@entity58 went close to scoring a second with a header from a corner , and got a bloody nose as a result after accidentally banging into @entity63			0
@entity33 sent on big @entity46 for the last 20 but rarely threatened an equaliser			0
indeed , it was @entity3 youngster @entity181 who set up fellow sub @entity61 with a chance he hit wide			0
@entity33 's only serious glimmer came in injury - time when @entity57 made a late block			1
a tracksuited @entity1 kept popping out it in the second half , even choosing to exchange words with the fourth official over his award of a @entity33 free - kick			2
at least the result and performance of @entity3 ’s players should ensure they will escape the @entity1 glare in the next few days			0
having a blast : @entity7 struck with power to see the ball hit the back of the net and give @entity3 the lead in the second half at the @entity25 finish : @entity7 's shot finds its way past @entity34 in the @entity33 goal - although he ca n't be seen in this photo - and it puts the visitors ahead absolute scenes : the travelling @entity3 support go wild as @entity7 jumps up to celebrate his goal that made the difference for the men in claret and blue claret and blue hero : @entity7 raises his arms towards the fans as he waits for his team mates to come over and congratulate him ... top work : @entity62 and @entity56 get to the goalscorer first to give him a warm embrace behind the @entity33 goal @entity33 could n't stop @entity3 's flowing move for @entity7 's goal ... for more go to our brilliant @entity227 another first start : @entity62 is challenged by @entity39 as he made his debut for his new club on saturday afternoon on your back : @entity121 chases @entity38 as he attempts to rob the @entity234 of the ball out on the wing at the @entity25 new boys : @entity57 puts in a challenge on @entity77 boy @entity42 as he hits a shot across the penalty area done and dusted : @entity1 celebrates with the bench after the referee blows the full time whistle to tie a ribbon on @entity3 's 1 - 0 win at the @entity25 job well done : @entity62 waves to the fans after a successful debut while @entity111 offers his applause to the @entity3 faithful after his first appearance celebration : @entity55 toasts the win with a fist pump in front of the away support who were delighted with a win at a typically tough ground to go to			1

@entity7 scored the only goal to give @entity11 's @entity3 side a hard - fought opening day win

@entity7 's goal *sparked* wild scenes in the @entity3 end with some fans spilling onto the pitch
the visitors ended up *comfortable* winners as they saw out the game but still looked dangerous on the *counter* attack
