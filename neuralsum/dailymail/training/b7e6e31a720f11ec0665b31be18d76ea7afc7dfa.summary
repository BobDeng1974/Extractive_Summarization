‘ it ’s cash or nothing now , ’ explained briton @entity231 , who runs a pet grooming business in @entity233			0
‘ like lots of others i know who own small businesses , suppliers are demanding cash rather than post-dated cheques , which they have always been happy with in the past			0

i ’ll have to close down in a couple of days ; i ca n’t go on like this			0
