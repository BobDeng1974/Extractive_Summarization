mr @entity11 agreed with defence arguments that prosecutors failed to show mr @entity16 intentionally killed the woman			1
prosecutors claimed he drowned her for insurance money , but the only eyewitness testified that he thought mr @entity16 was trying to save the woman			1
the state 's evidence was ' sorely lacking ' and did not prove mr @entity16 had any financial motive , according to the judge in the trial in @entity54 , @entity55			1
' i do n't think anyone knows for sure what happened in the water down there , ' mr @entity11 said			0

' it should have gone to the jury for them to decide , ' mr @entity76 said of the judge 's decision			2
shortly after the death , mr @entity76 testified , his wife @entity122 was worried about mr @entity16 's condition			1
but evidence showed relations between mr @entity16 and his wife 's family frayed quickly as the @entity128 began having doubts about what happened and mr @entity16 started asking for mrs @entity23 's belongings			1

mr @entity11 described the claim as hearsay and said it would be inadmissible as evidence			0

the prosecution called the director of the funeral home which handled mrs @entity23 's death to testify that her husband had removed her engagement ring before she was buried			1
but mr @entity11 then ordered the jury out of the courtroom and proceeded to question the prosecutor 's argument that this showed a greed motive in the alleged killing			2
' you mean to tell me that [ @entity16 ] bought the engagement ring , married her , he and his family paid for a wedding , he planned and paid for a honeymoon halfway around the world , all so he could kill her to get an engagement ring he bought in the first place ? ' the judge asked			0
mr @entity11 's scepticism reflected the increasing fragility of the prosecution argument in the light of the failure to find a convincing motive for the alleged killing so soon after what seemed a harmonious wedding			2
@entity182 , a law professor at the @entity183 , said the judge 's decision to end the trial without the defence even presenting evidence was a ' serious indictment ' of the prosecution 's case , particularly considering it was a capital trial .			2

' hopefully he can put his life back together ' , says mr @entity16 's father
earlier mrs @entity23 's father was *barred* from testifying about life insurance
