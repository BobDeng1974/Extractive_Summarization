@entity1 president @entity0 insists he had nothing to do with the events that led to six players pulling out of saturday 's match against @entity6			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 withdrew from the squad on the eve of the trip to @entity16 citing injuries , prompting some accusations that the players had gone ' on strike '			1
the club released a statement on sunday evening looking to draw a line under the controversy which read : ' @entity1 wants to clarify that during the days leading up to the away @entity27 fixture at @entity6 on saturday april 17 that six first - team players suffered injuries			1
' @entity0 insists he had nothing to do with the events that led to players pulling out of saturday 's match against @entity6 @entity7 was among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by @entity6 and @entity0 , who has been banned since january after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in @entity39 , has now also distanced himself from any possible conspiracy theory , telling the @entity41 : ' i am not a coward and not the sort of guy who tells his players to go on strike			1
' i only found out on friday evening			2
i admit it looks weird			0
but if the players were injured , why did n't the manager inform the chairman ? ' this looks like a fight between manager @entity54 and the ownership of the club , which is not good			1
' @entity0 's ban and the injury controversy are just two of a string of chaotic events that have plagued @entity1 recently with @entity54 's position increasingly threatened over recent weeks @entity8 , @entity7 and two other @entity39 were among those who made themselves unavailable @entity54 has led the club to safety after taking over from ill - fated predecessors @entity68 and @entity69 , but he saw assistant @entity70 lose his job without warning on april 2 and his own deal , which expires at the end of the season , looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club 's current regime			1
the state of flux at @entity79 has led many fans to call for @entity81 to leave the club altogether but the @entity39 insists he still wishes to take the @entity82 forward			2
' from day one i felt i was at the right club , because i am more f * * * * d up than the fans , ' he said			0
' i am 58 and my dream is still for us to do something big here			0
i have asked permission to go to our last game of the season against @entity93 , a day before my ban ends			0
@entity95 celebrates scoring @entity6 's second goal during his side 's 2 - 1 victory against @entity1 the withdrawals , including @entity11 's , are the latest incident in another turbulent period at @entity1 ' if the fans want to kick me and shout at me , fine			1
i am used to it			0
' striker @entity7 used @entity104 to defend himself , as did goalkeeper @entity10 who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against @entity108 on tuesday night			2
however , @entity109 questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw			2
' in the old days you used to play with anything , cuts or one thing or another , ' he said			0
' the managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not			0
you did n't just come in and say ' i 've got a headache , i 'm going home '			0
i 'm sure with @entity122 or @entity123 , i ca n't imagine what would have happened if you 'd have done that			0
' @entity54 had a depleted squad to pick from when six @entity1 players pulled out at late notice			1
