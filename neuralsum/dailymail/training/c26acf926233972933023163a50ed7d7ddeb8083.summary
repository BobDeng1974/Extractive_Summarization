@entity18 has cut the size of its tubs of celebrations from 855g to 750g , which equates to a reduction of around 11 sweets compared to last year			1
at the same time , tubs of @entity26 ’s heroes are down from 800g to 780g , which equates to two or three fewer chocolate treats			2
the smaller sizes have not led to an equal reduction in the price with the result shoppers are being hit with what amounts to a stealth price rise			1
it comes against a background of rising raw material costs and is a pattern that has been repeated across a range of products from cheese to packs of nappies			1
one of @entity46 ’s foremost sweet and chocolate industry experts , @entity47 , said the pack reductions will not go down well with customers			2
mr @entity47 , the editor of @entity51 ’s @entity50 , said : ‘ sadly , reducing the size of the packets is now an unavoidable trend			2
’ he said shoppers do not have time to check the weight of packs during the hectic @entity14 shopping rush , which means they may well miss the reduction			0
@entity18 has cut the size of its tubs of @entity21 from 855g to 750g , which equates to a reduction of around 11 sweets compared to last year he said : ‘ i have five kids and they love celebrations			1
but , in effect , what @entity18 and @entity26 are doing to families is putting their fist in the tub , grabbing a handful and saying , ‘ sorry guys not those ones ’			1
‘ it ’s 105 grams less which is around 11 chocolates			0
i do n’t need to tell you the look you will see on my kids ’ faces if you were to take that many sweets away in one go - especially without telling them			0
’ he added : ‘ to win the trust of consumers , produces need to do the unusual thing and be accountable			0
they could at least say the three magic words - ‘ we are sorry ’			0

@entity26 defended reducing the size of its dairy milk and other products as a measure to help people cope with the cost of living squeeze a @entity18 spokesman said : ‘ like all food manufacturers , we have seen continued cost increases over recent years			1
we look to absorb the vast majority of these costs by being more efficient , but on occasion this is not possible			0
we always work hard to ensure we continue to offer our consumers great value for money			0
’ @entity26 has defended reducing the size of its dairy milk and other products with a similar statement , adding : ‘ making these small reductions allows us to hold prices at current levels - which is important for our customers in these difficult economic times			1
‘ we still believe our chocolate represents excellent value for money and remains an affordable treat			0
