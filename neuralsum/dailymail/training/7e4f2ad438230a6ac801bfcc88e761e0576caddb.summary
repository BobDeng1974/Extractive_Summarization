pain at the pump : january 's planned increase will cost the average family an extra £ 60 a year in petrol costs and could also see a 0.1 per cent cut in economic growth , a report prepared for @entity13 shows changing times : the rise and fall , and rise again , of petrol over the last five years as a result of the predicted job losses and damage to growth , the tax hike would only bring in just over half the expected extra tax revenue - £ 800million rather than £ 1.5billion , it said			1
the study , produced by the @entity37 , said cutting fuel duty by 3p instead of raising it by 3p would create 70,000 new jobs and boost growth by 0.2 per cent			1
it added that the 6p relative difference between the two options would normally have been estimated to have lost the @entity20 about £ 3billion			2
however , because of the boost to the @entity49 economy , that loss of revenue is much less - at £ 1.8billion			0
@entity13 will present the report when its leaders meet @entity20 officials in @entity53 this afternoon			1
warning : @entity2 has been told that raising fuel duty by 3p will lead to 35,000 job losses speaking before the meeting , @entity57 , national spokesman for @entity13 , said he believed chief secretary to the treasury @entity59 understood the problems faced by motorists			2
mr @entity57 said : ' we have always argued that fuel duty should n't be the @entity20 's sacred cash cow - it should be used as a lever for growth			2
' and we 've proved our argument with robust financial research and modelling that shows if you raise duty you destroy jobs and damage growth			0
' @entity59 understands this critical point and is one of the few politicians who 's actually listening to the facts and engaging with our argument			0
' we appreciate the government 's aspiration to reduce the deficit but know that hiking fuel duty up by 3p in january will only make things much worse			0
' a @entity20 spokesman said : ' it is right that the @entity20 engages with @entity13 to discuss technical issues around the impact of the cost of fuel on the economy			0
' what matters to motorists and businesses is that fuel is now 10p a litre lower than under the previous @entity80 's plans			0
this government has done more to support motorists and businesses than any other			0

increase will see a 0.1 per cent cut in economic growth , report warns
fall in household spending will lead to lower ni and ' loss of 35,000 jobs '
