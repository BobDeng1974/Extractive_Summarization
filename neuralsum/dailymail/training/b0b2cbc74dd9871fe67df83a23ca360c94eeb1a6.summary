planning a weekend break ? if so , the chances are you have already wildly underestimated how much your trip will cost			1
in fact , a new survey has revealed that @entity7 tourists overspend on @entity9 city breaks by more than double what they had initially planned			0
according to travel search site @entity11 , @entity7 typically budget 65 per cent less than the total spend they are likely to need for a weekend break in @entity9			1
but in some cases such as travelling to @entity16 or @entity17 , they blow their budgets by more than double what they had planned			0
the study looked at the total cost for a two night break for two people , staying in a four - star hotel in ten of @entity9 's top holiday cities			1
the survey found that total costs , including flights , ranged from £ 500 for a trip to @entity31 to over £ 900 for a weekend in @entity16			1
the average cost of a city break was found to be around £ 700 per couple			1
alarmingly @entity34 perceived the cost of a trip to @entity31 to be around £ 380 , and the price of a trip to @entity16 £ 460			2
@entity34 are also confused as to which cities offer the best value for money , believing @entity17 to be the cheapest , when in fact the study found it was the third most expensive option			0
the survey revealed that the total cost was around £ 400 more than @entity34 expected			0
the study also found that @entity48 and @entity49 were perceived to be the most expensive , when in reality they are the third and fourth cheapest cities in the study			0
the new guide from @entity11 has now calculated the total cost for two people staying in each of the top ten cities , @entity17 , @entity31 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity16 , @entity48 , and @entity49			2
it also breaks down the cost for each element of the trip including flights , accommodation in a four - star city centre hotel with breakfast , entrance to a top tourist attraction , sightseeing bus tour , dinner and beer			0
the breakdown costs for each city highlights that a cheap flight does not necessarily equal a cheap break			0
in some cases , such as @entity57 , taking a slightly more expensive flight is still worth it as the other costs when you get there are so much cheaper			0
while @entity31 offers the cheapest beer , with an average cost of £ 1.14 a bottle , @entity16 was the most expensive , costing on average £ 6.03 a bottle			1
@entity11 's @entity89 said : ' as our guide shows , a cheap flight does not necessarily guarantee a great value city break – two return flights can be under 30 percent of the total cost , as is the case with @entity16			1
' it 's therefore important to consider all your city break costs and we hope that this guide provides clarity for travellers so that planning and budgeting for a weekend is as easy as possible			2
