' the learned judge conducting the trial saw very clearly what you did			2
‘ it ’s incomprehensible that a man of your age and experience should behave in such an appalling way			2
it is inexcusable and reprehensible and you have no one to blame but yourself			0
‘ the very fact there are no comparable cases shows how rare , if not unique your case must be			0
