the @entity1 's full and final findings on the state of the planet 's climate have been published global warming is unequivocal and human influence has been the dominant cause since the mid- 20th century , according to the @entity8 ( @entity8 )			1
the @entity8 's full and final findings on the state of the planet ’s climate have been published and the report , which was put together for the @entity1 , says that limiting climate change will require ‘ substantial and sustained ’ reductions of greenhouse gas emissions			1
the findings of the report , which includes the comment that global warming is ' almost definitely ' caused by humans , were approved by the member governments of the @entity8 in september			1
the final version has now been released to provide detailed information to policymakers and the scientific community			0
the @entity25 has 1,500 pages of text , 600 diagrams , cites 9,000 scientific publications and claims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the physical science basis of climate change			1
‘ the report provides information about what has changed in the climate system , why it has changed , and how it will change in the future , ’ said @entity33 , co-chair of @entity35 i. it says that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases , already at levels not seen in at least 800,000 years , will persist for many centuries and ‘ continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system ’			1
@entity53 the @entity54 reported revealed that it is ' extremely likely ' that human activity is the dominant cause for global warming			2
it claims a rise in temperature in the @entity60 ( right ) will cause snow cover to decrease by 25 per cent by the end of the 21st century			0
but the report failed to conclusively explain why the rise in global average surface temperatures had largely ' paused ' over the past two decades ( left ) the high latitudes and the equatorial @entity67 are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation by the end of this century ( right )			2
in many midlatitude and subtropical dry regions , mean precipitation will likely decrease from the 1986 - 2005 period ( left ) since the publication of the @entity8 report , more @entity73 than ever before believe that global warming is n't happening			1
the @entity78 study , which was published last month , found the number has risen to 23 percent , up seven percentage points since april 2013			0
the latest survey , taken in november 2013 , finds that the majority of @entity73 — 63 percent — do believe in climate change , and 53 percent are ' somewhat ' or ' very ' worried about the consequences			0
the researchers also say @entity73 believe that even if it exists , global warming is not their problem			2
' over years of research , we have consistently found that , on average , @entity73 view global warming as a threat distant in space and time – a risk that will affect far away places , other species , or future generations more than people here and now , ' the report says			1
' we still find this same pattern , in which fewer than half of @entity73 ( 38 % ) believe they personally will be harmed a ' moderate amount ' or a ' great deal ' by global warming			1
the report highlights a number of doomsday scenarios , including extreme storms , heat waves , rising sea levels and the melting of @entity114			0
among its findings are that sea levels have risen by 19cm since 1901 and are expected to rise a further 26 - 82cm by the end of the century			0
but it concedes that world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years , despite growing amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere			1
temperature rises have dropped from 0.12 ° c per decade since 1951 to just 0.05 ° c per decade since 1998			0
this slowdown has been seized upon by climate sceptics who claim carbon dioxide is not as damaging as has been suggested			0
@entity8 scientists , however , believe the pause is temporary and a return to ' substantial warming ' is expected in coming decades			2
perhaps most controversially , the report it says that humans are between 95 per cent and 100 per cent to blame for the warming of the planet since the mid @entity138 and this level of certainty among scientists is a boost from the 2007 report , which said that global warming was ‘ very likely ’ to have been caused by humans			1
‘ human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean , in changes in the global water cycle , in reductions in snow and ice , in global mean sea level rise , and in changes in some climate extremes , ’ says the report			0
@entity159 concentrations have increased by 40 per cent since pre-industrial times , primarily from fossil fuel emissions , claims the @entity8			2
the ocean has absorbed about 30 per cent of the emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide , causing ocean acidification ‘ this evidence for human influence has grown since @entity168 ( the last @entity8 report )			1
it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid- 20th century , ’ it adds			0
an ‘ atlas ’ of global and regional climate projections is included in the final version of the report , which contains a series of maps showing temperature and rainfall estimates for 35 regions of the world			2
in order to show the way drafts and reviews of the report were put together , the @entity8 has also released all of the 54,677 comments by experts that informed the final version			1
scientists claim that global average sea levels will continue to rise during the 21st century under all temperature scenarios presented in the report			0
they say it will ' very likely ' exceed that observed during 1971 - 2010 due to increased ocean warming and loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets			0

finalised version of the @entity1 's @entity8 ( @entity8 ) report has been released
@entity207 of 1,500 pages of text , 600 diagrams and cites 9,000 publications
warns @entity159 has reached levels *unprecedented* in at least *80,000* years and scientists are 95 % certain that man is to blame for global warming
concedes that world temperatures have barely risen in past 15 years
