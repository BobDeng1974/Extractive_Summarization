in his darkest moments , he said , he thought of ending his life			0
' it got to be that bad			0
' @entity1 is one of several players in a federal lawsuit filed last month in @entity29 that accuses teams of dishing out powerful drugs to keep players on the field despite injuries			1
he is also part of a class - action lawsuit which the @entity14 has agreed to settle for $ 765million without admitting it hid the risk of concussion from players			1
@entity1 , 54 , spoke about his struggles with dementia and depression with a small group of reporters , including @entity47 sports writer @entity46 , yesterday			0

it was only five years ago , after x-rays and an mri , that doctors told him he had broken his neck at some point			1

' for over 40 years [ the @entity14 ] have continuously and fervently denied that it knew , should have known or believed there to be any relationship between @entity14 players suffering concussions while playing , the @entity14 policies concerning tackling methodology , ' the complaint says			1
it adds that evidence showing concussion causes the brain condition amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been readily available ' for more than 100 years '			0
the complaint notes that the most dangerous tackles - where players used their heads as a ' weapon ' - were outlawed in the late 1970s			2
but it adds that the laws were not well - enforced , saying : ' the @entity14 wanted to keep its fan base excited by the visual exhilaration witnessing such hazardous techniques			1
' despite the @entity14 â€™s knowledge of such dangerous practices and the increased risk of head injury to the players , the @entity14 turned a blind eye for decades			1
