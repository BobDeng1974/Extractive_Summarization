he clutches a glass of the homemade illegal brew in the clip , which also shows a stash of drink bottles , biscuits and crisps on a window ledge , before it was shared with friends on @entity22			1
@entity7 was jailed for life with a minimum of 13 years after he used a broken champagne bottle to stab @entity39 , 26 , in @entity41 's nightclub in the @entity42 in december 2006			1
the music producer collapsed and died after the attack , where witnesses described seeing the young father being held with his arms behind his back before he was stabbed in the chest			2
@entity51 - born @entity7 , then 23 and living in @entity49 , north @entity50 , made his getaway in a @entity53 before fleeing to @entity54 and then @entity55 , @entity56 , before he was extradited back to @entity57			1
the 50 - second video clip was captured on a banned mobile phone and shared with friends on @entity22 @entity51 - born @entity7 will spend a minimum of 13 years behind bars for the stabbing of @entity39 , 26 mr @entity39 was looking forward to the birth of his second child with fiancee @entity65 , who he already had a daughter with , when he was killed			1
the @entity67 launched an internal investigation at the category c prison , which houses 500 inmates , and dealt with those involved			1
a spokesperson from the @entity73 said : ' all identified prisoners have faced disciplinary action			2
this type of behaviour will not be tolerated			2
' @entity7 wears a grey vest as he dances around the prison with another inmate , who wears sunglasses the footage also shows a stash of drinks bottles , crisps and biscuits being stored on a window ledge the video has outraged members of the public after it was shared on social media			1
@entity93 , wrote on @entity94 : ' i think it 's disgusting the stuff they can get up to in prison these days			1
i 've seen other ones of take aways and stuff like that			2
' they are there to be punished not rewarded			0
if they have it soo cosy they will never learn from there 's mistakes [ sic ]			0
' @entity111 added : ' what 's more shameless is that it 's the authorities allowing the " party " to take place			0
' others described it as ' shocking ' and ' disgraceful '			0
@entity7 ( left ) stabbed @entity39 , 26 , ( right ) with a broken champagne bottle at a @entity50 nighclub in december 2006 prison officers at @entity12 in @entity13 reportedly turned a blind eye to the partying , which happened in the run up to @entity35 in december last year prison inmates use the yeast food spread to make illegal hooch dubbed ' @entity127 ' behind bars prisoners are infamous for brewing illicit alcohol while they 're behind bars with the @entity133 concoctions carrying a variety of names from ' pruno ' to ' hooch '			1
but it is perhaps surprising to learn how inmates are able to make the beverages on such a limited amount of resources			0
in 2009 it was reported that @entity143 had been banned from @entity144 in @entity145 because inmates were using it to make super strength hooch			0
dubbed ' @entity150 ' , prisoners added it to fruit , vegetables , bread and water , with the yeast in the food spread triggering the fermenting process of turning the sugars in the fruit into alcohol			0
the brew is then left over two weeks in old soft drink bottles or plastic bags before it is strained with a t - shirt or sock to remove the remains of the fruit and veg			2
it was also reportedly being used at privately - run @entity170 in @entity171			0
@entity172 , or prison wine , is renowned for being made by inmates because it can be produced with the limited selection of equipment and ingredients available to them			2
it is usually made using a variation of apples , oranges , fruit cocktail , candy , ketchup , sugar , milk , and possibly other ingredients , including crumbled bread			0
again , the use of a plastic bag , hot running water and a sock are needed during the fermentation process			0
the longer the concoction is left the stronger it will be with the alcohol volume ranging from 2 per cent to 14 per cent .			0
