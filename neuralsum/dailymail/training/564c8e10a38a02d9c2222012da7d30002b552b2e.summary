by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is set fulfil his boyhood dream of playing @entity4 against the club he left earlier this summer			1
in an ironic twist of fate , the @entity7 will face @entity9 on the opening day of the season			1
@entity2 made the move to @entity4 , the club he supported as a boy , from @entity14 's in a £ 4million move earlier this month			1
in signing for @entity4 , @entity2 said : ' i ca n't believe it , i 've loved this club all my life			1
i left here 17 years ago - and i have n't stopped loving it since			0
' i have always dreamt of playing for @entity4 , but i did kind of think the chance of playing for them had gone			0
i did n't think the chance would come			0
' i know how big @entity4 are - and it means everything to me - but i know what is important ; i know it 's what i do on the pitch and the minutes i play			2
' i know that 's what matters , and that 's what i 'll be focused on			0
' the fairytale scenario for @entity2 would be to score in on his @entity23 bow against his former club			2
but with either @entity45 or @entity46 likely to occupy the lone striker 's role on the opening day of the season , it remains to be seen whether @entity2 will feature against @entity52 's men			1
however , should the @entity54 international score , he will join an illustrious group of @entity4 strikers to have scored on their debuts for the club			2
proud : @entity2 said he could n't believe he 'd signed for his boyhood club @entity4 @entity45 v @entity60 ( @entity61 ) - january 6 , 2013 having joined from @entity63 , the striker made an instant impact by scoring on his debut in the @entity61 third round clash against @entity60			1
he then scored on his league bow , netting in the 2 - 1 defeat at @entity69 before scoring again in his next game against @entity71			0
first goal : @entity45 scores on his debut against @entity60 in the @entity61 in 2013 @entity46 v @entity74 ( @entity75 ) - february 2 , 2011 having arrived from @entity76 for £ 22.8million , much was expected of the @entity77			1
and he delivered instantly , scoring on his debut against @entity74 as the @entity7 ran - out 2 - 0 winners			0
he has n't stopped scoring since			0
debut : @entity46 scores the first of many for @entity4 against @entity74 in the @entity75 in 2011 @entity84 v @entity83 ( @entity85 ) - august 9 , 2006 a few eyebrows were raised when @entity87 forked out £ 6million to sign the temperamental @entity88 , but it looked money well spent when he scored on his debut to help @entity4 to victory against @entity83 in a crucial @entity85 qualifier			1
opener : @entity84 ( left ) and @entity94 ( right ) celebrate the former 's debut goal for @entity4 @entity98 v @entity97 ( @entity75 ) august 7 , 1999 arrived at @entity99 from @entity100 as a relative unknown - but announced himself with the winner against @entity97 at @entity103 before scoring nine more goals that season			1
debut : @entity98 scored against @entity106 wednesday on his first game for @entity4 in 1999 @entity109 v @entity97 ( @entity75 ) august 19 , 1995 the pressure was on having arrived from @entity111 for a then @entity113 transfer record fee of £ 8.5million			1
and the former @entity54 international delivered scoring a brilliant winner to secure an opening day win for @entity118 ' side			2
kop : @entity109 ( front ) celebrates with @entity121 after scoring for @entity4 , as he did in his first game @entity121 v @entity123 ( @entity124 ) sept 22 , 1993 the @entity4 legend , as you 'd expect , scored on his debut as the @entity23 beat @entity123 3 - 1 in the @entity124 at @entity128			1
@entity121 then scored all five in the second leg at @entity99 a week later to truly announce himself on the big stage			0
shot : @entity121 bags his first goal for @entity4 against @entity123 in the @entity124 - all the way back in 1993 @entity133 ( @entity75 ) may 6 1997 with @entity4 needing victory to stay in the title race and 2 - 0 down at @entity137 , @entity118 threw on a 17 - year - old striker from the academy			1
@entity140 made an instant impact by halving the deficit - but he could n't prevent his side from falling to defeat at @entity144			0
first : a young @entity140 scores against @entity137 in 1997 - his first of many for @entity4 @entity148 v @entity147 ( @entity85 ) - august 15 , 2007 this was n't his debut , but his first start			2
having come on for 10 minutes in the 2 - 1 win over @entity153 a few days earlier , @entity87 handed to @entity154 his full debut in the @entity85 qualifier against @entity147 - and @entity148 scored the winner			0
and he scored in his next two , as well			0
@entity159 v @entity158 ( @entity75 ) - august 14 , 2004 arriving with a hefty £ 14million price tag , @entity159 failed to find the net on his full debut which came against @entity162 in a @entity85 qualifier - but he did score on his league bow , notching in the 1 - 1 draw against @entity158			2
@entity168 v @entity167 ( @entity75 ) - sept 14 , 2002 with just two brief substitute appearances under his belt , the @entity170 striker christened his first star with a brace against @entity167 at the @entity175 in a 3 - 2 win			0
@entity178 v @entity177 ( @entity75 ) - sept 15 , 1996 having caused a stir at @entity180 , much was expected of the @entity170			0
he failed to find the back of the net coming on as a late substitute against @entity9 to make his debut - but he scored twice on his first start at @entity187 and followed up that brace with two more against @entity63 the week after in a 5 - 1 win			0
on the hunt : @entity2 can add his name to the record books should he score in his @entity4 debut			1

@entity2 could open @entity4 account against @entity9 on the opening day of the new @entity75 season
