by @entity1 reporter a key component of anti-ageing creams is next to useless , research suggests			1
some moisturisers use fatty shells called liposomes to ferry wrinkle - busting compounds under the skin , where they can fight the ageing process			2
but a study carried out by @entity14 researchers , published in the @entity15 , found that rather than passing through the skin the liposomes break into pieces almost as soon as they make contact			2
new research suggests a key component of anti-ageing creams does not work professor @entity21 , of the @entity22 , said : ‘ the skin ’s task is to block extraneous substances , which is why it will generally reject anything that tries to penetrate it			1
‘ so it is no easy task for the beauty industry to find methods of transporting rejuvenating and moisturising substances deep into the skin			0
‘ we have now shown that liposomes can not do the job , despite some rather persistent advertising claims			0
’ the @entity40 for @entity41 and @entity42 carried out new tests of the abilities of liposomes			0
scientists say liposomes - an ingredient in anti-wrinkle creams - are unable to get into skin and break on the surface using a method called @entity52 - they monitored what happens to liposomes as they enter the skin by marking them with fluorescent colour			1
if , under the @entity52 system , the colours are seen to show ‘ concerted ’ movement as the liposomes contact the skin , then it means the liposomes remain intact as they penetrate it			0
but , no such movement happened , which , according to the researchers , proves that liposomes do not remain intact and so do not penetrate the skin as beauty firms claim			1
professor @entity21 added that liposomes may still work , but not in the way manufacturers believe .			0

liposomes often *contained* in anti-ageing creams
manufacturers claim they carry anti-wrinkle ingredients under skin
research by @entity22 says skin rejects them
