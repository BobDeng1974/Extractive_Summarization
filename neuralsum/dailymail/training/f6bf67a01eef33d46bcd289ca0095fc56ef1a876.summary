too often it seems he is willing to subscribe to a worldwide view that is predicated on appeasing our adversaries while shunning our friends , ' said @entity35			0
@entity1 , speaking publicly for the first time since the attacks against his nomination began , sought to set the record straight , assuring the panel that he backed @entity14 policies of preventing @entity17 from obtaining a nuclear weapon and supporting a strong @entity75			2
allies : @entity1 , who is expected to eventually be confirmed , appeared with two former senators - @entity8 @entity78 of @entity79 and @entity81 @entity80 of @entity82 ' no one individual vote , no one individual quote , no one individual statement defines me , my beliefs , or my record , ' @entity1 said at his confirmation hearing			1

@entity1 hit a potential landmine when , responding to a question from @entity82 senator @entity112 , he said that @entity17 's government both elected and legitimate			1
@entity1 was reponding to a question about why he voted against declaring the @entity17 @entity116 a terrorist organization when he explained that the @entity14 had never before given that designation to a wing of a ' legitimate ' government ' when i say legitimate , it does n't mean we disagree with @entity17 , but it is a member of the @entity124 , almost all of our governments have embassies in @entity17 , so that 's why i note an elected , legitimate government , ' he said			1
president @entity2 himself has questioned the fairness of elections in @entity17			0
the nation 's @entity134 leaders have the power to disqualify any candidates on religious grounds and brutal tactics have been used in the past to suppress protests			0

' @entity147 later ' clarified ' his statement , saying he meant to say that the @entity17 government is ' recognized			2
' another member of @entity2 's second - term national security team , senator @entity152 , sailed through his nomination hearing before receiving the @entity7 's overwhelming support on tuesday			2
but @entity1 , who broke with his @entity8 party over the @entity157 , found a much more confrontational panel			2
beyond tough questioning on @entity75 and @entity17 , he was also was grilled on his view of the @entity58 budget - @entity1 is known as an advocate for tighter spending controls			2
the lone @entity8 in the entire @entity7 , which would vote on @entity1 if he is cleared by the committee , only one of the 45 @entity8 - @entity167 's @entity166 - has said he backs @entity1			1
@entity1 , backed by the @entity169 and @entity58 , has been on a charm offensive to win over recalcitrant senators since @entity2 nominated him this month to replace outgoing defense secretary @entity173			0

most observers expect @entity1 will be confirmed by the committee , even if he the vote breaks along party lines at 14 democrats to 12 republicans			0
@entity219 control 55 seats in the full @entity7 and can approve @entity1 with no @entity8 support , but they will need some backing from @entity1 's party to overcome procedural hurdles that could stop the nomination .			1
