in - form @entity2 forward @entity115 was his side 's standout player and set - up @entity29 's goal @entity125 - @entity12 : 5 has to take responsibility for the fact @entity2 simply did n’t turn up in the first half and played so cautiously			1

@entity0 - 8 what a day for the little @entity97			2
he produced a composed finish to put @entity1 ahead and a spectacular one for the decisive second goal			2
