@entity0 can also provide data on ' long balls ' , a pass aimed for a pitch position or 2nd ball rather than a specific player			2
@entity7 have taken the long - ball route even more seriously under @entity9 this season			2
in stats provided by @entity0 , it shows that the @entity14 side have attempted 1,696 long passes after 22 games this term - 358 more at the same stage last season under former boss @entity19			1
in fact , only @entity20 - who spent around the £ 8million mark last summer as opposed to @entity7 's £ 150m spree - have attempted more long balls ( 1,737 ) in the top flight this season			1
@entity9 ( right ) was left with plenty to ponder after his @entity7 side were held @entity29 @entity30 ( left ) and @entity31 were unable to find a way through against the @entity34 side @entity35 exchanges words with @entity38 boss @entity37 , whose side are third in the table for long balls that comes as a surprising revelation considering @entity35 has spoken in frustrated terms on various occasions when his team , in his words , have been forced to retreat to a long - ball game against sides who have used that tactic against them			1
following @entity7 's win against @entity37 's @entity38 side earlier this month he said : ' in the first half we played like @entity38 and that 's not good			0
' you have to play like we usually play with the ball on the floor			0
' most recently after the @entity61 stalemate against @entity29 he told mutv : ' i was very disappointed at half - time because we made the same error against @entity67 and @entity38			0
' we played in the same style of play [ as the opposition ] and you do n't have to do that			0
' @entity38 , @entity73 and @entity74 are the other sides which make up the top five for attempting long balls this season			0
@entity78 ( right ) rises highest to head home for @entity74 against @entity80 earlier in the season @entity81 - picturing challenging for the ball with @entity83 - has been a vocal point for @entity38 this term @entity35 is not a fan of @entity7 playing long ball football - yet they are the second highest team in the @entity88 to do so this season @entity89 ( centre ) has impressed for @entity20 this season - the team who have attempted the most long balls			1
