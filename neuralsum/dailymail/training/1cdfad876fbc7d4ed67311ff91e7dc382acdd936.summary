by @entity0 it is the dead of night on the edge of the @entity3 , and the sun is about to kiss the horizon			1
much of @entity6 may be sleeping , but 20 minutes past midnight represents the limit of the sun ’s descent on this clear june night			1
in an hour , the sky ’s amber glow will be supplanted by beams of white light which last for nearly 24 hours in summertime			1
the villages are silent and the roads dead – except for a faint , rolling mass of mist , which drifts over from the wetlands , across the tarmac and down the hill towards the cliffs and the north @entity23			2
on the road to the end of the earth : @entity6 bathes in an ethereal light in high summer i am in a minibus , having taken a 40 - minute flight from @entity31 to the tiny city of @entity33 on @entity6 ’s northern shore			1
my stomach is swimming with coffee – an insurance policy against the lateness of the moment			2
for i am here to explore @entity6 ’s wonders while the rest of the world sleeps – to see what the witching hour looks like when the sun never sets			1
welcome to the white nights of northern @entity6 : the land of the midnight sun. road to somewhere : the @entity52 ' runs around @entity6 , linking the remote north to @entity31 @entity54 , a little science : our planet ’s 23 - degree tilt robs the polar extremities of that which most of the world takes for granted : the continuous , inevitable oscillation of night and day			1
for those countries at the northernmost and southernmost edges of the globe , summer is a season of unremitting exposure to the sun. at the @entity70 , it does not set for six months			1
instead , it steadily spirals higher above the earth , before eventually beginning its descent and disappearing for the rest of the year			2
and even though @entity33 lies 60 miles below the @entity3 , it too experiences one near - endless day that stretches from the earliest minutes of june to the dying embers of july			1
@entity79 – the son of a generation of farmers from nearby @entity82 , and my guide through this twilight realm – is accustomed to the unbroken light			1
a place lost in its own little realm : the fishing town of @entity33 sits on @entity6 's northern shore ‘ it is no problem for me , ’ he says , as he steers the minibus out of @entity33 , and across the dam that bridges the noiseless fjord			1
‘ i sleep with the curtains open – but i bet you will find it strange			2
my wife is from @entity101 and she ca n’t sleep			2
’ it is 10pm , and we are driving east			2
the road climbs above the fjord ’s eastern shore , passing a steaming stream of hot water			2
then , through lengthening purple shadows , it crosses lava fields towards the cloud of spray on the horizon			2
it is among the most spectacular of @entity6 ’s waterfalls			1
today , it is raging			2
in the depths of winter , its 12 - metre - high torrents are frozen solid			2
but beneath the midnight sun , the snow atop the mountains is finally melting – rolling down the valley in a tumult of sound and spray			1
in - mid june , the waters are at their most ferocious			1
halting above the horizon : during june and july , the sun does not set on @entity6 it was in this maelstrom , in around 1000ad , that modern @entity6 was born			1
until @entity135 the island had been an empty rock at the top of the world , uninhabited for 17million years			2
explorers knew it was there , but believed it to be the domain of diabolical dog - headed people			2
perhaps unsurprisingly , the rest of the planet stayed away			2
when the first settlers eventually arrived , they brought arguments about power , wealth and religion – and , by the turn of the 11th century , civil war between pagans and @entity149 looked inevitable			0
only when the chief ‘ law - speaker ’ @entity157 – a pagan – converted , was conflict averted			0
on his way home from the parliament of elders which passed for rule in @entity6 at the time , he neared the waterfall – and cast his abandoned idols into its depths			1
thus the name : @entity116 , the @entity172			0
we leave the road at @entity116 , and turn north to race the sun towards the horizon			1
taking a shine to the surroundings : @entity0 glimpsed the midnight sun from the very northern edge of @entity6 @entity79 takes us over lava fields where astronauts once trained for the moon landings , through the fishing town of @entity185 – now sleeping in the midnight gloom			1
then we reach the cliffs at @entity188 , just in time to see the sun lower its brow to meet the ocean			1
it is twenty past midnight			0
puffins nesting in the rocks sleep without murmur , and the only movement is the bobbing head of a seal , emerging intermittently at the foot of the cliffs			0
from the edge of the sheer drop to the black sand at the water ’s edge , there is a near - unimpeded view to the @entity3			0
the only distraction is the faint blur of the island of @entity211 on the horizon			0
this lost outcrop is @entity6 ’s most northerly point – home to just 100 people and a million sea birds			1
roar : legend has it the @entity116 waterfall was created when an @entity6 leader cast away his pagan idols legend insists that it was created by three nocturnal trolls who were trying to split @entity6 in two			1
they were ( for reasons that remain unclear ) cutting a trench between the mainland and the northwest peninsula , but were so focused on the job that they forgot about the rising sun – and , as dawn turned red , were turned to stone			1
the female troll , realising too late their mistake , flung her shovel in anger , and it landed in the ocean , becoming this new island at the world ’s end			0
there are many of them up here			0
@entity6 is a country of myths and legends , of giant trolls , ghosts and @entity255 ( secret people ) who are believed to live in the lava fields – mischievous souls who dislike crosses , churches and electricity , and who can wreck construction projects if their homes are disturbed			1
the more scientific narrative of @entity6 ’s formation is only a little less fantastical			1
it sits on the junction of two tectonic plates – the @entity271 ridge – meaning that at certain points you can stand across continents , with one foot in @entity275 and one in @entity277			1
geysers snort from beneath the surface , steam belches from the earth , and , in the hills above @entity82 , the eggy smell of sulphur hangs in the air			0
caught in an unusual light : during high summer , the @entity6 sunshine plays tricks on the camera volcanoes , extinct and idle , dominate the landscape , and the scars of their fury are everywhere			1
we drive east past huge tears in the soil – fractures of earthquakes past – and then , after 30 minutes , approach the horseshoe - shaped , 1km - wide canyon of @entity302 , the product of a catastrophic glacial flood just 3,000 years ago			0
or if you prefer the legend , from the hoofprint of @entity309 ’s eight - legged horse			0
@entity302 is the capital of the @entity255 – who supposedly live in the cracks in the 100m - high cliffs			0
their queen dwells in the rocks at the canyon ’s head , but only emerges when its waterfall flows			0
this early morning , it is bathed in sunlight			0
but there is no water			0
from the peaceful emptiness of @entity302 , we turn to the roar of @entity328			0
the biggest waterfall in @entity277 , it is often cast as ‘ @entity331 ’ to @entity116 ’s ‘ beauty ’			1
fire in the sky : in such light , it is easy to believe in the idea of @entity6 as home of the mischievous ' @entity255 ' it is easy to see why			1
this is a monster waterfall			0
it is approaching 5am when @entity79 pulls the minibus up the dirt track to the car park			0
we are cold and tired			0
but we drag ourselves across black rocks and look down on an almost impossible volume of milky - white water , which plunges 50 metres into a burst of spray			0
there are no handrails , and you can stand scarily close to the torrents – almost dizzy at the power of the water			0
we linger , staring , until we feel the sun returning to full - strength			2
then it is back to the bus for another shot of caffeine and the long drive home			0
across the island , everyone is just waking up			0
they missed quite a show			0
