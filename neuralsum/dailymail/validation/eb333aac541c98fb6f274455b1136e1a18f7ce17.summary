@entity0 admitted on tuesday that it may take big - money summer signing @entity3 one year to adapt to life at @entity5			1
the former @entity7 midfielder has suffered a severe slump in form after a bright start to life at @entity11 and was even hooked at half - time by the @entity5 boss against @entity14 last week			1
@entity16 's man in @entity7 @entity17 , who kept a close eye on @entity19 during his four - year spell in the @entity22 capital , assures @entity5 fans the £ 60million man will come good			1
@entity3 was substituted against @entity14 after a poor performance in the opening 45 minutes @entity0 claimed it may take record signing @entity19 a full year to adapt to @entity30 football when it comes to putting his medals on the table @entity3 has the silverware to silence the critics			1
he also has the references to convince @entity5 supporters that his current dip in form will soon pass			2
@entity39 signed him ; @entity40 stuck by him ; sir @entity41 handed him his man of the match award after the 2014 @entity44 final ; and @entity7 team - mates all knew he would be missed when he left the club last summer			2
@entity47 tweeted when he was sold : ‘ thanks for everything			0
i wish you all the best , even if you are going to @entity5			2
we will never forget the zig - zag in extra-time in @entity54			0
’ that message refers to the run and shot that led to @entity58 putting @entity7 ahead against @entity59 in the @entity44 final			2
it was the perfect end to his best season at a club where he was also instrumental in winning a @entity65 under @entity66 and the league and another @entity65 under @entity39			0
@entity19 has had a difficult season after making a fast start to life at @entity11 following his move the midfielder had a particularly bad afternoon against @entity14 last week before being hooked it should be remembered that his glorious last campaign also came with a mid-season glitch			1
he famously grabbed his crotch in a disrespectful snub to @entity66 and the booing @entity79 after being substituted during a game at the start of the year			2
there was pressure on the coach to put @entity58 on the right wing ahead of the @entity86 and feeling he was being edged out of the side unfairly in spite of a good start to the season he reacted			0
@entity66 did not ostracise him as many demanded , instead he reinvented him			0
moving him from the right of @entity7 ’s front three to the left of their midfield three , there he became @entity98 ’s top assist provider			0
he played 22 passes leading to goals last season including one that helped win the @entity65 and one that helped secure the @entity44			0
@entity66 stuck with @entity19 during a slump and he eventually helped them win @entity44 @entity19 played a starring role during the @entity44 final against @entity59 last season @entity19 celebrated with the @entity44 before he moved to @entity5 last summer it is that willingness and versatility that first attracted @entity39 and he made him one of his first signings at @entity7 for £ 20m from @entity111			1
the signing was not an outright success as @entity114 continued to dominate in @entity22			0
@entity19 played in the first @entity116 v @entity117 in november 2010 and was as culpable as any of his team - mates as @entity7 went down 5 - 0 in one of the worst humiliations of the @entity123 manager 's career			1
but @entity19 never stopped going in that first season and the following march at @entity126 in the @entity65 final , also against @entity114 , it was a lung - busting run from @entity19 in minute 103 and a cross to the back post headed in by @entity130 that gave @entity39 his first trophy in @entity22			2
the following year @entity19 helped his boss win the league			2
@entity19 made an exciting start to his career at @entity11 , pictured here celebrating a goal against @entity138 the midfiedler also scored against @entity140 and all three of his league goals were scored by early october @entity39 ’s judgement is rarely off and the same can be said for @entity66 's			1
he knew not to discard @entity19 just because @entity58 had arrived , channelling his qualities for the good of the team			0
real are missing him now			0
last season @entity147 and @entity19 protected real full backs @entity149 and @entity150 leaving @entity58 and @entity130 to concentrate on the business of terrorising opposition defences			0
this year with the @entity86 sold and @entity147 injured they are , by their own standards , struggling with @entity130 and particularly @entity58 , criticised for not working back in defence			0
a first - season dip after a brilliant start is also nothing new for a player in his first season in the @entity161			1
@entity162 suffered the same at @entity163 after his high - profile move from @entity7 and @entity19 has more excuses than most to have dropped his performances levels			1
@entity19 played a key role for @entity168 as they reached the final of the @entity171 in @entity172 last summer the former @entity7 midfielder starred for @entity168 in a 4 - 2 win against @entity175 in september he played 52 of @entity7 ’s 60 games last season and then played a big part in @entity168 ’s @entity171 campaign			1
he might have foreseen a more relaxing season this time but he had to move his family to @entity182 from @entity7 in the summer and has the added stress of a further temporary move into a hotel after the recent attempted burglary at his @entity188 home			1
that and @entity191 ’s failure to find the magic formula on the pitch and his preference for a more patient passing game has not helped the 27 - year - old ’s cause			0
his anarchic road - runner raids forward are a poor fit for the tactical straight - jacket @entity191 occasionally imposes on his players			0
being hooked at half - time against @entity14 does not look good on @entity19 ’s resume but alongside his @entity204 ( scoring the winner in the final ) his @entity44 medal and the glowing references from @entity39 and @entity66 , there is more than enough to remind everyone that while his current form is off , his class will eventually shine through .			1
