by @entity0 published : 14:36 est , 1 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:26 est , 1 december 2013 @entity5 mobsters ' links with big business are currently under scrutiny after it emerged that some banks were lending money to gangsters , or ' yakuza '			1
file picture the seedy links between @entity5 mobsters - the dreaded yakuza - and the bankers who loan them millions have been laid bare as the nation 's government cracks down on organised crime			1
@entity5 is engulfed in its worst mob scandal in years and it 's shining a rare light on the links between big business and shadowy organised crime groups usually known for street - level ventures like extortion and loan sharking			1
but with membership falling as police crack down ever harder , experts say the yakuza are branching far outside their traditional areas into everything from insider trading to funding business startups			1
the crackdown at home has intensified after @entity38 said in september that it had loaned money to organised crime members , an admission subsequently repeated by at least four other major lenders including @entity5 's biggest bank , @entity43			1
' insider trading has become huge - you can make much more money manipulating stocks than extorting businesses ' , says @entity49 , a crime writer whose bestselling memoir ' @entity50 ' is set to become a @entity52 movie			2
@entity49 , a former reporter at @entity5 's top - selling @entity53 daily , likens the @entity54 , @entity5 's biggest organised crime group , to ' @entity56 with guns '			1
many mobsters - famous for their elaborate full - body tattoos and lopped - off little fingers - have now ditched their street tough personas in favour of tailored suits and a clean - cut look that would not look out of place in any boardroom , @entity49 said			2
' they 're savvy investors , ' he said added			0
' they like to gamble			0
' the yakuza occupy a grey area in @entity5 's usually law - abiding society			1
much like the @entity73 , they are both feared and loathed as social outcasts , while also being revered in equal measure through film , fanzines and manga cartoons			2
they engage in activities ranging from gambling , drugs , and prostitution to loan sharking , protection rackets and other illegal ventures , often run through front companies			0
but unlike their foreign counterparts , yakuza are legal groups with offices in major @entity5 cities , and they have historically been tolerated by authorities , although there are periodic clampdowns			1
in fact , the @entity54 helped dole out food after a major quake in the western city of @entity100 in 1995			0
@entity49 , a former @entity53 daily crime reporter and an expert on the yakuza , says the mobsters are heavily involved in the business world but @entity105 is now under intense pressure from abroad to clamp down on yakuza and their money laundering , as the @entity110 works to freeze the overseas assets of top @entity5 crime groups which it says make ' billions of dollars annually in illicit proceeds '			1
sometimes loans were legitimately used by gangsters to buy foreign sports cars or other expensive items , while in other cases the vehicle was quickly sold on the black market with the loan never paid back			0
the scandal at @entity38 worsened after it initially said top executives knew nothing about the loans , only to backtrack on that claim as a company - commissioned report emerged that blasted its laissez - faire compliance			0
@entity38 later said more than 50 executives would be punished , with its chief executive forfeiting six months pay			0
but the latest admissions are not a first for the country 's banks , a big source of concern among police wary of sharing details of investigations with mob - linked firms , experts say			2
@entity143 in @entity105 , a major business and entertainment district			0
@entity146 are moving into investment and legitimate businesses as a response to a police crackdown on organised crime ' it is baffling that @entity38 board members failed to act , ' said @entity154 , professor of financial law at @entity156			1
' once they learned that loan recipients were related to the mob , they should have taken immediate action			0
' major lenders are routinely approached by those with links to organised crime looking to raise money , said an anti-yakuza campaigner in @entity105 , echoing calls from finance minister @entity168 , among others , to tighten banking rules			0
' crime syndicates ... are out to make money , and they 'll use whatever means available , ' said the campaigner , who asked not to be identified			0
' many companies are trying not to deal with organised crime ... but it 's difficult to filter everything because their methods are also becoming sophisticated			0
' earlier this year , the @entity178 launched a database to help keep those with mob links out of the country 's stock market			0
ink : @entity146 are known for their elaborate body art. @entity185 the pressure on @entity105 to clean up the problem is set to intensify as @entity5 looks to host the @entity190			1
on paper , the crackdown appears headed in the right direction with yakuza membership down by about 28 per cent to 63,000 in 2012 from a decade ago , according to police data			2
still , yakuza links run deep in @entity5 and some observers say their tough enforcement keeps street crime low			1
their place is so deeply rooted that senior politicians are sometimes found to have mob ties , including ex-justice minister @entity203 who resigned last year following reports of his association with mobsters			2
' there are lots of politicians that , in some sense , owe their positions to yakuza support back in old days , so clearly their influence is not non-existent , ' @entity49 says			2
' it 's still a bizarre system because @entity5 's organised crime groups are legal entities			1
they are regulated but not banned			0

the feared yakuza are moving into more legitimate *enterprises*
some @entity5 banks have admitted to loaning cash to mobsters
@entity146 operate in a shadowy , *semi-legitimate* world that *fascinates* public
