the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , was originally put on the market for £ 900,000 when it went on the market in 2011			1
but after being reduced to £ 490,000 by @entity13 last may , its guide price has been slashed once again to attract a buyer as it goes up for auction in @entity16 next week			1
unattractive offer : the @entity6 has stood empty for the past three years prominent position : the 23 - bedroom hotel attracted thousands of guests in its heyday during its heyday the hotel attracted thousands of visitors to the @entity8 coast but after shutting up shop in 2011 it has failed to attract a buyer			1

for sale : the venue is being auction for £ 250k - three years after it was valued at £ 1m ' eyesore ' : the hotel is going under the hammer to attract a buyer after standing empty for three years but after its closure local residents branded it an eyesore			1
@entity50 from @entity51 said : ‘ the @entity6 was a really nice and classy place , so i 'm hoping that it remains a hotel			2
‘ but the main thing is that something is done with it - even if it 's turned into flats			2
‘ at the moment it looks awful			0
it 's in a really prominent position in the town and it 's terrible to see it all boarded up			0
surely at £ 250,000 it must finally sell			0
