in fact , @entity0 ( right ) says @entity35 manager @entity1 is the only national team boss who has been on the phone to him this season			1
‘ in this moment , since the beginning of the season , i think from all national teams , i ’ve had one phone call — from @entity1			1
that ’s the only one , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ there are no rules , no laws to protect us — just the mentality of the national coaches and teams			2
it ’s up to them to take good care of the players or to think in a selfish way			2
it ’s up to them , not to us			2
‘ i ’m not the kind of guy to tell players not to go on international duty or to pretend they have problems			1
i stimulate them to go and like them to go			2
@entity61 ( third from right ) keeps the ball up as @entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 look on @entity0 watches @entity66 ( back , right ) and @entity67 stretch their legs alongside each other @entity65 shows off his skills as @entity18 prepare to host @entity11 on tuesday evening at @entity72 ‘ sometimes national coaches and medical departments in federations want to establish relations and are interested in players			1

but we ca n’t resolve that			0

‘ at @entity97 ( @entity96 manager @entity95 used to call me three times a week about @entity99			1
‘ if one day i become national coach i will do it my way			0
with so many years on this side of the situation as a club manager , i hope i will be good for the clubs and take care of them and the players			1
‘ at this moment , i ’m on this side of it and have to accept the way it is			0
i ’m not happy when we give a player in good condition and they come back in bad condition			0
’ @entity0 said yesterday he has ‘ no idea ’ when @entity6 will be fit enough to return to the first - team fold			1
it is thought he has a slim chance to be fit for the crunch visit to @entity125 on sunday — but his absence tonight means either @entity127 or @entity128 will lead the line			0
@entity18 are also without @entity130 ( foot ) , @entity132 ( groin ) and @entity29 ( illness ) , though the latter two did train yesterday			2
