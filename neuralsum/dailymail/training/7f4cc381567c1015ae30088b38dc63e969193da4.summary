a teenager who killed herself the day after a social worker assessed her as not posing a high risk to herself was ' failed by professionals from all agencies ' , a damning report says			1
@entity6 , 15 , hanged herself at a beauty spot near her home in @entity9 , @entity10 on january 4 , 2013 , the day after she was seen by a social worker at @entity10 's @entity12 ( @entity12 )			1
the teenager , a pupil at @entity14 , in @entity9 , was academically very able and gifted in sports and music , playing hockey and also attending the @entity18 in @entity19			2
@entity6 was ' failed by professionals from all agencies ' , according to a new report into her death @entity24 's father , @entity25 , and his wife , @entity26 , feel their daughter was let down by by the system an inquest into her death heard last week that @entity24 , who had suffered from bulimia after and alleged sex attack on a school trip and who was upset over a failed relationship , had taken an overdose , self - harmed , and written letters of farewell to friends of relatives but @entity24 , whose mother , @entity26 , is a gp , had not been deemed to be a risk to herself , and a referral to a mental health service near her home led to no action being taken for a month			1
when she did see a @entity12 social worker , she was judged to be posing no imminent risk to herself			2
a new report of a review into @entity24 's death and the events leading up to it was published today by @entity57			1
the report , in which @entity24 is referred to as ' @entity59 ' , slams the social workers who dealt with her for blaming her behaviour on ' a normal histrionic adolescent response ' to her failed relationship			1
it says : ' the failure of professionals from all agencies to recognise the full extent of @entity59 's difficulties and take protective action is at first baffling in the face of mounting evidence that she was at high risk of suicide			2
' the 42 - page review identified a ' lack of knowledge among a range of professionals ' about the evidence for high - risk indicators for teenage suicide leaving them ' ill - equipped ' to recognise the signs and respond accordingly			1
let down : @entity24 displayed ' mounting evidence that she was at high risk of suicide ' , the review report said and it said there was a ' lack of appreciation of the " inner world of teenagers " ' and ' false reassurance ' that children would receive the help they needed			1
the report also questioned whether health professionals relied on the ability of @entity24 's parents , ' apparently engaged , professional parents ' , to protect her , and whether this affected their judgement in deciding on the need for intervention in @entity24 's case			2
@entity24 's parents , @entity109 and @entity110 , who are originally from @entity111 , @entity112 , have said they felt their daughter was let down by the system supposed to help children and young people suffering mental anguish			0
and during the inquest last week , coroner for south and east @entity10 , @entity118 , heard that the @entity12 was in disarray			0
@entity122 , assistant director ( children 's services ) for @entity126 's @entity10 and chairman of @entity57 at the time of the report 's writing , said : ' the review report asks some serious and difficult questions for which there are few simple or straightforward answers			1
the teenager 's problems had been written off as ' normal , histrionic adolescent response ' by professionals ' it is impossible to guarantee that a situation like this will not happen again , but the action plan that has been developed is our considered response to the findings and outlines the steps that will be taken to minimise that risk as far as possible			0
' when any child dies it is a tragedy , but especially so in these circumstances			0
if there are families or young people out there struggling with similar issues , i strongly encourage them seek out help			0
' @entity159 @entity158 ( @entity160 ) clinical gp lead , children and safeguarding , dr @entity163 , said : ' @entity24 was a beautiful and talented young lady and will be deeply missed by all that knew her			0
' working with our partners , we are responding to the changing needs of children and teenagers in a world unrecognisable 20 years ago			0
' the explosion of social media and pressures felt by young people has never been greater , and we are adapting and changing the services designed to protect children and young people to meet their needs			0
