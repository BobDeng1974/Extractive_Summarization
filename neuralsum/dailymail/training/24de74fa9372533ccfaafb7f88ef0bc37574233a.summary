fears of another @entity1 were triggered yesterday when the @entity3 government announced plans for a new centre for migrants in @entity7			1
intended as a ‘ humanitarian response ’ to the growing number of people living rough in the area , the centre will offer mainly medical facilities			2
but residents warned that migrants would flock to the proposed facility			2
@entity1 was a controversial @entity36 centre located just outside the port that acted as a magnet for thousands of migrants before it was closed following riots in 2002			1
official figures now put the number of migrants in @entity7 at 2,300 – up from 1,500 in august			2
violent clashes between rival migrant gangs competing for the best locations to board lorries are an almost daily occurrence			0
announcing the new centre yesterday , @entity3 ’s interior minister said he wanted to stop illegal camping in @entity7 and house asylum seekers throughout the country			1
@entity54 also said migrants wanting to apply for asylum in @entity26 would be offered legal advice to help them with their applications			1
but he insisted these measures would not encourage more migrants to arrive in @entity7 , as happened with @entity1			1
the facility will be housed in a leisure centre – a summer school for children – with kitchens capable of catering for up to 500 people			2
there is also heating , toilets and showers			0
@entity3 police used tear gas on crowds of migrants this week in @entity7 when around 300 attempted to storm lorries heading for the channel the mayor of @entity7 said last week she could close the port if the situation was not improved soon thousands of migrants have set up camp in the port town in recent months in the hope of gaining access to the @entity26 there are beds at the centre , but mr @entity54 said only the most vulnerable , including mothers with children , would be allowed to use them			1
mr @entity54 backed the centre ‘ with one condition – that the operating rules are clear and everyone demonstrates responsibility for the security of the site , and that it is protected from savage behaviour			2
‘ we will make sure that the building of illegal camps is stopped ’			0
@entity102 , the deputy mayor of @entity7 , said the centre could be a new @entity1			1
‘ some are saying that it will and we ca n’t do anything because @entity107 is already a magnet , ’ he said			0
‘ well , @entity107 is not			0
‘ it was the same problem with @entity1 at the beginning			1
it was working well but it ’s the number of migrants which causes problems , not the migrants themselves			0
‘ it could become a problem again at the new centre : i am not saying it will , but it could			0
’ he said that housing migrants in centres around @entity3 would not work as they would go straight back to the @entity7 camp			1
‘ when a camp is dismantled and migrants are sent to different parts of the country and told that they can claim asylum in @entity3 , they are back in @entity7 within a week , ’ he added			1
critics fear the centre could have a similar effect to one opened in 2002 which attracted hordes of @entity134 and @entity135 migrants who had to be controlled by police after breaking out into riots ( pictured ) the creation of @entity1 in 2002 brought on a period of sustained violence in the port town with			1
@entity135 migrants break down the fence at one refugee camp ( pictured ) mr @entity54 also announced that more police would be drafted in , saying that security was his number one priority			0
‘ people from @entity7 have the right to peace , ’ he said			0
‘ my first task is to assure their safety			0
so from today there will be a total of 450 police and gendarmes mobilised in @entity7 , which is exceptional for a district of 75,000 inhabitants , but totally justified given the situation			0
’ @entity26 has given £ 12million to the @entity3 to enhance security measures as clashes between migrants have grown more violent and their attempts to reach @entity26 more desperate			1
@entity165 , prefect of the @entity7 region , said there had been a marked rise in crime linked to the migrants			0
he did not give a date for the opening of the centre .			2

a centre will be opened to deal with swelling numbers of migrants at port
@entity3 authorities to give legal advice to those seeking asylum in @entity26
thousands stormed the @entity36 centre , @entity1 , which opened in 2002
fears the *announcement* will attract even more to the crossing are rife
