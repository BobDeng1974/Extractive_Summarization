by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:59 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 03:36 est , 30 august 2013 @entity3 and @entity4 customers are now able to access high - speed 4g internet on their mobiles – but only if they own one of a handful of brand - new smartphones			1
the networks launched the service yesterday in a bid to rival @entity13 , which introduced its @entity15 package last october			1
@entity4 has now switched on @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
however @entity3 has so far only launched it in some parts of @entity16 ahead of its @entity22 - wide roll - out			1
@entity3 will offer @entity26 football and music downloads as part of its 4g packages			2
customers will be able to choose from unlimited music downloads from @entity31 or free @entity32 , as part of the bundle			0
the firm launched its 4g service with a football match in @entity38 ( pictured ) consumers are still confused about the merits of 4g technology , a report suggests			2
one in five people think the high - speed broadband wo n't improve their current service and one in three say they do not need @entity15 , it found			2
a third of consumers also said they believe it would be too expensive to switch to the speedier services			0
@entity51 , a telecoms expert at comparison site broadbandchoices.co.uk , said ; ' more people are aware of @entity15 now compared to when it first launched last year , but most still do not understand the difference it will make to their experience as a mobile user			2
' ' just like the black and white televisions of yesteryear , @entity59 is doing a perfectly good job for millions of customers - but @entity15 is the technicolour revolution			0
' the service lets users surf the web at speeds that are between five and seven times faster than @entity59			1
but experts last night warned customers to ‘ think very carefully ’ about the cost of changing before making the switch			0
both @entity4 and @entity3 currently offer fewer than 15 mobiles that work with their 4g networks			1
this means that most customers – including those who own the @entity79 – will have to purchase a new phone before they can upgrade			0
even with a compatible handset , existing customers will pay on average £ 5 a month extra for a 4g tariff			2
millions will then be unable to access the 4g service in their hometown for months or even years			2
@entity87 , a technology expert from comparison website @entity88 , said : ‘ this could prove very expensive for customers , so people need to consider the extra costs			0
‘ you need to ask if you can get @entity15 in your area and when will it arrive , as well as how much you will need to spend to upgrade your phone to one which is 4g - compatible			0
‘ a lot of people will have to pay a few hundred quid to buy a new phone and break their contract , even those with relatively new smartphones			0
‘ lastly , you need to ask yourself if the more expensive tariff will be worth it			0
not everyone will need faster internet			0
’ he added : ‘ naturally over time people will change to 4g but there is a lot to think about at the moment			0
’ the @entity15 system allows smartphones , tablets and laptops to surf the web around five times faster than over @entity59 , although @entity3 claims its network is , on average , six times faster			1
it launched the service with the help of ex @entity126 legends @entity128 and @entity129 as well as ex @entity132 heroes @entity130 and @entity134 @entity3 spent £ 802 million when it bid for part of the mobile phone spectrum to provide @entity15 , while @entity4 spent £ 550m to buy a proportion of the lowest frequency spectrum			1
@entity134 and @entity128 are pictured launching @entity3 's 4g service subscribers to @entity15 can download a song in four seconds or post a photograph to a social networking site in six seconds			1
they will also be able to watch films , videos and television straight from the internet as easily and quickly as from a home computer			0
@entity4 and @entity3 have pledged to have @entity15 network coverage in more cities by the end of the year – including @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
but they will still lag some way behind @entity13 , which already offers their 4g service in 105 @entity22 towns and cities			1
telecoms expert @entity51 said now might not be the right time to switch , but insisted @entity15 internet will soon start to grow in popularity			0
he said : ‘ just like the black - and - white televisions of yesteryear , @entity59 is doing a perfectly good job for millions of customers – but @entity15 is the @entity177 revolution			0
’ @entity4 is launching in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 with a further 10 cities including @entity157 and @entity159 expected to be connected by the end of the year			1
@entity4 's tariffs start at £ 26 a month and come with 12 months free music when bought direct from @entity4 @entity13 , which was formed from the merger of @entity13 and @entity13 , was the first company to offer a 4g network in the @entity22			1
@entity13 held the monopoly on the network because regulator @entity186 gave it permission to use existing spectrum ( @entity189 ) that it already owned			0
@entity186 then held an auction for companies to bid to use other parts of the spectrum from @entity193 to @entity194			0
@entity4 purchased @entity196 lots and @entity3 won both @entity196 and @entity194 lots			1
for the typical user , download speeds of initial 4g networks should be at least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3g networks			1
in july , @entity13 announced it was doubling its 4g speeds for people in @entity152 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity17 , @entity157 , @entity16 , @entity158 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
the speed boost makes the network twice as fast as current average 4g speeds and 10 times as fast as @entity59			2
@entity213 has kicked off a price war earlier this week over the new 4g service by announcing it will offer the super high - speed internet at no extra cost			2
the firm ’s 1.5million customers will get @entity15 at the same price they pay for the current @entity59 , with packages of calls , texts and unlimited internet from £ 15 a month			2

@entity3 's 4g tariffs start at £ 26 per month			1
@entity3 will offer @entity26 football and music downloads as part of its superfast packages and anyone signing up will be able to choose from unlimited music downloads from @entity31 , or free @entity32 , as part of the bundle			0
