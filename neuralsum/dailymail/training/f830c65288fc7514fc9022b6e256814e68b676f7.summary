by @entity0 published : 19:10 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 19:11 est , 12 december 2012 luxury : @entity2 , pictured , @entity3 , has spent £ 23,000 on luxurious hotels in his first ten months in the job			1
@entity7 defence minister @entity6 said mr @entity2 needed to ' justify such extravagance ' in the face of department cuts the highest paid civil servant in the @entity12 charged the taxpayer £ 23,000 for luxury hotel stays in his first ten months in the job			1
@entity2 , the man in charge of the department ’s equipment programme , is paid £ 220,000 a year – far in excess of the £ 142,500 earned by the prime minister			1
yet he racked up an astonishing £ 23,000 expenses bill for 106 overnight stays in @entity23 and @entity24 - at a time when his department is facing huge budget cuts			1
the spending on hotels is even more remarkable because mr @entity2 ’s home is just a 60 - mile drive from his offices in @entity34 and the @entity36 organisation at @entity37 in @entity24			1
he also has access to a taxpayer - funded official car and driver worth £ 49,000			2
had he decided to get a train home from @entity43 to @entity44 , @entity45 , it would have cost just £ 21 for a single fare			0
the revelations over the @entity3 ’s five - star lifestyle caused outrage as ministers press ahead with controversial cuts that have seen 22,000 troops , warships , fighter jets and tanks axed to save money			1
@entity57 defence spokesman @entity6 said : ‘ people will be as shocked as they are furious to hear @entity2 has been living such a luxurious lifestyle funded by hard pressed taxpayers			1
‘ at a time when our soldiers in @entity65 are having their pensions and front line allowances cut , ministers at the @entity12 and mr @entity2 will have to justify such extravagance			2
‘ mr @entity2 clearly does not live by the government ’s old mantra that “ we are all in this together ”			2
his local mp does not claim a second home allowance , so why has he run up such a high hotel bill ? ’ @entity75 , of the @entity76 ’ @entity78 pressure group , said : ‘ taxpayers and troops alike will take a dim view of a top @entity12 official racking up such expensive hotel bills so often			0
‘ the @entity12 has handled @entity2 ’s appointment and contract appallingly badly			2
the man charged with getting a grip of the procurement budget needs to get a grip of his own expenses			0
’ mr @entity2 , a former businessman and @entity57 adviser , was appointed in december 2010 to bring the @entity12 ’s chaotic multi-billion - pound equipment budget under control			1
but between january and october 2011 he spent a third of nights in hotels rather than travelling home			0
fury : mr @entity2 's expenses are controversial given @entity12 cutbacks			2
he earns £ 220,000 a year			1
the @entity12 said mr @entity2 had ' an awful lot of meetings ' he stayed 88 times in the capital , enjoying the ‘ stunning ’ hospitality at the £ 360 - a - night five - star @entity107 hotel in @entity109 , a @entity111 - listed former bank a stone ’s throw from @entity114			1
on other occasions he overnighted in the @entity116 , which is described as ‘ elegantly composed ’			0
he stayed over on some nights after being wined and dined by blue - chip defence companies including @entity119 and @entity120 or consultants such as @entity122			0
mr @entity2 stayed in @entity24 18 times at either the @entity124 , @entity125 or the @entity126			2
the limit for civil servants to claim for staying in @entity23 is officially £ 135 a night , according to the @entity12 the row comes just days after it emerged that the @entity12 had broken @entity34 rules by failing to get mr @entity2 ’s pay package signed off by the @entity132			1
the @entity12 justified his stays on the grounds that he had a shoulder injury and the journey between home and work would cause ‘ significant discomfort ’ and ‘ impede recovery ’			0
however , he was fit enough to travel to @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and the @entity144 for business meetings			0
the @entity12 also said that it would be impractical for mr @entity2 to spend nights at home in @entity44 if he was extremely busy			2
‘ he had an awful lot of meetings with people in industry , ’ said an insider			0
‘ if he was getting home at 1am and then getting up at 5am for a breakfast meeting he could not do the job he needed to			0
’ since november 2011 , mr @entity2 has received a £ 2,000 - a - month taxpayer - funded allowance to help him rent a @entity23 apartment			1
the @entity12 is in discussions with @entity160 about whether this is a taxable benefit			0
an @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ employees may be reimbursed the cost of temporary overnight accommodation and breakfast when they are absent from their normal place of work on official business and where an overnight stay in a hotel is necessary			0
‘ thus it will primarily be when they are away on business but it may also be granted when an employee has to work late , and it is too late to return home			0
