by @entity0 published : 07:23 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 07:23 est , 4 april 2013 reality star @entity1 loves to cause a stir			1
her recent on - screen antics have had @entity5 fans glued to their screens as she put the men of @entity8 firmly in their place and although the series ends this week the bubbly blonde has no intention of taking things easy as she unveils her third fashion collection for plus size women			1
the fashion line , which is available in sizes 14 - 22 and was launched last year , has proved to be a brilliant success for the @entity20 business woman			1
as a woman who embraces her curves , the 32 - year - old is well placed to design fashion that flatters and her frank style advice has secured her an army of fans as well as a regular presenting slot on @entity29 's @entity28			1
the @entity30 ( also available in black and mocha ) £ 65 the @entity32 ( also available in black ) £ 60 her latest collection is designed with the summer season in mind , with bright colours and glamorous details giving the dresses a more grown - up feel			1
the former car sales assistant has reworked the most popular styles from her previous two collections in new colour ways ( the @entity46 maxi dress now comes in block - colour and the lace ' @entity50 ' dress has been made in a sophisticated navy )			1
@entity1 said : ' i am so excited that my new spring summer range of the @entity54 is finally here			0
' this new range is fresh , vibrant and i have designed it using gorgeous fabrics that make the bigger girl feel a million dollars			1
the @entity59 £ 60 the @entity60 ( also available in black / peach ) £ 70 the @entity62 ( also available in cream ) £ 65 the @entity64 £ 70 ' i have added colour for the new season as i want every girl to feel as glamorous as me in my dresses			1
' i have also included a few classics with flattering shapes but still in the signature @entity1 style			0
' it sounds silly but i have no favourites in the range really as i love them all the same			0
i would never design something that i did n’t feel passionate about it and these are all beauties			0
' i like to use colour as i want to celebrate curves			0
the plus size market to date is dull and depressing , i want big girls to feel accepted in society and be joyous and bright when they put clothes on			2
' i choose the prints and colours from the feeling i get from them			0
if a fabric makes me smile or makes me get excited then i know it 's the right choice			0
' being a bigger girl i feel the limited plus size high street shops offer all the wrong fabrics so i spent 6 months learning about fabrics feeling them researching them and realised the slinky fabrics that skim the curves are most flattering			2
the @entity98 £ 40 the @entity59 £ 60 ' i love all the old film stars really @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
these women took glamour to the max. i like the @entity108 sisters ' style as they rock their curves			0
i wake up at 4am some mornings thinking about designs			2
' my main passion for designing is taking in trends and thinking how can i make this flattering and fun for the fuller figure ? ' @entity1 's debut 50 - piece collection , launched in 2012 , was estimated to have turned over £ 1m			1
the star said at the time her success would be all the sweeter because it would be one in the eye for the bullies and internet trolls that make fun of her for being fat			2
she says : ' it makes me laugh to think people take the mick out of my size , but i ’ve made being larger actually very profitable			2
on top of that i ’ve met the man of my dreams [ show co-star @entity135 ]			0
as far as i ’m concerned that ’s enough to answer any critics ... frankly , they can kiss my a * * * ! ' @entity1 ’ collection is available now from @entity141			0

the new styles , available in sizes 14 - 22 , are designed for a *day* at the races
they are *inspired* by old *school* movie stars @entity100 and @entity101
