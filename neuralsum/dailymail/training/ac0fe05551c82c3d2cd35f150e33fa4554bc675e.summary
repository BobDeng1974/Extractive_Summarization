after a mentally ill @entity1 made a lewd gesture to a female guard at the @entity5 jail , he was locked in his cell alone for seven increasingly agitated days in which he was denied some of his medication , clogged his toilet so that it overflowed , stripped off his clothes and tied a rubber band tightly around his genitals			1
during that period , guards passed @entity1 's cell in the mental observation unit dozens of times , peering through the window in the steel door but never venturing inside â€” until it was too late			1
the 39 - year - old @entity1 was eventually found naked and unresponsive on the floor , covered in feces , his genitals swollen and badly infected			1
he was rushed to a hospital but died hours later			1
died alone : in september of 2013 , @entity1 , 39 , who was mentally ill and an inmate at the @entity5 jail in @entity26 , died a gruesome death there after being locked alone in his cell for seven days ' he did n't have to leave this world like that			1
they could have put him in a mental hospital , got him some treatment , ' @entity1 's mother , @entity31 , said from her @entity38 , @entity37 , home			1
' he was a caring young man			0
' @entity1 's death last september , detailed in documents obtained by @entity41 and in interviews with two city officials on condition of anonymity , came five months before another @entity5 inmate in a similar mental health unit died in a cell that climbed to a suffocating 101 degrees because of malfunctioning heating equipment			1
experts say @entity1 's death is only the latest example of how poorly equipped the city 's jail system is to handle the mentally ill , who make up about 40 per cent of the 12,000 inmates in the nation 's most populous city			2
a third of those inmates suffer from serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder			0
in @entity1 's case , his family said he had been diagnosed as schizophrenic more than a decade ago , and he also had diabetes			2
faced with rising criticism over conditions at @entity5 , mayor @entity67 has vowed reforms			2
@entity72 spokesman @entity71 said in a statement wednesday that @entity1 's case is under investigation			0
he said mental health and jail officials have started shift - by - shift briefings on inmates like @entity1 and are working on other measures ' so that a similar tragedy will not happen again			1
' more tests are needed to determine exactly how @entity1 died , the medical examiner 's office says			2
but preliminary findings show that he probably succumbed to sepsis , an infection that has spread through the body , according to the two officials			0
@entity1 grew up in @entity38 and moved to @entity26 to pursue a better life after working as a cook in a fried chicken restaurant , his family said			0
he spent six years behind bars after being arrested in 2004 for assaulting a receptionist and another employee of a @entity26 law firm			0
last june , he was arrested in @entity38 on public lewdness and assault charges for punching and exposing himself to a bus driver			0
he was sent back to jail in @entity26 for not telling his parole officer that he had left the city			0
he was first placed in a @entity5 facility for 17 days , then a @entity72 psychiatric hospital for 38 days			2
then he was sent to a roughly 30 - bed mental observation unit at @entity5			2
in documents obtained by the @entity41 via a public records request , @entity105 , executive director of the city @entity106 , gave her account of @entity1 's case , based on a review of records , security footage and interviews with inmates			0
grisly death : this 1990 photo provided by @entity119 of his step - son @entity1 shows @entity1 in @entity38 when he was 16			0
@entity1 was found naked , covered in feces with a rubber band tied around his badly infected genitals at @entity5 she noted that even though @entity1 was in a unit where inmates are ordinarily allowed in and out of their cells to mingle with others for 14 hours a day , he was locked up continuously for seven days and for most of that time was n't given his medication			1
the type of medication was not disclosed			0
guards confined @entity1 to his cell on september 4 after he stared for hours at a female officer , rolled up his shirt to look like a penis and thrust it toward her , @entity105 said			1
the next day , @entity105 wrote , @entity1 intentionally flooded his combination sink - toilet , after which a mental health provider spoke with him for 15 seconds through the cell door			1
the next day , a plumber turned off the water to his cell			0
over the next few days , guards and deputy wardens looked in his cell dozens of times throughout the day , @entity105 wrote , and the inmate was at times seen at the @entity151 september 10 , video of an inmate delivering a tray of food to @entity1 's cell showed the inmate covering his nose with his shirt and three officers backing away , ' presumably because of the foul odor coming from the cell , ' @entity105 wrote			1
@entity1 was checked on at least two dozen times that day and night , with an officer at one point seen kicking his cell door several times , according to @entity105 's account			2
by the time medical staffers were called in and his cell was opened , @entity1 was so weak he could n't move			1
he was pronounced dead early on the morning of september 11			0
under city rules , mental health staffers are required to make twice - daily rounds in the unit where @entity1 was jailed , and the guards on duty are supposed to be steadily assigned there and receive annual mental health training			1
but mental health staffers visited @entity1 's cell only once before he was discovered to be in distress , according to @entity105			1
and of the 53 officers who worked in the unit in the days leading up to @entity1 's death , only one was steady , and none had received the required annual refresher course on mental health , @entity105 wrote			1
terrible conditions : @entity1 died last year at @entity189 after another @entity5 inmate in a similar mental health unit died in a cell that climbed to a suffocating 101 degrees because of malfunctioning heating equipment following @entity1 's death , @entity195 officials said a state investigation found workers missed multiple opportunities to treat him , transferred the unit chief to another facility and retrained staffers on how to do rounds and other procedures			1
jail officers have long complained that they are n't sufficiently trained to handle severely mentally ill inmates			0
at a recent public meeting , a union official said trainees get 21.5 hours of mental health training during their 16 weeks of academy instruction , plus the three - hour annual refresher			1
in a statement , @entity212 , president of the @entity213 , said @entity1 's death was an example of ' non-communication between medical staff and uniform staff			2
' he said officers can notify members of the medical staff , ' but it 's clearly up to them and solely them to determine treatment			0
' @entity1 's death , though tragic , was unsurprising to those familiar with how the mentally ill fare in jails , said dr. @entity226 , a @entity227 psychiatrist who was a co-author of a report critical of jail officials ' use of solitary confinement			0
' correctional institutions are such a poor substitute for mental hospitals , which is what they 're basically functioning as in our society , ' she said			0
' the problem is the correction setting is not fit to deliver the proper care , and in fact many of the settings exacerbate their symptoms			0
' @entity119 , @entity1 's stepfather , said a jail chaplain informed the family months ago of his son 's death , but he was n't told the specifics			2
' they know , ' @entity119 said , ' that they were wrong in the way they handled the situation			0
