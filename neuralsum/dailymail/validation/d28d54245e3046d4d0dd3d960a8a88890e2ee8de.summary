@entity1 's @entity0 faces an investigation over a @entity4 feature named ' bondage for @entity6 ' where they discussed and tested sex toys at 11am			1
@entity8 said today it had received 120 complaints about the february 3 show where a scantily - clad couple were seen on a bed playing kinky games on live television			1
presenter @entity15 had said before the segment it would be in ' good taste ' , but viewers disagreed , calling it ' pornographic ' and ' highly inappropriate ' for morning television			1
several complained that they were forced to answer questions about bondage from their children , who had been watching it with them			1
investigation : @entity1 's @entity0 segment called bondage for beginners , which featured a live demonstration of @entity4 inspired sex toys , now faces an @entity8 investigation presenters @entity37 and @entity15 giggled their way through the segment , but maintained it was in ' good taste ' an @entity8 spokesman said today : ' @entity8 has opened an investigation into whether an item about ' bondage for beginners ' was suitable for broadcast before the watershed			1
' the ' bondage for @entity6 ' session was inspired by the new film of the controversial erotic novel @entity4 , which opened in cinemas in mid-february			1
presenters @entity37 and @entity15 giggled their way through the show , which also featured a discussion about sex toys			1
two models in their underwear were shown in bed using a ' feather tickler ' and discussion moved on to other sex toys like nipple - clamps			1
mr @entity15 , 52 , had warned viewers shortly after 10.30am that they would be discussing bondage equipment in three stages – beginners , intermediate and advanced – throughout the show with ' sexpert ' @entity70			2
however he assured them it would ' be done in good taste '			1
yet at one point he was so distracted by the romping models that he missed his cue to introduce the next section , while @entity77 , 36 , who is engaged to footballer @entity78 , found herself laughing uncontrollably			2
campaigners said it was an error of judgment to air the discussion at that time of day			0
@entity83 , director of @entity84 , said the show had set a dangerous example : ' it 's not enough to say most children will be at school [ at that time ] because that 's just not good enough			2
' quite apart from issues of taste and the fact that people might not want to speak to their children about this , i think it is dangerous to normalise this kind of behaviour			2
[ @entity4 ] is putting across ideas that humiliation is pleasurable and torture is gratifying and i do n't think those are healthy for anybody at all			2
' but if it is dangerous for adults then it is doubly dangerous for children watching this '			0
pre-watershed : at 11am on @entity112 two models in their underwear were shown in bed using a ' feather tickler ' and discussion moved on to other sex toys like nipple - clamps			1
viewers were not impressed either and expressed their anger online			2
@entity120 tweeted : ' used to love this morning but today was final straw , sitting with my mum , on comes the bondage # nothanks			0
' mother @entity125 wrote : ' ok bondage for beginners had to be turned over , ca n't cope with questions from the nine - year - old			0
' another said on @entity131 : ' # @entity132 is ridiculously inappropriate			0
this programme is on at my health club where there are children			0
' a friend added : ' too early for this talk # @entity132			0
this is porn now @ itvthismorning # @entity141 # inappropriate			0
' @entity1 defended itself at the time and said it had warned viewers			0
a spokesman said : ' this morning is a lifestyle programme that cover a diverse range of human interest topics			0
' the programme has dealt with advice on sexual matters many times in the past , and a suitable announcement was given at the start			0
