a bruising training session involving 50 scrums is how @entity3 ’s @entity2 prepared for saturday ’s top - of - the - table meeting with @entity5			1
the @entity6 have creaked in recent weeks and @entity7 flanker @entity3 , who claims @entity8 ’ opponents have ‘ smelt blood ’ , is desperate to re-gather the momentum that was lost following the exodus of key international players during the @entity14			1
defeats by @entity16 and @entity17 have done little to restore confidence but the @entity20 side are ready to address their mini-slump and breathe life back into the title push			1
@entity2 flanker @entity3 is keen for his side to regain their form following some recent poor results the @entity8 were dumped out of the @entity30 quarter - finals as @entity16 ran riot on their home turf ‘ i do n’t think anyone intentionally switches off , but the intensity of a @entity14 camp like that is very difficult to manage , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ some people think you ’re away at a five - star holiday resort but the pressure is real			2
it ’s a couple of per cent across the board			2
‘ you might win it and be partying or you might have lost and come back with a lack of confidence			1
then the guys who have stayed back in the trenches for @entity8 feel like the cavalry have arrived			1
in fact , the guys coming back are equally tired or even more so			2
it ’s a combination of things and it ’s difficult to manage			2
‘ now there ’s light at the end of the tunnel and we ’re not far off full strength			2
it ’s the home straight			2
’ saturday ’s showpiece fixture will be staged at stadiummk , rather than @entity64 , and a record attendance is expected at the home of @entity67			1
@entity2 ’s scrummaging pride was dented in the defeat by @entity17 and , according to @entity3 , the players have paid the price with gruelling fitness sessions			1
‘ we ’ve had to speak a few hard truths and take a good look at ourselves , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ teams have smelt blood a little bit			2
the last couple of teams have really got into us and pressured us at the scrum , which is something we pride ourselves on			0
‘ when you give them an in , the fear factor goes all of a sudden and the reputation can dwindle quickly			0
we ’ve got to plug that hole if we really want to be title challengers			0
you do n’t win a @entity87 without a strong scrum and set piece			0
@entity91 's side have been boosted by the return of @entity7 lock @entity93 ‘ we ’ve definitely been knocked off our rhythm but i do n’t think we ’ve played well for a long time			0
winning can paper over a lot of problems and mask a lot of issues			0
’ but @entity8 ’ season is still very much alive			1
they will almost guarantee a home play - off with victory while , in contrast , @entity106 campaign will be over if they lose to sale			0
the west @entity110 club also felt the squeeze of the @entity14 and they must win at the @entity112 to keep alive their slim hopes of @entity30 qualification			0
@entity106 full back @entity115 ( centre ) is hanging up his boots at the end of the season for winger @entity115 , who lines up against @entity123 this afternoon as both players prepare to hang up their boots , it is the last chance to leave his childhood club with @entity128 rugby			0
‘ i ’m not going to be here next season but i want to finish in the best possible way , ’ said @entity115			0
‘ it ’s hard to get your head around 14 years coming to an end , because i ’ve been here since i finished school and it ’s all i ’ve known			0
i might be locking horns with @entity123 , who ’s also retiring , this weekend and it will be just as competitive as the first time i faced him			0
’ @entity142 v @entity141 ( saturday : @entity144 , 3pm ) @entity145 and @entity146 form a new half - back pairing for the hosts , in a reshuffled side led by @entity150			1
@entity152 and @entity153 return to the @entity141 back row after injury breaks			0
@entity157 ( saturday : @entity159 , 3pm ) @entity7 lock contender @entity160 makes a first @entity162 appearance since february , alongside @entity163			1
@entity164 reclaims the @entity165 ’ no 10 shirt and @entity168 flanker @entity166 also starts			0
@entity2 @entity170 ( saturday : @entity172 , 3.15pm ) @entity93 has been passed fit to return for @entity8 , while prop @entity173 comes in to reinforce the pack			1
@entity176 lines up at hooker for @entity5 , but @entity178 and @entity179 are on the bench			1
@entity183 v harlequins ( saturday : @entity112 , 2pm ) the @entity185 have shifted @entity186 into the second row , to allow @entity188 to start at @entity189			1
quins are still without @entity7 full back @entity191 and have brought in @entity192 at outside centre			0
@entity195 v @entity17 ( sunday : @entity197 , 2pm ) @entity198 will wear no 8 for @entity199 after having a suspension overturned , while @entity201 is fit to start			1
@entity202 is out with a leg injury , so @entity204 takes over at full back for @entity17			1
prediction : home win .			0

@entity2 face @entity5 at @entity64 on saturday
the *reigning* champions have creaked in recent weeks
the @entity8 have lost *crucial* games to @entity16 and @entity17
