@entity1 's painkiller epidemic has been laid bare in its most stark terms to date as a @entity4 report reveals that @entity1 citizens abuse more pills than any other country in the world			1
the @entity4 's @entity9 2014 shows that 6.1 per cent of @entity1 adults , aged between 15 and 64 , abused prescribed pain opioids , such as codeine and oxycontin , in 2012			1
shockingly , that figure is twice as high as the world 's second - worst offender , @entity17 , where opioid addicts comprise 3.1 per cent of citizens			2
epidemic rising : the @entity4 's @entity9 2014 shows that 6.1 per cent of @entity1 adults abused prescribed pain opioids , such as codeine and morphine , in 2012 ' in the @entity1 , past - year illicit drug use by persons aged 12 years or older reached the highest level in the past 10 years , ' the report said , adding : ' the number of deaths resulting from prescriptionpainkiller overdose also continues to rise , especially among women			1
' it goes on to state that ' medical emergencies related to the non-medical use of pharmaceuticals ' skyrocketed by 132 per cent between 2004 and 2011 , while with the number of trips to the @entity38 for overdoses of ' opiates and / or opioids ' leapt 183 per cent in the same time frame			1
according to official figures , more than 250 million prescriptions for antidepressants were written for @entity1 in 2010			1
danger : the danger of opioids - such as oxycontin - lies primarily in the fact that they are so highly addictive , say experts @entity53 , the most infamous of prescription opioids and the main protagonist in the painkiller epidemic , did not come in a tamper - resistant formulation until 2010			1
by then , it had been implicated in thousands of overdose deaths since it hit the market in 1996 as its earlier formulation allowed users to crush it into a powder to snort or inject			0
the danger of opioids - which also include @entity69 with @entity70 , @entity71 with @entity70 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity75 and dilaudid - lies primarily in the fact that they are so highly addictive , say experts			1
@entity1 - 6.10 % 2			1
@entity17 - 3.40 % 3			2
@entity80 - 2.92 % 4			2
@entity81 - 2.40 % 5			2
@entity82 - 2.30 % 6			2
@entity83 - 2.29 % 7			2
@entity84 - 2.27 % 8			0
@entity85 - 1.71 % 9			0
@entity86 - 1.53 % 10			0
@entity87 - 1.50 % the @entity88 and @entity89 said last year that , by 2008 , ' the annual number of fatal drug poisonings surpassed those of motor vehicle deaths and overdose deaths attributable to prescription drugs exceeded those of cocaine and heroin combined			0
' the @entity99 - who published the report - describe the effect such prescription drugs have on the human body			0
it 's authors write : ' at the heart of opioid addiction is the powerful rewarding effect [ that triggers ] a cascade of intense pleasurable responses related to the brain dopamine release			0
' users describe an initial rush followed by feelings of warmth , pleasure and sedation			0
' once regular use is established , vulnerable individuals develop an uncontrollable compulsive behaviour that is the main characteristic of opioid dependence , seeking to obtain the substance in spite of any negative consequence			0
' it comes a month after it was revealed that most people who abuse addictive prescription painkillers get them for free from friends or relatives , while drug dealers are a relatively uncommon source for those at highest risk for deadly overdoses			1
a government study found that people who abuse most frequently , often ' doctor - shop ' ; more than 1 in 4 who used these drugs almost daily said they had been prescribed by one or more physicians			1
almost as many said they got them for free from friends or relatives ; only 15 percent of the most frequent abusers said they bought the drugs from dealers or other strangers			0
those abusers ' are probably using at much greater volumes and simply asking a friend for a pill now and then is not going to be sufficient , ' said dr. @entity154 , a researcher at the federal @entity155 .			0
