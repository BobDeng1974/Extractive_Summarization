author @entity0 was given total access to @entity2 during the 2013 - 14 season , @entity4 's first in charge of the @entity7 giants			1
in his new book @entity9 , @entity0 uses his behind - the - scenes pass to give readers a unique insight into @entity4 's debut campaign in @entity14			1
in this extract he covers @entity4 's decision to snub @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 in order to take over from @entity21 at the @entity22			1
how @entity4 's @entity2 took @entity18 apart at the @entity23 with all the style of @entity25 how @entity4 told his @entity2 players a story about water polo to inspire them to @entity30 victory against @entity17 @entity4 admits @entity31 semi-final defeat to @entity33 was the ' biggest f * * * - up ' of his life as a coach ' @entity37 , @entity38			1
i 've chosen @entity2 ! ' in @entity43 , in the north - east of @entity42 , @entity40 smiles			1
hard though it had been for his old friend to close one chapter of his life , the decision about his next step had obviously been an easy one			0
their destination would not after all be @entity52 , but @entity14			0
the exchange is taking place five months after @entity4 's departure from @entity25			1
in this time , he has been flooded with offers : @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and , of course , @entity2			1
in reality , they are not job offers , but love letters , project proposals for this most illustrious of coaches			0
during his sabbatical year the job offers poured in			0
his ex-colleague @entity65 , the director of football at @entity18 , was very insistent			1
he also met up in @entity66 with @entity67 , who was prepared to do anything to lure @entity4 to @entity17			1
the @entity93 club won 3 - 0 that day			2
in the event the @entity2 delegation did not get a chance speak to @entity4 , but they made their interest clear during a meeting with his agent			1
it was just six days since the @entity86 team had suffered a painful defeat by @entity17 in the @entity31 final , on penalties at their own stadium			1
it was another heavy blow for the @entity108 club at the end of a bitterly disappointing period			2
one week earlier , they had lost 5 - 2 to @entity112 in the @entity114 [ @entity14 cup ] final in @entity115			0
their opponents had just won their second consecutive league title after a brilliant campaign , beating @entity2 by eight points			1
in the space of a few weeks @entity2 had lost three titles : the @entity7 , the @entity114 and the @entity31			1
after enduring the agonising @entity31 defeat , @entity21 promised his wife that he would only go on for one more year			0
the directors of @entity2 felt the same way			1
a substitute had to be found			0
from the start @entity4 was well disposed to the overtures from the @entity108 club			1
a year before , in late july 2011 , not long after a resounding 3 - 1 victory in the @entity31 final against @entity132 at @entity133 , @entity25 competed in the @entity134 in @entity86			1
@entity4 liked the set - up at @entity136 , despite the fact that it was smaller than @entity25 's training ground and had fewer technical facilities			1
the @entity93 was impressed and told @entity40 privately : ' i like this place			0
i could see myself coaching here one day			0
' nationality : @entity143 : 43 clubs played for : @entity25 ( 1990 - 2001 ) , @entity145 ( 2001 - 2002 ) , @entity146 ( 2002 - 2003 ) , @entity145 ( 2003 ) , @entity147 ( 2003 - 2005 ) , @entity148 ( 2005 - 06 ) major honours : 6 @entity151 titles , 2 @entity152 , 1 @entity31 , 1 @entity153 , 2 @entity154 , 1 @entity155 teams managed : @entity157 ( 2007 - 2008 ) , @entity25 ( 2008 - 2012 ) , @entity2 ( 2013 - present ) major honours : 3 @entity151 titles , 2 @entity152 , 2 @entity159 , 3 @entity154 , 3 @entity160 , 1 @entity7 title , 1 @entity114 @entity40 was not too surprised by the comment			1
@entity4 had said something very similar a few months before , at @entity132			1
the day after beating @entity33 in the @entity31 semi-final , @entity4 and @entity40 travelled to @entity165 to watch their next opponent in action			1
it was may 4 , 2011 , and the pair sat together in the stands of @entity172 watching sir @entity174 's team beat @entity175 4 - 1			0
once again @entity4 had turned to his friend and said : ' i like this atmosphere			1
i could see myself coaching here one day			0
' @entity4 has always felt a deep admiration , almost veneration , for the legendary teams and players of @entity183			2
@entity40 knows this and was therefore not surprised by @entity4 's eagerness to meet up for a chat with @entity187 and @entity69 in june 2011			2
the four had a quick coffee together and it soon became clear that his feelings of admiration for the two @entity14 were reciprocated in equal measure			0
@entity2 had just appointed @entity21 to manage the second phase of their project , the initial stage having been overseen by @entity195			2
@entity4 , fresh from winning another @entity31 title with @entity25 , was still totally committed to the @entity93 club			1
at that moment none of them could have imagined how closely linked their destinies would become			0
@entity4 gets involved with @entity14 festivities with a trip to @entity203 beer festival in @entity86 @entity4 recalls : ' we were there for a friendly against @entity2 and we met @entity207 [ @entity69 ] and @entity187 [ @entity208 ] for a chat			1
i told them how much i admired both their current team and @entity2 as a club			1
it has always been one of the great clubs of @entity218 football			0
but i had never given a thought to coaching there			0
nor was i thinking about it then			0
i was certainly not offering them my services			0
the fact that i ended up signing for the club a few years later was just a twist of fate			0
' it is october 2012 and in @entity232 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 , @entity4 's three children , are still struggling to learn @entity233 and adjust to life at their new school			2
the @entity93 coach 's phone is ringing off the hook with job offers			0
@entity240 's @entity18 are still keen , and very insistent			2
@entity67 is deploying all his charm			2
he wants @entity88 and is prepared to mould the team to his specifications			0
the @entity14 , too , are determined , although their pitch is slightly lower key and to the point			0
it is now that , in one of their @entity250 chats , @entity4 tells his friend and colleague : ' prepare yourself @entity38			2
i 've chosen @entity2 ' the @entity256 replaced @entity21 ( top ) , who had led @entity2 to @entity31 glory in 2013 choosing @entity2 does not mean signing the contract immediately , however			1
it is just the first stage in the negotiations about financial terms and footballing philosophy			0
@entity187 promises @entity4 from the start : ' do n't worry , we 'll find the money			2
' @entity2 prefer to avoid debt and their policy is to ask their club members and sponsors to foot the bill for any new investment			1
in this case everyone is happy to invest in @entity88			0
they discuss their preferred playing styles and the kind of players the club will need			0
not a lot more needs to be said			0
@entity4 , @entity187 and @entity207 are on the same wavelength			2
the conversation goes so well it 's almost as if the three of them have a ball at their feet			0
they discuss @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 , and @entity4 insists that he wants to hold on to @entity292			2
@entity4 holds his first @entity7 trophy at the official champions party in @entity86 in may @entity295 an extraordinary coach - @entity69 by december they are ready to sign the contracts , and president @entity187 meets @entity4 at his home in @entity232			2
@entity4 then informs @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity19 that he is going elsewhere and before long @entity299 breaks the news			1
@entity2 's hand has been forced and on january 16 the club hastily issues a statement			1
unfortunately they also , rather insensitively , fail to inform @entity21 first			0
the incumbent coach feels badly let down			0
his friends @entity187 and @entity69 had told him they were looking for a replacement , but not who it was going to be			0
over in @entity25 tongues are wagging and @entity4 's critics accuse him of taking the soft option			2
little do they know that back in @entity313 ' metamorphosis from coach to living legend has just begun and that he is about to lead his team through a jaw - droppingly successful treble , setting the bar tremendously high for his successor			0

' @entity9 : the @entity322 of @entity4 's first season at @entity2 ' is out now in paperback and ebook , published by @entity327 / @entity326			1

@entity17 owner @entity67 met @entity4 in @entity66
the @entity256 was also wanted by @entity18 chief @entity65
but @entity4 opted to join @entity2 after getting a feel for the club
he has admitted that he could see himself coaching @entity132
@entity19 also wanted @entity4 to become their manager
