an @entity1 couple who shocked doctors by naturally conceiving identical triplets welcomed their three daughters into the world on thursday night			1
the event was one - in - a - million , medical professionals said , and @entity8 and @entity9 , of @entity10 , outside @entity11 , said they knew how they lucky they are			1
@entity12 and @entity13 weighed in at more than 4 pounds , while @entity14 weighs 5 pounds , according to 6 @entity15 , and were born at 36 weeks			1
' it 's just an awesome blessing for @entity18 to entrust us with three more little blessings all at once , ' @entity8 told the @entity1 network			1
while it will be easier as the girls grow up and develop their own characteristics and personalities , as babies it will be difficult			0
but mrs @entity24 thinks she has the answer - nail polish			1
she intends to keep track of the girls by painting each of their nails a different color - purple , pink or light blue			2
the couple were looking at an ultrasound when the technician told them they were expecting triplets			2
mr @entity9 asked whether the hospital worker was joking when he asked the technician to check			2
' sir , we do not joke about this , ' the technician said before telling @entity9 and mrs @entity24 about the triplets , the @entity54 reported			2
@entity24 ( left ) and hubsand @entity25 , @entity1 , were surprised weeks ago when they learned they were expecting three new additions to their family during a routine sonogram ' is this a joke ? ' : mr @entity9 asked the technician to double check when she told the couple they were expecting triplets while triplets have become more common with the rise of methods such as in vitro fertilization , having an identical trio naturally , where one egg is fertilized and splits into three separate embyros , is rare			1
@entity79 is commonly reported as the odds of having natural identical triplets , though estimates range from one in 60,000 to one in 200million			1
there were in 4,600 triplets out of nearly 4 million @entity86 births in 2012 according to date from the @entity87			2
however there is no record of how many were identical or how many births involved fertility treatments			0
the mother , who works as a part - time nurse , had hoped to wait until mid-february to give birth , with multiples often born early			0
@entity8 's rapidly growing belly lead her to believe that there would be more than one child , though she and husband @entity25 did not expect triplets			2
she is seen here at her baby shower friends and family held a baby shower in january for the happy parents , who said that the triplets are a blessing			0
the couple will get help raising the girls from nearby relatives , and are buying in bulk for their bulging brood			0
' thank goodness for @entity115 and @entity116 , ' mrs @entity24 , who estimates that the babies will go through 7,000 diapers in their first year , told @entity120			0
mr @entity9 works as a supervisor at a church - building company , and the couple hope to be able to continue working while splitting time caring for the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 along with their two - year - old son , @entity124			1
though friends have warned them about the difficulties ahead , the couple said they do n't view the children as an inconvenience , but as something that ' makes marriage a family '			0
the @entity135 expect their new children in the coming weeks and may try to keep track of their girls by giving them different nail polish colors after first finding out about the triplets in september , mrs @entity24 has been preparing to give birth for the past several months			1
she first started having contractions at work in december and still experiences them frequently			0
a rapidly growing belly first made her suspect that there was more than one child even before she knew ' just last night , i felt a kick on my left and a hit on my right ; then , i ’ll have one push here , one push there , and i ’ll have one pounce on my bladder , ' she said			0
the babies will be born through caesarean section , as the risks of naturally birthing the triplets are too high			0
the sisters will likely stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for several weeks			0
however doctors have said that @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 appear to be developing healthily .			1
