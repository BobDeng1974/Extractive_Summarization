@entity1 's warning @entity2 ended the day in a strong position , but it ’s worth bearing in mind what happened in @entity7 in 2009			1
like thursday , @entity2 declared just before tea , leaving @entity9 a hefty target ( 503 )			1
but the home side ’s lower order hung on — with @entity13 batting as high as nine — and forced an unlikely draw			0
@entity16 celebrates with his @entity2 team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity19 @entity20 with @entity22 knocking the ball around the park , his partner @entity21 thought he ’d get in on the act — but instead smashed a loopy ball from @entity27 straight into his team - mate ’s arm			1
the @entity31 batsman was left with a nasty bruise but was fine to carry on			0
@entity2 's @entity22 receives treatment on the field after he was struck by a shot from @entity21 @entity36 is secure after @entity22 and @entity40 made centuries in the first test , @entity39 ’s 142 - run contribution has been largely overlooked			1
the @entity43 has emerged as a consistent performer for @entity2 , passing 50 runs seven times in his last six tests			1
@entity39 plays a shot during his 142 - run total on day four at the sir @entity50 @entity53 @entity52 umpire @entity54 dropped a bit of a clanger in the afternoon			2
@entity57 bowled at @entity21 ’s leg stump and hit the batsman on the bottom of his left pad , earning an lbw call from @entity54			0
@entity21 reviewed the decision and to no - one ’s surprise , @entity64 showed the ball was missing leg stump by so much it did n’t even pitch in line			0
umpire @entity54 dropped a bit of a clanger in the afternoon with his lbw call on @entity21 a @entity74 ? thursday 's free - scoring was assisted greatly by a toiling @entity9 spin attack , prompting many — including sir @entity77 — to question the absence of leg - spinner @entity79 , who ran out @entity40 as a sub fielder on wednesday			2
@entity2 fans may remember his excellent three - wicket haul against @entity85 at the @entity86			2
leg spinner @entity79 was conspicuous in his absence for @entity9 against @entity2 @entity88 elsewhere , @entity89 and @entity90 — both overlooked for this @entity92 — were in action for @entity94 as they lost to @entity95			1
@entity89 laboured to 27 from 30 balls , but @entity90 helped himself to 23 off 19 and two wickets			0
