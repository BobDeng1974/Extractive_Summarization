by @entity1 reporter published : 17:30 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 26 february 2013 @entity2 has expressed her ' deep regret ' at disappointment she caused after switching her @entity6 gown at the last minute			0
the @entity8 star , who won the @entity9 on sunday night , had planned to wear a gown by her good friend @entity11 , but at the last minute elected to wear a pale pink @entity13 creation instead			1
in a statement issued to @entity15 , she explained : ' it came to my attention late saturday night that there would be a dress worn to the @entity6 that is remarkably similar to the @entity11 i had intended to wear , and so i decided it was best for all involved to change my plans			1
' given the cold shoulder : @entity2 decided last - minute to wear @entity13 to the @entity6 , despite being expected to wear a custom - made gown by her long - time favorite designer and friend , @entity11 she insisted that the trade was not intended as a snub to @entity11 , who designed the wedding gown she wore to marry husband @entity31 last september			1
' though i love the dress i did wear , it was a difficult last minute decision as i had so looked forward to wearing @entity11 in honor of the deep and meaningful relationship i have enjoyed with the house and with @entity11 himself , ' she continued			1
' i deeply regret any disappointment caused			0
' too similar ? ms @entity2 's decision was prompted when she saw @entity43 's @entity42 gown , which was apparently very similar to the @entity11 number she had been set to wear ms @entity2 made reference to the gown switch when interviewed by @entity47 on the red carpet on sunday			2
' i did n't know what i was wearing until about three hours ago , ' she told him			0
' this was the one that spoke to me in the end			0
' her dress choice undoubtedly came as a surprise to @entity11 , whose fashion house sent out a press release just before the awards show stating that it would be dressing @entity2 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
according to @entity65 , the actress 's impulse decision was prompted when she saw @entity43 's @entity42 lace gown , which was apparently very similar to the @entity11 number she was slated to wear			2
memorable fashion moment : @entity11 designed the romantic pale pink gown and headpiece that ms @entity2 wore to marry @entity31 last september close friends : @entity11 ( pictured with ms @entity2 in one of his designs at the @entity6 ) has said that the actress is ' like my daughter ' wanting to stand out from her @entity8 co-star , ms @entity2 reportedly ' freaked out , ' requiring her stylist @entity78 to call in several different dresses just before the event			1
whatever the reason for her outfit choice , the 30 - year - old certainly caused a stir in her backless pink satin @entity13 gown - complete with a very perky bust line - which she accessorized with a sparkling @entity89 necklace			2
ms @entity2 has a long history of friendship with 80 - year - old @entity11 , who has said of the actress : ' she 's a very good friend of mine			0
she 's like my daughter			0
' she has worn a number of his creations to awards ceremonies - including the bold red strapless number she wore to host the @entity6 in 2011 .			0

the actress decided to wear a pale pink @entity13 dress to the @entity102 instead , after learning that another star would be wearing something too similar to her chosen @entity11 gown
the @entity11 press *office* had already sent out a press release *announcing* her choice of gown , *unaware* of the last - minute switch
