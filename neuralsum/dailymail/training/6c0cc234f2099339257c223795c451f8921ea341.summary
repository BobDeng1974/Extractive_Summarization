by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 22 august 2013 an artist has created a set of hyper - realistic paintings of famous landmarks around the world which appear to be reflected in the lenses of a pair of sunglasses			1
the pictures by @entity10 are so lifelike they have often been mistaken for photography			0
over the last five years he has painted the @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , the @entity17 museum in @entity18 , the @entity18 skyline , the seaside at @entity19 and @entity20			1
detail : unbelievably , these images are not photographs but astonishingly detailed paintings by talented artist @entity10 dark mirror : @entity10 , 40 , from @entity26 , said : ' using the reflection of the sunglasses permitted me to explore the spatial and environmental surroundings in a distorted and warped miniature fashion ' to create the lifelike compositions , he takes pictures of the locations and a model wearing sunglasses , before he gets to work on a canvas with an airbrush and acrylic paint			1
his pieces range in size from 11 by 8 inches to 5ft by 6.5 ft and can take from two weeks to seven months to complete			2
they range in price from £ 3,000 to £ 22,000			1
@entity10 , 40 , from @entity26 , said : ' in 2008 i made a painting where a model was wearing sunglasses			1
' i realised then that using the reflection of the sunglasses permitted me to explore the spatial and environmental surroundings in a distorted and warped miniature fashion			0
' all my paintings are based and sourced using the camera , which i use the only to assist me with gathering information			0
painstaking : his masterpieces take from two weeks to seven months to complete and sell for up to £ 22,000 prepared : the artist says inspiration can strike at any time and he is always equipped with his camera and a selection of sunglasses @entity60 to the soul : in this entrancing image , @entity15 is captured on a cloudy day ' my method involves using multiple source photographs and then throughout the painting process i add or remove detail , alter depth , add textures , form and colour values			1
' this allows me to and create an illusion of a reality not seen in any single photographic source , and my paintings therefore appear clearer and more distinct than a photograph			0
' most of my paintings are planned before i visit any locations with the camera , especially the iconic buildings which are instantly recognisable			0
these include @entity14 , @entity15 , the @entity82 or the @entity18 skyline paintings			2
' inspiration for some paintings can evolve from some unlikely moments			0
i 'm always equipped with my camera and a selection of sunglasses			0
' i get mostly positive reactions to my artwork , but there are always some negative responses to contend with			0
' the most common being " it looks like a photograph so why bother painting it when a camera can take the picture in less than a second ? "			2
' @entity10 's pictures feature the @entity82 in @entity18 , as well as the city 's skyline , the seaside in @entity19 and @entity105 's @entity104 and @entity20 mind - blowing : mr @entity107 says most people admire his work , but some question why he does it when a camera can achieve quicker results more real than real : to create the lifelike compositions , he takes pictures of the locations and a model wearing sunglasses , before taking to a canvas with an airbrush and acrylic paint			1
