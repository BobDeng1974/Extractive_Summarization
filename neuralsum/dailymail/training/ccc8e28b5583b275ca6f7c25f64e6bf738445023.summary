by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 10:21 est , 11 january 2013 inspiration : the late @entity2 competed in marathons despite having terminal cancer she defied her doubters and became an inspiration when she achieved numerous feats of endurance despite suffering from terminal cancer			1
now @entity2 's husband has admitted even he was stunned when his wife announced she intended to run a marathon after she had been given just six months to live			1
@entity13 shared his wife 's inspiring story on the @entity16 after announcing a new marathon will be staged in @entity18 in her memory this year			2
the widower told presenters @entity21 and @entity23 how his wife had never run before her cancer diagnosis in the summer of 2000 when she was only 36 years old			1
but after being told she had only six months to live , she decided to take on the endurance challenge			2
he said : ' it was preposterous			0
she was told she was not going to see next spring and there she was saying she was going to run the @entity29 in april			2
' @entity13 added : ' she did everything i thought was n't possible for her			0
she was desperately ill with a lot of cancer in her bones			0
i never for a minute thought she could do it			0
' but when she went out in the month before the marathon and did an 18 mile training run , i thought this is serious , she 's really going to do it			0
she should have been dead and there she was on the start line of the @entity29			0
' @entity2 went on to live for another seven years after her advanced metastatic breast cancer diagnosis which @entity13 said was largely thanks to advances in cancer treatments			1
but he added he was certain taking up sport also helped prolong her life			0
not only did getting fit make her more ' robust ' physically so she could better handle her grueling chemotherapy treatments , it also helped her mentally			0
the marathon gave @entity2 a chance to ' take control ' at a time when she was ' losing everything ' , @entity13 explained			1
' it meant cancer stopped defining her '			0
the mother - of - three built up to running the @entity29 by taking part in 5k to half marathon races and after finishing the event in a respectable time of 4 hours and 53 minutes , decided she would n't stop there			1
remarkable : the mother - of - three went on to complete an @entity65 and raise nearly £ 2m for charity pedal power : she also cycled across @entity69 to boost charity coffers she went on to complete an @entity65 ( comprised of a 2.4 mile swim , 112 mile bike ride and 26.2 mile run ) and then a 4,200 mile bike @entity74 , from @entity76 to @entity18			1
remarkably after completing the @entity65 - an event that can break the fittest of athletes - @entity13 said @entity2 did n't need painkillers for a week as she was on such a high from her achievement			1
' if someone has had a cancer diagnosis , they do n't have to run a marathon but hopefully her story will give people some hope that diagnosis is not the end of your life ' he said : ' i expected her to wake up the next day and be a complete shell but she had no painkillers for a week			1
' the endorphins she got from doing the race kept the pain at bay			0
that was the only week in seven years when she did n't take painkillers - after the @entity65			1
' i 'm not a medical man , i do n't understand how the body works but there has to be something in that			0
' @entity2 's achievements meant her whole family were thrust into the public eye and the @entity111 man admitted they found this difficult to begin with			0
while many people were supportive of @entity2 , others criticised her for the challenges she was undertaking while ill and some even questioned whether she really had terminal cancer at all			1
legacy continues : her husband @entity13 is helping to stage the @entity120 in her memory but @entity13 revealed while they would never have sought attention , when @entity2 's story first started making headlines , they decided to embrace it in order to make as much money for charity as they could			1
by the time of her death in 2007 at the age of 43 , she had raised almost £ 2million for charity			0
she also won numerous accolades including a cbe and inspired people around the world to change their lives through her example			0
@entity13 said he hopes @entity2 's story continues to make a difference to people 's lives			2
' if someone has had a cancer diagnosis , they do n't have to run a marathon but hopefully her story will give people some hope that diagnosis is not the end of your life , you can still have a fulfilling life , ' he said			2
now @entity13 and his family are keeping @entity2 's legacy alive and continuing to raise money for good causes through staging various sporting events in the @entity161			1
@entity29 challenge : celebs including @entity164 , pictured front left with @entity13 , are supporting the event which will take place in @entity18 in october through @entity2 ’s for all events , they already stage the @entity169 , @entity18 , @entity170 and @entity171 , @entity172 and walking and swimming festivals			1
but now their jewel in the crown will be the @entity120 which they hope will become a not - to - be - missed event in the @entity181 sporting calendar			0
the race , on a flat and scenic course around @entity184 and surrounding countryside , will be held on sunday , 20 october			0
entries are now open and participants are encouraged to donate money to the @entity189 or raise money for a charity of their choice			1
however , there is no pressure to raise a certain amount in order to take part			0
do the impossible : @entity13 said on the day of the marathon , he hopes to see people ' achieve things they have never dreamed of like @entity2 did ' as well as raising money for charity , @entity13 hopes the race will make a difference to people 's lives by encouraging them to get fit and enjoy taking part in sport			1
@entity13 and his daughter will also be running and he said he is looking forward to seeing people achieve what they thought might not be possible by completing the 26.2 mile course			2
he added that the best part will be ' seeing people achieve things they have never dreamed of like @entity2 did - that 's success			2
