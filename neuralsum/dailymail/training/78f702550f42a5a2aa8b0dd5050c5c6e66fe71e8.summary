by @entity0 children who grew up with parents addicted to drink and drugs have revealed the terrifying toll it took on their childhood			1
while their homes should have been a place of safety and refuge , for @entity11 and @entity12 ( not their real names ) they were associated with fear			1
her situation due to her often drunk single mother became so bad that @entity11 , from @entity17 , ran away from home at the age of just 11			1
volatile : @entity11 was so scared of her mother when she 'd had a drink , she ran away age 11 preferring to sleep rough than be at home ( pictures posed by models ) she told @entity26 : ' i never knew my dad and i was an only child			1
my mum and i led a very chaotic lifestyle : one year we lived in 12 different places			2
the houses were all in bad condition and always dirty			0
' my relationship with my mum was n't good			0
she 'd had two or three partners who she had turbulent relationships with			2
there were loads of rows , sometimes violent ones late into the night			0
things were smashed and at the weekend she would drink heavily			0
' i was frightened of her when she was drunk as she was very unpredictable			1
i was really stressed and not sleeping			0
there was no - one to turn to , only my mum , and that was n't working			0
it all got too much for me , i was utterly miserable , so i ran away from home			1
i was an 11 - year - old girl wandering around by myself at night and i was scared			1
' she added : ' it was freezing and i was terrified that someone would hurt me			0
but frightened as i was , i could n't face going home			2
' it was thanks to @entity60 that she did n't have to sleep rough			1
they tried to help her reestablish a relationship with her mother but when that failed , they found her a refuge and then a foster home to stay in till she was 16			1
... at school i 'd hear people talk about the fun things they did with their parents and i 'd think " why ca n't i have that ? " she said : through all those difficult years @entity60 was there for me			1
if they had n't helped me when i ran away and i was alone in the park overnight i shudder to think what could have happened to me			1
' whenever things got really bad , i called them and they helped me through it			2
@entity60 always listened to me and believed what i said and having my counsellor at the end of the phone made me feel as though i mattered and there was always someone there for me			1
i really do n't know what i would have done without @entity60			1
' meanwhile , @entity12 's experience growing up with a drug addict father is equally heartbreaking			1
@entity12 , from @entity93 , who is now 18 , said : ' i knew from a young age that my life was different to other children			1
i 'd see my dad fall over or just be asleep on the sofa by 6pm			2
i used to think " why is he falling asleep , he 's done nothing all day so why is he tired ? " i 'd sit next to him and clap or make another noise , anything just to try and keep him awake as i knew something was n't right			2
' we always used to have lots of people in the house too			0
they 'd arrive at weird times like 2am or 6am and they 'd be really noisy			2
my dad had told me that my mother was in prison for drugs and i slowly began to realise as i got older that he was a drug user too			1
' @entity12 said as a result of his father 's problem , he lived in squalor and fear			1
but it was only when he went to a school friend 's house that he realise how different his life was to his peers			0
concern : @entity60 carried out 5,323 counselling sessions with children worried about their parents ' abuse of drink or drugs - up from 2,509 the previous year he said : ' i remember going to a friend 's house and his family all sat up to be table for the meal and i thought " what are they doing ? " i was n't used to being in a family environment and spending time with family			1
' at home our lives were very separate as i 'd spend a lot of time in my room to get away from my dad and his friends who were taking drugs downstairs			1
he would never come and tuck me in , instead he 'd pass out on the sofa			2
he added : ' when i went to friends ' houses i realised that they had more things than me , like playstations and mobiles , and i did n't understand why i could n't have them			0
i felt lost and lonely			0
' at school i 'd hear people talk about the fun things they did with their parents and i 'd think " why ca n't i have that ? " there was only a couple of friends who i trusted that came inside my house as i did n't want others to see what state it was in			2
some of their parents would n't let me them come round as they knew my dad was doing drugs			0
' @entity12 recalls one particularly horrific experience			1
' when i was about nine , a man overdosed in my house			2
i remember walking upstairs and seeing him on the floor in our bathroom next to some heroin and a needle covered in blood			2
i did n't know what to do and i was scared but my dad just told me to go to my room , ' he said			0
it was shortly after this that he found salvation via @entity60			1
he was referred to the @entity193 's @entity192 programme which does group work with children whose parents have drug or alcohol problems			0
he said : ' i was a bit nervous the first time i went as i knew why i was there but i did n't know what to expect			0
i loved it straight away as it helped me to realise that i was n't the only person in that situation - other young people were going through the same thing			0
' @entity11 and @entity12 have shared her story after figures released today by @entity60 have shown a shock rise in the number of children contacting them about their parents ' drinking and drug - taking			1
the number of children counselled by @entity60 because their parents were drinking too much - or taking drugs - has more than doubled last year , averaging 15 counselling sessions a day to the free , 24 - hour helpline			1
@entity60 carried out 5,323 counselling sessions with children worried about their parents ' abuse of drink or drugs - up from 2,509 the previous year			1
... when i was about nine , a man overdosed in my house			0
i remember walking upstairs and seeing him on the floor in our bathroom next to some heroin and a needle covered in blood most of the children counselled were 12 to 15 years old , although one in 10 were of primary school age			1
the figures contrast with a long - term fall in violent crime in @entity244 and @entity245 , thought to be partially influenced by the rising cost of alcohol			0
the charity said further research is needed to explain the sudden increase but it would appear that more children are witnessing drunken behaviour and experiencing violence at home , or they are more aware that help is available			2
many children told @entity60 that they lived in fear of their parents ' anger , with one in six saying they 'd been physically hurt by their mother or father when they were under the influence			1
some reported living in dirty and even dangerous surroundings , lacking essentials because money was frittered on alcohol or drugs			0
children spoke of feeling helpless and not knowing where to go for support			0
shock rise : more children are witnessing drunken behaviour and experiencing violence at home according to statistics from @entity60 ( posed by models ) @entity279 , head of @entity60 , said : ' these shocking @entity60 statistics are sadly only one small piece of the jigsaw			1
official estimates are that more than 250,000 children in the @entity285 have parents with drug problems , and three in 10 children live with at least one binge - drinking parent			2
' it 's heart - breaking that so many young people struggle alone because they do not know where to go for help or are unsure of what might happen if they speak to someone			0
they may fear being taken away from their families by social services and put into care and believe that they are protecting their family by keeping quiet			0
' some children tell us their parents are under stress and it may be that they are using drink and drugs to blot out worries about jobs , money or housing issues			0
but whatever the reasons behind the rise , it 's vital that anyone who knows a parent with drink or drug problems takes action to get that family help so that their children are protected			0
' @entity12 said the support of the charity was invaluable to him			1
he explained : ' it was good to have the @entity193 in my life as they provided me with a consistency that was missing at home and gave me someone to talk to			0
' going there made me want to help other people and i started to help deliver the @entity192 sessions to other young people			0
i â€™m also going to university to do a social worker degree			0
