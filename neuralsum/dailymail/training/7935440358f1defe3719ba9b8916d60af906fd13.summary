by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 17:46 est , 28 september 2013 all dolled up : pop star @entity1 was born with a cleft palate with her striking red hair and model ’s cheekbones , it is impossible to imagine that pop star @entity1 as anything other than beautiful			1
as a member of the international chart - topping band @entity10 , she won legions of fans and wowed audiences around the world			2
but her face – and life – has not always been so perfect			2
for @entity1 was born with a cleft lip and palate , a common birth defect that leaves babies with the upper lip and the roof of the mouth split apart			1
it took a string of gruelling operations to correct , meaning that @entity1 ’s childhood was punctuated by annual surgery from the age of just six months until she was 16			1
in between the difficult recovery periods , she found herself bullied for the way she looked			2
but her pop career gave her the chance to show people that physical imperfections can be overcome			2
@entity1 took to telling audiences about her cleft lip and palate during performances while she stood on stage with bandmates including x factor judge @entity42			1
‘ i ’d say , “ hi , i ’m @entity1			1
you may not know i was born with a birth defect but growing up i felt different and not pretty			0
i ’m sure everyone has something that makes them feel different , and i invite you to embrace that because that ’s what makes you special and unique			0
” ‘ there ’d be this huge cheer and i ’d get fan mail saying thank you because this person or their daughter had a cleft lip or palate			1
’ the 38 - year - old adds : ‘ people need to know that beauty is n’t just on the outside – it ’s on the inside			2
it ’s kind of crazy that i was in a pop group that revolved around image when for so long i had this defect that could have held me back			0
’ the condition is now rarely seen in children in the @entity69 because it is corrected soon after birth , but it remains the most common facial birth defect			0
one in every 700 babies in the @entity69 is born with a cleft			2
the type and severity varies widely			0
some are born with either a cleft lip or a cleft palate , but around half of those affected have both			1
it was @entity1 ’s love of performing that helped her become resilient			1
by the age of ten , she was having lessons in dance , piano and drama , and she also took up rhythmic gymnastics			2
eventually she was selected for the @entity91 national team			0
but despite countless operations , her face remained marked throughout adolescence – and she was even told by one talent agent not to get her hopes up about a career on stage because of her appearance			0
scarred youth : @entity1 , pictured as a toddler , went through annual operations throughout her childhood and suffered from bullying as she grew up after a major operation at the age of eight , which took a piece of bone from her thigh to build the hard palate in the top of her mouth , @entity1 had to have more surgery to correct the appearance of her scar			1
‘ i ’d be so excited , thinking this operation would fix it , and then i would be disappointed as my lips still looked different , ’ she recalls			0
@entity1 also developed an underbite , a common complication of cleft lip and palate as jaw growth can be disturbed by the recurrent surgery			1
her underbite worsened from the age of 12 until it reached the point where she did n’t recognise herself , and at 16 she underwent major surgery to correct that too			1
the repeated operations meant that she had to learn how to use her voice again			0
‘ i had to relearn where your tongue is supposed to go and where the different sounds are			0
i taught myself how to whistle again too			0
but there are still sounds i ca n’t make			0
’ @entity1 ’s final operation took place when she was 18 , when bone was taken from her head to build a bridge in her nose			1
thankfully , treatments have improved dramatically since then			0
@entity144 , consultant cleft surgeon at the @entity147 regional cleft unit in @entity148 , says : ‘ the @entity69 leads the world in cleft care , and while 30 years ago children would have 17 or 18 operations , we avoid that now			1
’ doll domination : @entity1 , far right , with her @entity10 band - mates @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity42 and @entity159 at the 2005 @entity160 these days , there are only three ‘ must - have ’ operations during childhood			1
the first is a lip repair , usually done at three months , which also fixes the hard palate in the roof of the mouth			1
the second is a soft - palate repair at the back of the throat at about nine months			1
then , at around eight years , bone is taken from the patient ’s hip or shin and put into the gap in the top of the mouth			2
orthodontic work is needed in the early teenage years to align the teeth properly			0
the condition may also cause ear problems – children under three need monitoring for glue ear , which can affect hearing and impede speech			0
half of all @entity69 children with the condition will need speech therapy			0
a final operation can take place on the nose between the ages of 18 and 20 as patients sometimes have problems breathing through the nostrils			1
despite the excellent treatment , cleft lip and palate – which can be detected in foetuses at the 20 - week scan – remains grounds for abortion in the @entity69			1
@entity1 was horrified to find that was the case			2
‘ i ca n’t believe a doctor would perform an abortion when this is correctable with no residual physical disability , especially now we ’ve come so far in this field , ’ she says			0
she did not even take the cleft palate scan when she was pregnant with her daughter , @entity213 , who is now 18 months			1
‘ i was terrified she ’d have to go through what i went through , so i was overjoyed when i looked at her for the first time			0
she was amazing – perfect in every way			0
’ @entity1 is an ambassador for the @entity219			2
