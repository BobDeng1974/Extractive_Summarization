the unprecedented scale of the @entity2 operation which failed to hold back the @entity4 tide in @entity5 and @entity6 can be laid bare today			1
leaked emails sent by the party ’s @entity9 ’ @entity8 show that in the 54 days since mp @entity13 ’s defection to @entity4 , there were around 100 separate visits to the constituency by cabinet ministers , including five by the prime minister			1
some 246 conservative mps – 80 per cent of the total – hit the campaign trail , with so many there that they were asked to sit in offices stuffing envelopes rather than knocking doors , amid reports voters were sick and tired of constant canvassing			1
@entity4 ’s triumph – its second by - election win in weeks – shook all three main parties			1
@entity46 declared there were now no no - go areas for his party and neither the @entity2 nor @entity50 could hope to win next year ’s general election outright			0
but @entity2 jitters were limited by the smaller - than - expected majority , with senior @entity54 , including @entity55 and @entity56 , speaking supportively			0
@entity4 had forecast a win by 15 percentage points or more just days ago , but mr @entity13 won by 2,900 votes , or just 7 points			1
‘ it is n’t big enough , ’ said one mp sceptical about the party leadership of mr @entity13 ’s majority			1
‘ if you ’re an mp flirting with defection and you look at those numbers in a by - election when people want to kick the government , you have to be thinking you would n’t hold on to your seat at the @entity51			1
’ on november 4 , mr @entity28 ( centre ) with @entity31 ( left ) , the new @entity2 candidate for @entity5 and @entity6 , were shown around the @entity77 site in @entity34 , @entity35 on november 11 , mr @entity28 spoke to pupils of @entity79 in @entity5 , @entity35 and on november 18 , mr @entity28 and ms @entity31 , visited a company in @entity5 mr @entity28 said : ‘ i ’m absolutely determined to win this seat back at the next general election			1
because anything other than a @entity2 government will put our recovery at risk and mean @entity88 in @entity89			0
’ bookmakers have installed the conservatives as favourites to retake the seat in may ’s election			0
emails prepared by the @entity9 ’ office show that at least 100 visits were made to @entity5 by cabinet ministers , with each member asked to go five times , and mps to make three visits at their own expense			1
the emails reveal that 246 mps made at least one visit , and most had made several			2
mr @entity28 said he would ‘ lead from the front ’ by doing the same , but his final two visits to local businesses , as @entity4 surged in the polls , were notably low - key			1
@entity4 and @entity50 believe the @entity111 must also have come close to the spending limit for a by - election – of £ 100,000 – after holding an expensive open primary vote of residents to choose their candidate			1
the party also hired no fewer than four shops in the constituency to act as bases			2
every saturday , buses full of young activists – so - called @entity123 , who were used to great effect in the @entity126 by - election the @entity111 won earlier this year – arrived to pound the streets			0
one minister was quoted at the start of the campaign as saying it would be ‘ like @entity126 on crack cocaine ’			2
the @entity111 ’ operation to try to secure the seat for their candidate , marine surveyor @entity31 , reached fever pitch on polling day as hundreds of activists , including mps , went canvassing			1
miss @entity31 had used a public meeting to appeal to voters from the @entity50 , @entity143 and @entity144 to vote tactically for the @entity111 in order to keep @entity4 out			1
and on the final day , thousands of glossy personalised leaflets – bearing the name of each voter – were sent to likely @entity2 voters , encouraging them to go to the polls			2
one mp , who is on the @entity152 of the party , said they and several colleagues were ‘ incandescent ’ about a letter @entity157 sent to voters , approved by @entity158			1
despite not once mentioning she was a conservative , it mentioned @entity4 twice			1
it also mentioned ‘ uncontrolled immigration ’ and the fact some local people felt unsafe on their high street due to crime , in a way that critics said made it appear the issues were linked			0
miss @entity31 denied she had intended a link			0
the mp said : ‘ a lot of us thought it was deeply unpleasant			2
’ @entity175 , director of research at pollster @entity177 , said : ‘ all mps were instructed to visit the constituency at least three times and over a hundred mps did so on multiple occasions ; @entity28 himself made five visits			1
the party had shipped in activists from across the country to bombard the constituency with canvassing – their resources extended as far as being able to pull off a logistically impressive 6am mail drop to households across the seat on the morning of the vote			1
‘ despite all of this , the party failed to retain a seat with a 10,000 - vote majority , against an opposition party which had not even fielded a candidate at the previous election			2
the implications for the @entity2 are potentially dire			0
’ @entity204 accused @entity205 of playing a game of ' political snakes and ladders ' on @entity208 @entity204 today accused the @entity209 of ‘ political game - playing ’ after he was repeatedly asked about the prime minister ’s failure at the ballot box			0
in a hostile exchange on @entity208 ’s pm , the chief whip told presenter @entity205 he was playing a game of ‘ political snakes and ladders ’ rather than asking about issues of substance			0
after mr @entity205 accused mr @entity204 of dodging a question about whether he should resign if there are more defections to @entity4 , the former education secretary seemed to become frustrated			2
‘ your question was , if i may say so , the type of political game - playing that puts people off @entity209 interviewers because of instead of asking about policy you ’re asking about position , ’ he told mr @entity224			0
‘ one of the things people dislike about politics is the way that commentators instead of talking about issues of substance , such as employment or inflation , play a game of snakes and ladders , and who is up and who is down			0
’ mr @entity204 said the @entity2 were on course for victory in may ’s general election despite suffering a second drubbing at the ballot box in just six weeks			0
when repeatedly pressed to explain why mr @entity28 ‘ ca n’t win ’ , mr @entity204 insisted he ‘ secured a bigger swing than any leader since 1930s ’ at the last general election and is ‘ winning the economic argument ’			0
he added that ‘ there is no one to match @entity28 in terms of the strengths of leadership ’ among current politicians			0
asked if he would resign as chief whip if another @entity2 defects to @entity4 , he told the programme : ‘ i ’m convinced that nobody will so the matter does n’t arise			2
’ mr @entity204 has previously said that there are not too many immigrants in @entity269 – a key @entity4 claim – but he refused to repeat the comments in an interview with @entity273 last night			2
queue of others waiting to defect gloats @entity46 @entity46 today predicted that more mps would defect to @entity4 next year			1
arch conservative eurosceptic @entity277 flanked @entity2 defector @entity13 as he was sworn in as @entity4 ’s second mp , raising speculation he may be next to jump ship			1
@entity4 leader mr @entity46 suggested @entity2 mps facing a threat from @entity50 in northern constituencies would be the most likely to see their future in his party , and mentioned a list of five of the most likely			1
some have ‘ no chance of winning on a blue rosette but might do on a purple rosette ’ at the general election , he said			0
asked who he was thinking of , he gave no names but referred to a list drawn up by academic @entity296 of the five most likely @entity111 to defect to cling on to their seats			0
winner and loser : @entity301 , right , and prime minister @entity28 , left , today it includes @entity303 , mp for @entity304 , who is already quitting in may , @entity305 in @entity306 , @entity307 in @entity308 and @entity309 in the @entity310			2
all have denied they will defect			0
the fifth , @entity313 and @entity314 mp @entity56 , said recently that ‘ you should never say never in politics ’			0
another who has denied he will defect is @entity319 , @entity2 mp for @entity320 in @entity35 , who mr @entity46 said he had spoken to but would not say when , or what they discussed			0
mr @entity46 did not expect more mps to join @entity4 straightaway , but expected some to reach a decision over @entity326			1
he said : ‘ i would be very surprised if there were n’t defections of @entity323 between now and the general election			0
’ he had spoken to @entity50 figures , but they were more scared of a voter backlash .			0
