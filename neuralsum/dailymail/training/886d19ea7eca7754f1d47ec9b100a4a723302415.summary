ask @entity0 who the best player in the world is and his answer is emphatic : ' @entity4			1
' on wednesday night , the @entity7 welcomes the @entity9 superstar with open arms as the @entity11 plays host to a mouth - watering international between @entity14 and @entity15			1
of course , the likelihood is that @entity4 wo n't play the full 90 minutes			2
but who cares ? even a brief glimpse of the great man on the green grass of @entity11 will be an unforgettable treat for the 17,000 fans expected to be in attendance			0
@entity0 ( left ) says @entity4 is the best player in the world , and has the hunger to win more and more @entity4 practices his shooting as @entity14 train at @entity29 's @entity28 last week , @entity4 created history by equalling @entity33 's all - time @entity32 goalscoring record with a brace at @entity35			1
by doing so , he instantly poured scorn over bizarre comments made by @entity14 's national boss @entity38			1
@entity38 , who lasted just one year in charge at @entity9 , voiced concern that the 27 - year - old ' may never capture his best form again '			1
' i do n't know if we 'll have the chance to see it happen , ' @entity38 told @entity47 sports daily , @entity48			0
' it 's like when people compare @entity9 now to what they were like under @entity52			2
' admittedly , there have been doubts over @entity4 ’s fitness			0
he ’s played every possible minute for @entity9 in @entity56 so far this season			0
@entity14 's players warmed up for their behind - closed - doors game against @entity29 's @entity61 side and naturally , his form took a dip as he strived to get over the agony of @entity14 's @entity66 final defeat by @entity67			1
but with his match - winning double in @entity69 , he proved he is still the menacing @entity4 of old			2
he now sits proudly at the top of the queue to eclipse the @entity73 feat of @entity74 legend @entity33 - and one ahead of his arch - nemesis , @entity75			0
the two will again go head - to - head at the beginning of december in their battle to land the coveted @entity81 award			0
victory for @entity4 , who was named the best player at the @entity66 last summer despite @entity14 's @entity85 heartache , would surely coronate him as the game 's best ever			1
the @entity9 superstar listens to @entity14 coach @entity38 during the training session but for song , @entity29 's on - loan midfielder from @entity9 , there is no doubt that title already belongs to his mercurial friend			1
oh … i think this guy is fantastic			0
he ’s the best player i have ever seen in my life , ' says @entity0 , who spent the past two seasons playing alongside the diminutive genius at the @entity101			2
' honestly , i ’ve played with a lot of great players in my career			0
i was very lucky to play with players like @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 ... it was a privilege for me			0
' and then i went to @entity9 to play with @entity110 , @entity111 … and , of course , @entity4			1
' @entity29 ’s under 21 side saw first - hand how brilliant the great man is when @entity14 played a practice game against them on tuesday evening at the club ’s @entity118 base			1
song contests with @entity4 during @entity122 's 2 - 1 win over @entity9 in 2011 at the @entity123 so what separates @entity4 from the rest ? his incredible hunger and desire , according to @entity0			1
' for me , @entity4 is one of the players who is just unbelievable , ’ he adds			2
' i see young players like @entity131 who is the future best player in the world like this guy			0
' but the level @entity4 is at is just unbelievable			2
@entity4 is up here [ @entity0 stretches his arms far and wide ] … and everyone else is below			1
let ’s just say , it ’s a very big gap			0
' the thing i like about @entity4 is he is so hungry			0
he wants to win everything			0
he ’s won everything but still wants to win more			0
' he ’s a great guy			0
the way he manages himself to try and improve himself is a great example to other players and young boys			0
' song has been in good form since joining @entity29 in the summer from @entity9 on loan @entity0 's own future is uncertain			1
he could return to @entity9 next summer but he is happy at @entity29 , where he has shone so far this season in @entity157 's side			1
perhaps @entity0 could tempt @entity4 to prolong his short - stay in the @entity7 and join him in january ? ' @entity159 ... why not ! it would be good			1
hopefully wednesday wo n't mark the last time we ever see the masterful @entity4 grace @entity164 soil .			2

@entity0 has no doubt who the best player in the world is right now
former team - mate @entity4 is ' unbelievable ' , according to @entity0
@entity0 is currently on loan at @entity29 from @entity4 's side @entity9
@entity4 is in the @entity7 with @entity14 , who are *facing* @entity15 in a friendly at @entity11 on wednesday night
