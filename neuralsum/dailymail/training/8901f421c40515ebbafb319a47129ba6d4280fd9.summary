in the @entity0 rests a medical oddity so unusual that it at first seems a massive hoax			0
dating back to the early 1800s , an isolated family in eastern @entity7 - who can trace their roots back to a @entity5 orphan - started producing children who were blue			1
as a result of a coincidental meeting of recessive genes , intermarriage and inbreeding , members of the @entity16 family were born with a rare condition that made them visibly discoloured			2
feeling blue : due to inbreeding and inter-marriage , a rural family developed a rare skin discolouration the mystery behind the astonishing picture of the @entity24 , which has been baffling people for years , appears to have finally been solved			2
it began when @entity16 , a @entity5 orphan , settled on the banks of eastern @entity7 's @entity28 to claim a land grant in the early 19th century			1
he married a red - haired @entity30 named @entity31 - who had a very pale complexion - and their union formed a genetic mutation that resulted in their descendants being born with blue skin			1
looking at the portrait , they appear to have been either photoshopped or made up to mimic characters from children 's cartoon @entity44 , but science proves that the condition is in fact real			0
rural : the @entity48 lived in an isolated part of eastern @entity7 and had little opportunity to mix with others relations : a photo of @entity55 ' @entity54 and @entity56 , taken around 1915 called methaemoglobinaemia ( commonly known as met - h ) , the condition reduces the individual ’s ability to carry oxygen in their blood			1
as a result , their blood is darker than the colour typically found running through people ’s veins			2
the methaemoglobinaemia condition , or ‘ met - h ’ , reduces someone ’s ability to carry oxygen in the blood , leaving it darker than the colour typically found in veins			1
the @entity16 family intermarried with a neighbouring family for generations , which led to a relatively ‘ pure ’ gene pool , often including the met - h gene			1
but as @entity7 became more populated and more genes came into the @entity16 family tree , there were far fewer children born blue			1
the gene is still around today but has now become statistically insignificant and there are no serious medical problems associated with it			0
because the @entity16 family lived in such an isolated part of the @entity7 , they intermarried with a neighbouring family for generations which led to a relatively ‘ pure ’ gene pool where the met - h gene appeared much more frequently			1
the family was first discovered in 1958 when one of the blue men , @entity97 , who was a descendant of another branch of the @entity16 family , took his white wife to the @entity101 and doctors paid more attention to him than his wife			2
‘ @entity97 was just as blue as @entity107 on a cool summer day , ’ doctor @entity105 told the @entity106 in 1974			0
aside from the stark discoloration of the carrier ’s skin , there are no serious problems associated with the disease			0
in 1980 , a counter-intuitive solution was discovered where the blue person drinks a chemical - filled solution that is itself blue			0
this then turns the carrier ’s blood into a ‘ normal ’ red hue which is then reflected in a change in skin tone			0
@entity125 ( commonly known as met - h ) is a recessive gene ( shown by the small r ) so only produces ' blue ' people in very rare circumstances because of the dispersion of fluids , the solution only lasts for about a day so the carrier would have to drink a serving every day			1
' they were n’t sick ; it was just the way they look			0
they ’re normal people - they ’re good people ' nurse @entity137 as eastern @entity7 has become vastly more populated than the early 19th century , and as more genes are married into the @entity16 family tree , there were far fewer children born with the condition			1
that said , the recessive met - h gene lingers to this day , but it is statistically insignificant now			2
‘ they were n’t sick ; it was just the way they look , ’ said nurse @entity137 in the @entity106 article			0
' they ’re normal people - they ’re good people			0

isolated family in @entity7 started producing blue children in 1800s
@entity5 orphan @entity16 married pale @entity30 @entity31
had seven children , four were blue ; they intermarried with local family
genetic mutation reduces individual ’s ability to carry oxygen in blood
intermarriage led to ' pure ' gene pool which often met ' met - h ' gene
