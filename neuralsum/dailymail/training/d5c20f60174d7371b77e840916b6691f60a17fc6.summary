by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 18:06 est , 30 may 2013 squeezing a person 's leg after they have suffered a stroke could save their life , according to new research			0
experts found that wrapping a compression device around the legs of a stroke patient could reduce the risk of blood clots , which often result in death			1
compression reduces the risk of clots in the veins of the legs by increasing blood flow			1
new research shows that gentle compression of the leg after a stroke could reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis , which commonly affects stroke patients the results of the trial , carried out by @entity30 , revealed that intermittent pneumatic compression ( @entity32 ) , implemented by an inflatable leg wrap , reduced the risk of deep vein thrombosis ( @entity35 ) , which commonly affects stroke patients			1
@entity35 can lead to pulmonary embolism , which blocks patients ' blood vessels in their lungs and can cause heart failure , killing thousands of people each year			2
the study , tested more than 2800 stroke patients in hundreds of hospitals across the @entity46			2
it shows that the wraps can reduce the chances of death when they are worn for several days or weeks after the stroke			2
the necessary @entity32 wraps , costing the @entity53 £ 25 per pair , are inflated for a few seconds , one leg at a time , to compress the veins in the legs every minute or so			1
until now , no treatment has been available that safely reduces the risk of the blood clots in the legs			1
until now , there have been limited treatments to cut the risk of dangerous blood clots in stroke patients current treatments include blood thinning injections , which have been shown to reduce the risk of @entity35 , but these carry an increased risk of bleeding on the brain			1
experts also believe blood thinning injections are not conclusively shown to reduce the risk of dying after stroke			1
around 15 million people suffer a stroke each year worldwide - one third of whom will die			0
another third will become permanently disabled			0
it is the second most common cause of death worldwide			0
professor @entity81 , of the @entity30 's @entity82 , said : ' at last we have a simple , safe and affordable treatment that reduces the risk of @entity35 and e ven appears to reduce the risk of dying after a stroke			1
' we estimate that this treatment could potentially help about 60,000 stroke patients each year in the @entity46			0
if this number were treated , we would prevent about 3000 developing a dvt and perhaps save 1500 lives			0
' we believe that the national guidelines need to be revised in the light of our findings			0
' the current national guidelines have suggested that @entity32 should be considered only where blood thinning injections are unsuccessful or inappropriate , but this research suggests that @entity32 should be used in all patients at high risk of @entity35			2
' dr @entity100 , director of research and information at the @entity102 said : ' following a stroke , the risk of developing blood clots and @entity35 increases considerably which can be extremely dangerous for the patient			1
' at the moment some stroke survivors receive anti-blood clotting medication , however this is n’t effective in everyone			0
' this new device has the potential to save thousands of lives and we would like to see it incorporated into national clinical guidelines			0
' the findings were published in the @entity118 .			0

study revealed that compression reduced the risk of deep vein thrombosis
until now , there has been no treatment to reduces the risk of blood clots
compression wraps would cost the @entity53 as little as £ 25 per pair
