by @entity0 with luminous colours and alien - like features , these mesmerising mushrooms look like they belong on another planet			2
but from glow - in - the - dark caps to delicate pastel gills and even slimy stalks , they all grow on @entity9 in an array of diverse and mysterious forms			1
@entity13 photographer @entity12 , 62 , has spent 12 years snapping the fungi			1
an eerie sight : with luminous colours and alien - like features , these magical mushrooms look like they belong on another planet			2
there are thought to be 65 species of luminescent mushrooms such as the @entity21 pictured - which use a reaction that emits light when water and oxygen are present so they glow 24 hours a day , but are visible at night ‘ this project came together all by itself , ’ said the resident of @entity28 , who started photographing mushrooms across @entity13 in 2002			1
‘ as i collected more and more photos it became obvious that i should do something with them , as it would be such a pity to just collect them and then let them die with me without any one seeing them			0
‘ i am very fortunate in that i live in a place that has plenty of fungi , and when i started photographing fungi , i knew nothing about it			2
hidden treasure : @entity13 photographer @entity12 , 62 , has spent 12 years snapping the fungi , some of which glows in the dark			1
these specimens appear to be holding silver pearls and looks slightly like an oyster deserves a fanfare : this @entity55 fasciatus is known as the ' hairy trumpet ' and looks as it if should be growing on another planet			2
however the fungus can be found in @entity13 woods and forests and often grows from rotting logs			0
these specimens appear to be providng a temporary home for a small stripy insect ‘ now i am learning not only their names and how they survive , but also a little of how they fit into the world and the importance of the role that they play			2
‘ many plants and animals could not survive as they rely on fungi to provide them nutrition ’ from monstrous specimens measuring 16 inches ( 40cm ) in height to tiny fungi just one millimetre in size , mr @entity12 photographs them all			1
lighting up the woods : bioluminescent mushrooms emit light 24 hours per day but are best observed at night			1
there are about 85,000 species in the fungi kingdom and around just 65 of them are thought to be luminescent			1
here , @entity21 illuminate pitch - black woodland gloriously glossy : from monstrous specimens measuring 40cm in height to tiny fungi just one millimetre in size , mr @entity12 photographs them all			1
this specimen has a large , irregular cap that appears to be glossy when they are too small to see with the naked eye , he uses a macro lens to reveal the fungi ’s beauty			1
a fungus is any member of a large group of eukaryotic organisms that includes micro-organisms such as yeasts and moulds , as well as the more familiar mushrooms			1
mr @entity12 said : ‘ i live in an area of @entity111 that used to be an old volcano , so it has rich volcanic soil and lots of rain mainly in the summer			1
alien invasion ? when the fungi are too small to see with the naked eye , he uses a macro lens to reveal their beauty			1
this @entity122 looks a little like an alien			0
the species does not glow - in - the - dark but matures to have a brilliant blue cyan cap diverse : a fungus is any member of a large group of eukaryotic organisms that includes micro-organisms such as yeasts and moulds , as well as the more familiar mushrooms			1
they come in many shapes and sizes			0
@entity138 is pictured left and @entity122 right with its pretty cyan caps could have starred in ghostbusters : @entity141 ( pictured ) is charmingly known as the ' slimp green waxcap ' as its luminous green body is coated in a thick , glutinous substance			0
it only grows in wet rainforests to the south of @entity13 ‘ this is perfect for sub-tropical fungi which thrive in summer and so about half of my photos are taken at my home and the rest mostly from close by			2
‘ my pictures show the beauty in the world , but they also stimulate me to find out more about how the world fits together			0
under the sea ? this @entity55 fasciatus looks as if it should live beneath the waves in a tropical reef but it can be found in the forests of @entity13			0
its delicate gills curl upwards and the caps have delicate hairy details delicate : mr @entity12 lives in an area of @entity111 that used to be a volcano , so it has rich volcanic soil and lots of rain in the summer			1
such conditions are necessary to support incredible structures such as this mushroom , which has impossibly delicate gills like little flowers : @entity179 look like flowers and play an essentialrole in forest ecosystems by helping to break down the litter layer of the forest floor			0
they are small and are often overlooked by collectors ‘ i also try to make the colours true - though the lighting will enhance that at times			0
most people love my fungi photos which encourages me to keep taking them			0
‘ i try to get as many people as possible to see them , in the hope that they will stimulate an interest in fungi , and i think this is working			0
’ it 's best side : the photographer waits for the perfect lighting conditions to showcase the fungi in all their glory			2
@entity204 is pictured , which is also known as the orange fan			0
masses of the fungus can cover dead twigs in the forest it can leave its hat on : @entity213 is also called the ruby bonnet			0
it has a blood - red cap with a darker red dimple at its centre as well as pink gills and a deep red stem			0
it is most commonly found in the south east of @entity13			0

photographer @entity12 from @entity28 , has spent 12 years capturing the mushrooms of @entity111
he photographs large species measuring 16 inches tall to tiny fungi *invisible* to the naked eye using a macro lens
specimens photographed include bioluminescent mushrooms , slimy and delicate fungi as well as some that look like aliens and coral
