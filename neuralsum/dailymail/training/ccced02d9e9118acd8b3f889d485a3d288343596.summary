ready to act : the @entity0 , led by president @entity1 , has cut eurozone interest rates to a record low of 0.5 % in a bid to stimulate growth interest rates in the eurozone were slashed to a record low yesterday in a desperate effort to drag the region out of recession			1
the @entity0 cut benchmark borrowing costs to 0.5 per cent , having held them at 0.75 per cent since july last year			1
it follows weeks of deterioration in the eurozone including a surge in unemployment to an all - time high of more than 19.2million – 12.1 per cent of the workforce – and figures yesterday showed the downturn in manufacturing deepened in april			1
@entity23 ’s factory output fell for the first time this year as the rot spread to the region ’s biggest economy , but @entity29 manufacturers were the worst performing in the single currency bloc , in yet another setback to @entity33 president @entity32			2
the decline in recent weeks , and the @entity0 ’s latest attempt to reverse it , makes a mockery of claims by senior bureaucrats in @entity40 that the crisis is over			2
@entity42 , head of the @entity43 , provoked scorn early this year by claiming the euro was out of the danger zone			0
the single currency fell in value yesterday as @entity0 president @entity1 warned that ‘ weak economic sentiment has extended into the spring of this year ’			1
he added : ‘ the cut in interest rates should contribute to support a recovery later in the year			2
’ but analysts said the measure will do little to stimulate growth and warned that the eurozone faces at least another year of decline			0
@entity59 , a senior commentator at stockbroker @entity60 , said the cut was ‘ too little too late ’			0
interest rates in @entity62 have been at 0.5 per cent since march 2009			0
the move comes amid fears the eurozone economy may not recover later in the year from its recession			1
in theory , a cut helps companies by lowering borrowing costs for banks that have borrowed from the @entity0 so they could loan more			1
false hope ? economists warn the cut may not have much direct effect since banks are not passing on low rates in indebted countries like @entity78 ( above ) that need help the most it also signals the @entity0 's willingness to support the economy			1
economists , however , warn this cut may not have much direct effect since banks are not passing on low rates in indebted countries like @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity78 that need help the most			1
the cut was widely expected after @entity1 said last month the bank stood ready to act			0
economic data over the last month has bolstered the case for action , with unemployment hitting a record high in april , when inflation saw its biggest monthly drop in over four years , to 1.2 per cent			1
' the @entity0 is playing it safe , even though they know the effect is likely to be limited , ' @entity98 analyst @entity97 said of the cut			0
' the key for the market is the tone			0
if the @entity0 comes out with other measures as well to help @entity106 ( small and mid-sized enterprise ) lending that will be positive but if they say the cut was all they had , i think there will be disappointment			0
' the euro rose to $ 1.3191 and @entity23 10 - year government bond futures edged higher after the decision			0
the sharp drop in inflation , from 1.7 per cent in march , pressured the @entity0 to cut rates to honour its mandate to deliver price stability , which it defines as inflation close to but below 2 per cent			1
the sudden slump in price pressures has also raised the possibility of the @entity0 having to look at policy tools beyond interest rates to counter any further slide in inflation			1
' ultimately , we think the @entity0 will have to purchase private - sector assets in order to fix the transmission mechanism , ' said @entity133 at @entity134 , the world 's largest bond fund			1
the @entity0 wants to improve the transmission of its monetary policy so its low rates reach all corners of the eurozone			1
the bloc 's south is not benefiting to the same extent as the north from the ultra-low rates			0
if they are lending at all , banks there are charging companies and households more for loans than their peers in the north because of higher funding costs and credit risks			0
resistance : @entity23 chancellor @entity157 said last week the @entity0 would have to raise rates if it were looking at @entity23 alone the @entity0 has repeatedly voiced its concern about the impact this has on lending to small - and medium - sized enterprises ( @entity106 ) , which have little alternative to bank funding and are a key engine for growth in the currency bloc			1
it has said it is studying options to address the problem , but little is expected to have been decided at thursday 's policy meeting			0
it is one of two that the @entity0 holds outside of @entity176 each year			2
' we suspect that the @entity0 will avoid making any formal statement on a potential @entity106 programme ... as it continues to weigh the pros and cons of such measures , ' said @entity183 , senior euro zone economist at @entity184			0
some @entity0 policymakers are reluctant to try to fix too many of the euro zone 's problems , eager to push onto governments the issue of dealing with @entity106 lending			2
@entity1 must balance this reluctance with the pressure for action			0
in @entity23 , the @entity0 has even faced resistance to a rate cut			0
@entity23 chancellor @entity157 said last week the @entity0 would have to raise rates if it were looking at @entity23 alone			2
@entity23 insurers and the county 's dominant savings and cooperative banking sector have also joined up to speak out against looser @entity0 monetary policy , saying it would have little economic impact and undermined savings needed to protect the country 's rapidly ageing population .			2

move comes after inflation drops to 1.2 % , well below @entity0 's target of 2 %
unemployment hit record high in april and there are fears economy will not recover from recession this year
experts say rates may not be passed on by banks in debt - ridden countries
