by @entity0 he has been voted the world ’s best player and is an icon for club and country			0
he is rewriting the record books and has won a treasure chest of trophies , including the biggest in club football			0
@entity10 has enjoyed a career that 95 per cent of players could only dream about but , for all that , it is lacking a game or goal to catapult him alongside the greatest there have been			1
think about those who occupy football ’s highest echelon , the names that span the ages : @entity22 and @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , on to @entity27 and @entity28			1
no 1 : @entity10 shows off his @entity30 award at the @entity31 back in january iconic moment : @entity22 is held aloft in the @entity33 after inspiring @entity34 to 1970 @entity36 glory one - man show : @entity24 is best remembered for winning the 1986 @entity36 with @entity38 the common bond is a defining moment			1
@entity23 won five @entity42 cups with @entity43 , scoring in every final			2
with @entity24 , it ’s the 1986 @entity36 in @entity46			0
for @entity26 , that volley against @entity48 to help win the 1988 @entity49			2
if scoring two goals to win the @entity36 for @entity51 in 1998 was n’t enough for @entity27 , four years later against @entity52 at @entity53 he conjured a volley from the gods — possibly the greatest goal in the @entity58 era — to give @entity43 their ninth @entity58			1
@entity28 sits easily alongside them			0
he , remember , has scored goals to clinch two @entity58 finals , strikes in @entity62 and at @entity63 that glossed all his other extraordinary achievements			0
i ’ve always felt the greatest need those distinguishing moments			0
do not take my argument as a criticism of @entity10			1
he is a player for whom i have the utmost admiration and i ca n’t wait to see him in action on sunday in @entity72 , the biggest game in football			1
@entity43 and @entity75 always have the best players in the business			0
all - time great : @entity43 's @entity23 scores in the 1960 @entity58 final volley good show : @entity26 hammers home his memorable goal in the @entity82 final best in the business : @entity27 's wonderstrike at @entity53 in 2002 confirmed his star class that tag sits easily with @entity10 , who is producing numbers not seen since the 1930s era of @entity89			1
he moved past @entity90 in midweek with a double against @entity92 , taking his tally to 242 goals in 236 games			0
of those , 171 have come in @entity97			0
his ratio and consistency are extraordinary			0
he is made for @entity72			1
if he initially found games against @entity75 difficult , he now thrives on them			0
and not even @entity28 has achieved what @entity10 has done in this fixture , scoring in six consecutive matches			1
that shows how many levels he has raised his game			0
when he came to @entity108 , he had skill and speed but i never worried about playing against him			0
he did n’t have a great record against @entity113 or @entity114 , only scoring two goals against us , and one of those was a penalty in a 4 - 1 defeat			2
what i would say , though , is that in his final two years with @entity122 , he got as close as anyone to matching the levels set by @entity125			2
winner : but @entity10 's performance in the 2008 @entity58 final was not up there with @entity27 's in 2002 strong and quick , two great feet and powerful in the air , he blossomed because his greatest strength is his work ethic			1
look at his physique — he has got that from extra work in the gym , striving to keep ahead of the game			0
how about those free - kicks ? @entity10 ’s technique for getting the ball to dip viciously has only come through practice			1
he will work twice as hard as some players with half his ability			0
you could see how much winning the @entity30 ( above ) for a second time meant to him , when he was overcome with emotion			2
but , privately , i suspect he will feel a defining moment now could make him one of the best of all time , not just one of the best of his generation			1
so , how does he do that ? i do n’t believe @entity155 will win the @entity36 but he has the potential to be top scorer in @entity34			2
you only have to consider his hat - trick against @entity159 in the play - offs last november to appreciate the added dimension he gives to his national side			2
magic moment : @entity28 celebrates scoring in the @entity165 final at @entity63 that leaves the @entity58			1
people will say @entity10 has scored in a @entity58 final but neither his goal nor performance in @entity171 defined that game in the manner of @entity174 and @entity175 respectively when @entity114 ( 2005 ) and @entity113 ( 2012 ) won it			1
@entity43 will be confident of reaching the semi-finals now after being drawn against @entity177 , and if @entity10 could lead them to the final in @entity179 , he would have the perfect stage to deliver the performance of a lifetime			1
his first couple of seasons at the @entity185 were complicated because @entity43 were competing with the greatest @entity75 team of all time but , even still , his trophy haul of one @entity97 title and a solitary @entity190 does not do justice to his talents			2
it is looking like he will win @entity97 again this season but is that enough for @entity43 , given their history in @entity42 ? is it enough for @entity10 ? if he was never to win the @entity58 with @entity43 , how would their supporters view him ? on the brink of greatness : could the @entity58 final be @entity10 's stage ? that ’s why i feel he needs something else to set him apart and that ’s why a triumphant display in @entity179 on may 24 could be his destiny			1
should he get the goal to give @entity43 their 10th triumph in the finest competition of all , he would finally have the legacy his work and desire so richly deserve			0
@entity215 faces big dilemma over £ 37m @entity217 @entity122 got a great lift when they beat @entity219 on wednesday with the kind of pacy , energetic performance you expect of them			1
the displays of @entity225 and @entity226 in that 3 - 0 win , however , mean @entity215 faces a couple of big decisions , because their input came from positions @entity215 has tried to strengthen by spending £ 27.5million on @entity232 and £ 37m on @entity217			1
you could see the impact @entity225 and @entity226 had on @entity234 and @entity235			0
@entity122 suddenly had pace and penetration in their movement , while @entity225 ’s brilliant range of passing gave them space to run into and opportunities in front of goal			0
masterclass : @entity225 was outstanding in the heart of @entity122 's midfield on wednesday night oh , @entity248 : @entity226 put in an impressive shift for @entity122 in @entity217 's absence so it will be interesting to see how @entity215 deploys his two major signings going forward and how he shapes his team , as you can not imagine he has spent £ 65m for them to be bit - part performers			1
neither @entity232 nor @entity217 are quick and on a pitch as big as the one at @entity258 , a lack of pace is always highlighted			1
@entity217 reminds me of @entity262			1
he was brilliant for @entity263 and he looked every inch a @entity122 player before he signed			0
but @entity266 has a smaller pitch than @entity258 and @entity262 did n’t have the speed to get around it			0
similarly , @entity217 stood out at @entity269 , which is also tight			1
there is no doubt he has talent but does @entity217 have the legs for @entity258 ’s wide open spaces ? back in action : @entity217 is expected to return for @entity122 against @entity276 on saturday my top five ... escape artists this has been a season when the clubs frantically fighting relegation have changed managers in the middle of the campaign to try to save themselves			1
will @entity288 ’s @entity287 , @entity289 of @entity290 or @entity293 ’s @entity292 import @entity291 be as successful as this quintet ? 1 @entity295 ( @entity296 1994 - 95 ) : @entity295 was already a club legend before he pulled @entity296 back from the brink			2
they were bottom when he took over from @entity299 in november 1994 but finished five points above the relegation zone and won the @entity302 for good measure			2
@entity304 : @entity295 ( second left ) celebrates @entity296 's 1995 @entity302 triumph 2 @entity306 ( @entity276 2006 - 07 ) : when he arrived six months after @entity276 had taken @entity114 to the wire in the @entity302 final , @entity306 ( right ) looked to have jumped on to a sinking ship			1
seven wins from the last nine matches , including a 1 - 0 win at @entity258 , saw him beat the odds			2
3 @entity314 ( @entity290 2007 - 08 ) : it was n’t as bleak for @entity314 as the situation now facing @entity289 , but @entity290 had won just twice and were 18th in the table when he was appointed in december 2007			0
twelve points from their final five fixtures saw them stay up			0
4 @entity320 ( @entity321 2005 - 06 ) : it was a controversial call to bring @entity320 back after he had spent some of the last season at @entity325 — but it worked a treat			0
@entity321 finished four points clear of the drop zone			0
5 @entity329 ( @entity330 1982 - 83 ) : @entity329 has to make the line - up because i vividly remember him running across @entity333 , wearing brown shoes and dancing a jig , after he had saved @entity330 and condemned opponents @entity337 to the drop			0
last - gasp : @entity329 ( centre ) tries to keep the peace after he ran on the pitch following @entity330 's win at @entity337 in 1983			2

@entity10 is in the form of his life heading into sunday 's @entity72
but he needs a defining moment - such as @entity27 's volley in the @entity348 final - to be classed among the all - time greats
