by @entity0 he is now so much a part of the nation 's social fabric that it 's hard to comprehend a time when @entity6 was more reviled than revered			1
barely past the opening credits of a new documentary about @entity6 , though , we get a glimpse of how many @entity11 felt about him during a tumultuous time in the country 's history			1
' i find nothing amusing or interesting or tolerable about this man , ' television host @entity19 said , nearly spitting his words out in a 1968 broadcast as @entity6 looked on			1
' he 's a disgrace to his country , his race , and what he laughably describes as his profession			2
from draft - dodging pariah to hero , @entity6 's long and sometimes painful journey was finally complete			1
for those who did n't live in the time and are only faintly aware of the tale , it is a remarkable one			2
for those who grew up in the era and know well @entity6 's impact on a country just beginning to come to terms with race relations , it 's a refresher course , complete with clips of @entity6 at his bombastic - and to some , scary - best			1
' i do n't have to be what you want me to be , ' @entity6 is shown telling reporters the morning after his first fight with @entity68 in 1964 , when he announced to the world he was a follower of the @entity70			1
boxing fans were already wary of his involvement with the @entity74 movement , but he became a pariah to even more when he refused induction to the @entity77 at the height of the @entity79 as a conscientious objector , famously saying , ' i ai n't got no quarrel with the @entity82			1
' disgrace : ' i find nothing amusing or interesting or tolerable about this man , ' television host @entity19 said , nearly spitting his words out in a 1968 broadcast as @entity6 , pictured left 10 years later , looked on banned from boxing and facing five years in prison , he spent three prime fighting years on the sideline while the courts debated what to do with him			1
once the heavyweight champion of the world , he became a speaker on college campuses to make a living and keep his cause before the public			2
' you 're talking about a man being hit with the war situation and taking a stand along with his involvement with the @entity70			0
it was new turf , ' said @entity108 , his wife at the time , who is interviewed in the film			0
' he was comfortable making his decisions , but the thing that was hard to bear was whether he would fight again			0
it did n't look like a hopeful battle			0
' transformation : ' the trials of @entity6 ' - now playing in selected theaters - then shows president @entity44 giving @entity6 , pictured in 1974 , the @entity45 in 2005 @entity6 would eventually win the battle , and go on to not only regain the heavyweight title but become the most famous athlete of his time			1
the @entity11 @entity122 finally took up his case and reversed his conviction on a technicality in 1971 in a decision that surprised some considering the tenor of the times			0
the decision itself is also the subject of a drama that airs saturday night on @entity133			0
' @entity134 ' uses actors including @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 to play @entity122 justices , but @entity6 himself is taken from the clips of the era at his oratorical best			1
' why tell his story when he tells it himself ? ' said @entity144 , the movie 's writer			0
but tell a story the @entity133 movie does , though some liberties are taken for entertainment 's sake			0
among them are the justices being shown at one point gathering in the basement of the @entity122 building to watch sex movies for a case before them on pornography , and a clerk smoking marijuana in a court bathroom			0
it 's surprisingly engrossing , though , for a movie that revolves almost entirely around the legal process			0
at the center of it is a clerk for justice @entity168 , who convinces him to switch his vote so that @entity6 's conviction would be overturned on a technicality and he would not have to go to prison			1
the movie and the documentary are n't related except that they both feature @entity6			1
they do , however , share funny clips from when @entity6 - complete with big afro and beard - is shown singing in the 1969 @entity181 musical ' @entity177			2
' anger : @entity6 , pictured in 2006 , angered the nation when he refused induction to the @entity77 at the height of the @entity79 as a conscientious objector , famously saying , ' i ai n't got no quarrel with the @entity82 ' a man had to make a living , but @entity6 's days as an actor were numbered when the play closed after seven performances			1
@entity194 , who was married to @entity6 from 1967 - 77 , said she never gave up hope during her husband 's dark period that he would be allowed to fight again , though @entity6 himself had his doubts			2
' my frame of mind was more positive than his was and it helped keep him afloat , ' she said			0
' the best thing for @entity6 at the time was to keep him focused on his family life			2
that 's all we had to work with			0
' @entity194 has n't seen her former husband - now married to his fourth wife , @entity211 - since they both attended @entity214 's funeral in 2011			0
but she still feels protective of @entity6 , with whom she had four children , and believes the documentary is a way of educating people to the times they lived in and what they went through			1
' i 'm tired of people giving the wrong information , ' she said			2
' you 're talking about one of the most famous people in recent history			0
the facts should be correct			0

barely past the opening credits of a new documentary about @entity6 , we get a glimpse of how he was once more reviled than revered
