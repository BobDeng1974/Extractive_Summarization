by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:36 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 02:04 est , 9 may 2013 public health reforms which would have pushed up the price of alcohol and forced cigarettes to be sold in plain packets were missing from the @entity8			1
health campaigners expressed dismay at the omissions , with @entity13 mps with some @entity13 mps warning @entity15 not to try to outflank the @entity17 @entity16 as the party of ' beer & fags '			1
but the ideas were shelved to focus on the economy and tackling immigration , to avoid being seen to add to the cost of living for hard - pressed families			0
they promised measures to boost ‘ fire up ’ the private sector , increase pensions and protect consumers			0
but today 's @entity8 did not contain expected legislation on tracking internet use , a register of lobbyists and enshrining in law a promise to spend 0.7 per cent of gdp on foreign aid			0
however , the government came in for fierce criticism for the lack of any public health policies in today 's statement			2
the government has quietly dropped a string of ideas it planned to include in this year 's @entity8			2
government sources insist ministers want to focus on issues which matter to voters , and not adding to living costs or red - tape			0
among the coalition 's ideas not included were : mr @entity15 championed the idea of a minimum unit price for alcohol , arguing it would curb problem drinking			2
but it was opposed by the @entity79 ’s @entity78 , home secretary @entity80 , education secretary @entity81 and former health secretary @entity82			1
just weeks ago it was reported that the government would also press ahead with laws forcing tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plan packets , copying rules introduced in @entity90 last year			1
the @entity91 - an alliance of more than 100 health charities , unions , royal colleges and campaign groups - today wrote to the prime minister and the health secretary to implore them to introduce the measure			1
health secretary @entity100 insisted the ideas had not been dropped altogether			1
‘ we have n’t made a decision , ’ he told @entity102 said plans in @entity104 for minimum alcohol pricing had been challenged in the courts , while @entity90 ’s cigarette laws only came into force in january			1
mr @entity100 added : ‘ it ’s a much harder job to assess the evidence as to how effective it will be and that takes time			2
and i want to make sure we do the job properly so i ’m going to take the time that i need to			0
’ there was speculation that the move was a reaction to the rise of @entity16 , whose leader @entity121 has promised to scrap the smoking ban in pubs			2
during the local election campaign , he was regularly pictured smoking with a pint in his hand			0
but @entity13 mp @entity128 , a former gp , has repeatedly called for action to tackle problem drinking			1
she tweeted : ' we should n't compete with @entity121 by looking like a party which promotes beer & fags			1
' she also raised questions about the role played by @entity138 , who has been hired as chief @entity13 election strategist			1
his pr and lobbying firm @entity140 was on a retainer for @entity144 when the industry was trying to block plain packet laws in @entity90			2
@entity13 @entity147 warned the government against trying to outflank @entity121 's @entity16 as the party of ' booze and fags ' former gp turned @entity13 mp @entity128 warned against trying to outflank @entity16 on public health dr @entity128 added : ' did mr @entity138 have any involvement in advising on dropping these public health measures ? ' whatever your views on minimum pricing we deserve clarity about advice from lobbyists at the heart of @entity163 & a @entity164 to challenge			1
' a plan to create a register of firms which lobby the government to have policy changes has also been dropped			0
shadow health secretary @entity170 said : ' two key public health policies have been dropped since @entity138 arrived in @entity172			1
' @entity15 needs to come clean about whether @entity138 had any involvement in these decisions			2
' from the outside it looks very much like a right - wing lobbyist is dictating the coalition 's public health policy			2
' labour leader @entity180 also raised questions in the @entity37 about why the government ' dropped the @entity183 ' after mr @entity138 's arrival			1
however , a @entity172 source denied mr @entity138 had any influence over policy			2
' mr @entity138 has not lobbies the prime minister on anything			0
there has not been any impact on the @entity8 whatsoever			0
' mr @entity138 does not had a desk in @entity194 or a pass to enter @entity172 , the source added			0
health secretary @entity100 is under pressure over the decision not to legislate on plain cigarette packets , while questions have been raised about the role @entity13 election strategist , who has worked as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry dr @entity205 , chairman of council at the @entity207 , said he was ' bitterly disappointed ' that the measures were omitted from the @entity8			1
dr @entity205 added : ' if the @entity211 on its pledge to deal with alcohol and tobacco related harm , we will have to question its commitment to protecting the nation 's health , ' he said			0
' a minimum unit price for alcohol would result in a decrease in thousands of alcohol related deaths			0
' ultimately taxpayers pay the price as the @entity224 picks up the bill for the damage to health and lives lost from tobacco and alcohol related causes			0
' health groups also urged the government to act to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes			1
dr @entity234 , @entity237 's chief executive , added : ' there is strong evidence that removing glitzy designs from cigarette packs makes them less attractive to children , increases the impact of on - pack health warnings and stops tobacco companies misleading consumers about the harm cigarettes cause			0
' if the government is serious about improving the nation 's health and stopping so many people dying early - which it says it is - it must reconsider its decision and push for the early adoption of standardised packaging			0
' legislation : cigarettes would have been sold in plain packaging under the plan which has been shelved laws passed in @entity90 mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking @entity269 , chief executive of health charity action on @entity271 ( @entity272 ) , said : ' if the government can not find the courage to act , then @entity273 must be given the chance to decide , as it did with smokefree legislation			1
' but @entity278 , managing director of @entity279 @entity17 , said : ' the decision of the @entity274 not to include plain packaging in the @entity28 's speech reflects that the regulatory principles of evidence based policy not policy based evidence are being observed			0
' the tobacco control lobbyists have attempted to convince mps that plain packaging will discourage young people from taking up smoking ; they have tried to use emotion to circumvent the government 's own consultation process and to close down any debate			0
