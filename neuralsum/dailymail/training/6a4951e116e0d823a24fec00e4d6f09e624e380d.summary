other reports suggested she was setting up an observation post when she was shot			2
her family , including her 18 - year - old daughter @entity62 , who all live in @entity63 , @entity64 , are baffled as to how an apparently harmless woman could have ended up in such a situation			1

however his wife soon grew unhappy and rebelled at how she was treated			0
in 2007 they split up and later divorced			0
the friend said : ‘ he carried on as if they were still in @entity10			1
he is very religious and did n’t allow her to get cable or to play music			0

daughter : @entity154 , right , took to @entity155 on friday to blame the @entity4 government for her mother 's death while denying her accused ties to terrorism but for @entity36 at least it seems that there was definitely a commitment of some kind , regardless of her motives			1

‘ then she would go back home and carry on her life			0
she paid for everything and just wanted to be there for him			0
‘ she would be a housewife for him , basically ’			0
it is not clear if @entity36 was already a muslim before she met @entity9 or if he persuaded her to convert , although in @entity15 converting a non-believer is seen as extremely praiseworthy			1
regardless of which , it is likely that he brought her round to his militant viewpoint during their time together			0
