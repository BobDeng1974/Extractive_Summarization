@entity1 mp @entity0 said @entity3 mps should be given more power over @entity3 matters @entity6 is facing growing calls to ban @entity9 mps from voting on laws which only affect @entity3 if the country votes to reject independence on thursday			1
former cabinet minister @entity14 said the @entity15 should sit as an ‘ @entity16 ’ for most of the week and only let @entity9 mps attend when discussing ‘ union ’ issues like foreign policy and defence			1
outspoken backbencher @entity0 went further , saying : ' why are we paying them to eat deep - fried mars bars when we ca n't even get decent health care in this country ? ' conservative mps are concerned that in the wake of a ‘ no ’ vote on thursday , the @entity28 will be given sweeping new powers over tax and welfare but mps from north of the border will still be able to vote on matters which only apply in @entity3			1
mr @entity14 said @entity37 should pledge not to vote on @entity3 matters after the independence referendum			2
mr @entity14 said : ‘ as a @entity9 parliament is going to have the power to fix income tax in @entity9 we need an @entity3 parliament to fix the level of income tax in @entity3			1
‘ i want @entity3 to get the same devolution as @entity9 and i want @entity3 to get the government it votes for			1
‘ in 2010 we voted for a @entity1 government in @entity3 and @entity9 mps gave us a coalition			1
you have to form the @entity3 parliament from the @entity3 mps			2
‘ i want them to meet as an @entity3 parliament and have our own @entity3 ministers on @entity3 issues just as the @entity9 parliament meets , but believing in economy i believe i can do both jobs with my colleagues as we do at the moment			2
’ mr @entity14 said some policy areas , such as foreign affairs , would still be under the remit of a @entity62 parliament			0
‘ i am asking for justice and balance			0
i wish @entity9 every success with her vote			2
if she votes to stay in , as i hope she does , she will get more devolved powers , that ’s fine by me			0
‘ i just ask that @entity3 gets exactly the same and we are not going to be fobbed off with breaking up and balkanising our country			0
‘ we want an @entity3 parliament to settle @entity3 income tax to match the @entity9 parliament settling @entity9 income tax			1
she said additional powers for @entity3 mps needed to be considered as part of a ‘ coherent approach ’ alongside more devolution for @entity9 and @entity92			1
she said : ' we ’re [ @entity9 mps ] not going to have our extra powers immediately so i think it has to be part of that broader discussion			1
’ she questioned the plan set out by mr @entity14			0
dame @entity79 said : ‘ i think the trouble with @entity14 ’s proposal is he anticipates turning what i think of as the @entity102 @entity16 into an @entity16			0
‘ i think that ’s important , that there has to be a @entity102 @entity16 in order to do all the things that you just mentioned – the foreign affairs , defence and things like that			0
‘ i think that from @entity14 ’s point of view and indeed the people who feel that there ’s a democratic deficit with regard to @entity3 should actually look at the way that we ’ve done it in @entity9 , which is through constitutional conventions and building a broader consensus			2
‘ i have to say , we ’re four days away from knowing the result of the referendum			0
i think the timing of this is not the best			0
‘ i would much rather we were putting our energies into making sure @entity9 did remain part of the @entity62 because the decision will be different on friday , depending on what the outcome of the referendum is			0

the *pm* is facing calls to ban @entity9 mps from voting on ' @entity3 ' laws
comes after @entity140 parties agreed to hand @entity141 new powers
in event of a ' no ' vote , @entity144 will get *control* over tax and welfare
@entity9 's *59* mps will still be allowed to vote on laws only affecting @entity3
@entity1 mps want a new ' @entity16 ' in the @entity15
