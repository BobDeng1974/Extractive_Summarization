another report that @entity38 made a few days later in @entity20 is considered missing			0
this has fueled speculation that the @entity5 government helped cover up @entity11 responsibility for the massacre out of fear that saying the truth would anger @entity10 , whom the @entity53 were counting on to help them defeat @entity44 and @entity55 in @entity23 for decades , @entity56 had blamed the @entity6 for the massacre , but then in 1990 admitted that @entity10 had ordered it			1
