by @entity0 published : 20:02 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 05:04 est , 1 june 2013 split : @entity2 confirmed he has split from wife @entity3			1
the couple have an 11 - year - old son by rights , this should be a time of celebration for @entity2			2
after all , it is not every week your new tv show airs on one of @entity14 ’s biggest networks			2
and the @entity16 - born celebrity baker has long harboured hopes of carving out the @entity14 fame to match his showbiz surname			1
yet , instead of toasting his success , @entity20 cut a tortured figure this week as he sat slumped behind the wheel of his flashy @entity25 sports car in a @entity27 village , his head in his hands			2
as he arrived back at his 13th - century marital home for ‘ crisis ’ talks with his estranged wife @entity3 , he bore the haunted look of someone who has come , belatedly , to the realisation he faces losing everything he ’s strived for			1
gone is the carefree demeanour he displayed when appearing alongside @entity40 , the beautiful chef he is said to have become close to on the @entity14 version of @entity42 , which debuted on @entity43 on wednesday night			1
the show ’s producers had been doing much to trumpet the pair ’s supposed on - screen sexual chemistry , with promos showing the doll - like miss @entity49 , 34 , licking her lips and gazing at her @entity53 co-star , 47			1
yet reviews of the first episode have criticised the pair for lacking any spark			1
this must be mildly cheering for @entity59 , 49 , the mother of @entity20 ’s son @entity61 , 11 , whom the chef walked out on last month amid rumours about his friendship with @entity14 - born @entity40			1
@entity3 has taken off her wedding ring and is said to be demanding a divorce from @entity20 , who has moved into a flat close to the home they shared in @entity71 , @entity27			0
which might explain why @entity20 looks so worried			0
he has good reason to be concerned			0
despite the belated public backing of his @entity78 bosses this week , his long - term future on @entity42 remains in jeopardy following a backlash from his once - smitten female fans			0
at the same time , he may face being financially crippled if his wife follows through with her threat of ending the marriage			1
for @entity20 ’s part , sources on his @entity87 show say he is desperate for a reconciliation with his wife — and has turned to co-star @entity90 for help winning her back			1
new clues suggest the pair ’s marriage was stable until recently			2
a month before the split , the bread - maker turned showbiz personality set up a new business to funnel his growing television and media earnings			2
rumours : @entity0 is apparently dating his @entity105 co-host @entity40 leading ladies : @entity2 has become a household name presenting with chef @entity90 ( right )			1
he recently filmed the @entity14 version of the show with @entity49 ( left ) significantly , he appointed @entity3 to the role of company secretary when launching @entity112 on march 7 this year			0
according to records at @entity116 , the husband and wife are the only shareholders in the firm , which has its registered office in a terrace of commercial properties in @entity122 , @entity123			2
@entity59 was already the secretary of his only other business , @entity126 , which was first registered as a company in july 2004			1
as well as his six - figure @entity78 salary and a similar fee for the @entity14 counterpart , his bestselling book @entity2 ’s @entity134 , released in march to coincide with a spin - off tv series , has pushed the baker ’s earnings close to £ 1.5million in the past year			2
accountants say that , even after a divorce , @entity59 would be under no obligation to resign her position , which , importantly , gives her a half share in the new company ’s profits			1
the fact @entity20 appointed her to the role so recently signposts how quickly the relationship broke down			2
the new firm was set up just a week before @entity20 flew off to @entity151 in the @entity14 to film for two months with former pastry chef miss @entity49 , a divorced mother - of - one			0
by the time he returned , his marriage was over			0
now @entity59 is said to be talking to lawyers , which could include walking away with her share of the couple ’s assets , which include their £ 800,000 , grade i - listed home			1
certainly , no one can deny that blonde @entity3 , whom @entity20 met when he was working as a baker at a hotel in @entity169 in the @entity170 , has been there alongside him every step of the way as he rose to fame			2
she helped him set up his successful bread - making business , based in @entity175 , @entity27 , which supplies @entity176 and @entity177			0
beloved : the @entity87 programme has cultivated a wholesome , traditional image that appeals to millions of viewers firm friends : @entity90 and @entity2 have been good friends since they met eight years ago he then landed his role in @entity42 , alongside judge @entity90 , in 2010			1
and it is to 78 - year - old mrs @entity90 he has turned , in the hope of salvaging his marriage — and reputation			1
friends say he is hoping @entity90 , with whom he started filming the fourth series of the @entity53 show in @entity191 this month , will act as a go - between in his bid to win @entity59 back			1
and @entity90 , who regularly puts up her co-judge at the @entity123 home she shares with her husband of 47 years , @entity196 , is believed to be keen to help , offering to telephone @entity59 to push @entity20 ’s case			1
the two couples , who have known each other since @entity200 and @entity20 appeared on a satellite food channel in 2005 , have been regular dinner companions and @entity3 describes @entity90 as ‘ wonderful ’ but mrs @entity20 will have been unimpressed when the grand dame of baking defended @entity20 to friends last week , saying : ‘ you ca n’t blame him , things happen and boys will be boys			1
’ what is undeniable is that @entity20 ’s problems might all be solved if his wife were to take him back			1
@entity20 , who revels in the soubriquet ‘ the @entity217 of baking ’ , has been stung by the backlash from one - time devotees on @entity221 and other social media			0
the @entity78 reacted to claims members of the production team want him dropped from the series for damaging its ‘ wholesome ’ image by announcing his job was safe @entity90 has hinted she would quit if he got the chop			1
but sources at the @entity232 say it would have been nigh on impossible to replace him for the current series because filming had started when news of his marriage split and alleged affair broke earlier this month			1
and executives who have been in touch with @entity42 ’s executive producer @entity243 have refused to give private assurances to @entity20 he will still have a job once this series has aired this summer			0
only recently , the chef , who worked as head baker at the @entity250 in @entity251 , had been talking about his hopes he would still be making the show in 15 years ’ time			1
traditional : @entity90 , 78 was expected to disapprove of @entity20 's antics , but she is said to be supporting him in this difficult time he is said by friends to refer to his role as judge and its lucrative spin - offs as the ‘ family silver ’			1
with miss @entity49 on the other side of the @entity267 , clearly @entity20 ’s thoughts have turned back to the devoted @entity59 , who until recently had talked lovingly on @entity221 of cooking him his favourite steak flambé with prunes , cream and @entity273			1
so far , she is said to have rebuffed his attempts at a reconciliation			0
i am told she took soundings from her closest girlfriends at a spa day to celebrate her birthday earlier this month			0
some friends are adamant she should refuse to take him back			2
meanwhile , members of the crew on the set of the @entity14 version told the @entity290 how miss @entity40 and @entity20 retired to a shared trailer between takes			1
while the show ’s host @entity292 had his motor home close to the set , theirs was , say production staff , partitioned into ‘ his and hers ’ quarters			0
@entity20 and miss @entity49 also stayed at the same @entity300 while on location			0
it is clear they got on like a house on fire judging by the photos of them posing together they posted on @entity221 and her description of him as a ‘ handsome devil ’			0
however , miss @entity49 has made it plain she has no intention of coming to @entity53 and has set her sights on becoming the most famous female chef in the @entity14 according to sources , she would also not want to take her nine - year - son @entity318 out of the school he attends near her home @entity320 , @entity321			0
she is divorced from the boy ’s father , after whom he is named , @entity324 politician @entity322			0
last year , the couple had a brief reconciliation , during which she described her ex as her ‘ latin - loving - rodeo - riding - sexy - as - hell - husband ’ however , she and @entity322 split again before she met @entity20			2
miss @entity49 , who trained as a chef in @entity331 and @entity332 , started her own catering company in @entity334 , @entity324 , and later created a brand of tequila			0
meanwhile , former colleagues in @entity169 are raising knowing eyebrows at talk of @entity20 ’s travails			0
by all accounts , he was known for having an ‘ eye for the ladies ’ during his time working at the five - star @entity345 and @entity346 hotels on the island			0
at the time , rumours flew around the expat community that he was being followed around by two besotted local girls even after meeting @entity27 - born @entity3 , who was working there as a scuba diving instructor			0
one @entity53 chef , who was a guest at the couple ’s wedding on @entity169 in 1998 , said : ‘ @entity0 was focused on his work			0
' he was a brilliant baker			2
he helped open three hotels and worked incredibly hard			0
i never once saw him on the beach			0
it ’s hard on your social life , but @entity0 was always popular			0
’ judging by his effect on miss @entity49 , not much has changed			0
the question is whether @entity20 can work his charms on his devastated wife — and rescue his shaky career .			2
