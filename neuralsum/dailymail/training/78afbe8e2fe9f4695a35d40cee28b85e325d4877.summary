by @entity0 published : 13:45 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 08:58 est , 22 june 2012 facing prison : handcuffed @entity2 leaving the court after being found guilty @entity2 faces up to 34 years in a @entity5 prison after she was last night found guilty of murdering her two children			1
the @entity8 mother stared blankly at the floor as the unanimous verdict rang out at @entity11 , in north - east @entity5			1
the 45 - year - old is now on suicide watch after previously trying to kill herself			0
after eight hours ’ deliberation , the jury foreman announced the panel of seven men and two women had believed @entity2 was ‘ fully conscious ’ and knew what she was doing when she smothered @entity21 , five , and 11 - month - old @entity22 in their beds in a @entity25 hotel			1
they flatly rejected @entity2 ’s defence claim that she was insane , pronouncing her guilty on both counts of murder			1
it means she faces spending the next three decades in a standard @entity5 prison cell , as the jury rejected an alternative verdict which would have allowed her to serve her sentence in a psychiatric wing			2
jurors agreed @entity2 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , did suffer from an unspecified psychosis and from depression – but ruled she was not criminally insane			1
they said she ‘ took advantage of the trust the children gave her as their mother ’ and their ‘ defencelessness ’ as sleeping children			2
judge @entity49 will sentence her at a later date			0
outside court , prosecutor @entity51 said : ‘ today justice has been done for two defenceless small children who were murdered in the most abominable and vile way – by their own mother			1
’ after the verdicts , the judge and lawyers in the case joined members of the jury in a local bar			0
she became obsessed with the idea that @entity8 social services would put the youngsters in care – which she considered a fate ‘ worse than death ’			0
she asked her daughter if she would prefer to spend a few brilliant days with her mother or a horrible lifetime without her			2
when @entity21 said she wanted to stay with her mother , @entity2 took the children to the resort of @entity93 to give them ‘ a perfect holiday ’			1
they checked into room 101 of the @entity97 on may 15 , 2010			0
after two days of playing together and posing for seaside snaps , she put them to bed at about 7pm and waited an hour until they were asleep			0
then she took a plastic shopping bag and suffocated them			0
the next day – having tried to commit suicide – she instructed reception to summon @entity5 police			0
during her trial @entity2 refused to answer more than 100 questions from prosecutor @entity51			1
the jury were shown a chilling video of @entity2 calmly confessing to detectives as she sat on a bed in the next - door hotel room			1
' conscious ' : the 45 - year - old looked on edge today as she waited to hear if the jury would accept her defence of mental illness @entity76 , who was found dead in his cell in january she told officers : ‘ i have ended the lives of my two children			1
' i gave the children a three - day holiday , a perfect holiday			2
i knew they were going to take my children to @entity127			2
‘ my intention was that my children and me together would go			2
it was n’t just the children			2
’ the court heard @entity2 was ‘ pathologically obsessed ’ with her partner @entity76 – they shared their surname but she was not his wife			1
as she was led away to the cells last night , @entity8 social services faced questions about their role in the tragedy			0
both @entity141 and @entity38 social services knew @entity21 was potentially at risk when @entity76 was arrested on november 1 , 2007 , on suspicion of raping his step - daughter @entity144 , @entity2 ’s elder daughter from a previous relationship			1
yet they allowed the family to flee to @entity5 before @entity21 could be taken to safety			0
last night a blame game erupted as @entity141 social services said they had passed the file to @entity38 , who said they were relying on the police to chase the family in @entity5			0
@entity76 was previously thought to be the father of @entity22 and @entity21 , whom his partner has admitted killing in a @entity5 hotel room @entity2 admits suffocating @entity21 and @entity22 but claims to have been in an unsound mental state at the time of the killings @entity2 in court in yesterday , where she insisted the dna test results showing her partner was not the father of her two children must have been incorrect meanwhile the @entity5 equivalent of social services claimed : ‘ nobody put us on alert and so nobody took any measures to protect the children			1
’ even after @entity76 was deported to the @entity8 , @entity38 social services did not ask its counterpart to retrieve @entity21 , and two weeks later she was dead			0
a @entity38 council spokesman said : ‘ during the short time the family were resident in @entity38 , the council did everything possible to initiate safeguarding procedures , and have assisted police fully in their continued investigations into this case			0
’ @entity2 is led into court yesterday after her lawyer called for her to be acquitted on mental health grounds @entity2 , pictured with her son @entity22 , was placed on suicide watch after learning of her partner 's hanging in prison the riddle over the dead children ’s paternity took a twist yesterday when it was suggested their mother had once worked as a prostitute			1
@entity2 used to offer ‘ personal services ’ to clients across the @entity204 , police sources said			1
her trial in @entity5 heard the bombshell dna revelation that the children she suffocated were not fathered by her partner , paedophile @entity76			1
he killed himself in january in prison			0
the mystery over their true parentage was made deeper by the fact @entity21 was born in @entity215 in 2004 , and @entity22 was born in @entity79 in 2009			0
a senior police source in @entity8 said : ‘ in the 1990s , the family had very little money and at one stage were even forced to live for some time in a static caravan			0
‘ during this time @entity2 was offering “ holistic ” or “ personal ” services to a wide range of clients in the @entity204 , and @entity76 would drive her to one of these sessions and wait in the car while she conducted the business			2
‘ it is generally understood by those investigating the case that @entity232 was offering sexual services to those clients – that she was in fact a prostitute			0

@entity2 looked impassive as unanimous verdict was read out
she admitted smothering son and daughter at @entity25 resort
her defence lawyer called for acquittal on grounds of mental illness
psychiatrist claimed @entity2 was in a psychotic state and acted ' out of love '
@entity252 said she had been ' fully conscious ' her actions were wrong
her paedophile partner is not the children 's father , court heard yesterday
