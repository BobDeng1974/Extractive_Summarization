@entity0 faced criticism tonight after demanding to be allowed to join other party leaders at the @entity4 ceremony at the @entity5 this weekend			1
the @entity7 leader claimed millions of @entity7 voters had been snubbed while leaders of smaller parties were allowed to attend			1
but a senior government source told @entity12 mr @entity0 was wrong to make the sombre wreath laying ceremony ' all about him '			2
@entity7 leader @entity0 hit out at the ' closed shop ' of @entity17 politics which meant @entity7 would not be represented at the @entity5 ceremony @entity19 will lead other politicians including @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 in laying wreaths after the @entity25 during sunday 's service			1
the @entity27 today insisted said the long - standing position was to invite a representative from parties with six or more mps			1
@entity7 only has a single member in the @entity33 , @entity34 mp @entity32			2
however it won the @entity37 elections in may , and @entity7 is targetting 100 seats in next year 's general election			1
mr @entity0 complained that the ' closed shop ' of the @entity17 political system prevented him from attending the event			2
he said : ' i think it 's actually quite a snub to all the millions of people that have voted @entity7			1
' prime minister @entity19 will lead other politicians in laying wreaths after the @entity25 during the @entity4 ceremony speaking on his @entity52 phone - in , mr @entity0 said : ' we 're not invited and i could say to you that personally i would like to be because this is a subject that i care very deeply about			1
' but what i think is , the whole point about political representation at the @entity5 is it 's not the politician that matters , it 's the voters behind the politician that matter			0
' and in the last national election @entity7 got 4.4 million votes and none of those people are being represented on sunday despite the fact there are political parties with far smaller votes than that being represented			1
' he added : ' whether it 's me or somebody else does n't really matter			0
but i do think that we won the last election we should have had some representation on sunday			0
and i think it 's actually quite a snub to all the millions of people that have voted @entity7			1
' mr @entity0 said it was for the government to invite him ' but i 'm afraid with this as with everything else , @entity17 politics operates like a closed shop and they do n't ' want anyone new to get involved '			0
' well they 're in for a terrible shock and i 'll tell you something , @entity7 will be there next year			1
' but a senior government source said : ' how dare @entity0 make the day of remembrance and the laying of wreaths all about him ? it tells you all you need to know about him			0
' the @entity7 leader also expressed surprise that @entity105 had halted auctions for the @entity108 poppies - and admitted he wanted to use the website to buy one himself			2
mr @entity0 also called for the @entity108 poppies to be allowed to stay for longer to give more people chance to see them all the 888,246 ceramic flowers used in the @entity114 installation have sold for Â£ 25 each through @entity115 , which runs the @entity108 , with the proceeds going to service charities			0
the internet auction site has cancelled any listings for the items following reports that one user had listed two of the poppies for sale , one at @entity126 and the other for @entity128			0
an @entity105 spokesman said : ' we are not permitting resale of the limited edition @entity134 poppies on @entity105			0
' but mr @entity0 said : ' i was very surprised to hear that @entity105 had done that , because whatever you think , you may say it 's insensitive , but hang on - when people bought these poppies there was no commercial contract that said they could n't sell them on			2
' so i 'm rather surprised by this			0
i have a slight confession , i did n't get in in time to buy any , nearly everyone i work with has got some , but i said to the children ' do n't worry , we 'll buy them on @entity105 in a few weeks time '			0
