' a pedestrian does not have to look at their feet when going about their business			2
' mr @entity8 has now been forced to pay the cash from his own pocket because his insurance company will not cover his legal bills			1
in a statement after the hearing , the couple 's solicitor @entity95 said : ' it ’s a sad day for @entity100 and @entity101			2

i feel very sorry for them			0
