by @entity0 published : 08:44 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 09:37 est , 16 may 2012 @entity2 law enforcement and homeland security personnel face an average of 55 daily encounters with ' known or suspected terrorists ' named on government watchlists , @entity2 officials told @entity9			1
the figure - which equals more than 20,000 contacts per year - underscores the growing sweep of the watchlists , which have expanded significantly since a failed christmas day 2009 bombing attempt of a @entity2 airliner			1
but officials note that very few of those daily contacts lead to arrests			1
civil liberties groups question the use of watchlists , and they have been ridiculed for ensnaring innocent citizens			2
at its headquarters , the @entity38 operates a 24 - hour command center , resembling something from a @entity43 thriller , complete with giant wall - screen projections and signs flashing ' secret			0
' officials said that when a law enforcement or homeland security officer in the field stops a person whose name matches a name in the @entity38 's databases , the officer is supposed to phone the @entity38 command center for instructions			0
based on information in the databases , the @entity38 then will advise the officer in the field how to proceed , which could range from releasing the suspect to calling in federal officers as backup			2
checkpoint : the @entity33 gets about 100 and 150 calls a day , of which an average of 55 involve individuals who turn out to be listed on a federal watchlists the command center gets between 100 and 150 inquiries a day , of which an average of 55 involve individuals who turn out to be listed on one of the federal watchlists , officials said			1
of those calls , about 60 per cent come from federal officers at border or airport security posts ; the rest come from local police			1
' there are incidents every single day , ' said @entity38 director @entity86			0
see something , say something ? civil liberties groups question the use of watchlists , and they have been ridiculed for ensnaring innocent citizens the watchlists include the best known ' no fly list ' as well as a ' selectee list ' of people who the government thinks should get extra screening or questioning before being allowed to board an @entity100 acknowledge that the number of names on these lists - and particularly the no - fly list - have grown considerably since christmas day 2009			1
underwear bomber : @entity106 was listed in a database called @entity108 , but not the no - fly list during his failed bomb plot that was when @entity112 - born militant @entity106 , who was listed in a classified database called @entity108 , but not the no - fly list , successfully boarded a @entity2 - bound aircraft but then failed to detonate a bomb which @entity118 militants had helped him stash in his underpants			1
before that incident , the number of names on the no - fly list was around 4,000			1
@entity2 officials said it now contains about 20,000 names while the selectee list contains another 18,000			2
a new threat to aviation security surfaced earlier this month , in the form of a foiled plot by @entity133 's @entity118 affiliate to deploy a more sophisticated ' underwear ' bomb			0
the watchlists have been the subject of controversy - most recently last week when an 18 - month - old girl and her parents were taken off a @entity142 flight when the toddler 's name appeared on a no - fly security list , apparently the result of a computer glitch			2
while the @entity2 government has instituted measures to enable people to petition for their names to be deleted , officials insist that over time the lists have become more accurate			0
watchlisting officials say that airlines maintain their own lists of potentially troublesome passengers ; often , they said , when a well - publicized case arises of a prominent or innocent person being denied boarding , it is because the air carrier , rather than the government , misconstrued the identity of someone on its proprietary lists			0
but @entity166 , a lawyer for the @entity167 , said her organization is pursuing legal action on behalf of people who have unjustifiably been restricted from flying			0
she said redress mechanisms maintained by the government are at best ' ineffective			0
' checks and balances : @entity173 officials say that airlines also maintain their own lists of potentially troublesome passengers two or three of the inquiries per day turn out to be people listed on the ' no fly ' list , the most restrictive of the watchlists maintained by the @entity38			2
a suspect 's name is put on the ' no fly ' list if they are deemed by government experts to be a threat to aviation , to be planning an attack or if they are ' operationally capable ' and are known to be planning to attend , or to have already attended , a militant training camp			0
fewer than 500 of the individuals on the no - fly list are @entity2 citizens , officials said			1
