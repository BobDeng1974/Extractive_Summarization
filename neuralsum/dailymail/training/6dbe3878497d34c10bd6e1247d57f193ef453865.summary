by @entity0 published : 12:54 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 16:43 est , 31 august 2012 prefers everyday life : while she loved winning @entity4 silver , @entity2 prefers the simple pleasures including a trip to @entity7 to the glamour of life in the @entity10 she may be the @entity11 ’s grand - daughter and one of our @entity4 medallists to boot , but @entity2 craves a low - key domesticity which could n’t be further from life in the @entity10			1
instead of pomp and glamour , it is the simple pleasures of buying new shoes , a trip to @entity7 or a rainy afternoon spent watching a dvd that she dreams of , she revealed today			0
but for the time being at least , what to many of us is a day - to - day reality remains a distant dream for the 31 - year - old			1
fresh from winning silver as part of our eventing team , she remains so busy with her equestrian career that even a year after her wedding to rugby player @entity40 , they still have not had time to book a honeymoon			1
she told how she was ‘ still living the @entity4 dream ’ and revelling in being part of the record - breaking @entity46 squad , but also looking forward to a return to normality			1
competing often means getting back to the yard in the middle of the night , faced with an hour ’s work unloading the horses and their kit with another early start to look forward to in the morning			2
‘ people assume i always look like i do in my riding kit or in a dress at a social event , but the day - to - day me is driving around in my filthy car with my dogs in the boot , wearing a pair of jeans and a hoody , ’ she said			1
‘ on the rare occasion that we do get a weekend off , we enjoy spending it together at our home in @entity69 , with the dogs of course			0
‘ i ’ll make a quick detour past @entity7 on the way back from the yard and @entity40 and i will cook something easy for supper - probably @entity76			1
’ once the eventing season comes to an end in october , a typical saturday night would be an evening in the local pub with friends - something of a contrast to her cousin prince @entity85 ’s style of letting his hair down			2
then a sunday will see her go swimming followed by a chance to catch up on ‘ all the chores i have n’t done ’			0
‘ i enjoy having sunday lunch with the family and , when it ’s cold and wet outside , watching a film afterwards , ’ she added			0
busy in equestrian career : @entity95 said she was still ' living the @entity4 dream ' after she was presented her medal by her mother @entity98 , but was looking forward to returning to normality in the interview , @entity95 described her favourite item of clothing as ‘ my jeans ’ and her greatest weakness as ‘ shoes ’			1
her favourite things are her husband , her dogs , her family and friends , her car and her @entity114 tablet computer , she said , while asked what she would have been in another life she replied ‘ a sport physio ’			2
on sunday , @entity95 and the rest of the @entity46 eventing quintet will be reunited as they show off their medals at the @entity122			0
favourites : her husband , rugby player @entity40 , her dogs and her family and friends are some of her favourite things no time for honeymoon : even after a year of marriage @entity95 and @entity40 have still not had time to book a honeymoon while thrilled with their silver , she admitted to still being disappointed not to have managed the clear round in the showjumping that might have seen them win gold			1
‘ i could n’t believe how much support we got from the home crowd , ’ she said			0
‘ it was unreal and wonderful - and the crowds were even louder on cross-country day ’ - which happened to be her first wedding anniversary			1
more horse riding : on sunday @entity95 will join the @entity46 team again at the @entity122 favourite clothing : while most people assume she likes getting dressed up , right , or wearing her riding kit , left , for day - to - day life she picks jeans , her ' favourite item of clothing ' , and a hooded jumper the following day , @entity95 and her horse , @entity160 , picked up seven penalties in the show jumping , the final phase , and the team lost out on gold to @entity166			1
‘ yes , i was disappointed in myself for what happened , ’ she said			0
‘ i would have loved to have gone clear but that is the nature of sport - if it was easy then the achievements would n’t mean so much			2
‘ i was delighted with our silver medal			2
you can always look back at what might have been , but the team still came away with a good result at our home games			0
’ disappointed with showjumping : while thrilled with silver , @entity95 admitted being disappointed not to have managed the clear round in showjumping that might have seen the team win gold @entity95 and the rest of the eventing team stayed at the @entity187 , and were as caught up in the spirit of the @entity178 as the rest of the country			0
‘ i felt so honoured to be part of the whole thing , to be there with all those athletes , looking back on so many incredible triumphs , ’ she said			0
with the eventing season still in full flow , @entity95 has had little time to look back on her success			0
and she revealed she and @entity40 still have no idea when they will fit in a honeymoon more than a year after their wedding , not least with the new rugby season about to start			1
‘ we ’d love to go somewhere hot or skiing but who knows when we ’ll get the chance ? ’ she said .			0
