the @entity2 were beaten by 6 - 0 by fellow @entity38 in 1920 - nearly a century ago			0
this was also @entity2 's heaviest @entity5 defeat , the next being their 3 - 0 loss to @entity43 in the @entity44			1
by contrast , @entity45 only scored eight goals during the entire tournament to win the @entity49			0

standing alone : @entity105 became the tournament 's leading scorer with 16 goals @entity109 in @entity24 after devastating @entity1 win all - time record goalscorer at @entity5 @entity105 added salt to @entity37 wounds by netting his 16th goal at the @entity5 finals to move clear of @entity116 as the competition 's all - time leading scorer			1
and , @entity1 have never lost a match where their talisman @entity105 has scored the first goal			2
