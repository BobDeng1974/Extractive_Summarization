@entity0 must take the blame for @entity3 's elimination from the @entity4 , according to former @entity6 boss @entity5			1
the @entity7 failed to qualify from @entity8 after being held 1 - 1 at home by @entity10 on tuesday night when a win was needed to progress			1
@entity0 admitted his side did n't deserve to win and @entity5 believes the @entity3 boss got his tactics against the @entity16 side			1
@entity17 looks forlorn after the final whistle as @entity3 are knocked out of the @entity4 @entity0 must take the blame for @entity3 's defeat to @entity10 , according to former boss @entity5 @entity5 , speaking to the @entity21 show on @entity22 , said : ' the way we approached the game was a bit negative for me			1
we started the game - a game we needed to win â€“ with a really low tempo			2
we did n't put them under pressure and i 'm thinking , " go for them " ' if you need to win , why not put them under pressure from the word go ? we waited until we were down to 10 men with 20 minutes to go and then we throw everything at them			0
we nearly got there but why not do it from the start ? that 's the only gripe i 've got			0
' you can be too tactical , you can over think the whole thing			0
sometimes you need to think , " ok , we need to win this one game , go out and go for it "			0
' @entity10 players celebrate as they begin to sense an upset at the home of the five - time @entity4 winners @entity17 and @entity52 trudge back to the halfway line after the @entity6 fell behind through @entity54 @entity5 managed @entity3 for four years before resigning in 1998 following the arrival of @entity56 former @entity3 defender @entity57 believes the defeat and early elimination from the @entity4 may have cost @entity0 his job and said : ' if things do n't change then ultimately @entity0 will pay the price			1
if this team keeps performing the way it is , i do n't think they will have any other option [ but to sack @entity0 ]			1
' we are not even halfway through the season yet and i 'm guessing most people do n't expect @entity3 to get into the top four			1
' the biggest surprise is how bad the performances are			0
the result against @entity10 was a complete disaster on so many levels			2
the performance level , the fact they are out of the @entity4 and the fact they now go into the @entity82 , which is going to do nothing but harm them in the @entity85			2
' you really wonder where this team is going			0
he has tried to add to the squad to make it better and somehow it has turned the other way			0
it is a team that is completely rudderless			0
if you watched the game against @entity10 and the game against @entity97 , they do n't look to have any imagination going forward , and defensively they look at odds			2
this is just a desperate time for @entity3			2
