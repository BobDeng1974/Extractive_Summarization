by @entity0 @entity1 have banned two fans from going to away games indefinitely - one of them for as little as having a single can of lager found in his bag on the way in to a game			1
@entity10 was stopped on the way in to @entity11 earlier this month and given a police caution , simply because he had an unopened can of @entity14 in his bag			1
as if that was n’t enough , the club have now given him a ban from all domestic and @entity19 away games			1
' banned indefinitely ' - the letter from @entity1			1
an almost identical one was sent to both men a letter , sent to the fan by @entity1 , said : ‘ we have been informed by the @entity26 that you were arrested at the above game and subsequently cautioned for possession of alcohol on entry			1
‘ the club has worked extensively with the @entity33 , the police and a number of local authorities to ensure our supporters are treated fairly and safely when supporting the @entity38 at away grounds			2
this process is also linked to the allocation of tickets given to us as the away support			0
‘ people who breach these safety measures are jeopardising our ticket allocations for future matches			0
‘ as a result you will be banned from attending domestic and @entity19 away matches indefinitely			1
’ @entity10 says he did not even know he had the alcohol on him , as it was at the bottom of the bag he was carrying			1
he claimed on @entity55 that he ‘ honestly thought i had drank [ it ] on the train ’			0
@entity59 the flames : the incident has led to outrage among @entity1 supporters on @entity55 the life - long fan hit out at the club , and says he may even stop going to home games , although his ban is only from away grounds			1
however , the men were allowed to renew their season tickets and will be permitted to attend home games			2
like most football clubs @entity73 do not allow anyone to bring alcohol into the ground or to drink in the stands - although there is a famous video of @entity81 owner @entity80 necking a pint at the @entity83 ( below ) , where it is also illegal			0
this is not an isolated incident involving @entity1			2
another fan , @entity86 has been given an identical ban for being arrested at the same match			2
@entity86 , 22 , from @entity90 in @entity91 , told @entity92 : ' i forgot i had a hip flask when entering the ground , and got arrested for it			0
i was released without charge three hours later , and thought that was the end of it			0
' i renewed my season ticket yesterday morning as well , and they spoke to me like nothing had happened , then i got home from work and the letter was waiting for me , no first strike or nothing just a straight ban for ever			0
' the club does n't care about the supporters , just the money '			0
both fans are planning to appeal in an attempt to overturn the bans			0
the club have taken the action as what fans do could have a negative effect on @entity1 's ticket allocation for future matches .			2

@entity10 had can in his bag when he tried to enter @entity11
*lifelong* @entity1 supporter says he did n't know it was there
