the @entity0 in @entity1 has created the first advertising billboard in the world to make drinking water out of thin air			1
the breakthrough is designed to inspire more young people to pursue careers in engineering			1
it is also meant to show how technology can be used to solve local problems and not always an eyesore in the shape of ... billboards			0
@entity29 , the capital of @entity1 , is the second largest capital in the world that ’s located in a desert and access to drinking water is a problem to its 7 million people			1
over a million have no access to running water at all and rely on private companies to deliver to their homes			1
the city is part of a coastal desert of @entity46 , the driest in the world			0
it depends on drainage from the @entity50 as well as runoff from glacier melt — both sources on the decline because of climate change			0
due to the extremely dry climate , annual precipitation is less than 1 inch , many people draw water from wells that are often polluted – worldwide 2.2 million people die every year from drinking contaminated water			2
many people draw water from wells that are often polluted - 2.2 million people worldwide die every year from drinking contaminated water the city is part of a coastal desert of @entity46 , the driest in the world			2
it depends on drainage from the @entity50 as well as runoff from glacier melt on the other hand , the atmospheric humidity in @entity29 is about 98 per cent			0
the billboard requires electricity to power five generators that make up the billboard ’s inverse osmosis filtration system , capturing the air humidity , condensing and purifying the water , and filling it up in 20 litre tanks			1
the water is then transported through small ducts to a central holding tank at the billboard ’s base , where there is a water faucet			2
how it works : through an air filter into a condenser			0
from there to another filter and into tanks which let the water flow into a faucet the billboard has already produced 9,450 liters of water in just three months , according to @entity101 , which it says equals the water consumption of ' hundreds of families per month '			1

according to @entity27 , the billboard has already produced 9,450 liters of water in just three months , which it says equals the water consumption of ' hundreds of families per month			0
' the university hopes the billboard will lead to more billboards : dozens , hundreds or even thousands of billboards , strategically placed in the city or out - lying villages , might provide enough water for the whole city .			0

@entity0 came up with the idea to transform the country 's high levels of humidity into water
rain is rare but many in the capital do *n't* have direct access to water and rely on deliveries
the billboard captures the air humidity , condensing and purifying the water and fills it up in tanks
