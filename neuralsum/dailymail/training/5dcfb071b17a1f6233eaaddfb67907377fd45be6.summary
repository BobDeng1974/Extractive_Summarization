by @entity0 published : 04:44 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 19:18 est , 12 june 2012 yours for less than £ 1million , an entire row of cottages ... with one very large street light			1
perched on the top of a cliff , the five properties boast south - facing gardens and sea views			1
but there is one snag – you will probably need extra-thick curtains because there ’s a fully - operational lighthouse and helipad on your doorstep			2
awesome view : four of the five cottages date back to 1938 with the last built around 1970 @entity21 : the five properties can be seen , right , next to a helicopter launch pad and a lighthouse which is now unoccupied the cottages situated on @entity25 on the south west tip of @entity27 in @entity28 used to be used as accommodation for lighthouse keepers			1
but they have been empty for over a decade since the lighthouse became automated			1
consisting of four three - bedroom houses and one with two bedrooms , the whole row is on the market for £ 950,000			0
they are currently owned by @entity38 , which maintains all of the functioning lighthouses in @entity40 and @entity28			0
@entity42 , of @entity43 - based chartered surveyors @entity44 and @entity45 , said : ‘ this is a fantastic opportunity to purchase a property in a unique and idyllic coastal location			0
‘ they offer a perfect opportunity for someone looking for a renovation project			1
’ it would be the perfect hideaway for anyone who has sung along to the song : ' i want to marry a lighthouse keeper ... ' the terrace of cottages has been lying empty for a decade and they are being sold by @entity38 who run all the lighthouses in @entity40 and @entity28			1
they have been given a list price of £ 950,000			0
the two lighthouses on the section of coastline have been electrified since 1998			0
estate agent @entity42 said : ' it is a fantastic opportunity to purchase a property in a unique and idyllic coastal location			0
' the cottages were previously used to house the lighthouse keepers and their families , looking after various lights along the @entity27 coastline			1
lighthouse keeper 's properties with a sea view : the five clifftop properties at @entity25 in @entity27 , three miles from the nearest town			1
the lighthouse is not for sale ' the cottages have been vacant for approximately 10 years - and are in need refurbishment			2
' however , they offer a perfect opportunity for someone looking for a renovation project			2
' the idyllic cottages are part of a complex of properties at the remote spot			1
also on the site but not for sale are two lighthouses , a helipad , a helicopter transit lounge and a former fog horn house			2
the money from the sale will go to the @entity38 which has maintained lighthouses and safety for mariners since they were granted a @entity106 in 1514			0
four of the five cottages date back to 1938 with the last built around 1970			2
a lighthouse has been on the site since 1712 to warn seafarers of the dangerous jagged rocks jutting in the @entity112			1
miss @entity42 , of @entity43 - based agents @entity44 and @entity45 , said : ' two lighthouses were were fuelled by coal fires			0
amazing sea view : the row of cottages which are also available for sale individually			2
they are all in a poor state of repair stunning : the five properties , available for less than £ 1m together , have some of the best coastal views in @entity125 but all require modernisation as they have been empty for a decade ' the existing lighthouse tower was constructed in 1844			1
the lighthouse was electrified in 1958 and automated in 1998			0
' the lighthouse will carry on blinking away on the headland as a warning to shipping lighting up the night sky outside			0
the nearest village of @entity135 is three miles away - but the real beauty is the panoramic views of the islands of @entity139 and @entity140 with puffins , manx shearwaters and guillemots			0
four of the five homes have three bedrooms while the last one has two bedrooms			0
each boasts nine - inch thick walls to withstand the battering of the sea and winds			0
but miss @entity42 warned : ' the cottages have been vacant for some time and require total refurbishment			1
but it could be a bargain for the right person			0
' remote hideaway : the five terraced homes at @entity160 , are at one of the most westerly points in @entity28 run down : the properties were occupied by lighthouse keepers but the lighthouses were electrified in 1998 so they are no longer needed green : the cottages have stunning views and there is a helicopter pad nearby			1
it is thought that a developer may purchase them to renovate spectacular : the row of five terraced properties virtually stand alone on the remote , but beautiful , stretch of coastline @entity179 paradise : four of the five homes have three bedrooms while the last one has two bedrooms			1
each boasts nine - inch thick walls to withstand the battering of the sea and winds remote : remarkable aerial image of the coastline shows just how isolated the five properties are			2

five terraced properties at @entity25 , @entity27 , are being sold off together
but they have been empty for the last decade and require major renovation
@entity197 has been on the site since 1712 but it is now *unmanned* and the cottages have been abandoned
