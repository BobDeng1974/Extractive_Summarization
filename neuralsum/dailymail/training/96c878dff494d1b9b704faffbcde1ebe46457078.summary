president @entity0 came out swinging on wednesday just 14 hours after a @entity2 wave swept over the @entity3 in an election that largely repudiated his policies			1
' @entity3 will pass some bills i can not sign , ' he said , threatening to dust off a veto pen that he has used only twice in nearly six years			1
and he hinted at executive orders that will enrage conservatives			1
' i 'm pretty sure i 'll take some actions that some in @entity3 will not like , ' he said			1
that 's how @entity16 works			0
' much of reporters ' tussling with the president focused on executive orders related to immigration reform – what some tea party @entity2 call an ' amnesty ' – which he plans to implement this year			1
he acknowledged that the @entity2 won tuesday 's elections , but framed the results as a mandate for republicans to work with him , instead of the other way around			1
' obviously the @entity2 had a good night , ' he said			1
' ' i want to just see what works , ' he said			0
' the @entity54 people sent a message , ' he claimed , ' one that they 've sent for several elections now			0
' ' they expect the people they elect to work as hard as they do			0
they expect us to focus on their ambitions , and not ours			0
' he then rattled off a list of economic indicators that he said buttressed his case that @entity2 should accept his point of view			1
' more americans are working			0
unemployment has come down , ' he claimed , glossing over the part - time employment shift that the @entity73 law 's employer mandate has ushered in			2
' our economy is outpacing most of the world			0
but we 've just got ta keep at it			0
much of that will take action from @entity3			1
and i 'm eager to work with the next @entity3			1
' he cited infrastructure building projects and international trade as areas where he thought his agenda overlaps with the @entity2 's			1
responding to hot - button questions about the fate of @entity73 in the age of a @entity91 , the president did n't budge			2
he said he would only work with @entity2 if they seek to ' make responsible changes ' to the law			1
' i 'm going to be very receptive to hearing those ideas			0
' ' despite all the contention , ' @entity0 claimed , ' we now know that the law works			2
' and he pledged to avoid last year 's chronic website snafus the next time around			2
' we 're really making sure the website works super well before the next open enrollment period , ' he said			0
' we 're double - and triple'checking it			0
' addressing his relationship with the new @entity104 majority leader , @entity0 chuckled at a question about whether he might sit down with him for a drink			2
' i would enjoy having some @entity44 bourbon with @entity43 , ' the president said			0
' he has always been very straightforward with me			0
to his credit , he has never made a promise that he could n't deliver			0
and he knows the legislative process well			0
he obviously know his caucus well			0
' ' what i 'm not gon na do is just wait , ' @entity0 said , pledging to take executive action on immigration by year 's end @entity121 , he told reporters , has ' always given me realistic assessments of what he can get through his caucus and what he ca n't , so i think we can have a productive relationship			1
' @entity0 also announced that he has sent @entity3 a funding request for $ 6.18 billion in new funds to fight the @entity130 crisis at home and in @entity132			1
and he surprised many by saying he would ask @entity3 for a new @entity134 to help him prosecute a flagging war against the self - described @entity136 ( @entity137 ) , the terror army that has slaughtered indiscriminately in its quest for a regional caliphate			2
the move is a 180 - degree turn from he administration 's previous position that a @entity146 - era congressional permission slip was more than adequate to deal with turmoil in @entity148 and @entity149			2
' we now have a different type of enemy , ' @entity0 said wednesday , echoing @entity2 ' objections months ago			1
' the strategy is different			0
' '' it makes sense for us to make sure that the authorization from @entity3 reflects what we perceive to be not just out strategy over the next two to three months , ' he said , but also our strategy moving forward			2
the president also challenged the lame - duck @entity3 , with a @entity104 still run by the election - wounded @entity164 democrat @entity163 , to ' pass a budget for the rest of the fiscal year ' in just five weeks , and to do it in a ' bipartisan , drama - free way			1
' and he did n't budge on immigration , despite the second midterm election shellacking of his presidency			0
what landslide ? @entity0 did n't acknowledge a single policy where he would shift his point of view to align with the new @entity2 congressional majority ' i have consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see @entity3 act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill , ' @entity0 said			1
that sort of bill passed the @entity104 in 2013 but was dead on arrival in the @entity39			0
with a larger @entity2 majority in the @entity39 and a newly minted @entity104 majority as well , that plan seems even less likely to succeed now			2
@entity0 pledged to ' do everything i can in my executive authority ' to take ' whatever lawful actions that i can take that i believe will improve our immigration system			1
' and he dared the @entity2 to see things his way			2
executive orders , he said , ' will be replaced and supplanted by a bill from @entity3			1
' ' you send me a bill that i can sign and those executive actions go away			1
but he cautioned : ' what i 'm not gon na do is just wait			0

' @entity3 will pass some bills i can not sign , ' the president warned
he has only vetoed two minor bills since his *inauguration* in 2009
and ' i 'll take some actions that some in @entity3 will not like , ' @entity0 added , referring to threatened executive orders
those *include* a bold move on immigration ' before the end of the year '
president sounded more like a winner than a loser despite his policies being repudiated on a national scale
@entity227 articulated a single policy where he would shift his position to align with @entity2 majorities in both houses of @entity3
