by @entity0 published : 09:12 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 09:12 est , 12 september 2013 scientists discover that @entity3 peppers , a popular ingredient in @entity5 , contain a chemical that activates touch sensors in the mouth for some people when it comes to spicy food , the hotter the better , yet for others the mouth numbness and tingling caused by eating chillies is just painful			1
but what causes this sensation and why does it vary from person to person ? previous theories found that chillis contain chemicals that activate hot and cold sensors in the mouth , yet new research from the @entity25 has discovered another chemical capable of activating the sensors that respond to touch			1
called sanshool , it is found in @entity3 peppers and can access parts of the lips that connect to the area of the brain associated with touch			1
although study co-author @entity36 , a cognitive neuroscientist at the university admits he is unsure exactly how or why it happens			0
@entity3 peppers , also known as zanthoxylum piperitum , are found predominantly in @entity5 and across the @entity42			1
it is a common ingredient in spicy @entity45 cooking and has a reputation for causing tingling lips and making the mouth feel numb			2
the authors compare this to the same feeling created by touching a live electrical current			0
chillies are part of the capsicum family of plants that contain chemical compounds called capsaicinoids , such as menthol and , the most prevalent , capsaicin			0
when placed inside the mouth , these chemicals activate the parts of the tongue that can determine if food is hot or cold			1
the peppers from @entity3 additionally contain a chemical called sanshool , that activates touch sensors			1
during tests , @entity36 placed @entity3 pepper powder onto the lips of 28 male participants			2
each of the men reported numbing and tingling sensations			0
powder from @entity3 peppers , pictured , was put onto the lips of participants			1
their fingers were then vibrated and they were asked whether the tingling on their lips felt faster or slower than the vibrations			0
researchers discovered @entity3 peppers created a feeling of 50 vibrations a second - the rate in which nerves sense touch an @entity96 scientist claims that personality might determine whether you like spicy food			1
@entity101 's research examined the link between peoples ' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot spices such as chilli			0
it found that people who seek adventure and intense sensations like spicy food more than those who avoid risky situations			2

the peppers from @entity3 additionally contain a chemical called sanshool , that activates touch sensors			1
their fingers were then vibrated using a machine and @entity36 asked them whether the tingling on their lips felt faster or slower than the movement on their hands			0
by changing the vibrational frequency , @entity36 was able to determine that the @entity3 peppers created a feeling of about 50 vibrations per second			1
this is the rate in which nerves sense light touches on the skin			0
@entity36 told @entity143 that the findings could be used to discover exactly how taste affects the brain and why it differs from person to person			2
earlier this year , an @entity96 scientist claimed that personality might determine whether someone likes spicy food or not			2
@entity101 's research examined the link between peoples ' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot spices such as chilli			0

@entity3 peppers are so spicy they activate touch sensors in the lips
previous theories thought that chemicals caused the lips to tingle
researchers admit it 's *unclear* how that peppers access the sensors
findings could help determine how taste changes between people
