when the @entity1 stepped out in navy blue in @entity3 last night , it offered yet more evidence of her growing penchant for the @entity6			1
chic in a flowing @entity8 gown worn with show stopping jewels and an elegant up - do , the @entity1 looked every inch the princess as she made her way inside on the arm of husband @entity15			1
but her embrace of darker hues is a far cry from the early years of her marriage , when the fledgling royal opted for inky colours by day but picked show - stopping gowns in pale shades of cream , lilac and nude by night			1
last night 's floor - length navy gown was n't even the first time the @entity1 turned to the dark side in @entity3 , with @entity1 making her @entity47 debut in a delicate lace dress by eco-label , @entity50			1
the brand , a favourite of the @entity1 ' , is run by her old school friend @entity53 , and is famous for its flowing , body - skimming dresses - all of which comes in handy when there 's a bump to conceal			2
with the exception of the bright pink @entity63 coat worn to visit the 9/11 memorial , most of her day wear came in dark shades too , most notably the glamorous £ 680 goat coat worn for a visit to the @entity68 in @entity69			2
but it is her embrace of dark partywear that has garnered the @entity1 the highest number of headlines , beginning with the stunning @entity76 gown worn to meet stars - among them @entity80 's @entity79 - at the @entity81 late last month			1
second time around : the gown was on its second outing this year , having been worn to the @entity84 in @entity85 in february good look : @entity27 began her tour of @entity3 in black @entity50 ( right ) but chose @entity88 and @entity8 for a reception last month with its pretty lace sleeves and sweetheart neckline , the dramatic number added a shot of demure glamour to the night - and eclipsed the more colourfully dressed a-listers who also attended			1
a day later and @entity1 was back in black , this time for a @entity97 reception			2
this time though , the @entity1 dispensed with designer in favour of @entity101 staple @entity88 , teaming a sheer polka dot blouse by the brand with a skirt by @entity8			2
and the @entity1 certainly is n't alone in her love of an @entity106			0
both @entity107 and the classic @entity108 have long been a party season staple , with sales of the dresses increasing by 29 per cent as december approaches , according to department store @entity113			0
' the garment that the majority of clients have said they want is that elusive little black dress , ' commented a spokesperson for the store			2
' the perfect one will take you from a cocktail party to an opera , from a @entity123 starred restaurant to a night club , without missing a beat			2
a dress that can do that is certainly worth the effort			0
' glamorous : @entity27 concealed her tiny bump in a gorgeous @entity76 gown for the @entity81 in november stunning : @entity1 's love of black lace reappeared once more at last year 's @entity135 ball when she chose a @entity137 cocktail dress dazzling : @entity1 opted for @entity8 on her final night in @entity138 and picked black for a @entity85 charity gala earlier this year like the rest of us , the @entity142 ' love of the lbd and the @entity106 has been a lengthy affair			1
already a fan of inky day wear , since giving birth to @entity149 in july 2013 , black and navy have become an increasingly important part of her evening wardrobe			1
after wowing the crowds in red and navy during the day , @entity1 opted for a £ 2,145 bespoke @entity8 dress - complete with a glittering crystal fern - for a reception on her final night in @entity138			1
then , there was a glamorous knee - length @entity159 cocktail dress , once again made from her favourite black lace , which she wore to a @entity135 ball in late 2013			1
although the majority of her pre-pregnancy gowns came in vibrant shades of red or nude , black did manage the odd appearance , most notably at the @entity85 premiere of @entity170 in 2012			0
dramatic : @entity27 loves a black lace gown for evening and opted for this show - stopping number at the @entity175 premiere in 2012 early outing : despite her youthful penchant for brights and whites , the @entity1 did occasionally embrace black in her pre-royal days it is n't only her clever way with @entity183 that has made the @entity1 a sartorial sensation during her tour of the @entity47 - her chic maternity style has made headlines as well			1
this , says style expert @entity188 , is all down to her embrace of the coat - dress which manages to combine formal glamour with space for the royal bump			0
' @entity27 of @entity196 has toured the world 's style capital wearing a succession of winter dress coats , ' she explains			1
' it 's clever one - piece dressing that does n't overtly draw attention to her bump			0
' note that we 've barely caught a glimpse of the outfit underneath - @entity1 's chic coat choices do all the work			0
she 's even kept accessories to a minimum			0
' but it 's not only pregnant women who can benefit from a tailored coat			0
' as @entity1 demonstrates , these tailored coats are surprisingly versatile whether you 're pregnant or not , ' adds @entity217			0
' for a formal vibe , she teamed her monochrome goat crepe coat with black opaques and heels but gave her @entity223 bouclé coat a more relaxed spin for the basketball layering it over a pair of skinny trousers			0
' her overcoat collection struck the perfect balance for the couple 's royal tour duties			0
floaty maternitywear and stretch waistbands could have looked too casual , while clingy bodycon would have been inappropriate			0

@entity27 of @entity196 has embraced the @entity237 - since becoming a *mother* in 2013
since announcing her second pregnancy , she has relied on black and navy for evening events and galas
in @entity3 , she wore black @entity246 on her first evening and navy @entity8 on the last night
other recent hits *include* the black lace @entity76 gown worn to the @entity81
