sir @entity7 told the @entity23 it was not possible to stop all illegal migration			0
he said : ‘ i can not look this committee in the eye and say i can operate 100 per cent control so 100 per cent of clandestines will not get across the border			2

border chiefs have already pushed back the start date for the checks by one week to avoid introducing the new system over the busy @entity46 weekend			2
checks will involve operators recording passport information on all travellers and passing the details on to the @entity51 , which will use the details to identify immigration offenders			0
however , sir @entity7 told @entity55 coach parties of children under 16 would be excluded to reduce delays			2
he added : ‘ the coach sector is the most difficult of all logistically and that has been the focus of trials and testing			2

i ’m confident we will have a solution come the live date			0

but transport firms said that rather than deporting any captured stowaways back to their home countries , @entity98 is simply releasing them to have another go at breaching @entity4 ’s borders			1
