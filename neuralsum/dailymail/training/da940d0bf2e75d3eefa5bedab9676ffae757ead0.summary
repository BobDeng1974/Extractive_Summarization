by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 11:34 est , 26 september 2013 a seven - year - old boy died in a fire in a slum house after the wealthy landlord who owned the property left the batteries out of the smoke alarm			1
@entity8 , 50 , has been jailed for taking a series of health and safety shortcuts across the 14 properties he owned in @entity13 , @entity14 , which left them ' like a death - trap '			1
there was only one smoke detector in the terraced house where young @entity20 lived , a court heard , and its battery had been disconnected , meaning it failed to go off when a fire broke out due to an electrical fault			1
death - trap : landlord @entity8 , pictured left , had not ensured there were adequate smoke alarms of fire exits in the house where seven - year - old @entity20 , right , died in a blaze there were also no fire doors in the premises and the front door could only be opened from the inside with a key - preventing the occupants from escaping quickly			1
firefighters battled to rescue the boy after the blaze took hold of the property in @entity44 on may 22 last year			0
but he suffocated after inhaling thick plumes of smoke			0
an inquest heard that if the fire alarm had been fitted then the youngster would have probably survived			0
earlier this year @entity8 - who himself lives in a swanky £ 350,000 detached house in @entity13 - pleaded guilty to failing to take general fire precautions at nine properties he owned in run - down areas of the town			1
he was jailed yesterday for nine months by judge @entity56 and also ordered to pay £ 7,500 in costs			0
slum : investigators inspect the scene of the house fire in @entity44 , @entity13 , one of 14 properties owned by @entity8 - eight of which were deemed unsafe prosecutor @entity65 told the court : ' legislation means that the person responsible for a property is required legally to maintain a standard of fire safety to properly secure the safety of the occupants			1
' the fire precautions fell woefully short at @entity44 and the fire subsequently claimed the life of a seven - year - old boy			2
' the lengths taken to prevent fire at other properties owned by @entity8 was grossly inadequate			1
' @entity81 heard that most of the houses for which @entity8 faced charges were lived in by several people - known as houses of multiple occupancy - which greatly increased the risk of fire			2
two other men , who acted as property managers for @entity8 , escaped jail after being sentenced for the same charges relating to different properties			1
managers : @entity94 ( left ) and @entity95 ( right ) will serve suspended sentences and undertake unpaid work @entity98 , 45 , from @entity13 , was handed a four - month sentence , suspended for 12 months , and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work			2
and @entity95 , 41 , from @entity13 , was sentenced to three months , suspended for 12 months , and ordered to do 175 hours of unpaid work			2
the pair were also ordered to pay £ 2,000 in court costs			0
speaking outside court , @entity105 , chief fire officer of @entity106 , said : ' this case clearly demonstrates how seriously fire safety breaches are viewed by the courts			0
' i hope it sends a clear message to landlords and managing agents across the county			0
' he added that fire services actively investigate houses of multiple occupancy as they are the highest risk premises , often housing vulnerable people who might be exploited by landlords			0
the failure to take general fire precaution charges relates to breaches of the @entity125 ( fire safety ) order			0
under the order the person responsible for a property must ensure adequate fire alarms and protectors are in place in a property , adequate emergency escape routes and exits are in place , and adequate ' fire compartmenation ' is in place , to prevent the spread of fire and smoke .			2
