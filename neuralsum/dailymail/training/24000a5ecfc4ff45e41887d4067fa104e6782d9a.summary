by @entity0 researchers have warned of an impending health epidemic caused by a huge rise in the number of students smoking hookah pipes			1
a new study found 18 % of high school seniors have reported engaging in behavior researchers describe as ' equivalent to smoking 10 - 40 cigarettes in a single sitting , and then kissing everybody as well '			1
researchers say the students are unaware of the potential health risks - and believe new , small hookah ' pens ' similar to e-cigarettes could lead to major health problems			1
a new study found 18 % of high school seniors have smoked hookahs - and say it could lead to a health epidemic @entity23 , an ancient form of smoking , in which charcoal - heated tobacco or non-tobacco based shisha smoke is passed through water before inhalation , is rapidly gaining popularity among adolescents in the @entity34			1
the new study by researchers affiliated with @entity38 's @entity37 and @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , in the august 2014 edition of @entity42 identifies how prevalent hookah use is and which teens are most likely to be using it			1
the researchers found the annual prevalence ( use in the last 12 months ) of hookah use was nearly 1 in 5 high school seniors			1
' what we find most interesting is that students of higher socioeconomic status appear to be more likely to use hookah , ' said @entity55 of @entity56			1
' surprisingly , students with more educated parents or higher personal income are at high risk for use			1
' we also found that hookah use is more common in cities , especially big cities			2
' so hookah use is much different from cigarette use , which is more common in non-urban areas			0
' the study , ' @entity68 , ' used data from @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , a nation - wide ongoing annual study of the behaviors , attitudes , and values of @entity34 secondary school students			1
the @entity72 survey is administered in approximately 130 public and private schools throughout 48 states in the @entity34			0
studies estimate one hookah session can be the equivalent of smoking from 10 to 40 cigarettes			2
roughly 15,000 high school seniors are assessed annually			1
this study examined data from the 5,540 students ( modal age = 18 ) who were asked about hookah use from 2010 - 2012			1
the researchers found those students who smoked cigarettes , and those who had ever used alcohol , marijuana or other illicit substances were more likely to use hookah			2
' however , times are beginning to change , ' said dr. @entity55			0
' now something called hookah pens , which are similar to e-cigarettes , are gaining popularity			0
' while not all hookah pens contain nicotine , this new delivery method might normalize hookah use in everyday settings and bring use to a whole new level			0
' researchers conclude increased normalization might lead to increases in use , and possibly adverse consequences associated with repeated use			0
studies estimate one hookah session can be the equivalent of smoking from 10 to 40 cigarettes			2
dr. @entity123 of the @entity124 said that 's because of the long duration of a hookah session			0
' when you smoke a cigarette , a person smokes it maybe for just a few minutes and then you 're through with it			0
' but hookah sessions are social and people sit there for an hour or so kind of puffing on these things , thinking that the water is filtering out all the bad stuff , when the reality is it does not do that , ' @entity123 said			0
a study funded by the @entity141 reports a single hookah session delivers 1.7 times the nicotine , 6.5 times the carbon monoxide and 46.4 times the tar of a single cigarette			2
' tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke are the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the @entity34 , ' said a study co-author @entity153 , @entity154 , a professor of pediatrics and of @entity156 at the @entity56			2
' cigarette use has decreased by 33 % in the past decade in the @entity34 , while the use of alternative tobacco products such as hookahs has increased an alarming 123 %			0
' this is especially worrisome given the public misperception that hookahs are a safe alternative to cigarettes whereas evidence suggests that they are even more damaging to health than are cigarettes			0
' this portends a potential epidemic of a lethal habit growing among upper and middle class adolescents .			0
