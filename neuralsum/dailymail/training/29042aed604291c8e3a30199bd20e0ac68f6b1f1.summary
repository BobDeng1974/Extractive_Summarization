for a manager who arrived at @entity2 with a reputation for shunning knockout competitions , it now appears that @entity5 has finally discovered the magic of the @entity7			2
when @entity5 took over at @entity8 last summer , he was reportedly told by his employers to take the cups seriously , after using the games to rest several first team members at @entity13			0
but what perhaps @entity14 did not envisage was the @entity17 coach plotting a trip to the recording studio should @entity8 reach the @entity7 final , following in the footsteps of @entity8 's 1981 cup hero @entity22			1
@entity8 manager @entity5 has not ruled out making an @entity7 final song if @entity8 get there @entity22 pictured singing his solo line in @entity8 's @entity7 final song @entity27 ( left ) and team - mate @entity28 pose outside @entity29 before the 1981 @entity7 final @entity27 ( right ) holds the cup aloft alongside @entity8 team - mate @entity32 @entity22 and his team - mates recorded the infamous @entity34 with @entity35 that year , with the song reaching no 5 in the charts as @entity8 lifted the cup after beating @entity39 3 - 2 in a replay			1
' i know all about @entity34 , ' confessed @entity5 to @entity42 ' i have heard the song and even seen a video of it			0
' would i record a song with @entity35 if we get to the final this season ? maybe			0
yes , why not ? ' @entity5 stopped short at saying he would be singing too much on any potential collaboration			0
' i would let my staff sing because they have good voices and i do n't ! ' @entity5 and his squad could team up with @entity35 to record a new version of the song the @entity8 manager wants to recreate the scenes of excitement shown in the @entity7 single the song made it up to no 5 in the music charts and inspired the club to @entity7 glory while @entity8 supporters will now undoubtedly be hoping to hear a team single ahead of a cup final , music lovers across the nation will be hoping @entity5 is not about to usher in a new era of football songs			1
it has become less of tradition in recent years , but still one responsible for tunes such as @entity76 by @entity77 ahead of the 1988 fa cup final and @entity79 ( @entity80 ) by @entity81 ahead of their @entity7 triumph in 1996			2
@entity8 take on @entity83 at @entity2 in the @entity7 fourth round on saturday .			1

@entity8 hero @entity22 made a cup final song with @entity35
@entity5 *joked* he will do the same if @entity8 get there
