he said : ' i 'm not too happy about it			0
that 's my flat behind the window			0

i went straight to the bathroom and took a shower with the dog in the room making sure nothing else happened			0
' mr @entity8 , manager of the pub , lives in a flat behind the window where the flickering light appeared he said : ' it was creepy , but my attitude is as long the ghost does n't harm me then that 's fine			2
