i do n't think i will shock anyone when i predict @entity2 will win by two goals			1
they have been played with confidence and mastery - clinical and composed			0
@entity7 have barely got over the line			0
they simply have n't been exhilarating at any point and with no team pattern of play , they 're a bit like @entity15 in that respect			0
when they come up against a well - drilled @entity2 team , it is going to be tough			0
disappointing : @entity7 have n't been exhilarating at any point and with no team pattern of play what @entity7 must do to win 1 they need to play to win			2
so far they have played to not get beaten - that wo n't win you a @entity28			2
2 they need to keep the ball			0
if @entity2 do n't have it , they ca n't score , and if @entity7 have the ball , they can			1
3 @entity34 is the player who can win this for them but his team - mates need to give him the ball much higher up the pitch than they have been			1
he needs to be receiving the ball in the final third so he has n't got a long way to get to the goal			2
@entity2 are going to be watching @entity34 like a hawk			2
get the ball to him when he 's as close to the @entity45 goal as possible , then let him do his magic â€¦ that 's the best chance they 've got			0
plan : if @entity7 have the ball , @entity2 need to crowd @entity34 out of the game like @entity52 did what @entity2 must do to win			1
1 @entity2 need to keep possession			0
basically , their task is to keep the ball away from @entity34 , and the simplest way to do this is to keep hold of the ball			2
if @entity7 do n't have the ball , they ca n't pass it to @entity34			1
2 if @entity7 have the ball , @entity2 need to crowd @entity34 out of the game like @entity52 did in their semi-final			1
pour pressure on to him , and do n't leave any holes in the midfield - @entity34 gets through those gaps			1
3 they need to play with the same positivity as they have throughout this tournament			0
if @entity77 's team go forward and play to win like they did against @entity15 , they will be very difficult to beat do n't give @entity2 an inch @entity7 have to keep their back four tight and not allow big spaces between them and midfield ( shaded area )			1
@entity15 were punished when @entity2 got in that space and players made great runs to create the space for the guy with the ball to hit the killer pass or shoot .			0

@entity7 need to give the ball to @entity34 higher up the pitch
@entity7 must play to win , so far they have played to not get beaten
@entity2 ca n't leave holes in their midfield during *sunday* 's final
