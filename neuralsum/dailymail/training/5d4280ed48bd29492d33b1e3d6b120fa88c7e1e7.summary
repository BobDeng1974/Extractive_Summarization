by @entity0 studies nationwide about ' sea star wasting syndrome ' , or the rash of deaths of millions of starfish , have come up with a new explanation this week			1
scientists have been observing the shores of @entity9 , @entity10 , and @entity11 in an attempt to figure out why millions of sea stars have been dying since june 2013			2
their conclusion is that sea stars are being infected with a disease that can more easily grow in the @entity17 thanks to warming waters providing a better place to multiply			1

scientists are trying to determine if the pathogen is traveling freely in the warm waters or if its coming from the mussels and shellfish that sea stars eat a sunflower star exhibiting signs that its about to lose two of its arms an arm from a sick sea star detached from the body			1
this is known as a ray , ' walking away ' from the body according to scientists , the warmer waters not only allow the bacterial / viral infection a more prime place to develop , but also compromise the immune system of the sea stars , allowing them to be more susceptible to the pathogen causing sea star wasting syndrome			1
according to research from the @entity55 , the disease leaves lesions on the body of sea stars , also causing deformities such as arms disappearing			1
the end result are carcasses washing to shore in a dried - up , gnarled state			0
according to a team monitoring the @entity65 , off of the coast of @entity9 , over 40 percent of starfish are now exhibiting symptoms of having sea star wasting syndrome			1
that number is expected to rise as the summer progresses			0
' it ’s the largest mortality event for marine diseases we ’ve seen , ' @entity71 , a marine epidemiologist at @entity72 , told @entity76			1
' it affects over 20 species on our coast and it ’s been causing catastrophic mortality			0
' @entity71 leads a loose organization of scientists who are struggling to figure out the cause of the mass die - offs			0
according to her , the warmer @entity17 waters of recent years have facilitated a prime environment for the pathogen to develop			2
this would not be the first mass die - off experienced by the sea star population			2
according to scientists , the sea star population experienced hits during the warmer climate related to @entity97 years , particularly 1982 - 83 and 1997 - 98			1
however , these dips in population were never as severe as the current outbreak			0

the disease is expected to worsen as the summer progresses ' my expectation is that within the next month all of the stars will die			0
' said @entity71 while some scientists believe that the warmer water is weakening the sensitive skins of sea stars , others believe that the pathogen is traveling to them through the food that they eat becoming infected			2
in a test at the @entity124 , two groups of sea stars were fed differently , the first receiving mussels from the same area of the ocean , while the other group was given frozen squid			0
the group given the frozen squid to eat did not develop the disease , while the animals given the mussels they would normally eat did come down with the sickness			0
however , the sample size of the study was to small to derive any hard conclusions from			0
sea stars are known as an ' apex predator ' in the intertidal zone , surviving on mussels and other shellfish			0
' losing a predator like that is bound to have some pretty serious ecological consequences and we really do n’t know exactly how the system is going to look , ' says @entity71 ' but we ’re quite certain that it ’s going to have an impact			0
' currently , scientists hope that young sea stars develop a resistance to the disease , allowing them to live full lives and for the population to recover from their losses .			2

scientists believe that disease , ' sea star wasting syndrome ' , linked to warmer than usual waters in the @entity17
over 40 percent of sea stars are showing symptoms of having the disease
disease causes lesions and decay of sea star bodies , resulting in a mangled form
' it ’s the largest mortality event for marine diseases we ’ve seen ' says scientist
