be your best you : @entity2 , pictured at a @entity4 afterparty , says many of the women she made over on @entity6 had lost confidence i ’ve always been fascinated by the power of a first impression			1
when you walk into an interview , a meeting , to a first date , or even just down the street – statistically you ’re judged by others within eight seconds			2
that ’s fast , and brutal			0
it would be great if those around us did n’t make assumptions based on appearance , but the harsh reality is , almost everyone does			2
so , it ’s important to give yourself the best chance : to give your outfit some thought and make that first impression count			0
clothes and make - up are certainly not as important as what ’s on the inside , but i believe they should at least reflect a person ’s best qualities			0
many of the women i made over on @entity40 were selling themselves short			0
they were funny , intelligent , kind and generous , but they had lost their way and their confidence , and it showed in the way they projected themselves – dressing like they ’d given up and could n’t care less			0
it ’s not about spending a fortune on new clothes or having your hair blown out every day , but making small changes – figuring out the silhouette that flatters your figure best ; wearing brighter color to express your personality ; trying a little makeup to give your skin a glow ; having fun with accessories			0
@entity62 [ @entity63 , @entity2 's co-host ] and i are all about giving tips to help women watching the show find their very own style , to make the very best first impression possible			1
and we had fun doing it ! take @entity72 , for example , the lovely lady you see in this video clip			1
she 's a dedicated mom , sparky , hilarious and full of life			2
the kind of woman that , after five minutes chatting with her , you want to open a bottle of wine with and laugh all night			2
her story is like so many other women : after years running around after her kids , with a full time job , she multi-tasks from dawn til dusk and puts herself at the end of a very long priority list			0
@entity72 just did n't see herself as important enough to shine anymore , or to turn heads when she walked into a room			1
emotional : @entity72 sheds a tear when she hears what the jury has to say about her appearance the comments our secret jury made about her when she first walked into the room , were honest and raw , and of course , upsetting			1
it was a horrible moment for @entity72 to hear strangers ' first impressions , but it was also a defining , pivotal moment that lead her to make a big change			1
@entity62 and i taught @entity72 about body shape , how to wear print , how to wear comfy heels ( yes i promise they exist ! ) and how to fix her hair so it did n't look like a messy mushroom ( her words , not mine )			1
turning point : @entity2 says it was a horrible moment for @entity72 to hear strangers ' first impressions , but it was also a defining , pivotal moment that lead her to make a big change brutal : @entity2 's co-host @entity63 ( far left ) seen with the jury shortly before they deliver their verdicts when her daughter and best friend saw the final result , well i wo n't ruin the surprise , but let 's just say there was a new person , inside and out , standing before them			1
making a good first impression is a mindset just as much as an outfit			0
if you feel confident on the inside , it radiates on the outside			0
@entity142 that off with a well - fitting , attention - grabbing look , and i 'm not exaggerating when i say the world is your oyster			0
