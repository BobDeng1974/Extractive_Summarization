former top counter-terror police officer @entity21 was asked to review the handling of extremism in schools over more than a decade mr @entity2 told @entity66 ’s @entity65 programme : ‘ there are broader questions about the extent to which these activities were coordinated and the extent to which those responsible for these activities may have had a broader agenda			1
‘ @entity21 is looking into that and we have to wait to see what he concludes ... ‘ there are questions for the local authority and of course for my department , the @entity83 about what was known and what was done			2
’ he defended his decision to appoint mr @entity21 , the former @entity87 head of counter-terrorism , to lead the investigation			2
‘ there was some criticism , right at the beginning of this process , when i appointed @entity21			2
people felt that it was in some respects , too dramatic and authoritarian a step			0
' but the view that i took was if you have a police officer of unimpeachable integrity to conduct these investigations , if people are at the end of this process cleared , given a clean bill of health , then that is the most effective way of ensuring that public confidence can be restored			0
’ mr @entity21 ’s report is expected to be published later this summer			0

' we need to challenge those views and we need to make sure that people who have views that are inimical to liberal values and wish to use institutions to push an agenda which is inimical to liberal values are not in a position where they can use public money or the public square in order to push their views			1
' mr @entity2 - who has previously clashed publicly with home secretary @entity155 over the government 's handling of the issue - went out of his way to praise her			2
