@entity0 has been selected in the back row as @entity2 seek to bounce back from the end of their @entity5 dream by defeating @entity7 on friday night			1
@entity0 has spent the vast majority of his fledgling union career at inside or outside centre , but head coach @entity11 will examine his credentials at blindside flanker in the @entity15 showdown at @entity16			1
the former rugby league star has struggled to make an impact in the midfield since converting to union towards the end of last year and @entity22 has repeatedly stated that he views the back row as the most suitable home for his explosive ball - carrying and defence			2
@entity0 has featured mainly at centre for @entity2 since his arrival from the @entity28 @entity0 leaves the pitch following his side 's @entity31 defeat by @entity33 on saturday @entity0 was called into @entity36 's @entity35 squad to step - up his education in the new code , although he was never considered for selection by the @entity40 who regard him as an inside centre			1
the 26 - year - old 's slow progress since departing the @entity28 has led to speculation he may return to league , but @entity47 is among those who believe he can still win a place in @entity36 's @entity50 squad			0
@entity0 ' elevation to the starting xv is one of eight changes made to the team dumped out of the @entity31 by an 18 - 15 quarter - final defeat to @entity33 in @entity57			0
@entity0 was called into @entity59 's @entity36 squad during the @entity35 @entity61 flanker @entity60 leads the side as regular skipper @entity63 has a calf injury , while @entity65 is restored to the right wing			0
victory over @entity7 at @entity16 would strengthen @entity2 's claim to home advantage in the @entity15 play - offs and lift them up to second place , albeit temporarily if @entity74 defeat @entity72			1
@entity7 have replaced @entity75 with @entity76 as one of four changes as they seek to make inroads into the seven - point gap separating them from @entity81 in 10th place			0
@entity36 winger @entity65 ( left ) returns to the @entity2 startling line - up against @entity7			2

@entity2 face @entity7 in the @entity15 on friday night
@entity0 has played *predominately* at centre so far for @entity2
but the former rugby league superstar will line up at flanker on friday
