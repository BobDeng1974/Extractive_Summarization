the move is part of a wider crackdown in @entity21 and across @entity22 targeting retailers and manufacturers selling food which is not what it claims to be on the label			0
the issue of fake and counterfeit food has leapt to the top of the political agenda following the horsemeat scandal of a year ago where horse was passed off as beef			1
olive oil is among a number of premium food products which has been particularly susceptible to fakery , however it is unusual for a store like @entity2 to be caught out			1

@entity3 government officials then visited @entity57 , bought a bottle and submitted a report to the officials at the food and farming department @entity61 , which is responsible for policing food authenticity			1
it appears that the olive oil may well have originated in @entity5 , however it is not allowed to be labelled as @entity5 olive oil unless the whole manufacturing process , including growing , pressing and bottling , happens in the region			1
@entity71 , the inspector who uncovered the false @entity5 olive oil , said : ' labels like that suggest the product 's @entity75 but it was bottled in the @entity21 , as in fact it said on the label , and this contravenes the product protocol laid down by the @entity80 '			1
