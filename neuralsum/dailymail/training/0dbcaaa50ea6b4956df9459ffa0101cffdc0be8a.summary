by @entity0 @entity1 admits the boardroom ‘ silence is deafening ’ at @entity4 and fears he will be ousted from his job in the summer			1
chairman @entity7 was not at @entity8 on saturday to see @entity4 crashing to a 4 - 0 defeat which damaged their chances of returning to the @entity11 , which seems to be @entity1 ’s best way of somehow avoiding the axe			1
@entity7 has made no attempt to refute the popular theory that @entity17 boss @entity16 is primed to take over after the @entity18 and , caught up in the emotion of losing heavily , @entity1 said : ‘ the silence is deafening , is n’t it ? it ’s up to @entity7			1
i did n’t know if he was at the game or not			2
i want the team to do very well and it hurts me when they do n’t			2
i ’m afraid i need people in that dressing room to be hurting like i am			2
’ @entity1 was appointed in december to replace @entity41 and handed his first chance to manage at senior level with an 18 - month contract , but appears resigned to becoming the eighth manager sacked by @entity7 in 13 years			1
sporting director @entity47 ’s future also appears in jeopardy after @entity4 lured former chief scout @entity49 back to the club by hijacking a proposed switch from @entity53 ’s scouting team to @entity54 ’s			1
@entity4 insist @entity47 , who arrived only last year , and @entity55 will work in tandem but @entity7 seems determined to restructure again behind the scenes at @entity58			1
@entity1 is understood to have not been consulted about @entity49 ’s return			1
despite his inexperience , @entity1 has made it clear he has no desire to work as assistant to a new manager but hinted for the first time that he may be interested in a technical director ’s role , a more powerful version of his previous position as technical coordinator with added responsibility for strategy through the club			1
‘ i feel i can do the @entity75 job but i ’d be no good as a @entity76 , i ’m too opinionated			2
i would n’t want to do the job , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ there is a place for a technical director , someone who sees the club from bottom to top of the training field			2
there ’s a definite place for that , otherwise you get no continuity and end up buying seven or 10 players every window and your turnover of players is too great			2
’ @entity8 players know how to win matches			1
there have been plenty of dives this season , the clearest from @entity99 to preserve the @entity100 ’ unbeaten home record , against @entity102			2
others @entity104 has admitted but still benefited from			2
on saturday evening , @entity105 did n’t dive but played very cleverly for the decisive penalty , which @entity108 awarded after 59 minutes at @entity26			1
@entity105 gets ahead of defenders and then slows his stride to draw contact			2
this time , it was a small push from @entity113 , which replays just about found			0
it was a soft penalty but not a wrong one from @entity108			0
he did very well to detect contact at full speed			0
however , he then decided @entity113 had denied an obvious goalscoring chance , so he dismissed him			0
as @entity105 did not have control of the ball and was not heading directly towards goal , i do n’t agree with the red			0
@entity4 could well have the card overturned			1
not enough leaders : @entity1 casts an evil eye at midfielder @entity128 at the end of the game the win against @entity4 extended @entity104 ’s unbeaten record in the @entity33 at @entity26 to 75 games			1
he has won 193 points from a possible 225			0
if there is friction behind the scenes , there was also friction on the touchline at @entity26 , where @entity1 clashed angrily with @entity8 coach @entity17			1
‘ i thought his comments were a little bit patronising , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i ’m not sure what he actually said , and to be honest i was in that kind of mood to blow up with anyone so no hard feelings			0
’ the @entity4 boss was also unable to mask his feelings about his own players after what he described as another ‘ gutless ’ disintegration to go with 6 - 0 and 5 - 1 defeats against @entity155 and a 5 - 0 defeat at home to @entity158			1
‘ we lack something do n’t we ? ’ said @entity1 when asked about his on - field leaders			1
‘ @entity162 are happening too often			0
‘ in adversity , when things go against us , that ’s when we go missing			0
you either have that in you or you have n’t			0
we need to stand up and be counted sooner rather than later			0
’ spurs performed well for 56 minutes until @entity169 ’s mistake gifted @entity105 the first			0
@entity113 was sent off after conceding a penalty for @entity8 ’s second and captain @entity173 pulled a hamstring and limped off			1
defensive problems loom ahead of sunday ’s @entity176			0
@entity173 , @entity177 and @entity178 , who can play at the back , are injured and @entity113 will be banned			0
the only senior centre - half available is @entity181 , who says he wants out if @entity4 do not make the @entity11 and was responsible for sparking saturday ’s collapse and culpable in the third scored by @entity184			1
despondent : @entity185 refused pushed @entity187 's hand away after the final whistle team spirit ? the players were accused of not caring as much as their passionate boss at the end , few @entity4 players acknowledged their supporters and when coach @entity195 tried to usher @entity185 towards them , @entity185 pushed @entity187 ’s arm away and stormed down the tunnel			1
‘ they should walk down there , ’ said @entity1			1
’ i told them to go down there			0
you can understand their disappointment but those fans are disappointed too and those fans are second to none			0
it ’s important our players acknowledge them			2
’ @entity104 defended @entity105 against accusations that he played to win @entity8 ’s penalty and insisted football ’s divers were not to be found at @entity26			1
the @entity8 manager did not name @entity217 but there was a sly dig involved as he tackled the subject of deliberately trying to get opposing goalkeepers sent off			2
‘ we had big opportunity in the second minute of the game when other players with other shirts the players would go for a penalty and a red card for the keeper , ’ said the @entity8 boss			1
‘ @entity231 does n’t do that and he misses from a difficult angle			0
he tries to go away from the keeper , while other important players in this league they attack the keeper			2
. ‘ you know the kings of the penalites , ’ said @entity104			0
‘ you know where they are and they ’re not here			0
’ easy : @entity8 ran riot on saturday instead , the @entity8 boss praised the predatory instincts of @entity105 , who is 33 today , ( @entity248 ) ‘ @entity105 was brilliant , ’ said @entity104			1
‘ you can speak about @entity181 ’s mistake but it was only @entity181 ’s mistake because @entity105 is there			0
if @entity105 does not read the situation the defender or the goalkeeper will get the ball			0
‘ he ’s not a 20 years old super-fast player like he was 10 years ago , so he needs to be close to the goal , he needs his feet in the box and he ’s very intelligent in the way he moves			0
@entity105 started against @entity4 only because @entity263 was injured in the warm - up and is likely to miss at least two weeks as @entity8 sprint clear in the title race and attempt to reach the last eight of the @entity11			1
@entity104 believes the @entity11 will play a part in the title race , but believes both @entity155 and @entity270 can overturn their first leg defeats in @entity272			0
‘ they lost at home , but ca n’t @entity155 win in @entity277 ? ’ said the @entity8 manager			2
‘ no ? @entity277 lost to @entity278 and lost at home to @entity280			0
why ca n’t they win ? why ca n’t @entity270 change that result against @entity282 ? i think they can			0
i think they ’re going through			0
@entity54 at @entity283 , can they win 2 - 0 and go to extra time ? difficult , probably the most difficult of the three but they can			1

@entity1 *slammed* his @entity4 team after the 4 - 0 defeat to @entity8
he says the silence from chairman @entity7 is ' deafening '
@entity16 is *reportedly* being lined up as a new boss in the summer
