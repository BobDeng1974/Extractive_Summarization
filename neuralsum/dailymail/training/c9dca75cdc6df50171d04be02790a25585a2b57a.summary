by @entity0 published : 20:18 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 21 july 2013 amid the widespread fury and indignation sparked by @entity4 's murder acquittal , a 1973 photo of black and white kids embracing on a rain - soaked @entity8 street has struck a chord with @entity10 , instantly becoming a viral sensation			1
the now - iconic image was captured by @entity13 , a photographer working in the 70s for @entity14			1
the black - and - white photo taken on a summer day in 1973 depicts five kids - three of them @entity18 and two of them white - happily posing for the camera in the middle of the street in the suburb of @entity23			1
moment of unity : in july 1973 , @entity13 was wandering the streets of @entity23 , @entity27 , when he came across ( left to right ) @entity28 , 3 , @entity29 , 7 , @entity30 , 5 , @entity31 , 9 , and @entity32 , 6 four of the older kids are seen embracing , while the smallest of the group , a 3 - year - old girl , is standing next to them , nearly obscured by a too - big shopping cart			1
last sunday , just days after the controversial verdict clearing @entity4 in the 2011 killing of black unarmed teenager @entity42 , the 63 - year - old photographer dug up the old picture of the grinning children and posted it on his @entity46 account , hoping to bring something positive to the heated debate over race relations			0
serendipity : @entity13 ( pictured ) shot a few frames of the grinning and embracing kids at their request , and he came to cherish the image as one of the most meaningful in his life ' for me , it still stands as one of my most meaningful pictures , ’ he wrote in his post			2
‘ it makes me wonder ... at what point do we begin to mistrust one another ? when do we begin to judge one another based on gender or race ? i have always wondered what happened to these children			0
i wonder if they are still friends			0
’ the photo showing a brief moment of racial harmony amid a firestorm of anger and hatred instantly went viral			0
on friday , @entity13 wrote on his @entity46 page that the vintage picture has drawn 769,000 views			2
by saturday evening , the image has attracted nearly 19,000 ‘ likes ’ and just under 10,500 comments			0
the @entity14 reprinted the photo on its homepage and sent someone to the archives to track down the microfilm in order to identify the kids , whose names were written in the caption			2
the subjects , who are now middle - aged , have been identified as two sets of siblings : @entity28 , 3 , @entity30 , 5 , and @entity32 , 6 , and their friends , 7 - year - old @entity29 and her 9 - year - old brother , @entity97			1
like most truly great things in life , the encounter between @entity13 and the siblings was a case of pure serendipity			2
on the afternoon of july 31 , 1973 , the photographer was on assignment in @entity106 trying to find a subject for a ' slice of life ' essay for the paper			1
in his sunday post that accompanied the vintage photos , the 63 - year - old @entity13 , who now lives in @entity113 , explained that he was walking down @entity114 when he spotted some neighborhood kids at play			1
march of time : forty years later , @entity28 , pictured left with her daughter , @entity118 , still lives in @entity23 , along with her sister , @entity119 ' they saw me and said , " hey mister , take our picture ! " he wrote			1
‘ the pose was completely spontaneous			0
’ @entity13 shot several frames , one of which was later published inside the paper and forgotten by most			2
but for the photographer , seeing the kids embracing one another without giving the color of their skin a second thought made him wonder : when is innocence lost ? ‘ at what point do we begin to mistrust one another ? when do we begin to judge one another based on gender or race ? ’ he later wondered on @entity46			2
following the heated debate over the @entity4 verdict and seeing images of angry protesters demonstrating from coast to coast made the 63 - year - old retiree think about the old photo of the kids and share it with the world , he told @entity153			0
and now it appears that a reunion between @entity13 and his young friends may be in order			0
in his original post , @entity13 wondered if the children he had depicted were still friends , and what had become of them			0
less than a week later , he started getting answers to his questions			0
on wednesday , the retiree emailed deadline @entity8 , saying that he got a call from @entity166 , the college student daughter of @entity28 – the little girl barely visible behind the shopping cart in the vintage print			1
watershed moment : @entity13 was inspired to share the vintage photo with the world after @entity4 ( left ) was acquitted of shooting dead @entity42 , a black unarmed teen ( right ) public fury : protesters rally in @entity175 on july 20 , 2013 to express anger over a not - guilty verdict in the shooting death of @entity42 and call for an end to the @entity181 self - defense laws positive message : amid widespread indignation and outrage , @entity13 's snapshot of racial harmony has struck a chord ms @entity30 , who attends school in @entity189 , told the photographer that her mom was shocked to see her 3 - year - old self staring back at her from a page in the morning paper			1
‘ she seemed genuinely moved by the spirit of the picture , ’ @entity13 said of @entity118			0
