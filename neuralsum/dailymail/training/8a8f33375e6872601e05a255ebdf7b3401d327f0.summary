by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 07:53 est , 23 july 2012 set to get slimmer : the latest @entity2 gadget will feature ' in - cell technology ' which has touch sensors in the screen instead of another layer on top as it is now a factory in @entity9 has begun production of components for @entity2 's eagerly awaited @entity12 , expected to go on sale this autumn			1
@entity14 - one of @entity2 's normal suppliers - has begun production of the new phone already , according to a report in @entity19			1
the manufacturer will also be working on a smaller @entity21 later in the year			0
details of the upcoming handset are scant , although it is expected to have a larger screen than the current @entity12			1
the new @entity12 will have an even thinner screen thanks to advances in lcd manufacturing , according to reports			2
the latest @entity2 gadget will feature ‘ in - cell technology ’ which has touch sensors in the screen instead of another layer on top as it is now			1
further sources in @entity2 's supply chain confirmed that the tech giant will drop the wide dock connector used in the company 's gadgets for the best part of a decade in favour of a smaller one , a change likely to annoy the @entity2 faithful but which could be a boon for accessory makers			1
the iphone 5 , @entity2 's next generation @entity12 expected to go on sale around october , will come with a 19 - pin connector port at the bottom instead of the proprietary 30 - pin port ‘ to make room for the earphone moving to the bottom ’ , two sources familiar with the matter told @entity59			1
that would mean the new phone would not connect with the myriad of accessories such as speakers and power chargers that form part of the ecosystem around @entity68 , @entity21 and @entity69 , without an adaptor			0
that means new business , analysts say			0
‘ it represents an opportunity for accessory vendors , ’ said @entity74 , @entity75 - based analyst at technology research firm @entity76			0
‘ the @entity12 connector has been a standard for a long time now and i would expect the same to be true for a new connector , should @entity2 change it as expected			1
’ @entity2 did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment			2
it 's coming ! @entity85 has released this image , purported to be the @entity12			2
features that can be spotted include a much larger screen , and a smaller dock connector tech blogs have long speculated on the demise of the 30 - pin connector , which at 21 mm wide takes up a chunk of space , especially as the latest technologies such as @entity96 offer more power in less space			2
they say that a smaller connector would give @entity2 more scope for new product designs or a bigger battery , or simply to make ever smaller products			1
@entity106 's @entity105 , one of the biggest makers of @entity2 speakers , declined to comment			1
but some enterprising vendors in @entity111 have already begun offering cases for the new phone , complete with earphone socket on the bottom and a ‘ guarantee ’ the dimensions are correct			0
for some in the peripherals industry , the change could open doors to new business			0
‘ @entity68 docking speaker sales have been declining for one or two years , ’ said an employee of a @entity125 - based company that designs speakers especially for @entity2 products			2
‘ my previous factory is a lucky one			0
they shifted the focus to @entity136 speakers , which proved a wise decision now , ’ the employee said , speaking on condition of anonymity			0
‘ it looks like while @entity68 speaker sales are going down , @entity136 speaker sales are going up			0
’ @entity141 printed these images of what they claim is the fascia of the next @entity12 , suggesting the screen is much larger			0
