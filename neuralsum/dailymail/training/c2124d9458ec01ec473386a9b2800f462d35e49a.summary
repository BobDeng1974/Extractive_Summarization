by @entity0 a disgraced @entity2 pharmacist sentenced to 30 months of house arrest for his role in a large - scale pill mill operation has requested to have his sentence cut short saying that at 551lbs , he is already confined to his home			1
@entity9 district judge @entity8 on monday rejected the plea submitted by 70 - year - old @entity11 , writing in his opinion that the painkiller - pushing pharmacist had been spared prison time only because it would have proven too difficult to care for him in a correctional facility			2
@entity11 , of @entity16 , was sentenced in august 2012 for distributing more than a million prescription pain medications like oxycodone to clinics operated by the twins @entity21 and @entity22			1
heavy burden : former @entity2 pharmacist @entity11 , 70 , pictured in august 2012 around the time he pleaded guilty in a mill pill case , has asked a judge to reduce his 30 - month house arrest sentence saying he is too big to go outside the siblings are currently serving prison terms of more than a dozen years each for flooding several cities in @entity2 with illegal pain drugs			1
judge @entity8 said during @entity11 's sentencing two years ago that the @entity2 prison system can not accommodate someone so large , @entity31 reported			2
weighing more than a quarter of a ton , mr @entity11 gets around in a wheelchair , can not dress himself or bathe without assistance , and there are no beds in penitentiaries that could support his bulk			0
@entity11 's lawyer , @entity42 , described his client 's house arrest as ' both unnecessary and futile ' because his weight problem and poor health already confine him to his bedroom			1
in his request for a reduced sentence , the attorney argued that the 70 - year - old man has a wide array of grave medical issues , including heart disease , an incurable lymph condition and sleep apnea , which would likely end his life in the next six to 12 months			0
' each day may be one of his last , ' @entity42 wrote in his 10 - page plea			0
the lawyer also pointed out that @entity11 can not fit in a car and suffers from an acute fear of falling that effectively confines him to his home			1
since his sentencing , the ailing 550 - pound man has remained largely indoors			0
he did , however , venture outside to attend his own wedding ceremony when he married @entity67			0
@entity42 asked judge @entity8 to shave the last seven months off his client 's sentence so that he could visit friends and family in @entity72 to say goodbye			0
double trouble : @entity74 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) @entity22 are currently serving 14 years and more than 15 years in prison , respectively , for operating illegal pain management clinics but the judge seized upon the lawyer 's argument , questioning how the largely immobile , morbidly obese man who has a fear of falling and can not fit into a car would be able to journey from @entity2 to @entity84 for a family reunion			1
@entity11 was one of about 32 people indicted in 2012 as part of ' @entity88			2
' according to prosecutors , the @entity22 brothers operated and managed four pain management clinics , which distributed about 20million oxycodone pills over the course of two years to the tune of $ 40million in profits			1
the indictment stated that the twins hired doctors who agreed to write prescriptions for controlled substances without any regard for medical necessity			0
in january 2012 , @entity103 , then 31 years old , was sentenced to 15 - and - a - half years in federal prison after pleading guilty to racketeering conspiracy			2
his brother , @entity74 , also pleaded guilty to racketeering and is now serving a 14 - year sentence .			0
