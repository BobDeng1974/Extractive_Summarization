viewers have complained that @entity6 , which first aired more than 30 years ago , features hardly any of the actual sport and lots of presenters ‘ chatting ’ instead			1
the @entity11 series presented by @entity12 , who competed at five @entity13 , and @entity14 on sunday nights is a far cry from the series that first aired in 1978 , which concentrated on the competitive events			2
@entity6 presenters @entity12 and @entity14			2
viewers have complained that the revamped show is too far from the original it now includes other sports such as mountain climbing and speed skating and discussions as well as segments about other winter sports			1
