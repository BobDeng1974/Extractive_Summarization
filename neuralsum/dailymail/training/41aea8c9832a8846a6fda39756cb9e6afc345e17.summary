by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 21 april 2012 updated : 12:26 est , 21 april 2012 the man who set out to conquer @entity2 with a nine - foot cuddly tiger strapped to his back has reached the highest peak in @entity6			1
@entity7 hauled the 30lb beast to an altitude of 19,341ft - just a few days after the two of them completed last sunday 's @entity13 marathon			1
and as if that were n't enough , the 49 - year - old is now preparing to carry his feline friend across the finish line in the @entity19 marathon tomorrow			1
top cat : an overjoyed @entity7 celebrates reaching the @entity22 peak of @entity2 having made the ascent with a nine - foot cuddly tiger on his back earning his stripes : mr @entity7 and his furry friend had to battle through snow and harsh conditions to summit the highest point in @entity6 mr @entity7 , a wildlife photographer and tour guide from @entity32 , battled through heavy snow in the final stretch towards the @entity2			1
his trio of gruelling feats forms a fundraising campaign to help save central @entity39 's bengal tiger population			0
after a long descent on thursday , he said : ' @entity41 is a sub species - however , yesterday some of that cold - weather tiger 's dna was in evidence on @entity2			0
in the worst conditions that anybody had ever experienced , the tiger summited			0
' he was due to fly back from @entity6 today to tackle the final stage of his three - part charity challenge			1
with his @entity54 campaign , mr @entity7 is hoping to raise more than £ 25,000 for @entity55 , a charity which works with communities around the world to protect endangered species and habitats			1
roaring success : the hardy fundraiser passes above the clouds on his way to an altitude of more than 19,000ft mr @entity7 , who ran four marathons in one week two years ago , had to complete the @entity13 race in less than six - and - a - half hours to catch his flight to @entity6			1
having crossed the line after less than six hours last sunday , he was whisked to @entity69 , where he jetted off to @entity70 to begin the five - day ascent of the world 's highest free - standing mountain			1
the proceeds will go towards conservation projects in @entity39 's @entity76			0
mr @entity7 said hunters poach tigers for medicine and to profit from sales of their fur , teeth and claws , while the species is also losing its natural habitat due to industry destroying the forests where they live			2
tough going : @entity7 at the beginning of his ascent of @entity2 in @entity70 with a 30lb tiger on his back checking in : the tiger and mr @entity7 board the @entity95 flight from @entity69 to @entity96 he said : ' using tigers in traditional medicine is sheer lunacy			2
it has no value in any shape or form			0
' @entity104 could become extinct , but if we act now these beautiful animals are a species that can definitely be saved			0
' while there were around 100,000 tigers in the wild a century ago , their numbers have plummeted due to poaching and loss of habitat and there are now thought to be as few as 3,500 left			0
one of the most important aspects of the charity 's work is to educate local people about the plight of endangered animals and to stop predators such as tigers simply being seen as the enemy			2
mr @entity7 has raised £ 80,000 for the cause previously , and all the money raised in his latest challenge will go towards a compensation war chest for local farmers who have lost cattle to the big cats			0
the value of a dead tiger is around £ 12,000 , according to the charity , but the value of a living tigress has been calculated as £ 70 million in the revenue it will bring to a reserve or park such as @entity76			0
getting comfortable : the tiger and @entity7 settle down on thhe @entity95 flight to @entity96 in preparation for the gruelling effort to come mounting up : mr @entity7 makes for a bizarre sight as he arrives at @entity145 , @entity96 with a tiger on his back on the move : the enormous @entity2 looms on the horizon as the plucky fundraiser strides off with his nine - foot tiger on his back			2
