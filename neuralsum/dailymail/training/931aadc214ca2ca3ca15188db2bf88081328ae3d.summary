so you are at the airport waiting excitedly to board the plane and jet off on your holidays			0
but suddenly the departure board is showing that your flight is delayed			2
worse still , it then changes to read ' cancelled '			0
do n't just groan and put up with it			0
under @entity11 law , in many circumstances airlines have to provide passengers with food , drink and , in the case of a long delay , accommodation , plus compensation			1
but all too often , airlines are unforthcoming about your rights – so it really pays to know what they are			2
this six point guide should help			0
read the signs : passengers have more rights than they often appreciate when it comes to air travel 1			1
get familiar with @entity30 261/2004 it sounds dull as ditch - water , and wo n't be trending on @entity33 any time soon			0
but this is the key piece of @entity11 law that covers passengers ' rights when flying			1
having some understanding of it may deliver you anything from a free meal to a payout of hundreds of pounds			0
if your flight is cancelled or delayed by at least two hours , then , under @entity11 rules , airlines must provide - at the airport - a written summary setting out the rules for assistance and / or compensation			1
however , this does not always happen			0
whether or not the airline tells you about your rights , do also look on the @entity57 's website ( www.caa.co.uk )			2
in the @entity60 section , under @entity58 , you will find chapter and verse about your rights when facing a delay or cancellation			2
important note : the regulation does not apply to any flight you might make			2
it covers those departing from airports in the @entity11 irrespective of the airline ( so all @entity73 flights ) , and flights to @entity11 airports which are operated by @entity11 - based airlines			1
although @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 are not in the @entity11 , the rules apply to them too			1
do n't take it lying down : all flights departing from @entity11 airports are covered by @entity83 legislation 2			1
you may be entitled to assistance depending on the length of your delay and flight , airlines have to provide - for free - means of communication ( eg phone calls ) , a reasonable amount to eat and drink ( usually covered in the form of vouchers ) , and , for overnight delays , hotel accommodation and airport - hotel transfers			1
these rights kick in when the delay is over two hours on short - haul flights up to 1,500km , more than three hours on flights 1,500km - 3,500km , and over four hours on longer flights			1
crucially , airlines must provide this help whatever the cause of the delay			0
if your airline does not cough up and you incurred costs , keep the receipts , and contact the airline later to make a claim			0
you may also be entitled to compensation ... ... but only if the flight arrives at least three hours late , or it was cancelled , and the airline was at fault			1
however , there is a sizeable catch			0
if the airline can prove that ' extraordinary circumstances ' beyond its control were at play , such as as bad weather , air traffic control problems or security issues , then it does not have to cough up			2
a technical problem with the aircraft can also fall under ' extraordinary circumstances ' - but not if it should have been picked up by routine maintenance			0
compensation amounts are fixed – from € 250 ( around £ 210 ) to € 600 ( £ 504 ) per person – and determined by the length of flight and delay			1
importantly , you can claim for a delayed or cancelled flight that you took in past years ( in theory back to as long ago as 2005 )			0
somewhere to turn ? flights outside the @entity11 are less protected - but passengers still have considerable rights 4			1
watch out for changes to @entity11 rules in june , the @entity146 may refine some of the rules			1
it is likely that compensation only will apply for short - haul flights delayed by a minimum of five hours , or nine or 12 hours on longer journeys			1
on a more positive note , passengers ' rights when stuck sweltering in a plane going nowhere on the tarmac look set to improve			2
your rights on flights not covered by the @entity11 regulation are much more limited usually , you will be at the mercy of the terms of your contract with the airline			1
if you are flying with a reputable airline , you can expect refreshments and hotel accommodation when severely delayed , but compensation is very unlikely			0
your travel insurance is likely to give some cover for long flight delays , but amounts are small : typically £ 25 - £ 50 for a delay of over 12 hours			2
consider getting help to enforce your rights recent clarifications about the @entity11 rules and what constitutes ' extraordinary circumstances ' have meant that more passengers are receiving the compensation they are entitled to			1
however , many airlines will often try their utmost to avoid paying up , so you need to be prepared for a battle			0
first step is to put in a claim against the airline			0
the @entity57 's website ( www.caa.co.uk ) has detailed information on how best to go about making a claim , and has a template claims letter that you can download and send			0
if you get nowhere with the airline , the @entity57 may be able to look in to your case .			0

passengers have more rights than they know when it comes to air travel
all flights departing from within the @entity11 are covered by @entity83 legislation
levels of possible compensation vary according to the length of the flight
