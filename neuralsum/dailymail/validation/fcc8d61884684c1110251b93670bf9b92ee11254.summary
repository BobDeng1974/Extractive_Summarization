anyone who 's been on a ski holiday will admit to have thinking it			0
' would n't this place be brilliant if we had it all to ourselves ? ' one way to avoid crowds on the slopes , is to hire out the whole resort exclusively - something one @entity11 ski village offers for $ 10,000			1
@entity13 , in @entity11 , can host 200 people at its resort and while its slopes are open to the public from thursday to sunday , from monday to wednesday , skiers will have the lifts and the runs to themselves			1
@entity13 in @entity11 can be hired out completely for almost $ 10,000 ( £ 6,500 ) and can cater for 200 people and while it sounds like the sort of thing that would only be exclusively accessed by the rich , royal or uber - famous , it 's not			1
in theory , the whole place including accommodation and slopes with five lifts to access 600 acres of skiable powder , can be all yours for $ 50 ( £ 32.50 )			1
owner @entity30 , a former banker , rents out the whole resort privately for $ 10,000 ( £ 6,486 ) , which if split between 200 people works out at just $ 50 ( £ 32.50 ) each			1
and because it 's called the @entity33 ' , and the resort is run privately and not by some big , faceless corporation , it 's all tailored to your group 's needs			1
speaking to @entity39 , mr @entity30 says that three key virtues of an authentic ski and snowboard experience , affordable first class food service and a terrain for all levels make the resort what it is			1
the @entity50 resort offers stunning views out over @entity11 , while this luxury continues to the facilities and food on offer executive chef @entity56 ensures his food and his staff are of the highest standard for all the guests ' @entity13 resembles a ski resort of the classic era before high speed detachable lifts , luxury shopping villages and amusement park - like crowds and lines			1
guests have the space to enjoy the snow and the mountains without fighting crowds			0
as a private , family - run operation , the culture of @entity13 and its staff is set from the top			1
our goal is simple : we want you to have an amazing time at our resort			0
you will find the friendliest and most helpful staff in the resort industry			0
' from the personal escort to your condo at check - in , to the special attention to your kids in our ski school program , you will be treated like a special guest at our resort			2
' most of the lodging is ski - in / ski - out and located within a short walk through the fresh powder from the main lodge			2
what better thing can there be after a testing day on the slopes than relaxing in the bar with friends and an alcoholic beverage ? the resort caters for all levels of skier , and has the facilities to provide for all the family ' @entity13 is offering the opportunity to reserve the entire resort on an exclusive basis , ' says the resort website			2
' imagine you and your friends , family , social or corporate group , enjoying exclusive access to 600 skiable acres , five lifts , the terrain park - and of course no lift lines ! ' stay in comfortable accommodations , with superb dining options and plenty of apres ski fun for everyone - all tailored to your group 's priorities and interests			1
' this is your chance to be king of the mountain			0
' the resort can be booked privately from monday through until wednesday , and could cost you just £ 35 clearly the package is most attractive to corporate groups and its convenient position 241 miles or a less than four - hour drive from @entity141 does n't hurt at all			2
by comparison , the much more famous @entity143 in @entity144 is a three hours and 15 minute flight away			0
the @entity147 which includes @entity149 restaurant dishing up @entity50 cuisine for breakfast , lunch and dinner and a bar , two fireplaces , and five televisions			2
the @entity157 is also the hub at night - time with live music and dancing guaranteed on saturdays with a host of acts coming over from @entity141			2
the accommodation is a step back in time to what we 'd consider a classic ski resort , with a village feel and an array of suites , condos , cottages and holiday homes , along with lodgings in @entity175 , a @entity176 - settled town of about 2,500 people			1
the heavy snowfall has mean @entity13 has maintained a steady influx of customers to its slopes the region boasts 40 feet of snow annually , and famously fun powder at that			2
although this year has n't been a good one for @entity13 , it 's turned around in the past week			0
after a brief closure in february it was planned that from february 21 the slopes would only be open on weekends due to a lack of snow fall and warm weather			0
however @entity194 delivered and from yesterday regular service as resumed , albeit with a very generous free skiing for all on sundays , as long as you sign up to the mailing list			0
the resort will cater for skiers as well as snowboarders and can provide all the equipment to make your stay memorable mr @entity30 added : ' while not as large as the mega resorts of @entity144 and @entity11 , @entity13 has 600 acres of terrain that will suit all levels			1
' our steep terrain is the most thrilling in the region and rivals the same at any of the mega resorts			0
the groomers will keep the casual skiers and snowboarders smiling and shushing throughout their stay			0
' also , the resort is situated like two resorts - divided by skill level - with all of the steep terrain and one side and the groomers on another			0
this allows a clustering of like - skilled skiers and snowboarders together			0
