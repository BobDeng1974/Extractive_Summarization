@entity1 's captain @entity0 runs the rule over some horses that could shine in the coming weeks			2
@entity4 ( trained by @entity5 ) runners from @entity7 do n’t figure very often in this column but this one was such an easy winner when well backed on saturday that he must be mentioned			1
has done the rounds in @entity12 , most recently with @entity15 trainer @entity13			0
his handicap mark has plummeted and even allowing for the hike his easy win will prompt , he will still probably be on a fair mark			0
he likes soft ground but you may have to wait for his next run – the 2015 @entity7 @entity24 has been mentioned as a target			2
@entity4 , pictured here ahead of the @entity26 , was a strong winner on saturday @entity28 ( trained by @entity29 ) included on this list but with a large question mark after his fourth place to @entity34 at @entity35 on saturday			1
this gelding still has a long way to go to live up to his top - notch bumper form and he pulled far too hard to have any hope of realistically seeing out his race			0
but on the positive side , @entity43 was not hard on his mount and there remains a suspicion that a big handicap prize could ultimately come his way			0
question marks still hang over @entity43 mount @entity50 ( right ) but a major handicap prize in on the cards @entity53 ( trained by @entity54 ) there was a positive word for this son of @entity58 , which carries the colours of the @entity60 , ahead of his debut at @entity62			2
he travelled well before being tapped for toe running into the dip			0
jockey @entity65 never even thought about going for his whip as the colt came home in sixth place			0
he has the size and scope to do better next year			1
@entity72 ( trained by @entity73 ) @entity73 was bemoaning the early entry system for some of our big two - year - old races after this colt won the @entity79 at @entity62 , suggesting if he had been able to make a later decision , @entity80 might have lined up in the @entity82			1
that indicates he likes this colt and a shot at a @entity87 trial next year is on the cards			1
@entity73 - trained colt @entity80 races to victory in the @entity79 at @entity62			1

@entity7 's @entity4 was an easy winner at @entity94 on saturday
@entity50 has *potential* despite a fourth place to @entity34 at @entity35
pick your choice has the size and scope to improve next year
@entity73 could aim at next year 's @entity87 trial with @entity80
