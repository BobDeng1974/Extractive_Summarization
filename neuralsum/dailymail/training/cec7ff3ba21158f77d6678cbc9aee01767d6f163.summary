a group of pranksters ' comedy ' gangsta ' sketch went horribly wrong after police mistook their toy guns for real ones			1
the four men had been filming a stunt in @entity10 , @entity11 , for their @entity13 and @entity14 pages which involved two of the group brandishing the fake guns before holding them to their friend 's neck			1
but the joke quickly backfired after a member of the public mistook the toys for real weapons and reported them to police			1
the camera was still rolling when armed officers arrive shouting at them to ' drop the gun , drop the gun			1
' the group of pranksters hold the fake guns to their friend 's neck as part of their comedy ' gangsta ' stunt but the sketch quickly becomes very real for the four men after police are called and order them to lie on the ground and surrender their weapons the friends attempt to explain they are filming and the guns were fake but the officer forces them to lie down on the ground and surrender their weapons			1
he can then be heard reporting to a back up team saying : ' four recovered - at least two firearms			0
' police confirmed that armed officers had attended and arrested the group who were later released without charge			1
the three minute clip has now been viewed almost 300,000 times since it was added on november 30			0
one of the stunt men , who posted the clip on @entity14 on november 30 , wrote : '' we was filming a short sketch for my @entity61 page , using plastic toy guns as props			1
a member of public must of saw us and called the police			1
the video has split opinion online over the police 's response			2
@entity72 wrote on the @entity14 video 's comments : ' that was excessive			0
they dropped their guns as soon as they were asked to and everyone but the cameraman got on the floor when asked			2
' there was no need for the language either			0
all it would have taken was a quick check once they 'd been handcuffed and it would have been so much less violent			0
but then it 's understandable for the police to be scared since they do n't have guns			1
' but @entity91 added that : ' guns are n't toys			2
' @entity14 user @entity94 wrote : ' in @entity96 they would of got shot with no question asked lol			0
' @entity98 added : ' in the cops defense ... if they treated every situation with exposed firearms as ' they 're probably just filming ' , we 'd have a lot of dead people on our hands			0
so i 'm glad they took the ' better safe than sorry ' route			0
especially with all the stuff going on over in the states			0
' we should have been more responsible			0
definitely pooped myself a bit tho haha ! ' let this a lesson to everyone , do n't play with plastic guns in public			1
possession of imitation and toy firearms can in certain circumstances amount to a criminal offence			2
the four men , all in their late twenties and early thirties , were arrested on november 29 at around 2pm			2
another member of the group posted on @entity61 : ' what a mad day ... ca n't lie tho i was shook and fully nearly lost my life if i held the gun any longer i was a goner			1
' all for me and my boys filmin a robbery sketch for @entity137			2
' ( sic ) a spokeswoman for @entity139 said without officers knowing if the guns were real or fake they had to follow protocol			2
' four men aged 27 , 28 , 30 and 30 were arrested at the scene and taken to an east @entity11 police station , ' she added			1
' two imitation firearms were recovered at the scene			0
' all suspects were interviewed and provided the same account			0
they explained that they were using the imitation guns to make a film			0
' the suspects showed remorse and were later released with no further action being taken			0
