by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 06:28 est , 17 may 2013 energy giants will be forced to compensate customers if they are mis - sold products , under a crackdown on rogue selling			1
new powers will be handed to the regulator not only to fine firms which dupe consumers , but to force suppliers to reimburse them and provide compensation			1
it has been hailed as a victory for the consumer following a series of price - fixing scandals by the @entity18 energy firms which have left tens of thousands of householders out of pocket			1
big energy firms who mis - sell products to customers will have to compensation for the first time last month , @entity27 , the @entity28 ’s second largest energy supplier , was fined a record £ 10.5million by @entity29 for ‘ prolonged and extensive ’ mis - selling which affected up to 23,000 customers			1
but while thousands of compensation claims have been lodged , it is unclear how many will be successful and whether they will be paid back in full			0
government sources said this new power , to be included in next month ’s @entity37 , would give the regulator the ‘ teeth ’ they need to force firms to give redress to victims			1
@entity44 , executive director at consumer group which ? said : ‘ mis - selling is totally unacceptable whether in energy , banking or any other industry that people rely on			1
‘ a series of scandals have ruined consumer confidence in energy , and our latest research shows that less than a quarter of people say they trust suppliers			1
this change ca n't come a minute too soon for fed up and cash strapped consumers			0
’ @entity64 , policy director at @entity65 said : ‘ it ’s a victory for the consumer			2
mis - selling has been a stain on the energy market since the introduction of competition			1
‘ while the situation has got better , the recent history casts a long shadow			0
we fully supports @entity29 getting greater powers to benefit customers rather than the exchequer when issuing fines ’			2
the proposed new law is intended to radically simplify the energy market , after @entity81 said the number of different energy plans and tariffs on offer was ‘ bewildering ’ for consumers			2
more than eight out of ten customers pay too much for their energy because they are not aware of the cheapest tariff , according to the @entity91			2
consumer groups backed the move to help people with their energy bills it is expected to force each firm to offer only a handful of different tariffs ; make it clear to customers if they could save money on a cheaper plan , and offer easier options for switching such as via smartphones and ‘ collective switching ’ websites where thousands of people can put pressure on their suppliers to reduce their prices			1
millions of people on ‘ dead ’ tariffs which are no longer available , particularly the vulnerable elderly , will be automatically switched to the best deal for their circumstances to save up to £ 150 a year			0
@entity29 currently has the powers to investigate energy firms which it believes to have incorrectly sold products , failed to help vulnerable customers , or acted anti-competitively			1
if they are found to have breached their licence conditions , they can be fined up to 10 per cent of turnover			0
but this money simply goes into the @entity127 ’s coffers unless the firm chooses to compensate their customers			0
@entity27 offered £ 1.5million to repay its customers last month after it was exposed for having lied about the savings households could make by switching from other firms			2
but while 11,000 people lodged claims for compensation , this would give each victim only £ 65 , when the first 4,400 claims processed by the company found an average customer loss of £ 100			0
@entity140 was last year fined £ 4.5million after its doorstep salespeople were found to have exaggerated the financial savings customers could make by switching from other providers			0
after negotiating an agreement though @entity29 , it agreed to pay £ 3.5million to 70,000 ‘ vulnerable ’ customers at risk of fuel poverty , and agreed to fund a £ 1million helpline			0
but an @entity29 document published afterwards said they were urging ministers to make it a legal obligation to compensate all customers who were mis - sold , to send out a strong message			0
it stated : ‘ @entity29 does not have the power to compel companies who are found in breach of their licence conditions to provide redress , including compensation to customers but it is seeking such powers from government			1
‘ if granted , these powers would strengthen @entity29 ’s ability to take more targeted action against companies who have breached their licences , including directing funds to customers where appropriate			0
’ @entity177 at uswitch said : ‘ the regulator wanted this power , so this is great news			0
it will have full powers you would expect to protect the needs of consumers if this is made law			1
’ a government source told the @entity187 : ‘ at a time of rising bills and concerns about the cost of living , this is intended to put power back in the hands of the consumer			0
the @entity18 will be made to toe the line , so customers who are ripped off can claim compensation			2

new powers for regulator to force firms to provide recompense
follows a series of price - fixing scandals by the @entity18 energy firms
consumer groups welcome help to protect *billpayers*
