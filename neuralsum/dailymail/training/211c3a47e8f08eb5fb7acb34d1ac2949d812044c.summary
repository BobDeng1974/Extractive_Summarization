by @entity0 published : 08:43 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 11:44 est , 29 july 2013 @entity1 : @entity2 , 45 , is fighting for the right to stay in the forces home she shared with her husband after he left her the ex-wife of an @entity9 squadron leader has launched a legal battle against the @entity11 - claiming its bid to remove her from her forces home after her husband left her breaches her human rights			1
@entity2 , 45 , lived at the three - bedroom @entity16 - owned property in @entity18 , @entity19 , for eight years with her husband , squadron leader @entity20			1
but after the couple separated and mr @entity20 moved out of their home in 2007 , mrs @entity2 was told she no longer had a right to live in the property			1
the @entity11 then obtained a court possession order in 2010 , but mrs @entity2 refused to leave and has been effectively squatting in the property since			1
mrs @entity2 is now contesting the order in the @entity29 in the first case of its kind			1
her lawyers argue that removing mrs @entity2 from the property would amount to discrimination and breach her right to respect for her home and private life			2
the court heard the property was purchased by the government in 1996 to house an overspill of @entity9 personnel and their families			0
but mrs @entity2 's counsel , @entity45 , insisted the @entity11 does not need the house for another services family to live in and just wants to ' sell it without a sitting tenant '			2
he added that she potentially faces life on the street if evicted , because @entity51 do not class her as a local resident , and will not give her housing priority due to her semi-itinerant status as a forces wife			0
' mrs @entity2 has lived at the property for over eight years , has gone through difficult divorce proceedings , has no other accommodation and risks being street homeless if evicted from the property			2
she is unlikely to obtain assistance as a homeless person , ' the barrister said			0
@entity66 , for the @entity11 , told the judge that mrs @entity2 only ever had a right to live in the house under a ' licence ' granted to her husband alone , and that was lawfully revoked after he moved out			1
for @entity9 personnel only : @entity2 and her husband @entity20 lived in the property in @entity18 , @entity19 , pictured for eight years but the @entity11 said she no longer has the right to live there after he moved out ' in april 2007 , mr @entity20 moved out of the property following a breakdown in his marital relationship with his wife			1
the licence is stated to be entered into between the @entity82 , on behalf of the secretary of state for defence , and squadron leader @entity20			2
' in the events that have occurred , including mr @entity20 permanently leaving the property and the @entity11 serving notice , the licence has been terminated , ' the barrister insisted			0
he said that the @entity11 ’s stance is backed by legislation and denied that its aim is to get mrs @entity2 out merely to ease the sale of the house or get a better price for it			0
' our aim is to recover possession of the property in order to fulfil a key aspect of the @entity11 ’s statutory functions , namely providing accommodation to servicemen and servicewomen , ' he added			0
recognising the wide importance of the case , mr @entity106 reserved his decision until an unspecified later date			0
mrs @entity2 , who was has been married to her husband for 15 years , said outside court : ' the council do n’t see me as a local resident because i come from a services family , so they wo n’t give me any priority for housing even if i become homeless			0

@entity2 , 45 , lived at the property for @entity9 personal with her husband
but after squadron leader @entity20 moved out of the house in 2007 , she was told she no longer had a right to live in the property
