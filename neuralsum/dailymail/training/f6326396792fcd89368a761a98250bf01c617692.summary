by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:27 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 05:24 est , 30 may 2013 @entity2 today insisted he was backing @entity3 ' all the way ' after claims he was waiting for the prime minister to fail at the next election			1
@entity9 spin doctor @entity8 claimed the @entity11 mayor would not ' stab ' the @entity13 leader in the back but preferred to ‘ ride in on his bike to save party and country ’ should mr @entity3 and the @entity13 lose the 2015 general election			1
but mr @entity2 sought to play down the idea , insisting h was now ' increasingly confident ' that mr @entity3 would retain power in two years ' time			1
mr @entity2 has pledged to complete his term as @entity11 mayor , which ends in 2016			2
but he has never ruled out returning as an mp , which would enable him to put himself forward as @entity13 leader			0
mr @entity8 , who is due to stand trial later this year over allegations related to phone - hacking , made his comments in an article he wrote for @entity46 on his 10 - point master plan for ‘ saving ’ mr @entity3			1
he wrote : ‘ @entity2 desperately wants to be prime minister and @entity3 has known that fact longer than most			1
‘ when @entity2 asked me to pass on the message that he was keen to stand as mayor of @entity11 , @entity3 responded : “ well , if he wins , he ’ll want my job next ”			2
’ @entity8 ( right ) said @entity3 knows @entity2 wants to be prime minister but the mayor of @entity11 thinks it would ' off brand ' to directly challenge him mr @entity8 went on : ‘ if proof were needed that our pm is a man untroubled by self - doubt , it came in his next sentence - “ so i think he ’ll be a bloody brilliant candidate for us ”			1
‘ stabbing @entity3 , or anyone else for that matter , in the back would be distinctly off brand - just not very @entity2			2
' he would much prefer to see @entity3 fail miserably in the election and ride in on his bike to save party and country			2
’ but mr @entity2 , who has hinted at a desire to lead the @entity13 party if called upon , insisted he was backing mr @entity3			1
arriving at a @entity71 , he said : ' @entity73 as i always am to @entity8 for career advice , i am backing @entity3 all the way			2
' i 'm backing @entity3 who i am absolutely increasingly confident is going to win , ' he added			0
mr @entity8 said the @entity78 ’ strategy for beating @entity79 should involve exposing leader @entity81 ’s penchant for ‘ keeping his head down ’ and ‘ pray @entity83 remains shadow chancellor until the election ’			1
on mr @entity81 , he wrote : ‘ the prime minister must push him to take positions : expose his strategy ( to keep his head down , silently hope that the economy continues to go wonky and , well , just be the other guy ) , challenge him to take a view on the tricky issues opposition politicians love to duck ...			1
he said @entity81 appointing @entity83 as @entity95 was the ' gift that will keep on giving ' ‘ i ’m struck by how detached the opposition front bench appears to be from their leader ... i just do n’t think they rate him very much			0
' and if they do n’t , there ’s a good chance the public will feel the same way once they get to know him properly			0
’ he likened the relationship between mr @entity81 and mr @entity83 to the ‘ shamefully dysfunctional ’ @entity109 and @entity110 partnership when @entity79 were in power			0
‘ the prime minister should pray @entity83 remains shadow chancellor until the election , ’ mr @entity8 wrote			1
‘ appointing him as @entity116 ’s opposite number was the @entity81 gift that will keep on giving			0
‘ the @entity78 must look for the divisions and make the most of them a ) because they are most certainly real - always a plus - and b ) because it ’s history repeating itself			0
‘ we are in this hole at least in part because of the shamefully dysfunctional @entity109 / @entity110 relationship			0
@entity79 ’s two eds dislike each other and each thinks he is smarter than the other			0
‘ the conservatives should imagine in some detail how it would work if they actually won , and share that vision with the @entity135 public			0
’ mr @entity8 is also facing charges over an alleged conspiracy to bribe public officials for information			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
