the new pioneers : tired of handing over all their cash in mortgage payments , @entity10 and @entity11 from @entity12 have built this tiny home that 's so cheap their living expenses have fallen to just $ 350 a month simple life : since there 's not much space inside their new 204sq/ft home the couple also enjoy the great outdoors more often , with mr @entity11 saying that whenever the @entity38 shines he 's outside soaking it up mr @entity11 told the @entity39 : ' i know what it 's like to have a big house with a tremendous amount of stuff			1
this culture of acquiring more is not necessarily a healthy way to live			0
' the couple , who have been married since 2009 , were spurred to fulfil long - held ambitions to downsize after mr @entity11 lost his home in the banking crisis			1
' i ended up having to foreclose , ' he told @entity53			0
' now with the market the way it is and everything , i decided i do n't want to play that game any more			0
' he added to the @entity39 : ' i got absolutely tired of it , all the interest i was paying			2
at that point , i said i ’m not going to deal with banks ever again			0
' a view through the house takes in the living room kitchen and bedroom : since mr @entity11 works as a builder , and his wife is an architectural designer , the pair had more than enough expertise for the build creature comforts : mrs @entity74 works on her laptop which is resting on a flip out desk attached to her sofa			1
the couple were spurred to fulfil ambitions to downsize after mr @entity11 lost his home in the banking crisis this is where the magic happens : the @entity88 ' bedroom is just large enough to fit their queen - sized bed efficient use of space : beneath the bed there is enough room for a wardrobe and even a dog kennel , while the bathroom is little more than a shower with a built - in sink			1
there is more storage space above the shower unit since mr @entity11 works as a building contractor , and his wife is an architectural designer , the pair were had more than enough expertise to make their dream a reality the @entity11 's compact home , which measures just 24ft by eight feet , has been designed with their habits in mind and uses every inch as efficiently as possible			1
their possessions , which they have had to dramatically cull , can be stashed in storage spaces beneath their living room sofa and above their bathroom , which has been so miniaturised it consists of just a shower with a sink inside			2
to keep their lifestyles as eco-friendly as possible , the couple collect rainwater from their metal roof and use an incinerating toilet so they do n't need their home to be plumbed in			2
since there 's not much space inside the couple also enjoy the great outdoors more often , with mr @entity11 saying that whenever the @entity38 shines he 's outside soaking it up			1
on the road again : the whole home is built on the back of a trailer and can be towed wherever they want seeking adventure : @entity142 to get closer to the untamed wilderness of the @entity144 , the @entity88 recently hitched their home to a pick up truck and moved from @entity12 to @entity146 , @entity147 of course , the real benefit is their dramatically slashed living costs			1
land rent , electricty and water for their new home adds up to a paltry $ 350 ( £ 230 ) a month , compared to the $ 1,500 ( £ 980 ) they paid for their old house			2
' i definitely analysed the options , ' said mrs @entity74			0
' and if our expenses are $ 300 a month compared to $ 1,300 a month we can saive up so much more			0
' and though it can get cramped in the winter , compact living has its benefits			0
' we can actually probably clean our whole house in about five minutes , ' mr @entity11 told @entity53			1
moving too , is simple			0
