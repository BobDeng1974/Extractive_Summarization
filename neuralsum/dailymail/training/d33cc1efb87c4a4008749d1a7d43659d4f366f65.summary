when the first episode of @entity2 was screened 50 years ago this month there were more than twice as many people inside @entity4 watching @entity5 play @entity6 than there were watching on tv later			1
@entity9 , the veteran broadcaster who would go on to become such an integral part of a programme that remains a saturday night comfort blanket for millions of football fans , was among that select audience of just 20,000 people who tuned in to see a highlights package of @entity5 ’s 3 - 2 win			1
the programme back in august 1964 was low - tech , without fanfare , only available on @entity20 to viewers in and around @entity22 , and barely made it to a second season			1
and , just as today , it was tv rights and money that was almost its undoing			0
wrapped up : @entity9 , the veteran broadcaster , believes @entity2 still plays an integral role many clubs , fearing this new programme would drastically reduce gates , were involved in a two - month stand - off with the @entity20 at the end of the 1964 - 65 season as they demanded more cash from the corporation			1
and they got their way as the @entity40 caved in , agreeing to double the clubs ’ collective fee to — wait for it — the princely sum of £ 25,000			2
given that any club , from @entity47 to @entity48 , could have appeared on @entity2 , the new money worked out , on average , at £ 271.74 per club per in 1965 - 66			1
last season , @entity50 alone raked in £ 72million in tv money while this coming season , 2014 - 15 , the @entity20 are paying £ 59.9m to show highlights of the @entity55 alone			1
@entity56 and @entity57 are paying £ 3bn for top - flight rights over three years			2
times may have changed where money in football is concerned , but the enduring charm and relevance of @entity2 has n’t , certainly not in the opinion of two of its doyens , @entity9 and @entity67			1
‘ a lot of people have grown up with it , ’ says @entity9 , 69			1
‘ it ’s traditional , it ’s safe , and it ’s predictable in the sense you know what you ’re going to get			0
that ’s why you turn it on			0
black and white : @entity5 vs @entity6 in 1964 was featured on the first ever @entity2 broadcast ‘ at the end of the week @entity2 presented a comprehensive , detailed round - up of exactly what had gone on			1
people felt when they turned it off and went to bed at 11.30pm they had caught up with all the football news			1
‘ i do still think that ’s the case , you only have to look at the audience figures			2
it gets between four and five million and i can think of a lot of programmes on a lot of channels which would love those numbers			1
’ @entity67 , who worked on the programme from 1969 - 2004 , said : ‘ it was n’t available to the whole country when it started and many people thought it would never catch on			1
the powers - that - be were certain that it would , and after @entity105 won the @entity106 in 1966 , it really took off			2
’ after two years on @entity20 , @entity2 made the leap to @entity108 , following the heroics of @entity111 ’s @entity105 team , even though league champions @entity5 and @entity114 holders @entity112 were among a minority of clubs still unhappy with it			1
‘ the viewers ’ sense was they were watching the best football in the world , and @entity105 were the best having won the @entity106 , ’ says @entity67			2
‘ pubs would empty just before 10pm on saturday so people could get home to watch it			0
it sounds extraordinary now , but it was true			0
i was in awe of it as a programme			2
’ capture the moment : @entity2 still attracts viewing figures between four and five million @entity9 ’s big breakthrough came when @entity133 upset @entity134 in the third round of the 1972 @entity114 and the match was promoted to top of the running order			1
‘ it was originally called @entity2 because they were only allowed to show one game , ’ he says			1
‘ @entity142 presented the first show from the pitch at @entity4 , there was no studio			2
when i started there were only four cameras ; two up on the main gantry , one lower down and , if they were lucky , maybe one behind one of the goal			0
‘ in my first decade , with @entity67 doing the other game , the @entity20 only had one machine to replay action and that was used on the saturday afternoon racing			2
so when a goal was scored in one of our games , @entity161 or i had to retrace it as best we could as the players ran back to the centre circle			2
‘ i would just hope i ’d got the passing movement right			0
then they put the pictures in later in the evening			0
now , when a goal is scored , i get about five replays , probably two more than i need			0
’ @entity67 joined the @entity20 from @entity170 in the summer of 1969 , a few months before his 32nd birthday , to commentate primarily on north - west matches			1
he would become part of a line of treasured household names associated with the show , from @entity177 and @entity178 in the early years , to @entity179 , @entity9 , @entity180 and @entity181			1
pundits : @entity2 's @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity181 and recently retired @entity185 @entity67 ’s first assignment was supposed to be covering @entity187 against @entity188 on august 9 , 1969			1
but over breakfast he was told @entity178 had laryngitis and would miss his own match , @entity192 against @entity47 , for which @entity67 was now expected to stand in			0
‘ my preparation was virtually nil , ’ he says			0
he commentated on a 2 - 2 draw and then hurried to the @entity20 ’s @entity195 where he helped @entity196 to present that night ’s @entity2 , as two @entity192 players , @entity199 and @entity200 , were studio guests			1
the 1969 - 70 experiment of regional second matches did not work			0
the second match was n’t always good quality ; resources were thinner than now , cameras less common			0
by 1970 - 71 , more resources were pushed into a two - match show each week , expanding over time to be highlights of multiple games			2
‘ the biggest change in football in 50 years is , i ’d say , that it ’s no longer the game of the man in the street , ’ says @entity67			0
‘ the general public had a rapport with the players they no longer have			0
when i started , players did n’t turn up in swish coaches or even swisher cars			0
you had a chance to establish relationships , as did the supporters			0
’ @entity67 ’s mellifluous , measured tones can still be found on archive footage accompanying classic clips , such as one from december 1974 when title rivals @entity50 and @entity231 met at @entity232			0
former city hero @entity233 scored the winner for @entity235 ’s @entity231 , who would go on to win the title			0
@entity67 ’s prescient commentary summed up the importance			0
old school : @entity179 presents the @entity20 football show in 1981 , before the likes of @entity185 ‘ interesting , ’ he said as @entity233 unleashed his shot			1
‘ very interesting , ’ he added as it screamed into the top corner			0
‘ oh , look at his face , just look at his face , ’ he added , telling viewers all they needed to know about the potential consequences			0
every viewer will have their own favourite @entity2 moments			2
many will recall @entity185 , for example , in august 1995 , telling viewers after a 3 - 1 win by @entity256 over @entity47 : ‘ you ca n’t win anything with kids			1
’ @entity47 went on to win the @entity260 that season			0
@entity9 , veteran of some 2,000 games , reprises his argument that the show should not alter too much to keep pace despite being up against an ever - increasing amount of live football on rival channels			1
‘ it would be inadvisable to suddenly think : “ we ’ve got to change everything and everybody ”			0
they ’ve made one or two moves with pundits but by and large i think the tradition and the historic significance of @entity2 is its strength			1

the programme back in august 1964 was low - tech , without fanfare , and only available on @entity20 to viewers in and around @entity22
the show barely made a second season as clubs feared it would drastically reduce gates and ticket *revenue*
@entity9 believes @entity2 is still an important medium for football news , with viewing figures between four and five million
@entity9 says the show should not alter too much because of ever - increasing amounts of live football on rival channels
