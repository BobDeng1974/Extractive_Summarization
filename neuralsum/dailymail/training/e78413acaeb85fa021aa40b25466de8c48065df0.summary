@entity0 has his sights raised towards winning a world heavyweight title as early as next year but he remains heart - warmingly in touch with the more humble amateur environment which turned him from a street chump into an @entity9 champ			1
@entity10 turned professional a year after striking gold at the @entity12			2
yet he still makes the trek north from @entity14 to the @entity15 in @entity16 where several of his former @entity18 team - mates continue to work under national coach @entity20			1
@entity0 found himself not only helping @entity32 ’s leading amateur boxers get ready for this summer ’s @entity33 in @entity34 but also sitting in on @entity36 ’s gruelling preparations for his mega-rematch with @entity38			1
@entity20 , who trains both @entity18 and the @entity39 , cleverly links those amateur and professional experiences to the benefit of both parties			1
@entity0 never forgets how the uplifting atmosphere which @entity20 created in the build - up to the @entity45 helped him turn away from the drug - strewn temptations of gang - land			1
he has talked eloquently and often about how boxing enabled him to transform his life but his actions speak even louder than those words			2
there has not been so much as a hint of a relapse since his solitary cannabis conviction four years ago			2
furthermore , but he is already giving back to the sport which rescued him			0
@entity0 journeyed to @entity16 to spar with his likeliest successor in the @entity18 team , the new @entity60 champion @entity21			1
‘ if i can be of help i ’m only too pleased , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but it ’s no hardship for me			0
i loved my time with the amateurs			0
i love coming back to see the guys and working with them			0
i only wish i could do it more often			0
’ a sense of belonging with this amateur family made @entity0 hesitate about turning pro for a full year after his @entity9 triumph and he was strongly tempted to go on to @entity70			1
now the aura of nostalgia draws him back and the lads in vests are thrilled to see him			0
machine : @entity0 has stopped each of his five opponents since turning professional last year dangerous : @entity0 has adapted to live in the paid ranks with ease having won @entity9 gold as an amateur next up : @entity0 takes on @entity82 ( left ) on the undercard of @entity36 's rematch with @entity38 @entity0 ’s arrival galvanises the camp , as does @entity36 ’s regular presence during training for his big world super-middleweight title fights			1
these two are glittering examples of what the future may hold for a dedicated and successful amateur			0
for @entity10 , the chance to talk professionally with @entity36 is a bonus			2
@entity0 faces @entity82 on the undercard of @entity98 and he is thrilled to be appearing in front of an unprecedented 80,000 crowd at @entity101			2
‘ i ca n’t wait , ’ he says			0
this will be a huge night in my life			0
’ @entity0 believes this exposure to the big - time will help accelerate his ascent to the world heavyweight title			1
it is only seven months since the first of his five paid victories but he says : ‘ i ’m already thinking about challenging @entity111 in 2015			0
’ that may require him to take up the offer of a big @entity32 battle with @entity115 en route , assuming @entity118 ’s giant traveller beats @entity119 in their summer rematch			0
but @entity36 does nothing to dampen the enthusiasm			2
he tells @entity124 : you ’re doing great			0
boxing is a short career but it can earn a long living			0
you must stay focused and totally dedicated			0
that does mean making sacrifices now			0
but it ’s only for a few years and it ’s worth it			0
’ @entity36 , as he goes into his 12th consecutive world title fight , is living proof of that – as well as an inspiration to the young men who are the long - term future of the @entity32 ring			1
unstoppable ? @entity111 ( right ) stopped @entity143 to retain his heavyweight world titles challenge : @entity0 believes he will be ready to take on world champion @entity111 next year @entity147 rewarded for @entity148 @entity150 ’s gamble that he would excite the wide world of boxing with his appearance on @entity154 ’s latest under - card in @entity155 has reaped its first reward			1
the @entity157 have promoted him to the position of no 1 challenger to @entity154 for their world welterweight title			1
this does not mean he gets the next shot at the best pound - for - pound boxer on the planet , even though the @entity157 were clearly impressed by his 12 - round , three knock - down demolition of respected former world champion @entity167			1
but in holding back from enforcing the young man from @entity169 as the mandatory contender that organisation is respecting @entity150 ’s @entity173 obligation to observe @entity174 , which renders him unavailable for @entity154 ’s next outing in september			1
reward : @entity150 ( left ) is now ranked no 1 with the @entity157 after his win over @entity167 demolition : @entity150 looked impressive as he dismantled @entity179 in @entity155 earlier this month the odds are – assuming that @entity154 beats whoever he chooses to face in that fight and @entity150 wins an interim contest of his own in late october or early november – that the @entity157 will call for them to face each other next may			1
prior to his fight for redemption little more than a fortnight ago , there was much scoffing at the conviction held by some , myself included , that @entity150 has specific assets which could cause @entity154 serious problems			1
now , after seeing @entity150 dazzle and his former victim @entity196 give @entity154 a tough time , the belief is growing that @entity199 ’s lightning speed might trouble a slightly slowing @entity201 man			1
what a difference a night makes			0
@entity203 ? the man who calls himself @entity201 may yet be coerced into the fight the world wants to see above all others by finance , of all things			2
a fall in pay - per - view ratings in @entity212 is being blamed in some quarters there on the failure of @entity154 and @entity216 to get into the ring with each other			1
signs of declining public interest in these , the two greatest pound - for - pound fighters in the world today , going through the formality of beating other opponents are detected in television box office returns projected at less than a million for their most recent fights			1
drop : @entity154 's fight with @entity196 is expected to have seen a drop in pay - per - view revenue unbeaten : @entity154 ws given a torrid time by @entity196 before preserving his perfect record @entity216 ’s promoter @entity231 has admitted to no more than 650,000 subscribers for the @entity234 telecast of his man ’s revenge win over @entity237 last month			1
meanwhile , more than two weeks after the event , the @entity239 network have still not released figures for @entity243 ’s win over @entity196			0
the boxing grapevine is a-rustle with whispers of 850,000 buys , which would fall short of their minimum pre-fight prediction of one million			0
what is certain is that there will be a huge drop from the 2.2million sales for @entity154 ’s preceding fight with @entity254 , which stands second in the all - time pay - per - view ratings to mr @entity258 ’s historic battle with @entity259 which drew 2.4m			1
@entity154 was guaranteed at least us $ 32million for this fight and should still bank more than $ 40m			1
but the @entity262 @entity261 in @entity212 is flatly discounting his boast of a $ 70 million pay - @entity264 he can not improve the numbers for his next fight in september – which may or may not be a re-match with @entity196 once the true income from their first fight is taken into account – he may struggle to reach the $ 300 million estimate for his six - fight contract with @entity239			1
three of those spectaculars are yet to come			0
take that : @entity216 earned his revenge over @entity237 with victory in their rematch last month will it happen ? @entity216 has so far failed to agree terms with @entity154 for a mega fight @entity216 , meanwhile , is heading for a fifth fight in his series with @entity286 in the autumn following the @entity288 ’s predictable win over @entity289 at the weekend			1
that would test the public ’s appetite for repetitive contests			0
still , @entity154 finds reasons for not fighting @entity216			1
first the @entity216 consented to @entity9 standard random blood testing			2
then he agreed to take less than 50 per cent of the money			0
now @entity154 is insisting that @entity216 dumps @entity231 , which frankly is none of his business even though he walked out on the @entity300 promoter at the height of a bitter dispute some years ago			1
but when it comes to @entity201 , money talks			0
unless the returns pick up , @entity239 may well insist that he fights @entity216 during the course of their current contract			2
nor is it any secret that in @entity154 ’s hands money evaporates like water in the @entity313 desert			2
still going strong : @entity286 ( left ) comfortably outpointed @entity289 at the weekend let 's do it again : @entity286 could now face @entity316 in the autumn in the fifth leg of their rival although his career earnings are reported close to $ 400 million , his current net worth is put at $ 216 million			0
the high - end gambling in his home town of @entity155 , the extravagant spending on such luxury goods as @entity327 , @entity328 and diamond - encrusted watches , the expanding entourage and the separations from the mothers of his children can quickly mount up			2
then there are the run - ins with the @entity336 and it may be that the only resolution to the tax man will be to call the @entity216			2
perhaps mr @entity258 will rake in another $ 300 million before he ’s done			0
but then so did @entity340 ...			0

@entity0 is *confident* he will be ready for a world title shot next year
he trains with his former @entity18 team - mates and world champion @entity36
@entity150 is ranked no 1 by the @entity157 after his victory over @entity167
declining *ppv* numbers could see @entity154 fight @entity216
