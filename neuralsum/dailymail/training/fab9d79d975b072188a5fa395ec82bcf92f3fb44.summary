although they are now considered to be common again , the distribution of the species is patchy capturing the images just twenty metres above him , @entity7 watched from the ground as the white - tailed kite passed over the meadow vole to her youngster ' you are unable to register the details and unique poses , which is why it 's so great to capture moments like this on camera			2
' very often , people wonder how and where i took the picture , but it pleases me if i hear people say that they enjoy my pictures			0
