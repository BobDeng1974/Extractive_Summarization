@entity0 has issued a humbling apology to the @entity2 for letting slip her ecstatic reaction to the @entity5 referendum result			1
the prime minister said he was ‘ very embarrassed ’ and ‘ extremely sorry ’ to have revealed the @entity2 ’s private views during a conversation he did not know was being picked up by microphones			1
his public apology to the monarch is thought to be without precedent for a serving premier			2
he said he would be following it up with a personal phone call			0
he was caught on camera on tuesday telling @entity24 billionaire @entity19 that the @entity2 had ‘ purred down the line ’ when he called her last week to say @entity5 had voted by 55 per cent to 45 to remain part of the @entity45			1
in @entity46 for a @entity48 meeting last night , mr @entity0 said he was mortified to have breached the long - established protocol that content of conversations between the @entity2 and prime ministers is never discussed			1
he said @entity54 officials had already been in touch with @entity56 to offer his apologies , and indicated that he would personally say sorry to her majesty when he next has his regular face - to - face audience with her			1
but the conversation may have to wait unless he makes it by telephone as they are not due to meet until she returns from @entity5 in early october			0
asked if he regretted discussing the @entity2 ’s thoughts and whether he would apologise to her , he replied : ‘ yes and yes			1
’ during the walkabout , mr @entity0 also vowed to ' sue ' polling companies who suggested the @entity72 campaign was ahead in the referendum campaign , claiming the stress and worry had given him ' stomach ulcers ' mr @entity0 said he regretted discussing the @entity2 's personal views and said he would personally apologise in the video recording , @entity0 can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the @entity2			1
he said : ' the definition of relief is being the prime minister of the @entity45 and ringing the @entity2 and saying ' it 's alright , it 's okay '			1
' she purred down the line ... ' but it should never have been that close			0
' it was n't in the end , but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt … ' i 've said i want to find these polling companies and i want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through			0
' it was very nervous moments			0
' he added : ‘ look , i ’m very embarrassed by this			2
i ’m extremely sorry about it			0
it was a private conversation , but clearly a private conversation that i should n’t have had and wo n’t have again			0
my office has already been in touch with the palace to make that clear and i will do so as well			0
’ a @entity56 source said archly : ‘ we are , of course , happy to facilitate any telephone call from the prime minister to her majesty			1
’ the apology came as mr @entity0 faced intense criticism over his gaffe			2
dr @entity121 , teaching fellow of modern history at @entity123 said : ‘ while it does n’t seem unnatural for the @entity2 to have an opinion … it was a particularly sensitive phone call telling her that her kingdom was intact			2
‘ it does seem like @entity0 has been terribly indiscreet , as if he was playing up [ to ] the bigger boys			2
’ he added : ‘ it was very naive not to think there was a chance of the conversation being picked up … given his choice of language , the [ description of her ] purring and the fact that there is an important constitutional convention here , i have to say it will be the most awkward phone call of his political career			2
’ in his apology , mr @entity0 said : ' look , i ’m very embarrassed by this			2
i ’m extremely sorry about it			0
it was a private conversation , but clearly a private conversation that i should n’t have had and wo n’t have again ' the royal gaffe is not the first time that @entity0 has put his foot in it			0
he once let slip that the @entity2 had teased him about a play in which she is depicted falling asleep at one of their meetings			2
the @entity2 assured him it had never happened in real life before adding – after a pause for comic effect – ‘ yet ! ’			1
mr @entity0 revealed the joke when he met @entity163 , one of the producers of the @entity165 , starring @entity166			0
mr @entity163 told @entity167 : ‘ mr @entity0 told it in a most amusing way			0
’ in january 2011 , the prime minister let slip that prince @entity171 had been lobbying against defence cuts			1
the second - in - line to the throne was angry at plans to close four air - sea rescue bases in a move designed to save millions of pounds			0
last december the judge overseeing the fraud trial of @entity180 and @entity182 ’s former personal assistants was forced to tell the jury to ‘ ignore ’ mr @entity0 after the prime minister declared he was a secret fan of the chef			1
the prime minister admitted in an interview in @entity188 – published midway through the trial – that he was a member of # @entity190 , used by those rooting for the @entity180 in her very public battle with her former husband			1
and in june this year mr @entity0 was rebuked by the judge presiding over the hacking trial after his comments about @entity198 nearly led to the collapse of the remainder of the case against his former spin doctor			0
@entity203 emerged on tuesday showing the prime minister laughing and joking with mr @entity19			1
although the pair knew they were being filmed , the fact their comments were picked up by microphones appears to have taken them by surprise			0
mr @entity0 can be heard to say : ‘ the definition of relief , if you are prime minister of the @entity45 , is ringing up @entity2 and saying , “ your majesty , it is all right , it ’s ok			1
she purred down the line			0
’ by longstanding convention , any discussion between the monarch and their prime minister should remain private , enabling the sovereign to ‘ advise , encourage and warn ’ with complete confidence			1
the fact the prime minister revealed details of such a sensitive conversation with the @entity2 simply to make idle chit chat will likely concern and anger her senior aides			1
leading up to the referendum , @entity56 stressed the @entity2 ’s neutrality and firm belief that the vote was a matter for the people of @entity5			1
@entity5 first minister @entity241 said mr @entity0 should ‘ hang his head in shame ’			1
the former @entity246 leader , who led the defeated nationalist campaign , gleefully told @entity248 : ‘ @entity0 has been prime minister for four years and he has n’t learned basic civility on not gossiping about what @entity2 thinks … that ’s absolutely pathetic and he should hang his head in shame			1
’ @entity254 mp @entity253 described mr @entity0 yesterday as a ‘ gossiping motormouth ’ , adding : ‘ i think it ’s a major blunder … particularly embarrassing because he was speaking about a sensitive and divisive political issue			2
’ but professor @entity259 , director of the @entity260 at @entity123 said : ‘ [ mr @entity0 ] had not intended his private remark to @entity262 to become public			2
he will be embarrassed … but no lasting damage has been done			0
’ @entity264 made the remark on @entity266 the @entity248 is under fire after a comedian suggested live on air that there should be a referendum on whether the @entity2 should be beheaded			1
the tasteless remark by comedian @entity264 , on @entity266 , follows the beheadings of @entity275 hostages by @entity277 extremists			0
he was on @entity278 , discussing the independence vote in @entity5 , when the guests were asked what else could there be referendums on and @entity264 suggested a vote on whether the @entity2 should be beheaded			2
listener @entity285 said : ‘ it was outrageous			0
it not only shows a complete lack of respect for the @entity2 but is also insensitive			0
the timing could not be worse			0
’ a @entity248 spokesman said : ‘ we have received four complaints			0

prime minister heard making indiscreet comments about the head of state
was talking to the former @entity46 mayor @entity19 on walkabout
revealed the moment he called the @entity2 to give her result on referendum
today said he was ' very embarrassed ’ and ‘ extremely sorry ’ for comments
he *confirmed* @entity54 had already apologised to @entity56
but he said he would be making his own person apology to the monarch
