after the final whistle , @entity0 was seen having a rare public chat with @entity1 owner @entity18			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 thought @entity4 should have finished the game with eight men @entity9 decided to caution @entity3 for a foul on @entity22 inside the penalty area @entity0 was of the opinion that @entity3 should have been given a straight red for his foul on @entity22 @entity0 said : ' i think the referee , from a technical point of view , had a fantastic performance in a difficult , technical , fast match with lots of runs behind - also the linesmen had a difficult game and i think they did a fantastic job			1
' but @entity4 could have finished with eight men , because it is a red card for @entity3 , it is a double yellow card for @entity39 in the first half , and clear was a red card for @entity6			1
" but i accept that the @entity6 red card was not given - the game was over and @entity6 is a good kid and is not aggressive			0
it was maybe just a reaction , some frustration			0
' so i have no complaint really			0
' @entity45 shoved @entity0 in the chest with 20 minutes gone at @entity8 on sunday @entity0 downplayed his first half touchline bust - up with @entity4 manager wenger by insisting it was ' no problem '			2
asked about the incident , @entity0 said : ' for me , it is over			0
' but the technical area is very clear - i have mine , he has his and he can not come to mine , especially to put pressure on the referee to give a red card to my player			0
' so i just told him " leave my technical area and do n't come back please "			0
' @entity0 , pictured with @entity18 and the @entity1 owner 's son @entity59 , looked in jubilant mood @entity18 will have been delighted with his side 's performance against @entity64 rivals @entity4 the @entity1 owner , pictured shaking @entity0 's hand , saw his side pick up all three points at the bridge			1
