by @entity0 a knitted patch made from drip - dry shirt material is being used to treat one of the most common causes of chronic pain			1
the polyester implant has transformed repairs to torn shoulder tendons			1
the patch is stitched in place over the rotator cuff , the muscle that allows the arm to raise			1
once in place , the patient ’s own tissue grows in and around the patch to seal it permanently in place , and also to prevent any more tears			0
invented by consultant orthopaedic surgeon @entity22 , a former @entity24 steeplechaser , the 40 - minute operation has been carried out on about 50 patients with very large tears – alleviating pain and restoring movement			1
mr @entity22 , who reached the final of the 3,000m at the 1984 @entity31 , explains : ‘ what to do with these patients was an unsolved surgical problem			1
it was awful having to tell them there was nothing else we could offer when they had lost the use of the shoulder , and were in severe pain			1
‘ these patients have considerable problems			0
they could not put their arm over their head , they had a shoulder that did n’t work , were in pain , particularly at night , and it affected their quality of life and their working life			2
’ he teamed up with @entity54 - based @entity53 , part of the medical device company @entity56 , to develop and produce the patch			2
shoulder pain affects up to a quarter of adults at some time , with about 70 per cent due to rotator - cuff tears			1
@entity22 ( left , 104 ) has invented the novel implant			1
the orthopedic surgeon is also a former @entity63 prevalence increases with age , rising to three - quarters of the over- 70s , although in many cases it does not result in serious symptoms			1
the shoulder joint is a ball - and - shallow - socket assembly and is covered by the rotator cuff , a group of four muscles and their tendons which keep the joint stable and drive shoulder movement			1
most rotator - cuff tears are caused by repetitive overhead arm movement			1
swimming , weightlifting , painting or window - cleaning can also increase the likelihood of shoulder pain associated with poor rotator - cuff function			1
the tear is a coming away of the attachment of the tendon to the bone of the top end of the arm			0
it can also be caused by trauma , such as a fall or dislocation			0
symptoms of a tear include significant pain at night , with an inability to lie on the affected side , loss of overhead movement , muscle weakness , and difficulty dressing and undressing			2
where the tear is relatively small – less than 3cm – it can be surgically repaired by bringing the tendon to the bone , then stitching and anchoring the soft tissue of the cuff in place			2
but sometimes the tear is simply too large and stiff and can not be stretched to the bone , making bigger tear repairs difficult			0
those greater than 5cm in diameter are not always repairable and gaps are left , leading to the tear returning with time			0
an added complication is that with advancing age , the tendons and muscles can deteriorate , making them unsuitable for stretching and stitching			0
mr @entity22 , consultant surgeon at @entity120 and @entity121 at the @entity122 , came up with the idea of the patch after being unable to offer a suitable treatment to his patients			1
the patch he developed is a woven polyester fabric			2
it is implanted using open surgery and a general anaesthetic , and is stitched into place over a repair of the torn rotator cuff			2
shoulder pain affects up to a quarter of adults at some time , with about 70 per cent due to rotator - cuff tears once in place , the patch , which comes in three sizes from 3cm to 5cm , reinforces the tissue and prevents future tears			1
it also reduces the load on the tissue			0
a key design feature is that its structure encourages the growth of the patient ’s own tissue into the patch material			0
early data shows that the patch , which has now been approved for use in the @entity155 and @entity156 , has been particularly successful in patients whose tendon tears have recurred after a normal repair , and in patients where a normal repair is not possible because the tendon is too stiff and the muscle wasted			2
@entity165 , a @entity54 - based joiner and builder , had a patch implanted in his right shoulder and is now waiting for surgery on his left			1
‘ i had a tear on the right side and it was very painful , especially when i lifted my arm above my head , ’ says @entity165 , 48			0
' after the patch was put on , the pain pretty much went away			0
i get the occasional twinge with movement , but considering that the tear was 5cm long , that ’s pretty good			0
i was very pleased with the outcome			0
‘ i think the problem began when i fell over playing football years ago , but with age it got worse			0
‘ the work involved in my job did n’t help either			0
the left shoulder has now gone , and i am waiting for a date for the next surgery			0
