campaigners in the @entity1 are fighting plans for a proposed ' eyesore ' fence which they say will spoil the national park and ruin its chances of becoming a world heritage site			1
water company @entity8 wants to erect the six - mile fence in open land above @entity11 , in a bid to keep out sheep from the three - square - mile area			1
they say ' over-grazing ' by the sheep has eroded the peat , causing it to wash down the hill and discolour the reservoir water			1
they also fear the barrier could undermine the government 's bid to make the @entity1 a world heritage site , something which will be considered by @entity43 's committee in june 2017			1
now @entity44 has waded into the debate , warning the move could open the floodgates for more development on open land in the national park			1
' it would take away the right of hill farmers to graze their animals there , but would also hinder hill walkers who have enjoyed the landscape for centuries , ' she told @entity59			2
@entity44 , the former @entity60 presenter , has joined campaign groups in opposing the plans she added that it would not only ' destroy the look of the landscape ' but would also ' prevent people from roaming freely '			0
the proposal , which is due to be considered by the government 's @entity67 later this year , said the fence would be temporarily erected for 15 years			2
@entity8 said the move is needed to stop peat entering @entity11 and contaminating the reservoir , which is one of the @entity74 ’s most significant sources of public drinking water			1
it also promised that access to walkers would not be hampered and that it would only prevent the free movement of livestock			0
@entity82 will be included at regular intervals , the plan says			0
but @entity84 , who represents @entity28 , said the fence was not ' temporary ' because it would be in place for 15 years			0
he said : ‘ the proposed fence will be one of the greatest threats the @entity1 has faced to the traditional openness and freedom of the fells			0
' it will impact on many walkers each year and it appears to run contrary to the principles of the bid for @entity99 inscription which @entity8 are supposedly supporting			1
’ @entity100 , mp for @entity102 and @entity103 , has also joined the campaign , saying the fence would jeopordise ' that combination of wild and pastoral that inspired @entity109 '			0
but biodiversity officer @entity110 , from @entity111 , said : ' it absolutely is n't our intention to hamper people 's access or enjoyment but what many probably do n't realise is that , although beautiful , the @entity11 valley is not working the way nature intended			2
' we 're trying to encourage natural vegetation which has been over-grazed for many years to regenerate and hopefully restore habitats like blanket bog , which is natural to the valley			0
' he added : ' unfortunately without a fence , it ’s hard to see how we can help restore the land			0

@entity8 wants a fence above @entity11 reservoir to keep out sheep
they say over-grazing causes peat to wash down hill and discolour water
but campaigners say fence will *restrict* walkers from roaming on open land
also fear it will put park 's bid for @entity43 world heritage site in *jeopardy*
