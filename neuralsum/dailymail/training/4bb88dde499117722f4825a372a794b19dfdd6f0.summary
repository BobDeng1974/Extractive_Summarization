@entity0 welcome @entity1 to @entity2 on sunday in what is @entity5 ’s first test against one of last season ’s top four			1
@entity0 have invested heavily over the summer in a bid to bridge that gap but the early signs are that there is still some way to go			2
here , @entity14 looks at the two squads and brings you our composite xi in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation … @entity5 ( left ) will face his first test against one of last season 's top four in the @entity23 as his @entity0 side go head - to - head with @entity1 and @entity26 at @entity2 on sunday goalkeeper – @entity28 the @entity29 is already widely considered the division ’s best stopper , and this after just eight matches back at @entity33			1
@entity34 , of course , rivals @entity28 for that mantle , but it is the @entity1 custodian who gets the nod			2
@entity28 has claimed the @entity1 no 1 jersey from @entity40 this year and deserves his place @entity34 is unlucky not to make the side after some wonderful displays for @entity0 right back – @entity45 the @entity46 is everything you want in a full back - he is powerful , pacey , combative and classy			1
it is n’t really a contest as to whether he or @entity54 gets the vote			0
@entity45 ( left ) easily gets the nod ahead of @entity0 's @entity54 for the right - back slot centre back – @entity59 the @entity1 captain continues to deliver week in , week out			1
he may have lost half a yard of pace , but he more than makes allowance with his cunning , leadership and will to win			0
@entity59 is exactly what @entity0 need			2
@entity59 leads from the front for the @entity69 and he is exactly what @entity0 are missing at the back right now centre back – @entity72 he is @entity73 ’s no 1 centre back and sets the standard to which the likes of @entity77 and @entity78 must strive			0
again , how @entity0 could do with him at the back right now			0
@entity72 ( left ) is @entity73 's first - choice centre back and he is picked ahead of @entity77 and @entity78 @entity77 ( left ) and @entity78 are yet to grow into the players they were expected to become in defence @entity84 – @entity85 he is simply a very good defender , and had to be to keep @entity86 out of the side last season			1
@entity89 remains unconvincing in @entity0 ’s colours , while @entity91 has been deployed at centre back			0
@entity85 kept @entity86 out of the @entity1 team last season and is an excellent defender @entity96 midfield – @entity97 the big @entity46 is the best at his trade in the @entity23 , protecting his back four but also boasting the creativity to spring offensives at the other end			0
@entity104 has some way to go before he is considered in @entity97 ’s class			0
@entity97 ( right ) is the best defensive midfielder in the league and gets picked ahead of @entity104 @entity96 midfield – @entity108 why did n’t @entity0 try to sign him ? they were crying out for an experienced midfielder of @entity108 ’ proven quality			1
he is already making a difference at @entity1			0
@entity108 ( right ) is already making the difference at @entity1 and @entity0 should have signed him up attacking midfield – @entity114 at last , a @entity0 entry			1
in fact , it would be difficult to keep @entity118 out of any side in the world right now			0
he has hit the ground sprinting at @entity2 and , without him , they would be residing a lot lower than sixth in the table			0
@entity114 is the only @entity0 player in the composite xi - but he would get into any side in the world attacking midfield – @entity130 the @entity29 is fast maturing into the player we all hoped he would be , consistently delivering rather than showing us the odd flash of genius			1
he is a joy to watch and makes it all look so effortless			0
hazard makes the side ahead of former team - mate @entity138			2
@entity130 is maturing into a class act and he is regularly putting in top - class performances now @entity141 ( left ) and @entity138 have not shown the form of @entity1 's attacking - midfield trio this season attacking midfield – @entity144 now this final attacking - midfield berth was the hardest call on the pitch , but it is the much - improved @entity148 who wins his place ahead of @entity141 and @entity138			1
@entity144 is marrying graft to his craft and has won the trust of @entity26			0
@entity144 ( right ) just gets the nod in attacking midfield ahead of @entity141 and former team - mate @entity138 striker – @entity157 the brutal brilliance of the @entity160 international has taken @entity1 to another level this season and , should he stay fit , they will win the league			1
at @entity0 , @entity164 is horribly out of form , while @entity166 has not adapted in the manner of @entity157 to the @entity23			1
@entity157 ( right ) has taken to the @entity23 extremely quickly and is banging in the goals @entity164 ( left ) is horribly out of form and @entity166 is yet to fully adapt to the @entity23 like @entity170 's facebook page .			2

@entity0 host @entity1 at @entity2 on sunday ( *4pm* kick - off )
in @entity14 's *combined* xi , only one @entity0 player makes the side
there are 10 @entity1 players , *including* @entity157 and @entity108
@entity114 is @entity5 's solitary player in the composite xi
