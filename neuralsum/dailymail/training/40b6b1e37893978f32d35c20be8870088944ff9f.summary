deaths from cuts and grazes , diarrhoea and flu will soon be common as antibiotics lose their power to fight minor infections , experts have warned			1
the @entity9 says the problem has been caused by antibiotics being so widely prescribed that bacteria have begun to evolve and develop resistance			1
it claims the crisis is worse than the @entity17 epidemic – which has caused 25million deaths worldwide – and threatens to turn the clock back on modern medicine			0
antibiotic resistance needs to be taken as seriously as @entity17 was in the 1980s , experts say the @entity9 warns that the public should ‘ anticipate many more deaths ’ as it may become routine for children to develop lethal infections from minor grazes , while hospital operations become deadly as patients are at risk of developing infections that were previously treatable			1
doctors are increasingly finding that antibiotics no longer work against urinary and skin infections , tuberculosis and gonorrhoea			1
the @entity9 is urging the public to take simple precautions , such as washing hands to prevent bacteria from spreading in the first place			1
doctors are also being told to prescribe antibiotics sparingly and ensure patients finish the full course , as if they stop mid-way the bacteria may become resistant			1
in @entity49 last year some 41.7million prescriptions were written out , up from 37.2million in 2006			0
mrsa - patients infected with @entity51 ( methicillin - resistant @entity52 ) are 64 per cent more likely to die than those with a non-resistant form of @entity52			0
people infected by resistant superbugs are also likely to stay longer in hospital and may need intensive care , pushing up @entity60 bacteria produces spores that are resistant to high temperatures and are very difficult to eliminate			1
it is spread through contaminated food and objects and can cause blood poisoning and tears in the large intestine			1
@entity69 - this now accounts for one in three cases of bacterial infections in the blood in the @entity74 and a new strain is resistant to most antibiotics			1
it is highly contagious and could cause more than 3,000 deaths a year			0
@entity79 - a common bacteria which is resistant to most antibiotics and which can easily infect patients in a hospital			1
it can cause meningitis and is fatal in about 80 per cent of @entity87 - this is a bacterium that is associated with extremely difficult to treat blood infections and meningitis			1
it is resistant to nearly all antibiotics and is fatal in 50 per cent of @entity94 - drug resistant tuberculosis is estimated to kill 150,000 people globally each year			1
@entity96 - 1 - a bacteria detected in @entity98 of which some strains are resistant to all antibiotics			1
dr @entity102 , the @entity9 ’s assistant director for health security , said : ‘ without urgent , co-ordinated action , the world is headed for a post-antibiotic era , in which common infections and minor injuries which have been treatable for decades can once again kill			1
‘ effective antibiotics have been one of the pillars allowing us to live longer , live healthier , and benefit from modern medicine			1
‘ unless we take significant actions to improve efforts to prevent infections , and also change how we produce , prescribe and use antibiotics , the world will lose more and more of these global public health goods and the implications will be devastating			1
‘ we should anticipate to see many more deaths			0
‘ we are going to see people who have untreatable infections			1
’ only last month , @entity74 ’s chief medical officer @entity125 criticised gps for needlessly ‘ dishing out ’ antibiotics to patients			1
in the largest study of its kind , the @entity9 looked at data from 114 countries on seven major types of bacteria			1
experts are particularly concerned about bacteria responsible for pneumonia , urinary tract infections , skin infections , diarrhoea and gonorrhoea			1
they are also worried that antiviral medicines are becoming increasingly less effective against flu			0
dr @entity144 , a senior adviser at the @entity9 , said : ‘ a child falling off their bike and developing a fatal infection would be a freak occurrence in the @entity74 , but that is where we are heading			1
’ @entity74 experts likened the problem to the @entity17 epidemic of the 1980s			0
professor @entity156 , who specialises in microbiology at the @entity158 , said : ‘ the world needs to respond as it did to the @entity17 crisis			0
‘ we still need a better understanding of all aspects of resistance as well as new discovery , research and development of new antibiotics			1
’ the first antibiotic , penicillin , was developed by sir @entity171 in 1929			0
but their use has soared since the 1960s , and in 1998 the government issued guidelines to doctors urging them to curb prescriptions			0
nonetheless , surveys suggest they are still prescribed for 80 per cent of coughs , colds and sore throats			0
the spread of deadly superbugs that evade even the most powerful antibiotics is happening across the world , @entity184 officials have confirmed			1
image shows the superbug @entity51 which already kills almost 20,000 people a year in @entity192 @entity193 and @entity194 , pictured , were distraught after losing their son @entity195 to a superbug the human cost of the rising number of superbugs is becoming all too familiar			2
distraught young couple @entity193 and @entity194 lost their second son to an infection at a hospital neo-natal unit in @entity205			0
@entity195 was born early at 24 weeks and although he had seemed well enough to go home with his parents , he soon fell dangerously ill. he was taken to @entity208 but the infection had taken hold and the youngster passed away			0
tragically the couple had lost another prematurely born son , @entity213 , to infection in 2010 , just five - and - a - half hours after his birth at 26 weeks			0
an inquest into @entity195 's death later found he had been killed by the pseudomonas bacteria			2
he was one of three babies in the hospital to be hit by the killer bacteria , which was later linked to baby deaths around the country			0
an investigation took place at the hospital into @entity195 's death , but it could not find what caused his infection			2
the inquest was told that @entity195 was being given two types of antibiotics before he died as a precaution , but neither specifically fought pseudomonas			2
as a result of the investigation the hospital also now uses antibiotics which more specifically target the bacteria			2
@entity238 of the international medical charity @entity239 agreed with the @entity9 's assessment and confirmed the problem had spread to many corners of the world			1
' we see horrendous rates of antibiotic resistance wherever we look in our field operations , including children admitted to nutritional centres in @entity250 , and people in our surgical and trauma units in @entity253 , ' she said			0
earlier this month , government body @entity254 said that one in 16 patients are developing infections on @entity259 wards because of poor hygiene among staff			2
@entity254 said 800 patients a day , the equivalent of 300,000 a year , are infected by a member of staff or by dirty equipment			0
it is estimated the infections cause 5,000 deaths annually and contribute to another 15,000			2
antibiotics are substances that kill or interfere with the growth of microorganisms , especially bacteria			2
but not all microorganisms are susceptible to all antibiotics , according to @entity49			2
microorganisms which are not killed or inhibited by an antibiotic are called ' antibiotic resistant '			0
they continue to grow and multiply in the presence of that antibiotics			2
there are several ways in which bacteria can be resistant			0
some destroy the antibiotic , for example by producing enzymes against it ; some prevent the antibiotic getting into their cells ; others get the antibiotic out of their cells before it can harm them			0
@entity296 does resistance develop ? some bacteria are naturally resistant ; new resistances also arise spontaneously by chance mutations and these resistant strains then multiply			0
some resistances can be passed from one bacterium to another , spreading resistance between species			0
loops of @entity308 ( called plasmids ) carry the resistance genes from one bacterium to another			0
when an antibiotic is given , it kills the sensitive bacteria , but any resistant ones can survive and multiply			0
the more antibiotics are used ( in animals and agriculture as well as in man ) the greater will be the " selective pressure " , favouring resistant strains - i.e. survival of the fittest			2
antibiotics do n't ' cause ' resistance ; rather , they create an environment which favours the growth of resistant varians which already exist in nature or arise by chance .			2

spread of deadly superbugs that evade antibiotics is happening globally
it 's now a major threat to public health , the @entity9 says
it could mean minor injuries and common infections become fatal
