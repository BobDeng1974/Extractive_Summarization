a coachload of schoolchildren was taken 80 miles in the wrong direction in the middle of the night after a driver misspelt their destination by just one letter			0
the driver accidentally typed @entity7 into his satellite navigation system , then promptly drove to the village near the seaside resort of @entity11 in north wales			1
unfortunately , his sleepy passengers had hoped to wake up in @entity14 , near @entity15 in west @entity16			2
the @entity18 coach , like the one pictured above , was returning from @entity19 the blunder occurred when the coach swapped drivers at @entity22 towards the end of a 13 - hour journey following a trip to @entity19			1
parents of the 37 pupils aged 11 to 14 , from @entity28 , were left waiting to collect their children for an extra two hours on tuesday morning			0
@entity30 , whose daughter @entity31 was on the coach , said : ‘ the teachers and the kids all fell asleep on the bus and when they woke up they realised they were going a different way to what they normally know			2
’ the teachers and children were taken to @entity7 in north wales instead of @entity14 which is 77 miles away mrs @entity30 added : ‘ they ended up in @entity7 , and then took an extra hour and a half to get back home , to the correct town			1
‘ i 'm not happy at all by what happened , especially because @entity31 suffers from travel sickness and so do a few other kids			0
’ the driver took the pupils and teachers to @entity7 , @entity50 , before delivering them to @entity14 , @entity51 , above cllr @entity52 , whose daughter was also on the trip with 36 other pupils , said : ‘ i was very annoyed by what happened			1
i am glad they all got back safely			0
‘ delivery drivers make the same mistake and people ring , saying , “ we ca n’t find you , we ’re in @entity7 ”			2
it happens all the time			0
’ ‘ it really was a ridiculous mistake to make			0
i do n't understand how the driver could have got it so wrong , there is a 77 - mile difference between both towns , they are in different counties and have a completely different spelling			2
’ the group of 37 pupils spent five days in @entity19 , pictured , on the school trip ( file picture ) a spokesman for @entity18 said : ‘ we have spoken to the driver of the coach and he was clearly instructed to go to @entity14 in @entity79			1
‘ he had then inputted the wrong town into his sat nav and took the passengers to @entity7 , near @entity11			0
‘ the driver is not from the area , and the situation will now be dealt with in a disciplinary hearing .			1

he typed in @entity7 instead of @entity14 , which is on a different coast
pupils and teachers *faced* two - hour *detour* at the end of 13 - hour trip
bus company has *apologised* and driver faces disciplinary hearing
