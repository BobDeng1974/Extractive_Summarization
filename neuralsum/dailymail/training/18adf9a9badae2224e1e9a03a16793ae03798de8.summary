you 're off off on your travels and you want to get to the airport quickly and with no hassle			2
if you 're flying from @entity4 , you might choose the @entity5 , which whizzes you through the @entity7 suburbs			1
but as you look forward to your flight , i wonder if you stop to think that you 're taking , on a cost - per - minute basis , the @entity12 's most expensive train journey ? worth the money : the @entity5 is the quickest way to @entity4 - but the price can be off - putting travelling on the service from @entity17 to @entity4 's terminals 1 - 3 takes 15 minutes , and the standard single fare is an eye - watering £ 21 if you buy your ticket before you board			1
so as you speed along , you 're spending £ 1.40 a minute			0
pay for your ticket on the train and the fare is even steeper , at £ 26 - or £ 1.73 a minute			2
given the sky - high prices , it 's hardly surprising that leisure passengers make up only 30 per cent of @entity5 users			1
rather belatedly , the company is trying to do something about this state of affairs by trialling a reduced - price fare			0
for tickets purchased between now and november 30 , the cost of a single journey has been cut by 25 per cent to £ 15 , and a return to £ 29 ( down from £ 34 )			0
to get the discounted fare , you need to book at least seven days ahead online ( www.heathrowexpress.com ) using the promotional code @entity40 ( 500 tickets are available each day )			0
though the @entity5 has offered deals for some time for couples and families , this is the first time it has lowered its prices for a person travelling on their own			1
which is good news , particularly if the advance - purchase fare continues to be available after november			2
this way for @entity52 : there are cheaper - although not necessarily faster - alternatives to the @entity54 but without wishing to pour cold water on the deal , there are still much cheaper , albeit slower , public transport options to get to @entity4 from @entity7			1
@entity59 ( www.heathrowconnect.com ) runs a stopping service between @entity17 and @entity4 , taking 32 minutes to terminals 1 - 3			1
the return fare is £ 19.80 - £ 9.20 cheaper than the @entity5 advance - purchase return			1
note that the connect service is less convenient for terminals 4 and 5 , as you need to change trains at the terminals 1 - 3 stop			2
there is also the @entity69 on the @entity70 : central @entity7 to @entity4 takes around 45 - 60 minutes , but costs just £ 6.10 for return journeys using an oyster card , or £ 11.40 return paying with cash			1
for journeys to other airports , it also pays to investigate the various options			0
for example , from @entity7 to @entity52 , the @entity54 ( www.gatwickexpress.com ) is the obvious choice			2
its @entity82 - @entity52 service takes 30 minutes and costs £ 31.05 return booked online			1
but with @entity86 ( www.thameslinkrailway.com ) , you can travel from @entity87 to @entity52 in 29 minutes on an anytime return ticket costing from £ 19			2
much cheaper still is @entity89 ( www.easybus.co.uk ) , non-stop from @entity90 or @entity91 to @entity52 , taking from 65 minutes			1
think ahead : you can save money on the @entity93 if you are prepared to book your ticket in advance the cost is from just £ 4 return if you book well ahead , and the service is available to all airline passengers , not just those flying @entity101			0
for @entity103 , it really pays to book ahead			0
the standard fare on the @entity93 ( www.stanstedexpress.com ) is £ 33.20 return from @entity106 , compared with £ 16 return if you book online at least 30 days in advance			0
but @entity89 can get you there and back for £ 4			0
you also need to be choosy if you are travelling cross-country to airports			0
go by train and you can be hit with cripplingly high fares for peak - time journeys			1
also , fixing the time of the return trip from the airport can be a headache , as you do n't know whether your flight will be delayed or how long it will take to pick up your bags			0
taking a coach can be well worth considering instead			0
@entity125 ( www.nationalexpress.com ) offers affordable fares to main airports from many @entity12 cities			1
over the summer it introduced a ' @entity130 ' option which , for £ 5 extra each way , allows you to get on any available coach 12 hours either side of your timed departure .			0

@entity5 to offer discounted fares on a trial basis in november
service is the quickest way to @entity12 's main airport - but prices are high
cheaper options exist to the @entity4 , @entity52 and @entity149 ' links
