far from just plonking a squirrel feeder in the back garden , @entity1 's elaborate set - up not only entices local wildlife but makes them stars of his hit web videos			1
writer and teacher @entity1 's latest creation is the @entity11 , or ' @entity12 - ional ' , featuring three of the little creatures in a race along an obstacle course hanging at his @entity18 home			1
' the obstacles started out as a way to cut down on the amount of nuts the squirrels were eating and went from there , ' @entity1 , dubbed the ' @entity20 of @entity21 ' on @entity22 , tells @entity29			2
' first it was a bird feeder on the end of the washing line but it 's become more and more advanced			0
' his previous ' cheeky squirrel ' videos have been viewed over one million times and feature , along with the squirrels , 50 - year - old @entity1 's witty , pun - filled commentary			2
' i wanted to do something different for the new one and had always wanted to do a race , so i thought why not the most famous race in the world , the @entity11 , ' he says			2
@entity1 created the elaborate set - up in his garden , calling it the @entity48 the teacher and writer hilariously narrates the antics of his two key racers filmed in october , @entity1 found time over the @entity54 break to edit his patiently compiled footage of @entity56 and @entity57 as they take on the five obstacle course , including a water jump - lord @entity61 showed promise but shied away from the jumps			1
while the squirrels look more than willing to take on the course , that 's largely thanks to @entity1 's clever method of introducing his little mates to the jumps made out of ' quality junk ' from around his house including pan scourers , plastic spoons			0
' i gradually move the nuts along the course so when they come to it they have a new challenge , but they 're very clever and work it out quickly , ' he says			0
the squirrels can be seen jumping over a series of fences on a suspended plank @entity57 tackles the longer of the jumps , unlike @entity56 who skirted round it the two squirrels finally reach their prize - and endless supply of nuts right at the end of the run @entity56 dips a paw in the water ... before stopping to have a quick drink while completing the course the teacher even set up a model to wave the flag to signal the beginning of the race @entity1 stresses while in a sense he 's training them to do the course , he would never hand feed them			1
' i 'd never do anything to harm them and they 're not doing anything more than they would in the wild , ' he says			0
' but they are a great source of entertainment for us			0
