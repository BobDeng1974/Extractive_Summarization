the population in @entity1 is rising more steeply than anywhere else in @entity3 , according to official estimates yesterday			1
numbers rose by almost 420,000 in a year , driven by the highest birth rate since 1972			2
the figure , which covers the 12 months to the middle of 2012 is more than the population increases in @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 combined			1
six out of ten are the result of rising birth rates , which brought a 40 - year high in the number of babies born last year – 254,400 more births than deaths			1
but a major cause of the baby boom is immigration			2
more than a quarter of all newborns have mothers who were born abroad			0
the total number of people living in the @entity1 at the end of last june was 63,705,000			1
the rate of population increase last year held steady despite @entity40 attempts to reduce immigration , the @entity17 said			1
its report said the 419,900 increase in population for 2011 - 12 was ‘ about average ’ for the past decade			2
annual population growth first hit the 400,000 mark in 2005 , following the opening of @entity1 ’s borders and labour market to @entity51 and other eastern @entity3 in 2004			2
the increase in the number of people living in the @entity1 was higher than any other country in the @entity56 if the increasing numbers continue unchecked , the population will hit the landmark 70million point in the early months of 2027			1
the figure is a level at which many commentators believe housing , transport , utilities , education and the @entity67 will be severely stretched			0
yesterday ’s estimates mean that by the middle of 2012 home secretary @entity72 ’s efforts to reduce net immigration – the amount by which migrants push up the population each year – to 1990s levels had yet to have an impact on the total number of people in the country			1
the figure is currently 165,000			0
divide : @entity83 and the south saw bigger increases in population between mid- 2011 and mid- 2012 @entity88 leader @entity87 said : ‘ these figures show the continuing failure of the government to get a grip on immigration into this country			1
the results of this increase in population can be felt in communities up and down the country as public services struggle to cope with the increase in demand			2
’ he added : ‘ at the same time we face cuts to frontline services and send billions of pounds abroad in foreign aid			0
and this is before @entity109 and @entity110 citizens have full access to the @entity1 come january next year			1
’ the @entity1 population increase was almost a third higher than the rise in the next fastest - growing @entity56 country , @entity115			1
during the same period the @entity115 population rose by just over 319,000			0
numbers in @entity10 went up by 166,000 , in @entity11 by 91,000 , in @entity13 by 70,000 and in @entity12 by 62,000			0
all have been magnets for immigration in recent years			0
but @entity1 ’s population is expected to outstrip those of @entity115 and @entity10 over the coming decades , becoming the most populous country in @entity3 by 2050			2
numbers here have gone up by more than half a million since the last national census , taken in march 2011			0
since 2001 the population increase has been 4.6 million , the @entity17 said			1
@entity83 saw the greatest rise in 2011 - 12 , at more than 100,000			2
the rapid change came despite 51,000 people leaving the capital , mainly for homes in the suburban towns of southern and eastern @entity133			0
@entity134 of the @entity17 said : ‘ a quarter of the @entity1 population increase happened in @entity83			1
together , @entity83 , the @entity137 and @entity138 accounted for over half the growth			0
’ the population pyramid shows how many people of each age there were , including the large numbers of so - called baby boomers and the low birth rate a decade ago one in three migrants arriving in @entity1 went to @entity83			1
international net migration – the number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants – was 69,000			1
@entity153 , of pressure group @entity154 , said : ‘ our growing population is the root of many of our most pressing problems , including a lack of housing , pressure on services and development threats to our countryside and green spaces			0
‘ these , together with consequent infrastructure investments and transport issues are increasing costs for everyone			0
‘ measures by the government to limit net migration are to be welcomed			0
however , the government should also promote the benefits to individuals and society of smaller families			0

new figures show there were *63.7million* in the @entity1 in mid- 2012
increase of 419,000 or *0.7* *%* in a year , @entity17 says
*813,200* births in 12 months , the largest number seen since 1972
165,600 more international migrants arrived than emigrants left
