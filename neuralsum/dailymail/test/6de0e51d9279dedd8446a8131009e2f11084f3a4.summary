@entity0 will make his first appearance since finishing second in the masters in the @entity4 , an event where he has an impressive recent record			1
former @entity9 champion @entity8 , who was joint second with @entity11 behind @entity12 at @entity13 , has not been outside the top 15 on his last three outings at @entity15			1
since missing the cut in 2011 , the 34 - year - old @entity17 star has finished 10th , 15th and eighth and is a total of 38 under par , with his last 12 rounds all at par or better			1
@entity0 finished joint second in the masters at @entity13 earlier this month @entity8 returns to action at the @entity4 at @entity15 this week @entity8 will play alongside two other players who performed well in the masters for the first two rounds , world number 13 @entity29 finishing 12th and @entity31 - 28th in his first tournament of 2015			1
@entity31 underwent back surgery in december last year and will continue to play a limited schedule as he works his way back to full fitness , but the 48 - year - old has not given up hope of another @entity17 appearance even though the @entity40 looms when he turns 50			1
' no matter what tournament i go to i want to be prepared and to play well and this is no different , ' @entity31 told a pre-tournament press conference			2
' even though it 's only my second event , i have high expectations of what i can do and what i should do			0
so i come here thinking that i can play well , but deep down i know it 's a process and i 've got some work to do			2
@entity8 looks on as @entity12 celebrates becoming @entity51 champion earlier this month ' i 'm probably a little more relaxed with things now than i was say 10 years ago when i was trying to find my game			1
i would say that i 'm more comfortable in my own skin and what i do out here on tour is just kind of bonus			0
' i 've kind of relaxed my schedule the last few years , so that 's probably why i have this attitude about playing			0
i 'm much more excited to play when i do come to an event because i 'm not playing as much			2
i enjoy my time at home probably more so because i 'm spending bigger blocks of time at home			0
@entity31 ( right ) is making his way back to full fitness after back surgery last december and will also play in the @entity4 ' so right now i have really the best of both worlds and that 's what i 'll continue to do all the way up to the senior tour when i start playing some of that			1
' i 'm still very competitive though			0
i say i 'm pretty relaxed and casual with things			0
but when it comes down to it , i really still want to win again and play well and maybe make another team event before all is said and done			0
so i still have some drive in there			0

@entity0 finished *runner* - up in @entity51 earlier this month
@entity8 was joint - second with @entity11 behind @entity12
