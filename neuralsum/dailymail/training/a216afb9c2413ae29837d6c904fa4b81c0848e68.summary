by @entity0 and @entity1 in @entity2 @entity4 ’s father is demanding that his daughter 's body is exhumed after he ordered a toxicology report that left him fearing she and her husband had been poisoned to death			1
@entity10 has said he is ' pushing and pushing and pushing ' the @entity12 office to exhume the bodies of the tragic @entity15 actress , who died aged 32 in december 2009 , and her husband @entity16 , who died just five months later aged 40			1
a family source told @entity18 today : ' @entity10 says that he sent letters to the @entity12 office , he says he 's sent them the report , but he 's heard nothing back '			1
according to @entity2 law , the next of kin of the deceased can order an exhumation to be carried out privately at their own cost , but the source said : ' @entity10 has spent a fortune on the case so far and is waiting for the @entity12 office to get involved , but he knows this may have to be done privately if the coroner does n't give him any satisfactory answers			1
he 's working on getting it done			2
' today , @entity16 's mother @entity37 , who continues to be haunted by her son 's death , told @entity18 : ' i would n't be a bit surprised if they exhumed @entity4 , i 've been hearing talk of this for months			1
' it 's very difficult to know how you deal with it anymore			0
will we ever get any answers about @entity16 and @entity4 ? no - one will help me and i just want to find out what happened			1
' the toxicology test @entity10 did - and it 's awful result - has spurred him on to want to do more and i 'm not surprised at all that he wants to exhume @entity4			1
' mr @entity10 has teamed up with filmmaker @entity66 , the wife of his business partner - and both believe that @entity4 and @entity16 were poisoned			1
they fear @entity4 was targeted by shadowy government agents for offering her support to @entity71 , a @entity73 ' whistleblower '			1
last november , a startling report claimed that @entity4 did not die from natural causes - despite the fact by the @entity2 coroner originally attributed her death to pneumonia and anemia			1
her husband died in may 2010 at their @entity83 home reputedly from the same causes			2
the star 's father mr @entity10 , 87 , finally secured the release of his daughter 's hair , blood and tissue samples for testing after years of litigation and submitted them for independent testing			1

' if we were to eliminate the possibility of a simultaneous accidental heavy metals exposure to the sample donor then the only logical explanation would be an exposure to these metals ( toxins ) administered by a third party perpetrator with likely criminal intent , ' the report stated			1
heavy metals are found in most rodenticides and insecticides meaning the actress could have been slipped rat poisoning or bug killer			1
at the time of her death , @entity4 displayed all the symptoms of heavy metal poisoning including : headaches , dizziness , abdominal cramps , coughing , sweating , disorientation , wheezing , congestion and pneumonia			1
mr @entity10 told the family source that @entity66 is ' the one who is following things up for us			2
' ' we do n’t have any concrete information on @entity4 and @entity16 being exhumed , but she ’s trying			1
we have no co-operation at this point from the @entity145			0
they say the case is closed , but it ’s not closed			0
they ’re liars , they ’ve had every report we ’ve given them			0
there ’s a cover up somewhere			0
‘ @entity153 refuse to co-operate , why should we go privately ? we ’re working on getting it done			0
they have to co-operate with us , period			0
that ’s going to happen			0
we want to force them to do it , they should do it			0
there ’s a cover up somewhere			0
why should i let them get away with this ? they ’re going to have admit they ’re wrong			0
i ’m taking a stand on this and all the things they ’re saying are false			0
' we ’re on top of it , we ’ll see where it goes , it ’s in their ballpark , but we ’re trying , just watch this space , ' he claimed			0

' @entity10 has relocated to @entity221 in his old age to claim he is here for @entity4 , as he never was in life			2
he has made outrageous statements over the past few years , culminating in this latest madness : that my darling daughter was murdered			0
' @entity205 - who now lives in seclusion in @entity2 - said : ' his claims are based on the most flimsy of evidence and are more of an insult than an insight into what really happened			0
' @entity37 ( left ) said nobody has answered any of her questions about her son 's death , and the coroner 's officer only did the most basic of tests suspicions : @entity37 ( right ) talked about her suspicions regarding her son 's death after @entity4 's father , @entity10 ( left ) , publicly said that he believed the actress ' support of @entity66 , left , in her border guard whistleblowing case was behind the mysterious and tragic deaths today , a spokesman for the @entity251 said : ‘ there are private companies and pathologists out there who do perform the exhumation			1
t ' this can be close to the death itself or years after the the death			0
one of the more popular companies is 1 800 autopsy , a lot of people go to them looking for a second opinion , if they 're looking at medical malpractice or just want another opinion			0
' the companies have got business contracts to do this - it ’s a matter entirely between them and the family			0
once the body leaves this office , we have no jurisdiction or control over it			0
