@entity1 's recent attempt to stop her mother 's letters from being auctioned off is just her latest effort to stop others from profiting off her family 's legacy			2
@entity1 , who is the sole surviving member of former president @entity9 's direct family , stopped a batch of letters that her mother sent to an @entity14 priest from being sold at auction last month on the grounds that she has inherited her mother 's copyright and therefore owns the letters that were sent to father @entity20			1
' the family got fed up of everybody making money off of the @entity27 , ' author @entity21 , who wrote a book called the @entity23 , told the @entity28			0
not for sale : a set of letters @entity9 wrote to a catholic priest in @entity14 have been pulled from auction after @entity34 received complaints from the former first lady 's family ' they want the control			1
. they ’re very protective , and they feel these repulsive journalists are trying to say anything to make a buck			0
that ’s not totally untrue			0
' now more details have been revealed about how she was able to put an end to the sale , which would have helped a local college stay afloat during tough financial times			0
the specific contents of the letters have been kept under wraps but they were sent from @entity9 over the span of 15 years following the first time she met father @entity20 during a trip to @entity60 in 1950			1
in the 33 newly - discovered handwritten letters , amounting to some 130 pages , the famously tight - lipped mrs @entity9 writes freely of her suspicions about @entity65 ’s fidelity , her reservations over his frightening ambition and her utter loneliness and anger at his tragic death			1
father @entity20 worked at @entity34 in @entity60 , and the cash - strapped college found the letters in his belongings that he had gifted to the school when he died			1
fast friends : @entity9 first met father @entity20 on a trip to @entity60 in 1950			1
he chaperoned her during the trip , taking her to the theatre and out to the city 's finest @entity83 restaurant more roles : @entity1 serves as the protector of her family 's legacy but she also is now the @entity89 ambassador to @entity90 , seen here at an event in @entity92 last week with actor @entity93 and the prime minister 's wife @entity94 in correspondence before and after she joined her husband in the @entity97 , she admitted the rising political star was consumed by ambition ‘ like @entity101 ’			0
writing in 1953 — the year they married — she said that politicians were ‘ a breed apart ’ but admitted that she too was vulnerable to their craving for attention			0
because the sale has been cancelled , the school will not receive the windfall from the auction which was expected to net about $ 4million , and they have been forced to close after 172 years			2
the sale raised legal question of ownership , however , because even if the letters themselves were the property of the priest , who then passed that property on to the school , he never legally had the copyright to the material in the letters			2
that copyright is generally believed to belong to the author themselves , which would be @entity9 in this case			0
when she died in 1994 , her will mandated that the copyright to all of her writings would fall in the hands of her two children			0
' i request , but do not direct , my children to respect my wish for privacy , ' her will stated			0
longstanding friendship : father @entity20 and @entity9 , pictured in 1950 during their initial meeting , corresponded faithfully over the course of 15 years when @entity143 died in 1999 , @entity1 was given control of both of their estates			1
in the latest drama surrounding the end of the @entity14 auction , the sellers did not immediately announce who put an end to the sale , saying only that members of the @entity9 family complained			1
now the @entity28 has revealed that @entity9 family attorneys contacted @entity159 's @entity158 on may 21 saying that the sale could not go forward on the grounds that they own the copyright			1
' it ’s @entity1 ’s decision about what should happen ... whatever she would suggest i would agree to , ' @entity9 's stepbrother @entity165 told @entity167			2
@entity1 , who is now serving as the @entity89 ambassador to @entity90 , has taken a hands - on role in the release of her mother 's private thoughts			0
the clearest example comes when an oral history mrs @entity9 made was first not going to be released until 75 years after her death , but then @entity1 surrepticiously released a book in 2011 detailing the transcriptions .			2

the sale of 130 pages of letters written by the former first lady to father @entity20 was called off after the @entity9 family *intervened*
lawyers for the family contacted the @entity14 auction house and *argued* that @entity1 owns the copyright to the letters
the letters themselves *technically* belonged to the priest , who gifted his belongings after his death to @entity34 , where he taught
but because @entity9 wrote the words in the letters , that falls under her copyright which is now controlled by her *daughter* @entity1
@entity34 was *hoping* to make about $ 4million from the sale which would have kept them open but now the school is shutting down
