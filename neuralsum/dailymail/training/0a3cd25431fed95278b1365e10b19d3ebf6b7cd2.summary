by @entity0 the @entity1 voted last night on an extension of the @entity3 , which could cover middle - class elderly people elderly people paying for their own care could be protected under the same human rights laws as those who receive @entity11 care , after a landmark vote in the @entity1 last night			1
under the current system , people whose care is funded by the @entity11 may sue care homes on human rights grounds if they are treated badly			1
last night ’s ‘ unprecedented ’ decision to support an extension of the @entity3 could cover middle - class elderly people who live in private care homes or pay to be looked after			1
@entity1 voted by 247 to 218 to support a move that would ensure even people who paid for their own care would be covered by the @entity3			1
the amendment to the @entity25 was backed by a majority of 29 despite health minister @entity27 arguing it was ‘ neither necessary or appropriate ’			0
he said the @entity3 dealt with public functions – the ‘ interface between the individual and the state ’			2
and he said if the amendment was agreed ‘ it would represent an unprecedented change to the scope of the @entity3 ’			2
‘ for the first time , it would capture purely private arrangements such as a privately arranged social care contract between a private care home and a private individual – an arrangement in which there is no state involvement at all , ’ he said			1
independent crossbencher @entity47 of @entity49 , who proposed the report stage amendment , said that following a 2007 court case – yl against @entity53 – there had been uncertainty over whether care home services provided by the private sector under contract with a local authority were covered by the @entity3			1
@entity1 voted 247 to 218 to support a move that would ensure even people who paid for their own care would be covered by the act he said his amendment would settle the matter and ‘ include those who are eligible for care but who , due to means testing , have to arrange and / or pay for the own care – so called self - funders ’ currently not covered under human rights laws			1
the amendment would ‘ provide equal protection to all users of regulated social care , regardless of where that care is provided and who is paying for it ’			2
the amendment to the @entity25 was backed by a majority of 29 he added : ‘ surely it is right to take this opportunity of putting the matter beyond doubt			0
’ @entity90 , supporting the amendment , told peers that the @entity92 said people who provided this type of care ‘ should consider themselves bound by the @entity3 ’			1
but he said the position should be made clear			0
labour former health minister lord @entity98 pointed to the case of a woman who had been paying for herself in a care home			0
‘ she had the temerity to air her views on assisted dying which did n’t please some of the staff , ’ he said			0
‘ she did n’t seek anybody ’s help to commit suicide , she just expressed her views			0
‘ the home ’s management gave her four weeks ’ notice to leave the home as a result			0
‘ when her son raised the issue of her rights under the @entity3 with legal counsel , the opinion he was given was that she lacked protection under the act because she was not in receipt of a service from a body providing a function of a public nature because her placement was neither in a publicly provided or publicly funded home			2
’ he called for @entity131 to provide self - funders with the ‘ legal certainty that other elderly people have when they are having domiciliary care or residential care ’ .			0
