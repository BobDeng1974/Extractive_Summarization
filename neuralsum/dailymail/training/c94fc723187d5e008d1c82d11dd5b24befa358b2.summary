a group of kayakers on the @entity2 in @entity3 got a surprise when they were joined by a lost seal who found himself nearly 100 miles from home			1
the misplaced mammal is remarkably thought to have negotiated at least three locks at @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , and around three weirs to get so far upstream from the @entity14			1
but the seal did n't seem too worried about where he was and playfully swam alongside the kayakers for half an hour			1
tasty treat : the lost seal found himself nearly 100 miles from his normal home having swam up the @entity2 at the weekend			1
he did n't seem too worried though and tucked in to this salmon near @entity22 chomp ! totally oblivious that he was 75 miles upstream from the mouth of the @entity2 , the mammal created quite a stir among kayakers and passers - by in @entity22 @entity31 journey : the harbour seal had negotiated a number of locks and weirs to get so far up the river the harbour seal - more naturally at home in the @entity39 - had followed boats in its journey to the @entity42 after it got lost while hunting for fish			1
it was snapped in the river catching and eating a salmon by @entity47 , 62 , on saturday afternoon			2
he said : ' i managed to squeeze between the trees and get a few pictures , when i dashed down to the river 's edge it was gently bobbing along with the fish and struggling to consume it			2
' it was quite an incredible sight and not something you 're ever likely to see in landlocked @entity22			1
' long way from home : the seal negotiated a route full of locks and weir ( including at @entity66 and @entity67 ) on the @entity2 from @entity10 up to @entity22 where am i ? it is believed that the seal followed a boat while hunting for fish and ended up 75 miles inland hiding away : the seal takes a break from all the adulation			1
he had earlier swam playfully alongside a group of kayakers near @entity22 @entity77 , 53 , was among the friends from @entity79 and @entity80 who had a close encounter with the seal			1
she said : ' he was diving under our boats , playing under the waves , doing tumble turns and showing us his spotty belly			2
' it ’s just so exciting , to see something so unusual , especially with the kids , it just blew them away			0
' the seal was also spotted the next day tucking into fish nearby by dog - walker @entity94			2
@entity94 added : ' it had a big fish in its mouth			0
' there were a lot of people stood watching and taking pictures - as it ’s not something you usually see			0
' bobbing and biting : the harbour seal was able to find a tasty salmon to feast upon so far up river battle : it did look as though the seal was struggling to subdue his catch @entity113 , an animal care assistant at the @entity115 , said it was very rare to see seals so far inland			1
he said : ' it is likely that the seal has come from @entity39 or @entity120 seas			2
' although it is not unusual for seals to swim upriver - it is highly unusual for them to come this far inland			0
' chances are he has followed fish up the river and with quite strong spring tides this year he has probably come up further than usual			0
' either that or he is a young juvenile who is just inexperienced - either way as long as he has a good feed he should n’t be in any danger			0
' it also pretty rare for them to get this close and personal with people as they can notoriously be antisocial animals			0
' an @entity140 spokesman said : ' seals do n’t tend to stay long and will eventually make their own way out			0
' there is usually no reason for us to intervene unless the animal is injured , sick or distressed			0
' people should just enjoy observing him as he wo n’t be there long			0
