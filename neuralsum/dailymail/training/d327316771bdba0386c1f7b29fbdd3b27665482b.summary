experts have managed to solve one of the biggest problems blighting @entity3 living at the @entity4 - creating a real ale that can survive the extreme cold at the world 's most inhospitable place			1
brewers have now produced a special version of the @entity3 staple , which can now withstand temperatures of down to minus 90 degrees @entity14 and the 10,000 mile journey from the @entity3			1
previously ales brought there could not cope with the low temperatures on @entity19 , as it would freeze and kills its taste			1
problem solved : explorer @entity23 will be one of those enjoying the special beer that can withstand the coldest place on @entity28 - the @entity4 this special beer - called @entity29 - is due to be shipped 10,000 miles to the @entity31 continent on the planet this week for engineers and scientists working there to enjoy			1
the ale , which has a secret recipe , is currently being put into plastic bottles , which will then have the air squeezed out of them			1
the process allows the liquid to expand when frozen and prevents the vital gas from escaping			0
after it reaches its destination it will be kept safe until christmas day when a team of explorers will drink it as part of their celebrations			0
freezing : ale could not cope with the extreme temperatures but pole - axed stays liquid down to minus 90 degrees @entity14 winding down : until now @entity3 have been unable to enjoy ale while working near the @entity4 because it would freeze and lose its taste propping up the bar : at last the beer can be enjoyed on @entity19 , which is being shipped in special vacuum packed bottles @entity63 and @entity64 developed the drink at the @entity67 ’s @entity66			1
the pair spent a painstaking month fermenting the beer , which is based on a 200 - year - old @entity70 , @entity70			2
their recipe includes hops imported from the @entity74 of @entity75 and is fruity to the taste			2
@entity63 , from @entity77 , said the secret to its success was its 6.7 per cent alcohol content			2
the 32 - year - old explained : ' we were asked to brew the beer by some of the members of the @entity86 who are regulars in the pub. ' we ’ve never been asked to do anything like it before but we decided it would be fun and we ’d give it a go			2
' the beer had to withstand the a long journey and freezing temperatures so we agreed it must be strong			1
merry fellows : ( left / right ) @entity64 , @entity23 and @entity63 enjoy a quick pint of the beer in the @entity67 , in @entity77 , where the beer is produced ' we looked at 200 - year - old @entity70 recipes for inspiration because those beers were created to survive being exported all the way to @entity105			1
' our final recipe includes special hops that have been imported from @entity75 , which give it a fruity taste			0
' it took 10 hours to brew and then we left it for a month to ferment , during that time i had to check it every day to make sure it was right			0
' he added : ' when it was finished we let the guys from the @entity119 test it and it went down really well			0
we ’re really pleased with the result			0
a team from the @entity123 and the @entity124 will be conducting research at @entity126 for three months			0
mine 's a pint : the beer will be sent the 10,000 miles to the southern continent , pictured , which is the coldest place on earth they wanted a special pint for their hard work - but it would have to survive the long and freezing journey to the @entity19			1
@entity23 , from the @entity124 in @entity77 , is one of the team who will be enjoying the beer in @entity19			1
the engineer said : ' the project at @entity126 is extremely big so a beer will be well deserved at the end of it			0
' we ’ve never asked a brewer to do this kind of thing before but we thought it would be a nice idea			0
' i ’ve had a taste of it already and it ’s a brilliant beer			2
it will be a great treat for christmas day			0

until now ales could not cope with the cold as it would lose its *delicious* taste
new beer @entity161 has been *invented* and brewers say it will survive the freezing conditions and long journey
engineers working on @entity19 asked a @entity77 *micro-brewery* to produce it for them as they missed the @entity3 *favourite*
the beer will travel the 10,000 miles in vacuum - packed plastic bottles
