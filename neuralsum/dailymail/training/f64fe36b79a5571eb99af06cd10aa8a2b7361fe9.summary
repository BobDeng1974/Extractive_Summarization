by @entity0 @entity1 was booed by @entity3 fans on his return to @entity5 for the first time as @entity8 manager - then saw his side comfortably beaten			1
he endured a miserable day as the home side won 2 - 0 thanks to a @entity13 penalty and a goal by @entity15 before half - time and there were gleeful chants of , ' you 're getting sacked in the morning ' from the @entity3 supporters			1
@entity1 afterwards called his centre half @entity22 ' stupid ' after the defender gave away the penalty for handball in the first half but also bizarrely claimed that his side controlled the game			1
but we passed brilliantly and kept control of the game , but we could n’t create enough chances			2
‘ it was a stupid decision to dive in front of the ball [ @entity3 penalty ] and they were two stupid goals to concede on the break			1
‘ we played very well first half , we passed really well			0
it was disappointment how we played in the final third though			0
‘ i could n’t fault how we played , we kept the ball incredibly well			0
' @entity8 will not feature in the @entity80 next season and may not even make the @entity81 after another debilitating defeat			0
@entity1 added : ‘ it does hurt , we want to be in @entity80 and we must get back into it as quickly as we can			2
we are building behind the scenes now and are looking to return			0
’ @entity87 penalty : the ball strikes @entity22 on the hand , prompting referee @entity90 to award a penalty paying the penalty : @entity13 drives home the spot - kick to score @entity3 's opener @entity95 feeling blue again : @entity39 , another former @entity3 man , looks downcast after the opener signing in : @entity98 gives fans his autograph on his arrival at @entity5 read the match report from @entity5 here @entity1 spent 11 years in charge at @entity3 and his reign was largely thought to be a success , although that opinion seems to have been partly revised owing to their superb season under his successor @entity33			1
the @entity110 also got on the wrong side of the @entity3 when he bid for @entity13 in the summer and , eventually , bought @entity61 , and that may have prompted the fans ' abuse outisde the ground and as he walked out of the tunnel			1
chairman @entity117 - a stauch ally of @entity1 's during his time in charge at @entity5 - has made no comment , while @entity33 dedicates just a paragraph to his predecessor			1
however , @entity3 club captain @entity123 wrote in his programme column before the match : ' today was never going to be an ordinary game between us			2
the return to @entity5 of our former boss and some of his staff undoubtedly adds to the occasion			0
' @entity1 brought me to @entity3 and i 'll always be grateful to him for that			1
in my opinion , he did a fantastic job at this club and nobody begrudged him the move to @entity8			0
' it will be nice to see him again today and of course it will be good to see @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , not to mention @entity61 ! ' all we are focusing on as players is the three points			0
' thanks for the support : @entity3 striker @entity150 signs autographs ahead of the match @entity33 admitted that he was grateful to @entity1 for the job he had done before him at @entity3 but also felt for the fans who gave the @entity110 a less than welcome reception			1
' now , obviously , he is the @entity8 manager and there is a big rivalry fighting for the same aims as @entity3 so you can expect that it is going to be a very much competitive atmosphere here , ' he said			2
' but everyone knows the job that @entity1 did at @entity3 will never be forgotten and clearly i will have a lot to thank him ( for )			2
' the @entity166 was happy with the workrate of his players as they overcame a @entity8 side that had far more possession			1
' we knew that we were facing a very good side , ' he added			0
' away from home they have a terrific record and in that respect we had three games in eight days and it was important that we were focused and we were very clear in what we wanted to do and i think we did that			0
' we controlled the aspects of the game that we wanted to do			0
' i thought we were electrifying on the counter attack and i thought the way that we got in the final third was very enjoyable from that respect and then we worked extremely hard to keep a clean sheet			0
' the way we were : @entity1 ( centre ) waves to the fans after walking through the guard of honour after his final match in charge of @entity3			1

@entity1 back at @entity3 for first time since leaving for @entity8
he saw his side lose 2 - 0 thanks to @entity13 and @entity15
