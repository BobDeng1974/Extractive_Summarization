there medics told @entity6 and @entity7 were told their son had dilated cardiomyopathy and that his organ was operating at just 17 per cent of its normal function			2
the condition means he desperately needs a heart transplant			2

he was critically ill and they ( @entity36 ) sent us away telling us he had tonsillitis			2
@entity7 with her critically - ill son @entity9			1
he has dilated cardiomyopathy which means his heart ca n't pump blood efficiently ' @entity9 was unresponsive and sick at the clinic and he had terrible breathing problems			1
' we are just so angry and disappointed that we put our trust in the system - we should have just gone straight to @entity48			2
' mr @entity33 said he and @entity7 initially called the out - of - hours service , run by @entity50 , and were told to take distressed @entity9 to the minor injuries unit , where he was misdiagnosed			1
his heart had to be restarted after he went to intensive care at @entity53 , before he was transferred the the specialist @entity22 in @entity23			2
however , the family 's problems continued after he was transferred back to a general ward at @entity11 after showing a slight improvement			1
mr @entity33 , a father - of - four said : ' when he came back to @entity11 they put him in a bay with 12 other kids			2
' he was supposed to be in isolation because he had been transferred from another hospital			0
three days later he had got much worse but the whole day only one nurse came to check on him			0
' my wife and i kept asking if a doctor was coming to see him but they never did			0
by 5am the next morning he was so poorly they decided to do @entity69 and put him back on a ventilator before transferring him back to @entity23			0
' his heart function when he got back to the @entity22 was only seven per cent			0
' he was in a critical condition and we were told he might not survive			0
' battling @entity9 managed to pull through as his exhausted parents feared the worst but they now face a long tortuous wait for a new heart			1
doctors have told them the tot could have an eight - hour operation to fit a @entity84 artificial heart is used to help bridge the gap until a suitable heart is found for transplant			0
' at the moment @entity9 is stable , ' said mr @entity33 , who works for a cleaning contractors at @entity53			1
