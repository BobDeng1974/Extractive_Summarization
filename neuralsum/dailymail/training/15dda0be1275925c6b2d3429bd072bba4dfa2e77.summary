@entity0 hailed the d - day landings as the ‘ most complicated and difficult ’ operation ever launched , even as troops were still battling up the @entity5 beaches			1
with the invasion still underway , the prime minister updated mps on the ambitious battle plan ‘ to furnish the enemy with a succession of surprises ’			1
but mr @entity0 revealed how an ‘ immense armada ’ of more than 4,000 ships and several thousand smaller craft had launched the ‘ liberating assault ’ on the northern coast of @entity32			1
‘ this vast operation is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever occurred ’ , he said			1
‘ the battle that has now begun will grow constantly in scale and in intensity for many weeks to come and i shall not attempt to speculate upon its course			1
’ @entity40 on june 6 , 1944 was the beginning of an 80 - day campaign to liberate the region which involved three million troops and cost the lives of 250,000			2
mr @entity0 ’s statement also included news of the liberation of @entity48 : ‘ a memorable and glorious event , which rewards the intense fighting of the last five months in @entity51			1
’ but the focus was on the events which were still unfolding in @entity32 , as thousands of troops made their way across the @entity56 by sea and by air			1
‘ it involves tides , wind , waves , visibility , both from the air and the sea standpoint , and the combined employment of land , air and sea forces in the highest degree of intimacy and in contact with conditions which could not and can not be fully foreseen , ’ mr @entity0 said			2
‘ there are already hopes that actual tactical surprise has been attained , and we hope to furnish the enemy with a succession of surprises during the course of the fighting			1
’ at the time the wartime coalition government reported that obstacles and mines in the sea had not proved as deadly as anticipated			2
@entity0 described how the vast operation was ' undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever occurred ' @entity85 was updated on the landings even as @entity87 from the 1st @entity88 waded ashore @entity0 said an ' immense armada ' of thousands of ships was supporting the @entity26 forces the @entity92 , @entity94 , @entity32 and @entity95 troops who parachuted into enemy lines had successfully ‘ quelled ’ enemy fire			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ the @entity98 are sustained by about 11,000 first line aircraft , which can be drawn upon as may be needed for the purposes of the battle			1
’ to applause from mps , he concluded : ‘ nothing that equipment , science or forethought could do has been neglected , and the whole process of opening this great new front will be pursued with the utmost resolution both by the commanders and by the @entity94 and @entity92 governments whom they serve			2
’ in response @entity114 , the leader of the opposition during the @entity115 , said the outbreak of applause was a sign of ‘ gratitude to all those who have bled and fought in the battles in @entity51 ’			2
he added : ‘ now that our @entity124 there are on the march , it will not be long before the @entity128 invader is turned out of that peninsula			0
we are living through momentous hours			2
’ mr @entity114 went on : ‘ there is nothing much that we can do , except to pledge ourselves , and to pledge our physical and spiritual resources , to the unstinted aid of the men and women who are serving overseas ; to let them know the pride that we shall feel in their victories and the sadness that we shall feel about their losses			0
’ thousands of troops parachuting into enemy lines had successfully ' quelled ' @entity128 batteries communist mp @entity145 said : ‘ this is one of the most solemn moments in the life of this @entity85 , and it is certainly not a time for making , or trying to make , speeches , but i should like to express my own feeling			1
‘ and i am sure the feeling of every @entity153 , that our hearts and our thoughts are with these lads who have gone across to the @entity157 and with their mothers here at home			0
’ @entity161 mp @entity160 urged mr @entity0 to send a message ‘ to the people of @entity32 at this moment … directly from the representatives of the @entity92 people to the people of @entity32 ’			1
mr @entity0 pledged to keep mps updated on the progress of the landings , and returned to deliver a second statement that evening			1
having spent the day listening to the latest communications from the front , he revealed the operation was ‘ proceeding in thoroughly satisfactory manner ’			1
he claimed that ‘ many dangers and difficulties which at this time last night appeared extremely formidable are behind us ’			0
he suggested that the @entity179 had been completed ‘ with far less loss than we apprehended ’ and the @entity182 had been successful in weakening the @entity128 batteries			0
he went on : ‘ the landings along the whole front have been effective , and our troops have penetrated , in some cases , several miles inland			0
@entity188 exist on a broad front			0
’ opposition leader @entity114 said @entity92 was ' living through momentous hours ' while @entity161 mp @entity160 urged mr @entity0 to send a message of solidarity to the people of @entity32 the ‘ outstanding feature ’ had been the troops parachuted into @entity128 lines ‘ on a scale far larger than anything that has been seen so far in the world ’			1
despite fears about the weather , and concerns that visibility would be poor , ‘ these landings took place with extremely little loss and with great accuracy ’ he said			0
as details emerged of progress being made along the beaches and into key towns , mr @entity0 said several bridges had been captured			2
but he warned : ‘ all this , although a very valuable first step - a vital and essential first step - gives no indication of what may be the course of the battle in the next days and weeks , because the enemy will now probably endeavour to concentrate on this area			1
‘ in that event heavy fighting will soon begin and will continue without end , as we can push troops in and he can bring other troops up			1
it is , therefore , a most serious time that we enter upon			0
‘ thank @entity227 , we enter upon it with our great allies all in good heart and all in good friendship			0
’ play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video @entity250 and @entity0 visiting troops in @entity5 i have to announce to the @entity253 that during the night and the early hours of this morning the first of the series of landings in force upon the @entity157 has taken place			2
in this case the liberating assault fell upon the coast of @entity32			1
an immense armada of upwards of 4,000 ships , together with several thousand smaller craft , crossed the @entity56			1
massed airborne landings have been successfully effected behind the enemy lines and landings on the beaches are proceeding at various points at the present time			0
the fire of the shore batteries has been largely quelled			0
the obstacles that were constructed in the sea have not proved so difficult as was apprehended			0
the @entity98 are sustained by about 11,000 first line aircraft , which can be drawn upon as may be needed for the purposes of the battle			1
i can not , of course , commit myself to any particular details			2
reports are coming in in rapid succession			0
so far the @entity284 who are engaged report that everything is proceeding according to plan			0
and what a plan ! this vast operation is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever occurred			2
it involves tides , wind , waves , visibility , both from the air and the sea standpoint , and the combined employment of land , air and sea forces in the highest degree of intimacy and in contact with conditions which could not and can not be fully foreseen			0
there are already hopes that actual tactical surprise has been attained , and we hope to furnish the enemy with a succession of surprises during the course of the fighting			2
the battle that has now begun will grow constantly in scale and in intensity for many weeks to come and i shall not attempt to speculate upon its course			1
this i may say , however			0
complete unity prevails throughout the @entity321			0
there is a brotherhood in arms between us and our friends of the @entity94			0
there is complete confidence in the supreme commander , @entity250 , and his lieutenants , and also in the commander of the @entity331 , @entity330			0
the ardour and spirit of the troops , as i saw myself , embarking in these last few days was splendid to witness			0
nothing that equipment , science or forethought could do has been neglected , and the whole process of opening this great new front will be pursued with the utmost resolution both by the commanders and by the @entity94 and @entity92 governments whom they serve .			0
