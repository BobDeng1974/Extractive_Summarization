@entity0 believes he will be better equipped to cope with the pressure of trying to win the masters after coming close to creating history last year			1
@entity0 held a two - shot lead after seven holes of the final round 12 months ago as he looked to surpass the absent @entity7 as the youngest ever @entity8 champion , as well as being the first player to win on their tournament debut since @entity12 in 1979			1
that lead became a two - shot deficit as he bogeyed the eighth and ninth and @entity14 birdied the same holes , @entity14 eventually going on to win his second green jacket in the space of three years			2
@entity0 plays a shot during a practice round at @entity20 on tuesday as he gears up for the masters @entity0 believes he is better equipped to win the first major of the year after coming close on his debut in 2014 the 21 - year - old skims a ball across a lake at @entity20 during a relaxed practice round @entity0 finished joint second with @entity31 's @entity30 and comes into this year 's event having won his second @entity34 title in the @entity35 and finishing second in his next two tournaments			1
speaking about last year 's final round , the 21 - year - old said : ' that was definitely the highest amount of pressure i 've ever felt			1
that first tee shot , i think i hit it into the ninth fairway and was just real quick off the tee			0
played pretty much the entire round feeling different than i 've ever felt on the golf course			0
' i enjoyed it , but at the same time when you 're feeling that kind of pressure , it 's hard to get comfortable picking fearless shots , and then i kind of bailed out on a couple of swings , trying to look up a little quickly			0
' i guess the hardest lesson taken from last year was that i had an opportunity to make a dream come true , and i had it in my hands , and then i was just a little anxious			0
you can make the excuse that as a first - timer and 20 years old , that that 's likely to happen			2
@entity0 , pictured in action at last year 's masters , threw away a two - shot lead to finish joint second in 2014 @entity14 hugs @entity0 after tapping in to win his second green jacket at @entity20 last year ' but in my mind , i was playing the best through 61 holes and had an opportunity to continue that the next 11 holes and did n't quite close it out			1
' @entity0 , who has been paired with @entity74 and @entity75 for the first two rounds , added : ' last year i remember being in here saying i had no expectations , did n't know what it was going to be like , never played the tournament before			1
' this year , i come in maybe expecting to play well on a course i feel very comfortable on			0
i feel like it suits my game nicely and also i feel like i 've been playing well			0
' having been so close last year and having a little experience and riding some momentum , i hope to put myself in contention and use what i 've learned since last year			0
' i think last year 's event , i certainly took a couple things out of it , as well as the positives that came from closing out a couple of tournaments at the end of the year and a few weeks ago			2

@entity0 finished joint second on his @entity8 debut last year
