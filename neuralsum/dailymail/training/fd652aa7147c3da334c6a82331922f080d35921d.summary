i do n’t know about you , but i find this time of year a bit of a struggle			0
the fun and frolics of @entity7 are over , and it ’s back to work – getting up and going home in pitch darkness , and battling through the cold , wind and rain just to grab a pint of milk from the shop			0
if i had my way , i ’d burrow down under the duvet and hibernate til the spring sunshine makes an appearance			0
i ’ve created a quick and easy make - up regime that will have you have you looking fresh - faced and gorgeous in a flash – just the thing to brighten up those dark winter days			1
step 1 : the base chilly weather and central heating are a dehydrating double - whammy for your complexion , so this is a good moment to invest in a decent foundation			1
@entity39 gives excellent full coverage , evening out dry , dull winter skin without feeling greasy or cakey – i applied it with a foundation brush to achieve a professional finish			1
@entity21 begins with a correcting concealer as a quick fix for any blemishes @entity7 indulgences often lead to blemishes , so i also used a touch of @entity50 to disguise any spots and under - eye shadows			1
this product has a lovely creamy consistency , making it easy to blend , but if your concealer is a little hard , you ’ll find that applying it with your fingertips helps as the heat from your hands will warm and soften the formula			0
a dusting of translucent powder will fix everything in place – i used @entity67 , swept onto my forehead , cheeks and t - zone with a big fluffy brush			1
step 2 : cheeks and eyes i ’ve become a real fan of contouring powders			2
clever shading and highlighting can subtly alter your face shape , sharpening up those cheekbones and adding a glamorous dewy sheen that looks super-flattering			2
@entity21 uses contouring powders to sharpen her cheek bones for this quick look , i used the @entity85 made @entity87 palette , blending the contour shades under my cheekbones and dusting the highlight shades across my cheeks , forehead , nose and chin			1
sticking with the same palette for speed , i worked the same light shimmery shades all over my eyelids with a medium - size , flat brush , followed by applying the warmer shades along the crease of my eye to add definition			2
using a single palette for face and eyes really pulls your look together , as well as saving both time and money ! a few coats of @entity112 will add a polished finish to your eyes			2
work the brush from roots to tips , wiggling from side to side as you go to ensure each lash is fully coated with mascara			0
lips need extra care this time of years so @entity21 recommends opting for a tinted balm finally , use your fingertips to work a touch of @entity127 in @entity128 into your cheeks			1
winter complexions tend to look pale and washed - out , so blusher is a must at this time of year , and this lovely creamy formula is a welcome treat for your skin , too			2
step 3 : the lips the delicate skin on your lips is especially vulnerable at this time of year when the wind and cold can play havoc , so a hydrating and protective product is a great beauty investment			0
i slicked on a coat of @entity148 in @entity149			0
again , it ’s super-quick to apply , it gives a fresh shimmery finish , and ( best of all ) its rich , moisturizing formula will take care of your precious pout ! to get @entity21 ; s glamorous day - to - day look it only takes three simple steps and five minutes time ’s up ! three steps and five minutes from start to finish , and that pale creature that greeted you in the mirror when you woke up will be transformed into a glowing , fresh - faced beauty – a gorgeous ray of sunshine on a dreary winter day			1
