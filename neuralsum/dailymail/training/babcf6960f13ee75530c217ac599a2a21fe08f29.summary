by @entity0 will @entity1 retain the @entity2 ? @entity1 boss @entity3 has hailed the attitude of @entity5 after the @entity6 scored the decisive goal that lifted the @entity9 giants to @entity2 glory			1
with a pulsating final between city rivals @entity1 and @entity11 finely poised at 1 - 1 , @entity5 struck five minutes into the second period of extra time to break the hearts of the recently - crowned @entity17 champions			1
having missed several chances throughout normal time , including a clear cut opportunity when through on goal when the tie was still goalless , @entity5 held his nerve to steer a header into an empty net after @entity26 had seen his initial shot saved by @entity11 goalkeeper @entity28			1
' but he turned up when he was needed			2
' it is the second time that @entity5 has scored the winner in a cup final in his first season with @entity1 , with his solo goal against @entity49 in the @entity50 earning rave reviews			1
@entity5 's strikes in showpiece encounters will go a long way to silencing the critics that doubted his ability to live up to his world record Â£ 85.3million price tag , and @entity3 is confident the former @entity61 and @entity62 midfielder is capable of improvement			1
' all season @entity65 has been good and he will be better next year , ' @entity3 added			2
@entity6 pride : @entity5 ( centre ) became the first @entity6 to score in a @entity2 final @entity69 : @entity3 became the coach to deliver the fabled tenth @entity2 for @entity1 @entity72 's strike and @entity74 's penalty gave the scoreline a rather flattering look as @entity1 claimed a 4 - 1 victory and finally sealed the dream of ' @entity69 ' , their 10th @entity2 triumph			1
' we 're very proud of having won this for all @entity1 fans , ' @entity3 said			1
' happiness is giving happiness to those who always follow us			0
the fans are very happy and that makes us happy			0
' i have had a fantastic group of players who have always been professional and they showed that in this match too			0
not only those who were delighted to be playing , but also those who were not playing			0
' we 've worked hard this season to achieve this			0
' goals : @entity72 ( left ) and @entity74 ( right ) both scored crucial goals in extra-time @entity11 had looked on course for a famous double as , having wrapped up the @entity17 title last week , they took a 36th - minute lead on saturday night through @entity104 's header			1
yet their failure to double their lead ensured they were on the back foot for much of the final half hour and their defence was finally breached in the third minute of added - on time when @entity111 headed home from a corner			2
from then on , there was only going to be one winner , with several @entity11 players showing visible signs of fatigue , yet boss @entity119 , who was involved in an ugly on - field spat with @entity1 defender @entity121 before the final whistle , was proud of his players			1
' this fixture does n't deserve one tear , when you give your life , there 's nothing to say , ' he said			2
' it 's part of the game			0
you can win , you can lose			0
today we lost but know that we gave everything			0
that exalts us and gives us the ability to continue growing			0
' the @entity136 added : ' now we rest , we have summer to restart and work in the same way			0
angered : @entity119 ( centre ) lost his cool with @entity1 defender @entity121 ( second from right )			2

@entity1 beat @entity11 with goals from @entity111 , @entity5 , @entity72 and @entity74
coach @entity3 says that @entity5 ' turned up when needed '
@entity5 becomes first @entity6 to score in @entity2 final
@entity3 becomes the coach to secure @entity69 for @entity1
