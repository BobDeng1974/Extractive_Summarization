by @entity1 reporter published : 05:08 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 05:12 est , 11 july 2013 9/11 mastermind @entity2 , pictured after his 2003 capture , asked the @entity4 if he could keep himself occupied by designing a vacuum cleaner it sounds like something out of a @entity9 spy novel			1
confined to the basement of a @entity4 secret prison in @entity13 about a decade ago , @entity2 , the man who masterminded the 9/11 terrorist attacks , asked his jailers whether he could embark on an unusual project			1
would the spy agency allow @entity2 , who had earned his bachelor 's in mechanical engineering , to design a vacuum cleaner ? the agency officer in charge of the prison called @entity4 headquarters and a manager approved the request , a former senior @entity4 official told @entity1			1
@entity2 had endured the most brutal of the @entity4 's harsh interrogation methods and had confessed to a career of atrocities			1
but the agency had no long - term plan for him			0
someday , he might prove useful			0
perhaps , he 'd even stand trial one day			2
and for that , he 'd need to be sane			0
' we did n't want them to go nuts , ' the former senior @entity4 official said , one of several who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the now - closed @entity4 prisons or @entity2 's interest in vacuums			1
so , using schematics from the internet as his guide , @entity2 began re-engineering one of the most mundane of household appliances			2
the unusual activity is reminiscent of @entity9 's 1958 spy thriller @entity50 , where a vacuum salesman in @entity52 agrees to work for the @entity54 international spy service @entity53			0
he dupes the @entity54 into believing his vacuum designs are military installations			0
it is not known if @entity2 has ever read the novel			2
@entity2 graduated from @entity60 @entity59 with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1986			2
it 's not clear whether @entity2 was interested in designing a better vacuum or had ulterior motives			2
he might have intended to use the plans to conceal secret information or trick his jailers			0
it remains a mystery how far @entity2 got with his designs or whether the plans still exist			2
@entity2 's request to design a vacuum cleaner is reminiscent of @entity50 by @entity9 , pictured , where a vacuum salesman tricks @entity53 into thinking his appliance designs are intelligence @entity79 starred in the film adaptation of our man in @entity83 with @entity84 that the @entity4 may be in possession of the world 's most highly classified vacuum cleaner blueprints is but one peculiar , lasting byproduct of the controversial @entity91 detention and interrogation program			1
by the @entity4 's own account , the program 's methods were designed to psychologically ' dislocate ' people			2
but once interrogations stopped , the agency had to try to undo the psychological damage inflicted on the detainees			0
the @entity4 apparently succeeded in keeping @entity101			2
he appears to be in good health , according to military records			0
others have n't fared as well			0
accused @entity107 terrorists @entity108 and @entity109 , who were also locked up in @entity110 and @entity13 with @entity2 , have had mental issues			1
@entity112 suffers from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder			0
@entity108 is being treated for schizophrenia with a slew of anti-psychotic medications			0
' any type of prolonged isolation in custody - much less the settings described in the press - have been known to have a severe impact on the mental condition of the detainee , ' said @entity126 , @entity108 's former civilian lawyer			0
@entity126 declined to discuss @entity108 's case			0
@entity2 was subjected to harsh interrogations in @entity110			2
agency officers and contractors forced him to stay awake for 180 hours , according to a @entity4 inspector general 's report			1
he also underwent 183 instances of waterboarding , or simulated drowning			0
after the @entity4 prison in @entity110 was closed in september 2003 , @entity2 was moved to @entity137 , to a black site code - named ' @entity139			1
' soon the @entity4 was trying to find ways to entertain @entity2 as his intelligence value diminished			1
after detention in @entity13 , @entity2 was transferred to prison at the @entity91 naval base @entity144 in @entity52 ( file photo ) the prison had a debriefing room , where @entity2 , who saw himself as something of a professor , held ' office hours , ' as he told @entity4 officers			1
while chained to the floor , @entity2 would lecture the @entity4 officers on his path to jihad , his childhood and family			1
tea and cookies were served			2
along with the other five detainees at the prison in @entity137 , @entity2 was given assignments about his knowledge of @entity107 , or ' homework , ' as @entity4 officers called it			1
he was given @entity165 candy bars as rewards for his studiousness			1
in @entity13 , the prison provided books for detainees to read			1
@entity2 , former officials said , enjoyed the @entity172			1
for the @entity4 officers at the prison , not so much			1
for security reasons , after a prisoner finished a book , they tediously checked every page to ensure detainees were n't passing messages			0
they once caught @entity2 trying to hide a message in a book warning his prison mates not to talk about @entity187 's courier			1
the secret @entity4 prison in @entity13 was closed in early 2006 and @entity2 was transferred later that year to @entity190 prison , where he remains			1
it 's unlikely he was able to take his appliance plans to @entity52			0
@entity2 's military lawyer , @entity193 , said he was prohibited from discussing his client 's interest in vacuums			0
@entity2 admitted responsibility for a string of terror attacks across the world , including 9/11 ' it sounds ridiculous , but answering this question , or confirming or denying the very existence of a vacuum cleaner design , a @entity206 design , or even a design for a better hand towel would apparently expose the @entity91 government and its citizens to exceptionally grave danger , ' @entity193 said			1
but @entity193 added that he often discussed ' modern technological innovations ' and the ' scientific wonders ' of the @entity214 with @entity2			0
he called @entity215 ' exceptionally intelligent			0
' ' if he had access to educational programs in @entity144 , such as distance learning programs , i am confident that in addition to furthering his @entity222 studies , he could obtain a phd in mechanical engineering , and very likely patent inventions , ' @entity193 said			0
the @entity4 wo n't discuss @entity2 's vacuum plans , either			1
the @entity1 asked the @entity4 for copies of the vacuum designs or any government records about them under the @entity230			0
the @entity4 responded in a letter to the @entity1 that the records , ' should they exist , ' would be considered operational files of the @entity4 - among its most highly classified category of government files - and therefore exempt from ever being released to the public .			0

@entity2 made request while detained by @entity91 in @entity13
@entity4 needed to keep him ' sane ' after *torture* in case he faced trial one day
the qualified engineer needed to be ' entertained ' by intelligence agency
he held ' office hours ' for agents with tea and cookies in @entity137 prison
@entity2 was given @entity165 bars as reward for *co-operation* on @entity107
he also enjoyed the @entity172 series of books while behind bars
secret @entity4 prison closed in 2006 and @entity2 was sent to @entity144
