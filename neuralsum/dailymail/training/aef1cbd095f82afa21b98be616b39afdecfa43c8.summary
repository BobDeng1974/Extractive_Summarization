@entity0 is bracing himself for bad news			1
the euphoria generated by an @entity4 title triumph is in danger of being shattered by an almighty comedown this week			2
the grim reality of @entity9 ’s two - tier tour is becoming apparent and players are coming to terms with the consequences of an administrative shambles far beyond their control			1
arguably the most brutal selection of @entity17 ’s tenure looms			1
there are those who performed with distinction at @entity21 on saturday , as the depleted visitors came agonisingly close to shocking the @entity23 in the first test			1
fighting for his place : @entity0 runs with the ball during the @entity9 training session on monday men such as @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 are likely to be ‘ rewarded ’ for their sterling efforts by being removed from @entity9 ’s starting xv to make way for some influential reinforcements			1
the other category contains those players who arrived here late having taken part in the @entity4 final			2
@entity0 may be among that number			2
the @entity42 captain was in jubilant mood winning at @entity44 , but now the occasion may cost him the @entity9 no 2 shirt			1
training : @entity47 put through his paces ahead of saturday 's second showdown against @entity23 @entity50 : @entity51 runs with the ball during the training session at the @entity54 on monday history : @entity56 trains with @entity9 , who have won just twice on the @entity23 ' patch - in 1973 and 2003 round two : @entity9 prepare ahead of the second of their three - test series against the @entity23 pass : @entity61 back in training after overcoming an ankle injury that ruled him out first time around @entity64 of @entity65 was superb as @entity9 ’s starting hooker at @entity21 and has a strong chance of being retained for this saturday ’s second test in @entity69			1
@entity0 may have to patiently await the chance to reclaim his lost status and said : ‘ you just bide your time and wait for an opportunity and when it comes , you take it			2
that ’s what @entity64 ’s done			2
he waited for the opportunity and stepped up at the weekend			2
’ asked how he would respond , @entity0 quipped : ‘ well , i ca n’t go and take him down in training , ’ before adding : ‘ me and @entity81 have had it for two years now			2
you slip up , you give the other guy an opportunity			0
in my case , slipping up was having to stay behind to play a game			1
‘ @entity64 took an opportunity , he played well and i would n’t be surprised if we stick with him			0
there ’s the bigger picture as well			0
it ’s good for @entity81 and myself to know there ’s someone else who can step up in that position , it pushes us on			0
it ’s good for the team and with the @entity98 we ’re going to need three strong hookers			0
’ @entity0 ’s refusal to condemn the farcical circumstances is admirable			0
at least that showpiece final provided him with a high - stakes comeback from a shoulder injury and extra time also worked in his favour			1
close : @entity107 hopes to cause another upset - but this time with it ending in @entity9 victory working hard : @entity111 trains ahead of the second clash with @entity23 on saturday morning preparation : @entity114 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) return to training after the @entity4 final clash top team : @entity23 won all 14 of their matches in 2013 but @entity9 want to give them a dose of reality decisions : @entity17 must choose his side for the second test against @entity23 ‘ the game went for 100 minutes so i got 50 minutes in the end which was good preparation , ’ he added			1
‘ in terms of intensity and being in that environment , a @entity4 final with extra time set me up pretty well			0
i feel fit and strong , the shoulder is not giving me any gyp so i ’m ready			0
’ it may be that the most he is asked to do is take a place among the replacements , a fate which beckons at least one other late arrival who was so impressive during the @entity138 — @entity143			0
@entity0 warned that @entity9 must be wary of assuming the cavalry charge of reinforcements will lead to a rise in performance in @entity69			1
‘ @entity148 toured here last year — they were quite competitive in the first game , their top 14 finalists turned up and they got humped 30 - nil or something , ’ he said			1
‘ so , just because the @entity4 finalists are back in , does n’t mean it will automatically happen			0
we have to be prepared			0
’ @entity9 ’s performance in the first test was an indication of the strides they are making but there is an acceptance that it is high time to claim a meaningful prize			1
a series victory over the world champions would fit the bill			0
‘ we need to get over the line somewhere and here is the perfect place to do it , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ by doing it against the @entity23 , it would be a hell of a statement			1
we ’ve only ever won two @entity173 here , so we ’re literally going to make history if we do it			1
‘ i think , as a team , we ’re being talked about			0
we ’re playing good rugby , we ’re picking up good wins			0
’ @entity180 hooker @entity179 flew home from the tour on monday night to have treatment on a knee injury .			0
