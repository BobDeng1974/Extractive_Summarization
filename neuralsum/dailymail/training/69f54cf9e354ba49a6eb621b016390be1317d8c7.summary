@entity8 , 19 , said : ' i was taking pictures of our new house when i saw something run across the field and in front of my lens			1
' it was absolutely massive and was hopping up and down like a large cat - there 's no way it was a fox or a dog			2
' @entity23 of @entity7 or runaway pet dog ? student @entity8 , 19 , took this picture in @entity4 mr @entity8 managed to take several frames before the animal disappeared into undergrowth in the field at @entity30 , just a few miles from remote @entity7 where the phantom wildcat is said to roam			1
he said : ' it ran around 60 metres in just a few seconds and was leaping in the air with its front two legs first			0
