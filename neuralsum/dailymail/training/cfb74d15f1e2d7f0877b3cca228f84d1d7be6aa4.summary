but if you ’re over 40 or a mum — or both , like me — i bet you ’ve never tried one , and are happily letting this trend pass you by			1
in my job as a tv presenter on @entity20 , i ’ve interviewed stars such as @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
sitting next to such icons i have to look my best , so i go for fitted dresses and pencil skirts			2
a midriff - revealing crop - top would be the last thing on my mind when choosing an on - air outfit			1
at 47 , the moment for flashing my tummy has passed			1
i have two children , @entity36 , nine , and @entity37 , four , and these days my stomach is n’t my best feature			2
i ’d never dream of airing it in public			2
but when i saw a friend layering a crop - knit over a slinky top , i realised that shrunken styles do n’t automatically equal bared belly buttons			1
you just need some clever styling tricks			2
it ’s revolutionary : the cropped shape tricks the eye , elongating your bottom half , making you look taller , slimmer and drawing attention away from your stomach as the hem falls at the slimmest point of your waist			1
fashion editor @entity58 showed me how			2
@entity60 crop top , £ 45.99 , zara.com white dress , £ 39.99 , zara.com necklace , £ 45 , stelladot.co.uk nude patent courts , £ 185 , lucychoilondon.com a crop top is a modern substitute for a shawl and brilliant for concealing upper arms			2
i ca n’t believe this top and dress together cost less than £ 100 ! i love the drama of the kimono - style sleeves			1
the thick fabric of the dress is very forgiving , skimming over the tummy rather than accentuating it			2
i ’m also a fan of nude shoes as they lengthen my legs			0
this crop top is perfect for a wedding or the races , but you could also dress it down with skinny jeans			0
who needs a shawl ! this pink crop top , £ 45.99 , @entity88 , cleverly conceals the upper arms , and can be dressed up or down @entity90 with a shirt : perfect for disguising bits you 'd rather hide while maintaining form ( @entity96 shirt , £ 79 , reiss.com ) white shirt , £ 79 , reiss.com @entity97 & black jumper , £ 16.75 , forever21.com skinny jeans , £ 240 , @entity100 at @entity101 blue snakeskin courts , £ 159 , reiss.com shirts are a weekend staple of mine			0
i usually wear them with skinny jeans and boots when i head out for coffee or go shopping			0
but i ’d never thought to pair them with a cropped top before			1
shirts are great at disguising bits you ’d rather hide , but if you ’re not careful , they can make you look shapeless			0
a smooth , cropped jumper worn over the top solves the problem as it enhances your figure			1
a casual yet chic bargain			1
paired with a pencil : the high waist ensures no flesh is on sho ( @entity127 pencil skirt , £ 20 , next.co.uk ) white crop jumper , £ 35 , marksandspencer.com stripe pencil skirt , £ 20 , next.co.uk black courts , £ 360 , jimmychoo.com a simple jersey pencil skirt goes great with a crop top — the high waist means there ’s no flesh on show and the sleek silhouette is slimming			1
the stripes on this trendy skirt make my body look longer and the gentle ribbing on the cotton jumper is flattering on the bust			0
it ’s not too short , and while the neckline is a little high for me , i like the long sleeves — perfect for this time of year			0
even though the top is not tucked in , i feel secure			0
perfect for a lunch or even a dinner party			0
blue jumper , £ 525 , the row at @entity153 @entity155 dress , £ 35 , marksandspencer.com cream courts , £ 360 , jimmychoo.com picka gorgeous jumper , like this cornflower blue number , and wear it over a long - sleeved dress for a chic look			1
i like the idea of wearing a cropped knit over a dress with the sleeves sticking out — it brings the outfit together			1
but i ’m not sure this is the right dress for a mum like me			0
though it ’s comfortable , it ’s also clingy and thin , so it ’s unflattering on the tummy area			0
i ’d have to hold in my stomach permanently to get away with this — or wear a good pair of @entity176			0
luxe layering : allowing the dress sleeves to stick out brings the outfit together ( @entity97 jumper , £ 525 , the row at @entity153 ) with tight trousers : this look is perfect for a casual day out ( red floral crop top , £ 22 , missselfridge.com ) red floral crop top , £ 22 , missselfridge.com black trousers , £ 99 , @entity188 at @entity189 black patent courts , £ 149 , reiss.com i was pleasantly surprised when i looked in the mirror when i tried this on			0
suddenly i ’ve got a bust ! not much to look at on the hanger , this clingy top is deceptively supportive and the square neckline is flattering			0
paired with high - waisted jeans , or classic black trousers it ’s perfect for a casual day out			2
the only problem was that the tight @entity204 fabric rode up , meaning you could sometimes see my bare back , so i ’m not sure i would buy it .			0

at 47 , presenter and mother - of - two @entity0 *avoided* the cropped trend
but discovered this *versatile* and chic look does *n't* need to show skin
