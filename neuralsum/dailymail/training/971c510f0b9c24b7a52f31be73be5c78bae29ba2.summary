shoppers are being urged to boycott supermarket chicken after a report showed alarming numbers are contaminated with a potentially lethal bug			1
seven out of ten fresh chickens are carrying campylobacter on the skin , according to new study from the @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1
the bug is responsible for an estimated 280,000 cases of food poisoning each year and as many as 100 deaths			0
however the food watchdog made it clear that all the supermarkets are putting customers at risk			0
consumer groups have condemned the retailers , saying they should ‘ hang their heads in shame ’ for selling food they know is dangerous			1
but @entity29 , the professor of food policy at @entity31 , went further and advised families to boycott chicken until the industry can guarantee the meat is safe			1
he compared the public health crisis to mad cow disease and salmonella , saying : ‘ i would suggest that we refuse to buy poultry until this is sorted out			2
this is a public health scandal easily on a par to that of the 1980s - 90s			0
’ the number of fresh shop - bought chickens contaminated with the lethal campylobacter food poisoning bug has risen to 70 per cent professor @entity29 went on to suggest that the public should withhold its money until confidence in the safety of chicken is restored			1
‘ this may not be part of the public health methods but it ’s definitely what history shows works when things are dire , ’ he said			2
the @entity9 found that 70 per cent of chickens on sale over the six months between february and the end of july were contaminated – worse than the 65 per cent reported in a similar study in 2009			1
during the may to july period , the figure was eight in ten birds , and could have been as much as nine in ten for some retailers			0
almost one in five – 18 per cent – of the fresh roasting chickens were contaminated with the highest levels of the bug			1
more than one in 20 , or 6 per cent , carried the bug on the outside of packs , meaning that people simply picking them from the shelf to check a price could fall ill. the study also revealed that @entity15 was the worst performer , with a contamination rate of 78 per cent			1
more than one in ten of its packs – 12 per cent – carried the potentially lethal bug on the outside			2
the second highest contamination rate was for a group of smaller retailers including independent butchers and budget chains like @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 with a contamination rate of 76 per cent			2
the co-op came next followed by @entity99 , @entity100 ’s , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			1
producers have struggled to identify how the bug is introduced to flocks			0
while it is found in the countryside , most of the 800million chickens raised for food in the @entity110 each year spend their entire lives inside which ? executive director @entity113 said : ‘ these results are a damning indictment of supermarkets and consumers will be rightly shocked at the failure of trusted household brands to stem the tide of increasingly high levels of campylobacter			1
supermarket bosses should hang their heads in shame			1
’ earlier this year , retailers mounted a fierce lobbying campaign against the @entity9 survey			2
specifically , they wanted to block the naming and shaming of stores because of the risk to sales and profits			0
initially , they were successful after winning over ministers and officials in the @entity137 , @entity138 and even the prime minister ’s office			0
@entity15 had the highest percentage of contaminated fresh chickens at 78 per cent however the @entity9 decided to publicly shame the stores following pressure from consumer groups , academics and the public			1
critics have argued that the @entity9 and the government have failed to ensure supermarkets sell safe food – with the commercial interests of stores , processors and farmers given greater priority than consumers ’ health			1
significantly , the @entity9 has no powers to force supermarkets to take so - called ‘ dirty chickens ’ off their shelves or to impose any sort of sanction or fine to ensure they make improvements			1
it is hoping that the industry abides by a promise to reduce the number of the highly contaminated birds to 10 per cent by the end of 2015			1
the illness associated with the bug has enormous economic costs in terms of lost days at work and @entity178 treatment			0
some estimates put this bill at £ 900million a year			0
an @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ we take campylobacter seriously and it goes without saying that we ’re disappointed with these findings			1
’ the @entity184 , which represents the supermarkets , claimed the industry is doing its best to tackle the bug			2
@entity188 is killed by thorough cooking and can be limited by careful hygiene but it is the most common form of food poisoning in the @entity110 , affecting an estimated 280,000 people a year			0
symptoms usually develop two to five days after eating contaminated food			0
most people recover after a few days but in some cases , campylobacter infection can cause irritable bowel syndrome , reactive arthritis or miscarriage			0
it can be fatal in young children , the elderly and people with a weakened immune system , including cancer patients			0
around 100 of the victims die from vomiting and stomach upsets			0
poultry is the source of the majority of these cases			0
research by the @entity216 showed that the persistence of campylobacter - a group of bacteria that commonly cause food poisoning - is boosted by ' chicken juice '			2
organic matter exuding from chicken carcasses provides the bacteria with the perfect environment to flourish in the food chain			0
the findings , the researchers said , highlight the importance of cleaning surfaces during food preparation			0
but professor @entity233 , from the @entity234 , said : ‘ frankly it is scandalous that two out of three chickens bought into our households are contaminated with such a serious pathogen , i ca n’t think of any other situation where this would be allowed			2
our poultry flocks need to be vaccinated against campylobacter , even if this slightly increases the cost of poultry products			2

results show every major retailer failed to meet targets to reduce bug
@entity15 had the highest number of contaminated chickens at 78 per cent
*co-operative* had *73* **%** while @entity99 , @entity100 *'s* and @entity101 had *69* **%**
@entity9 said rise could be *due* to tests being done in summer
@entity263 said significant improvements had been made
but which ? said supermarket bosses should ' hang their heads in shame '
families are being *warned* that their @entity2*73* ***turkey**s* could also be infected by @entity275 policy director @entity274 said : ‘ what we know about campylobacter is that all poultry are *susceptible* to some degree . but levels in **turkey** and **turkey** meat are generally lower than in chicken . ’
