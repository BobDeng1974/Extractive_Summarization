@entity1 boss @entity0 is expecting a very tough evening against @entity7 on tuesday the @entity25 believes @entity7 are due a goal glut after a slow start , like former club @entity28 @entity0 managed @entity22 defender @entity29 when he coached @entity31 's under 16 side and rates him highly but @entity0 warned : ‘ i know they are n’t in a good way but they have a good manager and good players			1
‘ look at @entity2 , they were very bad two weeks ago then they score eight goals			0
they have scored 13 in two games			0
‘ you can not know what is , and what is not , a good time to play @entity7			1
‘ you have to remember , they are a @entity48 team and we are a @entity50 team			1
there is a big difference between @entity7 and us			2
‘ but we must go there to win , you ca n’t go to enjoy the atmosphere			0
’ @entity31 striker @entity56 has been in excellent form for @entity1 and has five goals from seven starts this season @entity0 is wary of the threat of @entity61 and co despite @entity7 's poor run of form @entity64 is another of @entity0 's players enjoying his football , and will hope to impress on tuesday @entity68 - former assistant to @entity69 at the @entity70 - is set to start with @entity72 loanee @entity71 in attack			1
the 21 - year - old is one of three @entity76 youngsters allowed to head north this season because of the relationship of the two bosses			2
@entity56 – @entity0 looks to have pulled off something of a coup by persuading the silky @entity25 to join the club			2
the 24 - year - old scored 23 times in 46 league games for @entity86 and already he has five from seven starts for @entity1			1
@entity71 – the @entity72 loanee has proved a @entity90 goal machine following spells at @entity92 and @entity93 last season			0
he opened his account for his new club at the weekend and will be out to prove his worth against @entity24 opponents			0
@entity64 – the former @entity100 and @entity101 schemer is in frightening form and has plundered seven from midfield this season , including his @entity106 free - kick at @entity107			2
he is the man who makes @entity1 tick			2
and @entity0 said : ‘ i have n’t spoken to him ( @entity69 ) yet – but maybe i will ring him at half - time ( for some advice )			1
‘ but we know how difficult this will be , no matter what team they play			0
’ one of the players @entity0 could target in @entity7 ’s suspect backline is 20 - year - old @entity29 , who was hauled off after 22 minutes of the 3 - 1 defeat at @entity118 on saturday			1
the @entity120 loanee played under @entity0 with @entity31 under - 16s and he tried to bring him to @entity122 last season			2

last season we were working very well and were consistent but we went seven games without scoring one goal			0
now , touch wood , we have recovered our consistency and have many options to score goals			0
‘ for @entity7 , losing a player like @entity142 will always be a very important miss , because he is one player who scored an unbelievable amount of goals both for @entity7 and his national team			2
he is a big miss. ’ @entity159 , who has been used from the bench so far for @entity7 , will start against @entity1 @entity64 's good form has helped @entity1 with their last three games and climb up to 5th @entity163 was criticised for his performance on saturday but @entity7 will hope to bounce back			1
