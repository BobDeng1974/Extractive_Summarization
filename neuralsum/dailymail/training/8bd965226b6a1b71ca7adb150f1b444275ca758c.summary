by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell as the tremors from @entity4 ’s earth - shattering defeat of @entity5 began to fade on thursday , we were left to wonder whether the tectonic plates of men ’s tennis still had further to shift			1
can this 23 - year - old @entity11 break new ground and beat another one of the @entity12 ? @entity13 will hope the answer is no on friday and the @entity15 certainly has experience on his side			1
@entity18 : @entity11 's @entity4 celebrates beating defending @entity20 champion @entity5 in control : @entity22 started far faster than @entity5 and never looked like letting his early lead slip while this is @entity4 ’s debut in a @entity26 semi-final , @entity13 has been in 23 , winning on 13 occasions			1
he lifted the title here in 2011 , entered the tournament as no 1 seed , and has career earnings topping $ 62million , essentially everything to which @entity4 aspires			2
such gold and silver might not be far away			0
the @entity5 win cemented @entity4 ’s status from promising youth to serious contender , following on from his victory at @entity42 ’s last month			1
he is laying foundations and toppling @entity13 will add another level			1
going the distance : @entity13 needed five sets to beat @entity47 in the quarter - finals on the slide : @entity13 had trouble with his footing against @entity47 and switched his footwear during the match @entity4 ’s respected coach @entity54 said : ‘ he ’s got more than a chance			1
i ’ve got no ceiling on what @entity4 can do			2
‘ what a great challenge it is for him , but also for @entity13			2
he is not going to walk out on court thinking he ’s got this semi-final in the bag			0
we ’re expecting a match of high intensity with a lot of good quality tennis			0
’ @entity4 ’s rise can be traced back to the appointment of @entity54 last october and the coach added : ‘ at the start we spoke about how i was going to navigate him through a @entity26			2
‘ it ’s about how you treat these off - days			0
during our practice sessions there are a few little things we pick up on			0

’ making him work : @entity22 smashes an athletic winner during his fine victory against @entity5 sorted : @entity4 salutes the @entity88 crowd after beating their favourite son in the quarter - final @entity13 leads @entity92 3 - 1 in previous encounters , winning their last one in straight sets at the @entity95 in 2013			1

‘ the fact that he has n’t lost a match in the grasscourt season this year says enough about his quality — also winning against @entity5			1
