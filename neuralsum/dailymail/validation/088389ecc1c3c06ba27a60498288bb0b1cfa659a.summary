forensic tests on the body of @entity5 state prosecutor @entity4 who accused the president of a cover - up with @entity8 indicate that he was murdered , his ex-wife said today			1
he was found shot dead in the bathroom of his locked apartment in january , hours before he was due to testify against president @entity11 in the @entity12			1
he was trying to arrest the president after claiming she helped cover up @entity8 's alleged role in a 1994 bombing which killed 85 at a @entity16 in @entity17			1
the mysterious circumstances surrounding mr @entity4 's death unleashed a storm of conspiracy theories			1
his ex-wife , @entity22 , hired a private team to analyse the autopsy results and run additional tests			2
on the offensive : @entity5 president @entity11 ( left ) has denied claims helped @entity8 cover up a terrorist attack			1
the claims were made by @entity4 ( right ) - who was mysteriously shot dead @entity5 authorities have not released full results of his autopsy , more than six weeks after he was found sprawled in a pool of blood in his flat			2
the few details made public so far have suggested suicide , although the lead investigator into mr @entity4 's death said she could not categorically say if he shot himself in the head or was killed			1
but today , his ex-wife - the mother of their two children - said : ' @entity4 did n't have an accident			2
he did n't commit suicide			0
' earlier today , ms @entity22 , who is a judge , deposited the forensic evidence backing up her allegations at the state prosecutors ' office in @entity17			2
she did not give details of the findings to journalists			0
yesterday , a full - page advert , signed by the @entity54 and bearing an @entity5 flag , questioned mr @entity4 's motives and attacked his argument			1
' one must ask oneself what objectives @entity4 was pursuing with a complaint plagued with contradictions , lacking logic and without legal basis , ' it declared			2
mrs @entity11 : the president 's name was on a draft warrant discovered in the home of @entity4 ' can one think of a hypothesis other than seeking to generate a destabilising political effect ? ' mr @entity4 had accused the president and top administration officials of helping @entity8 officials hide their and @entity8 's alleged role in the country 's worst - ever terrorist attack			1
his 289 - page investigation , which was published a few days after his death , was based on wiretaps of top administration officials that he argued proved the secret deal with @entity8			0
according to mr @entity4 , the president allegedly orchestrated the deal in exchange for economic trade			0
ms @entity11 rejected the allegations , and @entity8 denied any role in the bombing			1
the prosecutor was found shot in the head in his apartment in the capital 's upmarket @entity93 district on january 18 , triggering protests in the streets			2
his mysterious death triggered a @entity99 fightback by the government , whose officials said the prosecutor was trying to smear the nation			0
senior government official @entity104 claimed last month the allegations were part of an attempt to unseat the president and bring neoliberals back to power			0
' we are facing an attempted coup d'etat , that aims to get rid of the president , ' he wrote			0
but the alleged smears have upset other politicians			0
@entity116 told the @entity117 : ' it 's awful to see so many accusations against a person who ca n't defend himself			0
' instead of clarifying anything , @entity121 is damaging the investigation into @entity4 's death			1
' anger : protesters clashed with police after the death of the prosecutor in his locked apartment in january horror : the 1994 bombing of a @entity133 centre , run by the @entity134 , left 85 dead and remains the country 's most deadly terrorist attack			1
@entity8 has denied it was involved yesterday 's newspaper advert highlighted a judge 's ruling which said mr @entity4 's argument had a lack of ' coherence and integration '			1
judge @entity144 , who made the ruling , said : ' there is not a single element of evidence , even circumstantial , that points to the head of state			0
' that ruling was appealed yesterday by prosecutor @entity150 , who has taken up the case following mr @entity4 's death			1
he said the judges ' decision was ' premature ' and an investigation was needed to ' prove or disprove the facts '			0
the appeal sends the case to the @entity159 of judges , which can uphold or reject last week 's decision by federal judge @entity162			0
@entity5 will go to the polls in october , but the president is barred from running for a third term by the country 's constitution and will have to step down			0
she has nevertheless gone on the offensive , accusing opposition parties of using the row for political gain and claiming the @entity174 and @entity175 were meddling in @entity5 's affairs .			0

@entity4 's body found in january a day before @entity12 hearing
claims over 1994 @entity133 centre attack which killed 85 in @entity17
