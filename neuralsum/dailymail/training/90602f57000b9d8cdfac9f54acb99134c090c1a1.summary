a teenage gymnast who suffered a career - ending spine injury at the age of ten has revealed how she managed to make an unlikely return as one of the sport 's top - ranked athletes			1
@entity7 , 14 , from @entity8 , who is starring in @entity10 's new win from within campaign , was working towards earning a place on the @entity15 women 's national gymnastics team when a simple mistake during a floor routine left her with a fractured neck			1
but while that injury alone should not have kept her from competing , the pre-teen suffered another devastating blow when doctors diagnosed her with dyslastic spondylolisthesis , a congenital spine disorder which prevented her vertebrae from fusing together			1
the procedure left her bedridden for a number of months , with experts predicting that she would then have to spent another year in recovery			1
' @entity7 had a mishap on floor one day , took off wrong and landed on top of her head , ' @entity46 coach @entity45 explains in the @entity10 video			1
' it turned out to be an injury that just needed time to heal , it was n't in any way a career - ending or serious injury			1
but as her neck was healing , she noticed that her back was hurting			2
' most kids who take a year or more off do not make a comeback in a sport like this			2
gymnastics was over for her			0
' ' my dream was to compete at @entity67 's and to be on the national team for gymnastics , ' @entity7 said			1
' when they told me i would have to take a year off , i was devastated			2
' down but not out : @entity7 initially thought that her injury would take just a matter of months to heal ' frustrated ' : doctors later diagnosed @entity7 with a severe spinal disorder which required painful and complex surgery during the first few months of her recovery , @entity7 was incredibly frustrated and angry at how helpless she felt			1
' i like trying to feel like i 'm independent , but people had to do everything for me ; i could n't even walk on my own , ' she recalled			0
her father @entity80 admits that watching his daughter struggle with just the simplest of tasks was heart - breaking for @entity7 's family - but to witness her passion slowly start to return as her recovery quickened gave them all the determination and motivation they needed to help her return to her beloved sport			1
' i just remember when she was walking across the room three feet , she was so frustrated , she could n't stand up , ' he said			0
' but by the time she was walking to the end of the hallway , that was almost when the light switch turned on and she could see she was making progress			0
' determination : @entity7 has had to dedicate endless hours towards ensuring that she was able to regain her skills flying high : the teen defied doctors ' expectations when she returned to the gym after just 13 months of recovery after 13 months of recovery , @entity7 was finally given the all - clear by doctors and told that she could start to try other forms of physical activity , beyond walking			1
but while many believed that the hardest part of her recovery was over , @entity7 had to face yet another seemingly impossible battle - returning to gymnastics and attempting to regain all of the skills that she had lost during her time away from the sport			1
' when i would reach down to touch my toes , i would get to about my knees , ' @entity7 said			2
' my arms especially - i lost all of my upper body strength			0
' it was really hard			0
' but her determination and unwavering self - belief paid off , and within a year , the teenager was competing - and winning - at national competitions once again			2
comeback kid : @entity7 's goal is to get a full college scholarship so that she can continue competing at the highest level ' i 'm fearless ' : the young gymnast has managed to overcome every obstacle put in her way ' [ @entity7 ] does n't get down , she just keeps working and working and working , ' coach @entity45 said			1
' i thought that it was very possible that she could compete the next year			0
and she was ready to go by the first meet			0
and she competed not one event , but all four events			0
' it 's the best comeback story i 've seen in 25 years			0
and the way she 's going , she 's going to reach her ultimate goal , which is to get a full ride scholarship			0
' ' these things just happen and when they do , you have to be ready , you have to put all of your effort into it , ' @entity7 added			2
' what makes me different is that , i 'm fearless			0
