by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 30 june 2013 updated : 02:20 est , 1 july 2013 too expensive : value pricing of drugs , which starts in march 2014 , may deny thousands of cancer patients of @entity5 drugs thousands of cancer patients will lose out when the government ’s special drugs fund for @entity10 is wound up next year , claim campaigners			1
they are appealing to @entity12 to intervene amid fears that access to cancer medicines will revert to being the worst in @entity15 , with more than 16,000 patients a year denied help			1
cancer charities are calling for the government to confirm that the @entity20 will continue beyond march 2014 to prevent a return to the ‘ dark days ’ when patients were deprived of life - prolonging drugs on the @entity5			1
the £ 200million - a - year fund , which began in april 2011 , has led so far to 30,000 patients in @entity10 being given drugs banned on the @entity5 by @entity28 , the rationing body			1
they are five times more likely to get a new cancer drug than patients in @entity34 , and three times more likely than @entity37 patients			2
the government ’s aim , which was a @entity40 election pledge , was to enable @entity5 doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit			0
but it was a stopgap for three years , until a new method of assessment for drug pricing is brought in			2
@entity48 , chief executive of the @entity49 which is behind the appeal , said the fund had been highly successful , with ‘ dire predictions ’ that it could bankrupt the @entity5 proven to be false			2
in a letter to the prime minister , he says cancer patients face uncertainty because a new way of pricing drugs – value - based pricing – due to come in next year will exclude all the drugs currently provided for patients under the @entity20			1
patients will also be unable to get drugs that are close to being licensed , which is called off - label prescribing			1
almost two - thirds of cancer treatments considered by @entity28 ( the @entity28 ) are rejected			0
it is estimated that ending the fund will prevent more than 16,000 patients annually from getting potentially life - extending drugs			1
mr @entity48 said : ‘ value - based pricing is due to be introduced at the end of the year but there is no detail on how it will help cancer patients			1
helping hand : the @entity20 fund has led so far to 30,000 patients in @entity10 being given drugs which would have been banned on the @entity5 ‘ what we do know is that it will do nothing to help those patients who need drugs currently available through the fund and that , with @entity28 in charge , we have little confidence that it will be effective for new drugs			1
without action now there is a danger that we will go back to the dark days of the postcode lottery			0
‘ at the last election @entity12 made a promise to cancer patients			1
that was not just a promise for three years and we urge him to take action to ensure patients can continue to gain access to life - extending drugs			2
’ in 2011 @entity103 , 66 , a mother of two with five grandchildren , was diagnosed with thyroid cancer too late to have surgery			0
mrs @entity103 , who lives in @entity107 , @entity108 , with her husband @entity109 , 69 , ran out of options after radiotherapy failed to work			0
her cancer specialist succeeded in getting her a new drug licensed for liver and kidney cancers – but not thyroid cancer – through the fund			0
after nine months on the drug mrs @entity118 feels well and has been able to go abroad on holiday for the first time in three years			0
she said : ‘ i ’m not expecting a cure but everybody should get a chance to try a drug for three months to see if it works			0
‘ we ’ve had time together as a family because my life has been extended , but this will no longer be possible for people in my position if the fund does not continue			0
‘ the drug i ’m taking has been licensed now but it was n’t when i first used it , and that will be stopped in the future			0
’ @entity40 mp @entity136 , chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on cancer , said : ‘ in the absence of detail as to the fund ’s replacement early next year , the government should consider an extension until the new system is established			2

value pricing will exclude all drugs currently provided by fund
loss of @entity20 will effect 16,000 patients in need
campaigners plead with @entity12 so save £ 200m - a - year fund
