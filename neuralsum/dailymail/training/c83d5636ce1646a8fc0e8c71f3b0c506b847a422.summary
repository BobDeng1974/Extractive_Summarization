ever get the feeling someone ’s trying to make a monkey out of you ? by the dejected look on @entity6 the chimpanzee ’s face he thinks @entity7 are doing just that – after they stopped selling discount bananas to his sanctuary			1
fortunately for the 33 - year - old chimp , @entity11 , who runs the @entity12 in @entity13 , near @entity14 , took a more proactive approach to the problem			2
however , it has now changed its mind mrs @entity11 used to drive to @entity7 to buy cut - price waste fruit , vegetables and other produce , until last september staff abruptly told her the special deal was over			1
she wrote to the store manager asking for an explanation			0
but when none came she posted the letter on @entity35			0
it said : ‘ it was very disappointing to be told that @entity7 will no longer support the sanctuary			1
i have telephoned and left a message for you but having heard nothing i am writing instead			0
’ as she waited weeks for an answer , thousands read her post – and many threatened to boycott @entity7			0
@entity7 said it had changed its policy on supplying waste food and did n't want the monkeys to become ill she was eventually told the supermarket had changed its rules because it did n’t want the monkeys to become ill from eating out - of - date food			1
she said : ‘ there is no way we would feed the monkeys anything we thought might put their health at risk			0
’ @entity7 has insisted that it can no longer provide eggs , yoghurts and other fresh foods			2
but it has relented on discounted fruit and veg – and a steady supply is back on the menu again			0
the fruit , veg and other fresh waste food is given to the 90 monkeys and apes who live at the sanctuary the ape sanctuary spends about £ 5,000 a year on waste food from the supermarket for the monkeys the ape sanctuary has bought waste food from @entity7 at 10 per cent of the retail price for several years however , the supermarket giant said it would continue to supply fruit and veg , but not eggs and yoghurts .			1

ape and @entity89 *regularly* bought cheap waste food from @entity7
used waste fruit and veg to feed 90 monkeys at sanctuary near @entity14
but @entity7 stopped *delivery* over *concerns* monkeys could get ill from food
supermarket giant has now confirmed it will continue to provide to centre
