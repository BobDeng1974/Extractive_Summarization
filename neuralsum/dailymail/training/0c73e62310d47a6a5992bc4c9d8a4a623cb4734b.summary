by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 12:08 est , 18 november 2012 they say that a cat always lands on its feet			0
but these kitties are surely risking one of their nine lives in a hilarious skydving stunt to promote an insurance firm			1
while it may look like these fearless furry felines are freefalling thousands of feet , animal lovers can rest assured that no animals were harmed in the making of the advert			1
despite its convincing appearance , it has emerged that the commercial was produced using green screen technology			1
the company had asked its customers for advertising ideas , but probably did n't bargain on @entity53 's wacky concept			1
the video shows the cats appearing to freefall with squinted eyes and the wind rushing through their fur			0
the group then join up in formation linking paws in an adorable attempt to spell out the word @entity63 across the sky			0
set to @entity66 's 1996 hit @entity67 , the ad then shows the moggies parachutes opening as they begin the slow descent back down to earth			0
produced by advertising agency @entity72 , the 40 second video has gone viral with almost 500,000 hits on @entity74			0
formation : the cats begin to move closer as they attempt to spell out a word across the sky linking up : as the kitties get closer on their freefall they look to hold on to one another cute : the moggies hold paws as they move into formation while most viewers appear to see the funny side of the clip , some seem to be fooled into thinking that the cats involved were actually thrown from a plane			2
the company has said that it followed animal welfare laws to ensure that the animals were unhurt in during the filming			2
it is one of @entity27 's oldest insurance firms and the advert is , of course , designed to promote its pet insurance policies			1
impressive : the cats spell out the word @entity53 in honour of the customer who came up with the idea for the advert fearless : the cats break formation and begin to freefall to earth again against a back drop of a bright sun floating to earth : the advert ends with the cats opening their parachutes and beginning a safe descent to the ground			0

advert for @entity27 insurance firm was designed by one of its customers
no animals were harmed in its making *-* green screen technology is behind the hilarious clip
