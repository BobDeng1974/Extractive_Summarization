@entity0 , 64 , has 26 medical conditions she is not sure if operator was being ' rude or just stupid ' patient 's group brands treatment at hands of @entity7 ' absolutely inhuman ' by @entity8 published : 12:40 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 09:30 est , 30 november 2012 a blind pensioner was told by an ambulance service operator she could get to hospital on her own as her guide dog would read the signs			1
outraged @entity0 , 64 , has had three strokes , kidney failure , heart failure and depends on her 10 - year - old guide dog @entity19 for getting around			1
she has to make regular visits to the hospital for treatment and until recently she was regularly picked up by the @entity7 and taken to her appointments			1
@entity24 , 64 , was effectively told that her guide dog @entity19 , pictured with her , could read signs and get her to hospital but after calling the service last week , ms @entity0 was informed by an operator that she no longer met criteria and would have to make her own way to the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35			1
ms @entity0 , who lives alone in @entity36 and has no family , was then left speechless when the operator effectively told her that her @entity39 could read the hospital signs for her when she got there			1
she said yesterday : ' when the lady on the phone made it clear the ambulance would n’t be taking me for my appointment , i asked her what i would do if i made my own way to the hospital			0
' it ’s a big place and they use signs to direct patients , but obviously i ca n’t read them			0
ms @entity0 was trying to get to her appointment at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , pictured , when the operator refused to provide her with an ambulance ' she said to me " there are signs "			1
so i reminded her that i am visually impaired , to which she replied " but you ’ve got a guide dog "			0
' so i had to tell her that my dog ca n’t read			0
she ’s a lovely , clever little thing but she ’s not that clever			0
i ’m not sure if the operator was being rude or just stupid			2
' as well as being blind , ms @entity0 has 26 different medications for conditions such as bronchitis , diabetes and asthma			1
she has used the patient transport system for years to get to appointments but a new booking system was introduced in october and she was told she no longer met criteria for a lift			2
@entity77 , from the @entity78 said @entity0 ’s treatment was ' absolutely inhuman '			1
ms @entity0 , pictured at her home with her guide dog @entity19 , was left outraged by the @entity7 's refusal to provide her with transport to her hospital appointment she said : ' i doubt any of the people in the ambulance service would think that was clever if it was one of their relatives			1
' what a ridiculous thing to say			0
that operator should be retrained on respect , compassion and dignity for patients , because she obviously has n’t got any			2
' with regards to ms @entity0 not being taken to hospital , that is also not acceptable			2
not only is it inconvenient for the patient it costs a lot of money			0
' they should be making sure this lady gets to and from hospital safely and has no difficulties in getting around hospitals			0
' the matter has now been resolved and @entity0 will be picked up by the ambulance again , but she said she is nervous about calling the operator to book up			2
a spokesman for the @entity7 said that they would not comment on specifics of the case because of patient confidentiality , but issued this statement : ' ambulance transport is provided for patients who have a mobility or medical need			1
' the decision to provide transport was based upon the initial information provided by the patient			0
once further information and the patient ’s circumstances were clarified , transport was confirmed and will continue to be provided in future			0
