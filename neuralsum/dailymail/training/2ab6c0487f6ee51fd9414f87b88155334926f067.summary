the coordinated attacks by the navy and ground troops were the latest wave of a brutal offensive against anti-government protests launched at the beginning of the month and came as thousands marched on the city over the weekend to demand the president 's ousting			1
the assault showed @entity16 has no intention of scaling back the campaign even though it has brought international outrage and new @entity33 and @entity34 sanctions			2

' the shooting is intense			2
we can not go out			2

@entity39 soldiers carrying the coffin of their colleague @entity108 in @entity13 the assault on @entity13 began saturday , when tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled into @entity112 amid intense gunfire			1

on friday , as many as 10,000 marched there , calling for the president 's departure			2
after their initial assault on the city saturday , @entity39 forces pushed back into @entity13 again sunday			1

many people were wounded from indiscriminate fire on houses , they said			0
' they are trying to take control of the city as they did in other places , ' said @entity180 , head of the @entity181 in @entity9 , said the state was setting a ' precedent ' by using gunboats to shell its own people			2
using gunboats to fight protesters , who are mostly unarmed and peaceful , marks a new escalation in the regime 's crackdown			0
but the determined opposition is so far unbowed even though at least 1,700 people have been killed since march , according to activists and human rights groups			0
former @entity196 president @entity195 returned to court today to face charges of killing protesters , in a hearing that could decide if the head of the ruling military council will take the stand as a witness			0

@entity195 , accused of corruption and ordering the killing of protesters , went on trial on august 3 in a case that has gripped the @entity222 world , where leaders rule for life and are seldom held to account			0
the 83 - year - old , who is said to have stomach cancer , was pictured today in a cage , and wheeled into court on a hospital trolley			1
the tough new offensive began with the @entity232 holy month of @entity233 at the start of august and killed several hundred people in the first week alone			0
the brutality fueled international outrage with @entity9 , a hardline @entity238 state closely allied with @entity239 , and led to new sanctions against the regime by the @entity33 , @entity242 and @entity243			0
the @entity244 stepped up calls for a global trade embargo on oil and gas from @entity9 , warning even some of @entity251 's closest allies that they must ' get on the right side of history ' and cut links with a government that uses violence to repress protesters			0
secretary of state @entity258 said international opinion was hardening against @entity16 , noting a ' crescendo of condemnation ' from world powers and @entity9 's @entity238 neighbors			0
but she said tougher action was required , too			0
in @entity13 on sunday , the sharp crackle of machine - gun fire and loud explosions sounded across parts of the city , once known for its beach resorts that attracted tourists throughout the summer season			1
@entity274 smoke drifted across the sea front			0
the city has a potentially explosive sectarian mix. @entity278 , which are a majority in @entity9 , live in @entity13 's urban core , while @entity16 's minority @entity282 sect , an offshoot of @entity285 , populates villages on the city 's outskirts , along with small minorities of @entity290 , ethnic @entity291 and other groups			2
the crackdown , which has targeted predominantly @entity295 areas of the city of more than 600,000 , raised concerns of sectarian bloodshed in a country that has already seen an alarming rise in sectarian tensions since the start of the uprising			1

the @entity311 could not verify the activists ' accounts or the contents of the videos			0
@entity9 has banned most foreign media and restricted local coverage , making it impossible to get independent confirmation of the events on the ground			0

thousands of others have been arrested , many of them tortured , according to rights groups			0
the @entity145 said in a statement sunday that it has documented the names of 71 @entity98 who have died under torture in @entity9 since the start of the uprising in mid-march			0
