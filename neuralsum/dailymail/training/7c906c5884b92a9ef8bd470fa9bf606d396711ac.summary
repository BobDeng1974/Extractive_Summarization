by @entity0 published : 09:51 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 23:48 est , 29 november 2013 @entity3 is drawing criticism from animal rights activists who claim the school is euthanizing dogs in ' unnecessary ' dental experiments			1
the @entity10 posted a video last week , taken as part of a three - month undercover investigation , which shows dogs having their teeth pulled , replaced with implants and then euthanized to test bone samples			1
two days after the video was released , activists organized a protest on the campus calling for the end of animal testing , waving signs that said ' humanity : not just for humans ' and ' dogs should not die for dentures ' , according to the @entity29			2
another demonstration is scheduled for december 7			0
the undercover video , narrated by actress @entity32 , focuses on a dog named ' @entity34 ' used as a test subject			1
@entity34 and others , @entity37 says , were bought from ' unscrupulous dealers ' and put through ' unnecessary suffering '			0
another dog is shown at the end of the research process , having been euthanized so that researchers could pull a little piece of jaw bone to sample			1
@entity10 spokesman @entity65 says that researchers use the bone sample to compare @entity3 's own dentures to that of a competitor			1
while using dogs for this kind of research is legal , the activists believe it is still a moral breach			0
the video also points out that @entity3 gets its dogs from a dealer that is under investigation by the @entity80			1
aim : the @entity10 hopes to stop federal research funding to the university ( above ) after releasing the video the @entity80 did in fact file a complaint against the university 's dealer - @entity86 - in september saying he improperly obtained dogs , impeded an inspection of his operation in @entity92 , @entity93 and provided substandard care for dogs there			1
mr @entity86 is a random - source class - b dealer which means he can get dogs from auctions , ' free to a good home ' ads , animal control , and even shelters to resell to research facilities			0
from 2005 to 2012 , @entity3 obtained 186 dogs from mr @entity86			2
the six used in dental experiments were obtained in november 2012 , operated on in march and euthanized in may			1
however , there are no allegations that the dogs obtained by the university were improperly obtained			0
and @entity112 points out that @entity3 is far from the worst offender when it comes to using dogs in experimental research			2
taking a stand : @entity3 pre-veterinary student @entity118 now plans on transferring schools after seeing the video @entity121 used 50 dogs in its programs in 2012 , twice as much as the 22 @entity3 reported			2
and that 's nothing compared to the 1,158 @entity125 used in 2011 , including 101 defined as ' @entity126 ' - to be used in ' experiments ... involving accompanying pain or distress to the animals for which appropriate anesthetic , analgesic , or tranquilizing drugs were used			0
' @entity3 has since responded to the video , saying that dogs are used ' infrequently ' in university research , and that all received anethesia during surgery and pain medication afterwards			2
' the research being done with dogs is neither frivolous nor unnecessary , as alleged by the investigation , and is performed in order to develop safe , effective dental procedures for people , ' said dr @entity147 , @entity3 's senior vice president of research in a statement			1
the investigation has so upset one @entity3 undergrad , she plans on switching schools			0
pre-veterinary science student @entity118 said it took her about two hours to be able to watch the video start to finish without looking away			0
seeing the whole video straight convinced her and another student to transfer schools			0
' what kind of veterinarian would i be if i stuck at a school that was potentially abusing animals ? that goes against everything i 'm for , ' ms @entity118 told the @entity163 .			0

the @entity10 released a video last week showing dogs being used as test subjects in dental experiments at @entity3
undercover video shows the dogs having their teeth pulled , replaced with implants and then euthanized to harvest jaw bone samples
while legal , the @entity10 says that the experiments are unnecessary
