by @entity0 , @entity1 deputy political editor commons speaker @entity2 is under mounting pressure to delay the appointment of a controversial @entity5 as @entity7 ’s most senior official , amid a growing outcry from mps			1
former foreign secretaries @entity10 and @entity12 have added their voices to a cross-party campaign to let mps grill mr @entity2 ’s top choice to become the next @entity18 clerk			1
it came after @entity20 finally broke her silence over the controversy surrounding her proposed appointment			1
it came after an email was leaked from the @entity5 clerk of the @entity36 , @entity35 , to the @entity18 authorities which warned against her appointment			1
responding to the memo ms @entity20 said : ‘ it would not be appropriate for me to comment further in a personal capacity at this time , ’ she said			1
‘ as a senior parliamentary officer , i take seriously my responsibilities to promote and uphold the values and code of conduct articulated in the @entity46			0
’ ms @entity35 apparently cited an incident in which @entity49 cameras were used in the @entity5 @entity7 to track someone pushing an envelope under the door of a senator 's office late at night			1
the episode is being investigated , as cameras are supposed to be used only for security and to prosecute illegal activity			0
but ms @entity58 said her @entity67 ‘ looks forward to the opportunity to explain to the committee the basis of its view that use of the @entity49 footage was in fact authorised , and wholly consistent with parliamentary privilege ’			2
former commons speaker @entity68 has slammed the proposed appointment of ms @entity58 @entity68 , a former @entity18 speaker , said ms @entity58 ' statement ‘ underlines the urgent need for the prime minister to reconsider her proposed appointment as @entity74 ’			1
she added : ‘ mr @entity76 should postpone a decision until widespread concerns about her suitability to fill an important constitutional position at @entity82 are properly addressed			0
’ a growing number of mps have called for ms @entity58 to face a confirmation hearing in front of mps before she can take up the role			2
ms @entity20 is believed to have been recommended for the prestigious role following a recruitment process with a selection panel led by mr @entity2			1
but concerns have been raised about her ability to fulfil the crucial role in which she will advise the speaker and @entity96 over constitutional matters			2
@entity68 has claimed she would be ‘ totally out of her depth ’ in the role			0
@entity101 chairman @entity100 has written to @entity76 asking him to publicly back letting mps scrutinise ms @entity20			1
former commons leader and foreign secretary @entity10 backed the move			1
he told @entity105 : ‘ given the controversy , and without making any observations about the relative merits of the candidate , i think that such pre-appointment scrutiny would be a good way of resolving this			0
’ mrs @entity12 , who also served as leader of the @entity18 , told the newspaper : ‘ these days you can not make an appointment like this without select committee scrutiny			1
’ the £ 200,000 - a - year position combines the role of @entity74 and chief executive responsible for running the building and managing almost 2,000 staff			0
critics have said that while ms @entity58 ' may be a suitable candidate for the chief executive element of the job , they are concerned about her ability to advise @entity102 , the speaker and prime minister on constitutional matters			1
mr @entity2 - who has attempted to drive a significant modernisation of the @entity18 - has come under fire for overlooking the respected deputy clerk @entity134			2
but his allies have defended the way it was handled , with an open recruitment process and lengthy interviews for the shortlisted candidates			0
mr @entity2 chaired the appointment panel which also included @entity141 - who subsequently lost his job as @entity113 in the reshuffle - shadow leader @entity144 , @entity146 chairwoman of the @entity148 @entity147 and liberal democrat @entity149			0
mr @entity2 's spokeswoman said : ‘ this is the first time ever there has been an open and fair recruitment process for the @entity74			0
’ former foreign secretaries @entity12 and @entity10 have called for ms @entity58 to appear in front of a parliamentary committee to scrutinise her appointment eight candidates were interviewed , with a shortlist of three called back for a second round of grilling by the panel			1
the successful candidate 's name is understood to have been put forward to @entity165 to subsequently recommend to the @entity166			0
the vacancy has arisen because of the retirement of commons veteran sir @entity169 amid claims he has clashed with the speaker			2
@entity173 mp @entity172 , who claimed in the @entity18 last month that mr @entity2 had once told sir @entity169 to ‘ f * * * off ’ in front of witnesses - an allegation immediately denied by mr @entity2 - said the speaker should consider resigning			2
on @entity180 he said : ‘ if i were @entity2 , i 'd be thinking about my own position , let alone considering what to do about the rigged appointment of the new clerk			0
’ sir @entity169 has put in place a plan for when he retires at the end of the month , with mr @entity134 acting up as clerk until the new appointment is in place			0
he said the plans ‘ are resilient ’ and that ‘ we could go to the election without a problem			0
i 'm quite sure we would be fine ’ .			0
