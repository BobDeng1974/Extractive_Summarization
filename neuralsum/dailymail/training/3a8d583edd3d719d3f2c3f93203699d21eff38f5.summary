by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:59 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 13:20 est , 24 january 2013 the campaign for @entity3 to break away from the rest of the @entity5 has suffered a devastating blow with a fewer than one in four people backing independence			1
support for @entity11 ’s dream of going it alone is now at its lowest level since the @entity14 was created in 1999			2
experts claim increased publicity for the @entity18 ’s campaign to leave the @entity5 has meant more people are now fearful of what independence might mean			0
better off in : the @entity23 survey revealed only 23 per cent of people want @entity3 to be independent , the lowest level since the @entity14 was established in 1999 just 23 per cent of people want @entity3 to leave the @entity5 , the annual @entity23 survey for 2012 revealed			1
it shows a dramatic drop from 2011 when 32 per cent supported independence			2
almost 60 per cent of those surveyed now say they are ‘ quite ’ or ‘ very ’ worried about independence , up from 46 per cent in 2011			0
mr @entity11 has secured a deal with @entity33 to stage a referendum on independence in autumn 2014			1
@entity35 , director of @entity36 , an independent not - for - profit group which produced the survey , said : ‘ the ' yes ' campaign still needs to convince a much wider section of the public that independence will bring real benefits , especially for @entity3 's economy			2
’ the survey will be a major blow to @entity3 first minister @entity11 , who last year struck a deal with @entity33 to hold a referendum on independence in autumn 2014 @entity3 will be denied a vote on membership of the @entity51 if they choose independence , it emerged last night			1
@entity11 will refuse voters a say on whether they want to leave the @entity51 if he wins the referendum on @entity3 independence			1
the first minister has ruled out an in - out referendum or a vote on the terms of any deal that @entity3 strikes before joining the @entity51 as a separate country			1
prime minister @entity33 has offered an in - out referendum by 2017 after renegotiating a new deal with @entity62 , but @entity3 will only be able to take part if there is a no vote in the independence poll			1
mr @entity11 will ask @entity3 to vote for independence – which he says would include joining the @entity51 – without knowing the terms of membership			1
that means @entity3 could be saddled with a raw deal over the @entity51 budget and border controls or be forced to commit to the euro			1
however , the survey also revealed many @entity3 are confused about the powers that the @entity14 parliament has , and want it to be responsible for most of @entity3 's domestic affairs			0
more than half want @entity14 to set taxes while almost two - thirds said it should set welfare benefits			0
just 6 per cent would want to return all decision - making powers to @entity85			0
if independence is achieved , 42 per cent think @entity3 would have a stronger voice in the world - down from 51 per cent in 2011			1
those who think it would make no difference changed from 27 per cent to 32 per cent			0
on the economy , about a third think it will be better while the same number disagree			0
about one in five would be confident about @entity3 's future , compared with 31 per cent in 2011			2
elections expert professor @entity97 from the @entity98 who worked on the survey , said : ‘ during the course of the last 12 months the independence debate moved firmly to the top of the @entity3 political agenda			0
‘ yet the proponents of independence have apparently struggled to capitalise on the resulting opportunity to persuade @entity3 of the merits of their case			0
‘ instead , more voters appear to have become concerned about the prospect of leaving the @entity5			0
’ @entity3 @entity112 leader @entity111 said mr @entity11 was ' failing spectacularly ' to persuade people of the merits of separation @entity3 @entity112 leader @entity111 said : ‘ this survey shows @entity11 is failing spectacularly to sell his dream of separation to the people of @entity3 , who are growing increasingly sceptical about the concept			1
’ a @entity123 spokeswoman said : ‘ we have already set out our vision for the country we would like @entity3 to be - a country that earns its wealth and shares it more fairly ; a country where every child has the chance to grow up and fulfil their potential			0
‘ during this year the @entity123 will outline the compelling case for independence , leading to a white paper in the autumn that will set out the government 's proposals for how that independent @entity3 will look			2
’ the researchers interviewed a sample of 1,229 adults face - to - face between july and november 2012 .			0
