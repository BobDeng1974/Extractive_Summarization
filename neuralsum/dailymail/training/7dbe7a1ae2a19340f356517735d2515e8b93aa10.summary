by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 11:14 est , 21 december 2012 @entity2 's very own @entity1 is doing his best to bring @entity4 cheer to hundreds of children affected by @entity6			1
dressed up in a bushy white beard and red suit and carrying a sack full of toys , @entity7 could easily be mistaken for the real @entity4 as he delivers gifts in storm - ravaged neighbourhoods			1
every afternoon and night he stuffs his red sack to the brim with presents and heads out to personally deliver them to children who faced a @entity4 without presents after they were washed away during the hurricane			1
he hopes to deliver gifts to around 1,000 children during the next few days			1
' between the requests coming in for personal visits as well as the influx of donations , it 's been a full time job , ' said mr @entity7 , a 31 - year - old political consultant			1
' and kudos to @entity1 , because i do n't know how he pulls it off every year			0
' respect : mr @entity7 , a business consultant , has credited the real @entity1 for his hard work at @entity4 after gaining his own first - hand experience of delivering presents boxes of toys are piled on tables and all over the floor of mr @entity7 's apartment where he spends most of the day updating his list of toy requests and donations , which are pouring in			1
he initially began jotting down the requests on post-it notes , but as demand steadily grew he created a spreadsheet and taped it to the wall			2
' the goal was to match up each child with a toy that they liked or asked @entity1 for , for @entity4 , ' he explained			2
' we basically tried to pair them up with toys i had in stock			0
' the charitable enterprise grew out of a @entity6 donation outreach effort that mr @entity7 had been spearheading for weeks in the wake of the storm , drumming up donations of clothing and food through @entity89			1
as the holidays approached , he realised that lots of children would be without their toys this year - and with their parents preoccupied with the drudgery of storm repairs , many children probably would not even get to sit on @entity1 's lap. so he decided to fill that gap himself			1
' when i was a kid , my toys were very important to me , ' mr @entity7 said			2
' that 's their security blanket , so to speak			0
i could n't sit home and do nothing			0
' donations are coming in by the truckload from all over the country and mr @entity7 has received help from fellow @entity36 like @entity110 , a father of three from @entity35 who has raised more than $ 2,000 from his community and has been filling toy requests at local stores			1
' i started it with $ 500 of my own , ' mr @entity110 said , ' and then people just started contributing			0
' @entity116 : @entity6 hit soon after little @entity118 's first birthday and destroyed her toys			0
here she receives a gift from mr @entity7 ( with her mother @entity121 ) happy : another youngster receives a present			2
mr @entity7 's @entity2 apartment is now stuffed with donated gifts donations : more gifts are delivered to mr @entity7 for children affected by the hurricane after his secret @entity131 caught the public 's imagination on a recent rainy afternoon , mr @entity7 pulled on his white wig and beard and drove out to weather - beaten @entity33 , a town on the @entity136			1
the first stop : the darkened oceanfront home of @entity121 , who was waiting upstairs with her daughter , @entity118			0
@entity118 gazed up as mr @entity7 handed her a toy duck			2
@entity6 struck just after her first birthday party , destroying all of her toys when the basement flooded			0
' as you can see from the outside of the house and the inside of the house , it 's been a disaster , ' said @entity121 , who has been living in a @entity152 - funded hotel room for several weeks with her family			0
' @entity154 ' : donated toys and other @entity4 presents are piled around his @entity2 home charity : mr @entity7 uses a list he created to match children with the toys he has collected for them ready for work : he prepares his @entity1 costume for the next @entity4 deliveries ' we have n't had time to take her to go see @entity1 or to do anything that we would want to do for her first @entity4 that actually matters			1
' ms @entity121 said she was amazed when she learned about mr @entity7 's project			2
' he contacted me and he told me how he 's been going around giving out gifts , ' she said			0
; i was so happy that someone would do this in his free time			0
' watch video here :			0
