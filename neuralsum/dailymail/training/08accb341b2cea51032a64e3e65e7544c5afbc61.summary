by @entity0 for the @entity1 up to 3.8million credit card frauds have been left out of the survey , along with murders , rapes and crimes against children millions of card fraud cases are left out of official figures , making a ‘ mockery ’ of @entity12 figures that crime is falling , it was claimed yesterday			1
damning research shows up to 3.8million bank and credit card frauds are left out of the @entity17 , distorting the true scale of offending			1
if they were included , the number of annual offences would rise by 50 per cent , from the record low of 7.3million to 11million a year			0
it means seven people are defrauded every minute			2
for the annual survey , the @entity26 conducts face - to - face interviews with 40,000 people to glean their experiences of crime			1
but as well as many frauds , it excludes murder and manslaughter because the victim is dead , figures about rape and other sex offences which are calculated differently due to their sensitive nature , and crimes such as drug possession that are considered victimless			2
the @entity26 was criticised last night after it revealed the 3.8million frauds were not in its survey			1
card frauds alone were said to be worth £ 450million last year			1
it was accused of failing to follow new trends as criminals turn to online fraud and other cyber crimes – such as credit card fraud , bogus online auctions and online dating scams – that often carry softer punishments			1
but @entity26 statisticians said it was difficult to be confident about the scale of plastic card fraud because victims often do not report it , or it is counted twice or more by different bodies such as banks and insurers			1
the estimate of the scale of card and banking fraud , which would make it the second biggest area of crime after theft , was slipped out last month			2
professor @entity74 , a criminologist at the @entity75 , said : ‘ ministers were readily persuaded that the @entity17 represented a gold standard for measuring crime when it started to show a continuous fall from the time @entity80 took office in 1997			1
yet here we have an admission from its own results that crime is 50 per cent higher than the figure it claims			0
’ @entity88 , of the @entity89 , said : ‘ public confidence in crime figures is vital and requires recording the full range of crimes consistently			2
' it is a mockery for a reputable crime survey to fail to count almost one in three offences			0
’ @entity80 ’s policing spokesman @entity98 said : ‘ if a member of the public is robbed , online or on the street , they are robbed and that should be recorded			0
’ the survey showed 211,344 frauds were recorded by police in @entity107 and @entity108 in the 12 months to the end of march , a rise of 17 per cent			0
there were also 333,600 frauds reported by the financial and retail sectors			0
@entity115 , of the @entity26 , said when it began the survey in the @entity118 fraud was not a high - value offence , adding : ‘ with the internet , fraud has exploded			2
in the past it was a long process to con money out of someone			0
’ crime prevention minister @entity124 said : ‘ it is incorrect to suggest the government has overlooked the scale of economic crime			0
we are committed to tackling fraud			0

@entity17 data *ignores* rapes , murders and crimes against children
also does not include up to 3.8million credit and bank card frauds
@entity26 interviews 40,000 people about their experiences with crime
