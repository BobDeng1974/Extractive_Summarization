by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 05:35 est , 6 may 2013 the @entity2 government has started negotiations to compensate thousands of @entity4 who claim they were subjected to appalling abuse by colonial authorities during the 1950s ' @entity8			1
the historic talks could mark the first compensation settlement resulting from official crimes committed under imperial rule , at a cost of millions of pounds to taxpayers			1
it could also lead to claims from other former colonies , such as @entity18 ( now @entity19 ) in @entity20 , and @entity21 in southern @entity22			0
the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) had originally said the @entity4 government was legally responsible for any mistreatment as all liabilities were transferred to the @entity27 when it formed in 1963 as @entity2 pulled out of @entity22			1
the @entity2 government has started negotiations to compensate thousands of @entity4 who claim they were subjected to appalling abuse by colonial authorities during the 1950s ' @entity8			1
above , @entity2 police guard @entity8 suspects in @entity32 , @entity4 in 1953 @entity4 @entity33 , left , @entity34 , and @entity35 , right , celebrate the announcement last october of a legal decision in their case at @entity2 's @entity40 @entity34 , left , @entity35 and @entity33 , right , claim they were victims of torture during the @entity8 in the 1950s but attempts by government lawyers to prevent elderly survivors of prison camps having their cases heard in @entity2 courts were scuppered after the discovery in 2011 of a huge archive of colonial documents which the @entity23 had kept hidden for decades			1
among the 8,000 documents - located at a repository in @entity54 , @entity55 - are accounts , written by colonial officials , of prisoners being ' roasted alive '			0
removed from @entity4 on the cusp of independence , the paperwork was uncovered in january of that year after five @entity4 launched a lawsuit against the @entity2 government			1
the claimants said they suffered castration , sexual abuse and severe beatings in detention camps administered by the @entity2 government and wanted an apology and financial compensation			1
the secret papers revealed that during the @entity8 - which saw tens of thousands die between 1952 - 60 - senior colonial officials authorised appalling mistreatment of inmates held at the prison camps			1
the documents also show that officials in @entity78 knew about the brutal actions of the detention regime			0
as details of the talks began to emerge last week , the @entity23 said it accepted the need to discuss @entity2 's past role			2
' it is an enduring feature of our democracy that we are willing to learn from our history , ' an @entity23 spokesman told the @entity91			2
as many as 10,000 former prisoners could receive compensation			0
although the individual amounts will vary greatly , the total compensation is likely to run into tens of millions of pounds			0
the @entity23 said that it would be ' inappropriate ' to discuss the talks			2
but in a prepared statement , it added : ' we understand the pain and grievance felt by those , on all sides , who were involved in the divisive and bloody events of the emergency period in @entity4			2
' it is right that those who feel they have a case are free to take it to the courts			0
' our relationship with @entity4 and its people has moved on and is characterised by close co-operation and partnership , building on the many positives from our shared history			2
" among the claimants are @entity120 , 84 , @entity35 , 85 , and @entity33 , 73 , who were held in detention camps during the 1950s			0
last october , the @entity40 rejected the government ’s claim that too much time had elapsed for there to be a fair trial , with mr @entity127 finding the three @entity4 had ‘ arguable cases in law ’			1
the @entity23 originally said the @entity4 government was legally responsible for any mistreatment as all liabilities were transferred to the @entity27 when it formed in 1963 as @entity2 pulled out of @entity22			1
above , men of the @entity134 check the identity of @entity22 during a raid in @entity137 in 1952 they claimants said they were subjected to ‘ appalling abuse ’ , including castration , beatings and sexual assaults			0
@entity144 said he was detained on christmas eve 1952 and imprisoned for nine years			0
he added that he was suspended by his feet and beaten unconscious in an incident in which 11 men were clubbed to death			0
he also claims cold water was poured on his face to stop him breathing			0
it was not until the @entity4 government lifted the ban on the @entity8 in 2002 that survivors started to consider legal action			1
and it took another six years before they asked the high court in @entity78 for permission to sue the @entity2 government for damages			0
@entity161 , the @entity163 ' special rapporteur on torture , has called on the government to ' provide full redress to the victims , including fair and adequate compensation '			2
along with two other former rapporterurs , he wrote : ' in our view , the response of the @entity2 government to vulnerable and elderly victims of ( acknowledged ) @entity2 torture is shameful			0
' last month , the @entity23 told the claimants ' lawyers , @entity177 , that it wished to adjourn the appeal and start negotiating a settlement .			1
