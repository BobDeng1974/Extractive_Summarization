what a disastrous festive period it has been for referees			1
they have sunk to their worst performance level that i can remember			0
it does not seem to matter who is appointed to which game as the majority of them cause controversy and ill - feeling			2
managers are not even bothering to speak to them after games as limp apologies or poor excuses do nothing to help them in a popular period for sackings			2
@entity36 heads up the @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , who are responsible for the officiating of top - flight games and he is therefore the man who is in charge of the select group of referees			1
if any team manager oversaw a festive period including as many errors as these by his players he would be sacked : the ball hits @entity50 ( right ) in the face but @entity26 gave @entity28 a penalty for handball referee @entity54 failed to send off @entity56 goalkeeper @entity55 for this handball outside of his area @entity58 ( right ) sends @entity59 flying during the match between @entity61 and @entity62 the ball clearly hits the arm of @entity66 defender @entity65 on the way through at @entity68 @entity69 ( right ) and his @entity71 team - mates complain to referee @entity54 at @entity72 's @entity73 ( centre left ) and @entity75 ( centre right ) argue following the incident at @entity78 @entity80 's @entity79 celebrates after scoring against @entity81 at the @entity82 @entity61 manager @entity83 reacts during his side 's @entity85 match against @entity87 referee @entity88 ( left ) shows @entity68 's @entity90 a yellow card at @entity91 on @entity85 alarmingly there are more errors than i have listed and in what is a very close and competitive @entity97 , these mistakes are starting to affect the look of the table			1
i 'm often asked why is n't there a no 1 referee who we turn to for the big games			0
well , that is @entity36 's call			1
he was never the no 1 when he reffed and he does n't like to put one man above another			0
there 's no real hierachy for @entity97 referees			1
@entity112 , the best referee in the country , was the fourth official at @entity114 vs @entity115 on @entity116			0
@entity36 ( centre ) referees the @entity97 match between @entity119 and @entity120 in 2007 he seems out of favour at the moment - probably because of off - the - field incidents , like breaking protocol by travelling in his own car to referee a match earlier this season because he wanted to watch an @entity128 concert			1
when he ’s on the pitch , he outperforms others			2
he is the obvious successor to @entity132 , but is currently working as technical director at the @entity38			2
this is a guy who has taken charge of a @entity138 final			0
surely he has much more to offer than @entity36 ? when raising the question of blatant errors with some officials , the response to me is worrying			1
i ’m told there is no confidence in the camp as they feel unsupported and not motivated			0
they tell me to expect more errors			0
as ever , @entity36 remains silent and this can not continue			2
i took great pride in doing my best to perform in every minute in every match and i am not enjoying highlighting so many errors			0
but at least i am doing my job			0
