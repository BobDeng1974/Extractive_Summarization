@entity1 's @entity0 will be restarted in march after a £ 97 million upgrade that could help solve some of the universe ’s greatest remaining mysteries			1
the world 's biggest particle collider , located near @entity7 in @entity8 , has been undergoing a two - year refit			1
its two proton beams — each with a diameter less than a third that of a human hair — will now contain energy equivalent to the detonation of 154 tons of @entity17			2
experts believe that the souped - up power will allow them to explore aspects of high - energy physics — such as dark matter , the suspected existence of new fundamental particles and gravity			2
it may even be possible to produce microscopic black holes			0
in 2012 , a less powerful version of the collider confirmed existence of the higgs boson particle , ' the @entity49 particle ' which explains how fundamental matter took on the mass to form stars and planets			1
it led to worldwide fame for @entity56 , an emeritus professor of physics at @entity58 , who first suggested it existed and shed tears as he was awarded the @entity61 for physics			0
that discovery was a landmark in physics but there are still plenty of other mysteries to be unraveled , including the nature of ' dark matter ' and ' dark energy '			0
mystery : how the @entity0 could delve into the universe 's deepest secrets and reveal the hidden mysteries that have baffled scientists new frontier : when experiments resume in 2015 , scientists at @entity1 will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter , dark energy and supersymmetry scientists : a year ago , the world 's largest particle collider made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science , identifying what is believed to be the @entity91 -- the long - sought maker of mass work is now ' in full swing ' to start circulating proton beams again in march , with the first collisions due by may , the @entity1 said			1
' with this new energy level , the ( collider ) will open new horizons for physics and for future discoveries , ' @entity1 director general @entity98 said in a statement			2
' i 'm looking forward to seeing what nature has in store for us			0
' @entity1 's collider is buried in a 27 - km ( 17 - mile ) tunnel straddling the @entity112 - @entity8 border at the foot of the @entity115 mountains			1
the entire machine is already almost cooled to 1.9 degrees above absolute zero in preparation for the next three - year run			1
the old machine had several drawbacks			0
however , there are many other unsolved questions that could now be answered			0
@entity124 mysterious dark matter is one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics			0
it can not be seen directly with telescopes ; and it does not emit or absorb light			0
the total mass – energy of the known universe contains 4.9 per cent ordinary matter and 27 per cent dark matter and 68.3 per cent dark energy			0
experts believe that the souped up power of the collider will allow them to make dark matter			2
@entity91 the existence of the @entity91 was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. theory has it that as the universe cooled after the @entity150 , an invisible force known as the @entity91 formed			1
this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles – or @entity56 bosons			0
as other particles pass through it , they pick up mass. in 2012 , a less powerful version of the collider confirmed existence of the higgs boson particle , which explains how fundamental matter took on the mass to form stars and planets			1
@entity169 - @entity169 is material composed of antiparticles , which have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but have opposite charge and other particle properties such as lepton and baryon number , quantum spin , etc. there should be as much anti matter as matter but it has disappeared			1
now scientists hope that the @entity0 could locate it			1
energy : the @entity0 's particle collisions transform energy into mass , the goal being to find fundamental particles in the sub-atomic debris that help us to understand the universe as engineers focus on the technical mission , physicists are sifting through data that the mighty atom smasher has churned out since 2010 these include the relative lack of antimatter in the universe , when equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created in the @entity150 13.8 billion years ago , and the possible existence of other new kinds of particles			1
@entity207 , a physics professor at the @entity208 said : ' we have unfinished business with understanding the universe			0
' @entity207 works on one of the four main experiments at the collider			2
@entity1 's work can baffle non-scientists , but researchers want to find ways to make it simple to understand the work done by the large @entity0			1
the new collider uses magnets to accelerate subatomic particles called protons to near light speed			2
each proton has similar energy to that of a small fly , but each bunch contains 115 billion protons and has as much energy as a 330 pound motorbike travelling at over 90 mph			0
there are 22,208 bunches in each beam and two beams travel in opposite directions through the tunnel and have the equivalent energy of the @entity241 train at maximum speed			0
scientists aim to smash the beams together inside detectors to recreate conditions similar to the conditions existing after billionths of a second after the @entity150			0
the latest @entity0 ( @entity0 ) replaced the @entity250 ( @entity250 ) , which ran from 1989 to 2000			2
it came online in 2008 , but ran into problems , forcing a year - long refit .			1

the world 's biggest particle collider is located near @entity7 , @entity8
it has been undergoing a two - year refit at a cost of £ 97 million
it was shut down in february 2013 , but will be *switched* on in march 2015
a year ago , the @entity0 identified the @entity91
physicists are sifting through data that it has churned out since 2010
