by @entity1 reporter published : 09:31 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 03:31 est , 27 may 2013 up to 100 patients a day are being forced to wait more than an hour in ambulances outside overstretched @entity5 units			1
more than 37,000 people needing urgent treatment were held in so - called ambulance ‘ jams ’ last year – with delays of up to four hours recorded at some hospitals			1
the latest number is more than double the 14,580 who waited to be admitted in 2010 - 11 , despite official guidelines that say patients should be handed over to medical staff within 15 minutes of arrival			1
waiting : in thousands of cases , ambulances are having to queue up outside hospitals with patients inside their vehicles because @entity5 units are too busy even the number of those stuck in ambulances for 30 minutes have increased – from 99,661 three years ago to 193,088 last year			1
the delays in treatment come as many @entity5 departments are struggling to cope with a surge in patient numbers			1
chaos in out - of - hours care and the botched launch of the government ’s 111 non-emergency number have also been accused of pushing many hospitals to breaking point			1
earlier this year , staff at @entity40 and @entity42 ’s emergency unit were so stretched they erected a tent in a car park to act as a makeshift ward			2
and in a leaked letter last week , 20 senior @entity5 doctors warned they could no longer guarantee safe care for patients			1
@entity51 , @entity52 ’s health spokesman , said hospitals had reached ‘ crisis point ’			1
closures : the devastating impact of casualties shutting across the nation delays : the ambulance service faces millions of pounds in fines if patients can not be delivered to @entity5 units ‘ the collapse of social care , which means older people can not be discharged back home , the failure of the new 111 helpline service , more than 4,000 nurses cut since the @entity73 and walk - in centre closures are all piling pressure onto @entity5 departments , ’ he said			1
‘ the result is patients waiting longer for treatment , being left on trolleys and unable to be transferred to wards because the beds are occupied			2
health secretary @entity83 : he blames gps for passing out of hours cases to unreliable private firms ‘ @entity87 is taking the @entity88 backwards , with ambulances queuing outside @entity5 and one hospital even having to erect a tent to receive patients			1
’ last week , @entity94 boss @entity93 also said emergency care was in a ‘ state of crisis ’ and called for patients to be able to email their gp instead of going to see them			2
however , health secretary @entity83 has blamed the problem on gps giving up responsibility for out - of - hours care and allowing care to be provided by unreliable private firms			1
the number of patients who waited longer than four hours in @entity5 has almost tripled in four years , from 344,772 in 2009 - 10 to 888,289 last year , @entity88 figures reveal			1
casualty units have been told to treat 95 per cent of patients within four hours , but almost a third of trusts failed to meet the target			1
an @entity114 spokesman said : ‘ while more than 90 per cent of @entity5 patients are seen within this time , waiting an average of 53 minutes , a high number of patients are still waiting longer than we would want			1
‘ there is no single cause or factor that can explain longer waits in @entity5 departments and issues vary from hospital to hospital			2
’ a @entity129 spokesman said the @entity88 is ‘ coping well ’ after the number of casualty patients rose by a million in three years			2
‘ patients should n’t face excessive waits for treatment and we expect @entity114 to take action to address ambulance handover times , including fining trusts when there are delays of 30 minutes or more , ’ he said			2
@entity141 is fleeing the town where she was born the campaigner who helped expose one of the country ’s worst @entity88 disasters has been hounded out of her home town			0
@entity141 , pictured , set up @entity148 the @entity88 when her mother @entity149 died in 2007 after appalling standards of care			0
miss @entity141 , 51 , called for an investigation into the @entity154 @entity88 trust			0
her campaign led to the inquiry which revealed that up to 1,200 patients had died needlessly			0
however , the cafe owner has now received a series of threats			0
many have unfairly blamed her for the uncertainty surrounding the future of the local hospital – one of the area ’s biggest employers			0
and residents have started to boycott her cafe			0
as a result , she has now decided she has no option but to leave the town where she was born			0
she said : ‘ people have been coming into the cafe shouting that nothing happened at @entity178 , that i am lying and that there were no unnecessary deaths			0
‘ my cafe is in ruins			0
it is taking in about £ 40 or £ 50 a day			0
i will be gone by the end of the summer			0
i ca n’t stay here any longer			0
’ miss @entity141 has previously told how the campaign saw her use up all her savings , endure abusive emails and receive telephone threats			0
revealing the source of her determination , she said : ‘ it was too late to save @entity195 – but i could save others by launching a @entity87 - versus - @entity198 battle to change the @entity88			2

overrun nurses and doctors were too busy to see 37,000 emergencies *quickly*
' the government has tried to blame everybody else for this chaos ' says @entity52
health secretary @entity83 claimed @entity5 units were *swamped* because @entity209 had handed out - of - hours services to unreliable private firms
