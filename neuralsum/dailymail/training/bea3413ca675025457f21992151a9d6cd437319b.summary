by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 has nominated @entity3 , pictured , as @entity6 's next @entity5 commissioner @entity8 chief @entity7 was accused of behaving like a dictator last night after warning he would snub @entity2 for not sending a woman to represent @entity6 in the @entity11			1
mr @entity7 indicated @entity6 could expect a lowly @entity13 post because of the prime minister ’s nomination of @entity3			1
sources said the incoming commission president , opposed by mr @entity2 , had repeatedly told countries he wanted to improve the gender balance of his top team			2
@entity21 yesterday rejected the call , saying @entity3 would be an ‘ excellent commissioner ’			1
@entity23 of @entity24 accused mr @entity7 of behaving like a dictator			2
the independent @entity26 said : ‘ his behaviour is unacceptable and the prime minister should not kowtow to this jumped - up bureaucrat with delusions of grandeur			0
‘ unfortunately , mr @entity7 ’s attitude is all too common among @entity11 officialdom which , in general , has contempt for democracy			1
’ @entity37 mps also rounded on mr @entity7			0
@entity38 said : ‘ how dare he tell us who the best person is for the job			0
it just demonstrates why people increasingly believe we should have nothing to do with this stupid , politically correct , elitist group of bureaucrats			0
‘ mr @entity7 should simply butt out			0
he needs to understand that the more they make these ridiculous decisions … the more clamour there will be among the @entity6 public for us to simply get out			2
’ fellow @entity37 @entity54 said it would be an outrage if @entity6 was refused a major economic portfolio in the commission because of the gender of its candidate			0
he added : ‘ perhaps mr @entity7 has forgotten the @entity6 is a net contributor to the @entity11 budget , therefore we should be getting one of the big jobs			1
’ mr @entity7 has been clear since his selection in july that he wants more female commissioners			1
in an interview with @entity69 newspaper @entity68 this week he said countries which failed to heed his warning could not expect senior jobs			0
@entity2 has been warned that @entity6 will not get a top @entity8 post unless the @entity28 sends a woman ‘ a commission without a significant number of women is , in my view , neither legitimate nor credible , ’ he said			1
‘ that is why i am continuing to insist with several heads of state and governments that they send me a female candidate … should there still not be a sufficient number of women , i will need to redress the balance through the portfolio allocation			0
‘ female commissioners will then certainly have very good chances of landing an important portfolio or of getting one of the most sought - after posts of vice-president , acting as my deputies			2
’ @entity8 sources acknowledged mr @entity7 ’s comments were aimed partly at mr @entity2			1
but @entity97 yesterday said the commission president had not directly raised concerns about @entity3 ’s gender in recent weeks .			0

the *pm* has been warned that @entity8 wants more female commissioners
@entity7 said @entity6 risks being *sidelined* if a man is nominated
@entity2 said @entity3 would make an excellent @entity11 commissioner
