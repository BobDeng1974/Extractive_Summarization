seven months after a win which triggered all manner of talk about horses of different sizes , @entity0 goes back to @entity6 astride a more formidable beast			1
@entity8 can go seven points clear of the champions if they win			1
but his centre forward is lame and @entity0 is hard to please on the quest for perfection			1
yes , there has been progress , he admits , but it is a delicate balance			2
@entity0 is not fully content with his squad despite their impressive start to the season @entity8 , pictured celebrating @entity22 's goal against @entity23 , have been in scintillating form ‘ i am not happy with what we have , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ everything i want to make better , everything			2
we are in the beginning of our second season			2
we are far from being the perfect team			2
‘ are we better than last season ? we believe so			0
do we have more potential than before ? i believe so			0
we have improved our team and our squad			0
but we still have lot of work to do			0
in this kind of competition , with the quality of opposition we have and the number of teams fighting for the same objectives , it ’s going to be very hard			0
‘ i ’m not saying we have problems			0
we have big space to improve			0
players individually have big space to improve			0
we have lots to learn tactically			0
i do n’t think i ’ve ever been completely happy with my team			2
’ @entity8 are searching for a balance			1
they have been prolific in attack but prone to leaking goals and the fitness of @entity55 is the big concern			1
with his extra power up front , @entity8 started the season in formidable style			1
while title rivals dropped points , fretted about @entity65 hangovers and struggled for rhythm , @entity0 ’s team won the first four and @entity55 scored seven goals			1
then came confirmation that he was still troubled by the hamstring problem which surfaced at the end of last season			0
he did not start in the @entity72 against @entity73 on wednesday and it could limit his activity for a few weeks			0
@entity55 will start against @entity6 but will miss his side 's @entity76 match against @entity78 @entity8 club doctor @entity79 has been tasked with monitoring @entity55 's fitness closely @entity55 will start at the @entity81 , @entity0 confirmed , but will not feature in the @entity76 tie against @entity78 on wednesday , then return to face @entity83 next saturday			1
he will continue this way in the hope the issue can be treated during the week and improved			0
does he need a couple of weeks ’ off ? ‘ yes , ’ nodded @entity0			1
but you want him to play ? ‘ yes			0
’ is it a risk ? ‘ yes			2
’ but he ’s so important			0
‘ yes , he is			0
’ so , it is a calculated risk ? ‘ yes , me , him and the doctor , the decision is made between us , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity55 is not in the best condition but he will start the game			1
clearly , we have to try and protect him until he is completely fit			0
‘ what we can do to improve the situation , we have to do when he ’s not playing			0
he needs work , not just from the medical department but also on the pitch and in the gym			0
’ those who saw @entity55 train on friday claimed it was impossible to tell he was carrying an injury			1
but if the hamstring goes , it will leave @entity0 to choose between 36 - year - old @entity112 or @entity113 at centre forward			1
@entity112 ( left ) or @entity113 ( right ) will deputise for @entity55 when the @entity116 international is not fully fit @entity113 scored on his debut but the @entity8 boss prefers a more combative player to lead the line			1
last season , when asked to assess @entity6 ’s strengths , he remarked on the quality of their ‘ third striker ’ @entity124			1
when @entity126 suffered injuries , @entity124 stepped forward , took responsibility and last month signed a new contract as @entity130 was loaned to @entity131			0
@entity55 has helped @entity8 add potency up front , but @entity0 has also loosened his team at the @entity135 have conceded six in the first four @entity138 games for the first time since 2003 when @entity140 was in charge			1
four years ago , under @entity142 , they started the season with five wins which ground to a halt with defeat at the @entity81			2
@entity147 could come up against his former side after sealing a shock loan move to rivals @entity6 @entity150 is said to be pleased with the west @entity153 side 's performances so far this season another defeat on saturday , especially one inspired by @entity147 — allowed to leave @entity155 by @entity0 , who thought he was bound for the @entity156 , not the @entity81 — would test the mood of owner @entity150			1
‘ i work for him , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i can not knock on his door or call him and ask : “ mr @entity150 , are you happy ? ” but my feeling is yes			1
‘ when i see him hugging his kids after a @entity8 goal , it ’s easy to understand he ’s enjoying it			2
’ surely he is happier than @entity172 , the owner of @entity6 , who has seen his team labour and star players misfire			1
‘ they are the same as last season , ’ said @entity0 , when asked to assess @entity6			1
‘ they have brought in three or four important players			0
they have a fantastic squad and are not just the champions , but champions twice in three years			2
there ’s a reason for that			0
‘ @entity8 have not won the @entity138 for a few years now			2
that is also for some reason			0

@entity8 take on @entity6 at the @entity81 on *sunday*
@entity0 will risk @entity55 against the league champions
the @entity8 boss believes owner @entity150 is happy with his early side 's form
