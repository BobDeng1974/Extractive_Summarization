by @entity0 mafia mobsters are not all psychopaths despite their reputation for being gangsters who kill , traffic drugs and kidnap , a new study claims			2
@entity10 researchers @entity8 and colleagues , who are based in the birthplace of the mafia @entity14 , went to a prison in @entity16 to interview 30 convicted mobsters			1
they questioned 39 prisoners in the same institution who were jailed for non gang - related crimes			2
the researchers then used the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) to determine whether any of the subjects showed psychotic characteristics			1
@entity28 as @entity29 in @entity30 ( 1972 )			0
researchers have found that of 30 mafia mobsters they interviewed , none showed psychopathic characteristics the 20 - item list of personality traits and recorded behaviors associated with psychopathy - such as pathological lying , lack of empathy and an impulsive nature - is a common assessment used to determine whether someone has the personality disorder			1
interviewees are assessed and given a score - with those marked above 30 being deemed a psychopath			1
the researchers discovered that none of the @entity53 members they questioned scored over 30			1
conversely , 10 per cent of the comparative group did			0
the report observed of the mafia members : ' this means that they were less ‘ manipulative ’ , ‘ machiavellian ’ , ‘ narcissistic ’ , ‘ unemotional ’ , ‘ parasitic ’ and / or ‘ impulsive ’ than the other participants			0
' further , during the interviews , they often expressed concerns for their children and their families , and they had never ceased to write and call them			0
such expressions of attachment were less apparent among the comparison men			0
' even criminal actions for most of the @entity53 members were led by loyalty to their families or adherence to the family ’s ‘ mission ’ rather than personal interest			0
@entity16 , @entity14 - where the researchers who conducted the study , @entity8 and colleagues , are based ' it is possible that these individuals compartmentalized their lives and behaviors – on the one side , the @entity53 affairs , on the other side , their positive feelings and affects towards relatives and friends			1
' the study also noted that @entity53 members are less likely to have substance abuse problems than others in prison			0
of the mafia members , the researchers found 57 per cent had been jailed for violent offenses , 23 per cent for murder and the remainder for crimes such as kidnapping , trafficking drugs and fraud .			2
