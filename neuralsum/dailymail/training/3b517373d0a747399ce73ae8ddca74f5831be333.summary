@entity0 has unveiled its latest method of crowd control - a ray gun likened to a ' human microwave ' which gives its target the excruciating sensation of feeling like they 're on fire			1
operating on similar principles to a microwave , the @entity11 - 1 projects a wave beam up to a range of 80metres that causes movement in water and fat molecules just below the skin			1
despite the extreme burning pain felt by those shot , the weapon is completely non-lethal , leaves no lasting damage and the pain subsides immediately when moved off the person			1
@entity0 's @entity26 ( pictured ) leaves no lasting damage but makes its target feel like they 're on fire the @entity31 used a recent air show to reveal its new weapon , and claimed its range could be increased to up to a kilometre , @entity30 's reported			1
it is remarkably similar to a weapon briefly deployed by the @entity39 military in @entity40 in 2010 that was withdrawn after concerns it could be used against the @entity39 in a propaganda war			0
however , the weapon - called the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) - also required 16 hours to warm up before use			2
the futuristic device has long been popular with authorities as a means of effective crowd control because of its ability to repel groups of people without leaving any visible marks or injuries			2
it was described in @entity57 as ' the next hurdle for non-lethality '			0

new weapon for crowd control has been likened to a ' human microwave '
the @entity11 - 1 beam creates movement in water molecules under the skin
it causes an excruciating burning sensation that targets find *unbearable*
but the weapon is completely non-lethal and causes no lasting damage
