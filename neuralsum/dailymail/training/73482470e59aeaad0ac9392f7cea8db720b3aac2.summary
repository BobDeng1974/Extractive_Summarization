by @entity0 forty - somethings who ca n't afford to rent or buy a home on their own are turning to flatshares with people half their age , new figures reveal			0
the combination of divorce and rising house prices are said to be to blame for a massive rise in middle - aged people looking to rent rooms in a friends - style house full of strangers			1
websites for would - be flat - sharers say the number of people aged 40 - plus looking for rooms has surged in the last five years , with one reporting a doubling of enquiries from over- 40s since 2009			1
friends : a decade ago , the @entity26 sitcom portrayed 20 - somethings sharing , but now the over- 40s are doing it , too @entity29 , of @entity30 , said : ' one in eight wanted ads on our website comes from the over- 40s , which equates to 60,000 people that age looking for rooms in the past year			1
' that figure has gone up from 40,000 five years ago , representing a 50 per cent increase			2
' he said : ' the reasons for them wanting to share a room is split between those whose relationships have broken down and those who ca n't afford to get onto the property ladder			0
' our society is geared towards couples - it is the same price to rent or buy a one - bedroom flat for a couple or a person on their own , so for someone newly - single in their 40s , it is very difficult to afford to live on their own			0
' given that the average age of people using his site is 28 , it means the older flat - sharers may end up living with people half their age			2
mr @entity29 said that while the number of advertisements posted by 40 - somethings had soared , he believed the true figure of those looking to share accommodation was far higher			0
he said : ' some 40 - somethings are too embarrassed to post an ad , fearing their age might put potential flat - mates off			0
' instead , they just respond to ads , hoping that once they 've met the younger flat - mates , they will see that they will all get on			0
' house prices are rising , so now even the middle - aged are finding it hard to get onto the property ladder @entity87 , of @entity88 , said his website had also noticed more middle - aged people flat - sharing			1
he said : ' we 've noticed a growing number of people in their 40s and older choosing to flat - share , and the number of 40 - plus renters registered with us now accounts for 13 per cent of the total number of people searching for a room			1
' he said marriage break - ups and financial constraints were a factor , but said they also attributed it to older renters having to work in @entity106 while their family live outside the capital			2
' nearly a quarter of all our 40 - plus flat - sharers are searching for a room in @entity106 where they work during the week , and they then go back and spend the weekends with their families ' he said			1
mr @entity87 said the current average flat - share rent across the @entity114 was £ 390 , while the average rent was £ 745			1
he said : ' the vast different in asking prices clearly shows why growing numbers of people are choosing to flatshare instead of live alone			0
' mr @entity87 said that as long as property prices - to buy or to rent - continue to increase , he predicts that flatsharing will continue to grow in popularity .			0
