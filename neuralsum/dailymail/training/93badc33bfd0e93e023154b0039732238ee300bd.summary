by @entity0 published : 11:07 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 8 february 2013 a clifftop house that was bought at auction without being seen or surveyed by the buyer has started to collapse after the latest in a series of devastating landslides			1
@entity6 , which lies just yards from the edge of @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , has now begun to crumble and sag			1
it made the news three years ago when a landslide hit it just a week after the six - bedroom property had been sold at auction to retired police officer @entity16 for £ 154,000			1
now , it is on the verge of total obliteration after the most recent landslide caused a large portion of it to collapse			2
miss @entity16 , who is disabled , made a telephone bid of £ 154,500 for the house in february 2010 , without viewing it or having a survey done			1
eight days later , a landslide left the 1930s house just 50 yards from a drop into the sea , and a lengthy legal battle began between her and the builder who sold it to her , @entity48			1
at the time @entity49 , who suffers from dyslexia , impaired hearing and restricted mobility , said the house was uninhabitable and worth only £ 3,500			2
the auction particulars had warned buyers that the house was severely structurally damaged and might be beyond economic repair , and a judge in 2010 ordered @entity49 to pay mr @entity48 what she owed			1
mr @entity48 has a legal charge for the money , plus eight per cent interest annually , over @entity49 's home in @entity65 , @entity66 , which she says is worth over £ 1million			1
explaining her decision to buy the house in @entity9 , she said her @entity65 home had been flooded by burst pipes and she thought the ground floor of the seaside property would be ideal for a disabled person			1
just before the most recent landslide in @entity9 , a man who lives near the clifftop house explained why he was selling up			2
going , going : @entity6 looks like it wo n't last much longer following the latest incident in the three - year story of a collapsing dream home before the clifftop began crumbling into the sea , @entity6 was an attractive 1930s - built seaside residence of grand proportions @entity85 , 68 , whose neighbouring property is for sale , said : ' we 're selling up because it is too big for us and we 're going to downsize in @entity9			1
' we have lived here nine years and love it here but it is too much for us to manage			0
' so many people have come to view it			0
our neighbours moved here earlier this year so they were n't put off by the risk of a landslide			2
i do n't think it will go for years			0
' another neighbour , a 40 - year - old woman who did n't want to be named , said she has been renting her house since march			0
she said : ' we came here because of the location and the house : it 's got a great sea view			0
' we did n't know anything about the landslide , we found out from neighbours			0
there are concerns about @entity6 being derelict because it encourages people			2
' it 's a bit of a tourist attraction at weekends : lots of kids come and nose around the house			0
' we are all concerned about potential increased burglary , and we 've had to call the police a couple of times because of kids hanging around acting suspiciously			0
' the possibility of a major landslide worries me slightly			0
i would n't buy this place because of the risk			0
it 's quite a way from the edge , but if there 's another one or two landslides these houses will be next to go			0
' doomed : the property ( seen here in 2010 ) was sold to @entity49 by a builder , @entity48 , who has been engaged in a legal battle with her ever since the house 's garden fell down the cliff a week after she bought it			1

@entity6 was bought at auction by @entity16 without her viewing or having a survey done on the house
eight days after the auction in february 2010 , a landslide left the 1930s house just 50 yards from the edge of the cliff
miss @entity16 then began a lengthy legal battle with @entity48 , the builder who sold her the house in @entity9
now the 1930s property that disabled @entity49 had hoped to retire in has begun to collapse and crumble
