but the shape of this formation above a beach near @entity9 is easy to spot			0
the unusual wave like clouds were spotted above @entity12 on @entity14 beach this afternoon by photographer @entity15			2
the crest - shaped cloud formation is caused by a series of water , damp and windy conditions coming together at the same time at about 5,000 meters in the air			0
the @entity22 cloud wave above @entity23 , @entity9 , today a @entity25 forecaster explains : ' it looks like a @entity27			1
' when you have different layers of air travelling at different speeds , along with changes in temperature and density , then it can lead to this wave - like formation			1
' the air higher up overlaps the slower - moving air below - but it is the changes in temperature and density which creates the shape			2
' it is fairly uncommon to see such a clear example of it			2
' the wave clouds are not uncommon , as seen in @entity9 today , but says a @entity25 forecaster : ' it is fairly uncommon to see such a clear example of it ' photographer and weather buff mr @entity15 , who lives in the north of @entity51 , and who took these pictures , added : ' i was photographing the sea and the surfers off @entity57 when i looked up about 40 degrees and saw the waves in the clouds			1
' i knew what they were , and that they 're fairly rare , caused by turbulence about 5,000 meters up in the air			0
' i 'd seen them on tv before , but not in real life			0
they were n't there for very long - only about 30 seconds and then they were gone			0

the @entity22 wave take shape when layers of air travel at different speeds and are *impacted* by changes in temperatures and density
@entity25 : ' the clouds are not uncommon , but it is rare to see such a clear picture of them '
