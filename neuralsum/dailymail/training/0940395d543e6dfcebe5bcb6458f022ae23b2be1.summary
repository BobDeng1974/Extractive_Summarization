by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity2 must make room for almost 10million more people over the next 25 years , according to official estimates yesterday			1
the increase , mainly a result of immigration and high migrant birthrates , will push numbers in the country to 73.3million by 2037			1
it means @entity13 , already the most crowded country in @entity15 , needs to accommodate the equivalent of a city bigger than @entity18 in the next two and a half decades			1
packed : @entity13 needs to accommodate the equivalent of a city bigger than @entity18 in the next 25 years as the population of @entity2 is set to soar by 10 million border control : the population is set to hit 73.3 million in 2037 with migration and particularly immigration from @entity15 cited as the main cause the controversial milestone of 70million – which one minister in the last @entity30 government promised would never happen – is likely to be reached in 2027 , according to the @entity32 projections			1
there will be 4.3million extra people over just ten years between 2012 and 2022			1
the projections show that despite a reduction in the scale of immigration , there has been no easing up of the rate at which the population is increasing			2
the population is set to hit 73.3million in 2037 – 9.6 million higher than the 63.7 million estimated in the middle of last year			1
migration and particularly immigration from @entity15 is cited as the main cause			0
by comparison , the population rose by 6.8 million in the past 25 years			1
even though ‘ net migration ’ – the amount by which migration pushes the population up every year – is falling as a result of tighter government restrictions , the population estimates have not come down as a result			2
baby boom : on average over the next 25 years , every woman will have 1.88 children , the projections said , compared to the 1.84 figure in the 2010 estimates this is because the @entity32 discovered in the 2011 national census that it had under - counted numbers in the country by almost 500,000			1
the great majority of the missed people were migrants from @entity71 and @entity15 who arrived after 2004 , and whose arrival had never been officially noticed			0
other factors pushing the estimates up are rising life expectancy and rising fertility rates			0
on average over the next 25 years , every woman will have 1.88 children , the projections said , compared to the 1.84 figure in the 2010 estimates			1
the key reason for increasing fertility is immigration , because immigrants have higher birthrates than the existing population			2
the @entity32 estimates say that 43 per cent of the future population increase will be a direct result of numbers of people coming in to the country , but when migrant birthrates are counted in , immigration will contribute 60 per cent of population increase			1
growing numbers will mean heavy demands on public services , especially housing , at a time when prices are already unaffordable for many young people			1
control : home secretary @entity103 has succeeded in reducing net migration , and immigration minister @entity105 , right			0
says it is still important to control immigration because of its effect on public services and jobs pressure : growing numbers will mean heavy demands on public services , especially housing , at a time when prices are already unaffordable for many young people packed : the growing population will also affect transport , including trains , education , water and power supplies they will also affect transport , education , water and power supplies , and will pile on pressure for building over the green spaces in the most overcrowded parts of the country			1
sir @entity131 of the @entity133 pressure group said : ‘ these latest projections confirm that we are still on course for a continued and substantial increase in population			2
' by the end of the next @entity141 the population will have increased by 3 million			2
this underlines the absolute need to have a net migration target and stick to it			0
’ home secretary @entity103 has succeeded in reducing net migration – the number of people migrating into the country minus the number who leave – to 176,000 last year , compared to 225,000 at its peak			0
however immigrant numbers rose because of a new wave of people arriving from high - unemployment countries in southern @entity15			0
ministers are powerless to curb immigration from the @entity160 , and are concerned over what will happen when restrictions on the working rights of citizens of @entity165 and @entity166 are lifted in the @entity167			0
immigration minister @entity105 said : ‘ immigration has brought benefits to the @entity2 and we welcome people who want to come here to contribute to our economy and society			0
' however , it is important to control immigration because of its effect on social cohesion , our public services , and on jobs and wages			0
‘ we have already overhauled the immigration rules , tightening the routes where abuse was rife			0
’ @entity30 mp @entity185 and @entity187 @entity186 , of the cross-party group on @entity189 , said : ‘ these latest projections confirm the rapid growth in our population resulting mainly from the large - scale immigration of recent years			2
‘ they underline the need to bring net migration sharply down			0

population will rise from *63.7million* in 2012 to 73.3million by 2037
increase is larger than the entire population of @entity18 today
on average over the next 25 years , every woman will have 1.88 children
growing numbers will mean heavy demands on services and housing
