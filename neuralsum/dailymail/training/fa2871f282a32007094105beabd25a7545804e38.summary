@entity8 also had sex with the victim in his marital home in the same week his wife miscarried			1

@entity8 's solictor @entity42 said : ' what i can tell you at this stage , is that not only is he planning to appeal , we actually lodged the appeal with the @entity49 well before @entity50			1
' it was the advice given to his legal advisors that he should lodge an appeal against conviction			0
i lodged it within 14 days of his conviction			0
' during the trial he told the court that his victim , now 19 , is a ' vain stalker ' who made the relationship up because she is a ' psychopathic liar ' who thought ' everyone fancies her			1
' @entity8 claimed the girl had stalked him and used details gleaned from calendars , computers and gadgets in his office to construct ' a fantasy '			2
his defence barrister @entity74 said : ' he 's a man who did n't look behind his back , and he was stalked , and information was found out about him for this carefully constructed elaborate ruse			2
why ? we do n't know			0
' but the jury did not accept his claims , and convicted him last month			2
last night the step - mother of the girl accused of grooming her teacher into having sex with her said she has been treated as a criminal rather than a victim			1
her comments came as it was announced that the judge who spared @entity91 teacher @entity8 a jail sentence is to be investigated			1
during a two - week trial , the court heard that @entity8 had carried around a condom for a week , telling the girl he would use it on her when she became ' too irresistible ' the vice-principal at @entity14 in south - east @entity15 also took her to his home when his wife was at work and had sex with her in their guest bedroom mrs justice @entity18 told him : ' there is no evidence that you groomed her ... it was she who groomed you and you gave in to temptation			1
' the stepmother of the girl , who is now 19 , told the @entity113 : ' he 's the one who 's committed the crime , and yet she 's the one who was treated like a criminal in that courtroom			1
' she said the girl was ' devastated ' by the sentence			0
' what kind of a message does that send out ? ' she added			0
' you can sleep with a schoolgirl and you 'll just get away with it ? that 's disgusting			0
' he was in the position of trust and he was the responsible adult			0
how could it be her fault ? how can you blame a 16 - year - old schoolgirl ? we 're all still in shock			1
' the teacher slept with her , then called her a s * * * and he 's been allowed to get away with it			2
' during a two - week trial , the court heard that @entity8 had carried around a condom for a week , telling the girl he would use it on her when she became ' too irresistible '			2

last night , there was a growing backlash against the judge 's decision			2
@entity188 's executive director of children 's services @entity187 said : ' this is the wrong use of the word grooming , it 's the wrong message to teachers , parents and pupils , and it 's wrong to suggest that a vulnerable child is in any way responsible for their own abuse			0
' a law firm also warned that judges should n't blame victims for the crimes of those who are in a position of trust			0
@entity208 , a solicitor with the firm , @entity208 , said : ' the teacher was in a position of trust , and no matter what the girl was saying or doing , he should have realised the danger and the inappropriateness of it all , and stopped it			0
' he was the one in a position of power , and it was a breach of trust			0
' you ca n't blame the victim			0

meanwhile , members of the public vented their frustrations on @entity253			0

# @entity255 failed as a teacher / mentor to protect a student and pre-planned the acts			2
' the @entity269 tweeted : ' v disturbed by judge 's comment that the pupil had * groomed * her ex-teacher @entity8			1
children do n't groom adults ! # childsexabuse ' on the day of the sentencing , the attorney general 's office said that it was considering whether to refer the sentence to the @entity49			0
yesterday , however , it emerged that it is powerless to do so because his offence is not included in the unduly lenient sentences scheme			0
judge @entity18 , 64 , has 40 years ' experience as a barrister , according to her profile on the @entity290 website			1
