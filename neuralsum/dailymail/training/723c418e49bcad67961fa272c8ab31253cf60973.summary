second thoughts : @entity4 , who acted as a sperm donor for a lesbian couple in 2009 and gave up parental rights , is being chased by @entity24 for $ 6,000 in child support backing : @entity6 said today that mr @entity4 had her complete support in fighting the state department and that she and her former partner @entity7 were eternally grateful to him for giving them a daughter mr @entity4 wanted to help the couple and along with his wife @entity31 turned down their payment of $ 50 to donate his sperm for free			1

in return , he gave up parental rights including financial duties for the child			2
ms @entity6 also spoke to the today show on thursday about her gratitude to mr @entity4 and how they supported him in his fight against @entity15 state			1
she said : ' we never intended for him [ @entity4 ] to support her			2

the couple adopted eight children together during their relationship but have not been given the same rights as straight couples battle : @entity6 and former partner @entity7 ( right ) are supporting their sperm donor @entity4 in his fight against paying child support for their daughter @entity90 spokeswoman @entity89 said on wednesday that when a single mother seeks benefits for a child , the department routinely tries to determine the child 's paternity and require the father to make support payments to lessen the potential cost to taxpayers			1
she argued that the law regarding artificial insemination is an incentive for donors and prospective mothers to work with a doctor			0
' i believe that is the intent of the law , so that we do n't end up with these ambiguous situations , ' she said			0
@entity6 and @entity7 updated @entity4 on their daughter 's well - being occasionally but he has had little contact , according to the @entity114			1
the arrangement changed earlier this year when ms @entity7 , the only parent registered on her daughter 's birth certificate , applied for social welfare			1
ms @entity6 had been supporting the child but was left unable to work due to ill health			2
on october 3 , 2012 , attorney @entity121 filed a petition on behalf of the @entity123 seeking a ruling that @entity4 is the father of @entity7 's child and owes a duty to support her			1
it said the department provided cash assistance totaling $ 189 for the girl for july through september 2012 , and had paid medical expenses totaling nearly $ 6,000			0
@entity7 had allegedly been put under pressure to reveal mr @entity4 's name so that her daughter could continue to have health care			1
the legal agreement that the three made in 2009 was deemed invalid by @entity24 because they did not use a certified doctor for the insemination			2
it may appear unconventional but searching for sperm donors on @entity8 is not unheard of			0
in 2010 , the popular cafemom blog lit up in outrage after a man from @entity145 , @entity141 advertised his sperm donor services on @entity8			0

ms @entity6 and ms @entity7 , who separated in 2010 , plan to help mr @entity4 fight the state 's decision			1
@entity181 , mr @entity4 's attorney , argued that the case was consistent with a 2007 case in which the @entity184 denied parental rights to a man who sought them after providing a sperm donation under similar circumstances			1
a licensed physician performed the insemination in the 2007 case			0
@entity181 wrote that @entity4 took the same actions as the man in the 2007 case did , and he - like that man - should be considered a sperm donor , not a father			2
she stressed that sperm banks regularly ship donations for the intended purpose of artificial insemination within the @entity201 and abroad to both residential and medical facility addresses			0
@entity181 argued in court documents that if a donor is free of parental responsibility only when a doctor performs an insemination , ' then any woman in @entity15 could have sperm donations shipped to her house , inseminate herself without a licensed physician and seek out the donor for financial support because her actions made him a father , not a sperm donor			1
' this goes against the very purpose of the statute to protect sperm donors as well as birth mothers '			0
ms @entity6 and ms @entity7 had been together for eight years and adopted eight children			1
they ended their relationship in 2010 but continue to co-parent their sons and daughters who range from three months to 25 years old			0
the state of @entity15 does not recognize same - sex unions , so each of their children was registered for adoption by a single parent			2
a motion to dismiss the state 's case will be heard in @entity238 on january 8			0
moving on : @entity7 posted this picture with a man believed to be her new partner since the end of her relationship with @entity6			1
