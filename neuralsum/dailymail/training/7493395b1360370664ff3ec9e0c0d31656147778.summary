he may be football 's archetypal bad boy , but @entity2 proved he 's not too cool for school by posting a heart warming good luck message to youngsters heading back to class this week			1
the @entity9 striker took to his @entity11 account to send the message : ' hi kids , today starts school in most countries			2
it 's like the beginning of the season in football			0
