by @entity0 , deputy political editor for @entity1 and @entity2 , @entity3 political editor @entity5 defector @entity4 is on course to romp home as @entity9 ’s first member of parliament , a new poll suggested last night			1
a survey of more than 1,000 voters in the @entity14 constituency of @entity15 put support for mr @entity4 – who quit as its conservative mp last week to stand for @entity9 – on 56 percentage points , well ahead of the @entity19 on 24 points			1
@entity21 is on 16 points while the @entity23 are on a miserable two percentage points , according to the poll commissioned by former @entity5 deputy chairman @entity26			2
former @entity5 mp @entity4 ( right ) is runaway favourite to retain his @entity15 seat in @entity29 for @entity9 ‘ even allowing for some movement in vote shares as the campaign unfolds , the likely outcome is clear , ’ said lord @entity26			1
‘ what happens to the seat at the general election seven months later is rather less settled			0
as things stand , the indication is that @entity4 could hold the seat , but perhaps with a reduced majority			0
’ mr @entity4 has claimed it does not matter if his defection to @entity9 helps @entity43 into @entity44 – because there is no difference between @entity21 and the @entity19			1
mr @entity4 , who shocked @entity47 by calling a snap by - election after leaving the @entity19 last week , said mr @entity43 would not be ‘ that different ’ from @entity50 as prime minister			1
his remarks , amid @entity5 anger over his defection to @entity9 , came after it was announced the by - election in @entity15 would take place on october 9 – mr @entity50 ’s 48th birthday			1
a poll released today suggested mr @entity4 will easily hold the @entity14 seat			1
the @entity9 candidate is backed by 56 per cent of voters in the constituency - 32 points ahead of the @entity19			1
the crunch electoral test comes just a week after the @entity19 ' annual conference in @entity65			2
mr @entity4 will be the first person elected to @entity29 for @entity9			1
the party 's only previous mp , @entity66 , did not seek a fresh mandate when he defected from the @entity19 in 2008			2
he lost his seat at @entity70 , @entity14 in 2010			0
mr @entity4 had been @entity5 mp for @entity15 since 2010 , having previously served as mp for @entity71 from 2005 to 2010 before boundary changes			1
@entity9 leader @entity73 has said a by - election win for his party in @entity15 would signal a ‘ landslide in @entity78 politics ’			1
a @entity80 poll for @entity81 gave @entity9 a massive 44 - point lead over @entity50 's party			1
but mr @entity4 said he was not concerned that his defection would damage the @entity19			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t fundamentally believe that on most of the macro issues , an @entity43 government would be that different from a @entity50 government			2
different cliques , same sofa			0
’ he said the former @entity21 minister @entity91 ‘ started welfare ’ and the government ’s education reforms were actually initiated by @entity94			0
mr @entity4 added : ‘ there are some very nice socialists			2
if it was n’t for socialism we would n’t have the @entity100			0
they have done some good things , the @entity102 in this country			0
’ mr @entity4 also pledged to vote for a referendum if mr @entity50 was prime minister			1
he said : ‘ i can promise you if i ’m a member of parliament in the run - up to 2017 , mr @entity50 and his whips if he ’s still prime minister can count on me to help ensure the legislation goes through			1
‘ i give him that guarantee now			0
as for letting @entity21 in : in @entity15 if you vote @entity9 you ’re going to get @entity9			2
so that argument does n’t stack up here			0
’ a government under @entity43 would not be ' that different ' to one ran by @entity50 , mr @entity4 has claimed mr @entity4 said he would not have left the @entity19 if he thought the party leadership was serious about change			1
he said the @entity5 had become the ‘ property of a small clique ’			0
he said he visited a conference in march , attended by senior government officials , who were dismissive of serious reform of the @entity123			2
mr @entity4 said : ‘ i thought the government was serious about change			2
and i sat in rooms listening to some very senior people , who unlike me are not democratically accountable , who clearly decide things , and who were just contemptuously dismissive			0
‘ and when i raised very mild suggestions and put some questions , or even when i was just listening , they were smirkingly , eyeball - rollingly contemptuous of even the most modest treaty reforms			0
‘ there was almost a sense of ‘ we know best ’			0
and yes we ’ve got to say these things to the voters because of course you know the prime minister has got to win the next election , because you know , rest assured , we do n’t mean it and it ’s not going to happen			0
‘ that was a key moment , and it ’s a key moment i can talk about in fairly specific terms without breaching confidences			0
if i give you other key moments you ’ll know who i ’m talking about and that would n’t be fair			0
’ mr @entity4 holds a 44 point lead over the conservatives in the former @entity5 safe seat of @entity15 the @entity19 have yet to announce their candidate for next month ’s by - election			1
@entity159 mayor @entity158 brushed off suggestions he should put his name forward , telling @entity163 radio : ‘ the first objection really , is that i 've already whacked in the cv for @entity166			0
it would seem a bit eccentric			0
