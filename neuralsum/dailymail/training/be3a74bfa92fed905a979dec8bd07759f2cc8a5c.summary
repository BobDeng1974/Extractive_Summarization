@entity0 pulled off a stunning upset to dethrone @entity2 and win the @entity4 welterweight world title on saturday night			1
the @entity6 star recovered from a slow start in @entity8 to gradually impose himself on the unbeaten champion			2
one judge scored the fight level but the other two marked it in @entity0 's favour , albeit by flattering margins of 117 - 111 and 116 - 112			1
a cut opened up above @entity0 's left eye as early as the second round but it was clear from the initial exchanges that the @entity44 was landing the cleaner shots			0
in the face of the champion 's smothering tactics however , @entity0 was unable to put his combinations together as @entity2 took advantage of a weak referee to lead with his head			1
but by the halfway stage , the 26 - year - old from @entity54 began to tire and a second clash of heads left him too cut above his eye			0
@entity0 , who saw three title fights with then champion @entity36 cancelled through injury in 2013 , began to impose himself as @entity2 struggled to display the power that stopped @entity62 in brutal fashion four months ago			1
and the new : @entity0 shows his delight after the judges scored him the winner against @entity2 just champion : @entity0 celebrates after being crowned world champion in @entity8 best of @entity69 : @entity0 celebrates with promoter @entity70 ( left ) and with his new belt ( right ) sealed with a kiss : @entity0 's girlfriend @entity73 congratulates him after his title win and when the final bell rang , the champion looked a beaten man as @entity0 and his small band of supporters celebrated			1
after @entity69 judge @entity80 scored the bout a draw , @entity0 faced a nervous wait before the other two scores were revealed			0
@entity0 becomes just the sixth @entity44 to win a world title in the welterweight division after @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			2
the 28 - year - old can now look forward to a series of money - spinning fights including a potential battle of @entity69 with bitter rival @entity14			2
eyeing up the prize : @entity0 has also talked up the possibility of stepping into the ring with @entity98 ' since i was nine years old , i 've been training to be a champion , ' said @entity0			1
' i looked scrappy , but i did what i had to do			0
' i dealt with business , it 's an unbelievable feeling , and i ca n't get my head around it			0
' you 're going to see me in some mega fights now			0
i 'm the champion ; @entity108 and @entity98 will be watching this			2
@entity14 can get in the queue			0

@entity0 won by *majority* *decision* after 12 rounds in @entity8
