the 10 - year - old , from @entity11 , @entity12 , has a prosthetic hand but due to health and safety concerns he is not allowed to wear it on the pitch and copes with just one hand			1
@entity19 - mad @entity4 , centre , was born with only one hand , pictured with his parents @entity21 and @entity23 despite his disability , @entity4 , pictured , does not allow it to stop him from playing the game he loves his dream is that when he grows up he can play with his favourite team the @entity28 , pictured @entity4 plays winger and centre for @entity31 under 11s and dreams of a career playing for his idols , the @entity28 , when he is older			1
he said : ' i have been playing rugby for nearly four years now			1
i started playing rugby because it was a good way for me to keep fit and it is a team sport so everyone can get involved			1
' the thing i love the most about it is that i have made so many new friends and get to meet lots of people			0
' my favourite team are the @entity28 and i go to watch all of their home games			1
i have met a lot of the players too and my favourite player @entity49 used to play for the same team as me			0
' i go to training camps at @entity28 every summer too and have even had the chance to play against some of my favourite players which is really exciting			2
' going to the camps and playing for @entity31 helped me decide that i definitely want to play professionally			0
my coaches have been amazing and i have improved a lot over the past few years			0
' i have two favourite positions , winger and centre			0
if i play centre then i get to tackle a lot more - sometimes it can be quite scary because there are some really tough players			0
' i do n't think having one hand holds me back from playing rugby at all , and when i start secondary school in september i am hoping to be able to play for them too one day			1
' and @entity4 is n't the only rugby fan in the family as dad @entity21 , 38 , is the reason behind the schoolboy 's obsession and @entity23 , @entity21 and daughter @entity76 , 12 , are also season ticket holders			1
@entity23 said that having one hand has never stopped @entity4 doing anything and that the brave schoolboy rarely wears his prosthetic hand except for ' cosmetic reasons '			1
doctors believe that @entity4 punched through the lining of the womb causing fibres to wrap around his arm @entity4 , pictured , has been playing for the @entity31 under 11s , where his idol @entity49 started the 39 - year - old teaching assistant said : ' @entity4 is completely obsessed with rugby - it is his life			1
' he is n't allowed to wear his prosthetic hand when he plays because of health and safety as it is quite hard and could harm another player on the pitch			1
' but he would n't want to as sometimes it just gets in his way and he copes just fine with one hand			0
he gives it his all			0
' he does very well with his rugby and is a very popular member of the team			0
. he is hoping to play for his high school as well when he starts in september			0
' they make no exceptions for him and treat him just like every other child			0
' ' when he is n't playing it , he is watching it - no matter what team it is or if it is rugby league or rugby union			2
and he has a season ticket for the @entity28			1
' according to mrs @entity118 , the only thing @entity4 can not do like his friends is tie his own shoelaces the youngster 's disability came as a huge shock to the family after what seemed to be a normal , healthy pregnancy - and his missing limb was only discovered after he was born			1
doctors think it may be a result of @entity4 punching through the lining of the womb , in the early stages of pregnancy , causing fibres to become wrapped around his right arm			2
but the missing limb did n't delay his development and he was walking unaided at just 13 - months - old and he has excelled in several sports such as football , rugby and javelin			2
mrs @entity118 said : ' if there is something @entity4 ca n't do , he quickly works out his own way of doing it			2
' he is just like any other child and he never uses his arm as an excuse			0
in fact the only thing @entity4 ca n't do is tie his own shoelaces			2
everything else , he has a good go at			0
' he has had a prosthetic arm since he was just seven - months - old but most of the time it is just a hindrance to him			2
' he had a dress arm at first and then had months of training to use a mechanical arm but he does n't wear a prosthetic often			0
' he mainly wears it for cosmetic reasons rather than functional reasons - maybe if he was having a school photo taken or something like that			0
' @entity4 , pictured , rarely wears a prosthetic arm , only using it on ' dress occasions ' like a school photo			2

@entity4 , 10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , was born with only one hand
the youngster wants to pay for the @entity28 when he grows older
