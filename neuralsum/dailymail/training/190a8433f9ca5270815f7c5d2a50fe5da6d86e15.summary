by @entity0 for @entity1 whale song , wolf howls , frog croaks and bird chirps are complex forms of communication - just like human speech , according to new research			1
these creatures may not be able to master advanced language techniques , but their unique calls are much more than just random noises , a study shows			1
the ' speech ' of seven different species of birds and mammals found they appear to be generated by processes similar to how we speak			0
monkey business : @entity24 may not be able to master advanced language techniques , but their unique calls are much more than just random noises , a study shows the mockingbird , for example , can mimic more than 100 distinct song types of different species , and the long string of wails and snorts of the from a rock hyrax - a type of badger - signify male territory			1
the study suggests there may be a ‘ missing link ’ on the path from animal communication to human language that has not yet been found			1
‘ multiple studies are finding more and more stepping stones that seem to bridge this gap , ’ said dr @entity41 , from the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			1
dr @entity41 said uncovering the process could help scientists understand the origin of human language			1
love birds : scientists conducting the study looked for evidence of @entity57 noises in the noises made by seven creatures - chickadees , finches ( pictured ) , bats , orangutans , killer whales , pilot whales , and hyraxes but while the vocalisations suggest language - like characteristics , scientists have found it difficult to figure out the complexity			2
typically , they have assumed the sequence of animal calls is generated by a simple event called a ‘ @entity57 ’ , named after a @entity75 mathematician eighty years ago , which is dependent on what happened last			1
earlier this year a @entity78 documentary called ‘ @entity79 ’ investigated how creatures , ranging from fireflies to hippos , talk to one another			0
presenter @entity84 , an @entity85 zoologist , said : ‘ ever since i was a kid i have longed to be a real life @entity88 and talk to animals			0
i think it is something we would all love to be able to do			0
’ she believes that communication is key to understanding the secret lives of animals and said that huge scientific advances have been made in cracking this animal code in recent years			2
‘ i roared , croaked , squeaked and bellowed my way across three continents to talk with creatures great and small ; from flirting with fireflies to saying hello in hippo , ’ she said			0
‘ i was blown away by how sophisticated animal speak is			0
i discovered that dolphins have names , horses know who their friends are and i even met a bird that speaks meerkat			0
‘ and then there were the chimpanzees with a language so similar to ours it gave me goose bumps to watch			0
’ animal calls are said to be restricted by rigid @entity57 rules of ‘ regular ’ grammar that have a set sequence			2
human language , in contrast , uses what are called ‘ context - free grammars ’ that apply the same set of rules in different ways , making it much less predictable			1
scientists conducting the study looked for evidence of @entity57 noises in the noises made by seven creatures - chickadees , finches , bats , orangutans , killer whales , pilot whales , and hyraxes			2
they found little evidence of @entity57 processes in animal calls			0
instead , the sounds made by animals were more like human language			2
the findings suggests there may be an intermediate step on the evolutionary path between the regular grammar of animal communication and the context - free grammar of the human form that has not yet been identified and explored			1
pictured are a family of hyraxes , a species included in the study			0

bird song and bat calls are complex forms of communication , study claims
scientists from in @entity43 , @entity44 , say the noises are not random
they say there may be a ‘ missing link ’ on the evolutionary path from animal communication to human language that has not yet been identified
*experts* *previously* assumed that animal sounds *involved* a simple *structural* *system* known as the ' @entity180 ' process
