by @entity0 published : 19:02 est , 23 march 2013 updated : 03:03 est , 25 march 2013 tories have despaired at @entity3 's conduct over @entity4 after he forged a late - night press regulation policy at @entity7 's office it was meant to be the week when the @entity1 ’ election campaign began			1
the @entity10 was designed to arm every @entity1 mp with a message for the doorstep			1
but instead this became the week where @entity3 landed himself with a problem that will bedevil him all the way to polling day			1
the problem is a system of press regulation that has alarmed nearly every newspaper in the land and infuriated several @entity24			1
compounding this problem is that this was n’t a deal made in @entity28 , but in @entity7 ’s office			1
one despairing cabinet minister says when he woke up and heard what had happened , he put his pillow over his head and considered resigning			1
it is little wonder then that @entity35 , the man @entity3 hired to deliver a @entity1 victory at the next election , is so concerned by events			1
a friend remarks ruefully : ‘ @entity35 told them to sort minimum alcohol pricing and @entity4 as they were both distractions from the main message			1
but this certainly is n’t what he had in mind on @entity4			1
’ this was a u-turn with added political incompetence – for ten days previously , @entity3 had called off cross-party talks saying the distance between the parties was unbridgeable			1
even one of his longest - standing allies admits the deal was ‘ terrible and ridiculous ’			1
one no 10 aide defends the agreement but concedes : ‘ no one was thinking through how it looks			1
’ @entity61 's negotiators are incredulous at how the @entity1 handled things – allowing @entity63 to be summoned from his bed to late - night talks and to arrive without any political support			1
one says : ‘ we could n’t believe they had n’t created a better , stronger team			1
they were so apolitical about it			1
’ the fact the mild - mannered , consensual @entity63 was doing this job at all reveals how politically naive @entity73 can be			1
one secretary of state points out that ‘ when you ’re in a knife fight with @entity7 on the issue he ’s used to define himself , it is risky to send in a healer not a warrior ’			2
mild - mannered , consensual policy minister @entity63 was called from his bed to the talks on press regulation this week ’s events have led to a growing feeling in @entity1 circles that @entity35 , the man who led @entity87 to victory twice in @entity89 , needs to go full - time			1
if he does n’t , political mistakes will keep on happening – making his job and a general election victory impossible			2
one minister who knows the @entity3 operation well insists that @entity35 ‘ wo n’t be able to do what he needs to do unless he ’s around every day ’			1
@entity35 is already proving hugely influential			2
one @entity100 ally tells me ‘ to say that this was @entity103 as much as @entity104 is an exaggeration			2
but there ’s some truth to it			2
’ so far , he has fitted into the team better than expected			2
many thought the straight - talking @entity111 ’s style would n’t suit the more genteel @entity3 circle			1
but even @entity113 , @entity3 ’s chief strategist , who was expected to clash spectacularly with @entity35 , is getting on with him			1
the unpolitical nature of @entity73 has long been a source of irritation to @entity1 cabinet ministers			2
at a political cabinet meeting last year , several ministers complained forcefully to @entity3 about it			1
there are signs that their message is starting to get through			2
@entity124 , the recently appointed deputy chief of staff , is proving adept at pushing @entity1 changes through the @entity127 machine			2
and @entity128 , who has been with @entity3 since he became leader , has now been put in charge of the government ’s daily agenda , bringing a sense of energy and discipline to it			1
acknowledging that there ’s a problem , @entity3 has taken to telling people he wants the government ’s message to be ‘ cleaner and clearer ’			1
but if the @entity1 are to be in with a fighting chance at the @entity144 , they ’ll need to realise they ’re in a political battle now			2
the @entity10 showed that when they remember that , they are competitive			2
but last week revealed what disasters happen when they fail to grasp this			2
@entity152 is in the middle of the longest bank holiday in history and , when banks do reopen , there will be strict limits on how much money people can take out			0
but the @entity160 believes the island is n’t going to end up being the first to quit the single currency			0
one senior figure says : ‘ @entity164 is playing hardball but she does n’t want the economic danger of @entity152 leaving the euro			0
’ but one minister concedes that the situation is moving so fast it is hard to know what will happen next , especially given that @entity172 was reluctant to see @entity152 even join the @entity173 in 2004			1
if the @entity152 do leave , it ’ll be the cheapest place in @entity176 to holiday this summer			0
@entity3 will head north of the border in the coming weeks as the government continues to plot how to beat @entity179 in the 2014 scottish independence referendum			1
@entity179 , for his part , is missing no opportunity to get under the skin of cabinet ministers , by signing off letters to them : ‘ yours for an independent @entity188			0
’ but @entity189 , the no - nonsense transport secretary , has come up with a simple response			0
he finishes his own correspondence to @entity179 : ‘ yours for a @entity192			0
’ former @entity194 producer @entity193 is said to be behind the @entity104 's slick presentation and improving @entity100 's media performances the night before the @entity10 , @entity100 and his treasury team sat eating takeaway @entity199 ’s pizza as they went through the details one last time			0
there was a certain nervousness			0
they knew @entity100 could n’t afford for this budget to unravel as the last one had			0
today , it is clear it has n’t			0
much of the damage done to the chancellor ’s reputation on the @entity1 backbenches by last year ’s events has been repaired			0
@entity100 ’s political capital and confidence are also returning			0
as one @entity217 ally proclaims : ‘ we ’ve got the full @entity100 back			0
’ @entity100 has done much to try to avoid a repeat of last year ’s problems			0
he ’s strengthened his ministerial team , bringing in @entity221 , one of the cleverest @entity1 in @entity223 , and @entity224 , a former banker and one of the stars of the new @entity1 intake			0
he ’s also bolstered his office with two new advisers			0
@entity230 , former head of think - tank @entity231 , is responsible for the chancellor ’s refrain that the government is for ‘ people who work hard and want to get on ’			0
the other arrival is former @entity194 producer @entity193 , left , who worked with the @entity239 ’s political editor @entity238			0
insiders credit her with the slick presentation of the @entity10 and improving @entity100 ’s media performances			0
but the real challenge for @entity100 and his team will come with the spending review in june , which must set out a further £ 11.5 billion of cuts			0
it is hard to see how the numbers can be made to add up , given there will be no further savings from welfare , and the @entity252 are determined to protect the budget of @entity255 ’s @entity254 , which they believe to be key to growth			0
this means the only option appears to be big cuts in the @entity1 - run @entity261 and @entity263			0
this wo n’t go down well with their ministers , who have already spoken out against more cuts			0
one @entity269 source concedes the spending review will ‘ get noisy ’ but is adamant they ‘ will get it done ’			0
if @entity100 can manage to square this circle , his political authority really will be restored .			0
