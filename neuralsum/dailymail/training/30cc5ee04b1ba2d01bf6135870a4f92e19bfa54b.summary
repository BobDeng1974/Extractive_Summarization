by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 06:12 est , 29 october 2013 it would be designed to look like an eight - mile piece of parkland or an art installation at the water 's edge			0
but it would serve a much more important purpose than brightening up lower @entity9			0
this is one of more than 40 designs aimed at protecting the @entity13 and @entity14 coastlines from a repeat of the catastrophic flooding that hit the area during @entity18 a year ago			1
the design , submitted by @entity21 architectural firm @entity20 and known as the ' @entity22 ' , proposes a system of levees and berms that would protect lower @entity9			1
the ' @entity22 ' , an mile system of berms and levees disguised as art installations and parkland , was one of more than 40 designs entered into a competition aimed at avoiding a repeat of last year 's devastating flooding during @entity18 a plan by @entity36 , a landscape architecture studio , of flood protections at the edge of @entity14 's @entity39 the designs are proposed to avoid a repeat of the devastating flooding that hit parts of @entity13 and @entity14 during @entity18 last year but the system would be disguised behind murals and plant life , making it look more attractive than your standard flood defence			1
the plans were exhibited at @entity51 as part of a federally funded design competition aimed at protecting the area from future flooding			1
the 41 ideas range from the simple to the imaginative , with some proposing to drastically re-alter the appearance of the coast			2
another design group suggested systems of artificial reefs , restored marshland and tidal flats that would take the punch out of surf hitting exposed coast and prevent big floods from pushing deep into bays and tidal estuaries			0
some of the other designs take into account the potential for sea levels to rise as a result of the planet 's melting ice caps			2
a group of designers called the @entity79 submitted a plan looking ahead to the year 2080 on the @entity81			2
this design shows a plan by @entity84 of flood protections in @entity86 , including a restored tidal marsh much of the area surrounding @entity13 was left underwater following the devastating superstorm a year ago it suggested that , by then , people would get to what remained of @entity93 by water taxi , rather than road , and visit amusement parks that would sit on barges , rather than piers			1
it is hoped that the most impressive designs that come out of the rebuild by design competition will become a reality and some could be implemented using @entity105 disaster recovery funds			2
but the ultimate goal is to have flooding defences designed that could inspire similar projects elsewhere			0
other ideas included a system of channels that would help divert flood water surging up from @entity114 's bays and a huge water collection basin that could absorb floodwaters on @entity9 's low - lying @entity117			0
this picture shows the entrance to the @entity121 underwater in october last year cars floating in a flooded subterranian basement following @entity124 in the @entity125 of @entity13 in the coming weeks the ideas will be whittled down to just 10 by @entity128 housing and urban development secretary @entity127 , who led president @entity130 's @entity129			1
@entity131 , co-chairman of the jury that will be helping @entity127 make the selections , told an audience of planners , architects and engineers the goal is to turn the broad concepts unveiled monday into practical projects that could get federal funding			1
working with the @entity143 , the design teams spent several months doing research and touring storm - damaged areas while they prepared their projects			0
more than 140 teams originally entered the competition , but that number was previously whittled down to the current group of finalists			0
the devastating flooding , seen here in @entity155 in @entity13 , cost the @entity128 some $ 65billion in repair costs @entity143 president @entity157 said in a statement that the competition is part of an effort to ' revolutionise ' how coastal communities are planned			1
she said : ' we 're eager to see which ideas move into the design phase , and hope that they all inspire new ways of thinking around planning and development			0
' superstorm @entity18 left swathes of @entity13 and @entity14 devastated by flooding when it struck in october 2012			1
at least 182 people were killed and $ 65billion of damage was caused across the @entity128			0
it was the second costliest weather disaster in @entity128 history behind only @entity177 , according to the @entity178 .			0

@entity21 architects submitted one of 41 designs to protect @entity13 and @entity14
the designs are part of a federal funded contest in the wake of @entity18
