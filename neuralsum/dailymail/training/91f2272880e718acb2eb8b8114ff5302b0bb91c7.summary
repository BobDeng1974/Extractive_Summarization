6 @entity30 : got away scott - free when he tripped @entity12 inside the penalty area			1
6 @entity2 's @entity24 lunges to challenge @entity0 's @entity28 at @entity4 's @entity33 : moved into midfield at start of second half , speculative effort wide of @entity39 ’s post			1
6.5 @entity40 : @entity2 rely heavily on their two full backs to bomb on , but @entity0 strangle teams			1
6 @entity43 : an influential and key member of this @entity2 team , full of running and bursts forward			0
7 @entity47 : booked for an early challenge			2
@entity2 missed @entity50 in the centre of midfield , they could have done with him here			0

replaced by @entity56 at half - time			2
5 @entity58 : desperate to create an impression against the champions , provided the odd moment of inspiration			0
6 @entity63 : caught in a sandwich between @entity65 and @entity66 , found it difficult to create space			1
strength and power is not the way to beat these two			0
6 @entity72 : outstanding down the left , he was the biggest threat for @entity2 in the first half			0
6 @entity54 was n't his self for @entity2 and was replaced , likely injured , at half - time substitutes @entity56 ( @entity54 46 ) came on at half time to play alongside @entity30 , never got close to stopping either @entity0 goal			1

far more composed and assured than his central defensive partner @entity66			2
without him they can not compete for title			0
taken off injured a minute from time , which is a worry			2
8 @entity65 is @entity14 's star man for his composure at the back for @entity0 but worryingly limped off @entity66 : there should be an investigation by the @entity123 into how this guy cost £ 32m			1
unforgivable to pay this amount			0
it seems impossible on the evidence so far			0
1 @entity11 : couple of hoofed clearances in the second half under pressure ; he ’ s better than that			2

7 @entity141 : rugged , hardworking performance in the centre			2

scored a beaut to seal it			0
7 @entity181 ( @entity182 75 ) : brought on to steady the ship			0
@entity185 he should have been on from the start			0
6 @entity9 laces his shot for @entity0 's second goal after coming off the bench in place of @entity28 subs not used : @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 manager - @entity196 : calm and unflustered on the touchline , the champions did a number on @entity2 here			1
