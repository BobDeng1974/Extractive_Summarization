the chain of events which sparked an auction for @entity3 can be traced back to a conference call two weeks before @entity5			1
@entity6 , a former non-executive director of @entity3 , took his leave of @entity8 on a wednesday morning			1
his departure not only removed the first point of contact for @entity12 , the @entity13 who has upped his bid for the club to £ 20million plus £ 6.5m in short - term loans			1
it also ended the uneasy alliance safeguarding @entity21 ’s powerbase			1
an undemonstrative financier , @entity6 was never , as people had speculated , the appointed representative of @entity25 on the plc board			1
( l - r ) @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 ( back row ) , @entity31 and @entity32 @entity33 , chairman of @entity34 , put his name forward to the club ’s former nominated advisers @entity38			2
but the final approval for his appointment was granted by chairman @entity28 , @entity27 and former finance director @entity41			0
a quietly spoken @entity42 with a strong ethical streak and extensive experience of publicly quoted companies , @entity6 took his boardroom responsibilities at @entity3 seriously			1
guarding the interests of @entity34 was never his goal			0
protecting the wider body of shareholders was			0
while others , including the @entity32 brothers and @entity53 , threw their weight behind @entity56 owner @entity21 ’s takeover by stealth , @entity6 remained a sceptic			1
he stood back from the crowd and applied a critical eye			0
@entity6 's departure ended uneasy alliance safeguarding @entity21 ’s powerbase he began to ask questions			1
few were of the type his fellow directors cared to answer			2
in the weeks before his departure , @entity6 sent a steady stream of emails querying the club ’s running to @entity28			1
his queries were wide - ranging and complex			2
one was shared by many supporters			0
why was @entity21 obtaining so much power and influence			1
he had provided £ 3m of short - term loans			2
but the offer of £ 16m for a 51 per cent stake from @entity83 and @entity84 appeared to be better for shareholders			0
the issue was one of timing			0
the @entity21 cash was available more quickly than the @entity83 cash and the board had failed to receive proof of funds from the @entity95 - based former director			1
apparently ignoring the club ’s broader interests , @entity21 pushed on at some pace			1
he pursued @entity100 dispensation to up his stake in the club to 29.9 per cent			0
dual interest regulations would frustrate him in the end			0
yet , two weeks before the club ’s annual general meeting or the @entity100 edict , he was acting as if the deed was done			0
@entity109 were effectively calling the shots			0
this struck some investors , most notably @entity34 , as unsatisfactory			0
@entity21 , after all , had just 8.92 per cent of the shares			1
he was a significant shareholder but by no means a majority one			0
@entity21 called the shots despite owning just 8.92 per cent of the shares in @entity3 with @entity3 running out of money , however , a wealthy benefactor was needed			1
he was also prepared to work with the existing directors , @entity28 and the @entity121 , so long as they supported his goals			2
to the outside world , @entity21 ’s goal appeared to be to protect the lucrative @entity3 merchandising contracts which poured millions into the coffers of @entity109			1
his trusted lieutenants @entity31 and @entity29 were brought in and became influential			0
so much so that , weeks before his appointment as chief executive was confirmed to the stock market , @entity31 was the man who instigated the dismissal of @entity6 during a conference call which became heated following more awkward , unwanted questions			1
to an outsider , @entity6 ’s questions would have seemed logical — necessary even			1
they were concerns any shareholder or non-executive director with the broader interests of the club might ask			0
but the broader interests of @entity3 were no longer what was at stake two weeks before @entity5			1
what mattered by then were the interests of @entity21 and @entity109			1
so it was , then , that @entity6 was informed down a telephone line that his fellow directors no longer wished to work with him			1
@entity3 manager @entity150 quickly followed @entity6 out of @entity8 sources say he had become a persistent , troublesome thorn in the side of @entity21 ’s unquestioning acolytes			1
they could have waited until the @entity155 two weeks later , when @entity6 was up for re-election anyway , and allowed shareholders to decide			2
but tension was growing and , as the subsequent emails have revealed , some on the @entity3 board would do whatever it took to keep hold of their blazers and ties			2
@entity6 ’s exit , when it was confirmed , was low - key			1
within 48 hours @entity150 , an @entity8 icon , had resigned			0
the departure of a non-executive director threatened to become a footnote			2
yet what happened that day proved to be critical			0
it was @entity175 for the @entity8 status quo			0
by bulleting @entity6 , the @entity3 directors created a substantial problem for themselves			1
in time , it may even prove to be their downfall			2
@entity25 , chaired by @entity181 , had been broadly supportive of the @entity21 and @entity183 powerbase during key votes			1
but the @entity186 hedge fund were becoming concerned by the direction the club was moving in			0
@entity21 ’s interests , they believed , no longer aligned with theirs or those of @entity3 as a club			1
@entity6 ’s removal was the final straw			2
it convinced @entity181 to sell the firm ’s 14.5 per cent stake in the club			0
they were sold to the ‘ @entity200 ’ of @entity84 , @entity201 and @entity202 with a final withering salvo			0
in a statement , @entity204 blamed @entity28 for the departure of @entity6 and described the chairman — a much - derided figure these days — as a ‘ wet fish ’			1
@entity12 , the soccer - loving owner of the @entity211 basketball team @entity34 were appalled by a staggering request from @entity28 for a rise in his £ 60,000 - a - year non-executive chairman ’s salary			2
this at a time when the club were running out of cash			0
yet @entity34 ’s shares might easily have gone elsewhere — to the man whose belated bid to purchase the club has just been rejected			0
whilst still on the board , @entity6 had received an approach from @entity12 , the soccer - loving owner of the @entity211 basketball team			1
@entity228 to acquire control of a football club in the @entity231 , the @entity13 banker was persuaded by former @entity8 defender @entity232 — a fellow resident of @entity233 — to consider saving @entity3			2
through mutual friends , he was put in touch with @entity6			2
opting to make an £ 18m offer for new shares — raised to £ 20m plus a £ 6.5m short - term loan — @entity12 took a different path			0
the @entity34 shares went instead to @entity201 , @entity84 and @entity202			0
and within days @entity83 — acting separately , but with a common interest — would also purchase a near 15 per cent stake in the club			0
previously untouchable , @entity21 had been blindsided			2
soon @entity29 was appointed finance director			0
it is presumed it was done on the say - so of his sports direct boss , but that has never been confirmed			0
either way , the best strategy for @entity21 now may be to work with the potential new investors rather than against them			1
if — or , rather , when — regime change happens , the chances of @entity28 or the @entity121 retaining their cherished positions on the @entity3 board diminish greatly			2
another reason why they , as power slips from their fingers , must wish a conference call in mid-december had taken a different course .			0

@entity6 was a thorn in the side of potential buyer @entity21
his low - key departure may prove the downfall of the @entity3 directors
