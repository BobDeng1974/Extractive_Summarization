@entity0 use fewer negative words on @entity2 and are more likely to talk about their social relationships than self - professed atheists such as @entity5 @entity0 use more positive words and engage in less analytical tweeting than atheists , according to new university research			1
computer analysis of nearly two million tweets has found that @entity0 use fewer negative words and are more likely to talk about their social relationships than atheists on @entity2			1
the research was carried out by @entity17 graduate student @entity16 , alongside fellow graduate student @entity18 and psychology professor @entity19			0
the findings are reported in the journal of @entity22			0
to identify @entity0 and atheist @entity2 users , the researchers studied the tweets of more than 16,000 followers of a few prominent @entity0 and atheist personalities on @entity2			2
they analysed the tweets for their emotional content , such as the use of positive and negative words as well as the frequency of words such as ' friend ' and ' brother ' that are related to social situations			2
they also looked at the use of words such as ' because ' and ' think ' that are associated with an analytical thinking style			1
the research found that overall , tweets by @entity0 had more positive and less negative content than tweets by atheists			2
@entity0 used less analytical and more social words , which were correlated with the use of words indicating positive emotions , the researchers said			1
' if religious people are indeed happier than nonreligious people , differences in social support and thinking style may help to explain why , ' said @entity17 graduate student @entity16			1
he believes that the findings are in line with other studies linking greater levels of social connectedness to higher well - being			0
professor @entity19 said : ' religious communities are very social			0
just being a member of a religious group connects people to others , and it may be this social connection that can make people happier			1
' on the other hand , atheists had a more analytical thinking style in their tweets than @entity0 , which at extremes can make people less happy			1
' previous research has found a positive association between religion and well - being among @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity0 and @entity82			0
@entity0 use less analytical and more social words , which correlate with the use of words indicating positive emotions , according to the researchers			1
they believe that their work might help to explain why religious people might be happier than atheists however , most of the studies has relied on individuals to tell researchers about how satisfied they are with their lives or their emotional state at a given time			1
professor @entity19 said : " what 's great about @entity2 is that people are reporting their experiences – good or bad – as they occur			0
' ' as researchers , we do not need to ask them how they feel because they are already telling us			0
' while the authors have drawn their conclusions that @entity0 appear to be happier than atheists on @entity2 , they are careful to say that their results are based on observing correlations			2
professor @entity19 said : ' this does not mean atheists are unhappy overall or doomed to be miserable			0
' ' if religion improves happiness indirectly through other factors , those benefits could also be found outside religious groups			0
' the research was partially funded by the @entity117 , which aids research relating to the ' big questions of human purpose and ultimate reality ' .			0
