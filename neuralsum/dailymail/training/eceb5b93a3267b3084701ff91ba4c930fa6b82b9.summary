this picture is posed by an actor torture permanently damages a human 's normal perception of discomfort , scientists have warned			2
ex-prisoners of war ( pows ) , continue to suffer from ' dysfunctional pain perception and regulation ' , likely as a result of their torture , according to @entity19 researchers			1
they found the ex-soldiers ' bodies do not recover from immediate pain as quickly as people who have not been tortured and that they also feel pain more acutely if it is reoccurring			2
a team of scientists studied the long - term effects of torture on the human pain system by looking at a group of @entity19 soldiers 40 years after they were captured			1
the soldiers who took part in the study were seized during the 1973 @entity34 and were subjected to brutal torture in @entity36 and @entity37			1
held alone in tiny , filthy spaces for weeks or months , sometimes handcuffed and blindfolded , they suffered severe beatings , burns , electric shocks and starvation , and rather than receiving treatment , additional torture was inflicted on existing wounds			0
now research by professor @entity47 of the @entity48 in the @entity49 at @entity50 , shows that ex pows continue to suffer from dysfunctional pain perception and regulation , probably as a result of their bad treatment decades ago			1
the study , which was conducted in collaboration with professor @entity58 and professor @entity59 of the university 's @entity60 of @entity62 and professor @entity63 of the @entity64 at the @entity65 , @entity66 , was published in the @entity67			0
' the human body 's pain system can either inhibit or excite pain			0
it 's two sides of the same coin , said professor @entity47			0
' usually , when it does more of one , it does less of the other , but in @entity19 ex @entity51 , torture appears to have caused dysfunction in both directions			0
our findings emphasise that tissue damage can have long - term systemic effects and needs to be treated immediately			0
' a team of scientists studied the long - term effects of torture on the human pain system by looking at a group of @entity19 soldiers 40 years after they were captured and tortured			1
a machine that was used to administer electric shocks in previous , unrelated studies is pictured the study focused on 104 combat veterans of the @entity34 , 60 of whom were taken prisoner during the war , and 44 of whom were not			1
all participants of the study were put through a battery of psychophysical pain tests , which included applying a heating device to one arm , submerging the other arm in a hot water bath and pressing a nylon fibre into a middle finger , and then filled out psychological questionnaires			2
the researchers believe non-physical torture - such as solitary confinement , illustrated - may have also contributed to the ex @entity51 ' chronic pain the ex @entity51 exhibited diminished pain inhibition - the degree to which the body eases one pain in response to another - and heightened pain excitation , which is the degree to which repeated exposure to the same sensation heightens the resulting pain			1
based on these findings , the researchers concluded that the torture survivors ' bodies now regulate pain in a dysfunctional way			1
it is not entirely clear whether the dysfunction is the result of years of chronic pain or of the original torture itself , but the ex @entity51 exhibited worse pain regulation than the non @entity51 chronic pain sufferers in the study			1
a statistical analysis of the test data also suggested that being tortured had a direct effect on their ability to regulate pain			2
the researchers believe non-physical torture may have also contributed to the ex @entity51 ' chronic pain			2
among other forms of oppression and humiliation , the ex @entity51 were not allowed to use the toilet , were cursed at and threatened , told demoralising misinformation about their loved ones and were exposed to mock executions			0
in the later stages of captivity , most of the @entity51 were transferred to a group cell , where social isolation was replaced by intense friction , crowding and loss of privacy			0
' we think psychological torture also affects the physiological pain system , ' says professor @entity47			0
' we still have to fully analyse the data , but preliminary analysis suggests there is a connection , ' she added .			0

@entity50 researchers found ex-prisoners of war continued to suffer from dysfunctional pain perception 40 years after being tortured
the study focused on 104 combat veterans of the @entity34 , 60 of whom were taken prisoner and tortured and 44 of whom were not
the scientists found the men exhibited diminished pain inhibition and heightened pain excitation , probably from *emotional* and physical torture
