the cost of the @entity20 in the @entity21 has now been reduced to $ 49.99 from $ 99 with a two - year contract , @entity6 spokesman @entity18 said on sunday			1
after being the main player in the mobile market for the best part of a decade , @entity6 has failed to produce a smartphone to compete with those from rivals such as @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
the company was criticised for being late to embrace smartphones and has been lagging behind ever since			0
it has also been losing market share in less expensive mobile phones			2
so its alliance with @entity39 - the phones run @entity41 software - was meant to rejuvenate the company			0
but it has failed to capture the public imagination so far			0
@entity6 's phone is sold at @entity47 @entity46 said the price cut ' is part of our ongoing lifecycle management , which is jointly done between @entity6 and carrier customers '			1
featuring a 4.3 - inch screen , 1.4 - gigahertz processor and 8 - megapixel camera , the @entity20 uses largely untried software from @entity39 sales have been slow , and @entity6 took a further hit when @entity39 said current phones will be unable to run its new @entity61 software , rendering them obsolete			1
last month , @entity6 said it would cut 10,000 jobs , and that its handset business would post a larger - than - expected quarterly loss			1
all three major credit rating agencies have downgraded @entity6 to ' junk ' status			1
triumphant return ? @entity6 's alliance with @entity39 - its new smartphones run @entity41 software - was meant to rejuvenate the company , but has failed to capture the public imagination so far smartphones using @entity79 's @entity78 system are expected to comprise 61 per cent of the global market in 2012 , while @entity29 's @entity13 could capture more than 20 per cent , @entity75 said last month			1
@entity6 is expected to report second - quarter results on july 19			1
shares of @entity6 closed on friday at 1.51 euros , after earlier in the week falling to their lowest since the mid- 1990s			2

@entity6 's @entity89 smartphone runs @entity41 slick @entity91 operating system , and offers a luxurious - feeling black touchscreen , built - in office compatibility and @entity95 games the @entity97 handset ( pictured ) is priced just £ 234 , but offers much of the same smartphone functions as the pricier 800 @entity6 's @entity100 's are an alliance between @entity6 and @entity39 - the touchscreen phone runs @entity39 's simple , good - looking windows phone 7 software			2
both companies are relying on @entity100 to catapult them back into competition with rivals @entity13 and @entity78			2
so far , @entity39 's @entity41 software has failed to make an impact , and @entity6 's market share has been steadily dwindling			2
when current ceo @entity111 took over the company , he likened @entity6 's situation to a man standing on a ' burning oil platform ' - with the choices of staying and burning alive or leaping into the sea			0
@entity100 is the ' leap into the sea ' - an alliance with @entity39 to propel @entity6 's handsets back into the limelight			0
@entity100 is cheaper than @entity13 , and simpler than @entity78			0
it also works with @entity124 documents , and has @entity95 games built in			0
the design is pure high - end @entity6 smartphone , with a moulded polycarbonate exterior and a @entity130 lens that has already drawn admiring reviews from tech blogs			0
the @entity1 mobile maker said the cuts were part of plans to ‘ significantly reduce its operating expenses ’ as it aims to return to profitable growth by sharpening strategy and improving its operating model			0
the company warned that second - quarter loss from its phone business would be larger than expected			0
@entity6 said it remains focused on its smartphones and feature phones and intends to expand location - based services			2
