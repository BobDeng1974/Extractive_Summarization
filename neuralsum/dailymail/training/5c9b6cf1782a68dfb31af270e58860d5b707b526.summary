sitting alone in her room on the 14th floor of a @entity4 hospital , @entity0 needed some cheering up			1
a week earlier the 48 - year - old was shocked to learn what she thought was the stomach flu was actually @entity10 leukemia - blood cancer			1
she was subsequently rushed into chemotherapy and has been sick in hospital since			1
so when her 14 - year - old son , @entity14 , called the phone in her room at the weekend , it was a case of great timing			1
although her life has since been turned upside down , the love of her family is getting her through it ' he said come come to the window , he was so excited , ' @entity0 told @entity41			2
' i pulled up the window and it said ' hi mom ' with a smiley face and all			0
' @entity47 and his father , @entity48 , were on their way inside @entity51 at the time when they drove to the roof to see the view of @entity4 's skyline			1
what they found was an opportunity in the freshly - fallen snow			0
' i just kind of thought , ' you know , it would be great to have my mom see this message. , ' @entity14 told @entity65			1
' and so i started from there , and my dad was like , ' what are you doing ? ' and he joined in			0
i said , ' i 'm saying hi to mom , ' and we went on from there			0
' @entity74 , @entity14 's older sister , said she ca n't believe how much attention the message - which went viral almost immediately - has received @entity25 has always been incredibly close with his mother , @entity77 , who is now battling blood cancer however , when the two left the hospital around 10pm that night , they could the faces of many patients looking down at them , and decided the gesture was n't big enough			1
' @entity84 had the idea to write @entity86 , ' said @entity74 , @entity47 's older sister			0
' but it could n't fit , so it says @entity89 , but it 's still something everybody could see			0
' it was a message that touched the hospital from top to bottom - literally			2
' one of the other family members here said they had had goose bumps and that night went to bed crying about how special that was , ' hospital nurse @entity94 said			0
all gone : sadly the carpark had to be plowed on monday morning to make more space for parking , however apparently the plowers were reluctant to sweep away the message ' it shows she raised an incredible young man and there is so much love in that family			0
' sadly the message was plowed away on monday morning , with the hospital needed the rooftop for parking , however the image , which was tweeted by a hospital staffer , had already gone viral			2
@entity0 has since become known as ' the @entity118 ' at @entity119 .			2

@entity4 mom @entity0 , 48 , was *diagnosed* with cancer last week and was rushed into chemotherapy
her son @entity14 , 14 , decided to write her a message in the thick snow on the car park roof across the hospital
not only was the message *noticed* by all the patients inside the hospital , but has touched many more after going viral this week
