by @entity0 a five - year - old boy was banned from his school canteen and allegedly given bread and water for lunch after the school refused to accept a ' late ' dinner money payment from his mother			1
@entity9 , a pupil at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , usually goes to the school canteen each day for a tuna and cheese wrap , as well as a pick and mix salad from the salad bar			1
but the young pupil was made to eat an alternative lunch outside his headteacher 's office after his mother @entity8 tried to pay his £ 9 dinner money five hours ' too late '			1
@entity9 , five , was made to sit outisde his headteacher 's office and was given bread and water for lunch after his mother @entity8 handed in the £ 9 payment for the forthcoming week 's meals ' too late ' the school asks parents to pay money for the forthcoming week 's meals by the friday before			1
but when ms @entity33 tried to pay the amount at the end of the day , instead of in the morning , the school refused to accept it			1
despite assurances from the school that his mother 's ' missed ' payment would not leave her boy without the usual school dinner , @entity9 was stopped from eating in the school canteen the following week			1
@entity9 ’s grandmother @entity43 said the family was now considering moving @entity9 to another school after she claims he was given a bread roll and water for his lunch			2
in a statement , a spokesman for the school denied the claims and said @entity9 had been given the same lunch as everyone else that day - which included a tuna baguette , juice and ice cream and fruit for dessert			1
but the 68 - year - old from @entity61 , @entity12 , said : ' they gave him a brown barmcake and a glass of water			2
@entity9 was so upset and he was saying ‘ what have i done ? ’ @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , said the move was to stop children being embarrassed at not having their usual lunch and have now apologised for the incident ' when we took him to school the next day he kept saying ‘ have i got to sit outside the headteacher ’s room ? ’ ' he ’s only five so he ’s not old enough to understand			1
he did n’t understand why he could n’t sit with his best friend like he normally does			0
' mrs @entity33 said parents had not been told there was a time deadline for the payment and the only specification was that it was paid on friday			0
the school confirmed there had been a ' misunderstanding ' in regards to the payment			2
mrs @entity33 said her daughter was also reassured that @entity9 would still be given his lunch and would not be left on his own			0
on the monday , because his account was ' in credit ' from a previously missed lunch , @entity9 was allowed to chose his lunch from the canteen			2
' he ’s only five so he ’s not old enough to understand			0
he did n’t understand why he could n’t sit with his best friend like he normally does ' @entity33 , @entity9 's grandmother but the following day , mrs @entity33 said she discovered @entity9 had spent lunchtime on his own outside headteacher @entity91 ’s room			1
@entity9 was then given packed lunches all week until his mother could pay the next lunch money instalment the following friday			1
mrs @entity33 said : ' it says in the school newsletter that the children ’s dinner money has to be paid on a friday but it does n’t say what time			0
' my daughter had n’t forgotten all year but last friday she forgot to take it in with her in the morning			0
' when she went to pick him up at 3.30pm she went to the office but the headteacher said ‘ you ’re too late ’			2
she said ‘ it ’s still friday ’ but she said it had to be in by lunchtime			0
' they just would n’t take the money off us			0
he was being punished for something he has n’t done and we want to make sure it does n’t happen to anyone else			0
' the school said the move was to prevent children from being embarrassed in front of other pupils if they did not have their usual lunch			0
the statement said : ' pupils whose parents have forgotten to pay for school dinner are given a more basic packed lunch made up of a sandwich , a drink and a piece of fruit			2
' to avoid embarrassment , pupils in this situation have their lunch away from other children			0
however , in this specific instance , due to a misunderstanding by a supply teacher , the child had the same lunch as every other pupil that day - a baguette , drink and a dessert			0
' we have apologised to the parent and the child for any upset and confusion caused and taken steps to make sure the system for payment is communicated consistently in future			1
