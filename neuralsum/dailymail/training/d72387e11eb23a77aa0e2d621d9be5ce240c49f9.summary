the internet is alight today with stories of faith , confections , and one very famous egg roll , but the biggest web destination of them all has opted to honor a leftist labor activist instead of the @entity9 holiday			1
several times per year , and sometimes per month , internet search behemoth @entity10 shakes things up on its incredibly high - traffic homepage by changing its logo to celebrate a memorable day in history like a famous person ’s birthday or world - changing event			1
this past february 6 , for instance , the company honored what would have been famed anthropologist @entity24 ’s 100th birthday			0
earlier in the year , @entity10 gave nods to the birthdays of baseball legend @entity27 , dr. @entity28 , and , true to the company ’s quirky form , pioneering ice resurfacer @entity31			2
daring doodle : some @entity34 are angry @entity10 honored labor activist @entity35 in @entity37 's @entity36 instead of their holiday the ‘ @entity51 ’ began as a way for @entity10 founders @entity40 and @entity41 to leave a sort of ‘ @entity50 ’ message when they placed a stick figure within their logo before taking off for @entity49 ’s @entity48 festival in 1998			1
since then , the @entity36 has grown in frequency and popularity and become a fun way to learn about history , world - changing events like the fall of the @entity55 , and about famous scientific innovations like the @entity57			0
as with dr. @entity61 , @entity10 has remained dedicated over the years to celebrating important social figures in their doodles			2
today , that tradition continued			0
biased ? some believe @entity10 is disrespecting @entity34 by not recognizing the @entity9 holiday while honoring a celebrated labor leader @entity69 figures : @entity10 tends to honor ground - breaking figures and scientific milestones on its altered homepage in celebration of labor activist and @entity75 co-founder @entity35 , @entity10 changed one of the @entity77 in its logo to a portrait of the legendary organizer			1
the decision to honor @entity35 on this particular day has some perplexed and others angry			0
it may be @entity35 ’s birthday , but it also happens to be @entity37			0
@entity86 personality @entity84 took to his webpage to air his grievances			0
‘ christians across the nation are outraged after @entity10 decided to honor labor leader @entity35 ’s birthday instead of @entity92 on @entity37 , ’ @entity84 wrote			2
alongside his complaints , @entity93 posted an excerpt of the declaration from president @entity98 designation of march 31 as @entity99			1
@entity84 also posted comments sent in by his readers , many of them urging a @entity34 boycott of @entity10			1
‘ @entity10 , hello @entity108 , ’ wrote one @entity93 reader , referencing @entity107 ’s competing search engine			1
inclusive : @entity10 has never mentioned @entity110 in its doodles , preferring more general ' @entity112 ' well - wishing like @entity93 ’ page , former television personality @entity116 ’s outlet @entity113 also suggests that @entity34 are furious with @entity10			1
as evidence , both @entity113 and @entity84 link to a list of angry tweets on the issue compiled at website @entity122			0
in 2013 , the @entity34 celebration of the resurrection of @entity92 happens to coincide with what @entity98 declared @entity99 back in 2011			1
instead of honoring the over 2000 - year - old @entity34 holiday , the @entity129 titan threw its weight behind a leftist activist			1
some may view this as evidence that @entity136 liberalism allows political values to trump religious ones			0
however , taking a look back at @entity140 from the past 15 or so years reveals some patterns that might get @entity10 ’s head off the naughty lists of the faithful			2
for starters , @entity9 changes dates every year and @entity99 does not			1
the two coincided this year and will do so again in future years			0
the next will be 2024 , followed by 2086 , and again in 2097 and in 2176			0
for the folks upset with @entity10 today who are still around in 2024 and hoping for an @entity150 , be aware of another fact : @entity10 has n’t had an @entity150 since 2000			2
they never had one before and they have not had one since			0
in fact , the company that many would argue is largely apolitical seems also to be largely areligious			0
at least if its doodles are any indication			0
secular celebrations @entity161 , @entity162 , and @entity163 are doodle mainstays , but come @entity110 time the holiday shoutouts on the @entity10 homepage became decidedly more generic			1
back in 1998 , @entity10 only had three doodles and none of them celebrated @entity110			1
there was a @entity171 , a introduction of @entity173 , and the @entity174			0
light - hearted : heros and beloved personalities alike can become doodles , as @entity178 did for what would have been her 100th birthday in 2012 in 1999 , the company began posting ‘ @entity112 ’ doodles around @entity110 but has never specifically referenced the @entity34 celebration			2
they tend , instead , to celebrate winter and the spirit of the holidays in general			0
and , oddly enough , 2006 ’s holiday doodles also celebrated @entity189			0
the point seems to be that @entity10 is not interested in celebrating the holidays of any specific religion , at all			2
just as there are no christian holidays , there are no @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity196 , @entity199 , @entity200 , or any other religious celebrations honored with @entity202			0
whether this is because there are so many , because the company wants to avoid placing one faith over another , or because they simply prefer not to just because is unclear			0
once : @entity10 posted an @entity150 only once , in 2000			1
not before or since has their @entity36 recognized any religious holiday to the credit of those angry at @entity10 ’s decision today , @entity10 has never before posted any @entity61 whatsoever on @entity37			1
then again , @entity99 has never , in its three - year history , fallen on @entity9			1
to put things in perspective , @entity10 has posted doodles with no religious significance during sacred holidays before			2
during @entity218 in 2012 , @entity10 honored the 100th birthday of a @entity221 photographer named @entity222 but not the @entity197 holiday			1
the @entity198 holiday of @entity225 coincided with the @entity226 in 2012 and @entity10 honored 17 sports events with doodles , as well as the birthdays of chef @entity178 , pilot @entity230 , and artist @entity231 , but made no mention of the holy month of fasting			1
and instead of the high @entity197 holiday of @entity236 in 2009 , @entity10 chose to celebrate its own 11th birthday .			2

*conservative* groups are calling for a boycott of the *ubiquitous* search giant in favor of others , like @entity107 's @entity108
march 31 became @entity99 by official @entity98 proclamation in 2011 and @entity10 honored him this year with a ' @entity246 '
@entity10 has *n't* had a doodle for the @entity9 holiday since 2000 and has never posted one specifically honoring @entity110 or any other religious observance
