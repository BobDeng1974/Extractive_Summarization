both @entity2 and @entity6 are facing the quarter - final second leg as if it were a final , and with good reason – with @entity9 already out of the way whoever progresses will feel they have one hand on the @entity13			1
the winners of this tie , currently being led 1 - 0 by @entity2 , will face @entity16 or @entity17 in the semi-final with one of @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 awaiting them in the final			1
@entity0 could have his first silverware by may if @entity2 finish the job on wednesday and the form book plays out in the remaining rounds			2
he was rested against @entity29 at the weekend but comes back into a game which @entity6 must face without arguably their most important player @entity31			1
@entity0 ’s @entity33 team - mate is suspended and so marking duties will switch to another of his compatriot - the 20 - year - old @entity36			0
@entity0 returns to @entity2 ’s line - up on wednesday for the club ’s biggest game of the season so far @entity39 celebrates after scoring against @entity6 int he quarter - final first leg with five goals in 16 games @entity0 has not had the goalscoring start many expected but he has already scored against @entity6 this season in the 3 - 0 league win two weeks ago			1
@entity2 are defending a 1 - 0 lead which means even a high - scoring defeat by a solitary goal will see them through			1
‘ people outside the dressing room might say we are favourites ’ said @entity2 coach @entity50			2
‘ but if we adopt that approach we will be making a big mistake			0
of the three big teams left [ in the competition ] only one will still be standing but we have to make sure it is us			0
’ @entity6 coach @entity59 has done his best to convince his players a comeback is possible			0
‘ we have to live every minute as if it were the last , ’ he said			0
he is expected to give @entity63 another chance to work his cup magic			0
@entity0 , @entity39 and @entity67 star @entity66 are all set to start against the league champions @entity70 newspapers ' as ' and ' @entity71 ' preview the game , which they say ' is a final ' @entity63 played in the first leg and is also due to be handed a start on wednesday evening ' it was two goals from the former @entity79 and @entity80 striker that saw @entity6 past @entity9 in the last round			1
the man who replaced him at @entity79 , @entity0 , will be partnered by @entity66 who has 19 goals already this season – four more than in the entire 2013 - 14 campaign			0
and @entity39 completes @entity2 ’s formidable front three			2
the @entity87 has scored 22 goals against @entity6 in 24 matches			0
he has scored in his last five games and the team has scored 14 goals in their last three away games			0
for an @entity6 side who will also be without midfielder @entity97 , a comeback looks a tall order but @entity59 ’s champions are never more dangerous than when they have been ruled out of contention – @entity50 has done his best all week to make sure that has not happened			2
