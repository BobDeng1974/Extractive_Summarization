mr @entity0 said the case was ' terrible ' and the most ' chilling ' in his 30 - year career a baby girl was beaten and shaken to the point of death in a series of ‘ macabre and chilling ’ attacks by her father , a high court judge has ruled			1
the 20 - year - old man subjected his daughter to ‘ diabolical ’ assaults which broke ‘ the most basic and elemental taboos which govern our society , ’ mr @entity0 found			1
in a judgement made public today he said the four - month - old child was saved after she collapsed and was taken to hospital			0
she was found to have a broken neck and severe damage to her spine			1
doctors who examined her also discovered that she had five broken ribs , inflicted over a three - month period , and as many as five fractures to both legs , suffered between mid-december last year and early january this year			1
there were numerous more minor wounds , grazes and bruises			0
the father – who has been jailed for 12 years - admitted in a statement to the @entity33 : ‘ i am a monster			1
’ however in a controversial decision by judges he has not been named , even though he is considered ‘ a serious risk to the public ’			0
his identity will remain unknown when he is released from prison , when he will be aged in his early thirties			1
mr @entity0 said in his @entity33 ruling , handed down in @entity46 in june but only published after the end of a @entity49 trial last month : ‘ this is a shocking catalogue of injuries			1
’ he added : ‘ this is a terrible case			0
in 30 years as a lawyer , of which the last thirteen were as a part - time judge , and after four years sitting as a full - time judge i have never read and heard evidence so macabre and chilling as i have heard here			1
this is not overblown or rhetorical language on my part			0
‘ the father admits that almost from the time that his beautiful newly - born daughter returned from hospital at eleven days old until 13th january 2014 when she was only four months old , he systematically subjected her to a series of diabolical attacks ( and i use for once the adjective advisedly ) , attacks of such frequency and severity that it was providential that she did not perish			1
‘ in his statement of 6th march 2013 , the father admits everything			0
‘ at this point , i would only say that i doubt that even if @entity78 or @entity79 were alive today and able to advise me , that they would be able to give me an explanation for conduct that is so completely at variance with any understanding of human nature , conduct which has no basis rational or irrational , so it seems to me , but which violates the most basic and elemental taboos which govern our society			0
’ the judgment was published only after the conclusion of a @entity49 trial in @entity46 last week in which the father was found guilty of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm			1
@entity99 , @entity46 @entity49 mr @entity0 said the baby ’s mother was ‘ controlling ’ , ‘ needy ’ and ‘ dictatorial ’			0
‘ she certainly knew how to wind the father up , ’ the judge said			1
the mother would watch pornography to provoke the father , who took over most of the care of the baby			0
the judge listed 19 kinds of assault to which the father subjected the baby while they were alone together , including pressing his thumb into her eye until it bled , throttling her , bending her double , holding her upside down and shaking her , bashing her head against a cupboard , forcing a bottle into her mouth until it bled , and submerging her in the bath so the baby had the sensation of drowning			2
the high court judge said : ‘ i can not conceive that the mother would not have been aware that something was amiss while these barbaric attacks were being carried out			2
’ mr @entity0 ’s family division ruling found that ‘ exceptionally serious crimes have been committed by the father ’ and that the girl ’s 19 - year - old mother ‘ is guilty of neglect ’			2
at the time of the ruling in june the father was free and living with his step - father , and had resumed a sexual relationship with the mother			0
mr @entity0 called on the @entity141 ‘ to make their decision about whether to prosecute at the soonest opportunity so that all aspects of this desperately tragic case can be concluded as soon as possible			0
’ the june judgment was published only after the conclusion of a @entity49 trial in @entity46 last week in which the father was found guilty of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm			2
the jury took just 90 minutes to bring in its verdict			0
the 20 - year - old was sentenced to 17 years , with 12 years to be served in prison before release on licence for five years			1
the @entity49 judge , judge @entity159 told the father : ‘ you do present a serious risk to the public			2
in order to do what i can to protect the public , i am going to maximise that term			0
’ but judge @entity159 ordered that the name of the man should remain secret			1
the judge is understood to have been concerned that nothing should allow the public to identify the child , who is now in local council care			2
the unusual decision means that naming the father has been banned by both judge @entity159 in the @entity49 and mr @entity0 in the @entity33			1
@entity179 mp @entity179 , a campaigner against secrecy in the courts , said : ‘ the evidence from the @entity184 scandal is that secrecy does not necessarily protect children			0
it should not be imagined that failing to name an offender is doing the right thing ‘ in this case , the wider public has been left at risk			0
it is doubtful that failing to name the monster will protect the child , but it certainly puts the rest of society at risk			2
so often secrecy has not protected the child – it has protected the abusers			0
’ during the @entity49 trial in @entity46 , judge @entity159 made an order under section 39 of the @entity204 , 1933 , prohibiting the publication of material which might identify the victim of the offences			2
these concerned the potential harm caused by being identified as the victim of a locally notorious crime			0
but the judge also took account of concerns from the local authority involved that if she was identified it could harm attempts to place her with a new family as well as make it harder for her to fully integrate with any new family			1
the judge made the point in court that he was not prohibiting the publication of the defendant ’s name , but that if the name was reported care had to be taken not to identify the relationship between the the convicted man and the victim .			1

the infant was found to have a broken neck and severe damage to spine
@entity239 , 20 , was condemned for ' diabolical ' assaults by @entity33 judge
the man , who has been jailed for 12 years , admitted : ' i am a monster '
however , he will not be identified until he is released from prison
