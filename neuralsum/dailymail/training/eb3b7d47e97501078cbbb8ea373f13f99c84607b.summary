here the police motorcycle rider pursues him at 154mph @entity6 escaped a jail sentence but was banned from the roads after a jury at @entity22 found him guilty of dangerous driving			1
the court heard the defendant failed to spot the police motorcycle following him on the northbound triple - lane carriageway in @entity28 , @entity29			0
