@entity0 is ' back on the hunt for success ' and itching to get back in the ring following back - to - back defeats to @entity7 super-middleweight rival @entity5			1
@entity0 first lost his unbeaten record as a professional to @entity10 and @entity11 champion @entity5 in controversial fashion before suffering a one - punch knockout in the eighth round of their return bout in front of an 80,000 crowd at @entity19			1
the @entity20 has not been put off by the setbacks , however , and is aiming to get back on the winning trail against @entity24 champion at 168lbs @entity25 in a contest that will also double as an eliminator for the @entity29 title			1
' the route chosen is a fantastic one , in my opinion			2
' @entity0 will be hoping victory on september 20 and a successful showing will land him a shot at either current @entity29 champion @entity46 or @entity47 , who fight each other next saturday			1
' it should be a tough match for both fighters , but either one i will beat after i defeat @entity25 , ' @entity0 added in his blog on @entity53			2
the fight with @entity25 takes place at @entity56 although @entity0 does not think there will be any mental scars as he returns to the place where he suffered his devastating defeat earlier this year			2
down and out : @entity0 ' world title rematch with @entity5 ended in disappointment as he was knocked out @entity64 v @entity30 highlights ' @entity56 has been a successful stomping ground in the past and i aim to continue this trend			1
' returning to @entity19 could well be a tough challenge in itself			0
' however , i know this wo n't be the case for me			0
i will relish the excitement of simulated emotions			0
it is when you most feel alive			0
' in front of 80,000 people , i had the time of my life			0
standing , parading and revelling in the atmosphere was one of my favourite and proudest moments			0
' i hope and plan to be involved in making boxing history again one day			0
' more to come : @entity0 , pictured here in action against @entity5 , has a plan to win the @entity29 world championship			1

@entity0 believes he is on the right path to win the @entity29 world title
he will earn himself a title shot if he beats @entity25
the *26* - year - old lost his previous two world title fights to @entity5
