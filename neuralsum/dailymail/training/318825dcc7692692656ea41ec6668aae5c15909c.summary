by @entity0 @entity2 professional football has been warned it faces a ‘ tsunami ’ of damaging legal claims that will cripple some clubs if managers continue to over-rule doctors and allow concussed players to play on			1
in an exclusive interview with the @entity12 , the @entity10 ’s senior doctor @entity9 this week said the @entity14 ’s massive legal settlement with former @entity16 footballers suffering from early on - set dementia linked to head injuries — now in excess of £ 870million — has set a precedent other sports would be foolish to ignore			1
the last @entity23 season saw an alarming number of incidences where managers ignored team doctors and allowed concussed players to return to play while this summer ’s @entity27 in @entity28 also saw players with head injuries , including @entity32 ’s @entity31 and @entity34 ’s @entity33 , play on			1
‘ for smaller clubs that could break them financially			1
we have to make sure they understand what the consequences are			0
‘ what we have to point out to clubs is that if your staff start over-ruling medical staff it may not be next year or the year after , but there are going to be difficulties			2
in 10 or 15 years if a player comes back and says : “ i ’ve got long - term brain damage because of this [ concussion mismanagement ] ” then it ’s going to be extremely difficult			2
it will get hauled through the courts and there will be a lot of bad publicity			0
the clubs will suffer one way or the other			0
we need to make sure they understand that			0
‘ when you ’ve got precedent of a tsunami [ the @entity14 pay out ] coming your way the best thing to do is to build your defence properly so you can withstand the tsunami			2
because it could come our way there is absolutely no doubt in my mind about that			0
’ last week the @entity10 announced their head - injury guidelines , in conjunction with the @entity23 and @entity96 , which state that all players who have lost consciousness or are suspected of losing consciousness must be removed from the field immediately			1
dr @entity9 , along with @entity10 chairman @entity102 , will hold an hour - long meeting at @entity104 ahead of today ’s @entity106 match with the family of former @entity2 and @entity109 centre forward @entity108 , who died in 2002 aged 59 suffering from dementia linked to heading footballs			1
a coroner found @entity108 ’s death was caused by ‘ industrial disease ’ while in may this year one of the world ’s pre-eminent neuropathologists , dr @entity118 , re-examined tissue samples from his brain and found evidence of @entity122 ( @entity122 ) – the same disease found in brains of deceased @entity16 footballers , boxers and rugby players			0
‘ the release of the concussion protocols for the new @entity23 season indicate a desire to progress this issue and i ’m encouraged by the @entity10 ’s leadership , ’ said dr @entity118 , who will accompany @entity130 ’s widow @entity129 and daughters at today ’s meeting			1
‘ my hope is it translates into meaningful initiatives beyond the first week of the season and that where the @entity10 lead , other associations in football and wider sport might follow			1
’ @entity23 case : @entity148 goalkeeper @entity147 was allowed to play on against @entity149 in november @entity102 apologised in april after a @entity12 investigation found that a joint @entity10 and @entity152 study into head injuries in football promised in 2002 was never completed , prompting @entity108 ’s family to accuse the authorities of ‘ sweeping the issue under the carpet ’			1
the have since set up a ‘ justice for @entity108 ’ campaign and have been approached by former professional players and their families convinced they are suffering similar neurological problems to the ones he faced			2
the family , who are not seeking financial compensation , will ask for the @entity10 to acknowledge their father ’s death was caused — at least in part — by playing football while also calling for an extensive new research project to be established and consideration given to a body being set up to support retired players suffering dementia			1
‘ we know that repetitive head injury causes @entity122 — i think that ’s reasonable from the evidence from the @entity181 — there ’s still some doubt about how that applies to football , ’ @entity9 added			2
‘ that ’s why we need more research			0
i do n’t have an axe to grind one way or another			0
i want to make the game safe			0
but we need to definitively understand what playing football does to brains			0

@entity10 's senior doctor @entity9 said massive @entity14 legal settlement linked with early on - set of dementia has set a precedent
last season a number of @entity23 managers ignored team doctors and allowed players to return to the field of play during matches
at the @entity28 @entity27 , @entity32 's @entity31 and @entity34 's @entity33 were also permitted to play on
@entity9 has warned clubs of effects of letting players go back on to the pitch
he says financial *implications* of settlements could break smaller clubs
last week @entity10 announced head - injury guidelines which state all players who lose consciousness or suspected of doing so must be taken off immediately
