by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 13:49 est , 7 march 2014 a controversial new bill proposed by a @entity4 politician could mark the end of popular @entity7 shows at @entity8			1
if passed , the bill would be the most comprehensive protection law for orcas held in captive , in the @entity13 for more than 40 years , according to the man behind the proposed legislation			2
state assembly member @entity16 , will introduce the @entity17 today			1
in one of the most tragic incidents involving killer whales at @entity21 , @entity22 ( pictured ) died after being grabbed by an orca the bill would make it illegal to ' hold in captivity , or use , a wild - caught or captive - bred orca for performance or entertainment purposes '			1
the proposed bill would also ban the artificial insemination of captive killer whales in the state of @entity4 and block the import of orcas or orca semen from other states			1
under the rules , those violating such a law , would face a fine of up to $ 100,000 and / or six months in prison			0
in a written statement mr @entity16 said : ' there is no justification for the continued captive display of orcas for entertainment purposes			1
' these beautiful creatures are much too large and far too intelligent to be confined in small , concrete pens for their entire lives			0
it is time to end the practice of keeping orcas captive for human amusement			0
' he said under the terms of the bill , the 10 orcas in captive at @entity8 in @entity60 , would be ' rehabilitated and returned to the wild where possible '			0
where that is not possible , the whales should be kept in a sea pen , that is open to the public but not used for entertainment purposes , mr @entity16 said			1

last month @entity96 state senator @entity95 introduced a bill to ban orca captivity			2
countries including @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 , have outlawed the captivity of all dolphins , whales and porpoises			1
dr @entity109 , marine mammal scientist at the @entity110 , said the bill was inspired by the orcas - in - captivity documentary @entity113			0
' the @entity113 effect has never been in greater evidence â€” everything has led to this , the first serious legislative proposal to prohibit the captive display of this highly intelligent and social species , ' dr @entity109 told take part			0
' @entity8 should join with this effort rather than continue to fight it			0
they can be on the right side of history			0
' mr @entity16 asked dr @entity109 and her team at @entity113 to help with the bill			2
