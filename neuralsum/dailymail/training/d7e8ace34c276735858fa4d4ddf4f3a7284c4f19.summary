the last time @entity1 were due at the @entity2 it was 2009 and @entity4 ’s interim president @entity3 predicted a 3 - 0 win live on @entity7 radio			1
he said @entity4 would ‘ blow @entity1 away ’ and he even threw in a ‘ 2 - 1 away victory ’ prediction for the second leg			1
@entity12 ’ @entity11 won 5 - 0 on aggregate ; @entity3 and @entity4 were humiliated			1
loose talk has been replaced by the sort of quiet confidence 11 straight wins ( including a 3 - 0 victory at @entity19 ) tend to breed			1
you wo n’t find any @entity4 players , coaches or directors calling the game with such contempt for the opposition , but a big home win is exactly what many of them are quietly expecting			2
@entity17 has scored four more league goals for @entity4 this season than @entity1 have managed @entity14 's men have won 11 on the trot , including seven straight wins in the league @entity1 have scored 13 league goals so far this season – that is four less than @entity17 has managed on his own			1
@entity4 ’s interim president @entity3 predicted a 3 - 0 win in 2009 ; they lost both legs after brushing aside @entity1 a fortnight ago @entity4 beat @entity58 to move within one point of them , and this weekend they climbed above them in the table , going top , with another easy 4 - 0 away win that had @entity63 asking after the game if perhaps this was the greatest @entity4 side he had played in			1
real were always going to be a difficult proposition for @entity1 in @entity68 , but when they lost away to @entity69 earlier in the campaign – a club currently one off the bottom and with a recently sacked manager – it was a glimmer of hope for the @entity11 that perhaps their summer spending spree had unsettled the balance established last season			0
@entity14 has ironed out the rough spots in record time however and @entity4 are now playing better than at any time under the @entity82 ’s management			2
@entity84 ’s enforced absence has actually aided that process with a midfield quartet of @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 all on the same wavelength in a midfield that keeps the ball as well as @entity94 ’s @entity58 did			0
' we do n’t want to be compared with anyone			0
we have our own philosophy , ' said @entity89 when asked about that very comparison on sunday			0
@entity4 are perhaps still slightly more direct than that great @entity58 side and a fraction more goal - hungry too			2
@entity1 ran out 5 - 0 winners on aggregate after a 4 - 0 win at @entity19 and a fine performance in @entity4 midfielder @entity106 scores the only goal of the game back in 2009 at the @entity2 @entity109 hails ' fantastic ' @entity17 and calls for real to maintain form if they continue at the current scoring rate they will finish the season with 140 goals with almost 70 of them coming from the boots and head of @entity17 , who is ready to run riot again against @entity1 ’s shaky rearguard			1
it was @entity4 that were shaky five years ago			0
they were passing through moments of great instability with @entity126 briefly replacing @entity127 as coach and the aforementioned @entity3 even more briefly replacing @entity129 as president			0
@entity126 had pulled things together with seven straight wins in the league but @entity3 ’s confidence was very misplaced , especially against a @entity12 team that had @entity136 and @entity137 both in their pomp			2
@entity4 have a good chance of avenging that 5 - 0 aggregate defeat five years ago ' it ’s easy for him to say because he will be watching the game from directors ' box ; he wo n’t be on the pitch , ' said then @entity4 player @entity148 of @entity3 ’s unhelpful comments			1
' there are no easy games ' said @entity126 before he watched his side lose the first leg to a @entity106 goal and the second at @entity19 to a @entity136 double , a @entity137 strike and another from @entity158			2
with the @entity19 meeting already behind them – and won at such a canter – @entity4 supporters ca n’t wait for tuesday night			0
the sunday papers all carried sizeable match reports from @entity1 ’s defeat at @entity166			0
there has never been a better time to avenge that 5 - 0 aggregate scoreline from five years ago .			0

in 2009 , @entity4 interim president @entity3 predicted a 3 - 0 win
they lost the game 1 - 0 , and the return leg 4 - 0 at @entity19
but with 11 straight victories , @entity4 have a good chance *ofrevenge*
@entity17 has four more goals than @entity1 have this term
@entity14 's side are on fire at the moment , with @entity63 *wondering* if this is the best ever @entity4 team he has ever played in
