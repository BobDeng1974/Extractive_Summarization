the space agency is tracking a regional storm on @entity8 , but says it has so far not affected the operations of @entity10 - its two rovers on the surface			2
the storm raging in the planet ’s southern hemisphere was spotted earlier this month by the @entity16 circling high above the planet			0
in the dust : this image taken by @entity2 's @entity16 of a dust storm in the @entity8 southern hemisphere taking bites out of @entity8 : curiosity has been taking samples of @entity8 soil and analyzing them clouds : this image of a dust storm was captured by @entity2 in 2007 the storm came within 840 miles of @entity30 's location			1
on the opposite side of the red planet , a weather station aboard @entity2 's newest rover , @entity10 , detected changes in air pressure and overnight temperature related to the storm			1
scientists want to learn more about @entity8 dust storms , including why some morph into storms that can blanket the entire planet			1
@entity44 , chief @entity8 scientist at @entity2 's @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , said in a statement : ' this is now a regional dust storm			1
' it has covered a fairly extensive region with its dust haze , and it is in a part of the planet where some regional storms in the past have grown into global dust hazes			0
' discoveries : news of the dust storm comes after the curiosity rover made a major discovery on the red planet - but scientists are keeping quiet about what it is signs of life ? curiosity is capable of identifying organic compounds - carbon containing substances that could indicate life on @entity8 he added : ' for the first time since the @entity75 missions of the 1970s , we are studying a regional dust storm both from orbit and with a weather station on the surface			1
' in 2001 , a dust storm appeared to engulf @entity8 before dissipating about two months later			2
if this latest storm turns into a global one , the solar - powered opportunity would see an energy decline			0
@entity10 , which is powered by plutonium , wo n't be as directly affected			0
news of the dust storm comes after the curiosity rover made a major discovery on the @entity8 - but scientists are keeping quiet about what it is			2
mystery : in 2001 , a dust storm captured by the @entity94 appeared to engulf @entity8 before dissipating about two months later the finding was made by the six - wheeled rover 's @entity96 at @entity8 ( @entity99 ) instrument in the @entity101 area of the @entity102 , close to where the rover touched down			2
@entity99 is @entity10 's on - board chemistry lab and is able to take a sample of @entity8 rock , soil or air and find out what it is made of			0
most importantly , it is capable of identifying organic compounds - carbon containing substances that could indicate life			0
except scientists are refusing to reveal its latest finding , merely saying that it is earthshaking .			0

dust storm in southern hemisphere of @entity8 has so far not affected @entity2 's two rovers - @entity10 and opportunity
scientists hoping to learn more about @entity8 dust storms
pictures from 2001 show a *similar* dust storm that engulfed the red planet
