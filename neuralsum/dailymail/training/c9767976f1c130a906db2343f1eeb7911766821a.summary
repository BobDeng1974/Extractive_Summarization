when they decided to sell the beautiful object , auctioneers @entity24 expected it to fetch between £ 30,000 and £ 50,000			1
but at the auction of antiquities in @entity17 yesterday , the bowl was sold to an unnamed buyer for £ 481,250			1
made using the lost - wax casting method , the shallow bowl features a flared rim decorated with twelve projecting tear - shaped lobes interspersed with twelve elongated petals			2
rare : the green glass vessel would have been a high - status object when it was made 2,500 years ago the @entity2 was founded in the 6th century @entity14 by @entity40 , who to this day is venerated as one of the greatest figures in @entity2 history			1
its rulers presided over the largest empire in the history of the world at the time , stretching from @entity50 and @entity51 as far as modern - day @entity52			2

' this bowl really is one of a kind , ' said @entity24 ' head of antiquities @entity75			2
' bowls like this were made by expert craftsmen and were not mass produced			0
' they are incredibly rare and hardly ever come on the market			0
the fact that this one is still intact after 2,500 years is amazing			0
' we knew it was a special item and our pre-sale estimate was conservative , but we were n't expecting it to do quite as well as it did			0
' there was a real buzz in the auction room with bids coming in from all angles			0
' we had the real pleasure of breaking the good news to the vendor at the end of the auction			0
' the bowl dates back to the time of the @entity2 , the first dynasty to rule over all of modern - day @entity100			1
it was made shortly before @entity70 king @entity7 invaded in 334 bc. the exact history of the bowl before it came to the @entity21 is unknown , but it would have been a highly prized object owned by a wealthy @entity2 family .			1
