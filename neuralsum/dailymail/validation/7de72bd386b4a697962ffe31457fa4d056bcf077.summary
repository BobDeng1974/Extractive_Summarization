it 's not all in the stars for guests when it comes to comparing the best hotels around @entity5			2
while five stars seems like a fairly straight - forward measurement , hotel and resort ratings are n't all created equal as there is no uniform ratings system to keep it simple for tourists			2
according to research by @entity15 , 71 per cent of us do n't realise that a five - star hotel in @entity17 can differ significantly to one in @entity18 , @entity19 or @entity20			1
the exclusive @entity21 must live up to demanding standards of service to be a @entity25 five - star hotel @entity27 's ratings system was put together by the tourism department and enforced by the government , and five - star hotels such as @entity32 's @entity31 must live up to specific exacting standards at @entity25 five - stars , guests being welcomed on arrival is among their many criteria for qualification each country has its own way to rank hotels from one - star to five and beyond , all with their own set of priorities and standards established by a range of authorities from local tourism bodies to government			1
in @entity18 , star ratings focus heavily on customer service , with a hotel not qualifying as a five - star without a greeting at the entrance and multilingual staff , along with a high quality food and wine menu and many other factors			1
while @entity25 standards are agreed by the @entity61 ) , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , @entity27 's exacting standards on what makes a five - star hotel - based on rooms , lobbies , services and amenities - were decided by their tourism authority and are enforced by the @entity29			1
a long list of criteria for a five - star hotel in @entity27 , such as the @entity77 in @entity78 , includes staff speaking @entity80 and one other foreign language , valet parking , multiple pools and kids clubs standards for @entity17 hotels , such as the @entity88 , are regulated regionally along with opulent interiors , @entity17 's @entity89 must have a 24 - hour concierge service to be five - star in spain must offer the highest luxury specially adapted rooms for wheelchair users and will often provide extra facilities 24 - hour reception and 24 - hour concierge award - winning on - site dining facilities rooms cleaned daily , including fresh towels and bed linen , and a trouser press in france immaculate settings staff speak @entity80 and one other language multiple pools , fitness centre , health and spa centres and kids clubs 24 - hour room service satellite television with a good range of channels in @entity18 guests are greeted at the hotel entrance high quality menu and wine list licensed bar or lounge service with attention to detail and quality formal reception and porters ' desks with uniformed staff offering proactive service extensive range of facilities , including leisure , retail and conference services			1
in @entity20 offer at least three foreign language capabilities single rooms at least nine square meters and double at least 16 square meters an elevator bed sheet and towels changed daily @entity144 cleaning and the room to be re-set in the afternoon			0
free transfer service for clients and baggage in @entity18 guests are greeted at the hotel entrance high quality menu and wine list licensed bar or lounge service with attention to detail and quality formal reception and porters ' desks with uniformed staff offering proactive service extensive range of facilities , including leisure , retail and conference services			2
@entity17 's five - star hotels are crowned regionally rather than nationally , meaning discrepancies are possible , but to be top of the line a hotel must have 24 - hour reception and concierge , award - winning onsite dining facilities and the rooms must be cleaned daily			1
for the @entity20 , cleanliness is next to godliness for five - star hotels in their uniform star - rating system established in 2009 - a one - star hotel need only change bed sheets once a week but five - star , you 'll be pleased to know , have to change them daily			1
most hotels in @entity19 are inspected by the @entity187 while a similar system in compulsory in @entity189 and regulated @entity190			0
@entity20 's hotel ratings system , established in 2009 , is judged heavily on its standards of cleanliness along with its 18th - century design by @entity197 , sheets are changed daily in @entity20 five - star hotels free @entity199 65 % @entity80 - speaking staff 53 % swimming pool 48 % guest parking 41 % 24 - hour reception 40 % a safe in the room 39 % laundry and ironing services 11 % concierge services 9 % children 's club 7 % a minibar in the room 7 % a computer in the room 7 % step - free access 6 % fresh flowers / present ( e.g. chocolates ) in the room on arrival 4 % sewing kit / shoe polish kit in the room 4 % source : @entity15 as a member of @entity226 ( @entity227 in @entity5 ) , @entity224 accommodation has complied with their classification system since 2013 with star ratings covering a combination of 270 compulsory and optional measurements			1
with such differences , @entity15 's commercial manager @entity233 recommends tourists use a combination of peer and official review systems when making travel choices			0
' when booking a hotel , it 's important to be as well informed as possible and confident with your choice , ' says @entity15 's commercial manager @entity233			0
' understandably , customers may sometimes find star ratings confusing			0
the @entity20 government , for example , have implemented a system that rates cleanliness as one of the most important aspects with the highest rated hotels being cleaned twice a day			2
@entity27 , on the other hand , focuses on more luxury and conveniences , such as room size , the location of the hotel and its amenities			0
' despite the variances , star ratings do give a good indication of the standard of the hotel			0
that 's why we 'd encourage using both peer - to - peer reviews and star ratings for the best hotel choice			0
