these are the breathtaking bird 's eye view shots a paraglider took as he soared in the skies above the @entity4			1
@entity5 , 48 , has spent the past three years with his head in the clouds and his camera ready to take beautiful aerial shots of the well trodden landscape			1
the photographer , who learnt to paraglide in the @entity12 in 1987 , used a @entity13 to take more than 360 photographs at 70 locations in @entity4			1
@entity5 , who lives in @entity16 , @entity17 , said : ' right from the start , i realised the huge potential for taking unusual landscape images from this privileged viewpoint normally restricted to the birds			1
dramatic : @entity5 took this flying above @entity26 and @entity27 , which he described as ' always a treat			2
in late november the contrast between the russet coloured bracken , the dry dead fell grass and green fields is most dramatic ' an unusual view of the north - western @entity4 with @entity16 and @entity36 made up of a series of vertical shots stitched together to create the panorama			1
' the light was problematic as i was looking directly into the sun and there were deep shadows , ' added @entity5 incredible : the view of @entity47 , @entity48 and the @entity49			2
@entity5 said : ' occasionally you are rewarded with amazing flying when you just do n't expect it			2
i walked up @entity54 intending to have a quick fly down at sunset			0
the wind was just enough to keep me airborne then a small thermal took me high above the ridge giving me this incredible view			0
not bad for late february ' ' a paraglider is typically only flying at around 20mph which gives you a good amount of control and time to compose shots			2
' the downside is you are at the mercy of the wind and air currents as well as your own ability to use those air currents to stay up and move around			0
' he claims his love of paragliding has helped boost his love of photography			0
' it takes me to places people do n't usually see , it is a truly amazing way of experiencing @entity4 , ' he said			2
' a lot of people take a camera with them when they go flying but not everybody takes a high quality camera and can take the time to get into position to take a decent picture			2
' using mainly wide angles , @entity5 was able to capture beautiful panoramic shots without compromise			1
@entity5 says he flew in special conditions above the @entity96 with @entity97 in front and @entity99 below to capture this picture where his feet make an appearance			1
' the cloud was forming below us and we had to be careful where we flew so as not to lose sight of the ground , ' he said captured during an evening flight with a friend on @entity110			0
@entity5 said : ' the sun was shining through gaps in the cloud just before sunset , painting the crags and scree in a golden light , a magical time of the day to be up here ' but @entity5 says no matter how spectacular a scene , he sometimes refrains from letting go off the controls to take up his camera for safety reasons			1
' carrying and operating a bulky and heavy slr in the air is not ideal when trying to maintain control of the wing ; not hitting anything is a priority and essential to my health and continued enjoyment of life , ' he said			2
' occasionally the air is too rough and no matter how spectacular the scene around , i dare not release the controls to take up my camera for fear of losing control			2
' @entity5 captured this while looking down to the @entity140 and @entity139 with the @entity141 flowing out into @entity36 @entity142 : @entity5 says he created a special harness and uses a remote control to trigger the shutter to capture self - portraits including this one over @entity147 , @entity36 , near @entity16 ultimate selfie : paraglider pilot @entity5 took this on warm summer evening flying above @entity151 and @entity36			1
' a fast shutter speed is required here to freeze the movement			0
a bit of background blur indicates i was spinning quite fast , ' he said and @entity5 has even managed a few ' selfies ' using a specially made harness and a remote control to trigger the shutter			1
he said : ' i have experimented with self portraits whilst flying , the view from up high in the wing looking straight down with the glider lines leading the eye straight to the pilot is very effective , especially when combined with a spectacular backdrop			0
' i have rigged up an extra line in my wing that i attach my camera to in a specially made harness			0
this line goes up from me to a pulley near the top of my glider and then back down to me			0
' during stable flight i can pull on one end and hoist the camera up towards the canopy itself			0
to stop the camera swinging wildly about i have two short lines with clips attached to the camera strap lugs that act like side lines which i clip onto glider lines to run up and down			0
@entity5 , pictured , first learnt to paraglide in the @entity12 in 1987			0
' right from the start , i realised the huge potential for taking unusual landscape images from this privileged viewpoint normally restricted to the birds , ' he said ' i use a remote control to trigger the shutter			1
' for 20 years , @entity5 worked as an exploration geologist , traveling to remote locations around the globe			1
it allowed him to go climbing , paragliding and exploring armed with a camera			0
since starting his company @entity200 with friend and rock climber @entity202 , @entity5 has amassed a vertigo - inducing collection of shots of the region			2
he has spent three years photographing and writing a book called photographing the @entity4 , the first book in a series of ten			1
the other nine will cover different parts of the @entity211			0
@entity5 said : ' i have been paragliding over 20 years and took photos from the air in all that time			1
' there are no aerial shots in the book			1
' the book is designed for anyone with an interest in the @entity4 to direct them to some of the most beautiful places and help them take amazing photographs			2
' beautiful : from around 4500ft , @entity5 managed to take this over @entity225 and @entity226			0
@entity5 said : ' these days are relatively rare when the air is so clear and conditions for paragliding are optimal ' looking down onto @entity230 with @entity231 above it and @entity110 beyond from around 4500ft			0
@entity5 said : ' after taking off from the side of @entity235 i used thermal currents to get high and bob along to fly over the highest peaks of the central fells ' @entity240 and part of @entity243 slate mines looking down @entity244 towards @entity245			1
' sometimes it 's nice to get closer to the landscape with a longer lens or selective cropping , ' said @entity5 abstract : a fellow glider is seen over this jagged path up @entity252 on @entity253			2
@entity5 said : ' by cropping tightly to remove all distractions and reference to location the path up @entity252 on @entity257 is turned into an abstract ' long shadows can be seen towards the end of the day at @entity261 above @entity16			1
' i landed in the centre of the circle just as a coach load of tourists arrived , it 's not often you get a round of applause on landing , ' said @entity5 flying above his home patch of the @entity16 valley , @entity5 said : ' sometimes from up high the air is so clear you can see @entity276 in @entity277 , the @entity278 of @entity279 and @entity280 just 25 miles to the north ' a tiny paraglider can be seen in the top left hand of this image over @entity36 , @entity285 and @entity257			1
' april in the @entity4 is the start of the good flying season with strong thermals and longer hours of daylight			0
i took off from @entity290 which is the hill at bottom right ' @entity97 and @entity99 with @entity245 off to the left and @entity294 on the right			0
' this was one of those days where you could almost fly anywhere in the @entity4			0
i spent 4 hours in the air photographing around the @entity300 , i was absolutely buzzing with the experience when i got down , ' said @entity5 @entity302 : looking down to @entity303 and @entity304 from around 5000ft			1
' one of my best flights in the @entity4 , we took off from above @entity308 near @entity226 and i flew back home to @entity16 high over the mountains ' the red sandstone cliffs of @entity312 , the most westerly point of both @entity17 and @entity314			1
' coastal flying is quite different to inland flying , the air off the sea is usually very smooth without a ripple to disturb you			0
this makes photography much less stressful not having to worry about your glider so much ' said @entity5			0

@entity5 , 48 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , has spent two years taking aerial shots of the well trodden landscape
used a @entity13 slr camera to take more than 360 photographs at 70 locations in @entity4
took ' selfies ' using a special harness and a remote control to trigger the shutter
the photos , some taken from as high as *5,000ft* , feature in the first of a series of 10 books called photographing the @entity4
