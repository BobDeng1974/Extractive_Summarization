@entity1 war planes will begin air strikes on @entity3 today amid a spiralling political row over whether they should also hit @entity7 fanatics in neighbouring @entity8			1
six @entity9 are expected to join @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity13 air strikes – their first in @entity3 for six years – after mps voted overwhelmingly to go into a third @entity15			1
warning that the fight to crush @entity18 could last for years , not months , @entity16 told an emergency session of @entity20 that as well as murdering @entity22 hostages with ‘ staggering brutality ’ the group was plotting terrorist attacks in @entity1			1
‘ we do have to realise that whether we like it or not , they have already declared war on us			0
’ mps authorised military action by 524 votes to 43 , one of the biggest commons majorities since the last general election			1
but last night @entity43 education spokesman @entity42 resigned , saying she could not support air strikes			1
and defence spokesman @entity45 was forced to sack aide @entity46 for voting against strikes in @entity3			2
mr @entity16 said that there was a ‘ strong case ’ for extending air strikes against @entity18 , also known as @entity51 or @entity51 , from @entity3 into @entity8 , where it has also seized vast areas			1
@entity16 leaving @entity20 after mps backed the @entity56 motion authorising military action against is @entity18 now controls territory the size of the @entity1			1
‘ i am very clear : @entity51 needs to be destroyed in @entity8 as well as @entity3 , ’ he said			2
‘ we support the action that the @entity10 and five @entity13 states have taken in @entity8			2
’ the prime minister even suggested he might be prepared to intervene in @entity8 without seeking a vote in @entity20 if it would avert a ‘ humanitarian catastrophe ’ or there was an immediate threat to @entity1			1
but he ruled out deploying @entity1 combat troops – though special forces are already operating in the region , and troops may be deployed to train regional forces acting on the ground			2
although @entity43 leader @entity75 backed action in @entity3 , he prompted a backlash from both @entity78 and @entity79 by saying @entity1 would have to seek a @entity81 resolution authorising any attacks on @entity8			1
this is the text of the motion passed by mps after a six - hour debate : ' that this @entity87 condemns the barbaric acts of @entity51 against the peoples of @entity3 including the @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 and the humanitarian crisis this is causing ; ' recognises the clear threat @entity51 poses to the territorial integrity of @entity3 and the request from the @entity56 for military support from the international community and the specific request to the @entity103 for such support ; ' further recognises the threat @entity51 poses to wider international security and the @entity1 directly through its sponsorship of terrorist attacks and its murder of a @entity1 hostage ; ' acknowledges the broad coalition contributing to military support of the @entity56 including countries throughout the @entity114 ; ' further acknowledges the request of the @entity56 for international support to defend itself against the threat @entity51 poses to @entity3 and its citizens and the clear legal basis that this provides for action in @entity3 ; ' notes that this motion does not endorse @entity1 air strikes in @entity8 as part of this campaign and any proposal to do so would be subject to a separate vote in @entity20 ; ' accordingly supports @entity103 , working with allies , in supporting the @entity56 in protecting civilians and restoring its territorial integrity , including the use of @entity1 air strikes to support @entity3 , including @entity136 , security forces ' efforts against @entity51 in @entity3 ; ' notes that @entity103 will not deploy @entity1 troops in ground combat operations ; ' and offers its wholehearted support to the men and women of @entity144 's armed forces			1
' this effectively blocks the government from taking action because @entity148 has already pledged to veto any such resolution			0
‘ in my view , when we are not talking about being invited in by a democratic state it would be better – i put it no higher than that – it would be better to seek a @entity159 resolution , ’ he told the @entity151			0
however , his stance was criticised by some senior @entity43 figures because it effectively leaves the decision in the hands of @entity148			2
former minister @entity164 said : ‘ why is it right to come to the aid of the victims of @entity51 who are living under a democracy in @entity3 but not those who are living under a dictatorship in @entity8 ? ’ backing military action , @entity43 leader @entity75 said ' although this is difficult , it 's the right thing to do ' former @entity43 defence secretary @entity174 said : ‘ my concern has been that we ’ve almost closed down any sort of action in @entity8 , we ’ve closed down any discussion about support troops on the ground and i would much prefer those options to be kept open			1
’ defence secretary @entity183 suggested the government might ask mps to support extending air strikes into @entity8			1
‘ @entity51 is based in @entity8 , that ’s where its headquarters are , that ’s where its resources , its people are , ’ he said			0
‘ to deal with @entity51 you do have to deal and defeat them in both @entity3 and in @entity8			2
’ shadow foreign secretary @entity192 later said that @entity43 would not insist on a @entity81 resolution before considering action in @entity8			2
@entity195 gave his backing to air strikes in @entity3 , telling the @entity87 that the ' perverted ’ ideology of @entity18 was just one part of a global problem the @entity201 of @entity202 gave his backing to air strikes in @entity3 , but issued a pointed warning to religious leaders to ‘ up their game ’ against the threat of radical @entity208			1
@entity195 told the @entity87 that the ‘ twisted and perverted ’ ideology of @entity18 was just one part of a global problem			0
he said there was justification for armed force in the short - term to help victims of their ‘ dreadful brutality ’			0
but military action could not solve what is a ‘ global , ideological , religious and trans - generational challenge ’ which threatens to plunge the world into ‘ endless darkness ’			0
‘ religious leaders must up their game , ’ he said , ‘ and the church is playing its part ... the action proposed today is right , but we must not rely on a short - term solution			2
‘ we must demonstrate that there is a positive vision far greater and more compelling than the evil of @entity18 and its global clones			0
’ the debate in the @entity87 , in which dozens of peers spoke , saw a majority in favour of air strikes			1
@entity240 , for the government , said that destroying the ‘ evil extremism ’ of @entity18 in @entity3 would be in the interests of @entity1 ’s national security			1
but former @entity245 minister @entity244 , the @entity246 , said that ‘ we should hold our fire ’			0
he said : ‘ our mind is not closed and we have not made a @entity159 resolution a condition of future action … our moral compass is not set in @entity253 or @entity254 … we have said very clearly that there is a legal basis for action			0
’ opening an often impassioned six - and - a - half hour debate , mr @entity16 warned that @entity18 posed a direct threat to @entity1 that could not be ignored			1
‘ this is not a threat on the far side of the world , ’ he said			0
‘ left unchecked , we will face a terrorist caliphate on the shores of the @entity266 , bordering a @entity268 member , with a declared and proven determination to attack our country and our people			0
’ mr @entity16 said the war against @entity51 would take ‘ not just months , but years ’ , adding : ‘ the hallmarks of this campaign will be patience and persistence , not shock and awe			0
’ outside @entity20 , protesters held placards which read ' @entity280 ' but inside the @entity281 insisted the situation was different to the @entity283 ordered by @entity284 some relatives of kidnapped @entity1 taxi driver @entity286 , the latest hostage threatened with beheading by @entity18 , have warned that air strikes could reduce their chances of ever seeing him again			1
but foreign secretary @entity292 insisted the attacks would make little difference to the fate of westerners held by @entity18			0
@entity298 preacher @entity297 and seven other men were released on bail last night after being questioned by counter terrorism detectives			0
@entity297 , 47 , and ten other members of his inner circle were arrested in @entity304 and @entity305 , @entity306 , on suspicion of supporting banned extremist group @entity307 , which he co-founded almost 20 years ago			0
his friend , @entity309 , 39 , now known as @entity309 , was charged with breaching a counter terrorism order by giving police false information			0
he will appear before magistrates today .			0
