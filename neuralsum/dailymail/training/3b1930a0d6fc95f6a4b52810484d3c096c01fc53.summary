for the first time in a century , it seems people in the @entity3 are leaving the suburbs for cities			2
since the invention of the automobile in 1888 , the rate of suburban population growth has consistently outpaced that of urban centers			1
but in 2011 - for the first time in a hundred years - the trend reversed			2
demographics , environmental concerns and rising energy costs all play roles , according to @entity18 : where the @entity19 is moving , a new book that charts the rise and fall of @entity3 suburbia			1
end of the white picket fence ? since the invention of the automobile , the rate of suburban population growth has outpaced that of urban centers			1
but in 2011 - for the first time in a hundred years - the trend reversed ' powerful social trends are shrinking and transforming the @entity3 nuclear family , long the dominant driver of suburbia , ' wrote the author , @entity34			1
' simply speaking , more and more @entity3 do nâ€™t want to live there anymore			2
' originally , suburbs were quaint , tree - lined villages			2
but the @entity39 housing shortage , and low - interest loans for the middle class led to the suburban house becoming as much a part of the @entity19 as two kids and a dog			1
moving out : some experts say that the era of cookie - cutter suburban homes that have been iconic of the @entity3 dream since the 1950s may be over forever as suburbs grew , so to did ' a lack of cultural amenities ' , explains ms @entity34 , who is also the assistant managing editor of @entity54			1
suburbs , she says , lead to ' miles and miles of @entity56 ' , and longer and longer commutes			1
according to the @entity58 , the average @entity3 takes 25.4minutes to get to work every day - and 10.8million face trips of more than an hour			0
but rising energy costs mean that for many people , these trips are becoming less economical			1
battered by the job market , some young people - nicknamed ' @entity66 ' because they are , increasingly , delaying home ownership - are also choosing to settle in diverse urban areas			0
changing demographics : since the 1950s the suburb system has depended on cars and highways , but now high energy costs are making long commutes unaffordable for many people ' construction permit data shows that in several cities , building activity that was once concentrated in the suburban fringe has now shifted primarily to cities , or what planners call the " urban core " ' , ms @entity34 writes			1
@entity86 builders claim that @entity87 are out , while condominiums , townhouses , and multi-family housing units that emphasize efficient use of space are the future			0
end of the @entity55 ' gone are the master bathrooms you can land planes in , ' said @entity97 , the editorial director of the @entity98 of magazines at the housing research and publishing firm @entity100 , said recently			0
in 2012 , the @entity103 ' concept home ' was a series of three homes , each sized to house a different generation			0
@entity34 writes that some suburbs will survive : ironically , in many communities there is a movement for @entity111 that creates more pedestrian - friendly areas			0
but @entity113 , a @entity114 economist and founder of the @entity116 , says that the constant expansion of the past few decades could be over forever			0
' suburban prices may not recover in our lifetime , ' he adds			2
whatever happens , ms @entity34 believes that we will have more options			0
' there is no single @entity19 anymore , ' she writes			0
' there are multiple @entity3 dreams , and multiple @entity125			0

new book , @entity18 , explains how changing economic trends are making a suburban *lifestyle* less *desirable*
rising energy costs are making commutes unaffordable
