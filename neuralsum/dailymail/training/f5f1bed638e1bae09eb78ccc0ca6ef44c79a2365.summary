by @entity1 reporter published : 03:18 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 07:37 est , 17 october 2012 an @entity3 - sized planet has been found orbiting a star in @entity5 , our nearest neighbouring solar system			1
the mystery world circling @entity5 is thought to be much too hot to support life , with surface temperatures of around @entity11			1
but astronomers say it is likely to be part of a more extensive solar system containing other planets , one or more of which might be habitable			1
next - door neighbour : an artist 's impression of the recently found planet orbiting @entity5 , a member of the triple star system that is the closest to our own at just 4.3 light years from the @entity27 , @entity5 is only a step away in astronomical terms ; still , with current propulsion technology it would take a probe 40,000 years to get there			1
nevertheless , astronomers described the discovery as ' extraordinary ' and did not rule out the possibility of sending an unmanned space mission there in the not - too - distant future			0
@entity38 , of the @entity39 in @entity40 , said : ' this result represents a major step towards the detection of a twin @entity3 in the immediate vicinity of the sun. we live in exciting times			0
' the planet was detected by @entity49 ( @entity49 ) astronomers who measured tiny wobbles in the motion of @entity5 caused by a gravitational tug of war with the orbiting planet			1
the planet orbiting @entity5 was found using a high - precision instrument called @entity57 on the @entity49 's 3.5m telescope at @entity59 in @entity60 , pictured above			1
@entity57 measures the radial velocity of a star — its speed towards or away from the @entity3 — with extraordinary precision			0
a planet in orbit around a star causes the star to regularly move towards and away from a distant observer on @entity3			0
due to the doppler effect , this radial velocity change induces a shift of the star ’s spectrum towards longer wavelengths as it moves away ( called a redshift ) and a blueshift ( towards shorter wavelengths ) as it approaches			0
this tiny shift of the star ’s spectrum can be measured with a high - precision spectrograph such as @entity57 and used to infer the presence of a planet			1
a high - precision instrument called @entity57 on the @entity49 's 3.6m telescope at @entity59 in @entity60 was used to spot minute light wave fluctuations generated by the wobbles			1
data published today in the journal nature show that the as - yet unnamed planet is unusually light , containing only a little more material than the @entity3			2
it is the lightest exoplanet ever found orbiting a @entity27 - like star			1
the planet hugs its parent star at a distance of just six million kilometres - much nearer than @entity98 is to the @entity27 - making a complete orbit every 3.2 days			1
its surface is so hot it would probably resemble molten lava , the researchers say			0
however previous experience tells the scientists that when you find one low - mass exoplanet of this kind , it is likely to be part of a bigger family			2
the astronomers also know that @entity5 has a stable ' habitable zone ' , also known as the ' @entity114 '			2
this is the orbital band where conditions would be ' just right ' to support surface water and , potentially , life			2
leading @entity120 planet hunter and astronomer professor @entity119 , from the @entity122 at @entity123 , said : ' i think the prospects are excellent for finding further planets in this system			2
' everything we know indicates that when you find one planet like this you 're very likely to find additional planets further out , so it 's very exciting in terms of looking forward to further detection			0
' @entity5 is our closest neighbour			2
this is our back yard , and to find out that planet formation is occurring there is just extraordinary			0
' @entity5 in the constellation of @entity142 ( @entity143 ) : the star @entity5 , marked with a red circle , is one of the brightest stars in the southern sky			1
it lies just 4.3 light - years from the @entity3 and one component in a triple star system the scientists say they are ' 99.9 per cent ' sure they have not been fooled by a false result caused by background noise in the data			1
co-author dr @entity155 , also from @entity39 , said : ' this is the first planet with a mass similar to @entity3 ever found around a star like the @entity27 amateur astronomers have discovered a new planet that not only orbits two suns but is simultaneously being orbited by two other suns			1
the incredible four sun solar system , the first of its kind ever discovered , was found as part of the @entity167 project led by a team from @entity169			2
amateur enthusiasts work alongside professional scientists to analyse data collected by @entity174 's kepler space telescope and find evidence of new worlds the planet , called @entity178 , a gas giant slightly bigger than @entity179 , has being likened to @entity180 , the fictional two - sun planet and childhood home of @entity184 from the @entity186 films			0
but while @entity180 is a circumbinary planet , the likes of which have been known to scientists for some time , @entity178 takes things even further with an extra two suns orbiting the entire set - up			2
it means if someone were able to stand on @entity178 , they would be able to see a double sunset as well as two extremely bright stars far off in the night sky			0
the quadruple star system , roughly 3,200 light - years from @entity3 , has been named @entity200 4862625			1
' its orbit is very close to its star and it must be much too hot for life as we know it , but it may well be just one planet in a system of several			1
' further ' wobble ' observations will difficult to carry out until the two a and @entity210 stars move further apart in a few years time			0
but if the astronomers are lucky they might spot a ' transit ' - the crossing of a planet in front of its star as seen from the @entity3			2
when this happens the star light dims very slightly , betraying the planet 's presence			1
increasing numbers of planets are now being detected in this way			0
members of the same @entity225 team made the first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet in 1995			0
since then there have been more than 800 confirmed finds , but none so close to home			0
most are much bigger than the @entity3 , and many are as big as @entity233			0
the challenge astronomers now face is to detect and characterise a planet of mass comparable to the @entity3 that is orbiting in the habitable zone around another star			2
travel to the stars is the stuff of science fiction , but in the case of @entity5 it might not be out of the question , according to professor @entity119			0
he said : ' using our current technology , the kind of space missions being sent to @entity253 and planets in our own solar system , it would require 40,000 years to get to @entity5			1
that 's not really an option			0
' i think if a potentially habitable planet is found orbiting @entity5 or b you might see a ground - swell of excitement and a look at new kinds of propulsion technologies , leading to a mission to send an unmanned probe there in the period of a lifetime			1
' there have been design studies on the time scale of decades			0
they remain speculative and far - fetched , but it 's not impossible			0

newly found world orbits @entity5 , 4.3 light years from our @entity27
it is the lightest exoplanet yet found orbiting a @entity27 - like star
it is thought to be too hot for life , and there is likely no water present
but presence suggests there may be other planets within the same system
