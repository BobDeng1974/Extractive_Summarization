@entity0 and @entity1 are two of the most popular holiday destinations for @entity5 tourists but many of them can not pinpoint the @entity8 islands on a map , according to new research			1
a holiday price comparison website compiled a list of the 20 most - visited resorts and asked people who had recently returned from a summer break to mark the holiday hot spots on a map			1
a huge 68.5 per cent of the 3,000 holidaymakers questioned by @entity19 were unable to pinpoint the country for all 20 of the resorts			1
party island : 12 per cent of people thought @entity0 , part of the @entity25 , was a separate country turning @entity26 : ten per cent of people thought @entity29 ’s capital @entity30 was in @entity26 @entity1 in the @entity31 fared the worst with nearly a fifth of people ( 19 per cent ) placing it on the map incorrectly			1
this was followed by @entity36 , @entity37 ( 18 per cent ) , @entity38 , @entity39 ( 16 per cent ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ( 16 per cent ) and @entity42 in the @entity43 ( 15 per cent )			1
ten per cent of people thought @entity29 ’s capital @entity30 was in @entity26 while 12 per cent thought @entity0 , which is part of the @entity25 , was a separate country			1
meanwhile , six per cent of people thought @entity42 was in @entity47 and five per cent thought it was possible to drive from @entity49 to @entity50 , not realising that they would have to navigate across the @entity51			1
@entity1 is a popular destination for @entity5 tourists but nearly a fifth placed it on the map incorrectly 1			1

@entity42 ( @entity43 ) embarrassingly for parents , children fared better than adults when it came to naming all 20 countries			2
nearly six in ten ( 58 per cent ) of those aged seven to 15 admitted to ignoring where the country of their most recent holiday featured on an atlas and less than a third ( 31 per cent ) were able to accurately locate all 20 countries			1
of the 16 - 25 year olds , 39 per cent accurately located all 20 countries however , only 24 per cent of people aged between 26 and 40 were able to replicate that feat. wrong continent : six per cent of people thought the @entity43 island of @entity42 was in @entity47 flooding the engine : the five per cent of people who thought it was possible to drive from @entity49 to @entity50 ( pictured ) would come unstuck when they encountered the @entity51 @entity100 , @entity102 's @entity101 commented : ‘ we 're a nation of boomerang holidaymakers - we tend to return to the same holiday spots from one year to another			1
' so although we holiday abroad the most frequently , we 're actually one of the least well - travelled bunch when it comes to the breadth of countries we 've visited , with the average @entity112 visiting only six different countries in their lifetime			0
‘ although there is still a strong demand for the typical adolescent booze - fuelled getaways , more and more are opting to travel to long - haul destinations such as @entity29 and @entity119 and see the world before settling down and getting a job			2
‘ these younger travellers are seeing more of the world and developing a sounder geographical knowledge than that of their parents and younger siblings			2

many travellers failed to pinpoint resorts in @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity70
ten per cent of people thought @entity29 ’s capital @entity30 was in @entity26
others thought @entity0 was a separate country or that @entity42 was in @entity47
some even *believed* it was possible to drive from @entity49 to @entity50
