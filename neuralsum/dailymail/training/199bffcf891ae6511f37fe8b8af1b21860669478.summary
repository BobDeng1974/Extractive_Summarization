it is a charming image that might well tempt a traveller to visit			0
it ’s just a pity that @entity2 used a picture of @entity4 , in @entity5 , to advertise flights to the city of @entity4 ... in @entity8			1
while the northern metropolis boasts many great attractions , @entity4 , some 200 miles away in @entity11 , is n’t one of them			1
the airline used an image of @entity4 in @entity11 , @entity5 , to advertise a getaway in @entity4 , @entity8 so tourists who bought tickets based on the advert – emailed to the airline ’s customers alongside promotions for @entity23 and @entity24 – might have been a little disappointed when they reached their destination			1
the case of mistaken identity was spotted by @entity2 customer @entity28 , 48			2
he said : ‘ at first i thought , “ where ’s that ? ”			0
i was thinking it might be somewhere in @entity31 or @entity8 that i had n’t visited yet			2
‘ then i thought , “ that ’s @entity4 ”			2
i double - checked on the internet and there it was , the very same picture , in @entity11 , @entity5			1
’ he pointed out that it would be easier to visit the castle from @entity40 , near @entity41 , than from the city of @entity4			1
off base : the airline has apologised for the ' silly mistake ' and reassured customers pilots had ' no trouble ' locating @entity49 the city of @entity4 in @entity8 is some 200 miles away ( pictured )			1
the blunder was pointed out by baffled customers mr @entity28 , the director of a company that makes match programmes for @entity55 , added : ‘ it ’s one of those things that everyone worries about – that companies have a very @entity41 - based , @entity61 - based view of our country			0
‘ so when our national carrier does n’t even know where @entity4 is , it makes you worry			2
i know that @entity4 has a great deal to offer , but not that particular castle			0
’ in fact , the castle ’s name has nothing to do with the city of @entity4 , although it is linked to @entity4 village , which is near @entity11			1
the word leeds , in this case , derives from esledes – an old @entity81 word meaning slope or hillside			0
there has been a castle on the site since 1119			0
@entity2 owned up to the error last night			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we ’re sorry for the silly mistake			0
fortunately our pilots have no trouble at all recognising @entity4			1

@entity2 advertised a getaway to the city with image of @entity4
the *landmark* in @entity11 , @entity5 , is some 200 miles away from @entity8 city
airline apologised and reassured ' pilots have no trouble ' getting to @entity4
