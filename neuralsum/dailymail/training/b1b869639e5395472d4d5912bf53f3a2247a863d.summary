@entity0 is discussing his journey from being @entity3 ’s youngest ever player to the brink of a second cup semi-final with @entity6 when he reveals he would like to say sorry to @entity7			1
having been handed his @entity9 debut by @entity10 aged 16 years and 191 days , sooner than @entity11 or @entity12 , @entity0 left @entity13 at 20 , exasperated with reserve football and team - mates who laughed after losses			1
there was a contract offer from @entity3 but @entity0 failed to put pen to paper			1
two years on he has scored at @entity25 , been part of a side to beat @entity24 , and made more than 100 senior appearances			2
tv : highlights on @entity34 , @entity35 from 11.05pm			2
referee : @entity37 ‘ it was an easy decision for me really , ’ he says			2
' when @entity7 offered me the contract i did n’t say , “ no thanks ” , ’ explains @entity0			1
‘ it had to be signed by a certain date and i just did n’t sign it			2
‘ because he ’d been so good to me i do regret a little bit not going in and saying , “ listen , i ’m going to move on			2
” if i came across him now i ’d definitely apologise for that			2
’ it is six seasons since @entity7 sent @entity0 on for the final 12 minutes of a top - flight fixture against @entity51 , then started the schoolboy a week later at @entity53			1
‘ he hugged me when i came off , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ he ’s a top fella – i have n’t got a bad word to say about him			0
’ the propensity for making bold career decisions is a trait that unites the pair			2
the player left @entity3 to gain regular first - team football lower down the leagues , initially with @entity64 ; the manager elected to re-start his career abroad with @entity67 following his chastening spell at @entity69			1
‘ he ’ll probably learn another language and take his family , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ if he does come back to @entity73 there will definitely be a job for him			0
’ @entity0 celebrates scoring for @entity6 in their @entity76 semi-final against @entity77 at @entity25 in april @entity0 stepped into @entity78 eager to get meaningful action after growing disillusioned with youth football			1
he played four senior games in 2008 - 09 but only nine more in the next two seasons , in competition with @entity84			2
predominantly , he stretched his legs in under 21 matches			0
for @entity0 , that was not a means to push on			1
‘ i was going into reserve games and getting beat and was gutted , ’ he says			0
‘ i was looking round and there were other lads laughing saying , “ shall we go for food , or go out for a bit ? ” i do n’t want to do that after losing a game of football			0
it just shows it means nothing to them			0
‘ then i would be around the first team and one player has another by the scruff of the neck because they ’ve got a draw instead of a win			2
‘ i played reserve football from 14 up to 19 and it just got boring			0
if a first - team player was injured he would come down and would n’t take it seriously			2
it just was n’t for me			0
’ he went on loan to @entity114 for the first half of the 2011 - 12 campaign			0
the 22 - year - old feels her owes former @entity3 boss @entity7 for the way he departed the club ‘ the loan system is brilliant – it helped me massively			1
there are no kids – if you ’re good enough you ’re old enough			0
and if you ’re old enough you ’re ready for a b * * * * * ing. ’ intensity is a difficult thing to manufacture when the consequences of victory or defeat remain fairly unsubstantiated – youth football ’s eternal problem perhaps			0
@entity0 did gain a real sense of competition on international duty , captaining @entity136 at the @entity137 of 2009			1
he played alongside @entity138 and against @entity139 , who scored in a 4 - 0 victory for eventual champions @entity141			0
‘ there have definitely been a few i ’ve played against who ’ve kicked on , ’ is @entity0 ’s understated appraisal on the last man to score a winning goal in a @entity147 final			1
‘ @entity138 is certainly one of the best i ’ve played with , ’ he adds			0
‘ when we used to go away at 16 , you did n’t really know what gym was			2
he would always be in there working his socks off			0
’ hard work is a defining principle of @entity158 ’s @entity6 and could prove the determining factor in their ambitions of toppling @entity162 in tuesday ’s @entity164 quarter - final			1
this season ’s other @entity9 upstarts , @entity165 , have already been upset by @entity158 ’s side in this competition – on penalties in round two – and @entity0 believes @entity31 in full voice can provide the setting for another scalp			1
@entity0 talks to @entity175 's @entity174 at @entity6 's training ground ‘ it ’s a loving football city and they really want us to do well			1
it ’s only what they deserve			0
’ @entity0 has been scouting @entity162 since the draw was made six weeks ago			1
‘ you watch them closer and try to see weaknesses			0
there have n’t been many			0
for us to beat them it will be difficult but we will be going into the game to win			0
’ @entity192 ’s side have n’t won in five , losing their last four and @entity0 can not resist			1
' when they heard they were playing us in the cup they started getting beat – whether they ’re a bit nervous about @entity6 i ‘ m not sure			1
’ @entity162 were one of @entity78 ’s big beasts back in 2011 before earning consecutive promotions and re-establishing themselves in the @entity9			1
it is a progression @entity0 draws inspiration from			1
‘ that ’s where we want to be			0
everyone knows @entity6 do n’t belong in this league but it is the reality			1
we ’re doing our best to get out of it			0
there is no better way than to play against the big teams and see how far off you are			0
’ @entity6 reached the @entity76 semi-final last season after knocking out two @entity9 teams			1
@entity0 scored the opening goal in a thrilling match against @entity77 at @entity25 , eventually succumbing 5 - 3			1
‘ it makes you want to get there every year , ’ he says of the occasion			0
it was a career highlight , alongside victory over @entity227 ’s @entity24 in the same competition in january 2013 while at @entity64			0
despite his @entity3 connection , @entity0 is a @entity24 fan and was at the 2005 @entity164 at the @entity230 that @entity231 won 3 - 2			1
ask for his preference between going one better with @entity6 or going up into the @entity137 , he responds instantly			2
‘ definitely i ’d rather have promotion all day			0
that ’s easy , ’ he says			0
@entity0 has a habit of making tricky choices look simple			1
one @entity238 fan will on tuesday win the £ 250,000 @entity239 for their club to spend on players in january			2
watch the draw on @entity243 at noon .			0
