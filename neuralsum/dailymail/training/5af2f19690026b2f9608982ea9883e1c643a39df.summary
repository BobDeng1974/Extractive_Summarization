by @entity0 it is a hard - fought game where players are taught not to shirk a tackle			2
but @entity5 ’s ruling body has been accused of going soft by trying to remove the competitive edge of the sport for children			1
it wants schools and clubs to switch players between sides at half - time to make games less one - sided and to ban trophies from tournaments for the under 11 ’s in order to stop disillusioned youngsters giving up			1
however attempts to introduce a more level playing field have backfired with one former @entity25 international pulling his club out of mini-rugby competitions			1
@entity5 ¿ s ruling body has been accused of going soft by trying to remove the competitive edge of the sport for children			1
file picture @entity31 , who was part of the @entity25 ’s 1992 @entity34 winning side , said : ‘ @entity35 is a lesson in life			1
‘ nobody wants to see a young side get panned but if one team wins by 30 points you have to say “ congratulations ” and the other team goes off to lick its wounds and ask what went wrong			0
’ on sunday mornings tens of thousands of youngsters play mini-rugby , using a smaller ball and playing on a smaller pitch			2
but the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) is concerned at the number of children who drop out in their teens instead of graduating to the adult game			2
try hard : @entity31 , who played for @entity56 and @entity57 , blasted the guidelines and said : ' you can ¿ t tell an eight - year - old that the result doesn ¿ t matter ' it therefore is urging clubs to concentrate on playing skills and enjoying being on the field rather than the result			0
this in mind @entity35 , one of @entity51 ’s constituent bodies , has sent out new rules for a forthcoming min - club festival			0
rival coaches have been told they must consult on the levels of their teams before a match and switch players at half - time if the score is too one - sided			0
clubs have been warned they will be disciplined if they ignore the new guidelines			0
but two clubs - @entity85 , from @entity87 , and @entity88 , from south - west @entity84 , are so incensed they have pulled out of the tournament			0
mr @entity31 , who played for @entity56 and @entity57 , said : ‘ i get the full gamut of trying to encourage children to play but you ca n’t tell an eight - year - old that the result does n’t matter			0
’ however @entity51 development director @entity96 says it is more important to keep the children interested than meet the adult ’s needs			0
he said : ‘ this is not about denying children competitive rugby			2
@entity35 is a competitive team sport and always will be and as a father myself i know how competitive children are			1
‘ but we must evolve a player - centred game which is enjoyable and allows young people to develop			1
‘ that is our @entity112 programme , where the core skills are brought to the fore while maintaining the integrity of the sport as a game for all shapes and sizes			1

sport chiefs want schools to remove some competitive *aspects* of game
they say it will stop youngsters *turning* away from the sport
but a former @entity25 player has *derided* the plans
