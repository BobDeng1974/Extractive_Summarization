a giant crocodile appeared to have bitten off more than it could chew when it clamped its jaws around the trunk of an elephant			1
these incredible photographs captured the moment the four meter reptile was lifted almost clear out of the water as the panicked bull elephant attempted to free himself from its jaws			1
the large mammal had been enjoying an afternoon bath with the rest of the herd at a watering hole in the @entity16 game reserve in @entity17			1
that 's got to hurt ! a crocodile is almost lifted clean out of the water after it clamps its jaws round a bull elephant 's trunk but as it tried to leave the water , an enormous crocodile latched onto the animal 's trunk with its sharp jaws			1
tourists saw the terrified elephant rear up on its hind legs and trumpet loudly in fear and pain as it tried to free its trunk			2
the hungry crocodile was even dragged out of the water and into the air as the two animals tussled but it stubbornly refused to let go			2
eventually the bull struck the reptile with his knee and stabbed with his tusks to escape its jaws before making a very quick get away			1
the elephant had been walking back up the bank after an afternoon swim at the watering hole when the enormous crocodile latched on panicking , the elephant tries to pull his trunk out of its jaws but the crocodile refuses to let go at @entity53 , in @entity17 @entity54 , a 31 - year - old fitness marketer , from @entity57 @entity56 , caught the fierce fight on camera during a trip to the game reserve in december			1
@entity54 said : ' we had been sitting in our truck on the river bank			0
suddenly , about 300 yards upstream we heard loud and frantic trumpeting from an older bull elephant			2
' it was initially hard to make out why , but when he arched his trunk and reared up on his hind legs , it quickly became clear that a crocodile had latched on to his trunk			1
' the elephant reared up and down , taking the croc with him as if he was waving around a toy			0
' eventually , when the croc would n't loosen his grip , the elephant slammed him on the ground and put his knee , and the full weight of his body , on to the croc and then jabbed it with his tusks			2
trumpeting in pain and fear , the bull elephant yanks back it 's trunk and the four - metre crocodile comes with it eventually , the elephant is able to free himself and makes a quick getaway trampling over the crocodile which also survived ' this finally got the croc to relent and the elephant ran up the hill of the bank faster than i thought possible for an animal that big			1
' i was in awe			0
it was hard to say anything other than this is insane			0
' i 've never seen anything like it , and it appeared that neither had our guide , tracker or any of the staff and @entity113 - it was pretty unique			0
' i remember our guide yelling , ' cameras ! cameras ! ' as if this was a once in a lifetime opportunity , he was not wrong			0
' although the elephant sustained injuries to his trunk , rangers expect him to make a full recovery			0
the crocodile may have suffered more serious wounds .			0
