a judge has recommended a six - month suspension for a @entity3 attorney who posted doctored photos on her firm 's website that show her with high - profile people such as president @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
in an 18 - page decision this month , judge @entity11 said @entity13 failed to remove the images after a @entity15 warning that they were false advertising ; disregarded the disciplinary process and responded to the charges with a 16 - page soliloquy that had little or nothing to do with the case			1
the @entity24 @entity23 will decide on the recommendation			2
one of the pictures above she posted on her firm 's website , with @entity37 , @entity9 and @entity38 the photo that @entity13 posted online looks very like this one taken in october 2007 but instead of @entity41 sitting at the front row fashion show it is @entity43 the attorney says she was photographed with ' talented and successful people ' at charity and political events and provided a photo link			1
state bar court judge @entity49 says the photos posted on @entity13 's law practice website ' were created by taking original celebrity photos and then overlaying ( @entity54 's ) image in order to make it appear as though ( @entity13 ) was in the presence of that celebrity '			1
in some of the photos , @entity13 even uses the same picture of herself			2
' friends ' in high places : the images were still up on @entity13 's website as of today			1
pictured above with actress @entity65 @entity54 put this photo online of her posing with actor @entity10 punishment : the @entity24 bar association is recommending that @entity54 's law license be suspended for six months , and that she be put on probation for three years			1
pictured above with @entity72 when confronted about the pictures two years ago , @entity54 did n't even trouble herself to take the photos down from the site			1
according to her website , @entity13 practices deals in business , real estate , foreclosure , insurance , employment and personal injury litigation they still appeared there today , under a tab titled ' publicity '			2
in fact , @entity11 says @entity54 responded to the charges in a ' 16 - page soliloquy with little to no rational connection to the charges at hand '			1
in one particularly strange excerpt , @entity54 goes on a tangent about @entity97 's performance in the 2010 ballet - drama ' @entity99 ' the passage reads : ' also , with regard to false statements and misleading advertisement , none other than @entity97 comes to mind			1
the online media extensively covers the controversy surrounding @entity97 's performance in the film @entity99			1
' the ballet dancer who performed in the @entity99 , @entity111 , has come forward to revel [ sic ] a ' cover - up ' and says that @entity97 's head was superimposed on to @entity111 's body , and that @entity97 lied			1
' she also includes an email from president @entity8 in the response , in which he allegedly asks her to donate to the @entity121 party			2
according to the @entity122 , @entity54 graduated from @entity124 â€™s @entity123			1
she was admitted to the @entity15 in 2004			0
a selection of the photos on the website - they are still online for the public to view legends : after being confronted about the images two years ago , @entity54 refused to take the photos down			1
pictured above with deceased actor @entity133 politicians : she wrote a 16 - page response to the allegations in which she goes off on several strange tangents , including one passage about @entity141 ' acting in the 2010 film @entity99			0
pictured above with president @entity8 final say : the decision whether to suspend @entity54 's law license is up to the @entity24 @entity23			1
pictured above with @entity146 thanks to software editing programs it is easier than ever to pretend you are with someone you have n't met or visiting a place you have not traveled to			0
there are instructions across the internet on how to fake a photo with a celebrity such as this one by @entity157			2
find an image with a celebrity that is not likely to have been seen all over the internet and people will recognise - a casual photo is best			2
make sure it 's high resolution and then save it to your computer			2
choose a photo of yourself			0
try to find an image that will blend well with the celebrity picture you have selected - eg if there is a spotlight coming from the right on your celebrity image , choose a photo of yourself where there is a strong light source on the right			0
open both photos in the editing program of your choice			0
photoshop is popular but you can also find free online editors that work just as well			0
remove the background from your photo			0
use the @entity192 or @entity193 to cut yourself out of your picture then use a remove brush to ' erase ' the background			0
if the background is a light white and gray checked background , this means that you are removing any background which will make it lay on top of the second photo better			0
drag the newly - cut image of yourself onto the celebrity picture			0
to make sure the image does not look too obviously faked there are certain tweaks that can be made			0
use the eraser tool to get rid of extraneous pieces of background that came along with the image of yourself			0
look at height difference - you made need to tinker with your size next to the celebrity so you are not too tall or small - ie shrink or enlarge the image of yourself			0
you may also need to adjust the lighting or contrast of the photo			0

@entity122 says @entity54 photoshopped herself into more than 50 pictures with celebrities
judge recommended @entity54 's law license be suspended for six months
the attorney denies they are fake and says she was photographed with ' talented and successful people ' at charity and political events
