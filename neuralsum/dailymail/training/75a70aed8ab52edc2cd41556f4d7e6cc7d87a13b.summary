@entity3 play @entity4 in the @entity8 final at @entity19 on sunday hoping to get their own back click here to check out @entity9 ' work on @entity10 click here to follow @entity10 on twitter click here to check out @entity11 's work on the @entity12 click here to follow @entity31 on twitter feeling confident ? @entity33 : extremely			1
after the catastrophe that was @entity36 we owe @entity4 massively			1
combine that with the fact that they played in @entity39 on thursday night in a huge match while we have had over a week off , and @entity42 ’s ban aside , we could n’t really ask for much more going into the game			0
@entity44 : yeah , weirdly i 'm very confident , perhaps because i ca n't bring myself to contemplate defeat			0
@entity47 ( left ) of @entity3 and @entity4 's @entity48 ( right ) will hope to inspire their team to a win there ’s plenty of history between the two teams – what is it that make this rivalry intense ? @entity33 : its very tricky to put a finger on exactly why the rivalry is so venomous			1
from their perspective i assume it ’s the fact that they could n’t beat us for years even when they had a superior team			0
or the fact that they have n’t won a league match at @entity72 for 25 years			0
or the fact that we knocked them out of the @entity76 by becoming the first @entity78 club to win it			0
for us i think its more to do with the hatred we receive from them			0
@entity44 : i hate @entity83 for who they are but i hate @entity3 for what they are – a morally bankrupt , jammy , despicable club , with some of the most dislikable personnel in the game			2
the majority of their fans are in the same vein			0
our terrible record against them , plus the @entity76 fiasco , also contributes to the recent bad feeling but the rivalry dates back decades			2
@entity4 fans generally do n't have fun at @entity72 , and that may be a reason for the rivalry stewards remove a fan from the pitch during an @entity108 quarter - final replay at @entity109 spurs were underdogs in the 2008 final but beat @entity3 2 - 1 , will lightning strike twice ? @entity33 : the @entity3 team of 2008 were not a team of winners			1
it had all the hallmarks of an @entity118 team , who i believe has just taken his side to second in the @entity123			0
under @entity118 we came out second best in the @entity8 , second in the @entity126 and second in the @entity76			2
and we were knocked out of the @entity108 by @entity127			0
you say they were underdogs but i do n’t think too many @entity3 fans were surprised that @entity118 managed to steer us to defeat that day			1
@entity44 : yeah , we 'd love a 2 - 1 this season , and i think we 're more closely matched now than then			1
@entity4 player after beating @entity3 to lift the @entity8 in 2008 what are your memories of that day ? @entity33 : the overriding memory of the day is the pain and torture as @entity138 got to the ball ahead of @entity140 right in front of us			1
and then being soaking wet at @entity19 listening to endless renditions of ' oh when the @entity110 ' ... it was agony but it @entity4 deserved it			1
it takes huge character to come back from a goal down in a cup final			2
@entity44 : i had a ticket but in the corporate seats at @entity19			2
there were more @entity3 fans and neutrals around me than @entity110 fans but it was stunning looking across at the @entity110 end and the noise was incredible			2
i ca n't remember much of the game but @entity163 's cool penalty obviously stands out and i went crazy when @entity138 scored			0
a couple of the @entity3 fans shook my hand at the final whistle , which was a touch			1
@entity138 nods home the winner - getting to the ball before goalkeeper @entity140 @entity163 netted a cool penalty during the 2 - 1 victory at @entity172 which of your players will make the difference this time around ? @entity33 : i think the only bright spot when @entity4 destroyed us on @entity36 was the performance of @entity47			1
he seemed to really understand the rivalry and how desperate @entity3 fans were to get something from the game			1
if he plays to a similar level and those around him raise their game , i think that he could be too much for @entity110 to deal with			0
@entity44 : @entity188 and @entity48 are the obvious ones but i 've got a good feeling about @entity191 too			0
@entity188 will be looking to make the difference against @entity3 at @entity19 this weekend that 5 - 3 game is still fresh in the memory – how will that affect this game ? @entity33 : i think it will affect the game positively for everybody			1
it will definitely inspire @entity4 , they scored five goals against us			2
however , i also think it will inspire @entity3			2
there is n’t a better way to get back at a team to whom you feel you owe one , by beating them at a final at @entity19			1
@entity44 : on the one hand , it will give @entity110 belief they can outplay and beat @entity3 , which is crucial			1
on the other , it will make the @entity3 players ( who must be prioritising the @entity126 and @entity76 ) extra motivated to exact revenge			2
so , it could be beneficial for both teams			0
@entity3 players look dejected after losing 5 - 3 to @entity4 at @entity109 on @entity36 and what of @entity42 's ban ? @entity33 : huge			1
but i think that @entity221 will opt for @entity222			0
now i concede that @entity222 does n’t have the presence of @entity42 but he is a wonderful player , capable of chipping @entity224 in the @entity225 or scoring in the @entity108 final against @entity227			0
i have full faith in him			0
@entity44 : he 's a good player and hopefully @entity48 can exploit the space created by his absence			0
but it should n't make too much difference			0
if @entity3 – one of the richest clubs in the world , who routinely buy players to stop them joining rivals – ca n't cope without one midfielder , then their squad is n't nearly as strong as everyone thinks			2
@entity42 was sent off against @entity244 and will miss the final - his absence is a huge loss for @entity3 generally , @entity110 do n't beat @entity3 that often , do they ? @entity33 : well over the course of my lifetime generally not			1
however , we have never beaten them in a cup final which is slightly worrying			0
third time lucky i hope			0
@entity44 : no but i 'm happy with @entity110 ' record against @entity3 in cup finals			2
@entity4 players celebrate with the @entity108 after beating @entity3 2 - 1 in 1967 what are your plans on the day of the game ? @entity33 : a pint of @entity263 around @entity264 to ease the nerves before @entity266 - lining it into @entity19			1
there is n’t a better feeling in football			0
@entity44 : i have n't got a ticket ( yet ) so i 'm going to watch at home with some mates and try to write a few articles , then go out to celebrate our victory afterwards			0
there 's no better feeling in football than making your way to @entity19 on cup final day finally , your predictions , please			1
@entity33 : 3 - 1 @entity3			1
@entity44 : there 's been lots of goals when we 've played @entity3 this season , so i 'll go 3 - 2 @entity110 after extra time .			1
