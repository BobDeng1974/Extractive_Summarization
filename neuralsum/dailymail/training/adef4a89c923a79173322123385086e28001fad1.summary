new @entity2 signing @entity0 spoke to the club 's official website after moving to @entity5 from @entity6 in a £ 16million deal on monday			1
@entity0 , welcome to @entity2			1
how do you feel to have signed for the club ? i 'm very happy			2
we 've been talking about coming here and i 'm happy to be here			2
done deal : @entity2 signing @entity0 poses with the shirt after switching to @entity5 in a £ 16million deal what attracted you to the challenge here at @entity2 ? @entity2 are one of the best teams here in @entity22			1
the football is very good here			0
it 's a great team with young players , and that 's why i came here			0
you 've received an incredible reception from the fans here already			0
how has that made you feel ? i did n't expect it because i 've always been playing against @entity2			2
whenever i played against @entity2 , the fans were n't nice with me but that 's normal - it 's football ! now that i play for @entity2 , i can see the expectation in people			1
they 're very happy and that makes me very happy at the same time			0
unexpected : @entity0 admitted @entity2 fans were n't nice with him during his time playing for @entity42 you 've previously described playing at @entity5 as a ' beautiful experience ' to @entity45			1
did you enjoy playing at @entity5 as an opposing player ? no - but when i play with this team [ at @entity5 ] , it 's going to be nice for sure			1
to play here for @entity2 excites me , but if you 're an opponent it 's difficult			2
for someone still so young , you have a lot of experience - can you use that to help what is a young team here at @entity2 ? i maybe have a little bit more experience than other players - if i can help them , i 'm happy to help them			1
pen to paper : @entity63 international @entity0 has signed a three - year deal with the @entity65 worth £ 125,000 - a - week @entity2 are back in the @entity66 after five years out , and you have got great memories of the competition ; you were @entity69 's youngest ever goalscorer in the tournament and you also won it with them in 2010			1
are those experiences something you can bring to @entity2 to help in the @entity66 this season ? i always start a competition wanting to win it			0
i want to win another @entity66 for sure , because the @entity66 was n't all mine , i was in a team			0
i want to take this team to the @entity66			0
you have been away from @entity22 football for around 18 months - how do you feel about coming back ? i 'm happy to be back because i left @entity22 and it was a mistake			1
i wanted to go to @entity63 but i realised it was a mistake			2
regret : @entity0 admits it was a mistake to leave @entity22 when he left @entity42 for @entity6 in january 2013 do you feel @entity22 football suits you better ? @entity22 football is generally better			1
we know you are going to take the @entity87 for @entity2			0
can you explain the significance of that shirt ? when i first played three or four games with @entity69 , when i was young , i had @entity92 because the numbers for young players were from @entity95 to @entity96			0
i took @entity92 because i was joking that four plus five is nine - and i scored in all four games			0
it brings me luck and that 's why i 've always kept @entity87			0
this deal has moved very quickly over the last few days , so has it sunk in yet that you are a @entity2 player ? no. when i meet the team , start training with them and start my first game , i will realise			2
for now , i have just seen the city			0
superstition : @entity0 insists wearing the no 45 shirt brings him luck on the pitch how much are you looking forward to meeting your new teammates ? i am going to meet them soon and i 'm excited			1
@entity2 are in action tonight against your former club , @entity42 - are you going to attend the game ? i 'm going to be watching the game			1
i would love to play but i ca n't , so i 'll support them from the stand			0
finally , what are your ambitions here at @entity2 ? what do you hope to achieve ? as much as i can			0
