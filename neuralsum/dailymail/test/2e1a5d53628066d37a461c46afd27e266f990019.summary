@entity0 and his fellow top gear presenters were just about to renew their lucrative contacts for three more years but they were scrapped when the star punched the show 's producer			1
@entity8 , 52 , revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three - year deal by ordering a rare £ 200,000 @entity10 before @entity0 's sacking after an infamous ' fracas ' with producer @entity13			1
may says he had ordered the last ever @entity18 - in bright orange - while the ' draft version ' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk ' with only a few details to resolve '			1
but after @entity0 punched @entity13 in a rage over a hot meal , the offer was taken off the table			1
but @entity0 , 55 , was sensationally sacked by the @entity37 last month and @entity38 , 45 , joined may in confirming he will not return to @entity39 this week			2
writing in a column for the @entity41 , may said : ' there we were , all three of us , on the brink of a new three - year contract to make @entity39 , after which we would definitely chuck it in with dignity and hand the reins to a new generation , assuming we were still alive ' there were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff , but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk			1
' this was a great privilege and a once - in - a - lifetime event ; an invitation to continue presenting the world 's biggest tv show for – let 's not be shy – a handsome salary			1
' the three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting ' with dignity ' until @entity0 was sensationally sacked after punching show producer @entity13 ( pictured ) on the future , he remained vague , suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions			1
now , may admits ordering a brand new @entity10 is a ' strange ' thing for an unemployed person to do , but insists he has no regrets , describing the purchase as a once - in - lifetime opportunity			1
he acknowledged the supercar was an extravagant purchase at £ 208,090 but that ' it was better than money in the bank '			0
meanwhile , @entity0 was seen talking himself out of a parking ticket for his bright green @entity82 yesterday after leaving it parked on yellow lines in @entity85			2
elsewhere , @entity38 told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be ' exciting ' for the three men , but refused to speculate further on the future of @entity39			0
he said : ' everybody knows what 's happened			0
that 's all been in the news			0
the future , nobody knows yet do they ? ' and i can not and wo n't speculate further than that			0
so do n't know , let 's see			0
it 'll be exciting whatever			0
' there is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by @entity105 , @entity106 or another @entity108 broadcaster			0
producer @entity109 had his lip split by @entity0 in the march 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries			2
police investigated the attack but @entity13 told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would ' not be pursuing the matter any further			0
' @entity8 ( right ) was vague on the future for the trio , hinting that they may be reunited on screen			2

@entity8 reveals he celebrated prematurely by ordering £ 200,000 @entity10
lucrative contract was in a draft form with only a few details to resolve
but offer was taken away after @entity0 's infamous ' fracas ' with producer
may said trio planned to continue making show before leaving ' with dignity '
