a drive to get more prisoners working in prison is branded a failure today after figures show there has barely been an increase in four years			1
the proportion of inmates working in public sector prisons has risen by just one per cent since the coalition was formed			1
and in 30 prisons the figure has fallen , leading @entity13 to condemn the @entity14 ' get tough message on life in jail as ' just a load of hot air '			1
ministers pledged to get more prisoners working , and not sitting idle in their cells			2
but there the proportion of inmates working has risen by 1 per cent since 2010 since 2010 the government has repeatedly vowed to turn prisons into ' places of hard work and industry '			1
but new figures released in @entity32 show that in 2013 - 14 just 14 per cent of prisoners were working , up from 13 per cent in 2010 - 11			1
in 2010 the @entity34 declared : ' prisons will become places of hard work and industry , instead of enforced idleness			1
' hard work for offenders is at the heart of our plans to make punishments more rigorous			1
' prisons should not allow offenders to simply mark their time in a purposeless fashion			2
' rather , prisons should be seen as places where increasing numbers of prisoners are engaged in challenging and meaningful work			1
' @entity54 justice secretary @entity53 said in 20102 : ' saving money does not have to mean less work in prison and less training for offenders			0
' we will continue to increase the hours prisoners spend in work and training			0
' last year @entity63 declared : ' we are putting more and more offenders like him to work in prison every year : making sure he does n't lie idle in his bed			1
' the proportion of prisoners working was lower after four years in 30 prisons , including @entity70 , down from 38 per cent to 25 per cent , @entity72 prison , down from 30 per cent to 19 per cent , and @entity73 , down from 13 per cent to 9 per cent			1
@entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity82 prison also falls			0
@entity13 's shadow justice secretary @entity83 said the promise to put more criminals to work was ' a load of hot air ' @entity13 's shadow justice secretary @entity83 said : ' yet again @entity89 fails to deliver and has broken a key promise			0
' so much for the rehabilitation revolution @entity89 's government promised			0
' four years ago we were told that criminals would be put to work while in jail , but this data we have uncovered shows it was just a load of hot air			2
' not only are prisons not working , nor are prisoners			0
instead of being put to work , or made to go on education and training courses , prisoners are still spending too much time behind bars idling away their days in their cells or prison landings			0
' he accused the government of closing down too many jails and laying off too many prison officers			0
' prisons have become overcrowded and violent as a result			0
none of this will help reduce re-offending , cut the number of innocent victims of crime or make our communities safer			0
' many work in workshops producing items for the outside world , while some help with the upkeep of the prison , cooking food and cleaning			0
justice minister @entity132 said : ' work in prisons is a key priority to ensure prisoners are engaged in real work whilst they are in custody			2
' it also gives them the opportunity to learn skills and a work ethic which can increase their chances of finding employment on release , a key element to reducing reoffending			0
' he boasted that the number of prisoners working in public sector prisons increased from around 8,600 in 2010 - 11 to around 9,900 in 2013 - 14			1
however the prison population has risen over this time , meaning the proportion has barely changed			2
mr @entity132 added : ' in that time , an additional four million hours have been worked in public prisons and in 2012 - 13 ( the most recent figure available ) a further 1,200 prisoners worked in commercial and industrial workshops in private sector prisons			1
' none of these figures include the significant numbers of prisoners who work in keeping prisons clean , maintenance or cooking and serving meals			2

ministers promised in 2010 : ' prisons will become places of hard work '
*deputy* *pm* @entity63 said he *wanted* fewer inmates ' lying idle in his bed '
but since 2010 the proportion in work has risen from 13 **%** to 14 **%**
in 30 public sector prisons the figures have fallen in four years
