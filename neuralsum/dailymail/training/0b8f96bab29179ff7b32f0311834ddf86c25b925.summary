by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham @entity1 : £ 30million			1
this is the fee being demanded for a 26 - year - old who was playing in @entity4 just three years ago			0
@entity5 are playing hardball in @entity8 ’s pursuit of their star player , but is he really worth that much money ? @entity11 went to @entity12 from @entity13 for £ 30m			1
@entity14 , the original one , went to @entity15 from @entity16 for £ 30m			0
@entity17 went from @entity18 to @entity19 for £ 30m			0
strength to strength : @entity8 are tracking @entity5 midfielder @entity1 , but may have to pay £ 30m £ 30m men : @entity19 and @entity12 respectively spent big on @entity17 and @entity11 at the time – the fees of course being relative to the economic climate when the transfers were made – these players were at the pinnacle of their respective positions			1
does @entity1 deserve to follow at such a high price ? well , yes , actually			1
i was handed the assignment of following @entity5 when they won promotion to the @entity33 back in 2012 and have bore witness to a player who has gasped the opportunity presented to him in the top flight and torn it to shreds			1
the truly remarkable thing is how the club managed to keep hold of him all this time			0
i once covered a @entity5 game when they visited @entity44 and @entity45 in january 2011 , on their way to winning promotion from @entity4			2
a certain @entity48 , 17 at the time , was almost on his way to @entity51 and would join them that summer , but @entity1 was also lighting up the league			2
jinking and weaving : @entity1 is set to become a real asset for @entity56 's @entity55 at the @entity57 pitch - side after the match , i asked then - manager @entity60 if he was confident he could realistically keep hold of @entity1 as well			1
he looked at me like it was the most ridiculous suggestion he had heard all season and insisted his star central midfielder was going nowhere			0
i did n’t believe him at the time , but somehow , for so long , they managed to keep @entity1 on the south coast			2
the player has undoubted technical ability which only the top percentile of professional footballers possess , but what @entity1 has developed over years of encouragement at @entity5 is a positivity in his play to run opposition players ragged			1
he is strongest through the middle , but roams freely on either flank , and plays with utter @entity78 his assist for @entity79 against @entity80 at @entity81 ’s last december as an example			2
@entity1 had broken free on the right inside the box and had just the on - rushing @entity85 to @entity86 a seemingly supernatural sensory perception he took one touch before cutting the ball back behind him to @entity79 , leaving the goalkeeper stranded , for a tap - in			1
he did it without even looking , so aware of his surroundings that he knew @entity79 was running in behind			2
true grit : former @entity5 boss @entity60 managed to keep hold of his star man for longer than expected redefining : @entity1 has reinvented the legendary @entity98 turn , the brainchild of @entity100 great @entity101 many players would claim to be able to play with equal strength on either foot , but very few actually can			1
@entity1 is one who actually can			2
he scores with his left foot , his right foot , from inside the area , outside the area , with neat finishes from tight angles to pile drivers from distance			0
@entity1 has reinvented the @entity113			0
it is a skill which has become so common it is used ineffectively by any average @entity115 in @entity117 games up and down the country every weekend			0
but @entity1 does a proper @entity113			0
one which leaves one or two defenders for dead , thus providing @entity5 with an extra man going on the attack			1
and he does this several times a game			0
following the big man ? @entity1 could move to @entity125 after @entity79 completed his deal at the weekend it is n’t flash , it ’s not showing off , it is expertly unlocking opposition sides			1
his ability to dribble past opposition players , to swerve and shimmy and shift the ball from right to left like it is magnetised to his feet is mesmeric			0
the goal he scored against @entity137 last november , when he slalomed past four players , carrying the ball into the box on the left before accurately finding the far right corner from the tightest angle , was one of the goals last season			0
@entity8 will only hope they can get the negotiations finished before the @entity57 starts , when @entity1 will have the opportunity to showcase his talents on the biggest stage of all			1
he is more than ready for the step up .			0

@entity1 is a genius at picking holes in defences
@entity5 *captain* could be a key man at the @entity57 in @entity158
@entity79 joined @entity8 at the weekend
