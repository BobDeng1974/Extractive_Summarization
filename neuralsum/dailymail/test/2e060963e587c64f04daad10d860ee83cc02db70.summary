just over 60 per cent of @entity0 believe global warming is taking place and nearly half blame humans for the change			1
but within the @entity0 , opinions on global warming vary wildly between states , local communities , and congressional districts			1
people in @entity11 , for instance , are far more worried about the warming planet than those in parts of the central @entity0			2
click on the interactive map below to find out which regions think global warming is happening now a new interactive map has revealed public opinion in all 50 states , 435 congressional districts and more than 3,000 counties			1
to create the map , researchers at @entity23 asked people if they believed global warming is happening and whether they were worried			1
they were also asked questions such as whether they would support research into renewable energies and what they think about carbon limits			0
nationally , 52 per cent of @entity0 are worried about global warming			1
but , as the results show , this national number glosses over the geographic diversity			0
concern about global warming ranges from an estimated low of 38 per cent in @entity37 , @entity38 , to a high of 74 per cent in @entity40 the results also identify significant variation within states , and one surprising result is @entity45			1
here , public concern about climate change ranges from a low of 39 per cent in @entity49 to a high of 61 per cent in @entity51			1
just over 60 per cent of @entity0 believe global warming is taking place and nearly half blame humans for the change			1
pictured are the percentages of people who are worried about climate change , divided by different counties concern about global warming ranges from an estimated low of 38 per cent in @entity37 , @entity38 ( pictured ) , to a high of 74 per cent in @entity40 the @entity61 experienced its hottest month of march since record - keeping began in 1880			1
there 's been no break from the globe 's record heat - the first three months of 2015 have all set new high temperature marks			0
last month 's average temperature soared to @entity68 ( 13.6 ° c ) , which is 1.5 ° f ( 0.85 ° c ) above the average for the 20th century			0
scientists warn that fossil fuel burning is pushing more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere , leading to increased temperatures , melting of polar ice and glaciers , and rising seas			0
the data , released last week by the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) takes into account global averages across land and sea surfaces			0
it follows earlier announcements from @entity0 government scientists that 2014 was the hottest year in modern history			0
' although a majority of people in every state think global warming is happening , this analysis makes it possible to see how much opinions differ within each state , ' said @entity96 of @entity97 , the lead author of the paper			2
' these differences are partly due to the fact that different groups often think differently about the issue			0
' for example , hispanics and @entity104 tend to be more worried about global warming than other racial or ethnic groups , which can be seen on the map in counties with more @entity111 residents			1
' @entity112 , @entity11 , @entity113 and @entity114 are the four states that are most worried by climate change			2
three are coloured in orange , which means that at least 50 per cent of the people in every county are concerned about climate change			1
the data used in is based on 12 surveys conducted between 2008 and 2013 by the @entity124			0
to validate the model , the research team conducted separate surveys in four states and two cities			0
they found the estimates were within three percentage points of the independent surveys at the state level and four percentage points at the city level			0
' most of the action to reduce carbon pollution and prepare for climate change impacts is happening at the state and local levels of @entity0 society , ' said @entity144 , a research scientist at the @entity145			1
' yet elected officials , the media , educators , and advocates currently know little about the levels of public and political will for climate action at these sub-national levels			0
@entity144 added that state and local surveys are costly and time - intensive , and as a result most public opinion polling is only done at the national level			2
in @entity45 , concern about climate change ranges from a low of 39 per cent in @entity49 to a high of 61 per cent in @entity51 ( pictured ) pictured are the number of adults who believe global warming is taking place			1
the results are divided by congressional district			0
the researchers say many @entity0 believe that even if it exists , global warming is not their problem ' this model for the first time reveals the full geographic diversity of public opinion in the @entity0 at these critical levels of decision making , ' he said			1
earlier this year , research by the same group the number of people in @entity0 who believe climate change is n't happening has risen to 23 percent , up seven percentage points since april 2013			1
the researchers also say many @entity0 believe that even if it exists , global warming is not their problem			2
' over years of research , we have consistently found that , on average , @entity0 view global warming as a threat distant in space and time – a risk that will affect faraway places , other species , or future generations more than people here and now , ' an earlier report by the group said			2
' people who prior said do n't know are increasingly saying they do n't believe it , ' said @entity144			0
he told @entity198 media coverage surrounding the release of the @entity201 report in september may be the explanation for the shift			0
while the report made a strong case for human - caused climate change , the majority of global media coverage focused on the question of whether there has been a ' pause ' in global warming			1
' media frames can be really important in shaping the way people interpret the news , ' he said			0
the findings divide @entity0 into six distinct subsets			0
sixteen percent are ' alarmed , ' sure global warming is happening and concerned about it			2
on the opposite end of the spectrum are the ' dismissive , ' who comprise about 15 per cent of the public and who almost all see global warming as a conspiracy theory or hoax			2
changing either of these two groups ' opinions about climate change is nearly impossible , the report found			2
this graph reveals the percentage of people in each state who support funding research into renewable energy sources			0
@entity239 , @entity113 and @entity240 are among the states with the highest levels of support just over 60 per cent of @entity0 believe global warming is taking place and nearly half blame humans for the change			1
but within the @entity0 , opinions on global warming vary wildly between states , local communities , and congressional districts			1
people in @entity11 , for instance , are far more worried about the warming planet than those in parts of the central @entity0			0

the map , created by @entity23 , reveals public opinion in all 50 states , 435 districts and 3,000 counties
overall , just over 60 per cent of @entity0 believe global warming is taking place and nearly half blame humans
climate change concern ranges from 38 per cent in @entity37 , @entity38 , to 74 per cent in @entity40
