when firefighters in @entity2 were called out to tackle a car blaze , nothing seemed out of the ordinary			1
but the precarious positioning of the vehicle , at the top of a hill , soon caused problems			0
as the firemen blasted the car with water , the power from their hoses sent it rolling down the road while still on fire			1
nothing appears to be out of the ordinary when firefighters arrive to put out the flames engulfing the car one firefighter can be seen desperately trying to grab hold of the car by leaning inside the burning vehicle to grab the steering wheel			2
but he soon has to draw back as the car picks up speed and starts to roll down to the residential road			1
luckily there is no oncoming traffic as the vehicle loses control and the flames are whipped up by the wind			0
the power from the firefighters ' water hoses appears to set the car in motion and send it rolling down the hill despite the best efforts of a firefighter he is unable to prevent the car from gathering pace and has to let it go as onlookers call out warnings , the car crashes into a barrier at the side of the road and fortunately does n't go through it - particularly as there is a drop on the other side			1
the footage then skips a few minutes to show how firefighters have reversed their truck down the road and are now battling the flames at the bottom of the hill			0
the footage was uploaded by local @entity59 and incredulous viewers soon started commenting			0
fortunately no traffic is coming the other way as the out - of - control car speeds down the hill on fire the footage cuts to show how firefighters had to reverse down the hill after the car crashes into a barrier a user called seijisawamura000 wrote : ' a flaming car going downhill because of firefighters trying to extinguish it and the people around camera did n't laugh at all ?
