by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 15 november 2013 for zookeepers , handing babies over to their mother can be stressful , especially when they are as important as two giant pandas			2
but @entity5 , @entity6 's most famous resident , shows her parenting experience in these photos as she cuddles and cleans her baby boy @entity10 - which means ' indescribably beautiful ' in @entity12			1
meanwhile her other twin cub , @entity14 - which means ' magnificent ' - sleep peacefully at her feet as the family prepares to go on display for the first time			1
more than 51,000 people voted for the names on @entity35 until now one of the twins has been looked after in a nursery as a panda 's instinct is to abandon one of them the two cubs , which were born in july , were the first panda cubs to be born in @entity25 in 2013 and are @entity5 's fourth and fifth children			1
the delivery of twins surprised zookeepers who were only expecting one to be born , and they are the first panda twins in the @entity25 since 1987			1
these pictures mark the first time that @entity5 has been allowed to care for both babies , as pandas ' will naturally ignore one twin in the wild			0
the twin birth surprised zookeepers as ultrasound scans had shown only one baby , but two were born the two cubs were named at 100 days old , in keeping with @entity12 tradition which recognises that a large number of panda cubs die when they are very young giant pandas are notoriously difficult to breed as they have naturally low sex drives and can accidentally crush their young shortly after birth because the cubs are so small the 15 - year - old female panda was artificially inseminated using sperm from her partner , @entity69 , who was born with her at the @entity70			1
the pair are on loan to @entity6 , in @entity73 , along with three others , the attraction pays yearly rent to @entity12 to keep them there and has alos donated $ 10million to panda conservation			0
there are thought to be jut 1,600 wild panda left , living on hilly mountain ranges in central @entity12			0
the animals are notoriously difficult to breed , often lacking a sex drive , and sometimes accidentally crushing small cubs shortly after birth , leading to falling numbers in the wild			0
the 15 - year - old @entity5 was artificially inseminated using sperm from her partner @entity69 who was born at the same centre as her in @entity12 @entity5 and @entity69 are two of the five pandas at @entity6 which they rent from @entity12 for an annual fee the pandas are endangered due to low breeding rate , and deforestation of bamboo forests which is all they eat they also depend on bamboo forests for their sole food source , which have been decimated by human deforestation			2
a quirk of evolution means that the natural meat - eater has come to feed solely on plants , and its digestive system extracts precious little energy from the stalks it eats			0
as a result pandas must eat 23 to 36lb ( 12 to 15 kg ) of bamboo each day which takes them an astonishing 12 hours , meaning they are particularly vulnerable if food starts to disappear .			0
