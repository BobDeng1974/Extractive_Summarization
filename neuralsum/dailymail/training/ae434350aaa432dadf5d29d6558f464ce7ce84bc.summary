@entity1 looked fresh - faced despite a late night the evening before , which saw her and long - term boyfriend @entity56 enjoying a low - key evening at @entity19 , a @entity58 restaurant in the heart of @entity28			0
the flame - haired royal , who is making a name for herself as quite the fashionista , looked sophisticated and chic in a fitted black dress , which she teamed with a tailored monochrome blazer			0
writing about the restaurant , a @entity67 reviewer writes : ' if you 're pining for the @entity70 , or neighbouring @entity71 , you might consider heading over to @entity19 , which aims to capture some of that region 's gastronomic spirit			2
' the menu features tender grilled veal chops , lamb cutlets with smoked aubergine and whole sea bream cooked en papillote with lemon and herbs			0
who knew they were friends ? @entity1 was last week joined by long - term boyfriend @entity84 a meal with @entity86 and his partner @entity87 in one of the more surprising buddy - ups of recent times , princess @entity1 enjoyed a double date last wednesday with funny man @entity86			2

@entity1 was joined by long - term boyfriend @entity84 for the meal , while @entity86 was accompanied by his partner @entity87			0

dishes include seared , miso marinated foie gras with umeboshi compote and moromi miso marinated baby chicken , oven roasted on cedar wood			0
yet again , the website states no prices			0
she loves a night out ! princess @entity1 seems to be an unofficial restaurant reviewer and has visited the trendiest restaurants that @entity5 has to offer , such as the @entity117 , right two weeks ago , she was seen strolling hand - in - hand with prince @entity121 's ex-girlfriend @entity119 as they enjoyed an evening out at @entity122 's - a very exclusive private members club			1
the week before that , at the end of april , she enjoyed a romantic night out at celebrity hotspot , the @entity117 , which she has visited a few times in recent weeks			1
' @entity117 ' , as it is called ( or hashtagged ) by those who get to dine within its very exclusive confines , is the latest offering from hip hotelier @entity132			1
the past fortnight alone has seen the likes of @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 dine there			0
@entity117 is part of the group owned by renowned hotelier @entity132 ' collection of bespoke , luxury hotels which include celebrity favourites @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 in @entity149 and @entity150 in @entity151 plus @entity152			1

the comfy , modern interior of the @entity117			2
diners sit in close quarters and are able to watch the bustling open kitchen at work ... if they can take their eyes off the revolving celeb doors that is princess @entity1 and @entity176 enjoyed two mother - daughter dates in a week			0
the royal pair were seen leaving glamorous 45 @entity180 restaurant in @entity28 in april , having enjoyed another gourmet dinner			0
while most of us have to curtail nights out during the week , or risk falling asleep at our desks , the 25 - year - old royal is lucky enough not to have to get up for work in the morning			0
the dinner marked the third time that @entity1 had hit the town that week			0
on the wednesday night , @entity176 and princess @entity1 were joined by her ex-husband the @entity191 for dinner at smart @entity28 restaurant ‘ @entity17 ’ while the friday before , @entity1 was seen leaving the @entity117 ( again ) , where she had been dining with friends			1
date night : @entity46 is often accompanied by her long - term boyfriend @entity47			0
one of the couple 's favourite eateries is the @entity117 in mid-april , @entity176 and prince @entity198 dined with their daughter in @entity5 's fashionable @entity201			1
the happy trio had a quiet family supper at the fashionable @entity204 on @entity205			0
it was an unusual choice for the group - edgy @entity207 , although gentrified , is n’t yet a royal stamping ground			0
@entity20 is a former pub decorated with stuffed animals and dangling handbags , and serves up dishes such as £ 25 dish of poached ballotine of chicken and lobster , and a £ 21.50 organic salmon with spinach , potato @entity220 , and a champagne butter sauce			0
@entity27 , @entity223 , @entity224 @entity117 around @entity225 , the @entity1 enjoyed a night out with boyfriend @entity47 at famous @entity28 restaurant @entity16			2
a notorious celebrity hangout , the young royal was at @entity16 at the same time as singer @entity229 and friends but confident @entity1 seemed unfazed by the media attention , smiling for the waiting press as she exited the pricey restaurant , loved by @entity234 and @entity235			0
princess @entity46 must have a penchant for @entity26 food , considering that over half of the restaurants she 's visited in recent weeks serve sushi and sashmini , perhaps that 's how she maintains her trim figure			1
while the @entity191 and @entity244 prefer a quiet night in ( the royal couple were once spotted buying pizza and salad at their local @entity247 ) , at least princess @entity1 is representing the young royal set , showcasing some serious style credentials and helping support @entity28 's gastronomic economy .			2
