@entity0 admitted @entity2 ’s confidence had been ‘ smashed ’ after his first @entity4 game ended in a shock 2 - 1 defeat by @entity7			1
@entity9 ’s 72nd - minute strike inflicted @entity11 ’s first setback as @entity2 manager following six straight wins in pre-season as @entity2 lost a home opener for the first time in 42 years			1
‘ when you win everything in preparation time and lose your first match , that can not be worse , ’ he said			2
‘ we have built up a lot of confidence and then it will be smashed down because of this result			2
asked if the defeat highlighted the need for reinforcements , @entity11 said : ‘ i thought that before this match , so it ’s no different			1
when we were playing in the @entity45 i saw the same			0
of course we need defenders			0
but you ca n’t say that , because we lost one game and we won all the others , that it ’s the defence			0
it ’s the team and how we played			2
’ in typical @entity11 style , the @entity34 pulled no punches after the final whistle			1
the new @entity2 manager criticised his players for being nervous			1
he also said they lacked confidence and did not play as a team			1
in fact , the 63 - year - old said his first official game in charge of the 20 - time @entity66 champions was the stuff of nightmares			1
' when you have preparation time and you win everything and your first match you lose , it can not be worse , i believe , ' @entity11 said			1
' it 's a very bad day for us			1
it 's very disappointing for the players , the fans , for me , and the staff			2
' debut despair : @entity36 made his first @entity4 start for @entity2 against @entity7 @entity11 swept into @entity83 with a swagger after pre-season wins over a sextet of teams with 35 @entity89 trophies between them			1
but on a chilly afternoon in @entity90 , @entity2 were brought back down to earth			2
some of @entity2 's build - up play was slow , they lacked pace up front , and organisation at the back			1
@entity11 's toughest task of his reign so far will be picking his men up for next week 's trip to @entity101			1
' we have built up a lot of confidence and then it shall be smashed down because of this result , ' @entity11 said			1
' we are not reaching our level			0
that 's the main thing			0
because of that we did n't play as a team			2
' @entity11 claimed on friday that @entity110 struggled to handle the pressure of being @entity2 captain in tuesday 's friendly win over @entity114			1
tall order : @entity116 was unable to prevent @entity2 losing and conceding two goals the @entity2 manager thinks many more of his players buckled under the pressure of trying to make a positive start to the season following last year 's dire showing under @entity124			1
' i saw a lot of players looking very nervous , making the wrong choices and that is a pity , ' the former @entity126 coach said			0
' these players have to forget that expectation because that is @entity2			1
' you have to cope with that pressure			0
that is also a process			0
' but we have to know that it is only one game of many games			0
' you shall not be the champion at this moment			0
you shall be the champion in may			0
' @entity7 delight : @entity9 celebrates after scoring from close range with nine players out through injury , @entity11 handed debuts to @entity36 and @entity35			1
the duo performed reasonably well , although @entity35 had his afternoon cut short thanks to a tackle from @entity153			0
the 21 - year - old left the stadium on crutches and looks set for a spell on the sidelines			0
@entity11 's men got off to the worst possible start when @entity160 turned home @entity9 square pass and the @entity164 international drove past @entity165 in the second half after accidentally being teed - up by @entity168 's mis - placed shot			1
when asked whether he thought he needed to add new players to his squad , @entity11 said : ' yes , but i thought that before this match			2
' i know in what positions we need better players			0
but you have to buy only when the player can fulfil the way of playing that i ask			0
' one plus - point for @entity11 is that @entity180 is close to full fitness following his late return from the @entity183			2
' we are now training with @entity180 for three weeks so the point that he can come in to the selection is closer now , ' said @entity11 , who left his compatriot out of his match day squad			2
@entity189 was delighted to have led @entity7 to their first league win at @entity83			1
the @entity191 are among the favourites to go down this year , but @entity189 thinks his team can go on to surprise a few more people			0
' nobody gave us a chance before the game , but we can be better than that , ' the @entity7 manager said			2
' we can be sharper and improve in certain areas , but today we were right in many aspects , and we got the right result			0
' i 'm very pleased overall			0
we were very good today and showed a great attitude			0
hopefully we can have more days like this			0
