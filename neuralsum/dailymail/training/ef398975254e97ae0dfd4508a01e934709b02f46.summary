the @entity1 revolution has already started in earnest at @entity3 - but the @entity5 boss is set to lavish another £ 150million on new recruitments next summer			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 all arrived in the summer for upwards of £ 150m but @entity14 is nowhere near finished with reshaping his squad just yet			1
here , @entity16 takes a look at the five players who top the @entity5 manager 's wishlist for next summer ... @entity22 ( @entity23 ) - likely fee : £ 30m age : 24 ( @entity26 13/02/90 ) position : defensive midfielder teams : @entity30 ( 2008 - 11 ) , @entity31 ( 2011 ) , @entity32 ( 2011 - 13 ) , @entity23 ( 2013 - ) club appearances : 216 club goals : 34 @entity35 caps : 25 international goals : 3 the @entity23 midfielder , 24 , might have been a @entity5 player already had he not suffered a knee injury in march and the club have retained a strong interest			1
@entity14 is a huge fan of the box - to - box midfielder and even resorted to completely overhauling @entity35 's formation at the @entity43 to 3 - 5 - 2 from 4 - 3 - 3 due to the absence of who he considered to be the linchpin of his side			2
@entity22 still remains very much a part of @entity14 's plans going forward and , at just 24 , he could become a mainstay in the @entity5 midfield			1
his strong , powerful style should be perfectly suited to the @entity53 and he is still being strongly courted by @entity5			0
@entity22 of @entity23 is a transfer target for @entity5 next summer @entity1 is a long - term admirer of @entity22 ( left ) and believes he will excel in the @entity53 @entity56 ( @entity57 ) - likely fee : £ 28.5m the experienced @entity57 central defender , 28 , is on @entity5 ’s list of targets but they would have to trigger the £ 28.5m release clause in his contract if they want to sign him			1
@entity56 was a mainstay in the @entity57 side who won @entity65 last season - as well as reaching the @entity67 final , in which he scored			0
the @entity69 star would bring some much needed knowledge and experience to a @entity5 back four which is seriously lacking in those departments			0
@entity74 ( @entity75 ) - likely fee : £ 32m despite having been rebuffed in their advances for the @entity80 centre back last summer , @entity3 paymasters are ready to try again			2
@entity74 is calm on the ball and , like @entity56 , would slot straight into the @entity5 side at the heart of their defence			2
@entity75 have struggled this year , however , and sit bottom of the @entity87 - so @entity86 may soon look for pastures new			0
age : 25 ( @entity90 16/12/88 ) position : centre back teams : @entity93 ( 2006 - 07 ) , @entity75 ( loan 2008 - 09 , 2009 - ) club appearances : 280 club goals : 25 @entity80 @entity97 : 38 international goals : 4 age : 28 ( @entity26 16/02/86 ) position : centre back teams : @entity102 ( 2003 - 06 ) , @entity103 ( 2006 - 07 ) , @entity104 ( 2007 - 10 ) , @entity57 ( 2010 - ) club appearances : 390 club goals : 26 @entity69 @entity97 : 85 international goals : 4 @entity56 ( left ) of @entity57 and @entity75 's @entity74 ( right ) are also targets @entity56 ( left ) helped @entity57 to win the @entity110 title from centre back last season @entity74 ( left ) has been playing in a @entity75 team who are bottom of the @entity87 this season @entity115 ( @entity116 ) - likely fee : free @entity5 want elite players and signing the 31 - year - old @entity119 right back , out of contract at @entity116 next summer , would be a coup			1
defensive reinforcements are what @entity14 desperately needs and he could fill the problem right - back position for the club			0
he is the ultimate modern - day full back - bombing forward at will and far strong going forward than in defence			0
@entity129 ( @entity93 ) - likely fee : £ 20m @entity14 has made little secret of his desire to be reunited with the @entity93 winger , 30 , who was a key member of his @entity35 squad at the @entity43			2
@entity129 is settled in @entity135 and it remains to be seen whether he would be willing to up sticks and leave an established , dominant @entity93 side under @entity139			0
a midfield containing both @entity129 and @entity7 at @entity5 could be potentially mouthwatering , though			0
age : 31 ( @entity26 06/05/83 ) position : right back teams : @entity144 ( 2001 - 02 ) , @entity145 ( 2002 - 08 ) , @entity116 ( 2008 - ) club appearances : 580 club goals : 38 @entity119 @entity97 : 74 international goals : 6 age : 30 ( @entity26 23/01/84 ) position : centre back teams : @entity152 ( 2000 - 02 ) , @entity32 ( 2002 - 04 ) , @entity153 ( 2004 - 07 ) , @entity154 ( 2007 - 09 ) , @entity93 ( 2009 - ) @entity156 goals : 161 @entity97 : 86 international goals : 28 @entity115 ( left ) of @entity116 and @entity93 star @entity129 ( right ) are being courted too right back @entity158 ( centre ) would give experience in defence and solve a problem position for @entity5 @entity129 ( left ) featured prominently for @entity14 's @entity35 side and could move back to @entity164			1

@entity5 spent more than £ 150m on signings in the summer
@entity1 's revolution is far from complete at @entity3 though
@entity5 boss is set to spend another £ 150m on players next summer
@entity22 , @entity56 and @entity129 are on his wishlist
