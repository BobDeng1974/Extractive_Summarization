the codpieces used in the hit @entity2 drama @entity3 were too small and should have been double the size , according to an expert			1
this is one of a number of inaccuracy spotted in the big budget adaptation of @entity11 's books and was said to have been done so as not to offend and baffle the shows @entity14 audience			1
@entity15 , who has researched the codpiece for her phd , said those used in the show would have been far too modest for @entity21 's court			1
@entity22 , pictured left , with a small and modest codpiece , and a @entity26 portrait , right , with a much more noticeable and prominent garment homeland star @entity22 played @entity21 in the six - part series on the rapid rise to power of sir @entity31 in @entity33 's court ' they 're way too small to be accurate – they should be at least double the size , ' said the @entity38 academic , according to the @entity39			1
' you can kind of see them there , but they are n't really stuffed , and are easily missed – they 've really toned them down for a mainstream audience			0
' the codpiece was meant to draw the eye to the general region			2
' @entity47 , who played @entity31 , blamed there diminutive size on a ' directive from our @entity14 producers '			1
' i was n't personally disappointed by the codpieces : i 'm a little more used to them than other people from being at the @entity57 for ten years , ' @entity47 said , according to the @entity58			1
' but i can see for modern audiences , perhaps more in @entity14 , they may not know exactly what 's going on down there			1
' in the time of @entity21 the codpiece was a fashion accessory , which was said to be a symbol of a @entity68 man 's ' virility '			1
@entity22 , who played @entity21 , admitted that the codpieces were a source of some ' giggling ' during filming			2
this is not the first time that the show has come under fire for historical errors			2
when it first aired , historians criticised the decision to cast @entity81 as @entity21 's third wife @entity82 because she was too pretty			1
seymour seen in a portrait by @entity85 artist @entity84 , is depicted with a noticeably large forehead , double chin , and thin pursed lips			0
according to @entity89 , 41 , chief curator at @entity90 , miss @entity81 , 25 , has features which are too dainty			0
miss @entity89 said : ' she 's too pretty			2
i did challenge @entity93 [ the director ] about that			0
he laughed and said , " i picked her because of her acting , not because of her forehead "			0
' historians also pointed out that @entity99 in @entity100 , which was used to portray @entity101 , is from the elizabethan period			0
historian @entity89 has said that @entity81 , pictured left , who plays @entity21 's wife @entity104 , portrait pictured right , in @entity2 drama @entity3 is too pretty miss @entity89 has previously questioned the authenticity of some aspects of the programme , claiming both the original books and now this adaptation have brought the characters firmly into the modern day			1
she said : ' what @entity11 has done is made these characters people for our times , which is interesting for a historian to watch			0
they are immensely modern , they wo n't be saying thee and thou and being all dramatic and over the top			0
' i think it will make people think the @entity128 were just like us in many ways			0
that 's a massive historical question , in some ways they were and in some ways they were n't			0
' the programme - makers have revealed the lengths they have gone to to ensure historical accuracy – including an unexpected insistence on straight , white teeth and pristine linen			0
@entity11 said a @entity68 drama would be less accurate had it insisted on blackened teeth and filthy courtiers – as it was a time when sugar was yet to become widely available .			2
