by @entity0 a mother who lost a fifth of the skin on her legs to meningitis has urged others to be aware of symptoms of the disease			1
@entity9 , 37 , thought she was suffering from flu when she contracted a fever and began to feel dizzy at work			1
but when she woke up the next day unable to move her legs she quickly realised her condition was a lot more serious and she was rushed to hospital			1
@entity9 , 37 , suffered severe skin damage when she developed meningitis doctors swiftly diagnosed her with an aggressive form of meningitis and she was placed in an induced coma to keep her alive			1
as a result of the disease , the hospital worker lost a fifth of the skin on her legs and parts of her toes			1
ms @entity9 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , has now spoken out to warn others it is not just children and teenagers who can be affected by the deadly illness			2
she said before she developed meningitis and septicaemia she thought the infection was only contracted by youngsters			2
ms @entity9 also lost a fifth of the skin on her legs , most of her toes and had to spend three months in hospital recovering from the illness ' i had gone home from work feeling quite unwell but i did n’t think it was anything serious			1
i had a fever and felt quite dizzy , ' she said			2
' by the next day it had got a lot worse			2
i could n’t move my legs , that ’s when i realised it was probably a lot more serious so i called an ambulance			1
' i felt really embarrassed calling 999 because i worked at the infirmary and i did n’t want people thinking i was overreacting			0
i do n’t remember much after that			0
' source : @entity61 following the incident a year ago , she woke up in the burns unit at @entity65 , @entity32			2
doctors told her 20 per cent of the skin on her legs had burned away as a result of the disease , and parts of her toes had also fallen off			1
ms @entity9 lost part of her skin because she also developed septicaemia			1
the @entity76 says when the bacteria that cause meningitis and septicaemia invade the bloodstream they produce toxins that attack the lining of the blood vessels so they start to leak			2
this leakage of blood means that there is not enough blood to carry oxygen to all parts of the body			0
at the same time , the toxins cause blood clots to form in the tiny blood vessels in the skin , making it even harder for blood to reach all parts of the body			0
to maintain circulation to the vital organs , the circulatory system reduces the blood supply to the extremities such as the hands , feet and the surface of the skin			0
when skin loses blood supply , it is starved of oxygen and vital nutrients , and patches of it die off and blacken			0
this most often happens to tissue on the fingers , hands , toes and feet because the blood has further to travel to reach these areas			0
ms @entity9 ( pictured with her daughter , @entity119 ) was diagnosed with meningitis after developing a fever and dizziness and waking up to find she could not move her legs in extreme cases this can lead to the loss of fingers and toes and sometimes limbs or parts of limbs may need to be amputated			1
throughout her traumatic three months in hospital @entity131 , a charity set up to support victims of the disease , helped ms @entity9 in a variety of ways			1
she said : ' they were always there to talk to			0
they checked up on me			0
' it can be quite a lonely thing being in hospital			0
' a lot of things were happening to my body as well			0
' it was so nice to have someone to explain it all to me and for me to talk to even after i left hospital			0
' ms @entity9 now wants to raise awareness about the symptoms of meningitis			1
these include a high fever , a headache , neck stiffness , an aversion to bright light and a red rash that does not disappear under pressure .			0
