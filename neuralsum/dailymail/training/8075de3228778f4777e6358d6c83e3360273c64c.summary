by @entity0 it might not be quite as well - known as its famous namesake in @entity4 - but this @entity5 is certainly no less impressive			1
the stunning 26 - bedroom manor house in @entity7 under @entity8 , @entity9 , is not only set across 935 acres of land , but also has a fascinating history dating back to the 15th century			1
and now anyone who fancies saying they live in @entity5 is in with a chance - as long as they have £ 12million to hand over			1
not that one ! @entity5 , in @entity7 under @entity8 , @entity9 , which shares a name with the royal palace in @entity4 , has been put on the market for £ 12million the stunning 15th @entity18 is set on sprawling estate which covers 935 acres of land , including farms , cottages , an orangery and landscaped gardens the grade i listed manor house was built after being ordered by @entity28 , @entity29 , who was crowned @entity28 in 1399 - not the same @entity30 which built @entity31 the whole estate is split into five lots , meaning the house could be bought along with a smaller portion of land - 74 acres - for a slightly more modest £ 4.5million unlike @entity31 in @entity4 , the @entity37 i listed manor house and its sprawling estate of farms , cottages and woodland is up for grabs and could soon be lived in - albeit by a rather large family			1
and those with a more modest budget could still buy the castle - complete with a comparatively smaller 74 - acre portion of land - for about £ 4.5million			1
but , just like @entity31 , whoever it is that buys the property will be following a long line of historic owners			2
the property was ordered to be built as a house by @entity28 , @entity29 , who was crowned @entity28 in 1399			1
it was then granted by @entity28 to sir @entity57 when he married @entity58 , daughter of the @entity59 and a cousin of the king			2
@entity57 , who built the original quadrangular manor house in 1427 , was then granted a licence to crenellate the property - which means he was allowed to fortify the house - by @entity67			2
the house became a castle in 1434 and the interior has been revamped and redesigned by its different owners			0
it now has a heraldic theme throughout the property when the castle was renovated by former owner @entity75 in the 1990s , the rooms were filled with an abundance of armoury , including a chandelier set with stag heads the plush dining room boats a stunning chandelier , ornate curtains and thick wood - panelled walls which are in touch with the property 's historic roots sir @entity57 was succeeded by his daughter , who married the @entity89			1
their grandson then sold @entity5 to sir @entity92 in 1510			2
after that , @entity5 remained in the @entity92 family , a prominent noble @entity9 family , until the early 19th century when the estate was purchased by @entity96			1
he was the son of the famous inventor sir @entity96 , who rose from poverty to invent the spinning frame , which came to the fore during the @entity102			0
@entity96 's son @entity103 then comissioned the remodelling of the house in the 1830s and 40s			0
the @entity107 lived at @entity5 until 1912			2
the castle , which includes its own quaint chapel , pictured , was looked after by a line of aristocrats before remaining in the @entity92 family - a prominent noble @entity9 family - until the @entity114 it was then taken over by the son of the famous inventor sir @entity96 , who invented the spinning frame , which was used in the @entity102 in the 1990s , the house was revamped again by @entity118 owner @entity75			1
he spent millions restoring the crumbling building and introducing a heraldic theme - including a chandelier set with stag heads - to the castle			2
now the castle also boasts an ambitious garden , which is encased by @entity126 walls			0
the gardens include stunning flower displays divided by canals , island pavilions and pleached avenues			0
the grounds include a waterfall in a sunken garden , pictured left , among the vast lawns and beautiful trees , which look out over woodland and fields the landscaped gardens include a maze , a flower garden divided by canals and an ornamental kitchen garden of fruit and vegetables , used to supply produce to the orangery , which is housed in the conservatory built in 1836 the sunken garden , left , is accessed through a 150 - year - old wisteria tunnel , which is covered with draping trees and leads to the castle 's stunning gardens today , the kitchen garden is full of organic fruit and vegetables used by the orangery restaurant , which is housed in a conservatory attached to the property in 1836			1
just like @entity31 , there is also a maze with a gothic tower at its centre , from where there is a panoramic view over the estate			2
there is also a 150 - year - old wisteria tunnel that leads to a waterfall in the sunken garden , as well as vast lawns and ancient trees			0
the house also featured in the @entity175 , a post-apocalyptic series about people who had survived a plague , which aired in the 1970s			0
many parts of the first series were filmed in and around the house , which was empty at the time			0
arguably the country 's most famous @entity5 is the royal palace based in @entity184 , @entity4			1
@entity31 has not been lived in by the @entity185 since the 18th century but , along with @entity187 , it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many owned by @entity191 it was originally built for cardinal @entity192 , a favourite of @entity191 , in 1514			1
but fifteen years later , when @entity192 fell from favour , the palace was passed to the king , who enlarged it			0
the next century , @entity198 's rebuilt and expanded the castle , in an attempt to rival the revered @entity201			0
but work was stopped in 1694 , before the project was completed			0
it left the palace with two distinct styles - @entity207 and @entity208 - which still remains to this day			0
today , the palace is open to the public and is a major tourist attraction			1
the palace is cared for by an independent charity , @entity213			0
the palace 's @entity214 is the site of the annual @entity216 and @entity217 , which is renowned around the world .			0

@entity5 in @entity9 was built in the 15th century after being order by @entity28
the stunning 26 - bedroom property stands in 935 acres of land , which includes farms , cottages and an orangery
the estate is on the market for £ 12m but the castle and a smaller portion of land - 74 acres - can be bought for £ 4.5m
it shares *similarities* with tourist attraction @entity31 in @entity4 , which was home to @entity191
