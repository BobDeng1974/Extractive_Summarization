@entity0 , 46 , was found not guilty of two counts of rape at the @entity13 yesterday , following a high - profile eight - day case			1
he was alleged to have raped a fellow protester – with whom he was in a ‘ casual ’ sexual relationship – inside her tent as they took part in the @entity21 protest in january last year			1
on one occasion , the jury had been told , he attacked her when she had passed out drunk			1
he was accused on another occasion of tying a belt around her neck and ‘ throttling ’ her while he forced her to perform a sex act			2
the self - styled leader of the @entity32 group visibly shook and closed his eyes as the jury returned a not guilty verdict after 11 hours and 14 minutes			2
afterwards mr @entity0 , a street entertainer , claimed he was a ‘ victim ’ of the legal system and called for anonymity for those accused of sexual assault			1
speaking outside court , he said : ‘ everybody ’s a victim			2
twelve months my life ’s been on hold , i ’ve not eaten , i ’ve not slept			2
‘ i ’ve been vilified – my career is in ruins			2
i ’m a street performer – a magician			2
but there ’ll always be doubts – there ’ll always be those who say , “ oh , he got away with it ”			0
’ criticising the @entity52 for bringing the case to court , he said : ‘ i feel it was never in the public interest			0
‘ there was never any evidence of a crime			0
to have to stand in the dock as long as i have with my life in limbo has had a serious effect on my health			0
‘ i now wish to slide back into anonymity from where i came			0
’ the former court security guard said he would dedicate his time to campaigning for anonymity for rape defendants			0
he said : ‘ i feel very strongly that the law needs to be reviewed with regard to anonymity to both parties with cases like this			0
’ the woman who claimed she had been raped was not in court to hear the verdict , but afterwards , the @entity78 expressed their disappointment			1
detective sergeant @entity80 , the officer who led the investigation , said : ‘ today ’s outcome is obviously a disappointing one for both myself and the victim			0
‘ the bravery and tenacity of the victim has been key to bringing this matter to trial and i can only commend her on doing it with such strength and integrity under what were , and have been , very difficult circumstances			0
‘ her willingness to cooperate fully with the police should be heartening to those in a similar situation and i hope this will encourage others to come forward , regardless of the decision of the jury today			0
’ protest : mr @entity0 shakes the hand of another activist outside @entity4 's in february 2012 well known : @entity0 being interviewed on the eve of the camp 's eviction by the authorities camp : @entity0 frequently spoke to the media on behalf of @entity32 during the occupy @entity110 protest protest site : the woman claimed she was attacked twice by @entity0 , 45 , inside the central @entity110 camp mr @entity0 , of @entity114 , @entity115 , was accused of raping the woman on january 21 and 28 last year			1
jurors heard that he was alleged to have used rape to ‘ punish her ’ when she became too clingy and a ‘ nuisance ’			1
the woman said she did not go to the police until june because she felt ‘ ashamed and embarrassed ’			1
but mr @entity0 insisted the allegations were a ‘ complete fabrication ’ and that she had invented the attacks to get back at him after discovering he had slept with another activist on january 25			1
the court heard that mr @entity0 had three sexual relationships during the four - month protest camp outside @entity4 ’s , between october 2011 and february 2012			1
he kept a tally of his sexual ‘ conquests ’ on the outside of his tent , something he dismissed as ‘ a lads ’ joke ’ and an attempt to ‘ boost morale ’ in the camp			1
the @entity21 protest , which campaigned against corporate greed , was finally removed by bailiffs in february			0
his barrister , @entity144 , told the court during the trial : ‘ he may be , in old - fashioned terminology , a cad , a bounder , a womaniser			0
‘ he may be a four - letter word starting in ‘ s ’ and ending in ‘ t ’ , but that does n’t make him a rapist			0

@entity0 , 46 , *thanked* the judge after he was discharged
@entity160 heard mr @entity0 had a ' relationship ' with the woman in 2011
but she said he attacked her twice in her tent at foot of @entity9
mr @entity0 , of @entity114 , @entity115 , denied the allegations
