by @entity0 worringly , in the recent past , @entity2 football enforced an unofficial entry restriction based solely on height			1
when assessing the impact made by the likes of @entity11 and @entity12 for both @entity13 and @entity14 some years ago , @entity6 , the current manager of the @entity7 under 21s , stated there was every chance that the pair would not have made in it in the @entity2 game simply because – at 5ft 7in - neither provided a threat at set pieces			1
if @entity6 ’s words were a depressing commentary on how prehistoric the @entity2 game had become , then we should be thankful that the vast majority of clubs had already long since heeded them and mended their ways			1
in @entity29 , a former @entity55 player who came into the @entity57 youth set up in 2006 , the @entity54 club immediately saw they had a player small in stature but with enormous ability			2
brought under the wing of @entity32 ’s progressive youth supremo @entity63 , @entity29 ’s natural talent was such that he was invariably asked to demonstrate training drills to the assembled hopefuls			1
there and then , the moniker @entity31 was his to keep			2
long before @entity68 handed him his debut as a 16 - year - old against @entity72 in the final match of season 2011 - 12 , the jungle drums were beating about the 5ft 6in sensation			1
by the time the following campaign was underway , it was clear for all to see that all the hype was not unjustified			0
costly : @entity29 has an incredible £ 48million release clause in his @entity33 contract promise : @entity33 signed talented teenager @entity29 from @entity32 on a six - year contract @entity83 inspires @entity32 with four assists it was n’t so much @entity29 ’s ability to ghost away from players at will that caught the eye			1
nor was it just his mesmerising ball control			0
what really stood out was his impeccable decision making in the final third			0
time and again , he executed exactly the right pass with exactly the right pace at exactly the right moment			0
game intelligence far beyond his tender years			0
defenders eliminated left , right and centre			0
as befits any teenager , there have inevitably been humps in the road over the course of the past couple of seasons			0
@entity29 was virtually unplayable last winter but a sudden loss in form prompted @entity113 , his manager , to send him and team - mate @entity114 off to a sunshine break in @entity14			1
despite his tender years , @entity29 is a player who has always known his own mind			2
upon picking up a player of the month award last season , he was inevitably asked about his future intentions			0
the answer was interesting : not the predictable move to the @entity124 or the @entity125 but perhaps @entity14 : somewhere where he ’d get time to play			0
@entity33 were clearly hanging on his every word			2
@entity129 : @entity29 makes excellent decisions on the pitch as much as anything else in his game in many ways he ’s a throwback to the halcyon days of @entity2 football when the likes of @entity138 tortured hulking defenders			1
earlier this year there was a heart - warming tale of a man walking through a @entity144 park on afternoon and spotting a handful of kids having a kickabout			2
darned good , in fact			0
at closer inspection the group revealed themselves to be none other than @entity29 and friends enjoying a game on their day off			2
in the blink of an eye , the one dubbed @entity31 is a £ 3m @entity33 player with a £ 48m release clause			1
thank heavens that height restriction was thrown in the bin			0
alike ? @entity29 has been nicknamed ' @entity31 ' due to similarities in playing style next in line ? @entity29 will hope to follow in the footsteps of @entity166 at @entity33			1

@entity29 signed for @entity33 from @entity32 on a six - year contract for £ 3m deal with a £ 48m release clause
the 5ft 6in *attacking* *midfielder* would have been too short for @entity2 football under unofficial height restrictions
@entity2 teenager nicknamed ' @entity31 ' and ' @entity177 ' after @entity13 and @entity179 great @entity178
