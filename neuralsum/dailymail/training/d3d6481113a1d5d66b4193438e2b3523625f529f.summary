by @entity0 if you are struggling to cope with the pressures of another monday morning , blame your mother			0
researchers claim to have discovered why some people are more prone to suffering from stress and anxiety than others – they shared their mother ’s stress while still in the womb			1
@entity12 , the placenta , the baby ’s lifeline as it grows in the womb , protects it from hormones that build up in the mother ’s blood when she is stressed			0
in some women , however , the protection is weak and the harmful hormones cross from mother to baby			1
pregnancy : research suggests that women who lack a protective enzyme in the womb affect their unborn children with their stresses @entity34 researcher professor @entity33 said : ‘ there is an enzyme found in high levels in the placenta and the baby ’s brain			1
it seems to be a natural barrier to stress hormones and it deactivates them			0
‘ if you inhibit this barrier then you start to get children with a low birth weight who have altered stress responses and depression			1
‘ this may be what underpins the variation you get from one individual to another			0
’ the research suggests that babies exposed tot their mother 's stress later in pregnancy are more likely to develop depression or be susceptible to @entity64 it is thought that the protective barrier can be overwhelmed by high levels of stress in pregnancy			1
in other cases , some women may not make enough of the barrier enzyme to begin with			0
once the stress hormones have breached the barrier , they can affect the delicate developing brain and trigger changes that leave the child prone to anxiety and behavioural problems as he or she grows up			1
curiously , eating large amounts of liquorice in pregnancy may have the same effect			0
professor @entity33 has shown that mothers - to - be who gorge on the sweet treat seem to raise the odds of their unborn child becoming anxious and badly behaved			1
he said : ‘ when we looked at @entity92 women – who tend to eat a lot of liquorice – those who ate a bag a day compared with those who did not tended to have babies born a couple of days earlier			2
‘ by the age of eight , we saw a two - thirds increase in the rates of attention deficits and anxiety behaviours			0
’ it is thought that a compound in liquorice helps break down the protective barrier , allowing stress hormones to pass from mother to child			2
stress in the womb may also have long - term effects on the unborn child ’s physical health			2
a recent study of @entity116 mothers - to - be found that going through a major upheaval , such as a bereavement or separation , dramatically raised the odds of their baby suffering ill - health by the age of four .			0

researchers at the @entity34 found mothers ' wombs and babies ' brains contain a **chemical** protecting them from a mother 's stress
but some women lack this **chemical** exposing their unborn babies to stress
those exposed appear to be more susceptible to anxiety and depression
