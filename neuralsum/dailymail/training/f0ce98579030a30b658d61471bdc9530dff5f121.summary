@entity0 suffered an agonising defeat that could prove terminal to their hopes of qualifying for the @entity6 knock - out stages as their young tyros were outgunned by a star - studded @entity9 outfit			1
following last week 's embarrassing loss in @entity12 , @entity0 were desperate to claim their first win of the @entity15 campaign but four - times winners @entity17 had an attacking edge that saw them score three tries to one and left @entity0 having to settle for a losing bonus - point at the @entity22 @entity0 fly - half @entity23 , eager to press his case for a starting spot in the forthcoming @entity28 series , struggled to spark his back - line despite a remarkable set - piece performance from his side 's injury - hit pack , which included a hugely impressive first start from 19 - year - old academy star @entity34			1
@entity0 fly - half , and @entity36 hopeful , @entity23 struggled against a powerful @entity17 defence at the @entity22 @entity17 's @entity38 holds off @entity23 's tackle to cross for the @entity9 side in their win over @entity0 @entity17 players raise their arms in celebration as @entity0 's hands go on their heads in disappointment @entity0 's @entity48 campaign is now in tatters after two losses in two matches ' we were that close , ' said @entity0 head coach @entity53 , who believed his side should have been awarded a penalty in the dying minutes			1
' but i 'm proud of the guys			0
they left nothing out on the field			0
@entity34 is a star of the future			0
' but without the injured @entity62 at @entity63 , and in the face of a world - class @entity17 defence , @entity0 were unable to break down their opponents until replacement hooker @entity68 crossed in the 75th minute			1
without @entity62 running clever angles off his shoulder , @entity69 turned the ball over three times in contact as he opted to carry when on other occasions he would have off - loaded			0
@entity0 's @entity68 scores a five - pointer at the @entity22 during their @entity77 match @entity0 's @entity78 gets his left arm free to offload while being tackled by @entity17 's @entity80 it will not have gone unnoticed by @entity82 that his second - choice no 10 has not fired on his two outings in @entity15 this season			1
at 21 , @entity69 has time on his side and will surely come good			0
yesterday @entity88 , starting his first game at @entity87 having won the under 20s @entity89 as a lock , showed enormous potential against @entity17 's world - class back row , which had the hulking @entity94 anchoring the scrum			2
@entity17 's @entity96 is driven back in a crunching tackle by @entity0 's @entity98 the fact @entity34 , only playing because of a horrendous run of back - row injuries , came out with plenty of credit suggests he has an exciting future			1
former @entity36 fly - half @entity105 converted tries by @entity96 and @entity108 , while @entity109 converted @entity38 's 65th - minute try			1
@entity0 centre @entity111 said : ' it was hard for some of us wider out to get into the game			2
we were n't quite there today			0
the fact it was only two points difference showed great character			0
it 's just gutting to lose			0
' @entity0 's next game is away to @entity125 on december 6 and with a trip to @entity17 also still on the schedule , the prospects of them qualifying from this pool now look slim			2
@entity17 winger @entity96 's try - saving tackle on @entity0 's @entity129 is a match winner the scene as @entity17 celebrate their victory at the picturesque @entity133 in @entity0			2

@entity0 must now win all four remaining matches in the @entity6
@entity17 tries came from @entity96 , @entity80 and @entity38 , while @entity105 ( two ) and @entity109 **kicked** conversions
@entity23 **kicked** three penalties , a drop - goal and a conversion
@entity68 scored a late try for the hosts but it was n't enough
