by @entity0 for the @entity1 my mum , @entity2 , is a lifelong @entity5 clothes shopper			1
from slacks to sparkly tops , everything she wears is scooped from the rails of this @entity11 favourite			1
but i do sometimes wonder if she does it all with her eyes shut			2
or maybe , at 68 , she ’s got used to playing it safe in beige , florals and the occasional sequin			1
in her defence , shopping in @entity5 can be a bit of a gamble for anyone — their clothes so often blur the line between frumpy and fashionable			2
but if @entity27 would just look beyond the ubiquitous waterfall cardigans and shapeless blouses , there are hidden gems to be found			1
i decided to show her where i think she ’s going wrong and suggested we browse through the new collection and each choose our favourite items			1
it looks designer and it gives a curvy shape , but it ’s not too tight			1
what more can you ask for ? mum looks fantastic and it knocks years off @entity49 says : i could n’t believe this was from @entity5 — boy , did it look risque ! i would never , ever have picked this up for myself — it ’s far too showy			1
but , i have to confess i love it			2
it ’s incredibly flattering , and the biggest surprise is how comfortable it is			2
i feel really glamorous in it — and i can still breathe			2
@entity60 coat , £ 89 @entity62 blouse , £ 28 long skirt , £ 45 boots , £ @entity64 says : this is so me			2
the anorak could go over absolutely everything i own			2
i love the stylish fur trim and the fact it ’s so cosy and comfortable			1
i chose this because i like the way it covers my @entity74 says : can you see why i ’ve been trying to persuade mum she ’s stuck in a style rut ? this outfit is dowdy from top to toe			1
cream coat , £ 249 metallic skirt , £ 149 cream top , £ 29.50 court shoes , £ @entity39 says : ok , i admit the skirt ’s a bit much , but the coat is hugely stylish and worth the money			1
@entity2 says : when i saw this coat , i thought it was a dressing gown			1
the next shock was the price — £ 249 is far more than i ’d usually spend on an entire outfit , let alone one item			2
but i admit that it did look — and feel — great			2
linen top , £ 22 chinos , £ 22.50 @entity100 £ @entity99 says : i ’ll live in this blouse			0
it ’s lovely and loose and the colour will go with anything			0
and the trousers are so comfy			0
@entity106 says : when @entity27 goes shopping , she ’s magnetically attracted to beige , so i ’m not surprised she ’s chosen this			1
i tell her the colour makes her look washed out , but she ignores me			0
@entity114 top , £ 35 @entity116 trousers , £ 45 court shoes , £ 79 @entity118 , £ @entity119 says : @entity27 ’s convinced herself she needs to wear loose - fitting trousers , but these tailored cigarette pants look terrific			0
the top is sophisticated and the colour adds @entity124 says : me in a pair of slinky trousers ? i never thought i ’d see the day at my age , but i can see that they are rather flattering			0
crucially , they ’re still comfortable , which for me , is a must			0
jumper , £ 21 long navy skirt , £ 45 ankle boots , £ @entity133 says : a skirt like this hides a multitude of sins and i can wear it with shoes or winter boots			0
the jumper is a neutral colour and the three - quarter length sleeves are flattering			0
@entity106 says : sorry mum , but where ’s the broomstick ? this really is an unflattering combination			1
the skirt piles pounds on you and the jumper ’s just ‘ blah ’			0
and as for the boots , there should be a law against anything that ugly			0
@entity156 , £ 139 @entity158 blouse , £ 35 leopard - print skirt , £ 35 @entity160 , £ 19.50 court shoes , £ @entity39 says : the pencil shape makes mum look slimmer and the animal print is subtle enough to look stylish without a hint of mutton			1
@entity2 says : i ’m amazed how different i look			1
the skirt i chose is shapeless in comparison to this one , and the animal print is trendy			0
but i ’m afraid there ’s simply no way i ’d wear these shoes			0
floral print dress , £ 39.50 shoes , £ @entity99 says : as a rule , i avoid dresses , but i like this one			1
the floral pattern ’s pretty and it ’s not too clingy round the middle			0
it ’s shorter than i prefer , but the sleeves are a flattering length to hide crepey arms			0
i ’d happily wear this to church or out to @entity190 says : it ’s probably best @entity27 does n’t buy too many dresses if this is what she goes for			1
put it back ! polka dot dress , £ 49.50 @entity160 , £ 8 shoes , £ @entity200 says : no sleeves , knee - length and fitted at the waist — i ’m really pushing @entity27 out of her comfort zone with this , but i think she looks fantastic			0
the pattern ’s understated and the colour is flattering			0
you ’re not past it , mum ! @entity2 says : i feel self - conscious about my chubby knees and there ’s far too much arm on show for my liking			1
quick ! someone get me a cardie			0
@entity2 says : this has definitely spurred me on to be more adventurous			1
i did n’t realise how much of a rut i was in			0
practically all my togs are from @entity5 — but they ’re all the same			0
it ’s time to ditch the beige			1
i thought the more fitted styles would be uncomfortable , but they were n’t and they were more flattering			0
@entity106 says : i really hope this is the wake - up call mum needs			1
instead of always buying the same old florals , she needs to experiment			2
i bet her friends wo n’t guess it ’s all from @entity5 .			0
