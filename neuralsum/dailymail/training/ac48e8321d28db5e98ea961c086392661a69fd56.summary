@entity5 gave birth to four girls and one boy on friday the 13th as her husband , @entity9 , stood by her side at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the couple , who were living at @entity15 , @entity16 where @entity9 was a staff sergeant , until they relocated to be close to the @entity12 hospital , let their son @entity19 name his new siblings			1
the six - year - old chose @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 - so the children 's names , including @entity19 's , now match up with the first six letters of the alphabet			1
the babies were born between 8.15am and 8.17am and ranged from 3 pounds , one ounce to three pounds , 11 ounces in weight			2
' the boy was such a gentleman - he opened the door and let all the girls come first , ' perinatologist dr. @entity46 told @entity50			2
the newborns are now receiving care at the hospital 's neonatal intensive care unit , where they are using respiratory support but otherwise healthy			0
they will stay at the hospital until they are big enough to go home , doctors said without giving a date			0
welcome ! the babies ' big brother named them based on the alphabet , starting with @entity23 , pictured sleeping beauty : next came @entity24 , who , like her siblings , still remains in hospital using breathing equipment tiny : @entity25 is pictured			1
the couple already have a ' c ' in the family - their six - year - old son @entity19 ' little gentleman ' : @entity26 allowed his four sisters to come out before he was born , doctors said new addition : @entity27 , pictured , was born just in time to wish her dad a happy @entity4 at a press conference , the couple said their six - year - old son had been shocked by the number of new arrivals			1
bump : mrs @entity5 grins as she shows off her massive bump ahead of the quintuplets ' birth ' he 's like , " oh no , i 've got four sisters now i have to watch after			1
they 're going to drive me crazy " , ' mr @entity9 said			2
' but he 's a good little boy and if he wants to or not , he 's going to be a great help			0
' mrs @entity5 gave birth to the babies after 31 weeks and one day ; the national average gestation for quintuplets is 28 weeks			1
she had undergone fertility treatment after the couple struggled to conceive following @entity19 's birth and suffering a miscarriage			1
they visited a fertility specialist in @entity16 between may and september 2013 and were diagnosed with unexplained infertility			2
in november , mrs @entity5 started receiving medications and underwent @entity102 - and they were stunned to discover they were expecting five babies , she wrote on her blog			1
' my husband was pale white , mouth open , and was in complete shock , ' she said			0
' when we walked out of the ultrasound room and sat in the waiting area to talk with the doctor , other patients kept looking at him and asking if he was okay			0
his only response was , " there 's five " ! ' i just kept explaining to the other patient 's who were waiting what he meant			0
needless to say , i think he gave the entire waiting room a scare !

the babies will return home when they are big enough she added : ' the fertility doctors kept apologizing to us , said they did not know how this happened			2
they urged us to strongly consider selective reduction with this very high - risk pregnancy			0
' but the couple , who met in the military , decided to keep the five babies and chose the @entity12 hospital after hearing about dr @entity148 , a perinatologist and multiple - birth specialist			0
' without this team here , they would n't have made it this far and they definitely would n't have been this healthy , ' @entity9 said			0

@entity5 and @entity9 , from @entity16 , welcomed four girls and one boy at @entity11 in @entity13 on friday
their son @entity19 named them @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27
