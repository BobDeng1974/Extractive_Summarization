by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 19:32 est , 12 april 2013 lord @entity1 last night launched a scathing attack on @entity4 winner @entity4 after she lost a constructive dismissal claim against him , saying ‘ she picked the wrong person ’			1
the multi-millionaire heralded the tribunal ’s decision as a victory against @entity13 ’s compensation culture , and vowed to begin a personal crusade against ‘ ambulance - chasing lawyers ’			1
lord @entity1 branded miss @entity16 , 34 , a ‘ money - grabber ’ and a ‘ chancer ’ , claiming she had launched a sham case against him in the hope he would pay out to avoid an embarrassing confrontation in court			1
he added : ‘ this case was a sham and a total abuse of a tribunal system which is there to protect employees who have been mistreated			1
it is not there to aid those chancing their arm at landing a big payday			0
‘ i hope that other companies will learn from this example and also fight off derisory claims			0
’ winner : @entity4 ( front , centre ) with the other female @entity55 contestants in 2010 - the year she won the @entity57 show victory : @entity4 beat rival @entity59 in the 2010 final of the show but she said the job was not what she hoped lord @entity1 , 66 , said the allegations against him were ‘ tantamount to blackmail ’ , adding : ‘ i ’m afraid she underestimated me and her reputation is now in tatters			1
’ @entity4 was known on @entity68 as the ' ice maiden ' due to her cool demeanour , but wept when she found out she had won a £ 100,000 contract with @entity1			1
the mother - of - two had given up her job in banking after progressing in the sixth series of the @entity57 show but stressed that all the hard work had been worth it when she beat 15 others to win the talent search			1
she was tearful as she thanked @entity1 for offering her a job , having been described by the peer as ' well - liked and determined to get on with whatever you 're asked to do '			2
the 34 - year - old , who left school with no qualifications , said on the @entity57 after winning that the challenge had been ' convincing other people '			1
in the interview , conducted in the back of a chauffeur - driven car , she said : ' i 'm so excited about the future			0
it 's all been worth it			0
all the blood , sweat and tears			0
i 've got through to the end and i 'm just so happy			0
' months later , the cracks were starting to appear however when she started work at it firm @entity103 , a position she ended up stepping down from before then joining television set - top box company @entity106			0
lord @entity1 had praised miss @entity16 on the show for showing determination , noting her background and the fact she had fought to educate herself			1
miss @entity16 was brought up by relatives on a council estate and then worked her way up the career ladder to an £ 82,500 - a - year job in a @entity118 investment bank before applying to take part in @entity68			1
the tribunal heard miss @entity16 is currently working in it , but in interviews she has spoken of plans to launch her own fashion range of business clothing			0
she lives with her sons and husband in @entity128 , @entity129			0
in a unanimous written judgment , the tribunal panel said : ‘ this was a claim which should never have been brought			2
’ @entity68 star ’s tirade marked the end of a bitter legal battle between him and miss @entity16 , who won the hit @entity139 show in 2010			0
her prize was a £ 100,000 job in one of @entity1 ’s subsidiary companies , but she walked away from the year - long contract after just five months , claiming she was used as ‘ an overpaid lackey ’			1
the mother - of - two , who gave up a £ 82,500 salary in the @entity151 to go on @entity68 , said her new colleagues shunned her because she was recruited through the tv show			1
on her first day at work she claimed she was told : ‘ the cameras have stopped rolling now … welcome to the real world , there is no job			0
’ miss @entity4 said she felt ostracised while she worked at @entity103 , which supplies it equipment to schools , universities and hospitals			2
far from being mentored by @entity1 , she said she only saw him five times while she worked there			2
miss @entity4 told the tribunal that when she asked @entity1 for feedback , he replied : ‘ the feedback is : “ nice girl , do n’t do a lot ”			1
’ during a confrontation over her role , she claimed @entity1 told her : ‘ i ’ve met my obligations to you			2
‘ i did it for the @entity57 and the integrity of the show and a bit of my own pr and a bit of yours too			0
but the fact is that i do n’t give a s * * *			0
’ lord @entity1 denied her claims and yesterday the @entity186 employment tribunal dismissed miss @entity16 ’s case , saying there was no evidence to support her allegation that she was unfairly treated			1
contestants in the show were warned @entity1 would not be their line manager and that they would rarely see him , the three - strong panel ruled			2
miss @entity16 was given ‘ a real job ’ but resigned after discovering the reality of working in the tycoon ’s empire , it said			0
miss @entity16 , who lives in @entity128 , @entity129 , with her husband @entity201 , was unavailable for comment			0
@entity201 , now a builder , was a notorious hardman linked to @entity204 , the gangster father of @entity205 , one of the convicted killers of @entity205			0
apprentice : lord @entity1 with @entity208 and @entity209			1
@entity4 won the 2010 version of the show testing relationship : ms @entity4 had to carry out a four - month probationary period before she was eventually named the winner of the show in december 2010 lord @entity1 was defiant as he gave evidence in the employment tribunal and was vindicated today when the panel rejected ms @entity4 's claim he styles himself as @entity13 's most belligerent boss and is known for his ruthless grilling of contestants on @entity68			1
but when a former winner of the television show decided to sue @entity1 , he was the one facing questions for a change			2
lord @entity1 's no - nonsense style is now familiar to thousands of television viewers thanks to the reality series which started in 2005			1
it spawned the catchphrases ' you 're fired ! ' and ' you 're hired ! ' - the latter of which he said to 2010 winner @entity4 , who is the first of the show 's contestants to take @entity1 to an employment tribunal			1
before the cameras started rolling , @entity1 had been a businessman for decades			2
the @entity242 boy started off selling electrical goods from the back of a van and then founded @entity246 in 1968 , which later went into manufacturing			0
he stepped down as chairman of the firm , which now sells set - top boxes , in 2008			0
the @entity253 peer currently has a string of businesses under his belt			0
they include advertising brand @entity258 , private air travel firm @entity260 and property firms @entity262 - the ' @entity264 ' prefix representing his initials @entity1			2
he stepped down as chairman of @entity106 , the television catch - up service that employed ms @entity4 after she left lord @entity1 's it company @entity103 , earlier this year			1
more recently , he has also invested in products dreamed up by winners of @entity68 , as the format has changed since miss @entity16 won the show			0
that fact explains why @entity1 , a fan of social media , can often be found extolling the virtues of the s - shaped nail file created by series winner @entity276 on @entity33			1
outside the world of business , @entity1 has been involved in several spats with high - profile figures on @entity33 - and most recently took offence at followers who tweeted " foul - mouth comments " on his tribute to @entity286 , describing them as ' despicable scum '			1
last year he angered @entity287 , star of the @entity289 version of @entity68 , when he told him that ' @entity290 do n't want wind turbines ' and ' the @entity290 do n't want you ! '			0
@entity287 replied by saying @entity1 ' should not be doing @entity68 ' , and added : ' without my show you 'd be nothing ! ' he also engaged in a war of words with x factor judge @entity298 , after firing off the missive : ' this @entity298 talks nonsense on x factor , what qualifications does she have to judge singing talent			2
please advise where i am missing the point			0
" the @entity307 singer replied by telling @entity1 : ' as someone that came from nothing to something maybe u should have a little more respect for people that have done the same			2
' in his personal life , lord @entity1 is an ardent @entity318 fan , and used to be chairman of the club			1
he collects @entity322 and @entity323 cars - one bearing the personalised number plate @entity324 is married with three children and is reportedly worth £ 770 million .			0

lord @entity1 says it as ' a victory for the law against the claim culture ' in @entity33
he says it was a ' derisory attempt to smear my name and *extract* money '
@entity338 says the case was an ' abuse of the tribunal system ' and vows to take the issue up in @entity343
ms @entity4 , 34 , was not unfairly dismissed from her job , tribunal rules
mother - of - two said she was an ' overpaid lackey ' in her £ 100,000 - a - year job
' this was a claim that should never have been brought , ' says tribunal judge
