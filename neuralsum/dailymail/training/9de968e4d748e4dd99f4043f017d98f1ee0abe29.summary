by @entity0 @entity2 captain @entity1 will miss next month 's one - day international series against @entity4 because of the hamstring injury which ruled him out of much of the recent tour to @entity7			1
@entity9 physiotherapist @entity8 has explained @entity1 's injury is more serious than first hoped , and the 33 - year - old batsman must therefore sit out the @entity13 leg of his team 's final tour - to be played in the @entity16 - before they host the @entity18 next winter			0
@entity8 said : ' since returning to @entity2 , @entity1 has had a series of investigations that have confirmed a significant hamstring injury			0

' as such , he will not recover in time to be available for the @entity23 in the @entity16			0
' we hope he will be available for the @entity35 series , but this will be determined at a date closer to the first test			2

@entity1 missed out on recent tour to @entity7 with *problem*
@entity2 captain is to be rested with the hope of playing in @entity18
@entity1 may be available for the @entity35 series
