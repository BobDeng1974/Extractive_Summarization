by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 13:56 est , 14 february 2013 a 16 stone woman shed half her body weight after a male masseur asked her if she was pregnant while on holiday			1
@entity5 , 23 , had always been overweight and was known as ' the bubbly and cuddly one ' by her friends at school			2
but one embarrassing summer holiday in @entity9 made her determined to shed the excess pounds			1
@entity5 during the life - changing holiday in @entity9 ( l ) and slimmed down today ( r )			1
she is now a keen runner in june 2009 , @entity5 joined her mother @entity13 , 45 and friend on holiday to @entity16			1
on the first day of the holiday the girls decided to treat themselves to a traditional @entity9 bath and massage at their hotel			1
@entity5 , at 5ft 2in and a dress size 22 , was a little anxious about having to strip down to her underwear , but was left red faced and humiliated after the masseur ridiculed her over her size			1
' the masseur told me to take my clothes off so i stripped down to my underwear , ' she said			0
' the first thing he did was point to my stomach and said " baby ? "			0
i was gob smacked , and told him " no , definitely not "			0
' he then said again " baby ? " while making belly shapes with his hands on his own stomach			0
" determined effort : @entity5 during her 5k charity run in june 2010			1
she had slimmed down from a size 22 to a size 16 by this point			1
today she is a super-fit size 8 then the masseur started to tease @entity5 telling her that she should not have a protruding belly , and while pinching and wobbling her fat throughout the massage told her that it was unnatural			1
' he said to me " what 's this ? this should n't be here			0
" ' during the whole massage he was talking and joking to his mates in @entity9 and they were all laughing at me , it was really demoralising			2
' @entity5 with her boyfriend @entity59 , 26 , in 2012 , back in @entity9 after slimming down @entity5 spent the remainder of the holiday covered up , too self conscious to wear anything remotely revealing in risk of further ridicule			1
then one night back at home in @entity66 , @entity5 looked back through her holiday pictures with disgust			1
' i looked at myself in the photographs and said , " i have to change "			0
' i saw myself smiling , but i did n't look happy , there was a sadness around me			0
' the next day @entity5 joined a gym and decided to give herself a target to motivate her weight - loss			1
she set a date to run the @entity77 in june 2010 and began going to the gym three times a week , ditching her junk food diet to get into shape			1
at first @entity5 , who works as a personnel officer at @entity82 could barely run 30 seconds , let alone 5k , and was embarrassed at how loud her running was on the treadmill			1
but when she swapped the greasy takeaways and ready meals for chicken and vegetables , she soon increased her energy levels and was able to run over an hour in the gym			2
within six months she had already lost an impressive four stone			0
her old diet consisted of toast with big dollops of @entity94 layered on top for breakfast , a chocolate bar and hot chocolate for a mid-morning snack , a big baguette with crisps and a fizzy drink for lunch			0
in the afternoon , she tucked into biscuits , while dinner was a takeaway or ready meal with chips for dinner , as well as the occasional whole pot of @entity112 's ice cream			0
but now @entity5 eats a diet of oats with water and a scoop of whey protein for breakfast , @entity120 yoghurt , white fish with vegetables and chicken with spinach and sweet potatoes			2
in june 2010 , on her 21st birthday , she completed the @entity77 in just 35 minutes and immediately gave herself another goal - a half marathon the following year in april 2011 - which she also completed in 1 hour and 53 minutes			1
now @entity5 is a svelte size 8 and super fit			1
@entity5 in 2007 when she was a size 18 to 20			1
she said she had always been known as the ' cuddly one ' she said : ' i now train six days a week , doing around one hour cardiovascular exercise plus weight training which targets specific muscle groups			2
it takes an awful lot of self - discipline			0
' however , as i have lost such a large amount of weight i have a small amount of spare skin on my lower abdomen which will need to be removed through surgery before i can compete			0
' joining the gym also helped @entity5 find love with fellow fitness fanatic , bodybuilder partner @entity149 , 26 , who works in car production			2
' @entity59 , is a huge source of motivation for me			0
' i knew him from when i was a bit younger and he was a close friend of my brothers , but i hid away from him back then			0
' we came to know each other more during 2011 and would always talk about the gym and fitness as it was a shared interest			0
' we got together officially in january 2012 and it has been the happiest year of my life so far			0
we train together quite often and we have a very similar diet as he is also a body builder			0
' looking back at who she was just a few years ago @entity5 said : ' if some would have said i 'd look like this back then , i would have said ' no chance '			2
' looking back , i ironically have a lot to thank that @entity9 masseur , as he inspired me to change my life			2
he did me the biggest favour			0
' now @entity5 hopes to compete in the @entity172 and @entity174 's bikini category later on this year .			2

@entity5 , was teased by a masseuse while on holiday in @entity9 in 2009 about her size 22 shape
it made her determined to slim and she ditched takeaways for *healthy* meals
by 2010 she was a size 16 and ran a 5k . by 2011 she ran a half - marathon
she is now a size 8 and trains six times a week
