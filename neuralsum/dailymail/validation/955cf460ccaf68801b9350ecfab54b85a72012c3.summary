today 's long awaited report into @entity2 's surveilance powers was sparked by the @entity4 revelations @entity5 was last night cleared of carrying out mass surveillance of the public using vast trawls of internet traffic			1
the @entity10 said the central claims made by the @entity13 newspaper on the back of documents stolen by @entity16 whistle - blower @entity4 were wrong and it cleared the government ’s listening station of wrongdoing			1
after an 18 - month inquiry , the committee dismissed the claims that @entity5 had ‘ blanket coverage ’ of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages			1
in reality , it said , @entity5 can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a ‘ tiny fraction ’ of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process			1
the committee concluded that the only items seen by analysts were those of the ‘ highest intelligence value ’ , and these amounted to several thousand a day			2
@entity39 mp @entity38 , a member of the committee , said : ‘ the big mistake that @entity4 and the @entity13 made in its coverage was to equate bulk data with bulk surveillance			1
‘ the truth is that the filtering process means that a tiny proportion of the bulk data that is collected is ever examined			2
‘ that point was never really made by the @entity13 , who gave the impression that with every phone call , every email and every text message , the public had a spy on their shoulder			0
’ @entity60 mp @entity59 said the ‘ two main claims ’ made off the back of the @entity4 leaks were untrue and surveillance was neither blanket nor indiscriminate			0
‘ what we ’ve found is that the way in which the agencies use the capabilities they have is authorised , lawful , necessary and proportionate			2
@entity60 mp @entity59 chaired the press conference on the @entity10 's long - awaited report into @entity2 's spy agencies @entity75 , based in @entity76 , is the government 's main listening post and is allowed to monitor people 's ' communications ' to uncover terror threats ‘ but what we ’ve also found is there is a degree of confusion and lack of transparency about the way in which this is authorised in our legal system			1
' it is that lack of transparency that leads to people reaching the conclusion that there is blanket surveillance , indiscriminate surveillance			0
’ another committee member , @entity39 mp dr @entity98 , compared the process to using a magnet to pull a needle from a haystack			2
the agency does not have the ‘ legal authority , the resources or the technical capability ’ to intercept such vast amounts of material , the report concluded			0
the committee recommended a new law bringing together all the intelligence and security legislation			2
' the allegation arising from the [ @entity4 ] leaks is that @entity5 ‘ hoover up ’ and collect all internet communications			1
some of those who gave evidence to this inquiry said ‘ the agencies are monitoring the whole stream all the time ’ , referring to the ‘ apparent ubiquity of surveillance ’			0
' we have explored whether this is the case			0
it is clear that both for legal reasons and due to resource constraints , it is not : @entity5 can not conduct indiscriminate blanket interception of all communications			1
‘ it would be unlawful for them to do so , since it would not be necessary or proportionate , as required by [ the @entity134 ]			0
moreover , @entity5 do not have the capacity to do so and can only cover a fraction of internet communications ' @entity2 's spy agencies have to get a warrant to monitor an individual 's emails , phone calls and other communications			1
the warrants are signed off by the foreign secretary @entity145 ( left ) or home secretary @entity146 ( right ) @entity147 , director of rights campaign group @entity148 , said the parliamentary committee was ' clueless and ineffective ' councils were given more authorisations to access private communications data last year than @entity5 and @entity155 , it emerged last night			1
town halls accessed records of telephone , text or internet use 2,110 times last year , the interception of @entity157 said			0
that compares to 1,291 approvals for @entity5 and 652 for @entity155			1
@entity165 , which makes the vast bulk of such applications , was given 48,639 authorisations last year			1
councils can use the powers to investigate fly tipping , benefit fraud , and trading standards ‘ crimes ’			0
communities secretary @entity174 said : ‘ the use by some town halls seems excessive – as if they were acting out their @entity179 fantasies			0
i would encourage the press and public to investigate their actions further on why use is so high			0
‘ there is also a case for further tightening of these municipal snooping powers			2
’ @entity4 , who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in @entity191 , released 1.7million files in one of the biggest security leaks in @entity16 history			0
he fled to @entity196 , where he was granted asylum			0
@entity147 , director of human rights group @entity148 , condemned the report , adding : ‘ no doubt it would be simpler if we went along with the spies ’ motto of “ no scrutiny for us , no privacy for you ” – but what an appalling deal for the @entity2 public			1
’ a @entity13 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity4 revelations provoked a global debate about the role of intelligence and surveillance in the free world , and the extent to which it should be the subject of democratic and judicial oversight			0
following the recent @entity221 ruling , it is now clear that the @entity5 and @entity223 mass surveillance programmes revealed by @entity4 were illegal			2

agents at @entity5 monitor ' large numbers of items ' to uncover terror threats
spies use ' bulk interception ' powers to track down terrorists such as @entity234
@entity10 said @entity2 spies were not breaking law
@entity5 was not ' collecting or reading everyone 's emails ' , committee said
but it is ' *unavoidable* that some innocent communications ' are snooped on
spies at @entity5 , @entity165 and @entity155 have been sacked for ' *inappropriate* ' snooping
spies have been sacked for *misusing* a vast computer system containing millions of pieces of *personal* data about @entity2 citizens . the committee found that @entity165 , @entity5 and @entity155 had all disciplined – and in some cases sacked – operatives for *unapproved* access .
