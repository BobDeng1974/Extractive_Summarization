@entity0 have retained @entity1 highlights at a fair price after rivals @entity3 conceded it was not worth competing for the rights			1
@entity3 ’s decision was a surprise after being widely tipped to make a bid during the tender process			2
but memories remain of the blunders made by @entity3 when they had the highlights from 2001 - 04			1
screening the show in the early evening and having match analysts operating from the much - derided ‘ @entity14 ’ were innovations that failed to score with viewers			0
the @entity0 will keep @entity17 highlights on its @entity1 programme after @entity3 failed to bid @entity19 is pictured presenting an episode of the @entity0 's @entity1 @entity19 delivers the news to his @entity23 followers on thursday afternoon @entity3 ’s decision not to compete allows the @entity24 to keep their flagship programme at a cost of £ 204million over three years — an increase of little more than £ 24m over their previous three - year deal			1
it is also far less than the mooted price of a winning bid if @entity3 had been fully engaged			2
only @entity34 tennis ranks higher in @entity0 ’s portfolio so their delight is perhaps understandable			0
it is also a timely boost with the @entity24 expecting to lose live rights for @entity41 golf to @entity42 in the near future			0
pay - tv networks will be offered the chance to bid for another of the @entity0 ’s top three properties , @entity49 rugby , from 2018			2
and @entity0 keeping hold of one of their crown jewels means it ’s also likely that @entity19 will stay at the corporation for the duration of the next contract that runs for three seasons from 2016 - 17 onwards			1
@entity19 , however , whose @entity24 contract expires in 2016 might still present @entity66 ’s @entity65 coverage from next season – if his @entity0 deal that currently gives them exclusivity for @entity62 in the domestic market can be re-negotiated			1
former @entity69 striker @entity68 is one of the programme 's regular pundits the flagship @entity0 football highlights programme started broadcasting back in 1964 @entity3 deciding not to enter the highlights auction is also strange considering they axed @entity75 last week as their lead football presenter with immediate effect - replacing him with @entity77 in what was seen as a clear move to get a football revamp sorted before the highlights auction			1
the @entity17 are still guaranteed to get a significant lift in their terrestrial highlights package as nothing about @entity3 not bidding would have come out before the @entity0 put in their offer			1
however the rights were retained for £ 204m and the @entity0 have done well to keep them for that amount if they were n’t aware @entity3 had n’t bid			1
they had been expected to fetch at least £ 250m compared to the £ 180m paid by the @entity0 last time			2
this season @entity3 - @entity69 internationals , @entity65 , @entity95 @entity96 - @entity17 , @entity65 , other home nations internationals , @entity98 , @entity99 @entity0 - @entity17 highlights , @entity100 , @entity99 highlights @entity66 - @entity17 , @entity100 , @entity95 2015 - 16 season @entity3 - @entity69 international games , @entity65 and @entity95 highlights @entity96 - @entity17 , other home nations internationals , @entity98 , @entity99 @entity0 - @entity17 highlights , @entity100 @entity66 - @entity17 , @entity100 , @entity65 , @entity95 @entity0 football presenter @entity104 ( centre ) flanked by pundits @entity107 ( left ) and @entity108 the agreement covers the saturday night edition of @entity1 , its sunday morning repeat , @entity112 , @entity113 on sunday nights and a new midweek magazine show to air on @entity0 at 10pm on wednesday night			1
under the new deal , the saturday night show will be available on the iplayer on demand service for the first time			0
a @entity0 statement read : ' the new midweek programme will review and preview the weekend ’s action with all the latest @entity17 news , going behind the scenes at @entity17 clubs , and bringing interviews with managers , players and those who have made their mark on the league ’s illustrious history			1
' @entity134 , director of @entity0 said : ' we ’re delighted to retain the rights to show @entity17 highlights on the @entity0 , and continue to bring the most popular league in the world to our audiences			1
@entity1 is the most iconic brand in television sport , and we work hard to ensure that it continues to be the destination for millions of viewers each weekend across platforms			0
' it ’s very exciting to be able to add a new midweek show to the mix , reflecting the continued appetite for @entity17 action and analysis			0
' @entity1 pundits @entity150 and @entity68 during an episode last season @entity0 director general @entity153 added : ' sport matters			2
it brings the nation together			0
it can break hearts and raise spirits			0
and because it matters to the public , it also matters to the @entity0			0
' that ’s why it ’s fantastic news that we have kept the @entity17 highlights			2
' it ’s the best and most exciting league in the world			0
the @entity0 has made the highlights programme , through @entity1 , a national treasure , and fans can look forward to enjoying all the drama with us for another three years			1
' @entity1 , the iconic @entity0 football highlights programme , was first screened on @entity176 on august 22 , 1964 and featured coverage of just one match , the first division fixture between @entity180 and @entity181 at @entity182			1
the programme 's audience was estimated at a mere 20,000 - less than half the attendance at the ground - because not many households could receive the @entity176 channel , set up four months earlier			2
it was not the first time the @entity0 had broadcast football - live matches had been shown since 1958 - but a new tradition of saturday night highlights was born			1
match of the day was broadcast on @entity176 for the first year of its existence the top division clubs initially had objections , fearing the promise of evening highlights would impact on gates at the ground , and so the @entity0 reached a compromise whereby they would n't reveal which match they would show until after the day 's play had concluded			2
this arrangement remained in place until 1983			0
the programme proved so popular , it was switched over to @entity208 in 1965 , and has remained there ever since			0
the first @entity1 broadcast in colour was on november 15 , 1969 for the game between @entity180 and @entity212			0
slow motion replays were introduced in 1971 but the @entity0 's monopoly on @entity17 highlights was being challenged by @entity3 , who started showing sunday afternoon highlights in the regions in 1968			1
the @entity0 responded to ' @entity219 ' over on their rival station by showing a second game on @entity1			2
@entity222 presents an episode of @entity1 during the seventies in 1979 , a new four - year deal saw rights split between @entity0 and @entity3 , and for two seasons in the early eighties , @entity1 occupied a new sunday afternoon slot before reverting back in 1983			1
worse was to follow in 1988 , when the @entity0 lost all rights for @entity17 football to @entity3 , meaning the @entity1 name continued purely with @entity100 highlights			1
when @entity69 's leading clubs broke away to form the @entity17 in 1992 , the @entity24 seized the chance to get back the highlights with @entity42 taking up exclusive live coverage			1
for the first time , @entity1 showed highlights from three games plus the goals from the other matches for the first time			0
commentator @entity244 on the mic during a @entity1 broadcast between @entity247 and @entity180 a @entity1 camera crew at @entity249 for a match between @entity247 and @entity180 @entity17 highlights have been on the @entity0 for the entire @entity17 era with the exception of 2001 - 2004 , when @entity3 launched ' the @entity17 '			1
their idea to bring saturday night highlights to an earlier time backfired and ratings were poor			0
when the @entity0 picked up the baton again , they started showing highlights from every game with a commentator at each ground			0
the famous theme song was written especially for the programme by @entity265 in 1970			0
previously , the intro had been ' @entity267 ' , written by @entity268 , the band leader of the @entity269			0
@entity265 's rather vague brief was to write ' something good ' and he came up with a theme that is one of the most recognisable in the @entity274			0
@entity275 @entity265 wrote the iconic @entity1 theme tune back in 1970			0

@entity0 retain @entity278 highlights
@entity3 did not bid for 2016 - 2019 highlights packages
@entity0 's flagship @entity1 programme is marking its 50th year
auction for live @entity17 rights will be held next month
presenter @entity19 is expected to remain at the @entity0
but he is likely to still front @entity66 's @entity65 coverage
deal *includes* a new wednesday night magazine - style programme
