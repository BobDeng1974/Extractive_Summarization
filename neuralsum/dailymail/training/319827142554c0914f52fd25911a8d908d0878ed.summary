@entity1 coach @entity0 has warned that players may hallucinate during sunday ’s @entity3 last - 16 game with @entity5 if @entity6 do not allow both teams the opportunity to take on water			1
it is expected to be around 35 degrees when the teams take the field in @entity13 at 1pm local time			1
‘ this is why we have trained so hard — so weather conditions wo n’t be the opponent for us , ’ said @entity15			1
cooling off : the team stop for a drink in the scorching conditions they will face in sunday 's last - 16 clash lining one up : @entity15 getting stuck in with the ball at his feet ‘ i will call a spade a spade if i am not happy , though			1
we are open about it and can prepare for it			2
‘ if we have to , we will take drinks and put bottles round the pitch			2
it is extremely important and that is why a dehydration element was included in training and friendlies			0
‘ every player will become dehydrated			0
some lose four litres during the game			0
‘ they have to replenish otherwise they will start hallucinating			0
we just hope that the water is ready and that the referee does his job in a sensible way			0
’ both @entity1 and @entity5 were forced to train elsewhere yesterday because @entity6 deemed the pitch at @entity52 unable to cope with two practice sessions and a match in two days			1
embrace : @entity0 puts an arm around his captain @entity56 ‘ the humidity is so high it will affect the match , ’ added @entity15			1
‘ that is the reason we tried to get the players as fit as possible			0
it will affect @entity5 , but they are more used to it			2

@entity1 face @entity5 in @entity13 on sunday
*temperatures* are *forecast* to be around 35 degrees
