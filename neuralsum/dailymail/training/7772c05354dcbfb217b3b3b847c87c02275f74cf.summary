by @entity0 for @entity1 a toddler who suffered six cardiac arrests before his first birthday has made a miraculous recovery thanks to a pioneering operation			1
one - year - old @entity7 was born three months prematurely with a severe heart condition that left him fighting for his life			1
after suffering six cardiac arrests - four of them at just two hours old – doctors performed an operation that had never before been carried out on a baby so small			1
after 22 weeks in hospital @entity7 has recovered and is now at home with his family in @entity16 , @entity17			2
@entity7 , one , of @entity16 , @entity17 has recovered after suffering six cardiac arrests before his first birthday due to congenital heart disease doctors at the @entity20 in @entity21 were unable to give @entity7 's parents survival odds as the surgery he needed to widen his artery had not been performed there before on babies so young it took @entity27 , 37 , and her husband @entity28 eight years to conceive @entity7 with @entity30 treatment			1
at the 20 - week scan she was told her baby had a heart condition and would need surgery as soon as he was born			1
but , she said that did not prepare her for what happened when her son was born			0
she said : ‘ when @entity7 was born it felt like a nightmare - it was so surreal			2
‘ a doctor explained to us that he ’d suffered four cardiac arrests , and they did n’t know how long they could keep resuscitating him			1
‘ we could n’t believe it - four cardiac arrests - it was horrifying			2
‘ after i gave birth my husband and i just had to sit for two hours and wait to find out if our baby was alive			0
’ but i just remember thinking that this was n’t going to be how our story ended			0
’ @entity7 was diagnosed with congenital heart disease in the womb			1
he was born with two holes in his heart and a narrowing of the aorta , the main artery in the body			1
mrs @entity27 said : ' when @entity7 was born if felt like a nightmare - it was so surreal			0
my husband and i just had to sit for two hours and wait to find out if our baby was alive ' @entity27 and @entity63 cried and hugged each other in the street when they found out son @entity7 had survived an emergency operation to widen his artery			2
he is pictured right with one of his surgeons the narrow artery meant @entity7 ’s tiny heart was under too much pressure to pump blood around the body , causing him to go into cardiac arrest			1
after being born at the family ’s local hospital , @entity7 was transferred to @entity20 , a specialist heart and lung hospital in @entity21			1
it was decided he needed an operation to widen his artery , but this type of surgery was not normally carried out on babies so small			2
after initial scans , doctors there said the problem did n’t appear to be too severe , so they sent him back to the local hospital to grow bigger			0
but @entity7 began to go downhill , having yet another cardiac arrest , and sent straight back to @entity20			1
his small size was still an issue , and so once again it was decided to wait until he grew bigger before he would have the operation , but he was struggling to gain weight			0
as @entity7 ’s condition became worse , doctors were forced to operate			0
mrs @entity27 said she was petrified , as doctors were not able to say whether @entity7 was likely to survive			0
she said : ‘ the anaesthetist at the time said they could n’t give us any survival odds as they did n’t have any for the type of operation on a baby so small			0
‘ we were told the words that no parent ever wants to hear - they might not be able to bring our precious baby back			0
mrs @entity27 said : ' that day @entity7 broke @entity20 history and opened up new pathways for pioneering surgery to be performed on tiny babies in the future ’ the @entity7 family are raising money for a £ 4.5 million state - of - the - art operating theatre for the @entity20 in @entity21 , where @entity7 received the surgery that saved his life ‘ waiting for the phone call to tell us whether he had survived the operation was truly one of the worst times of our lives			1
' she describes the feeling of joy when she found out @entity7 had survived			0
she said : ‘ but we were delighted when we were told that @entity7 had pulled through - we were crying and hugging each other in the middle of the street			0
‘ that day @entity7 broke @entity20 history and opened up new pathways for pioneering surgery to be performed on tiny babies in the future			1
’ unfortunately , scans after the operation showed that @entity7 ’s problem had returned and he would need further surgery			2
twelve weeks later , @entity7 had finally grown bigger , and the second surgery was performed - and this time it was successful			0
donor tissue was placed into @entity7 ’s heart to make a bigger pathway allowing the blood to flow to the rest of his body without being obstructed			1
they tiny holes in his heart were also fixed			0
once again , waiting for her son to come out of surgery was terrifying for mrs @entity27 and her husband			0
she said : ‘ eight very , very long hours later they brought our little hero back from surgery and yet again he had been amazing			0
‘ he was very poorly afterwards - and suffered yet another cardiac arrest a few days later - we could n’t believe he ’d had yet another one ! ‘ but once again he took it all in his stride			1
’ after 19 weeks in intensive care @entity7 finally began to improve and doctors began to allow him to breathe for himself			0
@entity7 was born with two holes in his heart and a narrowing of the aorta , the main artery in the body mrs @entity27 said she was ‘ over the moon ’ , when she was finally able to take @entity7 home 22 weeks after he was born			1
she added : ‘ walking through the door of our home , with no machines , nurses , or doctors , was the scariest thing ever			0
‘ but a year on , he ’s doing amazingly well - he ’s strong willed and determined , as he has always been ! she is now raising money for the hospital ’s charity to open a new state - of - the - art operating theatre			1
she thanks the hospital for their help at a truly difficult time			0
she said : ‘ the @entity20 has been fantastic and we ca n’t thank the staff enough - not only did they look after @entity7 but they looked after us too			2
‘ we met so many amazing people there , it is a truly inspirational place			0
‘ the charity needs £ 4.5 million in total , but we ’re determined to do our bit - they saved our son ’s life , and we could n’t be happier			1

unless someone starts cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( @entity199 ) the person may suffer permanent damage to the brain and other organs a cardiac arrest happens when your heart stops pumping blood around the body			1
if you have a cardiac arrest , you lose consciousness almost at once			2
there are also no other signs of life such as breathing or movement			0
this is an emergency and if you witness a cardiac arrest you should call 999 immediately			2
what is the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest ? a cardiac arrest is different from a heart attack			1
most heart attacks are caused by coronary heart disease			0
if you have a heart attack , it does not always lead to a cardiac arrest			2
a cardiac arrest does not always happen because you have a heart condition			1
if you witness a cardiac arrest , you can increase the person ’s chances of survival by phoning 999 and giving immediate cpr			2
treating a cardiac arrest unless someone starts cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( @entity199 ) the person may suffer permanent damage to the brain and other organs			2
ambulance staff are trained in advanced resuscitation and all emergency ambulances carry a defibrillator			0
what causes a cardiac arrest ? the most common cause of a cardiac arrest is a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation ( @entity254 )			1
ventricular fibrillation occurs when the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers or ' fibrillates ' instead			0

@entity7 , one , was born with a congenital heart condition
born with two holes in his heart and a narrowing of the aorta
his tiny heart could *n't* pump blood around the body leading to cardiac arrest
he suffered six cardiac arrests before his first birthday
surgery carried out at @entity20 in @entity21 saved his life
@entity282 had never carried out this type of operation on a baby before
family are *fundraising* for a £ 4.5 million operating theatre for hospital
