a student has created a tiny working camera out of a @entity3 brick			1
graphic design student @entity4 , 21 , made a fully functional pinhole camera , which creates tiny photographic prints , housed in the space of the small toy block			1
the @entity3 fan 's tiny camera takes minuscule black and white photographs measuring 0.16 square inches ( one square centimetre square )			1
the camera is seen here in @entity4 's hand			2
the graphic design student created the working pinhole camera out of a single @entity3 brick mr @entity4 , a student at @entity20 , said : ' you can make a pinhole camera out of nearly anything			1
' i love @entity3 - you can do so much with it			0
' a pinhole camera is a camera without a lens			2
it has a small hole in one side that acts as an aperture to let in light			0
when you point the camera at an object , light from the object travels through the hole and projects an inverted image on the film along the opposite side of the box			2
this technique is similar to how eyes see and process images			0
the smaller the hole , the sharper the image , yet the dimmer it will appear			0
a pinhole camera 's shutter is manually operated by a flap of card , for example			2
the @entity3 camera works by exposing a sheet of photographic paper to light from a tiny pinprick			1
light comes in the side and strikes the photographic film , creating an image			1
the paper can then be developed in exactly the same way as a full - size photograph			0
the camera , which can be held by a @entity3 figure , is made of a black two - by - two lego brick , a sheet of brass with a hole in the middle , and is sealed using black tape			1
mr @entity4 said : ' the pictures are a little bit fuzzy but people are impressed by it			1
' ' the hardest part about building it is removing the central supporting column inside the brick - you have to use a dremel [ tool ] to get it out			0
' i usually expose the pinhole for around ten seconds to get the images			0
' mr @entity4 was inspired by a working pinhole camera made from a pine nut			1
his @entity3 creation only took 20 minutes to build			0
here a @entity3 man is seen with the @entity3 camera and pictures taken with it			2
@entity4 from @entity20 made the tiny camera in just 20 minutes ' the pictures are a little bit fuzzy but people are impressed by it , ' said @entity4			1

@entity4 from @entity20 has made a tiny camera
using a @entity3 brick he made the minuscule pinhole camera
light comes into the brick and the creates an image on photographic film
these ' photos ' measure just 0.16 inches square ( one centimetre square )
' the pictures are a little bit fuzzy but people are impressed by it , ' he said
