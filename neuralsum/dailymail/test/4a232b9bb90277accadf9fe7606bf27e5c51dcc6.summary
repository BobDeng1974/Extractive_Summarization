@entity0 goaded his vanquished rival @entity1 after @entity2 stunned @entity3 to steal a 1 - 0 @entity5 semi-final triumph at @entity6			1
@entity7 claimed that @entity1 should be examining tactical failings that led to the downfall of @entity3 rather than highlighting @entity2 ’s fortune on the day			1
the broadside was in response to @entity1 insisting it ’s @entity3 who fully deserve to be waiting for @entity14 or @entity15 in next month ’s showpiece at the national stadium after bossing the match @entity19 finally breaks the deadlock for @entity2 with a stooping header that left @entity3 hearts broken @entity19 rises above his marker to direct his header towards goal in the heat of @entity6 @entity19 salutes the travelling @entity2 supporters after scoring the decisive goal in the 74th minute the @entity2 players celebrate taking the lead against @entity3 in the @entity5 semi-final at @entity6 @entity3 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 80 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ; @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 87 ) subs not used : @entity19 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 booked : @entity33 , @entity37 @entity2 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ; @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity19 , @entity57 ; ( @entity58 45 ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 77 ) , @entity61 subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 scorer : @entity19 74 booked : @entity55 referee : @entity70 however , the @entity72 side failed to convert dominance into a goal and @entity19 ’s 75th - minute header settled the tie			1
@entity7 pinpointed that all six of his team ’s goals against @entity3 this season — in three wins and a draw — had come from crosses			1
he said : ‘ after every game we ’ve played against @entity3 this season , they have deserved to win according to @entity1			1
‘ what he should maybe think about is where we are getting our goals from — crosses into their box			2
‘ as a coach , i ’d be concerning myself with losing goals the way @entity3 lose them to us			1
‘ look at the videos			2
they ca n’t deal with crosses into the box , so that ’s his problem , not mine			0
‘ of course , @entity3 were unfortunate not to win			1
i ’m straight up on that			0
they hit the crossbar and the post			1
‘ but rather than say only one team deserved to win , he should think about how the team beat you			0
then look back at the other times			0
@entity3 manager @entity1 ( left ) and @entity2 manager @entity0 shake hands before the match the @entity3 supporters ca n't quite believe their luck as @entity40 and @entity37 both hit the woodwork @entity41 misses from close range for @entity3 on one of those afternoon 's for @entity1 ' side there was n't much too cheer about for @entity3 fans in a sparse @entity6 crowd on saturday ‘ they were the better football side today but do n’t disrespect us by saying we did n’t deserve to win — we put a lot into the match defensively			1
‘ the most important thing is that we scored the goal to win the match			0
’ @entity7 ’ s blast will add extra spice to the fifth meeting of the season — on may 2 when the race for the @entity138 play - off places goes down to the wire			1
and @entity1 has implored his players to overcome the agony of yesterday ’s smash - and - grab defeat by winning a spot in the top flight			2
‘ this will make us stronger , it has to			0
we have to get over it			0
it ’s my job to pick the players up and they need to pick themselves up because there is still plenty to play for			2
‘ my reaction is one of disbelief that we have n’t come through that game			0
we can ’ t create the amount of chances we created and not score			2
‘ we controlled the entire game and that makes it worse			0
but that ’s semi-finals and that can happen			0
i just wish we had some of the luck the opposition had			0

@entity19 's 74th - minute header is enough to send @entity2 through
@entity40 and @entity37 both hit the post for @entity3 with the score at 0 - 0
@entity2 will play either @entity14 or @entity15 on may *30*
