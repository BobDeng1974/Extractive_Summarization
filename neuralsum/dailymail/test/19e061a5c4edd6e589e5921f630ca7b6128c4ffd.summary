a leading hospital has slashed cases of a deadly infection that can kill newborn babies – by defying national guidelines to offer all pregnant women a simple screening test			1
government officials have repeatedly insisted there is no evidence to support universal screening for @entity11 , known as @entity11			1
this is despite the fact it is carried by one in four women and infects as many as 400 newborns in the @entity16 every year			1
one in ten will die			2
current guidelines only recommend testing women deemed to be ' at risk '			1
she was just three days old but a programme which offered screening to all expectant women at @entity31 hospital in @entity32 resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested and subsequently treated with antibiotics			1
the only recorded cases during the 12 - month programme affected babies of women who had not agreed to be tested			1
crucially , clinicians noted that half of the women who tested positive for @entity11 would not have been classified as ' at risk ' under the current guidelines – so their babies would not have been protected			1
the @entity46 carried out a review in 2012 in collaboration with the @entity49 , the @entity50 and @entity51			2
it concluded that not all women who test positive for @entity11 will go on to develop the infection or pass it on to their babies , so blanket screening would mean pregnant women would be unnecessarily given antibiotics , which carry their own risks to the foetus			1
some studies link antibiotics used in pregnancy and labour to obesity and asthma			2
in premature babies an increased risk of cerebral palsy has been associated with use of some antibiotics in labour			1
yet these results confound the decision , prompting calls for the government to introduce universal testing for pregnant women during standard ante - natal appointments , as is the case in @entity80 , @entity81 and the @entity82			1
a programme which offered screening to all expectant women at @entity31 hospital in @entity32 resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested @entity89 , chief executive of the charity @entity90 , said : ' the risk - based strategy has failed to reduce the rate of @entity11 infection , and these findings contradict the party line that the risks of screening every woman would outweigh the benefits			1
' the consultant microbiologist who introduced the screening programme at @entity31 , dr @entity102 , said : ' there was a substantial burden of infection in our local community which was not being prevented by the national guidelines			2
' our work shows that @entity11 screening of all expectant mothers can work and is likely to be more effective than the current risk based approach			1
' dr @entity114 , consultant neonatal paediatrician at @entity115 , said he had seen more than 100 babies with @entity11 in 20 years			1
he said : ' it can lead to serious illness and high mortality rates so it is much better to prevent the infection , rather than attempt to treat it			2
' since we began our comprehensive screening programme , i have not seen a new case in the babies of the mothers we have screened			1
' the makers of a new style of leggings claim they will reduce the appearance of cellulite in just 30 days , thanks to the garment 's ' dimple - destroying ' crystal technology			0
the @entity137 leggings are made from a fibre woven with bio-active crystals , which absorb body heat to stimulate blood flow and lymphatic drainage			0
@entity11 is the most common cause of infection in newborn babies in the @entity16			1
harmless when carried by women , it can prove fatal to babies who contract it when passing through the birth canal			2
many develop meningitis and septicaemia and , if they survive , can be left with life - altering disabilities			0
known as the enhanced culture method , the test simply involves taking a swab from the woman			0
it would cost the @entity160 approximately £ 11 per patient			0
@entity22 , 37 , lost her daughter @entity23 after she contracted @entity11 during labour and developed meningitis and septicaemia			2
she was just three days old			0
@entity22 , who has three older children , had asked a midwife for a @entity11 test when she went to be induced at @entity167 , @entity168 , in may 2013 after noticing some unusual discharge			2
but she was told it was ' not standard practice ' and there was ' no reason ' to give her test			0
mrs @entity22 said : ' what hurts most is that @entity23 's death was entirely preventable			0
' mrs @entity22 is now involved in a legal battle with the hospital over claims that staff repeatedly failed to spot how seriously ill @entity23 was after her birth			0
she is being represented by law firm @entity182			0
bond girl @entity184 's on a fitness mission she 's the @entity16 @entity184 girl with a body to die for			0
now the secret of miss @entity189 's killer figure is out , after the actress was spotted at a fitness class at @entity193 health spa near @entity194 , @entity195			0
the star , 38 , pictured with 007 @entity197 at the @entity199 premiere in @entity200 , tried out the @entity202 class at @entity193 health spa near @entity194 , in @entity195 the star , 38 , tried out the spa 's @entity202 class during a break to recharge her batteries after filming the upcoming @entity184 blockbuster , @entity208			0
the @entity202 method promises to sculpt and strengthen the waist , legs and bottom			0
a source said : ' @entity184 checked in for a weekend and was keen to try out @entity202			0
it really works those muscles .			0

officials have said no evidence to support screening for @entity11
current guidelines only recommend testing women deemed to be ' at risk '
but screening at @entity225 , @entity32 , resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants
only recorded cases during the year affected babies of women who had not agreed to be tested
