@entity0 will consider a january move for @entity3 striker @entity2			1
the @entity5 under 21 international starlet has been targeted by @entity6 and there has been a £ 15million offer mooted by the north @entity10 club			1
that falls ways short of the price which would persuade @entity3 to sell			2
@entity3 and @entity5 under 21 striker @entity2 has 11 goals for club and country this season berahino slots home @entity3 's equaliser in the last minute in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity21 @entity22 ' @entity0 are after @entity2 but @entity3 will want at least £ 25million for him the @entity3 believe @entity2 is worth in excess of £ 25m , and @entity0 ’s potential interest could see a bidding battle with @entity6			1
it is already recognised in @entity0 circles that the signing of @entity29 is a gamble which has not worked			1
but the @entity31 will find it hard to ' move on ' @entity29 in the january transfer window			1
even if they ca n’t , the club are set to move for a new striker , with @entity36 now high on the list			1
@entity40 ’s @entity38 - a @entity6 target last summer - is another option for the @entity31			1
@entity29 ( left ) tussles with @entity43 ( right ) during @entity0 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity45 at @entity46 @entity2 celebrates another goal with the @entity48 and a senior call up could be just around the corner @entity51 is being lined up as @entity53 's successor at @entity54 as pressure grows on the boss mon : @entity57 makes @entity53 ’s accusation that he ’s not playing for @entity54 because he is three stone overweight look rather foolish by getting his shirt off for the lads and revealing a washboard - looking stomach			1
if only we could all be that overweight , eh ? tue : while @entity66 had a point complaining about the ' behind closed doors ' farce in @entity70 , he was really deflecting from another poor display by @entity72 in the @entity73			2
they surrendered a two - goal lead which leaves their hopes of progressing hanging by a thread			0
wed : @entity82 display great spirit by winning their @entity73 game against @entity84 that had seemed lost until the last few minutes			2
it could be a sign that the @entity86 have that bit extra to go along in @entity88 this season given the @entity91 title already seems beyond them			0
thurs : @entity6 ’s @entity93 comes good at last with a wonder goal in the @entity95			1
but it still remains to be seen whether he produces such magic in the @entity91 ( see @entity98 ) fri : ahead of ' @entity100 ' , @entity99 snaps after being asked about the incident which caused his ban then storms out of a press conference			0
why is @entity99 so , er , bitter ? @entity51 is being lined up as @entity53 ’s successor at @entity54			1
the word on the grapevine is that @entity53 may only have two games to save his job			2
that process starts on monday night at @entity111 when @entity54 take on @entity112			2
they face @entity114 next weekend , too			0
it has been perceived that if @entity53 is ousted then @entity116 , whom he brought in as coach , would take over			2
indeed that was one plan			0
@entity116 could well be asked to hold the fort in the short term should @entity53 go and the emergency engagement could evolve			2
@entity123 would also come in to the equation as a successor given his close relationship with @entity127 , who is now @entity128 at the club			0
but @entity131 sources say club owner @entity132 may well see @entity51 as the best man to lead @entity54 to safety just as he did at @entity21 last season			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity136 wants £ 60,000 - a - week to sign a new contract at @entity138			1
the club are reluctant to raise their most recent offer of about £ 45,000 - a - week			1
but given @entity136 ’s contribution to the club ’s excellent start to the season , @entity138 may cede to his demands - especially with his contract expiring at the end of the season			1
defender @entity136 wants a £ 60,000 - a - week deal to sign a new contract at @entity138 @entity151 is considering giving @entity6 ’s @entity152 21 striker @entity153 a call up for the @entity156 qualifier against @entity157 and the friendly versus @entity159 next month			1
@entity138 boss @entity160 has let it be known to @entity151 that he feels @entity162 is worthy of a recall to the @entity5 set up			1
@entity153 wheels away en route to scoring a hat - trick in @entity6 's 5 - 1 demolition of @entity168 @entity72 are considering challenging neighbours @entity169 and @entity82 for @entity172 ’s @entity171 in january			1
@entity173 had previously reported that @entity174 will attempt to block any move to buy @entity171 this january , but @entity172 will overrule their coach if the offer comes close to their £ 10million valuation of the player whose contract runs out at the end of the season			1
@entity171 celebrates winning the @entity183 with @entity184 in @entity185 in the summer @entity171 could leave @entity172 in january if an offer of around £ 10million comes in i am hearing the company @entity188 , whose goal - line technology was again vindicated on saturday , immediately ruling what proved to be @entity193 ’s winner for @entity138 versus @entity72 good , are now working on a system which will offer instant offside decisions			1
@entity196 fails to stop the header from @entity193 as @entity138 take a 2 - 0 lead on saturday i am also hearing although @entity199 has turned the team and his fortunes around at @entity138 thus far - not least in the eyes of co-owner @entity204 - the club will not be rushing into talks over a new contract			1
@entity199 ’s current reputed £ 2.7million - a - year deal expires next summer			1
@entity208 ( right ) kisses @entity138 boss @entity199 after their victory over @entity72 by the way ... opinion seems divided as to whether @entity29 was wrong to swap shirts at half - time when @entity0 were getting their shirts stuffed by @entity172 last week			1
for what it is worth i think he was wrong , showing no respect for his team mates , the fans , the badge and indeed the idea of competitive sport where the shirt is a symbol of the team ethic			0
it seems to me the time has come for the football authorities to act on this issue so there is no debate			0
if a player can be shown a yellow card for ripping off his shirt as part of a goal celebration , then swapping shirts at any point during a match should be a red card offence			0
@entity29 swapped shirts with @entity172 centre - back @entity245 at half - time on wednesday @entity248 following @entity72 ’s defeat at @entity138 , @entity114 can forge ahead in the title race at @entity251 on sunday			1
that is why @entity253 may now instruct his team to go for the kill and win , rather than seek a draw			0
a @entity114 win is 6/4			0
i fancy @entity260 's offer of 12/1 for a 2 - 0 @entity261 win			2
following @entity72 ’s defeat at @entity138 , @entity114 can forge ahead in the title race at @entity251 on sunday			1

a @entity114 win is 6/4			0
i fancy @entity260 's offer of 12/1 for a 2 - 0 @entity261 win			2
@entity98 @entity6 ’s @entity93 caused a bit of a stir last week with a bit of maverick magic in scoring a ' wonder goal ' for @entity6 in their @entity271 win over @entity272			1
it ’s easy to see why many fans got so excited but it did seem some top professionals went over the top in their praise			0
indeed one ex-pro striker i know , while admiring the technique , questioned whether @entity93 would have been able to pull off that bit of showboating against anything other than low grade opposition			0
' if it had been 0 - 0 in a cup final and one chance come along would he do it then ? can you imagine if you got it wrong , fell over and the chance went and the game was lost ? , ' my pal asked			0
@entity293 ? a bit of jealousy even ? maybe			0
@entity93 's astonishing rabona strike put @entity6 in control against @entity168 @entity6 boss @entity298 gives @entity93 a pat on the back after his goalscoring exploits anyway , as we all know now the technical term for a reverse scissor kick is actually a ' rabona '			2
and here is the definition : a method of kicking the football with the kicking leg wrapped around the back of the standing leg , so it appears the player has their legs crossed			0
the first reported rabona happened in a league game in @entity318 in 1948 and was performed by @entity319			0
soon after , a magazine front cover featured @entity319 dressed as a pupil with the caption ' @entity319 played hooky ' ; rabona means to skip school in @entity326			0
@entity327 , @entity328 , @entity329 and @entity330 are among the players who have performed a successful rabona during a game			0
@entity5 legend @entity330 performs the rabona in 1991 as he dons the @entity5 jersey @entity336 there are those who argue that had @entity340 signed for @entity114 in the early @entity341 his career would have been re-booted and the success the @entity261 had winning the @entity344 then @entity345 with swagger would have been sustained			0
as it was @entity114 , like ' @entity348 ' , lost their way			0
that said , @entity340 did appear for @entity114 in @entity352 ’s testimonial in 1975			0
and his two goals in that game prompted then - @entity261 manager @entity355 to try and sign @entity356 , who at the time was playing for @entity359 ' on licence ' from @entity169			1
@entity352 ( centre ) at his testimonial match with @entity340 ( left ) and @entity363 ( right ) in 1975 @entity359 were paying @entity340 , who was just 29 , £ 300 a week , which was more than the weekly wages of most players in the then @entity366			2
when @entity114 approached best he asked for £ 1,000 a week - a staggering sum back in the day			2
a year later @entity340 would sign for @entity369 and for a season or so his career alongside @entity372 enjoyed a revival before he ended up show - boating in the @entity375			2
one can only imagine though what it would have been like on and off the pitch had @entity340 teamed up with @entity352 and @entity363 sooner			0
the picture above conjures up thoughts .			0

@entity0 will consider a january move for @entity3 's @entity2
@entity2 has been targeted by @entity6 , with a £ 15million offer mooted
but @entity3 believe the 21 - year - old is worth in excess of £ 25m
even if @entity0 ca n’t shift @entity29 , an offer could be made
@entity51 is being lined up as @entity53 ’s successor at @entity54
@entity136 wants £ 60,000 - a - week to sign a new deal at @entity138
@entity151 is considering giving @entity6 ’s @entity153 a call up
@entity72 could challenge @entity169 and @entity82 for @entity171
