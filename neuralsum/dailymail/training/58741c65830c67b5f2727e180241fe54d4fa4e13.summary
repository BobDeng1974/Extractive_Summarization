by @entity1 reporter published : 07:30 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 05:42 est , 4 february 2013 a woman spends up to 15 hours a day confined to a den , known as a @entity5 cage , because she claims to have an intolerance to modern technology			1
@entity8 , 51 , says she finds it impossible to use a mobile phone , satnav or @entity12 , because they emit pulsed microwave radiation			1
she has to eat and sleep inside a homemade @entity5 cage as she says this gives her relief from her symptoms			1
@entity8 with her electro sensor : she says the stable electromagnetic field within her @entity5 cage steadies her vibrational system @entity8 sleeping in her homemade @entity5 cage			1
she says the introduction of the @entity25 has worsened her symptoms she suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity intolerance syndrome ( @entity27 ) which means she can not stand to be near pulsed electromagnetic fields			1
@entity8 ’s condition emerged with the arrival of @entity25 mobile phones , although she says a previous electric shock as a teenager may have made her more susceptible			1
@entity8 , who has been unable to work since suffering from @entity35 and a compressed nerve on her spine , suffers agonising head and nerve pain , memory loss , tinnitus , ectopic heart beats , vertigo and aching joints if she goes near mobile phones , @entity12 and satnav			1
she is forced to spend much of each day in a makeshift @entity5 cage in her flat in @entity49			1
however , in the summer she takes the opportunity to escape to a park as she says this helps to earth her system			0
@entity8 made the @entity5 cage herself from off - cut material costing £ 300			1
a ready - made version would have cost her £ 800			1
she claims metal fibres in the netting shield her from the microwave signals and stop her from suffering @entity27 symptoms			2
she said : ' i ca n’t do anything that normal people do , like eating , reading , writing , studying , whilst being exposed to microwave signals without experiencing symptoms			0
it ’s made my life a living hell			2
' @entity8 with a laptop she bought from an @entity73 website that she says has shielding to lower electromagnetic radiation ( left ) and eating in her @entity5 ( right ) @entity8 at home her supplements : she takes them in groups at different times to help with things like detoxing @entity8 worked as a secretary for a number of firms in the 1980s			1
she said : ' even back then i could feel a huge agitation when using the computer , but i thought it was just because i did n’t have the technological skills			0
' now i wonder if i was starting to experience the early symptoms of @entity90			1
' i am studying at home whilst also undertaking training to become a @entity93			0
' i 'm also looking to undertake a doctorate as i need to keep my brain active and i 'm unable to work in a work or college environment			0
' my friends are very supportive but there ’s only so much time you can spend with the woman that ca n’t go anywhere or do anything			0
' i used to love going to festivals and experiencing live music , but because everyone has a mobile i ca n’t even go near a gig now due to mobiles close to my head			1
' the last gig i went to was @entity114			0
i knew i was getting worse and would n’t be able to go to any more so i wanted to make it a good one			0
' it ’s so sad that i can no longer do the things i enjoy			0
' @entity8 out in her garden ( left ) and her @entity5 ( right )			1
she says going outdoors and putting her feet on the earth helps to ' earth ' her @entity27 , also known as @entity122 , is a controversial condition that is recognised in @entity123 and @entity124 but not in the @entity125			1
@entity8 said : ' i ’ve been to my gp countless times begging for tests , but @entity129 wo n't instigate the environmental tests needed			1
one neurological expert said there are people worse off than me and would n't help me			0
it is so frustrating that medicine is n’t keeping up with the technology			0
' we desperately need a white zone - an area where there are low or no emissions - where we can go to relax and recuperate and detox			2
' up to five per cent of the population believe they are affected by electrosensitivity and experience flu - like symptoms , headaches , lethargy and nausea when exposed to various appliances			2
electromagnetic waves are everywhere and we are constantly bombarded by them from space			2
although there is no evidence of any permanent damage to the body from electromagnetic waves , some people have reported that they feel unwell when they are within reach of @entity12 or mobile phone masts			1
@entity12 waves are higher in frequency than mobile phones and are intense due to the amount of info they @entity169 is not recognised as a disability or a medical condition in the @entity125			1
the @entity173 say there is no scientific evidence linking ill health with electrical equipment , although it recognises people do report real and distressing @entity180 medics are sceptical about electromagnetic hypersensitivity syndrome as a result , although some like dr @entity184 think it is a real condition			1
the charity @entity27 @entity125 is a support group for those who believe they suffer from it			0
she added to @entity190 : ' there are hundreds of us in the @entity125 suffering from this condition			2
' it 's not just me - and it could happen to anyone			2
' dr @entity198 , who is a medical adviser for the charity @entity27 @entity125 said : ' the symptoms of @entity27 can cover a broad range of systems , often start subtly and can be mistaken for other medical conditions			0
' adults and children today are exposed to very high levels of electromagnetic fields ( @entity207 ) that no life on the planet has ever witnessed before			0
' it is no surprise that the numbers of those with @entity27 and other conditions linked with @entity207 exposure are rising			0
' dr @entity216 , from @entity217 , added : ' one of the tragedies is that folks use these approaches - cages , shades , necklaces - to try to protect themselves , but those are not long - term solutions			2
' they are simply survival mechanisms			0
the long - term solution is building the internal adaptive capacity that enables those with @entity27 to be like the rest of us - living our lives without the incumbrance of awful @entity27 - triggered symptoms			2
' in 2005 , the @entity173 said there was no scientific evidence to link their ill health with electrical equipment , although it said sufferers could have unpleasant symptoms			1
the review did not look at the impact of waves from phone masts			2
however , in 2007 a double - blind study suggested electrosensitivity could be all in the mind			0
the research , published in the journal @entity251 , found people who thought they were electrosensitive experienced symptoms when they were placed near a mobile phone mast and told it was ' switched on '			0
when the tests were repeated with the volunteers not knowing whether the masts were switched on or off , there was no relationship between their symptoms and the phone signals			0
critics of the study said it only looked at short - term effects and used a fairly small sample size .			0

@entity8 made her own *faraday* cage for £ 300 that she claims *filters* out pulsed electro - magnetic waves
says she suffers agonising head and nerve pain , memory loss , tinnitus , ectopic heart beats , vertigo and aching joints if she goes near mobile phones , @entity12 and satnavs
@entity90 is a controversial condition . @entity173 say there is no scientific evidence linking ill health with electrical equipment
