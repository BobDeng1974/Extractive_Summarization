by @entity0 published : 22:15 est , 19 january 2014 updated : 14:31 est , 20 january 2014 as the nation reflects on the legacy of @entity4 , an audiotape of an interview with the civil rights leader discovered in a @entity9 attic sheds new light on a famous phone call @entity12 made to @entity4 's wife more than 50 years ago			1
historians generally agree that @entity12 's phone call to @entity16 expressing concern over her husband 's arrest in october 1960 - and @entity22 's work behind the scenes to get @entity4 released - helped @entity12 win the @entity24 that fall			1
@entity4 himself , while appreciative , was n't as quick to credit the @entity26 alone with getting him out of jail , according to a previously unreleased portion of the interview with the civil rights leader days after @entity12 's election			1
' but i must make it clear that many other forces worked to bring it about also			1
' a copy of the original recording will be played for visitors at the @entity52 in @entity53 for a ' @entity55 ' event on jan. 20			0
@entity4 was arrested a few weeks before the presidential election at an @entity58 sit - in			2
charges were dropped , but @entity4 was held for allegedly violating probation for an earlier traffic offense and transferred to the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64			2
the @entity26 intervened , and @entity4 was released			2
their intervention won the support of black voters who helped give @entity12 the winning edge in several key states			2
despite their help , however , @entity4 was careful not to give them too much credit			0
' i think dr. @entity4 was aware in the tape that he probably did more for @entity12 than perhaps @entity12 did for him , ' said @entity76 , a @entity77 - based collector and expert on historical artifacts			1
@entity76 acquired the reel - to - reel audiotape from @entity81 , @entity9 , resident @entity82 , who discovered it while cleaning out his father 's attic			1
@entity12 did some behind the scenes work to help release @entity4 from prison @entity91 , director of the @entity92 at @entity94 's @entity93 , said @entity12 's call to @entity4 's wife was political in nature because the @entity26 had been slow to get involved in the civil rights movement			1
he said @entity12 did n't actually commit to the movement until a few months before his assassination when civil rights leader @entity101 was gunned down by a @entity102 outside his @entity105 , @entity104 , home just after midnight on june 12 , 1963			1
the slaying came hours after @entity12 's television speech in support of civil rights and helped propel the struggle for equality to national attention			1
' there were a lot of black folks who ... were n't fully committed to his campaign , ' said @entity91 , who is also a historian and psychologist			0
' that call he made to @entity16 moved black folks			1
' he said @entity4 's comments on the tape were measured because he probably did n't want to offend black supporters , like the @entity124 , that had also aided him			2
' he kind of went in the middle , ' @entity91 said			0
some believe that @entity12 's call to @entity129 was only a ploy to get black voters because the @entity12 ; s were slow to join in on the civil rights movement @entity82 , the @entity81 man who discovered the tape , said his father had planned to write a book about the racism he encountered growing up in @entity81 and later as an adult			1
@entity82 said his dad , an insurance salesman , interviewed @entity4 when he visited the city , but never completed the book and just stored the recording with some other interviews he had done			0
@entity82 's father is now in his late 80s and under hospice care			0
@entity82 has asked that his father not be identified			0
in the recording , @entity4 also discusses his definition of nonviolence , his visit to @entity149 and the impact of the civil rights movement			1
' i am convinced that when the history books are written in future years , historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epochs of our heritage , ' he said			0
' i am convinced that when the history books are written in future years , historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epochs of our heritage , ' said @entity4 in the rediscovered recording after @entity76 acquired the tape , he sold it to magician @entity167 , who then donated it to the @entity52 to promote @entity4 's message of nonviolence			2
@entity167 said @entity4 inspired people to dream			0
' that 's too important for one person to possess , ' @entity167 said of the recording			0
' you have to share that with people to remind as many people as possible of the message			0
' @entity180 , the museum 's director of education , said she 's pleased the museum 's visitors will get a chance to hear the recording , which will be among the exhibits at the newly - renovated facility scheduled to fully open in april			0
' it 's so powerful for us to be able to hear dr. @entity4 in his own words again so many years after his death , ' @entity180 said			2
' and i think for our visitors to be able to hear him say these words again will resonate in ... a way that we could not convey third person			0
