@entity0 , whose heat map is shown below , was largely kept quiet by @entity2 final match zone in the end it was the young man from @entity7 , the most expensive footballer the world has known , who settled an epic tussle between @entity12 ’s two sides in @entity14 ’s @entity13			1
@entity16 it was at the far post who was on hand to head home when @entity22 ’s shot had rebounded off the leg of @entity24 and fell invitingly for him 20 minutes into extra time in doing so , as he wheeled away to be engulfed by a mass of celebrating bodies and greeted by a roar of utter relief , redemption was found			1
this might have been the final defined by his miss on 32 minutes			0
instead @entity12 have their illusive tenth @entity36 , @entity16 joins an illustrious group of @entity38 who have won the famous old trophy with foreign clubs and @entity42 has equalled @entity44 ’s record of winning the @entity36 three times : all thanks to @entity16			1

referee : @entity129 ( @entity130 ) there would be a third goal from full back @entity98 , shooting from just inside the box , three minutes from the end			1
and @entity0 would add a penalty in the last minute after he had been tripped in the box to give the score - line an entirely unmerited gloss			2
yet it was @entity16 ’s goal which finally broke @entity88			1
how @entity12 were made to work for those milestones ; how close they came to failure			2
@entity144 had led 1 - 0 with three minutes of added time played when @entity72 ’ header cruelly denied them a triumph , an almost exact re-run of how they lost this trophy against @entity152 in 1974			1
in the end it was all too much			0
their extraordinary coach , @entity47 invaded the pitch before the end to protest , bringing a red card for the @entity160			0
it was a seemly end to a brave fight for this team constructed at half the cost of @entity16 ’s price tag			2
for while recognising the achievement of @entity12 – and in the end their sheer willpower and determination not to lose prevailed – it was impossible not to recognise the enormity of @entity88 ’s achievement			1
breakthrough : @entity112 headed @entity88 into the lead with 10 minutes until half - time glance : the @entity178 defender beat @entity100 to the ball to flick his header past @entity63 error : @entity63 ' misjudgement left him in stranded and he could n't prevent @entity112 's header from finding the net stretch : the @entity187 goalkeeper could n't prevent @entity112 's header from crossing the goal line bundle : @entity2 players maul @entity112 to celebrate the opening goal at the @entity13 historic : @entity112 became the first @entity178 to score in the @entity36 final cheerleader : @entity88 manager @entity47 whips up the crowd in @entity14 having won the @entity187 league , they were but seconds away from a @entity36 victory that would have upended the establishment of @entity200 football			1
they had done so despite losing their totemic striker @entity121 after just nine minutes , his unlikely recovery from a hamstring injury proving illusory			2
not since @entity206 won this trophy with @entity208 in 2004 have a team of similar resources done so well			0
indeed , @entity47 puts you in mind of @entity214 @entity213 , pitch invasions and all			0
it ’s not just that they live in the shadow of the richer , more illustrious neighbours ; until this time last year and the @entity224 final they had n’t even beaten @entity12 for 14 years			2
u turn : @entity121 was withdrawn in the ninth minute having unexpectedly started the match trickery : @entity228 striker @entity102 started for @entity12 alongside @entity0 and @entity16 chance : @entity16 reacts after missing the target with a glorious opportunity in the first half hero : @entity72 headed home in injury time to rescue @entity12 and send the tie to extra-time saviour : the @entity187 centre - back found the far corner with his header deep into injury time delight : @entity72 celebrates his dramatic equaliser in front of the ecstatic @entity12 supporters relief : @entity63 , who made the mistake in the first half , celebrates with @entity98 despair : @entity2 's @entity122 reacts after seeing @entity72 ' equaliser fly into the back of the net and on saturday night they were on the verge of something spectacular			1
they have already disposed of @entity93 and @entity259 and now they led @entity12 with 90 minutes on the clock			2
@entity261 was running out ; hope was slipping away			0
@entity12 ’s worst nightmare was unfolding before them , their upstart neighbours about to claim the victory to end all arguments			2
five minutes of injury time were indicated and @entity47 was already furious , the first sign of the imminent breakdown			0
three minutes into that added time came a corner from @entity99			0
it was well delivered but the leap of @entity72 and the ferocity of his header was something to behold			2
it fairly flew into the bottom corner and a good two thirds of the stadium erupted as the @entity12 bench sprinted to join in the celebrations			0
at the last , @entity12 had rescued it and pushed the game into extra time			1
historic : @entity16 heads home in injury time to give @entity12 a vital lead in @entity14 big moment : the £ 86m @entity291 delivered when @entity12 needed it most in @entity14 roar : @entity16 celebrates his goal in extra time at the @entity13 in @entity14 delight : @entity12 celebrate @entity16 's breakthrough goal in extra-time from thereon in , it was all about holding on for penalties for @entity144			1
they had given their all ; there simply was no more			0
they had started the game with customary gusto , despite missing @entity305 and losing @entity121			2
with @entity47 cajoling , encouraging them every step of the way from the touchline , they proved thoroughly disruptive with @entity117 , @entity119 and @entity115 terrier - like in midfield			0
real were slowly constructing some coherent football , there best chance coming on 32 minutes from a characteristic burst from @entity16 after a mis - placed @entity118 pass			0
@entity316 opened up and the @entity291 sprinted goal - wards from 30 yards out			2
no 3 : @entity318 defender @entity98 added his name to the score sheet with @entity12 's third goal start the car : @entity0 slots home a penalty to seal @entity12 's 10th @entity200 triumph ripped : @entity0 had the final say on his return to @entity14 , where he once played for @entity327 mobbed : @entity0 celebrates his penalty right at the end of extra time at the @entity13 stand off : @entity12 defender @entity97 and @entity2 's @entity117 exchange their views booked : @entity12 defender @entity72 is shown a yellow card by referee @entity129 a glorious opportunity beckoned but with @entity111 sliding in , @entity16 was somehow distracted enough and ended up shooting wide , throwing his hands to his face as he recognised the importance of the moment that had just passed			1
@entity144 ’s retort came four minutes later			0
a @entity117 corner was headed away on 36 minutes and then returned by the head of @entity110 , looping into the penalty area			0
there was little danger until @entity63 , the 33 - year - old came sprinting off his line in a panic			0
to the heavens : @entity72 shows his delight as the referee blows the final whistle in the 2014 final contract : @entity2 's @entity112 is left gutted as @entity12 celebrate their victory gutted : @entity2 's @entity354 midfielder @entity118 is left devastated by the result job done : @entity42 celebrates after his @entity12 team won their 10th @entity200 crown as he did , @entity178 @entity112 , who will soon take on @entity359 , rose above the @entity12 defence to divert the ball over the unfortunate goalkeeper			1
despairing @entity63 was already retreating , realising his error ; he even got a hand to the ball , but to no avail			0
it was over the line and a manic @entity112 was off on a celebratory run that would end under a mass of @entity2 players			1
@entity12 would strive for an equaliser			0
a @entity0 free kick was deflected onto the bar on 54 minutes ; his header glanced wide on 62 minutes ; @entity16 simply sprinted past @entity112 on 78 minutes but shot tamely into the side netting			1
@entity12 ’s conviction was waning ; it seemed that the mighty were about to be unseated by the common rabble			0
it was n’t to be ; @entity382 ’s header and @entity16 ’s goal saw to that			1
but it was a might close run thing			0
stage : the opening ceremony takes place in front of a packed @entity13 in @entity14 prize : @entity354 legend @entity390 parades the @entity36 trophy before kick - off travels : @entity14 's @entity394 is flooded with football fans in the build - up to the game @entity398 : @entity12 supporters pack into the @entity13 ready for kick - off in the final passionate : @entity88 's supporters in fine voice before the showpiece final back home : @entity12 supporters sold out the @entity406 to watch the game on big screens			1
