by @entity1 reporter @entity2 is the only country in the @entity4 that still ' taxes ' for medication the ‘ outdated and iniquitous ’ @entity8 prescription charge should be scrapped , a gp has said			1
@entity2 remains the only country in the @entity4 still stumping up for the ‘ tax ’ on medicines			1
the latest figures for 2012 show that 80 per cent of those aged 18 to 59 had to pay for their drugs			1
the £ 8.05 charge compares starkly with the cost of many commonly prescribed drugs that are now off patent , according to dr @entity20 , editor of the journal @entity22			1
there are a host of exemptions to the charge – including age and pregnancy – but these extend to unrelated conditions			2
in an editorial , dr @entity20 said many exemptions appear ‘ illogical ’			0
he added : ‘ it is time that politicians showed their commitment to a patient - centred @entity8 and abolished prescription charges in @entity2			2
’ the prescription charge has long been a contentious issue , says @entity22 , and even contributed to the resignation of @entity40 , the architect of the @entity8 , in 1951			2
since then , various calls have been made for a fundamental review of the charge , including from patient organisations , the @entity45 , and the @entity46			0
several alternative arrangements have been suggested , including getting the patient to pay for drugs at cost plus a reasonable dispensing fee to the pharmacist , which , incidentally is how private prescriptions can be dispensed , says @entity22			0
although fees for private prescriptions vary widely , they can actually end up being cheaper than an @entity8 prescription			0
another anomaly is that while @entity59 is not paid on prescriptions dispensed in the community , @entity8 trusts have to pay the full 20 per cent levy on medicines dispensed from a hospital pharmacy			2
dr @entity20 said this may contribute to ' perverse prescribing decisions ' which do n't serve the patient well			0
' @entity68 ' : figures reveal 80 per cent of patients aged 18 - 59 paid £ 8.05 for medication in 2012 he added : ' as a cost saving measure , many hospitals discourage doctors in outpatient departments from prescribing medicines to patients sitting in front of them in their clinic			1
' instead they are asked to write to the patient 's gp recommending the prescription			0
' he said this means the patient has to contact their gp to get the drugs they need before taking the prescription to a local pharmacy , which the @entity22 describes as ' clearly very inefficient and hardly patient - centred			0
' dr @entity20 added : ' charges are clearly outdated and iniquitous , and we believe it is time that politicians showed their commitment to a patient - centred @entity8 and abolish prescription charges in @entity2			1

@entity2 is the only country in the @entity4 still taxing for medicines
figures show 80 *%* of patients aged 18 to 59 paid for drugs in 2012
£ 8.05 charge is ' iniquitous ' compared to prices elsewhere , doctors say
