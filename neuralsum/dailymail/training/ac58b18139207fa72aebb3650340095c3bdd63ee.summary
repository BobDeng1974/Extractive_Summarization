all action : met police commissioner sir @entity1 broke off an interview when he saw a taxi driver allegedly being robbed , jumped into the cab and soon afterwards arrested a suspect it is never a bright idea to commit a crime in front of a policeman , let alone @entity13 ’s most senior officer			1
perhaps the brazen yobs who robbed a taxi driver in broad daylight on a busy @entity18 street presumed that @entity19 boss sir @entity1 was too busy giving a radio interview to do anything about it			1
but they had n’t reckoned on the steely determination of the commissioner who broke off mid-sentence to give chase to the gang , leaping in the victim ’s minicab to pursue them yesterday			0
in a scene described by stunned locals as like something out of a film , the 56 - year - old commissioner once dubbed a ‘ crime - busting machine ’ , sprang into action arresting a 19 - year - old suspect within minutes , while his bodyguard collared a 17 - year - old accomplice			1
the incident in @entity43 , @entity18 was captured on tape at 11.20am yesterday as the @entity46 boss was taking part in a pre-recorded interview with @entity51 @entity50 presenter @entity49			1
as sir @entity1 was talking about police cuts , a taxi slowed to a halt beside him and four thugs leapt out and ran off to the fury of the driver who called out for help , saying in broken @entity60 : ‘ i ’m a cab driver			1
‘ i put £ 20 here ( gesturing to the dashboard )			0
is no pay me and the money is gone			0
’ sir @entity1 responded : ‘ do you know where they ’ve gone ? ’ adding : ‘ i ’m going to go with you			2
’ the commissioner then leapt into the victim ’s minicab to look for the suspects before continuing the pursuit in a squad car , arresting a 19 - year - old suspect on suspicion of theft minutes later			1
a 17 - year - old man was also apprehended at nearby @entity76 train station on suspicion of theft , handling stolen goods and making off without payment by an accompanying officer who followed him on foot			1
afterwards the driver , who gave his name as @entity85 , told the @entity51 he did n’t know who the commissioner was , but described him as a ‘ very good , very kind ’ man who came to his aid after passengers stole £ 20 from his dashboard before running away without paying the fare			2
he said : ‘ when i see the police , i ask the police ‘ please can you stop the guys ? ’ one local shop worker who witnessed the chase said : ‘ i thought they were filming for some sort of tv programme - it looked like it could ’ve been staged			0
‘ there was a cab that had pulled up across the road and i could also see the guys who were filming			2
‘ i went outside and saw two police men			0
another policeman , who was in plain clothes , had grabbed a young guy outside the station and had him pinned up against the wall			0
’ another witness , who asked not to be named , recalled : ‘ we saw people running and guys with camera - i thought they were making a movie			0
’ @entity119 decision : sir @entity1 leaps into the taxi in @entity43 , north @entity18 , to help look for the suspects yesterday the top policeman whose motto is ‘ total policing ’ told of his pride at making an arrest in every rank he has held since becoming an officer in 1979 , joking that it was a ‘ disgrace ’ he had n’t felt a collar in almost three years as the @entity46 boss			1
he told the @entity51 : ‘ the important thing for today , at least for me , is that i have made an arrest at every rank as a police officer , so as chief constable at @entity139 , but never as commissioner , and i have been here three years - that ’s very slack , it ’s a disgrace , but today we have put it right			0
’ sir @entity1 , who has been nicknamed @entity144 - the legendary lawman in prohibition @entity145 whose team of @entity148 brought down @entity149 - is known as an all action commissioner who is equally at home patrolling on horseback as behind a desk			2
in 2006 when he was chief constable of @entity154 , he sprinted after a suspected drink - driver in @entity156 after spotting him from his chauffeur - driven car			2
a @entity46 spokesman said : ‘ sir @entity1 was in @entity160 at the junction of @entity76 recording an interview with @entity163 , when a mini cab stopped and the driver called for police help			1
‘ four males were seen to jump out of the vehicle and run off , closely followed by an officer who was with the commissioner			0
‘ a 17 - year old youth was arrested inside @entity172 on suspicion of theft , handling and making off without payment			2
‘ descriptions were circulated and the commissioner got into a police car which arrived at the scene and went to look for the outstanding suspects			0
‘ in nearby @entity182 , one of the suspects , a 19 - year old man , was seen and arrested on suspicion of theft and making off without payment			1
’ last night the two suspects were currently being held in police stations in north @entity18 .			0
