the @entity0 has warned fuel prices could increase by 5p per litre before the end of september petrol prices are set to rise 5p per litre as global factors including the civil unrest in @entity6 and @entity7 push up crude oil prices , retailers have warned			1
the fall in @entity12 's oil exports and the rise in demand from @entity15 have also forced the price of crude oil up , the @entity0 has said			1
the association made the prediction as the @entity20 suggested @entity22 crude prices could rise to $ 115 a barrel in the ' very near term '			0
the association 's chairman @entity25 said : ' @entity28 petrol prices have not yet seen the full impact of this crude oil increase due to the rapid and slightly unexpected revaluation of pound sterling from $ 1.48 to $ 1.56			1
' therefore it was concerning to read recent comments from the @entity35 that the " pound is overblown " and will soon come hurtling down towards the $ 1.45 level			0
' we calculate at current wholesale prices that this will add a further 5p per litre at the pump before the end of september and hit businesses and households in the pocket at a time when pundits are forecasting a continued increase in retail sales to drive growth in the economy			1
' should the @entity55 tensions escalate further and crude oil prices react accordingly , the @entity53 ’s new inflation targets could be significantly challenged			1
' last week it was revealed motorists are having to deal with a ‘ @entity60 ’ attitude to petrol pricing as some towns charge far more for unleaded and diesel than others , according to the @entity66			0
the motoring organisation said that in some areas there are ' pump price dogfights ' , as supermarkets and other forecourts battle to be the cheapest			0
but in areas that lack this competition , prices remain higher			0
unrest in @entity7 and @entity6 are among the factors for the rise in crude oil prices , according to the @entity0			1
much of @entity80 has been flooded with armoured vehicles and soldiers in a crackdown on protests it came as the @entity66 's monthly fuel price report revealed petrol pump prices had gone up by an average of 3p a litre since june and were showing no signs of falling away			2
at 137.52p a litre , petrol last week averaged 1.74p a litre more than a month earlier , at 135.78p , and was almost 3p dearer than june ’s 134.6p price plateau – although prices dropped slightly last weekend			2
according to @entity98 , @entity97 brokers have said global oil demand has gone up by 1.1million barrels a day this year compared to the beginning of last year			0
the @entity0 made the prediction as the @entity20 suggested @entity22 crude prices could rise to $ 115 a barrel in the ' very near term '			2

fall in @entity12 's oil exports also forced the price of crude oil up , retailers say
@entity0 predict increase of 5p per litre before *october*
