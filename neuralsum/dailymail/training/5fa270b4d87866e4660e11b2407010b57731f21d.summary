@entity1 's interview with the man leading the charge to have him deported turned explosive as the @entity5 anchor tried to discuss gun control in @entity7			1
@entity1 brought radio talk show host @entity8 onto his prime time show on monday to explain why he thinks the @entity13 journalist and broadcaster should be banned from the @entity7 for his views on gun control			1
the topic has been the focus of @entity1 's shows since the december 14 massacre at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			2
@entity8 , however , spent nearly all of the time screaming at @entity1 at the top of his lungs , calling him a ' redcoat foreigner ' and threatening revolution if anyone tried to ' take our guns			1
no matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to be taken			0
we will not relinquish them , ' @entity8 said			2
@entity8 , a well - known conspiracy theorist whose radio show and website , @entity55 , reaches millions of @entity7 , at one point challenged @entity1 to a boxing match			1
he also claimed ' mass murder suicide pills ' like the anti-depressant @entity59 were the real cause of massacres like the ones at @entity21 and the late screening of the ' @entity64 ' in @entity65 , @entity66			0
throughout the exchange , @entity1 attempted to foster a debate about gun control , beginning with the fact that the @entity7 counted more than 11,000 gun murders last year while @entity13 had only 35			1
finger pointing : @entity8 said @entity1 is a foreigner who is working to disarm the @entity7 people for dastardly purposes fiery : @entity1 tried several times to calm @entity8 down and had little success angry : @entity8 clearly had a point to make and was intent on shouting to ensure he was heard he tried many times to calm @entity79 down and get him to answer his questions			1
most of the time , it was a failed effort and @entity8 was insistent on getting his own points across			2
@entity1 , a @entity85 columnist and former editor of the @entity87 and @entity88 , began one exchange by saying : ' let 's try again			2
you accuse me of attacking the second amendment ... ' @entity8 responded : ' i wan na get people off pills that the insert says will make you commit suicide and kill people			2
i wan na blame the real culprit - suicide pills			0
' when asked again about the difference in the murder rates between the @entity7 and @entity13 , @entity8 responded : ' you 're a hatchet man of the @entity105 ' - referring to the belief among conspiracy theorists that an international cabal is working to break down national boundaries and control the entire world			1
argument : @entity8 refuses to remove his shoes while going through airport security as a police officer allegedly threatens to arrest him iconic : these image of police officers and teachers leading children to safety immediately after the @entity21 massacre was seen around the world @entity1 was persistent : ' let 's try again			1
how many gun murders were there in @entity13 last year ? ' @entity8 responded : ' i do n't know , how many chimpanzees can dance on the head of a pin ? ' @entity129 , who faces multiple counts of first - degree murder and attempted murder for the @entity66 theater @entity134 rises shooting @entity8 is leading a drive to petition the @entity137 , under its @entity138 , to deport @entity1 back to @entity13 because he ' is engaged in a hostile attack against the @entity140 by targeting the @entity141			1
' the petition has more than 105,000 votes - more than four times the number required to receive an official @entity137 response			1
@entity8 explained the reason for the petition , saying : ' it 's to point out that you 're a foreigner , a redcoat , here telling us what to do			1
' ' @entity152 ' refers to the red uniforms @entity13 soldiers wore as they fought the colonists during the @entity156			2
before he had even managed to arrive for his appearance on @entity1 's show , @entity8 had already been filmed in argumentative scenes			1
a known critic of @entity161 , @entity8 felt he was being singled out when @entity163 airport security made him remove his shoes			2
in the ensuing argument , @entity8 claims , he was threatened with arrest by police until he agreed to their request			1
after @entity1 's interview with @entity8 first aired , the @entity137 press office responded to questions about the petition with a statement saying : ' the @entity137 responds to all petitions that cross the threshold and we will respond to this one			1
' in the meantime , it is worth remembering that the freedom of expression is a bedrock principle in our democracy			0
' @entity8 starts by explaining his reason for supporting the @entity141 @entity8 : we did it as a way to bring attention to the fact that we have all of these foreigners , and the @entity195 government , the official @entity196 government -- @entity197 said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun , he killed about 80 million people because he 's the only guy who had the guns -- so we did it to point out that this is globalism , and the mega banks that control the planet and brag they have taken over -- in @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , you name it -- brag that they 're going to get our guns as well			1
they 've taken everybody 's guns , but the @entity216 and the @entity7 people and when they get our guns , they can have their world tyranny while the government buys 1.6 billion bullets , armored vehicles , tanks , helicopters , predator drones , armed now in @entity7 skies , being used to arrest people in @entity227			0
the @entity141 is n't there for duck hunting			0
it 's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs			0
take the woman in @entity236 , your piece earlier on @entity5 earlier , i was watching during @entity240 's show , did n't tell you the women of @entity236 have signed giant petitions to get firearms because the police ca n't and wo n't protect them			1
the answer is -- wait a minute , i have @entity248 crime statistics that come out of a year late , 2011 , 20 - plus percent crime drop in the last nine years , real violent crime because more guns means less crime			0
@entity13 took the guns 15 , 16 years ago			2
tripling of your overall violent crime			0
true , we have a higher gun violence level , but overall , muggings , stabbing , deaths -- those men [ allegedly ] raped that woman in @entity236 to death with an iron rod 4 feet long			2
you ca n't ban the iron rods			0
the guns , the iron rods , @entity269 , did n't do it , the tyrants did it			0
@entity273 took the guns @entity275 took the guns , @entity197 took the guns , @entity278 took the guns , @entity280 took the guns , and i 'm here to tell you , 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms ! it does n't matter how many lemmings you get out there in the street begging for them to have their guns taken			1
we will not relinquish them			0
do you understand ? he goes on talk about the lower number of gun deaths in the @entity13 @entity8 : i already said earlier that @entity300 had lower gun crime rate because you took all the guns			1
but you have hoards of people burning down cities and beating old women 's brains out out everyday			0
they arrest people in @entity300 if they defend themselves , that 's on record			0
my @entity313 , you have a total police state			0
everybody is fleeing the country because -- you 've had to flee , bud			0
yeah , you fled here			0
why do n't you go back and face the charges for the hacking scandal ? @entity1 : answer this question			2
how many -- @entity321 : why did you get fired from the @entity87 for putting out fake stories ? you 're a hatchet man of the @entity105			0
you 're a hatchet man ! and i 'm going to say this here , you think you 're a tough guy ? have me back with a boxing ring and i 'll wear red , white , and blue , and you 'll wear your @entity328			0
