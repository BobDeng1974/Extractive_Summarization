by @entity0 published : 12:46 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 16:03 est , 5 march 2014 under pressure from gun control advocates , @entity2 agreed wednesday to delete posts from users selling illegal guns or offering weapons for sale without background checks			1
a similar policy will be applied to @entity12 , the company 's photo - sharing network , @entity2 said			2
the measures will be put into effect over the next few weeks and will apply worldwide at @entity2 , which claims 1.3 billion active users			0
' we will remove reported posts that explicitly indicate a specific attempt to evade or help others evade the law , ' the company said in a statement			0
worrisome trend ? in response to outcries from gun control advocates , @entity2 says it will ban all posts and accounts that somehow facilitate or advocate illegal gun sales on the social media site @entity34 attorney general @entity33 has been asking @entity2 to adopt such restrictions , as have @entity36 , the group backed by former @entity34 mayor @entity38 , and @entity39			1
@entity39 collected more than 230,000 signatures on petitions calling on @entity2 to act			0
' responsible social media sites know that it is in no one 's interest for their sites to become the 21st - century black market in dangerous and illegal goods that place our families and communities at risk , ' @entity33 said			1
' i congratulate @entity2 and @entity12 for taking these simple , common - sense steps to protect the safety and security of their users , and encourage other social media sites to follow their lead			1
' @entity62 , president of the @entity34 affiliate of the @entity64 , acknowledged that @entity2 is allowed to set its own rules but said he regards the new restrictions as ' a kind of limit on our first amendment rights			1
' although his group , the @entity71 , does n't sell guns , he wondered whether it could be blocked if somebody reported the organization 's @entity2 page			2
as for legal sales ... : there 's no way to know how many guns are sold via @entity2 , because the transactions are actually completed offline			1
the rules also include new age limits for posts promoting sales of restricted items like firearms ' this is something that could greatly get out of control very quickly , ' @entity62 said			0
@entity34 has some of the nation 's toughest gun laws			0
it requires a background check for private gun sales and prohibits sales of some popular firearms , such as the @entity97			1
under the new policy , @entity2 would allow a user in @entity100 to list an @entity97 for sale , since the gun is legal there , as long as it was n't offered for sale in states where the weapon is illegal			2
but the company would delete a similar post from someone in @entity34			0
outcry : in an online petition , @entity39 warned that @entity2 and @entity12 could also be used to sell guns to convicted felons , domestic abusers or others barred under federal law from obtaining a firearm it would also remove posts from any state in which a gun seller says a background check will be skipped , even if such checks are n't required where the seller lives			1
' this is one of many areas where we face a difficult challenge balancing individuals ' desire to express themselves on our services and recognizing that this speech may have consequences elsewhere , ' @entity2 said			0
the company already has systems in place to remove advertising that is false and deceptive , and it prohibits ads for illegal drugs , tobacco products and prescription drugs			0
there 's no way to know how many guns are sold via @entity2 , because the transactions are actually completed offline , said @entity145 , chairman of @entity36			2
but such sales have occurred			0
in @entity149 , for example , federal authorities in february charged an @entity151 man with illegally selling a 9 mm pistol to a @entity149 teenager in a transaction arranged through @entity2			2
in an online petition , @entity39 warned that @entity2 and @entity12 could also be used to sell guns to convicted felons , domestic abusers or others barred under federal law from obtaining a firearm			1
that list also includes people judged mentally defective			0
@entity145 said @entity164 and @entity165 already prohibit all gun sales , legal or illegal			1
but he said there are ' virtual gun shows ' online			0
his group issued a report in december showing 66,000 active ads on a popular gun sales website called @entity174			1
the report said 16 states and the @entity176 require background checks for private firearm purchases .			0

the social media *giant* made the move in response to pressure from gun control advocates *decrying* illicit gun sales that *originate* on @entity2
supporters of the move say it will stop *children* and criminals from illegally obtaining guns through the site
*opponents* like the @entity64 suggest the laws are eating into @entity198 rights
