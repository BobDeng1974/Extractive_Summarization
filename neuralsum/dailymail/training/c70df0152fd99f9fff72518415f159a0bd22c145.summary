a drone flying near @entity1 almost crashed into a passenger jet – raising fears that this year ’s must - have @entity5 gift could cause a disaster in the skies over @entity8			1
the remote - controlled device , flown by an unidentified amateur , was spotted by the airliner ’s pilot but alarmingly was not detected by air traffic control radars			1
the @entity8 @entity14 , the air safety panel that investigates near misses , gave the incident the highest risk rating of @entity19 , meaning there was a ‘ serious risk of collision ’			1
it comes after warnings over the dangers posed to passenger planes by recreational drones flown by amateurs			1
they are expected to be a best - seller this @entity5 , with models as cheap as £ 35 being snapped up			1
sales have risen rapidly – around 2,000 a month are being bought – and electronics retailer @entity46 said they are currently one of its biggest sellers			0
the most sophisticated designs cost up to £ 3,000			0
a plane had a near miss with drone as it landed at @entity1 ( pictured ) on july 22 in the first recorded incident they can include cameras and are usually used for recreational purposes – although increasingly they are being considered for commercial uses , such as carrying deliveries and monitoring farmers ’ crops			2
the @entity14 will publish a report later this week into the @entity1 incident , which involved an @entity65 that can carry up to 180 passengers			0
the jet was flying at an altitude of 700ft on the afternoon of july 22 this year when the pilot spotted the drone			1
he reported the near miss and an inquiry was launched by the board			0
worryingly , investigators were unable to identify the drone and it disappeared after the sighting			0
it is the latest in a series of incidents involving unmanned planes			0
in may , the pilot of a 74 - seat plane reported that a quadcopter drone flew within 80ft as he was approaching @entity85 airport and in december 2012 , the crew of a @entity87 777 coming in to land at @entity88 said they saw ‘ two white or silver discs ’			1
drones ( file picture ) are priced from just £ 35 and sales have jumped thanks to extra pre-christmas demand in april this year , the owner of a remote - controlled plane was ordered to pay £ 4,340 in fines and costs after his machine crashed in a no - fly zone near a shipyard in @entity102 for defence company @entity103 , where nuclear submarines were being built			1
the @entity105 ( @entity106 ) has demanded better protection for the public against the risk of drones			2
there are currently few rules on operating drones			0
but @entity106 wants them to meet the same safety standards as piloted aircraft , including only being flown by operators with pilot - equivalent training			2
@entity106 general secretary @entity119 said : ‘ the @entity8 should become a “ safe drone zone ” so we can make the most of the major business and leisure opportunities offered by remotely piloted aircraft , while protecting passengers , pilots and residents			0
’ the device was spotted by the pilot but was not detected by air traffic control radars at @entity1 ( pictured ) he added : ‘ the technology is developing quickly and we could see remote aircraft the same size as a @entity136 being operated commercially in our skies within ten years			1
’ in october , intelligence experts warned of the misuse of drones and called for ‘ urgent ’ measures to safeguard @entity8 airspace to cope with commercial use , which is expected to be more widespread by 2035			2
their research for a @entity146 report said that the ‘ hazards presented by inadvertent or accidental misuse of [ drones ] , or the consequences of their malfunctioning , are becoming better understood ’			0
and a conference on unmanned craft in @entity154 last month heard that police were worried about injuries on @entity157 when amateur ‘ pilots ’ try out their new drones .			0

incident was rated as risk rating of @entity19 - the most serious of near - collisions
pilot spotted the drone at 700ft after air traffic control radars had missed it
it comes amid growing concerns about drones being flown by amateurs
drones expected to be @entity5 best - seller with models as cheap as £ 35
