by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:20 am on 17th february 2012 @entity2 took a dramatic gamble with the future of the union yesterday by offering to hand more powers to @entity7 after a referendum on independence – and got nothing in return			1
the prime minister said the @entity7 could have further devolution if they vote no to a breakaway			1
his surprise concession angered @entity17 mps who insisted that @entity19 leader @entity18 should get no further powers without a referendum in @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 too			2
mr @entity2 met mr @entity18 in @entity25 and emerged ‘ frustrated ’ after the first minister refused to budge an inch on his plans for a referendum			1
mr @entity2 met mr @entity18 in @entity25 and emerged ' frustrated ' after the first minister refused to budge an inch on his plans for a referendum the @entity33 leader was last night still insisting that the @entity7 people must be given the chance to vote not just on independence but also for beefed - up powers dubbed ‘ devo max ’			1
the prime minister sought to undercut that position by offering @entity7 sweeping new powers during an impassioned speech in which he said he was ‘ ready to fight for the life of this country ’			1
he said : ‘ when the referendum on independence is over , i am open to looking at how the devolved settlement can be improved further			0
‘ and , yes , that does mean considering what further powers could be devolved			0
but that must be a question for after the referendum , when @entity7 has made its choice about the fundamental question of independence or for the @entity55			2
’ oat so @entity7 : @entity2 sits down to a bowl of porridge and some shortbread on a visit to the @entity61 factory in @entity62 mr @entity2 refused to spell out exactly what he had in mind but @entity66 sources said he is thinking about handing the @entity7 government greater control of tax and spending in areas such as welfare policies , to add to its control of health , personal care and university tuition fees			1
no 10 officials insisted they were not preparing to hand mr @entity18 full ‘ devo max ’ , which would give the first minister control of everything except defence and foreign affairs			2
but if mr @entity2 had hoped the bold gambit would help win concessions from mr @entity18 , he was quickly rebuffed			1
after the talks mr @entity2 said : ‘ i am afraid there was n’t much progress			0
’ one aide said : ‘ he found it frustrating			0
’ @entity7 's first minister @entity18 greets @entity2 as he arrives for talks at @entity92 in @entity25 yesterday last night mr @entity18 accused the prime minister of attempting to ‘ hijack ’ the public consultation on a referendum under way in @entity7 by making vague offers			1
what powers does @entity7 have now ? under devolution , the @entity99 already has wide - ranging powers to set laws on domestic issues from education , to health and prisons			1
for example , the @entity7 people enjoy free tuition fees and free personal care for the elderly			1
the @entity112 , currently going through @entity113 , will give £ 12billion of extra powers allowing @entity7 to control even more of its budget			2
decisions , mainly concerning matters which have an impact on the @entity55 as a whole , or indeed on an international basis , such as taxation , foreign affairs and defence , are reserved and dealt with at @entity124			0
what extra powers could @entity2 give @entity7 ? @entity33 leader @entity18 is pushing for the @entity7 people to be allowed a vote on a so - called ‘ devo max ’ option which would hand greater powers to @entity7			1
@entity132 max has never been fully explained , but is described by the @entity99 as ‘ control of all laws , taxes and duties ’ within the @entity55			0
@entity137 would be able to raise and spend its own cash , while defence , foreign affairs and monetary policy would remain reserved to @entity124			0
what would full independence mean ? @entity7 would become an entirely independent country with control over its own fiscal , defence and foreign policy			2
the first minister said : ‘ give us the detail , where ’s the beef , what is the proposal , what is on the table ? ‘ he ca n’t seriously expect the people of @entity7 to go into this huge debate , the biggest debate for 300 years about the future of our country , and have people say , “ look , we ’re thinking about giving you something else ; we ’re not telling you what it is ”			1
that ’s not a tenable position			0
’ privately some @entity168 warned that mr @entity2 was in danger of ‘ giving away the farm ’ to the @entity33 before the referendum campaign has even begun			0
they believe mr @entity18 does not really want independence but is just keen to secure control of the levers of power – with @entity7 ’s economy propped up by the @entity179 and @entity22 taxpayers			1
mr @entity2 ’s critics will be emboldened by a @entity182 report published today which makes clear that ‘ devo max ’ would have to be subjected to a @entity55 - wide referendum			2
former cabinet minister @entity186 said : ‘ @entity132 max would mean creating an @entity113 and a federal government			0
‘ if the prime minister is saying that @entity7 could get more powers , that ’s certainly not something the government should do without consulting the people in @entity22			1
’ @entity17 mp @entity194 voiced the fears of many @entity168 that handing further powers to @entity7 would leave @entity22 voters with an even worse deal			2
he said : ‘ the @entity7 would still get our money , they ’d get all of the benefits of independence with none of the costs			0
to me , that ’s totally unacceptable			0
’ mr @entity2 admitted that as a wealthy @entity22 he might not be the best person to defeat the call for independence , and urged @entity210 heavyweights @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 to make the case for the union			0
he said : ‘ as for the fact that i am @entity22 , that i had a privileged upbringing , that i might annoy people by making a speech in @entity7 , all i can say is that this is what i believe			2
i care about our @entity55			0
‘ i am a unionist head , heart and soul			0
i believe that @entity22 , @entity7 , @entity23 and @entity24 are stronger together than they would ever be apart			0
’ in his speech , the @entity189 said @entity7 had been a ' pioneering country all its life ' but the @entity55 provided a ' stable home that billions envy '			1

@entity189 said @entity7 could have further devolution if they vote no to a breakaway
@entity18 still insists @entity7 people must vote on beefed - up powers
@entity2 says he is ' reading to fight for the life of this country '
