has she ever seen them close up ? heard their racist insults ? violence threats ? ' former @entity46 adviser and @entity35 parliamentary candidate @entity44 also tweeted : ' our communities will suffer the consequences of this legitimisation of the @entity3			0
@ bbcr4today - totally out of touch			0
' director of think tank @entity53 added : ' big @ @entity3 flaw to take at face value false statements from man with both violence & fraud convictions ' the @entity3 leader has returned to prominence following the killing of drummer @entity63 in @entity64 , which has led to an increase in @entity67 sentiments in some quarters			2
mr @entity2 , 30 , tried to strike a conciliatory tone over some issues , saying he condemned attacks against @entity20 and would not allow @entity3 members to make @entity74 salutes			1
however , he insisted that his group had nothing to do with a fire which partially destroyed an @entity17 community centre in @entity79 last week , even though the building was daubed with the initials ' @entity3 '			1
' if something was set fire and someone wrote " @entity89 " on the side of it , does it mean he did it ? , ' he said			0
' it just seems ridiculous to me and i think everyone can see through it that that 's done to make it look like the @entity7			0
' if i 'm honest , i 'm completely sceptical that it is even non-muslims that have done that			0
' mr @entity2 added : ' our tactics are completely questionable , yes , and i understand people who say you are going about it the wrong way , but what choice do we have as working - class people , who , as soon as you put your head above the parapet , you 're called a racist or a fascist ? who wants to sit down and talk to us ? ' he did not explain exactly what he meant by ' questionable tactics ' , but the @entity3 is known for holding large rallies near mosques and heavily @entity20 areas , while adopting a confrontational attitude which has previously led to clashes with anti-fascist protesters and @entity20 activists			1
' the non-muslim community working class do n't have a voice , ' he continued			0
' where will it end ? it 's not going to end pretty at the minute is it , when you look what 's going on			2
' memorial : @entity2 leaving a floral tribute to drummer @entity63 , whose death has led to a surge in the public attention paid to the @entity3 over the past few weeks the @entity3 leader went on to say that @entity20 should not be allowed to construct new places of worship until they implement a wholesale reform of their religion			1
' i 'd stop the building of mosques in this country until @entity17 reforms and works in this country with @entity146 democracy and freedom , ' he said			1
asked if he would condemn attacks by his members on @entity20 , he replied : ' utterly condemn it , disgraceful			2
' every single speech i gave since @entity64 , in fact in the last four years , condemn any acts of violence			0
so the only way to solve this is through democratic process , through peacefully protesting			0
' asked if he condemned any @entity3 member who gave a @entity74 salute , he said : ' well , i think if i was standing next to them there 'd be a violent act			1
if you look into our history , i was actually arrested for assaulting someone doing that at our demonstrations			0
' anger : but the @entity3 is dedicated to peaceful protest , according to its leader mr @entity2 mr @entity2 said that , if the @entity3 were in power , all @entity175 preachers would be automatically jailed , saying : ' when they 're calling for the implementation of @entity179 law and to overthrow our queen and our democracy , we 'd intern them			2
' he added that he believed his mission was to ' wake the @entity13 public up ' and alert people to the danger posed by @entity17 extremism , claiming , ' there 's 100 @entity179 law courts operating in this country			2
' while insisting that ' all face coverings should be banned in public ' , including @entity17 burqas and masks worn during protests , mr @entity2 said he understood why some @entity3 members covered their faces while demonstrating			1
' do you blame any person who 's got a job within a council , say , and lives near a @entity20 area , who wants to cover their face ? ' , he asked			0
he also claimed that he had been personally targeted by @entity17 radicals , saying : ' i myself have had four official @entity208 warnings , i 've been dragged out of my car , my children have been threatened to be decapitated			0
' attack : an @entity17 centre in @entity79 was burnt down and ' @entity3 ' was daubed on the side of the building but @entity216 columnist @entity215 said of allowing the leader on the show : ' woeful interview with convicted footie hoolie @entity220 aka @entity3 's @entity2			1
he 'll laugh all the way to next @entity3 brawl			0

' and @entity234 presenter and @entity236 political director @entity233 posted a blog with a list of ten questions he felt @entity24 presenter @entity37 could have asked but did not			0
he added : ' put to one side for a moment the vexed issue of whether ' preachers of hate ' such as @entity2 or @entity246 's @entity245 should even be given such high - profile platforms by national broadcasters			2
' the bigger issue with this particular interview was that there was very little probing of @entity2 's background or views ; his offensive and conspiratorial claims about @entity13 muslims and @entity17 were left largely unchallenged ; the tone of the questions was polite and - dare i say - soft , rather than tough , rigorous or challenging			1
' @entity260 member @entity259 tweeted : ' @entity262 interview with @entity3 leader @entity2 was shocking , poorly researched interview prep , didnt challenge his false claims ... ' earlier this year , mr @entity2 was briefly imprisoned after he was convicted of attempting to travel to the @entity265 using someone else 's passport			1
a @entity21 spokesman said : ' today 's programme looked at the recent rise in islamaphobic attacks , such as the recent arson attack on a @entity18 mosque			1
' the @entity21 has a responsibility to both report on the story and to try to offer insight into why it is happening			0
the @entity3 are a key part of the story and we believe it is important to reflect the fact that opinions such as those of @entity2 exist			2
' his views were challenged and we spoke to guests with alternative opinions elsewhere in the programme			0
