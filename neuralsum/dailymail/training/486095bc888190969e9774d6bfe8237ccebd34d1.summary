by @entity0 anyone traveling through @entity2 , @entity3 - a stone 's throw from the @entity7 border on the way to the exact middle of nowhere - might be shocked to find an enormous pyramid jutting above the horizon			1
as well they should be - this is @entity3 , not @entity14			0
but this @entity16 pyramid was once home to one of the @entity16 military 's anti-ballistic missile defense system with the @entity22 - era goal of shooting down @entity24 missiles before they ever reached their intended targets - and likely killing thousands of @entity16			1
the @entity2 pyramid is part of a cluster of military facilities once known as the @entity30 , named after @entity32 air defense commanding general @entity31			2
the @entity30 's pyramid served as its @entity53 base that essentially scanned all directions in search of airborne objects that may pose a threat to the @entity16 the pyramid - shaped radar facility was complete with 30 @entity47 missiles and 16 of the shorter - range @entity49 missiles , all of which were held in underground launch silos			1
the location of the pyramid is cryptically explained as ' @entity66 ; southeast of @entity67 ' - a sparsely populated section of one of the most sparsely populated states in the @entity16 as a whole , the @entity30 was armed with launch and control pads for 30 lim - 49 @entity47 anti-ballistic missiles , and 70 shorter - range @entity49 anti-ballistic missiles in support of the @entity32 's @entity77 anti-ballistic missile program			1
video from @entity79 launch sites : the facility held icbms in several underground launch bunkers scattered throughout the complex general : @entity86 is named for @entity31 , a former commanding general of the @entity32 @entity87 on february 10 , 1976 , the site was officially deactivated - after less than a year of being operational			2
the @entity89 , however , has a stunning set of images that shows the various states of construction and completion			0
the photos were taken for the government by photographer @entity97 and initially reported by @entity98			0
in all , the complex provided launch and control for 30 lim - 49 @entity47 anti-ballistic missiles , and 70 shorter - range @entity49 anti-ballistic missiles the radar and site remain in service today as the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) , located at @entity108 short - lived : the complex was deactivated on 10 february 1976 after less than a year of operation .			0

the @entity30 became operational in 1975
the @entity30 's high - tech radars were housed in a pyramid - shaped building in rural @entity2 , @entity3
@entity86 was *designed* to detect @entity24 missiles
in 1976 , just a year after it became operational , the @entity118 was *closed*
