by @entity1 reporter published : 05:37 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 05:55 est , 8 august 2012 a boy who suffered a heart attack at the age of two was saved after doctors hoovered a deadly blood clot from his heart @entity8 has become the only child in the world to have the procedure , where a mini-vacuum is used to clear out the blocked artery and restore blood flow			1
it is regularly performed on adult heart attack victims but was previously unheard of in children			1
the two - year - old has now been discharged from @entity20 ’s @entity19 and is recovering with parents @entity21 and @entity23 at home in @entity25 , @entity26			2
pioneering : @entity8 just after heart surgery at nine months ( left ) and now happy and active ( right ) scientists were able to suck the blood clot out of the heart in under half an hour mrs @entity31 , 37 , said : ' the doctors were so excited			1
they were all just amazed			0
they said it ’s never been done before on a child			0
there are no words to explain how we feel about them and all the staff at the hospital			0
' they have saved his life			0
it ’s lovely he ’s back home and we can be a family again			0
' @entity8 was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome , where the left side of the heart does not form properly			1
at a week old , surgeons at @entity19 operated on his heart and he had further open heart surgery nine months later			1
doctors were pleased with his progress and were not due to see him until later this year			1
but a month ago , @entity8 suddenly collapsed at home after suffering chest pains			1
full - time mother @entity21 said : ' the night before we had been to a party in aid of the charity we set up after @entity8 ’s diagnosis			1
some of his doctors were there and everyone kept saying how good he looked			1
' the following morning , i was sat talking to a friend in the kitchen when his brother came in and said @entity8 did n’t feel very well			1
' he was grey and sweating			0
he kept saying : ‘ it hurts ’ and when i asked where he pointed to his heart			2
' thank you : @entity8 and his mother @entity21 who is grateful to dr @entity79 and the other medics who saved her son 's life his terrified parents immediately called for an ambulance and he was rushed to @entity85			1
the youngster was connected to a heart monitor and the readings were sent to @entity8 ’s team of doctors at @entity19			1
they spotted ‘ something they did n’t like ’ and he was quickly transferred to the intensive care unit at @entity19			0
@entity23 , 38 , an insurance broker , said : ' within an hour of getting there they realised he had heart failure			2
we were told the heart gives out a chemical when you are having a heart attack			2
a nursehad the reading on her hand and showed the doctors			2
' they were in disbelief			0
it ’s so rare for a child to have a heart attack			2
' @entity8 was given shots of clot busting drugs while doctors battled to save him			1
that evening , his parents were given the devastating news that he may not survive and if he did , he may need a heart transplant			2
over the next couple of days , they faced an agonising wait as doctors tried to stabilise his heart			1
@entity21 said : ' it was awful			0
he was going through hell			0
all we could do was sit by his bed and hope for a miracle			0
' you would do anything for your child just to make them better			0
the doctors then had a discussion and told us they wanted to try putting some dye in @entity8 ’s heart to see if there was a blockage			1
' we knew that there were huge risks to any intervention because @entity8 ’s heart function was so poor , and therefore anaesthetic was not really ideal , but we felt the only option was to have hope , be positive and give him the best chance of the best quality of life			1
' @entity8 as a baby with his siblings ( left to right ) @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			1
@entity8 's heart did not form properly in the womb @entity8 pictured at nine months old - his heart function improved immediately after his latest procedure @entity8 ’s surgeon mr @entity157 then came to his parents to say they had found a blood clot and asked for their permission to remove it			1
@entity23 said : ' we did n’t really hesitate			0
we have ultimate respect and huge amount of confidence in the team who look after @entity8 so when we met with mr @entity157 it felt right to go with the procedure as success would give @entity8 the best chance			1
' luckily , the adult cardiac team is based alongside the children ’s unit and dr @entity173 , a consultant adult interventional cardiologist , was asked to be on hand			0
although it had never been done before on a child , it was agreed the best option was to perform a percutaneous coronary intervention , where the clot is sucked out of the heart			2
@entity23 said : ' about 25 minutes later , another doctor came back with the blood clot in his hand			2
he said : ‘ we ’ve done it			0
' then the room was full of doctors			2
there was an all round feeling of relief and excitement			0
' not just for what this has done for @entity8 and the hope it gave to him , but what it meant for the future			1
' we met dr @entity173 the next day and he told us how excited he was about this			0
how paediatric cardiologists would learn from this and it could help others			0
' it felt special that our @entity8 had been part of something so big , and his life will go onto help others in the future			1
' @entity8 ’s heart function immediately improved and after 11 days in hospital he was allowed home			1
it is still not known what caused the clot but he will continue to be monitored regularly and will have to be on medication for the rest of his life			0
the couple , who also have four other children , @entity150 , 16 , @entity151 , 14 , @entity153 , 12 and six - year - old @entity152 , are campaigning to keep the children ’s cardiac care unit open			0
delight : @entity8 with his parents who faced an anxious wait to see if the pioneering surgery would work @entity8 with his father after he had surgery at just 10 - days old under current plans , it is due to close and patients from the @entity234 will be transferred to @entity235 , @entity236 or @entity237 where there may not be an adult unit			1
dr @entity173 , consultant adult interventional cardiologist at @entity19 , said : ' the procedure is called percutaneous coronary intervention , where the clot is removed to unblock the artery and allow the blood to flow back again through it			1
' i regularly perform this procedure on adults for patients presenting with acute heart attack			2
' as far as i and my colleagues are concerned , this has never been done on a child as heart attacks in children are rare			2
' it is a risky procedure because failure to aspirate the clot under general anaesthesia may result in death			0
it is more likely to be fatal for children with a condition like @entity8 ’s because he has a single chamber , where any damage by a heart attack is magnified			1
' it really is remarkable			0
at @entity19 , we have an excellent relationship between the adult and paediatric cardiologists , allowing such rare cases to be treated exceptionally well			0
' dr @entity274 , @entity8 ’s paediatric cardiology consultant , said she was very pleased with @entity8 ’s progress			1
she said : ' his heart function improved dramatically by the end of the procedure			2
' it ’s not back to normal yet but there is a very good chance he will get better for his third operation in a year ’s time			0
' it ’s great to see him running about and playing			0
