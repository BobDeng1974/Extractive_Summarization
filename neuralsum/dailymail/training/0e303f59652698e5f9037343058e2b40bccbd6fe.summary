by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:23 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:36 est , 17 december 2013 we may think of @entity4 as a brutish , primitive species , but a recent find suggests they were more thoughtful than we give them credit for			1
researchers claim a @entity4 skeleton unearthed in @entity11 over a century ago was intentionally buried			1
this is according to a 13 - year reanalysis of the site which suggests careful burials existed among the @entity4 50,000 years ago			1
a 13 - year re-analysis of a @entity11 cave suggests careful burials existed among @entity4 50,000 years ago scientists believe the friends and family of the @entity4 went to great care to dig a grave and protect his body			1
‘ this discovery not only confirms the existence of @entity4 burials in @entity29 , but also reveals a relatively sophisticated cognitive capacity to produce them , ’ said dr @entity24 , a paleontologist at @entity25			1
neanderthals were similar to early modern humans but belonged to a separate human sub-species			0
the two tribes co-existed for thousands of years in @entity29 before @entity4 vanished around 30,000 years ago , probably because they could not compete with the modern humans			1
the friends and family of the @entity4 went to great care to dig a grave and protect his body the concept that neanderthals carefully buried their dead fits with recent discoveries that they were capable of developing rich cultures			1
earlier this month , evidence was found that @entity4 lived in organised and tidy spaces - much in the same way as modern humans			2
investigation of three @entity4 levels at @entity49 , a collapsed rock shelter in north - west @entity51 , revealed how areas were divided up for different activities			2
the top level , containing animal remains , seemed to have been reserved for butchering animals			2
the middle level was a long - term sleeping area , and the bottom level a place for shorter stays			0
in the middle level , containing the most traces of human occupation , artefacts were distributed to avoid clutter around the hearth at the back of the cave			0
the findings centre on @entity4 remains first discovered by two brothers in 1908 at @entity72 in southwestern @entity11			1
the well - preserved bones led its early 20th - century excavators to believe the site marked a burial ground created by a predecessor to early modern humans			0
but their conclusions have sparked controversy in the scientific community ever since			0
skeptics maintain that the discovery had been misinterpreted and that the burial may not have been intentional			0
beginning in 1999 , dr @entity24 and his team began excavating seven other caves in the area			1
in this excavation , which was completed last year , the scientists found more @entity4 remains of two children and one adult along with bones of bison and reindeer			1
geological analysis of the hole in which the remains were found suggests that it was not a natural feature of the cave floor			2
as part of their study , the scientists also re-examined the human remains found in 1908			0
in contrast to the reindeer and bison remains at the site , the @entity4 remains contained few cracks , no weathering - related smoothing , and no signs of disturbance by animals			1
‘ the relatively pristine nature of these 50,000 - year - old remains implies that they were covered soon after death , strongly supporting our conclusion that @entity4 in this part of @entity29 took steps to bury their dead , ’ said dr rendu			1
the findings centre on @entity4 remains first discovered by two brothers in 1908 at @entity72 in southwestern @entity11 ‘ while we can not know if this practice was part of a ritual or merely pragmatic , the discovery reduces the behavioural distance between them and us			1

previous findings have shown that they probably decorated themselves using pigments , and wore jewellry made of feathers and colourful shells			0

the site showed how they arranged their living space , assigning separate areas for preparing food , making tools and socialising			0
