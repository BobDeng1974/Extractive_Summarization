by @entity0 down in the depths , a diver swims among cages of netting that look like underwater towers of @entity6			2
sitting inside the many ' floors ' of each one are giant @entity10 scallops that are keeping the delicate ecosystem in balance			2
the molluscs form part of an experimental aquatic farm devised by dr @entity16 from the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19			1
aware of the pollution in the farmed fish industry , he has come up with a ' polyculture ' system whereby only one species in the chain needs to be directly fed by him - as can be seen in this fascinating set of pictures from @entity31			2
@entity33 's own water filters , giant @entity10 scallops thrive on fish waste at an experimental farm off @entity19 's @entity36			1
the farm also uses sugar kelp to consume excretions from nearby pens of native sablefish in the @entity42 lie four shrimp cages owned by @entity44			1
each one can yield anything up to 13 tons of shrimp every four to six months off the coast of @entity36 , he only feeds sablefish ( also known as black cod ) , which are native to the @entity51			1
nearby hang the baskets containing scallops , along with oysters , mussels and cockles - which feed on the fish 's organic excretions			0
beyond them lie lines of sugar kelp - a brown algae used in sushi , and also as a component of bioethanol fuel			0
these plants mop up the rest of the waste by converting nitrates and phosphorus into plant tissue			0
diamond - shaped fish cages rise from the water for cleaning at @entity74 , the world 's largest open - ocean fish farm , eight miles off the @entity78 coast of @entity79 tilapia pens in @entity81 , the largest lake in the @entity82 , are choked by an algal bloom they helped create			1
the overstocked lake produces a large quantity of farmed fish , but excess nutrients trigger blooms that use up oxygen and kill fish the whole system acts like a giant water filter - and most importantly , it is a commercially viable proposition , as it can make extra food for fish farms			1
it 's self - sustainable and good for the environment			0
and for the fishing industry , that can only be a good thing			0
whereas fisheries deal with catching , processing and selling fish , aquaculture concerns the cultivation of aquatic animals and aquatic plants - and is also known as ' fish farming '			1
there have been concerns over the years about fish in fisheries being treated with antibiotics , for example , as well as disease from farmed fish being passed on to wild fish			1
and then there is the threat of coastal pollution via waste and pesticides			0
from @entity124 to the @entity82 and @entity125 , large - scale fish farms are an expanding global business			1
a diver nets a ten - pound cobia ( also known as black salmon ) for sampling before harvest in one of @entity74 's dozen offshore pens			0
able to hold hundreds of thousands of fish , but less densely stocked and better flushed than nearshore salmon pens , they produce little pollution world fisheries produced 158million tonnes in 2012 , of which almost 70million came from aquaculture			1
@entity44 is another who has embraced its principles			0
in the @entity42 , he can be found inspecting his four shrimp cages - each of which yield anything up to 13 tons of shrimp every four to six months			1
his enterprise is a far cry from traditional shrimp farms - where the hatcheries can give rise to disease - but it does rely on subsidies from the @entity124 government			1
meanwhile , eight miles off the coast of @entity79 , another diver nets a 10lb cobia for sampling before harvest			0
a graphic showing the amount of feed required to gain 1lb of body mass ; and right , the june issue of @entity31 magazine the fish , also known as the black salmon , is in one of 12 - odd offshore pens belonging to @entity74 - the largest offshore fish farm in the world			2
choc full with healthy omega - 3 fatty acids , the cobia is a highly valued seafood			0
but unlike holding areas nearer the shore ( often in coves ) , these pens , which can hold 40,000 fish , produce hardly any pollution , and are not densely stocked			2
@entity181 , president of @entity74 , has housed his salmon cages in deep water so that they are continually cleansed by the current - and he has n't yet needed to give them antibiotics			2
' this is the future ' , he told @entity31			0
' this is what the industry is going to have to do in order to keep growing , especially in the tropics			0
' the images are from the june issue of @entity31 .			0

giant natural water filter off @entity36 , @entity19 , devised to help reduce pollution on fish farms
in gulf of @entity201 , *unconventional* shrimp cages reduce disease
