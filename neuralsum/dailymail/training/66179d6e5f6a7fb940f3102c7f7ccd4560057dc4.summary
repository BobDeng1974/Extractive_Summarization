by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 after 120 bruising minutes and only a heartbreaking extra-time defeat against @entity4 to show for their efforts , it would be easy for both the @entity8 squad - and their legion of fans - to feel distraught after crashing out of the @entity11			1
the pain of tuesday night 's last 16 tie in @entity14 wo n't have disappeared just yet , but @entity15 and his players have plenty of reasons for optimism following arguably the bravest loss of the tournament so far			1
as veterans of the international scene @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 battled away at the @entity29 , @entity23 's bright young things were busy putting forward their country 's case as serious contenders for @entity33 in four years ' time			1
game over : @entity15 ( right ) reacts as @entity4 staff celebrate in the background down and out : @entity39 stars @entity40 ( centre ) and @entity28 ( right ) look dejected after defeat finally beaten : goalkeeper @entity27 looks glum after conceding a @entity44 goal in extra-time @entity46 , only 19 - years - old and making his first appearance in @entity48 , scored with his opening touch to set up a dramatic finish against @entity52 ' much - fancied side			1
and although @entity15 's men could n't beat @entity55 again to force a penalty shootout , they deserve to leave @entity23 with both pride and hope for the future			1
the impact of the young @entity62 forward , who controlled @entity65 's pinpoint pass with a brilliant first - time volley to reduce his side 's two - goal deficit , gave supporters a glimpse of the country 's emerging talent			1
with talisman @entity26 now 31 and the international career of record goalscorer @entity74 seemingly over , @entity46 will be expected to become a major part of @entity8 's attacking force			2
the early signs suggest he 's ready to do just that			0
born in @entity80 to an @entity82 father and a @entity84 mother , the versatile forward was picked up by the @entity85 giants @entity62 in 2010 and made his first team debut as a late substitute in a @entity89 tie against @entity90 last november			0
he represented @entity91 at various youth levels before being talked into swapping allegiances by @entity15 , who has focused on convincing a number of players with dual nationality to start wearing the famous stars and stripes			2
instant impact : youngster @entity46 scores a volley to set up a dramatic finish in @entity14 back in it : @entity46 's strike beats @entity4 goalkeeper @entity55 at the @entity29 bright future : @entity46 , who plays for @entity84 side @entity62 , runs off to celebrate his first @entity11 goal speaking about @entity46 after his side 's narrow defeat , @entity15 said : ' we knew that he was ready			1
' he knew that he might get his chance today			0
it was just phenomenal the way he came in and scored that goal and gets us back			0
' we just needed a little bit more			0
it was fun to watch that kid grow			0
' and grow he will			0
@entity46 netted 15 goals in 23 games for @entity62 's second team last season , exhibiting his natural ability in front of goal in his first campaign as a professional			2
he has been linked with a move to @entity128 side @entity127 in some quarters , although it is highly unlikely that @entity131 would sanction a permanent transfer for one his club 's most promising players			0
fortunately for @entity15 , who wants to stay on as @entity8 boss until at least the next @entity11 , @entity46 is n't the only youngster threatening to mark his mark on the international stage for years to come			2
big impression : young defender @entity140 ( left ) was a contender for @entity141 after coming on no way through : @entity140 ( left ) , who plays for @entity143 , tackles @entity4 striker @entity144 devastated : @entity143 star @entity140 is left on the turf after the @entity8 failed to find an equaliser on tuesday @entity140 replaced injured right - back @entity147 after 32 minutes in @entity14 and , after the excellent @entity27 in the @entity8 's goal , was easily the game 's most impressive performer			1
the 20 - year - old , who reportedly earns just £ 60,000 a year playing for @entity143 in @entity151 , rampaged down @entity4 's left - side , giving @entity154 defender @entity153 his most difficult game of the @entity11 so far			1
up against the likes of @entity157 and @entity44 , @entity140 's commitment to getting forward , beating his man and delivering dangerous crosses was a breath of fresh air			2
his energy levels barely dipped despite his constant forays into @entity4 's half and he dealt impressively with the attacking threat posed by @entity52 ' expansive side , something noticed by his team - mate @entity27			1
more to come : @entity15 has reasons for optimism with talented young players continuing to emerge ' he ’s fearless			2
he ’s strong , he ’s fast , ' said the @entity175 stopper			0
' ( @entity177 ) hazard is no cake walk and i thought he handled him really , really well			0
obviously , as the team got tired , we opened up , but when you talk about one - on - one , he won those battles			0
' @entity15 has proved his credentials as an organiser and man - motivator , but with @entity46 and @entity140 , plus @entity65 , @entity147 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 all coming into their prime or still developing , the future for the national team looks even brighter			1
winning the 2018 @entity11 may still be a few of steps too far for @entity196 , but you certainly would n't bet against this now football - mad nation continuing their development on the biggest stage .			0

@entity39 lost 2 - 1 to @entity4 after extra-time in their last 16 tie
@entity15 's side put in a strong *performance* and almost took the game to a penalty shootout
@entity46 came off the bench to score his country 's goal
@entity140 impressed after replacing @entity147 in the first half
@entity39 have reasons to be optimistic for the future
