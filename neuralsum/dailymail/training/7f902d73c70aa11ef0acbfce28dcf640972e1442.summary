she returned to @entity57 shortly after and moved in to the @entity58 , which was doubling as the @entity60 's @entity1 headquarters at the time			0
she soon began an affair with a senior @entity64 officer by the name of baron @entity66 and became so closely acquainted with the @entity68 upper echelons that she was sent to @entity70 in 1943 where she exploited her past acquaintance with @entity49 to try and strike a truce with @entity74 officers stationed there			1
@entity49 allegedly ignored the offer , with historian @entity76 saying @entity3 ' displayed incredible megalomania and naivety in imagining that she could change @entity49 's mind			0
