@entity0 has warned @entity1 that the biggest threat to him remaining prime minister at the next election emanates not from within but from being ' foolish enough ' to disrespect and underestimate the man sitting on the opposite side of the house , @entity6			1
talk in political circles has increasingly focused on the growing popularity and leadership qualities of foreign minister @entity12 , notwithstanding the continued steady support of communications minister @entity14 , and the flagging public backing for the pm			2
@entity0 , @entity16 's second longest serving prime minister , was discussing his new book ' the @entity18 ' ( about the country 's longest serving @entity3 , sir @entity20 ) with @entity21 on tuesday and had this advice for the incumbent : ' any opposition leader should be taken seriously			1
that ’s my view , anybody in government who is foolish enough to dismiss an opposition leader will often pay a very heavy price			1
' @entity0 ( left ) and @entity1 pictured together earlier this year at the official opening of the ' @entity34 ' exhibition in @entity35 foreign minister @entity12 with @entity1 at the @entity37 executive meeting			2
despite her increasing popularity , the @entity3 's main concern should be at the threat posed by opposition leader @entity6 to his leadership , according to @entity0 ' treat your opponent with both caution and respect '			1

he , not perceived threats from within the party , is @entity1 's greatest cause for concern in trying to retain the @entity52 at the next election @entity1 ( left ) in 2013 and @entity0 ( right ) in 2001 celebrate election day success @entity56 and @entity55 meet the daughter of @entity59 president @entity58 in 1959			1
@entity60 would later also go on to lead her country @entity0 's most respected @entity63 prime minister was @entity64			1
when asked , he unhesitatingly nominated mr @entity64 saying ' i would put him ahead of all the others ' ' the @entity63 ridiculed @entity1 when he became @entity6 , they said he was unelectable , they said he was this , that and the other , he won and he proved them wrong , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' my advice to the @entity37 is treat your opponent with both caution and respect			2
' while he rated the man who followed him as @entity3 an ' eight out of 10 ' for his first year in the top job , mr @entity0 added : ' i think he is experiencing what so many prime ministers do in their early years , he ’s had his setbacks , he ’s got a difficult @entity82 but he has achieved a lot of his major commitments and i think he ’ll be able to ride through the adversity '			1
' that ’ll be a test of him , like every prime minister , he ’ll be tested by events and judged accordingly but my assessment of his personality and intelligence is that he ’ll handle those events effectively			2
' every prime minister has difficulties in the early years , i did , @entity20 did , there ’s a common and erroneous belief about @entity20 that once he was elected in 1949 he just governed without hindrance for 16 years – that was n’t the case			2
he had a very up and down time			0
' there ’s nothing unusual about a prime minister having some choppy weather in his early years			0
in fact , prime ministers have choppy weather through most of their years , unless their opponents are split badly and become unelectable			0
' mr @entity0 's follow - up book to the best - selling ' @entity109 ' charts the history of @entity16 under the leadership of @entity20 , whose first foray as @entity3 actually ended in tears ; when ' he suffered the ignominy of losing the prime ministership , something that most people saw as the end of his political career '			1
but he returned , in triumph , to not only form the @entity37 but to go on and govern for another 16 years , between 1949 and 1966			0
@entity20 leads sir @entity121 and @entity123 captain @entity122 from the field at the @entity3 's @entity125 in @entity35 , 1963			2
like his predecessor , @entity0 has a deep affinity for the game mr @entity0 shares a joke with another former prime minister in @entity131 ( right ) at the @entity132 in @entity133 @entity0 came up against several @entity134 during his tenure as @entity3 , here he shakes hands with then @entity63 leader @entity137 ahead of the 2004 ballot mr @entity0 speaking about his new book ' the @entity18 ' at the @entity140 last month as for the widely publicised @entity142 breakway from the @entity143 this past week and the general rise of minor parties , mr @entity0 said the political landscape had changed and , it is a challenge for the major parties to come to terms with it			1
' it is a question of whether it is a good thing or a bad thing in the sense that it ’s what the people want and from time to time people will express their dissatisfaction with the two major parties by voting for smaller parties and that ’s the democratic process , ' he said			0
' you do n’t try and react to it by thinking you can change the rules to stop it happening , you wo n’t achieve that and you should n’t try to			0
' what you should do is try and address the reasons why people are disenchanted with the 2 major parties and that ’s a responsibility of my party and obviously a responsibility for the @entity63			0
' but he 's equally sure there is no real need for a third major party , as @entity16 once boasted			2
' i think you need a strong two - party system and i think the nature of modern politics is that fewer people are rusted on to the respective sides of politics and you have what i called detachable flanks of 10 to 15 per cent of voters on either side who go off at various stages , ' mr @entity0 added			1
' i do n’t think you will see a third party emerging which is the equal of either the @entity63 or the @entity190 but you will for some time , for the foreseeable future you will have this detachment on the two sides of politics			0
' when i was first involved in politics there was a 40/40/20 rule that 40 per cent were always @entity190 , 40 per cent were always @entity63 and 20 per cent in the middle			0
' one sometimes feels now that it ’s 30/30/40 , that there are a lot more people prone to change between elections , there are fewer people who are rusted on to either side of politics and that will produce the phenomena that we now have , if it ’s not the @entity143 it will be something else in the future , it ’s just a feature of @entity16 politics now			0
' i do n’t think it will lead to a formation of a party which is the equal of or even a serious rival to the @entity63 or the @entity190			0
' ' the @entity18 ' charts the 23 year period from 1949 to 1972 when the @entity190 held office in @entity16 , winning seven elections in a row with sir @entity20 taking the lead for much of that period while he warned the @entity190 against underestimating those on the other side of the chamber , mr @entity0 agreed there are parallels between the @entity63 which @entity20 confronted and what has occurred within the @entity63 in recent years			1
' there ’s no doubt that he ( @entity20 ) benefited enormously from the @entity63 split and the @entity63 was unelectable for a full decade , literally unelectable , they were in terrible shape , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' he was very fortunate in that sense and the @entity63 was a better disciplined organisation in the 80s and 90s and onwards than what it was in the 1950s			0
' it ’s certainly been a shambles quite recently but not as cataclysmic as the split , the split in the 1950s caused enormous bitterness that lasted for a generation			2
' but he did have kind words for one @entity63 leader , unhesitatingly nominating @entity64 as the @entity63 prime minister he most respected			0
i think he was more successful as a @entity63 prime minister than any of the others			0
the @entity63 prime ministers i dealt with ... i came in when @entity249 was @entity3 and then @entity243 and @entity131 , then @entity250 and @entity251 and @entity250 again , so i would put him ahead of the others , ' mr @entity0 said			1
the former @entity3 also backed @entity1 's so - called shirt - front tactics against @entity255 president @entity254 over the @entity257 tragedy , claiming ' i think @entity1 ’s rhetoric is quite justified '			1
mr @entity0 , the nation 's 25th pm , spent the best part of two and a half years in the labour of love which was researching and writing of the @entity20 era			1
for now though , he says , he 'll focus on promoting his latest works , while keeping a close eye on his beloved @entity16 cricket eleven trying to score more success over the summer			0
another piece of prose , however , may not be too far away			0
he concluded by comparing being interviewed as an author to being grilled as a politician			0
' there are similarities in both			0
you are asked to recall what you have written in one iteration and you are asked to recall what you have said in another , ' mr @entity0 said .			1

@entity0 's warning to @entity1 it would be ' foolish ' to dismiss @entity6 as a real threat
urged his successor as a @entity3 to show respect to the @entity6 to avoid paying ' a very heavy price '
mr @entity0 recently finished writing his second book in his *post-political* life , ' the @entity18 '
