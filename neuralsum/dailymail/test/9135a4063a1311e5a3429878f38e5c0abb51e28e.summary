@entity0 has challenged his @entity2 players to relieve the pressure on their shoulders by adding another dent to @entity7 's @entity6 hopes			1
the @entity8 have slipped to seven points adrift of fourth - placed @entity10 as a result of successive defeats by @entity13 and @entity14 , although things could have been worse had the champions managed to emerge from monday night 's trip to @entity18 with something to show for their efforts			0
@entity23 ' men ended their mini-slump on wednesday evening with a 1 - 0 @entity26 quarter - final replay victory at @entity27 , and @entity0 knows they will will determined to add three points to that to keep alive their hopes of a top - four finish when the @entity33 head for @entity34 on monday evening			2
@entity0 says his players need to relieve the pressure of their shoulders with a win against @entity7 he said : ' they are only seven points off it , i think , and they 'll think they have still got a chance , seven points off it with seven games to go			1
' i remember our football club having a huge gap for ( to win ) the championship and it dwindling away , so anything is possible			0
' they 'll think they 've still got a chance of getting into that top four , and i 'll be very surprised if the manager does n't prepare his team thinking like that , so we know we are going to have a difficult game			0
@entity23 and his side have slipped out of the top four and out of @entity6 contention ' but there 's a bit of pressure on ourselves as well			2
' that pressure comes specifically because of sunday 's 1 - 0 derby defeat at @entity67 , the @entity33 ' fifth successive reverse in the fixture , but more generally as a result of a run of 13 games in all competition under their current head coach which has brought just two victories			0
@entity2 have not added to their points tally of 35 since they beat @entity79 on february 28 , some four games ago , and have scored just once in the process			0
the @entity2 boss looks increasingly unlikely to get the job , with his results failing to impress they remain nine points clear of the relegation zone , but with @entity91 challengers @entity89 heading for @entity92 next weekend , the situation could get worse before it gets better			0
@entity0 's cause has not been helped by an injury and suspension list which at some points has robbed him of an entire xi , and while there is light at the end of the tunnel for midfielders @entity103 and @entity105 , the trip to @entity107 will come too soon			1
@entity0 said : ' i would say @entity103 is certainly ahead of @entity105 at the moment , but neither of those guys will be available this weekend			1
' @entity103 ( left ) and @entity105 are back in training but wo n't be available for monday night			1

@entity0 says his players must lift the pressure with a victory
