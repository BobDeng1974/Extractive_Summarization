' is he dead ' ? not quite , but that 's the reaction many shared when they watched @entity5 runner @entity4 plunge through the air before ploughing face - first into the side of a shipping container			1
mr @entity4 , from @entity9 , was attempting the last leap of a routine @entity5 run up and down several shipping containers before completely misjudging the final hurdle			1
after pacing through the circuit at speed , @entity4 had just one last leap to make but slipped in the process - smashing his face on the side of the steel container			1
a friend , who filmed the whole incident from behind , found the lost tooth on the ground when he went to help mr @entity4 but let him know that it was likely he was in for more than just a headache			2
' that 's going to cost quite a few f * * * * ing dollars to replace mate , ' he said , staring down into his wide smile			0
' @entity43 , i 'll drive you to the hospital			0
' mr @entity4 required three stitches in the incident but was lucky not to do more serious damage when he fell limp to the ground after the failed jump			0
it is understood prior to jumping off the container mr @entity21 slipped and lost his footing he subsequently misjudged the distance between the two containers ploughing face first the side @entity28 participants run through urban areas jumping and tumbling between built objects mr @entity62 hit his face and then fell limp to the ground below he â€™d apparently done the jump twice before , but this time his shoes were wet and he lost grip when he when to push off from a standing start			1

@entity84 said it was @entity5 suicide to jump from a standing start			1
' looks like when he went up to do the jump , his feet were right behind the shallow trim on the sides , so when he jumped , his feet caught on it and his body flew in front , ' @entity92 said			0
' moral of the story : standing jumps kill people , do running jumps always			0
' responding to his online pasting , mr @entity21 said injuries are part of the sport and that he was n't a ' @entity5 wannabe '			2
' we 've been training for years but this was an accidental slip , ' he said			0
the damage bill awaiting @entity62 after his epic @entity5 fail the tooth mr @entity4 's friend friend retrieved from the ground after coming to the realisation that he had no front tooth , the pain started to settle in for mr @entity116			1

@entity21 was jumping between shipping containers on a @entity5 run
he was being filmed from behind by a friend when he smashed his face against the steel container unit
he 's attempted the run twice before but *claimed* his feet slipped when he attempted the standing - start jump
his friend retrieved his broken tooth and told him just how much it was likely to cost in dental costs
@entity5 is a sport where participants free - run through urban and jump across certain objects
