by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 04:30 est , 30 september 2013 a strange second ' moon ' orbiting the @entity3 that has baffled astronomers for the last month , is actually of human origin , scientists said			2
the mysterious object known as ' 2013 @entity7 ' was spotted in august as part of the @entity10 asteroid survey in @entity11 and immediately caught the attention of researchers who noticed it is orbiting the @entity3 and wanted to know its identity			1
scientists at the @entity18 observing the near @entity3 object moving in an @entity3 - centred orbit were keen to find out whether it was natural or artificial			1
the mysterious object can be seen moving in a gif below			2
the scientists suspect the object is part of a rocket stage , similar to the labeled part on the rocket pictured scientists came up with various theories to explain the identity of the moving ' dot ' shown on a screen ( above ) , ranging from an asteroid caught in a wide orbit around the @entity3 , to a piece of space debris or even a small second moon			1
however , the mystery was solved by staff at the @entity18 's @entity42 , who tracked the object with an @entity46 telescope with help from researchers at the @entity49			0
@entity50 , a member of the team , said that finding the object ' was a bit of a challenge , because the object was moving fast ' compared to a typical near @entity3 object			0
the scientists declared the object ' artificial ' and think it is very probably part of a booster stage rocket			1
it is not the first time that scientists have rediscovered a lost rocket stage close to the edge of the earth 's gravitational reach			0
when the third stage of the @entity73 mission failed to crash on the @entity74 as planned , it drifted through space and then orbited the @entity3 , before being rediscovered in 2002			0
its man - made origin was revealed by analysing the light reflected by the rocket body , which did not resemble that of an asteroid , but rather revealed the titanium - enriched white paint used at that time for the @entity84 rockets			0
however , the process to identify 2013 @entity7 was trickier			1
scientists came up with various theories to explain the identity of the mysterious near @entity3 object , ranging from an asteroid caught in a wide orbit around the @entity3 , to a piece of space debris or even a small second moon			1
our own @entity3 and its one true moon is pictured dr @entity50 said : ' despite the difficulties , observations were made with an instrument called @entity100 , for " @entity101 for the @entity102 , " which allowed us to obtain the object â€™s spectrum			0
' the spectrum bore strong similarities with the spectra of previously observed space junk such as discarded rocket stages , abandoned boosters or defunct satellite , @entity18 said			2
@entity112 , who is responsible for @entity42 activities at @entity18 's @entity115 programme office , said : ' the observations by @entity118 astronomers coordinated by @entity18 demonstrated a very quick reaction in getting high - quality data that conclusively identified the object as artificial , and hence no threat			0

the mysterious object known as ' 2013 @entity7 ' was spotted in august as part of the @entity10 asteroid survey in @entity11
*international* scientists came up with different theories to explain its identify *including* an asteroid , a piece of space debris and even a small second moon
@entity18 *confirmed* the object is artificial and think it is very probably part of a booster stage rocket
