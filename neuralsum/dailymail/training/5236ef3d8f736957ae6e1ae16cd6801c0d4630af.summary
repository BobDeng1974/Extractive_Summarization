workers in @entity1 face a ‘ lost decade ’ of falling pay as wages rise slower than prices , according to a report			0
average earnings will be more than £ 1,000 , or five per cent lower in 2017 than they were in 2008 once inflation has been taken into account			1
the figures , put together by economic forecasters the @entity12 , highlight the so - called ‘ cost - of - living crisis ’ gripping families across the country in the aftermath of the financial crash			1
after inflation has been taken into account , it fell to £ 17,713 last year and is expected to drop to £ 17,611 this year before edging up to £ 17,827 in 2017			2
but that is still £ 1,025 , or 5.4 per cent lower , than in 2008 , leaving @entity1 families worse off than they were before the crisis struck			1
the report comes at a particularly sensitive time during the final party conference season before the @entity34 in may , with living standards set to be a major issue between now and polling day			2
@entity38 , senior economic adviser to the @entity12 , said : ‘ households are facing a lost decade of real wage growth which will mean consumer spending growth will be low by historic standards ‘ total household incomes have strengthened because more people are in work but individuals do not have extra money in their pockets			0
the figures highlight the so - called ‘ cost - of - living crisis ’ gripping families across the country in the aftermath of the financial crash ‘ we expect this trend to continue for several years to come and it will be mirrored with a slowdown in consumer spending growth			1
’ workers across a wide range of incomes are feeling the pain , according to the report			0
those in the bottom 10 per cent will have seen take - home pay fall from £ 7,361 in 2008 to £ 7,077 in 2017 , while those in the top 10 per cent will have seen earnings drop from £ 37,735 to £ 35,632			2
mr @entity38 added : ‘ the squeezed middle is also going to continue to struggle , as limited growth in disposable incomes , reflecting weak pay rises and the threat of jobs being automated , leaves them no choice but to remain frugal with spending			0
’ a separate report by the @entity79 shows the cost - of - living crisis started under the last @entity82 government in 2007			1
economist @entity83 , who wrote the report , said : ‘ it would be disingenuous to blame this cost of living crisis on the @entity85 , since the decline in real living standards clearly began earlier			1
’ and @entity88 , director of the @entity79 , said : ‘ the deterioration in living standards is a clear consequence of @entity82 ’s mismanagement of the economy			2
‘ but if @entity96 ’s famous question – “ are you better off than you were four years ago ” – were to be asked today , the answer for most people in @entity1 would be “ no ”			0
coupled with the fragility of economic recovery , the @entity85 must resist the temptation to be complacent			0
much more needs to be done			0

average earnings will be five per cent lower in 2017 than 2008 after inflation
' cost - of - living ' crisis continues to grip families in aftermath of financial crash
economists say decline in living standards down to ' @entity82 mismanagement '
