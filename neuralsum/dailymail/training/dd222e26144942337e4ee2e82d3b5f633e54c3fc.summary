these dazzling images reveal the night sky as it is seldom seen from a city of 5million people			0
photographer @entity4 spends more than two hours per shot painstakingly capturing the movement of thousands of stars across the void , with spectacular results			1
while images of ' star trails ' - caused by the earth 's rotation when photographed on a long exposure - are common , the 36 - year - old digitally enhances his images taken in @entity16 and combines several together to create the otherworldly final effect			1
mr @entity4 began taking astronomical images after he accidentally captured the @entity19 in 2012 , on a visit to @entity21 in @entity22			1
' people are generally sceptical on star trails images taken in @entity16 because the city is heavily light polluted , ' he said			2
' many people do n't believe such incredible star images can be taken here			0
' in my shots , however , you can see the awe - inspiring views i 've witnessed			0
' however , he added : ' i see myself as an artist rather than a journalist , so some of my images may not make the purists happy			0
in order to create high quality night sky images , almost all of the images need to go through @entity42			0
' the post processing process becomes more tedious if images are captured in a heavily light polluted city like @entity16			2

' spectacular : the images look like a majestic multi-coloured firework or a painting , and are achieved by digitally knitting long - exposure shots together into one photo all lit up : mr @entity4 began taking astronomical images after he accidentally captured the @entity19 in 2012 , on a visit to @entity21 in @entity22 bridge to the sky : this image was captured in @entity64 , @entity16 , where many of mr @entity4 's friends were sceptical because of the amount of light pollution he said : ' i see myself as an artist rather than a journalist , so some of my images may not make the purists happy			1
almost all of the images need to go through @entity42 ' edge of the world : a lighthouse in @entity80 , @entity16			0
the stars can be millions of light years away and are given a spiral effect by slowly rotating the camera like a rainbow : star trails can be captured on long - exposure shots because the earth 's rotation means the rest of the sky appears to move in relation to the ground fiery : this shot at @entity21 , @entity22 , would have comprised at least three different images digitally stitched together to achieve different levels of light perfect circle : mr @entity4 said ' many people do n't believe such incredible star images can be taken ' in light - polluted @entity16 - so he set about trying to prove them wrong			1
