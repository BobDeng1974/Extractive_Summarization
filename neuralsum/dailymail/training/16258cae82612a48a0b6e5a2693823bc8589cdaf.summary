shoppers could be told how their meat has been killed , with labels on the packaging informing them over whether the animal was ' stunned ' or ' unstunned ' , a government minister has suggested			1
@entity7 , the parliamentary under - secretary of state for farming , food and the marine environment , suggested labels such as ' stunned ' on the packaging would give a ' clear definition ' to consumers			1
it comes amid an ongoing row about halal meat and the way it is packaged and presented to customers			1
it also emerged that major supermarkets such as @entity35 , @entity36 's , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 were selling the imported meat , while popular restaurant chains such as @entity42 had been serving halal chicken without making it clear on the menu			1
halal meat comes from the traditional @entity49 method of slaughtering but is controversial because animals are killed by having their throats cut and then having their blood drained			1
the @entity54 is set to report early next year on whether meat sold in the @entity56 should be labelled			1
but mr @entity7 suggested this week that meat products could be labelled ' stunned ' or ' unstunned , which would effectively alert shoppers as to whether their meat was killed according to religious guidelines			1
according to @entity62 , mr @entity7 told @entity63 : ' [ backbenchers have ] made the point that it would be wrong just to label meat as ' stunned ' or ' unstunned ' , and that a fairer way would be to list all the different methods of slaughter			1
' the only thing i would say in response is that , from the @entity56 perspective , ' stunned ' has a clear legal definition in the legislation , and it is simply that an animal is rendered insensible to pain almost immediately			1
' mr @entity7 has suggested labels such as ' stunned ' or ' unstunned ' for meat packaging , to give customers clear information over whether the meat is halal ( pictured ) or non-halal and suitable under religious guidelines he also said it would be ' difficult ' to brand meat products either kosher or halal because ' there is no single definition of halal ' and that a ' further complication is that not all meat slaughtered by kosher methods is deemed kosher '			1
and he added that it would be complicated to list all of the different methods of slaughter , and said there may not be a ' huge consumer appetite ' to do so			0
halal halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade , while a @entity49 butcher recites a religious verse			0
all blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under @entity113 law			0
under @entity113 law , an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious			0
@entity116 in comparison , the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed			0
it means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death , as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn - out pain and suffering			0
once the animal has been killed at the abattoir , it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered			0
@entity131 according to the laws , in order for a meat to be kosher it must come from an animal that is ruminant and have split hooves			0
ruminant animals chew food once and swallow , before regurgitating it and chewing again			0
before slaughtering , the animal must be healthy and uninjured and a sharp knife is used to slice through the main arteries and windpipe , causing a drop in blood pressure that causes the animal to lose consciousness			0
@entity150 , the shadow environment minister , said the labelling of meat had been ' roundly and rightly rejected ' by @entity63 last year			1
however , he said that if all different types of slaughter should be labelled then ' make room on the label for slaughter by electrical current , or by carbon dioxide , inert gas , captive bolt pistol , gunshot or free bullet and so on			0
' ' some advocate doing so , and it would certainly satisfy the need for transparency , ' he added			0
the row over the labelling of halal meat was sparked in may when it emerged millions of people were being sold halal and kosher meat without being told			1
several restaurants such as @entity42 , @entity174 and @entity175 were found to be selling halal meat – mainly chicken – without printing the information on menus			2
chains including @entity181 's , @entity182 , @entity183 's , @entity174 , ask and @entity184 also admitted to using halal meat in some dishes , mainly chicken , and locations			2
at least ten top higher education establishments - including @entity190 and the @entity191 – were also found to be secretly serving up meat from potentially unstunned animals			2
in @entity195 , 85 per cent of all meat served was found to unlabelled halal meal , while all the chicken served at universities in @entity200 and @entity201 - which is halal - was not marked as so			2
@entity203 and @entity204 were also found to be among the universities serving significant quantities of the meat , without telling consumers			2
it also emerged that most of the major supermarkets were selling @entity212 lamb killed according to halal ritual without providing labels			2
the switch to slaughtering animals in line with @entity113 ritual helps supermarket chains save money because the end product can be eaten by @entity49 and @entity223 alike			0
both halal and kosher slaughter involve a religious ritual in which the throat is cut			0
but some animals are not stunned beforehand , which is said to leave them in pain			0
the ongoing row about halal meat and the way it is packaged and presented to customers was sparked in may , after it was revealed millions of people were being sold halal and kosher meat without being told ( file picture ) in conventional slaughterhouses , cows , sheep and chicken are stunned , usually with an electric shock , to ensure they are unconscious before their throats are cut			1
this is said to minimise their suffering			0
after it emerged that halal was widely sold unknowingly to consumers , mr @entity27 demanded better labelling of meat			1
he said that while he personally had ' no problem ' eating halal meat , produce should be clearly labelled because ' consumers want to know more about how the food arrived on their plate			1
' religious groups from all faiths , vets and animal welfare groups have also previously joined calls for new labels to identify halal or kosher meat .			2

environment minister said meat could be labelled ' stunned ' or ' unstunned '
@entity7 suggested it would give a ' clear definition ' to consumers
