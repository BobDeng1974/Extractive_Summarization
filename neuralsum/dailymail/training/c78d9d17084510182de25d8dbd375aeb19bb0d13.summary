all the elements required for a proper party were present and correct at @entity2			1
amid the tickertape and the fireworks , and in front of heroes old and new , @entity4 ’s side signed off their season with little touches of class			2
@entity2 resounded to the celebration of three - in - a - row long before @entity13 hoisted the @entity16 trophy high above his head			1
with 102 goals scored and 99 points amassed – 20 more than last season – this has been about as convincing a title defence as it is possible to stage			0
many of the reasons why were on display as @entity26 were vanquished to ensure the optimum atmosphere in which to toast another triumph			1
party @entity29 : @entity13 ( centre ) lifts the @entity16 trophy , @entity33 's 45th league triumph legend : @entity35 , a former @entity33 captain , addresses the crowd after the match give me that : @entity33 player @entity40 celebrates with club mascot @entity41 and the trophy kiss of victory : @entity33 captain @entity13 celebrates with the @entity16 trophy party time : @entity33 players celebrate in the home dressing room after receiving the trophy splash : the champagne is opened in the @entity33 dressing room as the players celebrate their title win the resistance of the @entity58 side was broken by a 21st goal of the season for @entity61 , who has been a key element of the @entity33 attack			1
even more prolific has been double player of the year award winner @entity64 , so it was fitting he should net the final goal of their campaign to hoist his personal tally to a remarkable 32			1
in between , there was time for the distribution of a leaving gift			0
having emerged from the bench to win a penalty , @entity40 was handed the honour by regular taker commons			1
he made no mistake to draw an individual ovation from the crowd that appeared to leave him with tears in his eyes			0
the @entity84 international is out of contract and claims he is departing after six - and - a - half years because of the lack of a formal offer from the @entity33 hierarchy			1
an unfortunate own goal from @entity90 was the only small negative during the match , but it was rendered irrelevant by the time @entity94 and @entity35 emerged to lead the presentation party after full - time			1
both men , who have fought serious health issues , are former team - mates of @entity4 from the days when @entity99 and @entity100 filled the manager ’ s role			0
the current incumbent has now joined @entity100 , @entity104 and @entity105 in an elite band of @entity33 bosses to have won three successive championships			1
with a sea of green flags swaying in the stands , @entity4 was given a cheer as loud as any			0
@entity26 , of course , hope to have a party of their own back here on saturday			2
and their team selection was hugely influenced by that impending date with destiny in the @entity120 final against @entity121			0
showing off the silverware : @entity33 trio @entity123 ( 2nd left ) , @entity13 ( centre ) and @entity126 friends reunited : @entity33 manager @entity4 ( left ) is congratulated by former team - mate @entity94 here you are : @entity33 assistant manager @entity129 ( centre ) receives his medal from @entity94 we are family : @entity33 's @entity64 ( 2nd left ) poses for the cameras with girlfriend @entity136 and his children spot prize : @entity40 scores a penalty in what is probably his last game for @entity33 heading for a celebration : @entity61 ( right ) nods in @entity33 's opening goal @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 all started on the bench as @entity149 gave vital legs some additional rest before a game that could define their season			1
@entity4 changed more than half of his side following the midweek 3 - 3 draw with @entity121 , but that was a case of restoring @entity33 far closer to full strength			1
the only real surprise was a first start since september 2012 for @entity162 youngster @entity90 , who was asked to slot in at left - back			0
all in the @entity2 side wore black armbands in memory of little @entity168 , the five - year - old @entity33 fan who passed away earlier this week after a two - and - a - half year battle against an aggressive form of cancer			1
a tribute to his all - too - short life formed a profoundly poignant prelude to the celebrations which followed			0
@entity178 ’s image was displayed on the giant screens inside @entity2 before kick - off as the ground reverberated to a heartfelt rendition of ‘ @entity183 ’			1
on the field , the game developed at a decidedly end - of - season pace			2
@entity33 carried the greater threat and their first real opportunity arrived when @entity189 escaped down the left flank and tried to catch out @entity191 at a tight angle			2
the @entity194 goalkeeper was , however , wise to his intentions and turned the ball behind for a corner			0
@entity26 sought to maximise their counter-attacks and might well have snatched the lead after 20 minutes			2
@entity200 advanced into central space in front of the home penalty area , all the time glancing to his right to see @entity206 charge forward in support			0
@entity200 ’s pass was perfectly weighted but , rather than strike first - time , @entity209 took a touch that enabled @entity211 to block out any real danger			0
happy man : @entity4 holds the @entity16 trophy for the cameras on a day of celebration all smiles : @entity33 goalkeeper @entity218 ( left ) and striker @entity40 meeting the fans : striker @entity61 celebrates along with the @entity33 supporters at full - time old buddies : @entity26 manager @entity149 ( left ) with former @entity33 team - mate @entity35 delivery : @entity33 legends @entity94 ( left ) and @entity35 carry the @entity16 trophy into the stadium @entity189 and @entity227 continue to lurk with menace for the remainder of the opening period but could n’t produce anything that caused @entity191 excessive concern			1
shots from awkward positions and distance were often the end product			0
things were even quieter for @entity218 , but @entity26 finally drew him into action five minutes after the restart			2
@entity240 , back on his old stomping ground , worked a short corner routine with @entity209 before sending @entity243 the wrong way with a nimble dummy			0
that opened the way for a low shot that @entity218 pushed out , with the goalkeeper then relieved to see @entity250 spoon the rebound too high			0
@entity189 had the ball in the other net seconds later , only for an offside flag to truncate his celebrations			0
it was his final act before being replaced by @entity40 with 30 minutes remaining			1
all of a sudden , @entity33 seemed to find greater potency			2
@entity123 burst clear of a trio of @entity58 players nipping at his ankles before picking out commons			0
he surged forward to angle in a drive that @entity191 denied at his near post			0
then , on 64 minutes , the breakthrough arrived as @entity33 made it into treble figures for @entity16 goals			2
commons whipped in a deep delivery from the right that found the @entity26 centre - backs wanting			1
it was too high for @entity274 but @entity61 was right behind him to head into the far corner of the net			2
acknowledgment : @entity4 applauds the fans during a lap of honour around @entity2 a message from above : a plane flies over @entity2 displaying the message ' @entity33			1
champions ! ' tribute : a message is displayed on the big screen at @entity2 to remember the @entity287 the visitors tried to stage a swift response			2
@entity147 , on for @entity209 , was fluid as he moved in from the left , but his low attempt from the fringe of the area was expertly tipped wide by @entity218			0
instead , @entity149 ’s men found themselves two down with 14 minutes to go as @entity40 offered up a little souvenir of his @entity33 career			1
a poor touch from @entity298 allowed @entity227 to gather and thread a pass in the direction of the @entity84			0
he did superbly to win a sliding challenge with @entity304 before being toppled as he tried to round @entity191			0
@entity40 took the penalty himself – amid chanting of his name - and calmly planted it in the net			1
@entity26 briefly threatened a comeback when a cutback from @entity146 was deflected past @entity218 by the unfortunate @entity90			2
@entity33 , though , restored their two - goal advantage with nine minutes remaining			1
a slip by @entity312 left commons clean through and his casual dink beyond @entity191 was confirmation of a player at the peak of his powers .			0

@entity33 beat @entity26 3 - 1 on final day of season
