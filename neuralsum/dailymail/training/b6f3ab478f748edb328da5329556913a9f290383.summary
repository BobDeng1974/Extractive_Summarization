@entity0 is facing more scrutiny after a dolphin at one of its parks bit a nine - year - old girl earlier this month			1
the beleaguered park ’s @entity7 @entity6 has come under fire from @entity10 after a dolphin bit the young girl during a february 22nd visit with her family			1
@entity10 has asked @entity16 authorities to investigate the park because it allows visitors to touch the sea mammals , which it calls an ‘ animal welfare violation , ’ according to a complaint obtained by @entity22			1
@entity23 : the dolphin latched on to the nine - year - old girl 's hand strongly enough to require park staff to force it to release her a picture released by the animal rights group shows the dolphin chomping down on the girl ’s hand as she reaches out to pet it			1
a @entity10 spokesperson claimed to @entity22 that the dolphin bit the hand so tightly that park staff had to force it to let go			2
‘ this incident and exhibit clearly endangered both the dolphin and the public , ’ a @entity10 lawyer claims before citing @entity16 laws that require ‘ sufficient distance and / or barriers between animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public			1
’ another @entity10 lawyer argued in the complaint that the park ’s entire concept is flawed			2
‘ it ’s stressful enough for far - ranging dolphins to be locked up in @entity0 ’s tiny tanks , but forcing them to interact with visitors is downright dangerous			0
‘ @entity0 ’s ‘ @entity6 ’ is another example of how the park ’s main priority is profit , not the welfare of the animals or the safety of its guests , ’ he continued			0
flawed : @entity10 says allowing humans to go so closely to humans , and even be touched by them , is in violation of the animal welfare act @entity0 has more than 100 incidents of animal aggression at is multiple parks on record , the @entity10 spokesperson claimed to @entity22			1
the unidentified girl sustained bite marks and swelling to her hand , @entity10 told @entity22			2
@entity0 claims it is looking into the incident and cooperating with @entity84 investigators			0
@entity85 was not immediately able to reach the @entity84 for comment			0
this is just the latest bad pr for @entity0 since the @entity89 documentary came out and a trainer was killed in 2010 by @entity91 , a 1,300 - pound killer whale at the @entity94 park			0
the trainer was the third person to die as a result of aggression by the animal , according to reports .			0

the nine - year - old girl was bitten during a february 22 visit
she suffered only minor *injuries* , but @entity10 wants the incident investigated as proof of violations of the ' animal welfare act '
