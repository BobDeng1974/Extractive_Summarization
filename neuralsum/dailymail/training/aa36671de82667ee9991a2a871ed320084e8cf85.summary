by @entity0 published : 15:34 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 08:56 est , 15 january 2014 the father of a regular @entity3 : special victim 's unit star has been charged in a sex abuse scandal that sounds like a plotline from the show			1
@entity9 , an actor from @entity12 soap opera @entity10 , is charged with forcing young girls to perform sex acts on him in the bathroom of a television studio headquarters			1
the 81 - year - old actor is the father of @entity18 , whose @entity20 acting credits include frequent appearances on @entity3 : svu and the role of @entity24 in @entity25			1
end of day one : @entity18 ( left ) and his sister @entity26 ( right ) are at their father @entity27 's side ( center ) as they leave a @entity32 court on tuesday after the first day of the trial where he is accused of raping a child and five other sex offences the elder @entity18 now faces two counts of rape involving a 15 - year - old girl in 1967 as well as five indecent assaults involving four girls aged between 11 and 16 , between 1965 and 1968			1
prosecutors claim he targeted ' star struck teenagers ' , including autograph hunters , before attacking them at the @entity46 studios where @entity10 was filmed , in his @entity47 and at a house in @entity49			1
when charged with rape , @entity18 - who plays @entity52 in the @entity55 show - issued a statement in which he said he was ' astounded and deeply horrified ' by the accusations			1
he said : ' i strenuously deny the allegations and will now focus my full attention on fighting to preserve my innocence in the challenging times ahead			0
like a plotline : the graphic sex acts described in his father 's trial sound like something that could have been a storyline for an episode of @entity3 : @entity68 , where @entity18 ( left ) was a regular guest star changing : @entity18 began appearing on @entity3 in 2008 , and looked different today ( at right ) as he walked out of the court with his father ' i would like to offer my sincere thanks to all those people who have offered me their support and good wishes at this difficult time			1
' @entity18 later formally pleaded not guilty to the seven counts he faces			1
two other famed entertainment figures are also on trial today for sexually assaulting young girls , but both @entity81 and @entity82 have entered not guilty pleas			2
@entity81 , a veteran television presenter , is accused of carrying out the historic sex attacks over an 18 - year period between 1968 and 1986			1
he also faces a further four charges of making indecent photos of a child but is yet to enter pleas			2
@entity82 , a radio dj , is on trial for allegedly attacking nearly a dozen young women over the course of three decades - including while acting in a pantomime and at the opening of a hospital radio station			1
the 68 - year - old , whose real name is @entity96 , faces 13 counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault , dating between 1976 and 2008			1
the prosecutor said while the case concerned events which happened a long time ago , that did not mean the allegations were less important			0
' if you think a victim of crime has lost the opportunity to complain because he or she did not complain at or near the time , please think again , ' attorney @entity106 said in opening statements on tuesday			0
' a crime is a crime , whenever it takes place '			0
setting out the allegations made by five women , the prosecutor said the first complainant in the case contacted the police last march			0
her son had been discussing infamous sex scandals involving @entity125 , a now - deceased politician , and the late @entity128 presenter @entity127 , and how long it had taken for victims of sexual offences to come forward			1
she then told him he had been attacked by @entity18 and agreed to go to the police			1
the victim , aged 15 at the time of the alleged offences in 1967 , told police that she was at a house in @entity49 and claimed ' without any preliminaries ' was led to a double bedroom and raped			1
the prosecutor said : ' he did not attempt to kiss her or sweet - talk her in any way			2
' she describes it being uncomfortable and to feeling panic - stricken			0
she had never had sex before			0
' afterwards it was as if nothing had happened , the court heard			0
same line of work : @entity18 followed in his father 's career footsteps as his dad was has been a longtime star of @entity12 soap opera @entity10 on screen : the actor 's on screen wife , @entity159 , played by @entity160 , will give evidence during the four week trial , the court heard the second time , at the same house , @entity18 is alleged to have pushed her against a wall and raped her once more			1
' when it was over , she ran out , ' @entity166 said			0
the jury was then told about another alleged victim of @entity18 's , now aged 63 , who was just 14 in 1965 when the actor is said to have indecently assaulted her			1
that summer she visited @entity173 in central @entity46 with a friend to take part in a talent show and afterwards she saw @entity18 in the building and recognised him , miss @entity106 said			2
' she was naturally impressed			0
she and her friend ended up in a dressing room with the defendant and other actors , ' the prosecutor said			0
he then led her by the arm to the men 's toilet , where he allegedly made her commit a sex act on him			0
' there was no conversation and they went back to the dressing room where her friend was still chatting to an actor '			0
afterwards , @entity18 sent her a letter and signed photograph of himself , which will be shown to the jury			2
in the dock : @entity10 star @entity9 is accused of two counts of rape and five indecent assaults dating back almost 50 years attacks : the prosecution say the star enjoyed attacking girls ins in a risky place , ' using his position and fame to try and obtain a continuation of sexual gratification ' but this was not a ' benign personal touch ' by a ' well - known young male actor ' , the court heard			1
instead it was a deliberate act , miss @entity106 said , ' designed to impress a young schoolgirl and to secure her unquestioning loyalty as a fan for a sexual purpose			0
a sort of grooming , as we would nowadays call it '			0
as his four - week trial started today , jurors were told to remember the actor is accused of sex offences - not his much - loved character @entity52			2
mr justice @entity227 said it was important to distinguish between the ' real person ' and the part he has played on the @entity55 soap since its first episode in 1960			0
mr @entity233 said : ' you may feel in one sense you know the defendant , mr @entity18			2
he is well known as an actor who for many years has played the part of @entity52 in @entity10			2
' but of course this is not the fictional character of @entity52 in court			0
it is a real person , @entity9 , who is on trial			2
' you must separate the fictional character from the real person , you will have to decide verdicts from the evidence you will hear from a real person , about a real person '			0
the world 's longest - serving soap actor has not appeared in the programme while the legal proceedings are ongoing			2
he has been on bail since his arrest with various conditions including residence , no direct unsupervised contact with anyone under 16 and not to approach named witnesses			0
@entity18 denies two counts of rape and five counts of indecent assault			1
