it was the single most deadly day on the world 's highest peak - 16 sherpa guides were killed on @entity3 when an avalanche struck the @entity5 on april 18			1
on that morning , just before 7am , mountaineer @entity6 was lying his tent 17,598 ft up the iconic peak at @entity9 when the unnerving , but a familiar sound of ' creaking and groaning ' caused him to stick his head out and what he saw will haunt him forever			1
' within a couple of seconds it looked like this big white dragon , thunderously loud , moving at probably 200 miles an hour , straight toward our sherpa , who were carrying some of our equipment up to a higher camp			2
out of the @entity48 's who died that day , three were working for @entity6 and instead of a triumphant piece of television , the @entity40 crew found themselves witness to a dramatic rescue and recovery mission in the moments that followed			1
aired on sunday night , the revised special , @entity55 , showed harrowing footage from the scene , including the heart - breaking moment rescuers discovered the leg of @entity48 , @entity61 , poking out the huge icy fall			1
' i looked outside and saw the avalanche coming down , ' @entity6 recalled according to the @entity65			1
' everyone got wiped out that i could see			0
' @entity67 to help : cameras from the @entity40 production crew witness the frantic attempts to reach those affected by the avalanche ice blocks the size of houses : the avalanche 's power is appreciated when the helpless mountaineers are seen in comparison with the displaced ice despite not being in the deadly path , @entity6 knew then and there that his wing suit adventure would not happen			1
' we were just doing all we could do to find our guys and get their dead bodies off the mountain , ' he said			2
' we were trying to reach our guys by radio , but we could n't get anyone on the radio , ' an emotional @entity6 recalled to the @entity65			1
' within an hour we knew they were dead			0
they 'd found some pieces of equipment that had literally gotten blown off the guys			0
' at @entity9 , @entity98 and the @entity40 production crew were around a half - mile from the avalanche and they instantly tried to contact his sherpa guide team			1
when they received no response , they immediately feared the worst			0
emotional : @entity6 watched the avalanche from his tent as it began to tumble down the slopes of @entity3 on april 18 recovery : @entity6 said that it dawned on everyone very quickly that this would not be a rescue mission the powerful and emotional @entity40 special revealed the moment that one survivor was found buried waist deep , battered and bloody from ice as heavy as blocks of concrete			1
others were simply entombed in the ice			0
' it was a hanging glacier , a big piece of ice that came off the west shoulder of @entity3 , ' @entity6 said to zap2it.com			1
' it had been there for millions of years			0
' @entity6 rushed towards the disaster zone and because of his peak physical fitness was able to make the climb in only one hour - for others it would have taken much longer			2
' i knew this was going to be bad , ' he said , admitting he knew this was a recovery mission , not a rescue			2
in tears during the @entity40 special , @entity6 explained how he saw a helicopter airlift the tragic dead away from the scene wrapped in sleeping bags or tents			1
harrowing : the leg of @entity61 is visible in this tragic grab from @entity40 's @entity55 which aired on sunday evening so sad : bodies were airlifted away from the disaster zone wrapped in sleeping bags or tents ' i sat there and watched the whole thing , ' he said to @entity156			1
' they found body after body			0
' there were three sherpas working for @entity162 and @entity163 - @entity61 , @entity164 and @entity165 — but the mountaineer knew all 16			2
respecting their reputation as the world 's greatest climbers , @entity6 specially requested those three to help carry the heavy filming equipment			2
' i knew they would appreciate what i was trying to do , ' he said			0
during his two decades climbing the world 's tallest peaks , @entity6 had witnessed many avalanches , but nothing like this			1
on @entity3 , everything is bigger and when a glacier breaks , ' it buries people like concrete buries the ,			2
' ' it was a hanging glacier , a big piece of ice that came off the west shoulder of @entity3 , ' said @entity6			1
' it had been there for millions of years			0
' confirmation : the documentary from @entity40 showed how the disaster unfolded in real time and how the production team who were there for a wing suit record attempt quickly found themselves organizing a recovery mission during the course of the @entity40 special , the build up to the moment of the avalanche was replayed , including interviews with @entity6 , expedition leader @entity202 and additional members of the expedition and production teams			1
' it 's heartbreaking , ' said a still - shaken @entity6			2
' i 've been climbing in the @entity210 for the past 15 years and forged a friendship with a lot of these guys			0
i 'm shell - shocked by this			0
' the network also announced they are to donate to the @entity217 , which helps the families of the deceased			0
@entity6 is still reeling from the accident and told @entity220 that the , ' @entity222 job in the world to go rescue your dead buddies off that mountain and that ’s exactly what everybody came together to do that that day			1
highest peak on @entity229 : a group of more than a dozen sherpas had gone up on the mountain early friday morning to fix some ropes that would be used by trekkers later in the day , but one survivor recalled feeling that the route was unstable @entity5 : more than 4,000 climbers have scaled @entity3 's summit since it was first climbed by sir @entity238 and @entity239 in 1953			1
the route they took along the @entity242 was the one hit by the avalanche star of the show : the @entity40 live jump was going to be done by @entity6 , an experienced wingsuiter , and the special was announced in february ' so it ’s a really powerful story and it needs to be told			1
i do n’t know if i ’ll ever be able to watch it			0
my heart ’s broken and i ’ll never , ever get over it			0
' however , while his attempt to jump off @entity3 in his specially designed wing suit has been postponed , he is now focusing on helping the families of the dead sherpas			1
' i think what people do n't realize is how much the @entity258 enjoy their jobs , ' he said			2
' they are far from slaves			0
' ' my goal went from climbing and jumping off the mountain to raising money for the families , ' @entity6 said			1
he wants those willing to donate money to visit @entity270 , where 100 percent of the proceeds will go to the victims families			0
' we were at @entity274			0
@entity3 to make history , but instead we were there as eyewitnesses to history , ' said @entity278 , group president , @entity40 , @entity279 and @entity280			1
deadly force : the avalanche that killed at least thirteen sherpas is pictured as it barrels down @entity3 no hope of survival : rescuers on @entity3 found the body of a 13th @entity289 guide buried under snow as authorities ruled out hope of finding any more survivors from the deadliest accident ever on the world 's highest peak indeed , in the aftermath of the disaster , the @entity258 have refused to climb , citing poor conditions and a lack of respect from the @entity302 , who make millions each year from climbing permits			1
conversely , when a sherpa dies their family receives $ 400			0
' i think it 's their right to , ' said @entity6 of the @entity258 ' strike			1
' it 's very fresh in their minds ... but life goes on			0
it 's going to be pretty hard for a lot of guys to make a living if they do n't want to work , including myself			0
' i do n't want to find something else to do and i think a lot of @entity258 in that region take a lot of pride in what they do			2
' everybody , @entity328 people and @entity48 , needed to take some time to let this sink in and go away a little bit before we start planning the next season on @entity3			2
' @entity289 mountain rescue workers lifting an injured climber after an avalanche came down on @entity274			2
authorities called off the rescue operation for survivors after 13 @entity289 climbing guides were killed in an avalanche on @entity3 , as bad weather closed in final resting place : group of family members of the @entity289 mountaineer carry the body of @entity347 , who died on @entity274			1

the 13th day after death is the customary end of mourning and the day when @entity369 generally hold memorials			0
' we are still disappointed at the government , which has done little for the family members			0
the help they have given is a joke , like giving money to a beggar			0
the state should take care of the families of the dead , ' said @entity383 , who lost her brother in the avalanche			0
while 13 bodies have been recovered , the three others are buried under heavy snow and ice			0
most of the expedition teams have left the mountain while the rest are packing their bags and gear in the base camp			0
the avalanche was the deadliest disaster on the world 's highest mountain			2
it was triggered when a massive piece of glacier sheared away from the mountain along a treacherous section of constantly shifting ice and crevasses known as the @entity5 , marked by overhanging ice as big as office buildings .			0

on april 18 , @entity3 witnessed its single most deadly day when 16 @entity258 died in a huge avalanche
experienced @entity414 mountaineer @entity6 was there with a production crew from the @entity40
he was to film the first ascent of the mountain and leap off the summit using a wing suit
the film crew instead documented the tragic search and recovery as @entity258 frantically tried to dig out their friends and relatives
aired as a discovery special @entity55 on sunday night
served as a *tribute* to the brave sherpa mountaineers
