by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 02:56 est , 5 november 2012 @entity1 will launch a campaign today to compel the government to deal only with firms willing to pay a ‘ living ’ wage			1
he will insist @entity7 contracts should only be offered to companies paying at least £ 7.20 an hour , or £ 8.30 in @entity9 , both far above the legal minimum wage			1
the @entity12 leader will mark @entity13 by saying it is an idea ‘ whose time has come ’			0
' key plank ' : labour leader @entity1 , left , who has worked closely with his brother @entity17 , right , on the plans , has said making the living wage the norm for workers is at the heart of his party 's bid to return to power but @entity3 lawyers warn awarding contracts on the basis of hourly wage rates may be illegal			1
the legal opinion was based on a @entity32 case which found that describing a wage in a particular contract could be illegal unless it was universally applied across the country			0
the opposition leader has been working closely with his brother @entity38 on ways to ensure the pay terms replace the lower minimum wage as the norm - possibly through naming and shaming companies that do not pay it			1
their collaboration is a sign that tensions between the @entity49 are thawing after @entity1 narrowly beat his brother to the @entity12 leadership in 2010			0
' slog ' : @entity1 has said workers deserve a decent wage if their employers can afford it the leader of the opposition said the wage - defined as the minimum hourly rate needed for an acceptable standard of living - was a key plank of his ' @entity62 ' vision to share prosperity			1
the £ 7.20 living wage , which rises to more than £ 8.30 in @entity9 , is higher than the current minimum wage of £ 6.19 for people aged 21 and over , and £ 4.98 for those aged 18 to 20			1
while some large firms and public sector employers already pay the living wage to staff , @entity12 wants to see more companies adopting the policy voluntarily			1
as part of its policy review , @entity12 is looking at three ways of making the pay terms the new norm , including naming and shaming listed companies who do not pay the wage through corporate governance rules			1
it is also considering introducing rules that will see @entity7 contracts awarded to firms who pay workers the living wage or above , and giving @entity90 - funded incentives to companies who introduce the wage structure			2
in an interview with the @entity95 , @entity1 said : ' you go out , slog your guts out ... you deserve a decent wage if the company can afford it			0
' we 've got a growth crisis in @entity102 but we 've also got a living standards crisis , because the proceeds of economic growth are not being fairly distributed any more			0
' it is about giving people a proper stake in the future of the country , ' he said			0
in an article for the @entity114 newspaper , his brother @entity17 , the former foreign secretary , said local authorities and other employers could be offered financial incentives for insisting that private contractors pay the living wage as a condition of being awarded work			2
the @entity123 estimates that for every person moved on to the living wage , the @entity90 would save around £ 1,000 from less spending on tax credits and from increased tax revenue			2
' tension ' : @entity1 , left , narrowly beat his brother @entity38 , right , to the @entity12 leadership in 2010 a number of major firms already pay workers and contractors a living wage or higher			1
@entity137 has paid the living wage in @entity9 since 2007 , while 19 local authorities have been accredited as ' living wage employers '			2
@entity1 said the wage was good for businesses because staff turnover was lower			0
the idea of naming companies who do not offer the wage and paying money back to employers through @entity90 savings was set out last week in a report on living standards by the @entity153			0
@entity154 , the think tank 's chief executive , said : ' one in five @entity102 workers are low paid and it 's a major reason why so many lower - income families feel as if they 're running uphill - working hard but getting almost nowhere			2
' the high price of low pay is also borne by the taxpayer through in - work subsidies - so we all have reason to do something about it			0
' requiring listed companies to report how many of their employees receive less than the living wage would introduce the power of transparency to this debate ; it would be a vital step and help galvanise change			0

@entity1 brothers want to see ' living wage ' replace the lower minimum wage as the new norm
defined as minimum rate required to allow workers to provide themselves and their families with the ' basis of a decent life '
plans to deliver wage of at least £ 7.20 per hour - rising to £ 8.30 in @entity9 - to millions of workers at centre of @entity12 's bid to return to power
ideas under consideration as part of @entity12 's policy review include naming and shaming firms who do not pay the living wage
