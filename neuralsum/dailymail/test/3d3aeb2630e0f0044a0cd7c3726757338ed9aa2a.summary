jurors hearing the @entity3 trial are barred from attending this year 's race , a federal judge told the panel on tuesday as part of instructions ahead of the trial 's sentencing phase			1
@entity10 , 21 , was convicted last week of planting two homemade bombs at the crowded finish line of the world famous marathon in 2013 , killing three people and injuring 264 others			1
the same jury that convicted @entity10 will hear testimony on whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison for his crimes , starting next tuesday , the day after the 2015 marathon takes place			1
' the famed race , which draws elite runners from around the world , takes place on the @entity52 holiday in @entity35 - commemorating the first battles of the @entity54 - and has taken on special significance for the city 's residents since the 2013 bomb attack			2
it will take place this monday , april 20			2
@entity26 said the sentencing phase of the trial - in which witnesses will again be called to the stand - is expected to take four weeks , followed by jury deliberations			1
' in the next phase of this case you will learn a lot more , ' defense lawyer @entity66 told jurors during closing statements in @entity10 's trial			1
@entity26 also reminded jurors to avoid all media coverage , especially on the second anniversary of the bombings on wednesday			2
the prosecution is expected to portray the ethnic @entity79 as an @entity81 extremist adherent of @entity82 who planted one of the two homemade pressure cooker bombs at the race 's finish line on april 15 , 2013 , because he ' wanted to punish @entity88 for what it was doing to his people , ' in the words of assistant u.s. attorney @entity93			1
the defense , meanwhile , is expected to play up the role of his 26 - year - old brother , @entity96 , in carrying out the attack			0
in closing arguments last week , defense attorney @entity99 contended that @entity96 was the driving force behind the bombing , with @entity10 following along			0
@entity96 died during the brothers ' chaotic final day of freedom			0
three days after the bombing , the pair shot dead a police officer and carjacked a @entity109 businessman as they attempted to flee the city			0
the carjacking victim escaped and alerted police to their plans , setting the stage for a gunfight between the @entity117 and law enforcement that ended when @entity10 roared off in the stolen suv , running over his brother			0
in this april 21 , 2014 file photo , a @entity123 k - 9 officer and his dog patrol with a @entity125 , rear right , along @entity127 near the finish line of the 118th @entity40 in this april 21 , 2014 file photo , a @entity45 police officer stands near the finish line as runners approach during the 118th @entity40 in @entity45 during the guilt phase of the trial , @entity88 district judge @entity26 had limited the amount of evidence the defense could present about the relationship between the brothers , who had immigrated to the @entity88 from @entity139 a decade before the attack			1
but the sentencing phase , which the @entity142 announced on friday would begin on april 21 , will provide the defense with an opportunity to focus on that element of the case and possibly to call @entity10 to testify			1
the death penalty is controversial in @entity35 , where it is illegal under state law but allowed in federal cases			2
the state has not seen an execution since 1947			0
the bombing killed restaurant manager @entity154 , 29 ; @entity109 exchange student @entity155 , 23 ; and 8 - year - old @entity156			0
