agonising wait : @entity1 , 32 , who is 26 weeks pregnant , wo n't know if the abortion drug has affected her baby until she is born it was the heart - stopping moment that every mother - to - be dreads			1
a routine scan to determine @entity1 ’s due date revealed her longed - for second child was dead in her womb			1
numb and bewildered , she was told she could miscarry naturally or have an abortion			1
she and husband @entity14 were distraught			1
‘ i ’d gone along expecting to see a baby on the scan , ’ she recalls			1
‘ i had n’t been expecting bad news			0
so i was stunned to be told there was no heartbeat			2
i just burst into tears			0
’ reluctantly , the couple agreed to an induced abortion and @entity1 took medication to start the process			1
two days later , after a bout of heavy bleeding , @entity1 returned to @entity27 to complete the abortion			1
there – much to her astonishment and delight – a further scan , carried out before a second drug was administered , detected a heartbeat			2
the girl they had hoped would complete their family had not died as the hospital had said			2
and against all the odds , she had survived the ill - advised abortion			2
though thrilled , the couple now face an agonising wait until their daughter is born , fearing she will have long - term health problems as a result of the medication that was intended to induce the abortion			1
to make matters worse , doctors have told them that the heavy bleeding @entity1 suffered could have been a miscarriage of a possible twin – killed by the procedure			1
as @entity1 and @entity14 struggle to understand how it could have happened , and what it could mean for them , the @entity57 hospital has launched an urgent investigation			1
doctors have warned them they can not be sure their little girl will not suffer birth defects because the abortion pill was administered during the critical 12 - week development period for the foetus			2
the couple have decided to speak of their experience in the hope that hospitals will ensure they perform a second scan with a different sonographer if it is suspected a baby has died in the womb			1
‘ to say this has ruined my pregnancy would be an understatement , ’ says laboratory manager @entity1 , 32 , who is now 26 weeks pregnant and already has a son @entity76 , two			1
‘ our little girl is a much - wanted baby and we are extremely worried she wo n’t now be born healthy			2
we are incredibly angry and upset			0
we ca n’t understand how doctors could have made such a big error			0
‘ in hindsight we believe a scan should have been carried out before i took the pill to double - check the diagnosis that the baby had died			1
’ yesterday , holding hands with her plasterer husband @entity14 , also 32 , at their home in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity1 told how they had desperately wanted a second child			1
‘ we wanted a little brother or sister for @entity76 and as i ’d had a completely normal pregnancy with him , we had no reason to believe this one would be any different , ’ she says			0
as her periods had been irregular and @entity1 was unsure how many weeks pregnant she was , her midwife suggested she had a routine ‘ dating ’ ultrasound scan and referred her to @entity27			1
however , within minutes of doing the scan the sonographer told @entity1 there was a problem			1
during a routine scan , medics told @entity1 her child had died in the womb and that she should start an induced abortion , but the baby survived the process			1
pictured : a scan of her unborn daughter ‘ she could n’t detect any heartbeat and in fact said she believed the pregnancy had already started to disintegrate , ’ recalls @entity1			1
‘ i was told i had three options			2
i could let a miscarriage occur naturally , which could take weeks , i could have a dilatation and curettage – an operation under a general anaesthetic to empty my uterus – or i could take a pill to induce labour			2
‘ i chose the pill because it meant that i could stay at home and would n’t have to leave @entity76			0
’ doctors explained she would take the first pill , containing the drug mifepristone , by mouth			2
it works by blocking the hormone progesterone			0
without this , the lining of the uterus breaks down			0
then two days later she would return to the hospital for the final stage , which would involve a second drug , misoprostol , to bring on contractions and expel what remained of the pregnancy			1
the evening after taking the mifepristone , she began to experience heavy bleeding , but thought it was part of the process			1
to check the mifepristone had worked , @entity1 underwent another scan , before taking the misoprostol			1
she recalls : ‘ as she did the scan the woman looked concerned			0
she left and returned with a colleague			0
after pointing out something on the screen , the colleague nodded and left			0
‘ the woman then turned to me and said she ’d found a heartbeat and estimated i was around seven weeks pregnant			0
i was amazed and overjoyed			0
but seconds later i was overcome with shock because i began to worry about how the drug might have harmed my baby			2
’ shaking , @entity1 rang @entity14 who hurried to the hospital			1
‘ by the time he arrived i was in a terrible state , ’ she says			0
‘ a consultant came in and said it was our decision , but due to the possible harm our baby may have suffered from the pill , it was still an option to continue with the abortion			1
however , there was no way , having seen my baby ’s heart beating on a scan , i could carry on			2
’ doctors explained that , as the drug acts by shearing off the embryo from the uterus , they could not guarantee a miscarriage would n’t happen in the coming days or weeks			1
‘ because i had such a large bleed , i ’ve since found out it might be i was pregnant with twins and did in fact miscarry one , ’ @entity1 reveals			2
‘ that was very upsetting			0
nobody knows for sure but it is heartbreaking to think i might have lost a baby over this			0
and i have been terrified since that i will lose my baby i am carrying now			0
’ a spokesman for @entity27 ( pictured ) apologised for the error and launched a probe into the incident since then , @entity1 has imagined every little twinge is a miscarriage			1
‘ it is a miracle i am still pregnant , but i just have n’t been able to relax , ’ she says			0
‘ i just wish i had asked for another scan to check , especially as i ’d had no other sign anything was amiss with the pregnancy , but then i trusted the doctors			0
they ’ve given me leaflets which explain the drug can be linked to birth defects			0
some of these might not be immediately noticeable and will only show as our daughter grows			0
but there ’s been hardly any research			0
i ’ve been reassured she is growing as expected and i feel happier now i can feel her kicking			0
but doctors ca n’t check for everything			0
‘ i am trying to put what happened to the back of my mind and be positive but then i have moments of despair at night when i fear the worst			0
‘ we have found ourselves in a nightmare situation which could have been avoided			0
we only hope getting this out into the open will ensure no one suffers as we have			0
’ @entity227 , executive director at @entity27 , said : ‘ we again apologise unreservedly to mrs @entity1 for the error and the distress this has undoubtedly caused			1
‘ we immediately launched an investigation to understand how the incident happened and how we could prevent it occurring again			2
this has now concluded and a member of our senior nursing team has arranged to meet with mrs @entity1 in person to share those findings			2

@entity1 was told after routine scan that baby had died in womb
the 32 - year - old and her husband @entity14 agreed to an induced abortion
@entity1 started taking mifepristone drug and suffered heavy bleeding
but , returning to hospital two days later , scan showed the child was alive
