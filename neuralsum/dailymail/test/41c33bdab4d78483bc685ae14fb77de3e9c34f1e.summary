celebrities and dietitians have been promoting back - to - basic diets and warning us off processed foods for years - and the trend is now taking hold in the pet world			1
three - and - a - half - year - old black labrador @entity8 swapped sweet treats and processed dog food for a diet of free range raw meat , offal and bones in his quest to lose weight			1
his owners , @entity22 and @entity23 from @entity24 , say he 's now ' a different dog ' after losing a stone and a half in eight weeks through the doggy diet - the weight of four chihuahuas			1
but he 's a much more lean machine , right , after starting his new weight loss programme the plan was devised by @entity42 , who runs a natural dog food company and realised that none of her 5,000 customers ' dogs have weight problems			1
she worked out @entity8 's weight and calculated special portions of carefully chosen lean meats in order for him to shed the pounds			1
she said : ' dogs are carnivores - they have evolved to eat prey , such as mice , rabbits and deer			2
' their digestive system , which is very different to the human digestive system , is more than able to handle raw meat , offal and bones			1
loving life : @entity22 and @entity23 say @entity8 is ' a different dog ' since losing a stone and a half on a new doggy diet of raw food			1
they believe his weight problems stem from rewards during training ' in fact , they thrive on it and you need have no concerns over its suitability			2
' we avoided beef and lamb and suggested lean raw meat like free range chicken , wild rabbit and turkey			1
' our treats are pure air - dried liver and dogs do n't need very much to feel like they 've had a treat			1
' we also introduced a concept called bone sunday			0
we gave @entity8 a beef knuckle bone to chew on all day and he did n't need anything else to eat			1
' because the bone marrow is so rich it 's enough quantity wise			0
and the action of chewing is great exercise and a rewarding game			0
' it makes sure he does n't feel like he is on a diet and that food is still fun			2
' @entity8 's owners believe his life - long weight problem stemmed from them giving him sweet treats to reward good behaviour at puppy training school			1
the treats continued into his adult life and he even learnt where they were kept and was spotted raiding the biscuit tin in the kitchen			2
his weight problem worsened as he started suffering from a joint problem called hip dysplasia affecting @entity127 - and when he took a tumble while out on a walk he was left unable to move			2
@entity130 , 55 , a car tyre production assistant said : ' we were encouraged to use biscuits as rewards but he was so good at everything we taught him we just had to carry on giving him treats			2
' his weight just went on and on and on			0
' but it got a lot worse when he slipped over one day when we were out for a walk in the woods			0
' he injured his leg and could n't walk very far so it made it really difficult to take him out for exercise			0
' and because he has hip dysplasia it meant his recovery took a long time			2
' he became sluggish and tired all the time and he just carried on piling on the pounds			0
' i think it did n't help that he knew his way round the kitchen and exactly where we kept the dog biscuits			2
' i knew his weight was becoming a problem but it was n't until we got to the vet that we realised how big he had got			0
' once i took him to the vet and we realised how bad the problem with his weight was we knew we had to take action straight away			0
' standing tall : @entity8 struggled with a hip condition common in labradors and poor mobility worsened his weight problems			1
but losing weight has made him much more mobile after spotting an advert for the trial of a new diet for dogs on facebook , @entity22 signed @entity8 up for the new regime - the @entity178			1
it meant - just like a human trying to fight the flab - swapping his usual processed food and sweet treats for low fat meats			1
after eight weeks he had lost eight kilos , going from 55kg - the weight of a small great dane - to 47			0
a much slimmer @entity8 comes back to the beach after a swim in the sea during a walk on the beach shake it off : @entity8 is able to enjoy a dog 's life after shedding so much weight with his doggy diet of lean meat @entity22 added : ' we changed his diet straight away and went from tins and packets to all raw food			1
' and because all of the food was delivered and it was a complete change it was really straightforward			0
' now he runs around and has bounds more energy			0
' he loves a ball and is absolutely mad about going for a swim			0
we ca n't even run a bath without him trying to jump into the bathroom			0
' he 's like a completely different dog			0
' a different dog : ' now he runs around and has bounds more energy ' , said owner @entity22 who took him to the vets as soon as she realised how serious his weight problem was			0

@entity8 from @entity24 suffers from hip problems - and a sweet tooth
swapped sweet treats and processed food for raw meat , offal and bones
owners say he is a ' different dog ' since going on raw foods doggy diet
