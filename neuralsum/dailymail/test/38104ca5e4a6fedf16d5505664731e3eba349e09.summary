@entity0 have been bolstered by the news that @entity2 has declared himself fit ahead of sunday 's derby against @entity4			1
@entity5 has missed @entity0 's last six games following an ankle injury he suffered in their 2 - 1 defeat at @entity9 on february 21			1
in his absence the @entity10 have won all five of their subsequent @entity14 matches , with their only blip coming in a @entity17 sixth round exit at home to @entity19 last month			0
@entity2 has declared himself fit for the @entity21 derby after missing @entity0 's last six games the 31 - year - old arrived for @entity0 training on friday ahead of sunday 's home clash at @entity26 prior to his injury , @entity5 ( left ) was a regular in @entity0 boss @entity29 's starting line - up in his absence though @entity0 have won their last five league matches , climbing up to third in the table with the return of the 31 - year - old it poses the question of where he will fit in @entity29 's now settled 4 - 3 - 3 formation and how does he fare against fellow forwards @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
based on his goalscoring stats in the @entity14 this season , @entity5 has provided an attacking threat once more for the @entity26 outfit			0
the @entity47 international has scored 10 goals in 24 appearances and 1,993 minutes of top flight football so far			1
only @entity40 has fared better - netting 12 times in 27 games and 2,383 minutes of action			2
in comparison @entity41 's stats make for a poor reading of four goals in 20 games and 1,032 minutes with young forward @entity42 's strike against @entity60 in january his only one to date this season in 12 matches and 331 minutes of football			1
@entity5 ( third left ) has scored 10 goals in 24 league appearances and 1,993 minutes so far this season @entity40 ( centre ) scored a stunning half - volley as @entity0 beat @entity68 3 - 1 on march 4 that strike ( left ) moved the @entity0 captain to two goals clear of @entity5 in addition @entity5 's overall attacking contribution wo n't have been overlooked by @entity74 - a man who pays attention to the smallest of details			1
@entity5 's stats are also favourable in comparison to his fellow strikers in terms of creating chances for others			0
while he sits sits behind @entity40 and @entity41 ( both four ) in terms of assists with two , @entity0 's @entity83 has provided the second most amount of chances among @entity74 's forwards with 24			1
only @entity40 has more with 40 , while @entity41 has 14 and @entity42 providing just the one opportunity			0
despite his favourable personal stats though , as a team @entity0 have performed better without @entity5			0
in his 24 matches played this season , the @entity10 have only won 50 per cent of those - with eight draws and four defeats			2
@entity41 has scored four goals in 20 games and 1,032 minutes of action for the club this season @entity42 ( right ) only goal for the @entity10 this campaign came in a 2 - 0 win at @entity60 in january furthermore @entity0 have only averaged 1.8 points per game with the side scoring 1.7 goals per match and conceding one			1
in contrast , @entity74 's side have been triumphant in six of their seven matches without @entity5 with an improved win percentage at 85.70			0
in his absence to @entity0 have averaged 2.6 points per game , scoring two goals and conceding 0.6 per match			2
@entity74 has been reluctant to change the starting xi that has fashioned wins against @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity68 in their last three matches - meaning club record signing @entity123 has been forced to sit on the bench			0
on current form , the phrase ' if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it , ' is an applicable one to the @entity10 ' starting @entity118 as they look to cement a top four finish			0
for @entity5 , that looks likes playing second fiddle to @entity40 as the club 's lone striker for now			2
@entity123 ( left ) has had to be content with a place on the @entity0 bench in recent matches			0

@entity0 face rivals @entity4 in the league on sunday
@entity2 has missed @entity0 's last six games through injury
31 - year - old striker has scored 10 goals in 24 league games this season
