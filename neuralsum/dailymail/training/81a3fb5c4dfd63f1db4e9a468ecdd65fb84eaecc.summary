you may think hair extensions were created for the feisty , fake - tan bearing women of today â€“ but they were in fact being flaunted by @entity6 women more than 3,000 years ago			1
the pieces were elaborate creations , with one recently uncovered in an @entity6 coffin made up of 70 elaborate extensions fastened together			1
the owner of the hair piece had her body wrapped in a mat , but her name , age and occupation remain a mystery to archaeologists			2
scrll down for video the owner of the hair piece had her body wrapped in a mat , but her name , age and occupation remain a mystery to archaeologists the skull was one of hundreds found in the ancient city of @entity33 , many of which had their final hairstyles incredibly well - preserved using fat			1
one skull had extensions made of grey and dark black hair suggesting a number of different people donated their hair to create the piece			1
however , the latest intricate design of hair extension has left researchers on the @entity48 baffled			0
' whether or not the woman had her hair styled like this for her burial only is one of our main research questions , ' @entity49 , an archaeologist working on the @entity48 , told @entity57 at live science ' whether or not the woman had her hair styled like this for her burial only is one of our main research questions , ' @entity49 ( pictured ) , an archaeologist working on the @entity48 , told live science this skull was one of hundreds found in the ancient city of @entity33 , many of which had their final hairstyles incredibly well - preserved using fat ancient @entity6 used hair gel to style their locks in everyday life , researchers have found			1
a study several years ago of male and female mummies has found fashion - conscious @entity6 made use of a fat - based product to keep their hair in place			1
they used the styling gel on both long and short hair , tried to curl their hair with tongs and even plaited it in hair extensions to lengthen their tresses			2
it is thought they used these methods in both life and death , with corpses being styled to make sure they looked good in the afterlife			0
the incredible discovery was made by archaeological scientists who studied hair samples of 18 male and female mummies , aged from four to 58 years old			2
using light and electron microscopes , they found that nine of the mummies had coated their hair in the fatty substance , which is thought to be a beauty product			0
bizarrely , even in the artificially - preserved bodies the hair did not contain resins or embalming materials , suggesting the hair was styled separately to the mummification process			1
' the hair was most likely styled after death , before a person was buried			0
' it is also likely , however , that these hairstyles were used in everyday life as well and that the people in @entity33 used hair extensions in their daily life			1
' out of 100 skulls analysed , 28 still had hair			0
the type of hair ranged from curly black to light brown and curly , suggesting some ethnic diversity in the region			0
skulls with in tact hair often had curls around their ears , and many also had braids			2
one skull had extensions made of grey and dark black hair suggesting a number of different people donated their hair to create the piece ' all braids found in the coiffures were simple and of three strands , mostly 0.4 inches wide , with strands of approximately 0.2 inches ( 5mm ) when tightly braided , ' ms @entity49 writes in the journal article			1
people at @entity33 also liked to keep their hair short			2
' braids were often not more than 7.9 inches ( 20cm ) long , leaving the hair at shoulder length approximately , ' ms @entity49 added			0
and it appears ancient @entity6 women used a similar technique to hide their greys			0
some of the skulls shows evidence of a dye , possibly henna , used on hair			0

pictured is the @entity6 lady with 70 hair extensions the skulls were found in @entity33 , which was constructed as a new capital of @entity6 by the pharaoh @entity173 you may think hair extensions were created for modern women , such as @entity177 from @entity178 is @entity179 ( pictured ) , but they were in fact being flaunted by @entity6 women more than 3,000 years ago			1

the skull was one of hundreds found in the ancient city of @entity33
many had their final hairstyles incredibly well - preserved using fat
one skull had elaborate extensions made of grey and black hair
