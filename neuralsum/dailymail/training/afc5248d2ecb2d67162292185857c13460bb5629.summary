by @entity0 a man who first rose to fame after performing at the @entity3 with @entity4 has now made his way into the record books - after walking the world 's highest ever slackline			1
a piece of fabric suspended midair between two hot air balloons in the @entity14 desert , 4,000 feet above the ground , was the scene where @entity17 , 27 , from @entity18 , set the record - in less than 20 seconds			1
the record was for the highest line ever walked above ground level			1
the previous record was 3,000 feet - a number easily beaten by mr @entity17			1
at an astounding 4,000 feet above ground , mr @entity17 walked the rope held by two hot air balloons in the middle of the @entity14 desert mr @entity17 smashed the previous record - which was 3,000 feet , by 1,000 feet			1
he completed the challenge near @entity33 last month the daredevil , from @entity18 is known as ' @entity17 ' because he will brave any challenge which comes his way the fabric measured just 39 feet in length and was set up in the desert near @entity33			1
and mr @entity17 did not even use a leash for the crossing , his safety net was a parachute attached to his body			1
to prepare himself for the moment , mr @entity17 and his team did trial runs at the somewhat lower height of 6 - 10 feet and then 600 - 700 feet before untying the balloons and pulling them to the extraordinary height of 4,000 feet			1
while he walked , his friend @entity52 dangled upside down in mid-air and admired the scene			0
mrs @entity52 , who provided the balloons and helped design the project , is the inspiration behind the record			2
mrs @entity52 is pictured below dangling upside down and draped in colorful ribbons			0
ready for a challenge : mr @entity17 is pictured here climbing out of the hot air balloon basket before making the 20 second journey across to other crew members - on a tiny piece of fabric flying thousands of feet above the ground it 's a long way up : @entity17 prepares to step onto the slackline and smash a world record in just 20 seconds mr @entity17 walks the 12 metre - long line while his friend @entity71 , the brains behind the project , watches dangled upside down in mid-air to balance himself on the line , mr @entity17 spread his arms out wide while he walked after completing the record , mr @entity17 balanced himself on the edge of the hot air balloon and punched the air in celebration mr @entity17 , who is known under the nickname ' @entity84 ' because of his willingness to try his hand at anything - no matter how high - completed the stunt			1
after the stunt , mr @entity17 said : ' it felt amazing to be on the line , it was very free and incredibly exposed			1
' i will have a lot of self - doubt before i walk the line but the nerves turned into excitement and the excitement turned into focus and i love walking when it 's a challenge the most			2
' it 's a great view : the slackliner holds himself upside down and admires the view from the line - 4,000 feet above ground level that 's what i had in store : mr @entity17 surveys the air balloons from ground level mr @entity17 grinning for the camera after completing the challenge			1
after skydiving down to ground , he is pictured right after setting a new world record just three weeks before a @entity115 team , known has the @entity116 or ' the @entity117 ' had failed when they attempted the feat in @entity119			1
and the challenge was n't enough for the @entity18 , now based in @entity121 , who then skydived down to ground from the mid-air scene			1
he described the dive as like ' a victory dance '			0
he said : ' the skydive was a release after the tension of the high line			0
' falling is so easy compared to high lining			0
it 's like a victory dance			0
' before taking on the real challenge mr @entity17 practiced by setting up the line just metres above the ground the hot air balloons are pictured here getting ready for the world record			1
moments later they began their ascent to 4,000 feet above ground level in 2012 , mr @entity17 brought slacklining into popular culture by performing alongside @entity4 at the 2012 @entity3 half - time show			1
@entity4 was so in awe of the sportsman that she then asked him to come on tour with him			2
mr @entity17 turned the offer down because he wanted to continue traveling the world living the ' slacklife '			1
he described this as : ' about finding your passions and doing your best '			0
the video of the successful stunt was released to promote the launch of the new online adventure network the @entity161 you can find out more about this stunt at @entity163 the height of the slackline was almost a seventh of the height of @entity168 - which measures 29,000 feet			2
the @entity169 measures 1,250 feet - less than three times the height of the line			2
its height was almost four times higher than the @entity174 - with a height of 1,062 feet			2
with 163 floors and measuring 2,716 feet , the @entity176 in @entity177 is the tallest man - made structure in the world			2
but the line was set up more than 1,000 feet higher than the tip of the @entity177 building			1
from afar , this man looks as though he is stepping through thin air - in fact , thousands of miles from @entity14 , these line walkers took on a challenge of their own and set a @entity191 record for line walking in @entity193 , @entity194			1
above an equally dramatic scenery , @entity195 , 24 , @entity196 , 23 , and @entity198 circus performer @entity197 went highlining over the @entity200 in @entity193			0
at 250 feet , above a steep drop , they set the record for the highline completed at the highest altitude ever in the @entity191			2
and once they had finished , daredevil @entity196 dangled himself upside down from the piece of fabric			2
the scene was captured by @entity191 photographer @entity210 , 44 who photographed the walkers making their way across the 40 metre - long rope at the summit of the @entity215			0
@entity195 walks through the sky - 250 feet above ground level - to set the @entity191 record for the highest height walked across a rope above ground level dramatic : walkers braved heights of 250 feet in @entity193 , @entity194 as they walked across a piece of rope suspended in mid-air it took them two hours to reach the scene			1
once they had arrived , a line was erected after the climbers put slings around large blocks and boulders to keep the piece of fabric in place			0
mr @entity210 said he felt ' lucky ' to have witnessed the scene and described the day as one of the most exciting of his career			0
he said : ' it was the position of the highline that made it spectacular			0
because of its location near the summit of @entity215 it was the highest - altitude highline made to date in the @entity191 and that made it a really special event			0
' i was so lucky to see these guys in action , they made it look incredibly graceful and from a distance it looked as if they were walking in the sky			0
' mr @entity210 said that the highliners had to adjust their balance as the rope moved under their feet			0
he said : ' if the line is set - up properly the high liners should n’t be in any danger , however , there ’s a great deal of critical judgement in the complex rigging of the line			0
' the pressure placed on the anchors by simply walking across a taut high line can be incredibly large and that ’s before the shock of falling - off on to the line is taken into account			0
' it is n’t something to be considered without having somebody involved with a great deal of experience at setting - up highlines			0
' circus performer @entity197 travelled from @entity285 to set the @entity191 record the walk was not enough for highliner @entity196 who then hung himself upside down from the piece of rope photographer @entity210 said he felt ' lucky ' to have witnessed the scene in the @entity200 ( pictured ) and described the day as one of the most exciting of his career			0
he said : ' it was the position of the highline that made it spectacular '			0

@entity17 , from @entity18 , walked 1,000 feet higher than the previous world record
it took him 20 seconds but the challenge was not enough for the 27 - year - old who then skydived to ground
the 40 feet piece of fabric was suspended between two hot air balloons
mr @entity17 was previously asked to show off his *skills* on with @entity4
