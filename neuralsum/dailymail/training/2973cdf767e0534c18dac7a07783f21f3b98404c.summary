authorities in @entity1 are poised to greenlight a plan to turn the former pub where @entity5 leader @entity4 was born into a ' @entity7 ' museum to his crimes			1
the former pub @entity10 , on @entity12 street , in @entity13 , has been empty for three years			1
on friday a meeting was held in the town to discuss the private venture to strip it of its allure for the far - right			1
over the years since the end of the war the building , where @entity4 was born on april 20 , 1889 , has served as a bank , workshop , library , school and as a home for the disabled			1
authorities in @entity1 are poised to greenlight a plan to turn the house where @entity5 leader @entity4 was born into a ' @entity7 ' museum to his crimes a stone stands outside the house in which @entity4 was born , with the inscription ' for peace , freedom and democracy , never again fascism , millions of dead are a warning ' since 2011 @entity13 has paid the owners , who have had the property since 1912 , £ 3,250 - a - month to keep it empty as plans were discussed about what to do with it			1
@entity43 from across @entity44 continue to flock to it , paying homage to their evil messiah who moved out of the premises with father @entity51 and mother @entity52 shortly after birth			1
now the @entity1 interior ministry in @entity55 has got behind the project of historian @entity57 to renovate the former pub into a ' @entity7			1
' @entity59 winning @entity61 - born producer @entity60 is a heavyweight name backing the @entity57 scheme and has pledged big money from movie industry players in @entity66 for the museum plan			2
other mooted projects , such as demolition or turning it into luxury flats , failed to gain traction			2
@entity73 newspaper in @entity74 commented : ' this combines to make it increasingly difficult for opponents to raise further objections against the idea of a museum			0
@entity57 was always against the idea of turning the house into apartments and said : ' the desire not to want to have anything to do with @entity4 is fully understandable			1
but it would n't work , turning it in to a property			2
what would happen if a child lives in the house and his right - wing parents decide to call him @entity4 ? ' @entity4 ( pictured , left , in 1934 and , right , in 1935 ) was born at the house on april 20 , 1889			1
over the years since the end of the war the building has served as a bank , workshop , library , school and as a home for the disabled supporters of the remembrance project hope that it will slowly strip the house of its appeal for extremists who come every year on @entity4 's birthday to worship outside			1
this year a remembrance stone quarried from the site of the @entity109 concentration camp in @entity1 , where thousands were killed , was defaced with paint			0
@entity57 added : ' the house will only lose its appeal for such people when it stands as a clear and just symbol against @entity116			0
' mayor @entity117 said : ' it is a difficult subject			0
but the idea in principle of a @entity7 is , in itself , not a bad one			2
' after the @entity123 , when @entity4 absorbed @entity1 into @entity124 , the house was bought by @entity125 and became a @entity5 ' cultural centre			2
' anyone who wished to progress through party ranks was obliged to pay at least one visit there to pay homage to the leader			0
before the end of @entity135 fanatical nazis tried and failed to demolish the building but it fell into @entity139 hands			0
@entity142 's family bought the house in 1912 and , in a deal which gives her £ 4,000 - a - month rent , she leases it back to @entity13			0
that way the city fathers made sure no questionable - ie nazi - groups got their hands on it			0
the only @entity5 - era relic is on an iron gate outside , the @entity153 for @entity4 's party secretary @entity125			2
@entity155 , a local , said : ' it is about time we got rid of this eyesore and this shame			0
making it into a place of memory for the victims of @entity116 is a good idea			0
' a decision on what to do with it is expected within weeks .			0
