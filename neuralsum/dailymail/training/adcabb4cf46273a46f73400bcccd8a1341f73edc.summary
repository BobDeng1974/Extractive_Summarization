by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 05:51 est , 29 september 2013 he ’s jumped from the @entity2 and flown through a waterfall in the @entity4 , now wingsuit stuntman @entity5 has hurtled through a 20 - foot crack in a @entity8 mountain in what he has called the most technically demanding jump of his life			1
@entity5 – dubbed @entity12 – began his stunt by leaping out of a helicopter wearing a wingsuit that has thin membranes between the limbs and torso			2
he then flew towards @entity19 – which stands at 900 - feet – and zoomed through a fissure in it that measured between 15 and 60 feet in width and three football fields in length			1
he wrote on @entity40 afterwards : ' the weather opened for one hour and i nailed the stunt perfect			0
i flew through from beginning to end			2
' had a perfect opening and just barely made my landing area			0
it was without a doubt the most technically demanding jump of my life from exit to flying through the crack to opening to landing			1
i have never been happier			0
' he added on @entity55 : ' to call the flight narrow would be an understatement			0
' production company @entity58 made a video , which you can see below , of @entity5 's preparations for the incredible stunt , in which he explains how he 'll survive the feat. @entity5 deploys his parachute ( left ) after performing the daredevil feat , and is embraced by his mother ( right ) following his safe landing this isnt ' the first time @entity5 has performed a wingsuit stunt in @entity8			1
in 2011 he launched himself from a helicopter at 6,000ft and zoomed through the imposing @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity8			0
he was able to travelled for two - thirds of a mile - and through the 4,265ft mountain 's natural archway - before releasing his parachute and descending gently to the ground			1
the arch measures less than 100ft across and left the daredevil with little margin for error			0
@entity5 was the first wingsuit stuntman to fly in @entity8			2
the @entity85 wingsuiter gives an animated account of his daring feat to the media @entity5 ( right ) is presented with a certificate after his death - defying flight through a narrow crack in @entity19 , seen in the background high flyer : @entity5 zooms through the cave on @entity72 near @entity95 , @entity73 province , on september 24 , 2011			1

he had just four - feet either side as he flew through @entity19
@entity5 deployed his parachute just 300 feet above the ground
he called it the most technically demanding jump he *'d* ever *attempted*
