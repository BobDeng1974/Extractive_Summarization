' i 'm not going to nominate you , but will you throw the water over my head now , if we go outside ... there 's a paddling pool standing by ... would you throw a bucket ... ? mr @entity4 vowed to give money to mr @entity6 's mayor 's @entity59 , as well as to cancer and motor neurone disease charities mr @entity4 promised to make a donation to cancer and motor neurone disease charities , and to the mayor 's @entity59			1
