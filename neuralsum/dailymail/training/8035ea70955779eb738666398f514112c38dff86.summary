@entity8 , 66 , of @entity9 , west @entity10 , ignored concerns that @entity12 , 66 , was in excruciating pain following a simple procedure to replace the joint , the @entity7 was told			1
mr @entity12 , a retired builder from @entity17 , @entity18 , sustained an unexplained tear to his bowel during his stay at the @entity24 - run @entity22 in @entity25 , @entity10			1
prosecutor @entity26 told the jury he was in so much pain he called a doctor friend from his private hospital bed because he could not explain to the @entity32 doctor on duty the agony he was in			1
@entity12 ( left ) was in excruciating pain , the @entity7 heard			1
although dr @entity8 ( right ) knew his patient had a perforated bowel , he failed to operate for 40 hours , the jury was told he was given paracetamol and the pain started to ease			1
but by 3.15pm his pain rating was ‘ nine out of 10 ’ and there was a ‘ sudden spike ’ in his temperature , jurors were told			0
this serious condition quickly led to blood poisoning and mr @entity12 suffered a fatal heart attack on february 14 , 2010			1
although @entity8 knew his patient had a perforated bowel , he failed to operate for 40 hours , the jury was told			1
the surgeon went on to lie to coroner @entity52 , claiming to have viewed the 66 - year - old ’s scans much earlier than hospital records showed , it is alleged			2
opening the case , ms @entity55 said : ‘ this is a fairly common procedure and his consultant operated on him that day			0
‘ the operation went well and he was due to leave the hospital on monday , february 16			0
‘ however ... after the operation , while he was still in hospital , he developed abdominal pain			0
’ @entity8 , a general surgeon with a specialism in colorectal conditions , was asked to treat mr @entity12 , the jury was told			1
‘ the defendant agreed to do so and he saw mr @entity68 that evening ’ , miss @entity55 said			2
the @entity7 heard that mr @entity12 was in so much pain he called a doctor friend from his private hospital bed because he could not explain to the @entity32 doctor on duty the agony he was experiencing @entity8 quickly concluded mr @entity12 was suffering from a ruptured bowel , the court heard			1
‘ this is a serious and life - threatening condition and it requires an operation			0
‘ however , mr @entity8 did not agree for an operation to be performed immediately			2
‘ instead he decided to have a ct scan performed the next day			2
‘ however , again the defendant failed to carry out urgent surgery , even after being told the result of the ct scan			0
‘ he did not treat mr @entity12 ’ case as an urgent case ’ , miss @entity55 said			1
by the time mr @entity12 was brought into theatre , he ‘ had been in pain for over 40 hours and was in a critical condition ’			1
‘ the defendant did what he could to repair the damage , operating into the early hours of that saturday morning			0
‘ sadly , these efforts were all too late			0
he died the following day			0
‘ that death was avoidable			0
‘ had mr @entity8 simply operated the night before , or even early during the day of the february 12 , mr @entity12 would have had a very good chance of survival			1
‘ there was a series of missed opportunities and serious errors of judgment in his care of this patient and they combined to cause mr @entity12 ’ premature death and the standard of care was exceptionally bad			1
’ the ‘ catalogue of breaches of duty ’ amounted to manslaughter by gross negligence , miss @entity55 said			0
‘ during the coroner ’s inquest into mr @entity12 ’ death , this defendant was called to give evidence and before that he had supplied two statements for the purpose of the inquest			1
‘ the coroner asked him when had he first seen the results of the ct scan which he had delayed ... he said it was around lunchtime			2
‘ the inquest was adjourned without reaching any verdict , but when the defendant ’s evidence on that point was examined against electronic records that are held at the hospital			0
‘ these records demonstrated - without doubt - that mr @entity8 had first looked to see the records no earlier than 9pm , not around lunch as he had said			2
‘ the prosecution case is that in giving that evidence , which was untrue , this defendant deliberately sought to mislead the coroner			0
’ @entity140 was a senior lecturer in surgery at @entity142 from 1993 to 2000 and is an associate professor at a @entity144			0
