saints to make it seventh heaven the race for the top four has always been keenly contested , but it ’s normally between the same six sides : @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
now @entity10 are forcing people to reconsider and make it seven			2
that was an excellent point at @entity4 and , aside from poor marking for @entity16 ’s goal , the @entity12 were excellent at the back			1
they are so well organised , have an excellent midfield shield in @entity20 and @entity21 and @entity22 is a top goalkeeper			0
he was immense against @entity4 and has been a big plus since arriving from @entity26			1
the result keeps @entity29 ’s side in the hunt and , whatever happens , it ’s been a good season for @entity10			1
@entity10 team - mates congratulate goalscorer @entity35 after levelling the score at 1 - 1 in the first half 21 - @entity10 have conceded the fewest @entity39 goals this season and kept the joint-most clean sheets ( 13 )			1
they have made huge strides and anyone with a talented young lad would love them to play for that club			0
their transfer policy is sound and they are happy to give youth a chance thanks to their incredible academy facilities			1
some of the top clubs in @entity55 will be keeping tabs on @entity29 because he has done a fantastic job with a side many tipped for relegation			1
as for the race for the @entity61 ? if it keeps going as it is there are going to be some big clubs and good sides who miss out			1
@entity10 keeper @entity68 takes the ball away from @entity71 's head as the @entity12 defence holds firm @entity73 ( right ) posted on @entity74 after the @entity4 draw saying ' since 2010			1
# @entity75 ' @entity76 ! @entity77 typifies what has been good about @entity79 this season			1
he works so hard for his manager and his team - mates , but he ’s also got that little bit of quality to go with it			1
he scored a fantastic goal against @entity5 — it was superb technique and such a pure strike — but i was so impressed by his work ethic			0
he covered 8.4 miles on saturday — the fourth - highest distance in the league this season			1
and , incredibly , of the top 10 distances run in 2014 - 15 , six of them belong to @entity77			1
that is an incredible effort and exactly what managers want			0
@entity77 ( centre ) wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner against @entity105 @entity107 's @entity106 that was a shambolic performance from @entity5			1
i ca n’t understand how a team can go from being champions to being so slack			0
the players almost look bored and uninterested			0
it happened under @entity114 and it ’s happening under @entity115			0
every time @entity4 stutter , @entity5 fail to take advantage			1
i do n’t think you can pin it all on the manager , but he needs to do something and quick , because now they ’re looking over their shoulder at the chasing pack			0
@entity105 players traipse from the pitch after losing 1 - 0 to @entity79 at @entity127 on saturday evening £ 195m - the approximate cost of @entity105 ’s star - studded starting @entity130 at @entity127 this weekend - @entity79 ’s was less than £ 7 pain for @entity131 i ’ve played alongside @entity132 and he is one of the most passionate people in the game			1
that result will have hurt him			0
he took full responsibility after the game but that was one of the worst performances i have seen in the @entity140			0
they were sloppy with the ball and showed no real desire to get into the game			0
no wonder the supporters were venting their anger			0
@entity132 was left fuming in the @entity141 dugout after his side fell 4 - 0 behind to @entity150 by half - time pulis on the up @entity153 has his strikers firing but , most importantly for @entity155 , he has stopped them leaking goals			1
he builds teams from the back and it shows in the stats			0
at @entity162 last season they conceded far fewer goals after his arrival and it ’s the same now at the @entity166			1
he ’s such a specialist in the relegation scrap			0
@entity153 is doing a remarkable job at @entity169 as his side continue move towards safety @entity171 strikes again i ’ve never been his biggest fan , but credit where credit ’s due : @entity175 was outstanding against @entity176 on sunday			2
since he first arrived at the club he has had to fight perceptions and prove his worth			0
i still do n’t think in the long term he is a @entity7 player — he ’s certainly not someone to build a team around — but this season he has been one of their most effective players			2
@entity186 has made him his go - to man and it is paying off			2
he scored one , was involved in another and caused @entity9 the most problems			0
he was @entity7 ’s best outfield player against @entity6 and again on sunday , so fair play to him and @entity193 for making it work			0
@entity195 buries this chance for @entity198 's opener against @entity176 in the 3 - 0 victory @entity200 key to @entity201 i was speaking to @entity202 a few weeks ago and he said the biggest problem at @entity150 was that the players were paralysed by fear			1
@entity202 has come in and changed all that			0
he has @entity207 and @entity208 scoring but , more importantly , he has brought @entity209 back in from the cold			0
@entity211 froze him out but he is exactly the kind of creative force @entity150 were crying out for			0
he certainly does n’t play with fear and his energy and skill tore @entity141 apart			0
@entity217 ( right ) was in fine form for @entity150 against @entity141 on saturday afternoon blues are back it 's been a good week for @entity222 in a very tough season			1
the first half - hour against @entity225 was painful to watch last week — there was almost an anger around the ground at the way the team were playing			2
they had to fight so hard to get that win but you saw what it did for their confidence — they followed it with a big result against @entity241			0
i never felt they were in danger of being relegated and now they could go on a run and might even be @entity248 ’s last team standing in @entity55			1
@entity249 ( right ) opened the the scoring for @entity222 on sunday at @entity251 170 - @entity252 has attempted 170 dribbles in 2014 - 15 , more than @entity254 ( 160 ) and @entity255 ( 154 )			2
@entity162 's @entity256 @entity162 are flying under @entity257 and it ’s the wide men who are doing the damage			2
@entity252 and @entity260 were excellent but it was a tough result for @entity262			0
he looks like he ’s playing youngsters to please the chairman but this is a time to win points , not brownie points			0
170 @entity252 has attempted 170 dribbles in 2014 - 15 , more than @entity254 ( 160 ) and @entity255 ( 154 )			2
@entity252 ( left ) was in great form to provide two assists for @entity162 on saturday afternoon @entity270 's @entity271 3 - during their demolition of @entity274 on saturday , @entity162 scored three first - half goals for the first time in their six seasons in the @entity140			1
however , it was the third time this season that @entity274 had shipped three before the break			2
the fact that @entity283 scored from the furthest distance this @entity39 season ( 40 yards ) will be of little consolation for @entity287 fans			2
@entity283 fired in an unbelievable strike for @entity287 at @entity289 on saturday 18 - @entity260 had gone 18 @entity140 games without a goal or assist before saturday , but managed both in the first half against @entity274			2
21 - after failing to score in 21 games for @entity296 , @entity8 loanee @entity294 grabbed a hat - trick in his side ’s 3 - 0 win against @entity300			1
2005 - @entity6 have hit some excellent form in the second half of the season			1
the @entity304 have won eight straight home @entity39 games for the first time ever at the @entity308 and the first time overall since november 2005			0
12 - @entity150 scored as many goals in the first 18 minutes against @entity141 as they had in their previous 12 away league games ( two )			2
1 - @entity10 have not conceded more than a single goal in a @entity140 away game since the opening weekend of the season , when they lost 2 - 1 to @entity8 at @entity315			1
@entity294 ( centre ) celebrates after scoring for @entity296 against @entity300 at the @entity318 stadium			0

the @entity12 have a great chance qualifying for @entity55 next season
up to seven sides can realistically qualify for the @entity61
@entity29 's side played terrifically well to draw 1 - 1 at @entity4
