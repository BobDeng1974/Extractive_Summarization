by @entity0 sick of being the ' frumpy ' sibling , a woman has revealed how she shed five stone so she could become her attractive sister ’s body double			2
@entity6 , 54 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , used a photograph of her trim older sister , @entity10 , showing off her size eight figure to keep her motivated			1
born a year apart , the sisters were often mistaken for twins as children			1
so @entity6 was sure without the five stone weight difference between them , they could look identical again			1
i wan na be like you : left : @entity6 , right , lost five stone to look more like sister @entity10 , left			1
right : @entity6 's @entity23 , right , was always slender comfort eating : after she lost her husband to cancer @entity6 felt lost and alone and turned to food she said : ' i used my sister as a real life example of what i would look like if i finally managed to lose the weight			1
it kept me more motivated because she was living proof of how i would look and could dress if i stuck to the plan			2
' as soon as the weight started to come off people commented on how much more i looked like @entity10 and that kept me going			1
now we are mistaken for twins all the time			1
' sharing a wardrobe : when the sisters holidayed in @entity43 last year they took a case of matching clothes to celebrate @entity6 's weight loss growing up the women shared the same slim figures , but @entity6 gained weight after marrying husband @entity50			1
' it did n't bother me because he loved me as i was and we were so happy , ' she explains			0
she lost him to kidney cancer when he was 52 after they had been married for 25 years			2
without her childhood sweetheart , @entity6 felt lost and alone and turned to food for comfort			1
with grown up daughter , @entity61 , having left home , @entity6 had nothing to rush home from her supermarket job for so ended up stopping for a take away after work most evenings			1
' i used to love cooking , but it 's not as much fun for one so i could never be bothered , ' she explains			0
she also treated herself to bars of chocolate before bed and soon reached a size 18			2
meanwhile @entity10 had separated from her husband and thrown herself into the single scene			1
when she joined @entity78 dance classes , she urged her sister to get involved			0
but @entity6 felt too fat and unattractive to join			2
she says : ' my confidence was at rock bottom			0
i stayed in on my own all the time because i was too terrified to try anything new			0
' i was proud of @entity10 for being so confident and brave and wished i could be more like her			2
i knew it was my weight holding me back			0
' seeing double : born a year apart , the sisters were often mistaken for twins as children			1
@entity6 , left , was delighted when this happened again after she lost weight then a fall at work injured her shoulder and out of action for months , @entity6 gained even more weight			1
' i was stuck in front of the tv eating snacks all day			0
before i knew it i was a size 24			1
' @entity6 weighed 14 stone - almost double the weight of her eight stone sister			1
' once my shoulder recovered i could n’t wait to get back to work but hated the thought of everyone seeing how fat i was			0
' that 's when i decided i 'd had enough of being the fat frumpy sister			0
i wanted to be the slim , fun and sexy sister like @entity10			1
' who 's who ? the sisters now love to dress the same to fool people ' having my sister as my inspiration was more realistic than choosing a celebrity because i knew if i could just stick to it i really would look like her			2
she 's always looked lovely and wore trendy clothes			0
if i lost weight i knew i could too			0
' with her sister 's support , @entity6 followed a low fat diet and started exercising in her front room			1
after losing two stone she found the confidence to join her sister 's dance class and compliments started flooded in			2
' the people were lovely and all told me how much i looked like @entity10 , i was thrilled because it meant my diet was working			2
' the dancing helped her to lose even more weight and within a year she had lost five stone			2
inspired : @entity6 , seen here after her 5st weight loss , used her sister as a real life example of what she could look like ' @entity10 was my biggest supporter			1
she was fantastic and urged me to keep going so we could swap clothes liked we used to as kids , ' @entity6 said			2
@entity6 knew she had achieved her aim when one day the sisters were out shopping when a stranger asked if they were twins			1
' nobody had said that it over 40 years			0
it was the best compliment ever and i was delighted			0
' with a new wardrobe to fit her new size eight body , @entity6 and @entity10 often accidentally ended up in similar outfits			1
' one night at dancing we 'd both worn white jeans and pink tops and someone asked if we were identical twins			0
it gave us an idea and we went shopping for some matching outfits as a laugh			0
' the women were in fits of giggles as they both tried on matching leopard print playsuits			0
@entity6 said : ' we could n't believe what we were wearing at our age but at dance class we were encouraged to wear over the top gear so we thought what the heck and bought them			2
' the reaction we got was amazing			0
people were so kind and flattering			0
' the women started dressing as ' twins ' more often			0
' it might sound odd but it was good fun and gave us both such a laugh			0
we were so close we might as well have been twins , ' @entity6 explains			1
when they sisters holidayed in @entity43 last year they took a case of matching gear to celebrate @entity6 's weight loss			1
' we got a lot of attention dressing as twins , especially from younger men			0
it was such a confidence boost			0
' i never thought i would be having such a good time at this age , but thanks to my sister i 'm having double the fun			0

@entity6 used sister @entity10 as motivation to lose weight
dropped from 14st and size 24 at *5ft* *1in* to *9st*
gained weight after losing husband to cancer and turning to comfort food
as children she and her older sister were often mistaken for twins
now they choose to dress alike
