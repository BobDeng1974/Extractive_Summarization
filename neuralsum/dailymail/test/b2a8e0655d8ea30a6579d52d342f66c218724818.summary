@entity1 ’s feud with @entity2 has erupted once more following an explosive press conference at the @entity4			1
@entity1 controlled the race in @entity6 to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the formula one world championship			1
but @entity2 was furious with his @entity13 team - mate , accusing him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from @entity17 's @entity16			1
@entity1 celebrates his win with the @entity13 team , but @entity2 appears less pleased with 2nd @entity1 crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in @entity24 @entity1 and @entity2 spray champagne from the podium as @entity13 celebrate a one - two finish click here to read @entity30 's report from @entity6 as @entity1 wins with the top three drivers covered by only 3.5secs ahead of the final round of pit - stops , @entity2 reported on the radio that ‘ @entity1 is driving very slowly			1
tell him to speed up			0
’ @entity1 , seemingly protecting his tyres , was given the hurry - up by @entity13 and both he and @entity2 eventually emerged from their final pit - stop first and second with @entity16 third			1
asked about the message , @entity1 , with @entity2 sitting next to him in the press conference , replied : ' i was n't controlling his race , i was controlling my own race			1
' my goal was to look after my car			0
i had no real threat from @entity2 throughout the whole race			1
' the last remark , in particular , was a dig in the ribs for @entity2 , who has been out - qualified and finished behind @entity1 at every race so far this season			1
a clearly fuming @entity2 replied : ' it 's just now interesting to hear from you @entity1 that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race			1
' driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant @entity16 was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for @entity16 to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then i had to cover him			2
' it was unnecessarily close with @entity16 as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time because i had to cover him			2
then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer , so i 'm unhappy about that			2
' @entity2 was clearly angry with @entity1 in the press conference and hit out at his team - mate the @entity78 driver denied he had done anything wrong following @entity2 's accusations @entity1 backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team - mate 's race @entity1 waves to the crowd from the podium as @entity2 reflects on finishing behind his team - mate asked to respond , @entity1 defended himself as he said : ' it 's not my job to look after @entity2 's race , it 's my job to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible			1
' that 's what i did			0
i did n't do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up , i was just focused on myself			0
if @entity2 wanted to get by he could have tried , but he did n't			1
' the spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out - manoeuvre , and at times out - pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded			1
it culminated in @entity2 and @entity1 colliding with one another in the @entity108 @entity4 , resulting in the former being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team			1
it proved to be a turning point in the championship as @entity1 went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown			1
was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from @entity17 and , also , can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up ? were you aware that @entity2 was getting so backed - up towards @entity16 ? @entity124 : i was n’t controlling his race , i was controlling my own race but , great race , i ’m really happy			1
definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the @entity133 were very , very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres			2
so , today the real goal was to manage the tyres			0
and , as i said , my goal was to look after my car			0
i had no real threat from @entity2 through the whole race			1
so , i just managed it and got to really enjoy it , to be honest			0
a few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop , which i really enjoyed			0
ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole , full practice sessions , on my side of the garage at least			2
and it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race			2
so really happy , and yeah , kinda excited			0
q : @entity2 , can you talk us through your view of the race today			1
started second , finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at timed under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe ? @entity169 : no. it ’s just now interesting to hear from you , @entity1 , that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front , and necessarily that was compromising my race			1
driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that @entity16 was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for @entity16 to try that early pit - stop to try and jump me			2
and then i had to cover him			0
so , first of all it was unnecessarily close with @entity16 as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because i had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer			2
so i ’m unhappy about that , of course , today			0
other than that , not much to say			0
q : @entity1 , would you like to respond ? @entity124 : not really ! my job is not to … it ’s not my job to look after @entity2 ’s race			1
my job ’s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible – and that ’s what i did			0
i did n’t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up			0
i just was focussing on myself			0
if @entity2 wanted to get by he could have tried but he did n’t			2
the @entity78 driver crosses the line in @entity6 after holding off the challenge from @entity2 and @entity16 @entity1 leads off the start - line as he moves off the race line to defend his lead the @entity78 driver controlled the race as he claimed his fourth victory in @entity24 speaking to the @entity215 , @entity2 was asked about the incident			1
' it compromised my race massively at the time because the best possible race for @entity1 was to back me off into @entity16 so @entity16 would try to undercut me and i would have to respond , ' he said			1
' it was very frustrating @entity1 was taking it as easy on his tyres			2
interestingly , he said he was just thinking about himself and that says it all			0
what upset me is we went through exactly that before the race			0
' @entity1 denied the accusation : ' that 's absolutely not the case			1
i was n't trying to back him up into @entity16 because ultimately we do need a one - two and that is a priority to the team			2
if he wanted to get close to overtake he could have done			0
i 'm not really quite sure what his problem is			0
' we came here to get one - two and we did			0
there should n't be too much aggro really			0
