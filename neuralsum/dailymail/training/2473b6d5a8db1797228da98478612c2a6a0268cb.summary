by @entity0 last updated at 8:18 am on 26th february 2012 it has been impossible to miss them over the past few weeks			0
three words emblazoned across vast billboards , printed over images of teenage girls in tiaras and extravagantly frothy wedding dresses			0
three words that reveal everything about the subtlety of the programme they are advertising : bigger , fatter , @entity14			0
the arrival of the second series of the @entity18 documentary @entity17 has been accompanied by the sort of fanfare reserved for guaranteed smash - hits			1
the confidence is well - placed			1
the reality show exploring the lavish nuptials of young gypsy couples – in particular , the enormous , glitter - encrusted gowns worn by the brides – has become an unexpected phenomenon			1
extravagant : @entity29 , a barmaid , marries traveller @entity30 in the first series the first series , broadcast early in 2011 , became the channel ’s highest rating documentary of all time , peaking at 9.7 million viewers – equivalent to the last episode of friends			1
but the programme is n’t such a hit with many of the travellers , who feel it only fuels prejudice against them			0
‘ the production company has shamelessly cashed in on the success of the show – and having seen it happen , many of the gypsies have become angry that they are opening their lives to ridicule without seeing any of the rewards , ’ says a source			1
there are also disturbing allegations about what really goes on behind the scenes			0
according to sources close to the production , the company behind it , @entity57 , has made secret cash payments to gypsies to persuade them to appear			1
there has also been speculation as to why some of the male gypsies in recent programmes have had their faces pixelated			0
and it is claimed the producers have rehearsed and reshot scenes and have egged on teenage girls to wear provocative clothing in a process described by insiders as ‘ nurtured reality ’			0
young bride @entity77 will be seen in a pineapple dress in series two but @entity81 is unabashed and determined to cash in on the phenomenon it has created			1
the company is lining up a series of specials to follow on from its festive money - spinner , my big fat @entity87			1
one will focus on @entity92 , the woman who makes the extraordinary wedding dresses			0
a second will be a @entity96 version , which will follow @entity98 members of the cult as they prepare for a mass wedding ceremony			0
and there will be a series about @entity104 gypsies			1
remarkably , @entity81 is even trying to produce a version focusing on the weddings of criminals , entitled , predictably , @entity108			0
@entity17 began life as just a one - off @entity111 programme in 2010			1
unexpectedly , it was a massive hit for @entity18 , attracting 5.3 million viewers , five times the normal total for @entity111			0
a full five - part series followed , ordered by @entity18 commissioning editor @entity116 , who claimed it would ‘ answer some of the more probing questions raised by the first film ’			1
it was made by @entity81 , which was established by @entity121 in one room in @entity124 ’s @entity123 in 2003			0
the company had previously been known for so - called ‘ shock docs ’ with titles such as @entity128 ! , @entity129 and @entity130			1
billed as a fascinating insight into the secretive world of the traveller community , the programme revealed the eye - popping extravagance of gypsy nuptials , in which the brides – average age 17 – don dresses so vast and bedecked with ornaments that they are often left with scars around their waists from the boning			1
it also highlighted the dichotomy between the strict moral code obeyed by young traveller girls – no dating , premarital sex or drinking – and their provocative way of dressing up			0
but according to a source , finding enough gypsies to fill a series in just ten months of production was very difficult for its makers , led by @entity160 , @entity81 ’s head of programmes and the executive producer of the series			1
‘ it is well known that payments were made to the gypsies who appeared in the first series , ’ claims the source			1
‘ it ’s understood @entity81 paid cash for photographs and other expenses			1
’ but the series failed to answer many pertinent questions , such as where the gypsies found the six - figure sums often spent on the weddings			1
and while it claimed to show the traveller way of life without judgment , members of the community were unhappy about the portrayal of gypsy girls as uneducated drudges , obsessed with outlandish clothing			1
wedded to fantasy : @entity92 puts the finishing touches to bride @entity191 's lavish dress all dressed up : critics say the girls ' clothing is far too provocative they also argued that the use of circus music and subtitles for gypsies speaking @entity199 exploited the participants and invited viewers to mock them			1
nonetheless , the programme made stars of some of its subjects , particularly @entity207 , an @entity209 traveller and former bare - knuckle boxer who went on to win celebrity @entity212 last month			2
the show also transformed the fortunes of @entity81			2
the once tiny outfit is now 60 - strong and operates from smart offices in @entity217 , with a second branch in @entity219 , @entity220 , where @entity121 is based			1
its turnover last year was £ 11 million and it is thought new figures will be much higher			0
shortly after @entity17 was shown in @entity98 , the company secured a deal with @entity104 cable network @entity225 worth £ 2.6 million			2
the original @entity98 series was a surprise ratings hit in the @entity104 , and @entity225 commissioned @entity81 to produce an eight - part series called @entity229			1
it will be aired later this year and will explore the lives of travellers – mostly @entity232 – living in the @entity104			0
although the @entity104 broadcasters were eager to own the rights to the programme , @entity81 has held on to them			0
the first @entity98 series of @entity17 has also been bought by other broadcasters around the world			2
to date , it has generated sales revenues of £ 3.5 million from deals in 81 territories , including countries in @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246			1
@entity81 is thrilled with its success			0
‘ @entity160 has become known as the @entity250 since he hit the jackpot with the show , ’ says a source			2
‘ they ’re making a fortune , but they ’re incredibly tight when it comes to production budgets			0
the extravagant lifestyles of the community has meant it has a keen following members of the community have been unhappy with the way hey have been portrayed ‘ they ’ve become known in the industry as being very ruthless			0
’ @entity81 is now experiencing a backlash from the gypsies who , despite the payments for the first series , do not feel they have made their fair share of the profits			1
a source says the gypsies are aware of the way they were portrayed in the first series and the money it made			2
for the second series , the gypsies demanded more money , but it was then decided not to pay any of them			2
the argument was that fame should be enough – but it meant @entity81 struggled to get enough gypsies to co-operate			0
‘ some of the people shown in the new series had their faces obscured – they are the ones who refused to sign the consent forms because of disagreements with the programme ’s makers , ’ a source says			2
it is also claimed some scenes in the latest series are rehearsed prior to filming to ensure they meet the makers ’ requirements			2
for instance , last week ’s show featured a 15 - year - old girl planning her wedding , which will take place when she turns 16			1
she and her teenage friends were seen clad in provocative outfits – but the show source says : ‘ they were encouraged by the producers to wear those skimpy outfits			2
’ @entity81 ’s latest and most audacious idea , my @entity309 , is intended to give an insight into another secretive section of society – this time , people known and feared for their illegal activities			0
it is perhaps unsurprising that the project has proved more difficult than the company anticipated			2
it has been suggested that some of scenes were recreated so that they met the requirements of the programme - makers piled up : the travellers take over the road during one of the shows many infamous criminals have been approached by the production company , but it is understood to be struggling to convince them to appear and has been reduced to trawling lapdancing clubs in @entity124 and @entity332 to find potential subjects			1
@entity81 can not pay contributors due to @entity336 rules stating criminals can not benefit financially from their crimes			0
one of those approached was @entity340 , who served 16 years in prison for his involvement in the disposal of the body of @entity345 , one of @entity347 ’s victims			0
he declined to take part			0
he told @entity349 : ‘ weddings are a very personal thing and i turned @entity81 down because i thought they were really pushing their luck with a series about criminals ’ weddings			2
the gypsy series was bad enough			2
i mean , why would any self - respecting “ face ” want to allow cameras into such an event ? ’ speaking on behalf of @entity18 and @entity57 , a spokesman said : ‘ the programme is an observational documentary series and we absolutely refute any allegations that any elements are staged			1
everything featured is a fair and accurate reflection of what we experienced during filming			0
the producers of the show do not pay for the weddings and contributors are not paid			0
‘ in a few instances , a small facilitation fee may be given to cover any arrangements the participants have had to make to fit in with the filming schedule – for example covering loss of earnings or childcare arrangements , which is common practice in the industry			0

newly rich company behind **tv** series now has *swanky* offices in @entity390 and @entity246
but ' exploited ' *bypsies* could stage *boycott* - despite claims of secret cash payments
is that why **tv** *bosses* are planning a new show *...* my @entity400 ?
