a horror fan dressed as a zombie and covered in fake blood sparked a police hunt after terrified children called 999 - convinced he had been attacked			1
horror movie fan @entity6 , 17 , was posing for his make - up artist sister @entity7 who had decked him out in gruesome looking injuries for a photoshoot in @entity10			1
but when she started taking pictures of her brother on the street , two children playing nearby thought @entity6 's make - up was real and called police in a panic			1
@entity7 , 23 , from @entity32 , @entity10 , who has recently completed a course in media and make - up at @entity36 , said : ' i could n't believe it when the officers approached me and told me what had happened			1
' they had received a report of a badly injured man in the area and assumed the worst			2
i was shocked at first but now i feel quite flattering to think the makeup looked so real			0
during the makeover @entity6 had fake blood spattered over a white shirt and was made up to look as if he had suffered horrific gashes across his face , with part of his cheek missing			1
the makeup started with latex , around half an hour of drying and wax to recreate gashes			0

right is another design two of @entity7 's other designs for her portfolio			0
she 's recently completed a course in media and make - up at @entity36 @entity7 then added fake blood and mud to finish before the pair went to @entity70 to take photographs of her work			1
she said : ' my plan was to make @entity6 look as terrifying as possible and the whole make - up process took about an hour			1
' i have to say i myself could n't even bear to look at him when i had finished , it gave me the chills - i suppose that 's the sign of a good make - up artist			1
' i found the perfect setting for the shoot , across the road from my mum 's house in a disused building			0
we got a couple of strange looks from people as we were walking over but i never thought that people would think that @entity6 's make - up was real			1
' it 's all boarded up at the back of the club so we went there and i just asked my brother to walk around to get some action shots			0
then all of a sudden these two police officers started to walk towards us and i was worried i was going to get in trouble because it 's private land			2
' they then said a couple of kids had just seen my brother walking around like a zombie and presumed he had been injured in some kind of assault			0
the kids only looked about eight and they were too scared to look at him			0
the pair are pictured without make - up on			1
@entity7 said : ' i still have to finish my portfolio but i am now confident of my skills			0
i will just have to make sure my shoots are done indoors now and away from the public ' ' i did n't know what to say , i was lost for words - by this point a crowd had gathered and i remembered two young boys crying as @entity6 looked so scary			2
thankfully the police had a laugh and a joke about it too			2
' i know this sounds bad but i was actually delighted to get the reaction i did - i just feel bad that i scared a couple of kids in the process			0
if i can make someone believe that my brother was a zombie then my work here is done			0
' sgt @entity133 of @entity134 said : ' on our arrival , it was clear that there was indeed a male wearing torn clothing , who was covered in blood and appeared to have a severe facial injury and who was stood with a female			0
' unfortunately for them , some houses overlooked the building and the occupants had phoned the police			0
the make - up was extremely effective and would not have looked out of place on @entity153			2
