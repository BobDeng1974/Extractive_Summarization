by @entity0 speculation is mounting that giant panda @entity2 is pregnant after staff at @entity5 confirmed they were ' pretty sure ' she is expecting			1
@entity2 was artificially inseminated with samples from the zoo ’s male panda , @entity8 , in april , after introductions between the pair were attempted but unsuccessful			1
keepers have been raising hopes that it will be third time lucky after the couple failed to mate in 2012 and @entity2 lost a foetus late in pregnancy in 2013			2
although she has conceived , her pregnancy is not yet certain as fertilised giant panda eggs do not immediately implant on the mother ’s uterine wall - but instead ' float ' around in the reproductive tract for varying lengths of time			1
and if the embryo has successfully implanted into @entity2 ’s womb , a baby panda could arrive as early as next month			1
if successful it will make history as the first baby giant panda born in the @entity28			1
however , keepers will not know for sure until just before the panda gives birth			0
lain @entity43 , director of @entity44 for the @entity45 , hoped pregnancy would begin in 20 to 30 days			0
' a technique called a cp test - ceruloplasmin to give it the proper name - was performed using urine samples at seven to ten days after artificial insemination in april and this indicates that @entity2 has conceived			1
' @entity2 pictured relaxing in her compound in @entity5 after her first round of artificial insemination mr @entity43 said : ' it is important to stress that this test tells us only that she has conceived , not that implantation has occurred , as pandas practise delayed implantation			1
' after this , if successful , @entity2 would give birth roughly around late august			2
' at this stage the embryo is still in diapause or rest , so technically pregnancy has not occurred yet			0
' there are many more significant developments still to happen			0
@entity2 is in great health - very relaxed , at a great weight and eating well and keepers and scientists continue to monitor her			2
' panda expert @entity75 said the positive test was ' a good thing ' , and made a pregnancy more likely			0
he said : ' she has conceived , but that does n’t mean it ’s sure that she is pregnant			0
' it ’s always a wait until the final minute , so it ’s not certain that something will happen this summer in @entity5 - but it makes it possible			0
it ’s already a good thing , but it ’s still early			0
' the artificial insemination was carried out in april and pregnancy would be expected to come to term in late august or early september			1
keepers will now be looking for signs of changed behaviour in @entity2 , particularly in terms of how she is nesting			0
giant panda @entity2 , which means @entity99 , and @entity8 , which means @entity101 , became the first to live at a @entity28 zoo in 17 years when they arrived in december 2011			1
both pandas are currently ten years old and on loan from @entity106 until 2021			0
a zoo spokeswoman added : ' there is no definitive information , but we are obviously very hopeful for it			0
' @entity2 , pictured left , previously failed to reproduce with the zoo 's male panda @entity8 , right			1
zoo bosses were hopeful the two would mate but moved to artificial insemination after her hormone levels started to fall zookeepers will now be on the lookout for signs of a change in behaviour for @entity2 , particularly in how she is nesting			2

@entity5 's giant panda @entity2 has conceived following artificial insemination using samples from male panda @entity8
however the species ' *biological* trait of ' delayed implantation ' means total certainty of pregnancy still not possible
if successful , a new baby panda could be born as early as next month and would become the first giant panda born in @entity28
