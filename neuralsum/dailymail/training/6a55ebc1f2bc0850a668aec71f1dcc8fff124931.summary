fitting : the services , held by the @entity13 , take place on the village green where poems are read out beneath a union jack flag , lowered to half mast paying their respects : the @entity8 veterans have held in excess of 250 services for dead soldiers since they first began around three years ago veteran @entity62 , 64 , of @entity8 , said : ' it might be a slightly unusual thing to do , but we want to show the families of dead soldiers our support			1
' normally we hold services for soldiers who have been killed during service in @entity4 , but we were moved by what happened to @entity5 , and wanted to show our solidarity			0
' the @entity8 veterans are all ex forces , and we believe in offering as much support to the armed forces as we can			1
' the services are usually very well attended and are moving			0
