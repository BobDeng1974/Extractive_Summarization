' when i asked him why , he asked me if i was a @entity71			0

' when i returned to work relationships became strained for me			0

' i felt that my support of mr @entity85 had been seen as negative by those that employed me			2

he told the judge he had found the images degrading and disgusting and thought they were homophobic			0
however , when he complained to mr @entity43 , the manager told him to ' lighten up ' and that it was just ' banter			2
' he told the hearing that mr @entity43 had also made jibes about his hair loss including saying ' here comes the bald queer ' which he described as ' very hurtful			2
' ' i believe that @entity43 's comments were made because he does not like homosexuals and that he would do anything to be nasty and create difficulties for me at work because of my assistance to @entity85 in 2012			0
' i had started to question my sexuality which i had never done before			0
i no longer wanted to get out of bed in the mornings			0

' mr @entity159 's behaviour towards me was aggressive , ' he added			2
' i thought he was going to physically attack me in the pool			0
he was so angry and hostile towards me			0
the public and staff that were present were completely silent			2
' mr @entity0 told the hearing that he had now given up hope of resuming his teaching career			1
' i 'm effectively prohibited from using pools near to me because of the events and the individuals , ' he said			0
defending the centre , @entity178 said his claims of homophobia were not true and added : ' you left because you did n't want the practice on one to ones to change and you did n't like being told not to wear your wetsuit in the pool			2

former centre manager @entity189 told the tribunal that the 31 - year - old had been overlooked for a promotion because of his sexuality			1
he said superior mr @entity43 , told him in a meeting that he did not think a ' gay ' should run the swimming school because ' we might lose customers			2
' mr @entity189 added that staff had been told to ' keep the heat off ' mr @entity43 and said : ' in essence he was untouchable and was allowed to operate outside of the normal rules ' almost every month @entity43 would ask me to check @entity0 's timesheets			1
he never told me why , not did he ever ask me to do this for any of the other swimming instructors			0
' leisure assistant @entity206 spoke of the bullying culture at the centre and said the environment was ' the worst i have worked in			2
' ' @entity159 likes to throw his weight around ... he is power hungry			0
he said to me once in staff training that he likes the fear he induces , ' he said			0
he added that @entity214 , who was chairing a grievance hearing into the dispute , told him that homophobic remarks such as ' alright gayboy ' were ' banter ' and ' part of the environment of working in leisure			0
' swimming instructor @entity223 recalled an incident when mr @entity43 made apparently derogatory remarks about mr @entity0 's partner			1
he said he was in the swim office with mr @entity0 and his partner @entity228 when mr @entity43 walked in and said ' @entity0 and i are going to run away together			1
' when mr @entity0 explained that mr @entity228 was his boyfriend , mr @entity43 said ' each to their own ' before waving his hands in the air and walking off			1
' i did not know if @entity43 's comments were made because @entity0 and @entity228 are homosexual and that he disapproved of their relationship , or if it was because @entity228 is half @entity236			1
' i do believe either of the reasons for his comment would have made it inappropriate to say and clearly , in my opinion , discriminatory in nature			0
' the tribunal was adjourned until tomorrow .			0
