@entity1 women are covering up in unprecedented numbers , with just one in fifty now willing to go topless on the beach - and @entity1 's free - falling economy could be to blame			1
according to a poll by the @entity1 edition of @entity9 this summer , just two per cent of women surveyed are now happy to shed their bikini tops when sunbathing			1
and according to one sociologist , a general air of low confidence in the country thanks to its consistently poor economic performance could be behind the cultural shift			1
she said : ' @entity1 has also been hard hit by austerity since the start of the financial crisis			1
' if breast - baring is a sign of risk and revolution , covering up is a sign of safety			2
in uncertain times , you always dress more conservatively			2
' the survey shows a dramatic change of attitude in @entity1 , which used to be a haven of toplessness , even when it was taboo across most of the world in the 1960s			1
reluctant : an air of depression thanks to the poor @entity1 economy has been suggested as a possible cause actress @entity51 , who appeared in sexually - charged films of the era and was photographed holidaying topless in the @entity55			1
but now women are far more hesitant , from @entity57 to @entity58 , according to the magazine survey			2
@entity60 , 60 , sunbathes in @entity61 often , and said : ' it 's seen as vulgar			0
people are more prudish these days			2
' meanwhile @entity66 , 22 , in a bikini , chimed in : ' i 've never done it			0
i 'd be too embarrassed			0
' @entity69 also suggested the decline was because today 's women have forgotten the freedoms won by feminists in decades past			1
@entity75 difference : in the 1960s @entity1 stars like @entity51 , pictured above in a 1963 film , led the way by regularly going topless she said : ' @entity1 young women today are more conformist			1
they 've already attained freedom ... so they 've gotten lazy and taken it for granted			0
' in one @entity61 park , local authorities have gone so far to erect signs reminding women in the area to remember their bikini tops			2
social media has also been mooted as a culprit			0
@entity92 , a 22 - year - old beach monitor at @entity94 , an artificial beach in the capital , said some sunbathers could be discouraged by the rise of phone cameras			0
he said : ' i see lots of old men loitering around here , ' he said			0
' i have to stop them from taking photos on their phones			0
it happens all the time			0

poll this summer showed that hardly any @entity1 women prepared to strip off
sociologist has suggested people are more modest *due* to poor economy
far *cry* from 1960s when figures like @entity51 led topless revolution
