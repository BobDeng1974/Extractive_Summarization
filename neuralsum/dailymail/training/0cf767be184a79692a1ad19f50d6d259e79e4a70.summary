in the future astronauts on missions to distant worlds like @entity3 will print some of the tools they need and , maybe one day , even their food			1
now an important first step to realising that dream has been achieved , as @entity9 has made the first 3d - printed object in space			1
using a printer installed on the @entity14 earlier this month , the crew created a calibration object and will eventually use it to make useful items			2
they used a printer built by @entity23 - based company made in @entity24			1
it was taken to the @entity14 in september by @entity27 's @entity26			1
the demonstration is an important step to having ' replicators ' on future missions the device was created by @entity23 - based company made in @entity24 , who were contracted by @entity9 to design it for the @entity14 called the @entity35 in @entity36 , it aims to show the ' additive manufacturing ' technique can make @entity35 printed parts and tools in space			1
the first object that has now been printed was a faceplate engraved with the names of @entity9 and made in @entity24 written on it			1
3d printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file			0
they work in an extremely simple way , by building up a 3d object from layers of material			2
like a traditional inkjet printer , material , usually plastic , is laid down on a base			0
further layers are simply printed on top , gradually revealing a 3d object			2
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
many believe it could even lead to ' mini factories ' for living rooms allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a replacement part for a broken household appliance			0
the printer was installed on the station by astronaut @entity75 , in the station 's @entity76 , which is used for conducting science and technology experiments			0
the printer used plastic to form the first of a series of calibration coupons			0
it works by heating a relatively low - temperature plastic filament to build parts layer by later in designs supplied to the machine			0
the printer left @entity90 in september 2014 on @entity27 's fourth commercial resupply mission			1
about 20 objects will be printed in the next few weeks , and early next year they will be brought back to @entity90 by the @entity26 for analysis			1
@entity9 will study the objects to see how zero - gravity conditions affect the printing process , although from these early tests there seems to be few inhibitions , if any			0
' when the first human fashioned a tool from a rock , it could n't have been conceived that one day we 'd be replicating the same fundamental idea in space , ' @entity100 , ceo of made in @entity24 , said in a statement			2
the printer was installed on the station by astronaut @entity75 , in the station 's @entity76 ( shown ) , which is used for conducting science and technology experiments			0
the printer used plastic to form the first of a series of calibration coupons the device was created by @entity23 - based company made in @entity24 ( shown on parabolic flight ) , who were contracted by @entity9 to design it for the iss. called the @entity35 in @entity36 , it aims to show the ' additive manufacturing ' technique can make @entity35 printed parts and tools in space			1
according to the company , the presence of a 3d printer on the @entity14 will allow hardware designs to be made on @entity90 and then digitally beamed to the space station			1
physical objects can then be made in a matter of hours			0
' this printer is a critical first step for in - space manufacturing , ' said @entity137 , director of @entity9 's @entity138 at @entity139 in @entity140			1
' additive manufacturing with 3 - d printers will allow space crews to be less reliant on supply missions from @entity90 and lead to sustainable , self - reliant exploration missions where resupply is difficult and costly			2
' the space station provides the optimal place to perfect this technology in microgravity			0
' and @entity151 , @entity9 's 3d printer project manager , added : ' the goal of the first phase of printing is to verify that the 3 - d printing process works the same in microgravity as it does on the ground			2
' once we confirm that the process works , we will move to the second phase of printing which focuses more on the design and utilisation of the parts we print , which will ultimately lead to establishing an on - demand machine shop in space			0

astronauts on the @entity14 have printed the first 3d object in space
they used a printer built by @entity23 - based company made in @entity24
it was taken to the @entity14 in september by @entity27 's @entity26
the demonstration is an important step to having ' replicators ' on missions
@entity9 *envisages* that future astronauts might one day print many of the things they need , from tools to even food
about 20 objects will be printed in the next few weeks to be analysed back on @entity90 to check the technology works *properly*
