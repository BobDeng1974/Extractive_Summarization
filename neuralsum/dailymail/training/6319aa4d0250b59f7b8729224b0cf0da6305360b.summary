back in the 1890s , the @entity1 ships used to ferry passengers and supplies along @entity6 ’s rugged coastline			1
and the tradition continues today , with human cargo transported from @entity9 to @entity10 and all ports in between			1
my adventure starts at the town of @entity15 ( pronounced @entity16 ) , inside the @entity17			1
lots of places call themselves ‘ the gateway to ... ’ , but @entity15 really is a frontier town , where you can feel the full force of the @entity17			1
i ’m enjoying wandering around in layers of wool			1
i must look the part because two builders pull over in their truck to ask me directions			1
and then suddenly my ship comes in			1
@entity15 in @entity6 really is a frontier town where you can feel the full force of the @entity17 @entity33 , where our writer @entity34 ' @entity37 cruise journey began @entity38 and @entity39 star @entity34 the @entity40 completely dominates the quayside - and on we trundle			1
it ’s straight to the cabin to unpack			2
ship cabins are marvellous for stowage because everything has to be secure to avoid breakage , so if you enjoy a cubby - hole , you ’ll love this			1
there ’s no tv , no radio , and a porthole the size of a bathmat			2
the beds are single with a patent couchette system so the sofa spins over and underneath is the mattress , with crisp linen and a proper @entity63 duvet			2
it ’s time for a sundowner before we leave port			2
he ’s been at sea all his life			2
the captain may think he rules this ship , but it ’s @entity68 ’s home , and we are his guests			1
like all great barmen he makes people feel comfortable enough to drink and relax , but not comfortable enough to misbehave			2
at 18.15 we ’re off			2
i ask a chatty man if there is a difference between the northern and southern @entity6 accents and he answers : ‘ yes , in the south the endings of the words go up , and in the north the endings of the words go down			2
’ the @entity40 cruise ship , the vessel for the five - day voyage , where @entity68 's bar really is the hub a five - day @entity95 with @entity96 ( @entity97 , 0121 213 0012 ) costs from £ 799pp including flights , transfers and half - board accommodation			1
the food is good on board			0
we have cauliflower soup ( tasty and comforting ) , @entity17 char ( perfectly cooked fish ) , rice pudding and some delicious wine			0
i have an @entity110 @entity109			0
suddenly , there ’s an announcement from the bridge , followed by a mini stampede to the promenade deck			0
it ’s dark and cloudy , but there ’s something behind the clouds			0
they clear , and there above us all are the @entity37			1
much brighter than i had imagined , extra-terrestrial , silent , solemn and very beautiful			0
imagine you have never seen a rainbow before , and then you do			0
i feel blessed , as the light pulsates , moves , dances			0
the @entity37 ' pulsate , move and dance , @entity34 writes , as seen from the deck of the @entity133 it ’s march - and grey			1
but @entity6 does grey like @entity135 does green			0
i never get bored watching that beautiful sea through my porthole , the wave crests , gulls , snow , cliffs , seals and clouds , all grey turning always to silver when lit. at one point , there ’s a knot - tying class on deck , after which i opt to go on a dog - sled excursion in @entity10 , on the borders of @entity152 and @entity153			1
here there is a local freedom of movement so the @entity6 go to @entity152 to shop for vodka and the @entity152 come to @entity6 to shop for nappies			0
@entity10 is also a centre for the sport of dog - sledding , and husky teams are a status symbol			1
there are about 50 private teams and the major races are a big deal			0
a team of huskies lead a sled through the snow of @entity10 , on the borders of @entity152 and @entity153 when you see photos of the great polar explorers with their sled teams , the animals are big			1
here , they were trim and athletic			0
it ’s much faster than i imagined			0
the dogs are keen to run , and stopping them can be a problem			0
we are nomadic , some of us more than others			0
a journey is a marvellous thing and this one made me want to go further north to see the polar bears of @entity192 ; to stand on the ice that floats on the top of the world , to see a @entity196 or a sea lion not in a zoo			0
there is nothing as restful as curiosity .			0

@entity34 took an @entity95 with @entity96
out of @entity15 , he saw the @entity37 from a @entity133 cruise ship
a *speedy* dog - sledding excursion in @entity10 is also on the agenda
