the attacker has come under fire for the number of times he appealed for a penalty during @entity5 ’s win over @entity12 on saturday			1
it was a spot - kick that won @entity5 the game , after the referee @entity15 adjudged @entity16 to have clipped @entity4 inside the @entity12 box			1
penalty : this foul from @entity16 resulted in a penalty which @entity21 scored to put @entity5 through theatrical : @entity4 's tendency to go down against @entity12 led to their manager criticising him ‘ he was my player and i know better than many what a fantastic player he is ’ , said @entity0 , who coached the @entity27 winger at @entity28			1
‘ i also know that because of his speed and because of his creativity he is punished a lot with fouls by opponents who can not stop him , ’ the @entity32 boss told @entity33			0
‘ i also know that sometimes he tries to get an advantage and he tries to get a free - kick or he tries to get a penalty			1
‘ i think it ’s important for the players to help the referees by being honest on the pitch , to try to win the right way			2
‘ but the reality is that not every player behaves that way and referees have a difficult job			0
' analyst : @entity28 boss @entity0 is @entity33 's @entity52 ambassador @entity0 added that he thinks video technology is something referees would welcome in the game , to help them make correct decisions when a player might have dived			2
‘ if you have technology you can have a chance to have a fourth official watching on the video or screen situation			0
‘ so i think the referee should also be happy to have the chance in case of doubt , the chance to clear every doubt and the chance to make the right decision			0
@entity73 has clear conscience flying : the @entity27 throws himself into the air after a sliding challenge from @entity78 's @entity77 ‘ when one country feels that one bad decision influences its future in the competition i think it ’s hard and i think it ’s important for coaches , for players and also referees			0
