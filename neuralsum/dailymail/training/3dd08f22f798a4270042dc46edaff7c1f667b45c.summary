by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd for a nation that would usually consider the @entity3 as the competition to decide football 's world champions , the @entity1 have come a long way in terms of the way they view ' soccer '			2
this summer 's @entity12 in @entity13 looks to be the first one that really has @entity1 fans hooked - a whole 20 years on from when they hosted the tournament on their home soil at @entity1 ' 94			1
for once , rather than struggling to drum up support for the @entity20 ( @entity1 men 's @entity21 ) , fans are being turned away from fan parks as @entity1 attempt to drink in the relative successes of their national team on the big stage			1
while that confidence and optimism may have been slightly misguided , the @entity1 are looking good for a place in the last - 16 leaving @entity37 and @entity57 - both considered to be stronger sides - to fail at the group stage			1
a draw against @entity62 in their final group game would guarantee their progress to the knockout stages while a win would see them top the group and set up a potentially favourable tie against likely @entity74 runners - up @entity72 , @entity75 or @entity76			2
and the fans are embracing the success			0
over seven years on from when @entity80 's move to @entity81 heralded a new era - that did n't quite work out - for soccer in the world 's third largest country by population , football , as it is increasingly being referred to , is finally capturing the imagination of the fans			0
even the absence of @entity94 - considered a national hero in soccer terms - has not dampened the enthusiasm			0
celeb support : @entity98 , who counts himself as a @entity100 supporter , was seen geeing up fans at an event here and there : two of the @entity1 's 196,838 ticketholders in @entity13 cheer the team on against @entity37 big moment : @entity109 last minute header sent @entity1 fans - and players - into hysteria dejected : for a nation that calls the sport soccer , fans were hard hit by @entity37 's late eqauliser big story : soccer is now front page news in the states - including their 1 - 1 win over @entity121 in 2010 @entity123 's fan park - laid on for the @entity37 game - has a 15,000 person capacity but had to turn fans away , such was its popularity			1
videos of fans celebrating @entity109 ' last - gasp winner against @entity57 have been doing the rounds on @entity133 and are on a par with videos of @entity137 fans reacting to goals - although they have had less to cheer about this year			2
no country aside from the host nation took up more tickets than the @entity1 's 196,838 for the finals while viewing figures are at an all - time high and beginning to even rival those of @entity1 's traditional sports			1
while the @entity146 still does not quite have the same level of popularity at the @entity20 - it is improving			2
this year 's television viewing figures were low but next year @entity80 will launch his own new @entity151 - based @entity146 side , while @entity152 represents arguably the @entity1 ' biggest coup following his sign for @entity157 's sister club @entity155			1
@entity100 legend @entity158 might follow the @entity160 striker			0
stars : @entity152 is coming to the @entity146 next year and he may yet be joined by @entity100 legend @entity158 @entity162 : @entity80 is launching his own @entity146 franchise after playing for @entity81 late in his career @entity1 ' 94 might have been the best attended @entity12 but with over 20million people watching the game against @entity167 's @entity37 on sunday - this is the @entity12 that is really drawing in @entity1			1
coach @entity168 will face up against his home nation in the final group game - singing both anthems - and maybe the impact of the @entity12 is best summed up by his gesture ahead of the @entity62 game			0
@entity168 has penned a letter for fans to print out and hand in at work to help them get the day off for what he calls ' for an important cause '			0
for supporters in the @entity1 , real football is finally becoming important			0
adopted nation : @entity185 's print - out letter designed to be handed in by @entity1 's at their workplaces top man : @entity190 , the @entity20 's captain is becoming a popular figure in the @entity1 madness : fans in @entity1 gear react to a goal in a @entity197 fanzone - thousands have travelled over @entity1 fans erupted in fan parks and bars when @entity109 scored the winner against @entity57 but despaired when @entity167 set up @entity202 to equalise for @entity37 and deny them qualification after two games			1
a win or draw against @entity62 would guarantee a place in the next round and might see even more emotional scenes .			0

supporters pack out fan parks to cheer on their new heroes
soccer support at an all - time high , 20 years after @entity1 ' 94
@entity1 can beat @entity57 and @entity37 to a last 16 place if they win or draw
@entity146 still struggling but big names are improving the national league
