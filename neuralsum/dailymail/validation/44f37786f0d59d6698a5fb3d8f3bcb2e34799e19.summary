‘ as a sportsman everything you work towards is pulling on your country ’s jersey and representing everyone in the country			0
‘ i went to see the doctor about 8.30 in the morning — i usually get up about 7.30 to 8 — and during that time i was sat in my room thinking should i try the next stage , should i carry on ? i ’ve trained through headaches before so i could definitely have trained on and seen how it went			0
@entity0 is back in training and ready to play against @entity46 at @entity47 on saturday @entity0 is supporting the @entity49 's latest concussion awareness initiative after missing the @entity12 game ‘ but it would n’t have been good preparation for the team or me having that in the back of my mind			1
and obviously there ’s the serious implications of the dangers and the risks involved			0
‘ the way i am , stubborn , desperate to play for my country , i probably would have ( hidden symptoms in the past )			0
but we ’re all aware of it now and the example has been set by the @entity6 medical team and the coaching staff here for everyone else to see			2
