' @entity0 ? heard of it , but remind me ... ' that was always my response to any mention of the place			1
so here 's the answer : @entity0 , as it 's properly known , is a necklace of ten islands in the @entity13 , 350 miles west of @entity14 , off the coast of @entity16			1
it 's a near six - hour flight from the @entity18			2
the sunshine is utterly reliable , as is the breeze from the @entity21			2
surf 's up : the @entity0 island of @entity24 is ( relatively ) well known as a haven for unhurried sunshine holidays the windiest time is november to march , which is bliss for surfers			1
the islands of @entity24 and @entity31 are the big destinations for beach - and - a - book breaks			1
of the hotels on @entity24 , the most comfy and glamorous is the @entity36 in the fishing village of @entity38			1
there 's a 200 - yard walk to miles of glorious beach where boats bob on the turquoise water			1
life here slows down to turtle pace			2
in the evenings you can watch the fishwives gutting their catch on the pier			2
@entity38 is a haven for yachting and water sports			2
the current world champion kite surfer lives here			2
but once you 've bathed in @entity24 's inland version of the @entity57 and visited its superb coast , you may want a bit more			1
@entity60 and lovely : the streets of @entity62 , the capital of @entity64 , are flanked by colourfully painted houses sounds to soothe : music is a big part of @entity0 life			1
the islands have their own musical style , morna there 's plenty of variety in this tiny 39 - year - old republic , a former colony of @entity77 , whose intrepid sailors discovered the islands in the 1450s			1
it 's a 30 - minute flight from @entity24 to the island of @entity64 , where we stayed in @entity62 , a colourful harbour town that , thanks to its @entity77 and @entity18 heritage , looks like @entity87 crossed with @entity88 in @entity89			1
locals all speak @entity91 , a mish - mash of umpteen languages , @entity14 and @entity94			1
' it was designed to fool the @entity77 , ' as one local graduate explained to me			0
@entity62 has fewer tourists , most of them are @entity100			0
they come for the music scene and to worship the late singer @entity102 , ' the barefoot diva '			0
her voice remains the islands ' proudest export and she is revered by @entity107			2
on the edge of town is a peak , @entity111 , well worth the three - hour walk up its switchback road past cactus flowers , wrinkly old men with donkeys and the occasional goat			0
a place of wild wonder : @entity119 , the most westerly island of @entity0 , is a great destination for hikers the view from the top is worth every blister			1
an hour by ferry from @entity64 is the mountainous island of @entity119			1
hike the ribeiras ( river valleys )			0
after the moon - like aridity of @entity24 , they are an emerald paradise			1
i took a local guide — supplied by @entity136 — in a four - wheel drive to the top of a 1,000m - high volcanic peak , then walked down a hairpin trail of wonky basalt cobbles past the cauldron of the vast volcano			0
when the rains come , water bombs down the rocky gullies , washing away cattle and everything else in its path			0
as you slowly descend , cooking smoke and the sounds of a village rise to greet you			0
hens cluck and you walk past tiny children in crocodiles wandering home from school for lunch			0
dragonflies flit over streams flanked by mango trees , papayas , and huge hands of green bananas			0
later , in a straw - roofed cafe , i ate a banana served with local molasses - quite the best pud i 've ever had			0
the old seaside village of @entity173 has a tiny distillery with a donkey - driven mill for crushing sugar cane - a sight that has n't changed in centuries			0
walk me to the beach : colourful boats are a constant presence in an archipelago where fishing is crucial but it 's the people of @entity0 that make it irresistible			1
catholic , strict but loving with their kids , proud of their mixed heritage and all addicted to @entity192 football			0
@entity194 , a born - and - bred barman in @entity62 , tells me that his grandfather had died at 102			0
i clearly did n't look impressed enough			0
' he was very unfit , ' he adds apologetically			0
the @entity196 ( 0845 330 2047 , www.capeverde.co.uk ) offers seven - night island - hopping holidays from £ 1,433 per person or 14 nights from £ 1,755 per person , both including flights			2
a week 's stay at the four - star @entity205 on the island of @entity24 costs from £ 873 pp , based on two sharing a double land view room with bed and breakfast , including return flights and transfers .			1

the @entity0 islands sit some 350 miles west of the @entity14 *mainland*
@entity24 and @entity31 are relatively known , and great for lazy beach holidays
the more westerly island of @entity64 is the archipelago 's *cultural* *hub*
