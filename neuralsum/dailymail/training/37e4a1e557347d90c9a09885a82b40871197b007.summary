@entity1 space scientists have unveiled the asteroid hunting space probe they hope to launch later this year on a mission to mine a celestial body			1
the probe , named @entity7 , is expected to be flung into space in december on a four year voyage to the asteroid @entity10			1
when it gets there , some time in 2018 , it will release a powerful cannon which will fire a metal bullet at the asteroid 's barren crust , once the probe itself has scuttled to safety on the far side of the rock			2
if all goes well , these pristine asteroid samples will be returned to @entity36 by the time @entity37 hosts the @entity38 in 2020			1
at a weekend press conference , @entity39 , project leader at the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) said he and his team were readying to redouble their efforts for this ' new voyage '			0
' i 'm grateful as the new asteroid probe is now nearly complete , ' he said , according to @entity48			0
the probe is the successor to @entity40 's first asteroid explorer , @entity52 - the @entity1 term for falcon - which returned to @entity36 in 2010 with dust samples after a trouble - plagued seven - year mission			1
the spherical @entity10 asteroid , which is around a half a mile ( 1km ) across , contains significantly more organic matter and water than the potato - shaped rock previously studied by the original @entity7			0
once it arrives at the asteroid in 2018 , @entity7 will observe the entire surface of the asteroid using a variety of remote - sensing instruments @entity52 means falcon in @entity1			2
hayabusa 2 is a successor to @entity40 's earlier asteroid explorer @entity7 , which returned the first asteroid samples to @entity36 in june 2010			1
hayabusa 2 is the third mission to land on an asteroid			0
@entity78 's @entity77 mission was the first mission to touchdown on an @entity79 is the second asteroid sample - return mission analysing this valuable cosmic material could shed light on the mysteries surrounding the solar system and its origins 4.6 billion years ago			1
scientists at @entity40 say @entity7 will build on the work of its predecessor , which was only able to collect surface dust samples that could have been altered by years of exposure to various forms of energy encountered in space			1
despite various setbacks during its epic seven - year journey , including intermittent loss of communication and damage to its motors , the first @entity95 was hailed as a triumph of science when it returned to @entity36			2
@entity40 's work guiding the craft back to terra firma made it a source of pride for @entity1 , even inspiring several @entity1 feature films			0
the asteroid is currently scheduled to be blasted in 2018 and the probe will make its back to @entity36 by the end of the decade			2
the data could shed light on how planets form and life arises @entity39 said there were a number of possible complications and pitfalls that could await @entity7			1
' of course , i hope things will go smoothly , ' said mr @entity39			0
' we have had many difficulties in the process of developing the new asteroid probe			0
space is never an easy place , ' he said			0
asteroids are believed to retain materials unchanged from the solar system 's earliest days , unlike scorched remains such as meteorites or materials on @entity36 which have been transformed through pressure and heat			1
the @entity10 asteroid was selected in part because of its make - up and also because of its relative accessibility			0
the space cannon will detach and remotely fire a 4lb metal projectile into the surface of the miniature planet			0

@entity7 will be flung into space on a rocket for a four year voyage
it aims to land on @entity151 sometime in 2018 to collect samples
samples will be returned to @entity36 by time @entity37 hosts @entity38 in 2020
analysing valuable cosmic material from asteroid could shed light on the mysteries surrounding solar system and its origins 4.6 billion years ago
