this incredible patchwork quilt of solar images shows the range of wavelengths that scientists use when investigating our @entity5 the collage made from pictures taken by from @entity10 's @entity9 shows how looking at the @entity5 in different wavelengths highlights various aspects of its surface and atmosphere			1
while taking a photo of the @entity5 with a standard camera will simply show its familiar yellowish , featureless disk , the star actually emits light in all colours			2
scroll down for interactive graphic explaining each colour patchwork : this collage of solar images from @entity10 's @entity9 shows how observations of the sun in different wavelengths highlights different aspects of the sun 's surface and atmosphere			1
the collage also includes images from other @entity9 instruments that display magnetic and @entity37 information so scientists use specialised instruments , either in ground - based telescopes or space - based ones like the @entity9 , to observe light far beyond the limited ranges we can see with the naked eye			1
these different wavelengths convey information about different components of the sun 's surface and atmosphere , so scientists use them to paint a full picture of our constantly changing and varying star			1
scientists describe the wavelengths using units of measurement known as @entity56 , which are equivalent to one ten - billionth of a metre			2
the familiar yellow - green light of 5,500 angstroms , for example , generally emanates from material of about 5,700 degrees c ( 10,000 degrees f ) , which represents the surface of the @entity5 extreme ultraviolet light of 94 angstroms , on the other hand , comes from atoms that are about 6.3million degrees c ( 11million degrees f )			2
that makes it a good wavelength for looking at solar flares , which can reach such searing temperatures			0
by examining pictures of the sun in a variety of wavelengths – as is done through such telescopes as @entity10 's @entity9 , its @entity76 ( @entity76 ) and the @entity77 / @entity78 ( @entity79 ) - scientists can track how particles and heat move through the sun 's atmosphere			1
from the sun 's surface on out , the wavelengths @entity9 observes , measured in @entity56 , are : we see the visible spectrum of light simply because the sun is made up of a hot gas – heat produces light just as it does in an incandescent light bulb			1
but when it comes to the shorter wavelengths , the sun sends out extreme uv light and x-rays because it is filled with many kinds of atoms , each giving off light of a certain wavelength when they reach a certain temperature			2
not only does the sun contain many different atoms – helium , hydrogen , iron , for example - but also different kinds of each atom with different electrical charges , known as ions			0
each ion can emit light at specific wavelengths when it reaches a particular temperature			0
scientists have cataloged which atoms produce which wavelengths since the early 1900s , and the associations are well documented in lists that can take up hundreds of pages			0
solar telescopes make use of this wavelength information in two ways			0
instruments that produce conventional images of the sun focus exclusively on light around one particular wavelength , sometimes not one that is visible to the naked eye			0
@entity9 scientists , for example , chose 10 different wavelengths to observe for its @entity142 ( @entity141 ) instrument			1
each wavelength is largely based on a single , or perhaps two types of ions – though slightly longer and shorter wavelengths produced by other ions are also invariably part of the picture			0
each wavelength was chosen to highlight a particular part of the sun 's atmosphere			1
other kinds of instruments , known as spectrometers , observe many wavelengths of light simultaneously and can measure how much of each wavelength of light is present			0
this helps create a composite understanding of what temperature ranges are exhibited in the material around the sun. but spectrographs do n't look like a typical picture , but instead are graphs that categorise the amount of each kind of light .			0
