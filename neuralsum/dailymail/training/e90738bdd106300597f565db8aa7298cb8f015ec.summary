in these dark days for @entity4 , reminders of past success offer at least some consolation			2
and so it was for @entity6 that , following the latest controversy to engulf @entity8 earlier this week over @entity9 , he took a stroll down memory lane			1
in the corridors of the club ’s training base at @entity16 , pictures festoon the walls of the kids for fame from yesteryear who now serve as inspiration to the next generation			2
staring back are the fresh faces of @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , who all developed at @entity4 from youngsters into multi-million pound @entity31 stars and @entity34 internationals			1
@entity4 boss @entity6 has revealed he would love to play a side made up of youngsters @entity31 right back @entity24 made his name at @entity4 before joining @entity38 in 2008 @entity6 deliberately walked down that corridor after @entity41 chairman @entity40 took aim at @entity8 in the wake of being told to pay £ 204,000 to land out - of - contract @entity9 , who quit @entity4 frustrated at his lack of first - team chances			1
the teen midfielder ’s case , said @entity40 , ‘ highlights the need for parents and young players to choose their clubs very , very carefully ’			1
the @entity8 club ’s youth policy has been a highly contentious issue as they have worked their way through the lower leagues reliant on well - paid , experienced former top - flight performers , while many @entity4 kids have been sent out on loan			2
@entity6 , however , is understandably defensive of his record			1
while the age of that talented quartet — at 29 , @entity25 is the youngest — precludes them from being used as a recent example of success , they at least seem to have a worthy heir in the shape of @entity70			2
under @entity6 , the midfielder has gone from raw teenager in the old @entity73 to full @entity34 call - up at 20			1
he is cited by the @entity4 boss as evidence that if you are good enough , you are old enough under his management			2
‘ that ’s absolutely the case , ’ stressed @entity6			1
‘ @entity70 has come in and done great , while young @entity81 has also come in and done well			2
‘ i think a lot of people would agree with me that it ’s easier for youngsters to break into teams outwith the @entity87			1
i would n’t say the pressure to win is as great at other clubs as it is at the @entity87			1
‘ but we ’ve have had lots of younger boys break into our team in recent years			0
@entity9 joined @entity41 at the beginning of june after failing to break into @entity4 ' first team @entity26 and @entity25 also made their names at @entity4 before moving to @entity98 ‘ in fact , i was just looking at some of the lads who have come through at this club in recent years : @entity26 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity27 — ( and now ) @entity70 and @entity103			1
there ’s been a reasonable few			0
‘ of course , in an ideal world , if i could field 11 players from @entity16 that would be the dream scenario			1
but we all know that ’s not going to happen			0
‘ that does n’t mean that we should n’t be taking the responsibility of producing young talent seriously			0
we always have done that – and that will always be the case			0
’ @entity6 claims he felt @entity9 lacked a bit of physicality and was not quite ready to be a regular starter in the @entity4 first team until this season , although he insists the 19 - year - old left for @entity121 with his best wishes			1
‘ @entity9 was perfectly entitled to turn down our offer , ’ the @entity4 boss continued			0
‘ but i feel he would have got a chance with us this season , absolutely			0
@entity9 is an excellent talent , of that there ca n’t be any doubt			0
but one of the reasons @entity9 did n’t come in at the same time as @entity70 was we felt we had to look after @entity9 a little bit more			0
‘ @entity70 certainly handles the aggressive side of the game a lot better and we just felt , as talented as @entity9 was and is , we had to look after him that little bit more			1
‘ with the greatest of respect , particularly in the last couple of years , the standard of the leagues is as such that the younger ones would have needed protected - particularly in the ( old @entity73 ) ‘ if we ’d fielded a team of youngsters we would n’t have won the league			2
i do n’t care what anyone says , i do n’t think it would have happened			0
‘ that kind of statement is made by people that did n’t know the bottom tier or the standard of opposition , the quality of opposition or the physical prowess of the opposition			2
you have to get a balance			0
‘ but the fact ( we felt @entity9 needed looked after at that level ) should not be to the detriment of how i felt about him or what hopes and aspirations we had for him at the football club			0
‘ and i have to tell you he leaves here with our blessing			0
i say to every youngster that leaves our club - and i genuinely mean it - that i hope they go on and do well in their careers			0
@entity178 is in contention to face @entity180 after missing his side 's last three games ‘ the ones i release i say to them to go out and prove me wrong at another club			1
that 's when one door closes another one opens			0
’ defender @entity178 comes back into the squad for the match at @entity180 as @entity4 try to get the win to move within six points of @entity192 , albeit with a game more played			1
but keeper @entity194 remains in the treatment room along with @entity70			0
despite the importance of the game , @entity6 is looking forward to meeting up beforehand with his old @entity199 team - mate @entity198 , who recently succeeded @entity200 in the dugout at @entity202			1
‘ i ’m not sure i expected @entity198 to become a manager because he was very young when i was at @entity199			0
but everyone was very young when i was at @entity199 , ’ said @entity6 who turned 36 just weeks after leaving @entity8 for @entity203 in 1998			1
‘ he was a very good player and a brilliant lad			0
i hoped he would get the @entity180 job and so did @entity208 and @entity209 , who both know him well , too			1
‘ so far he ’s taking to football management like a fish to water			0
or a duck , or a shark ; a hammerhead ! i look forward to catching up with him on friday			2

@entity6 has insisted the pressure to win games means he can not field a side full of youngsters
he said he would love to field an 11 made up of local players
*rangers* face @entity180 on friday night
