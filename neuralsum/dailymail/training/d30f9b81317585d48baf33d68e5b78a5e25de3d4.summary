by @entity0 published : 20:34 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 04:50 est , 11 december 2013 senior @entity2 mps demanded that the government publish a damning report into the £ 50 billion @entity6 project yesterday after the @entity7 revealed ministers are trying to suppress it			1
conservative vice chairman @entity10 broke ranks and warned that failure to come clean about the project would fuel ‘ growing mistrust about @entity15 ’			1
he spoke out after it emerged that transport secretary @entity17 and cabinet office minister @entity18 have called on @entity19 to veto the release of the report , which found that @entity15 was a ‘ red / amber ’ project in danger of failing , under freedom of information laws			1
@entity10 ( pictured centre ) warned that failure to come clean about the project would fuel ' growing mistrust about @entity15 among the public ' ( file photo ) documents leaked to the @entity7 show that they plan to take the extraordinary step of using a veto usually deployed in cases of national security - because they fear the ‘ political and presentational difficulties at a crucial point in the @entity15 project ’s development ’			1
mr @entity18 and mr @entity17 told the prime minister : ‘ we consider that the importance the government attaches to the successful implementation of the @entity15 project ... justifies the use of the veto in this case			1
’ mr @entity10 , who left the @entity2 whips office at the last reshuffle so he could campaign against @entity15 , told the @entity7 the report , drawn up in november 2011 , should be released in full			1
transport secretary @entity17 ( pictured ) and cabinet office minister @entity18 called on the prime minister to veto the release of the @entity54 ‘ i understand that the study is a little out of date but in my view it is foolish to withhold it , ’ he said			0
‘ it only fuels the growing mistrust of @entity15 among the public			1
‘ i would strongly argue that the report should be released , with a health warning that it is not up to date			2
more recent reports should also be released whether they show a green , an amber or a red light			0
‘ @entity15 legislation has got to the stage in the timetable where it is unstoppable			1
it is like the proverbial runaway train which , if it is not careful , will derail with everyone careering off the track with it			0
’ @entity78 , the mp for @entity79 , said : ‘ i ’m very concerned about this			0
i ’ve been opposed to @entity15 since i came into @entity81			1
i ’ve always thought the business case was weak and i certainly think the fullest possible information should be made public			0
‘ this project will change the landscape of our country , both the topographically and economically and socially			2
an decision should be made with the fullest possible information			0
‘ ministers claim it will usher in a new great age of the railways but it bares no comparison with the @entity97 era since that involved private investors risking their own money and this is the government risking taxpayers ’ money			2
’ @entity104 deputy leader @entity105 described the episode as an example of ‘ shoddy politics ’			0
‘ @entity109 should be published , and it should be published now , ’ he said			0
‘ the fact that we have cabinet ministers seeking to block this report on @entity15 demonstrates the cloak and danger approach the government is taking to this whole project and transparency in general			1
‘ rather than being open , frank and honest about the many potential difficulties that @entity15 is going to face , the government are seeking to bury that bad news			1
’ senior government sources cabinet secretary @entity123 of the @entity124 pointed out that the veto has only previously been used to veto publication of @entity128 discussions on the @entity129 and other matters , to prevent disclosure of prince @entity133 ’s letters to ministers and a @entity136 risk register on @entity138 reforms			2
he said : ‘ this case is interesting because the leaked letter talks not just about the principles of good government , it talks about the veto in terms of political presentation			2
’ he warned that excessive use of the veto would undermine the rule of law			2
‘ vetoing means that ministers do n’t have to argue their case at a tribunal or in court			0
it completely overturns the normal relationship between politicians and the law			0
i ’m sure ministers would like to ignore the law and the courts in all sorts of cases but here they actually can			0
’ sir @entity161 wants publication blocked because it would ‘ create a precedent ’ that would mean further @entity164 would have to be released as well			0
@entity15 , whose £ 50 billion cost includes £ 7.5 billion for the high - speed trains , has a first phase which runs from @entity169 through @entity2 heartlands in the @entity171 to @entity172 which is due for completion in 2026			1
@entity174 , of the @entity175 , said : if @entity15 is going to deliver the vast economic benefits that are claimed for it , there would be no need for ministers to hide behind parliamentary process , they would happily share documents like this			2
