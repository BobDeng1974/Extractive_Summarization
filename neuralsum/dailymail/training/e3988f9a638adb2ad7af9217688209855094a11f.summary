@entity0 has admitted taking his children to @entity2 over a weekend because he did n’t want to wait for a @entity4 appointment			1
the health secretary revealed he had ignored his own department ’s advice that casualty should be used for urgent or life - threatening cases			0
he tried to explain why he had not heeded @entity11 guidance , saying that it is not always clear when emergency care is necessary			0
health secretary @entity0 admitted going to @entity2 instead of his local gp surgery			1
he is pictured with his wife @entity15 and two of their children but @entity20 ’s health spokesman @entity19 accused him of being ‘ irresponsible ’ by suggesting it was acceptable to use @entity2 as a way to bypass busy surgeries			1
mr @entity0 was responding to a point raised in the @entity25 yesterday by @entity27 mp @entity26 that pressure in @entity2 units could be alleviated by @entity30 opening for longer hours			1
he said : ‘ i do agree with you			0
i ’ve taken my own children to an @entity2 department at the weekend precisely because i did n’t want to wait until later on to take them to see a gp			1
i think we have to recognise that society is changing and people do n’t always know whether the care that they need is urgent or whether it is an emergency , and making @entity30 available at weekends will relieve a lot of pressure in @entity2 departments			1
’ he did not say which of his three children he had taken – @entity41 , four , @entity42 , two , or @entity43 , who is just four months – when they went , or why			2
but in an angry exchange with @entity19 on @entity46 later he added : ‘ if parents have an unwell child needing medical attention , @entity2 provides a trusted service			2
’ professor @entity51 who has urged the public to go to pharmacies if they are unwell rather than @entity2 or their gp surgeries mr @entity19 replied : ‘ if all “ unwell ” people went to @entity2 , nhs would collapse			1
surprised you continue to contradict official advice			0
’ he subsequently wrote a letter to the health secretary which said : ‘ your statement in the @entity62 implies that it is acceptable for the public to use @entity2 on an on - demand basis or as a substitute for @entity4 services			1
’ the prime minister ’s official spokesman later said : ‘ i ’m not sure the secretary of state for health was giving advice			0
he was describing a challenge which i think many people up and down the country will recognise in terms of access to @entity30			2
' it ’s perfectly understandable , particularly those with young children , will want to see a doctor as quickly as possible			0
’ earlier this month the @entity11 ’s medical director professor @entity51 urged the public to stay away from @entity2 over concerns that many units are overcrowded			1
the numbers arriving in casualty have soared by 50 per cent in a decade – which has partly been blamed on patients being unable to see a gp			0
meanwhile a damning report by the @entity90 has warned that patients at @entity2 unit in @entity93 , @entity94 are routinely having to wait more than 12 hours			1
the report described the unit as ‘ chaotic ’ and ‘ unsafe ’ and warned that it could be downgraded or closed if urgent changes are not made			0
@entity96 is one of 11 @entity11 trusts to have been placed in special measures last year but unlike the others it has failed to make progress to improve care			0
and in a separate intervention , one of the country ’s most senior doctors said that queues in @entity2 and gp surgeries will only grow unless the government invests more in the @entity11			2
dr @entity110 , chairman of the @entity112 ’s council , said : ‘ the @entity11 is going through its tightest funding squeeze in half a century			0
for patients this means unacceptable waits for treatments … and longer queues in surgeries and @entity2			2

government has urged people not to go to *struggling* @entity2 departments
fears of a *winter* crisis in the coming months as demand *increases*
@entity0 admits taking his children to @entity2 as he ' did *n't* want to wait
