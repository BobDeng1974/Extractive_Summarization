a horse believed to be the oldest in the world has died after reaching the age of 51			1
@entity4 , a liver chestnut @entity6 cross thoroughbred , had been enjoying a comfortable retirement at an @entity9 sanctuary , spending up to five hours a day in the fresh air despite suffering from mild arthritis			1
but last month he was unable to get back up after his legs gave way and staff took the decision to put him down			1
' he was great to own and we are delighted to have had him and we shall miss him dearly			0
' ms @entity21 believes that the elderly gelding 's personality and the fact that his previous owners did not overwork him helped him to live for so long			0
@entity4 had a few grey hairs and mild arthritis , despite his advanced years she said : ' he was such a lovely horse with a great character and he showed how good a horse of this age could look			1
' @entity4 had a few grey hairs around his eyes and in his mane but a high - calorie diet kept him strong and he enjoyed four meals a day			1
his diet included sugar beet and chaff mixed together along with alfalfa nuts , with along cabbage for treats			1
@entity4 , who stood at 15 hands and weighed 480kg , was put to sleep after he collapsed on february 22			1
staff at the @entity51 and @entity52 in @entity53 carried out @entity4 's cremation for free , waiving their usual fee of Â£ 600			1
@entity57 , from @entity51 , said : ' it was an honour to be asked to collect @entity4			2
' we have worked with @entity60 for many years and as a token to @entity21 and her team we offered to cremate him free of charge , a fitting tribute			0
' the @entity60 team , which relies on donations to support its work , is now deciding on a final resting place for the ornate wooden cask carrying @entity4 's ashes			2
last year , when the tale of @entity4 's incredible longevity came to light , ms @entity21 said : ' we get people who rescue a horse and they tell us that it is in its 30s so it knocks them for six when we say we have one in its 50s			1
' the previous title of oldest living horse in the world was held by @entity86 / @entity85 steed @entity83 , from @entity87 , @entity88 , who died aged 51 , in in 2004			2
last year , the @entity91 team said nobody had laid claim to the title since @entity83 's death			0
staff at the sanctuary believed him to be 51 based on the date of birth given by his previous owner , and medical checks			0
veterinary staff try to find out how old a horse is by looking at the condition of a horse 's teeth			2
how long teeth are , how worn they are , and how deep any grooves are , can all give clues as to which birthday should be celebrated			0
@entity113 , a working barge horse , was 62 years old when he died on november 27 1822			2
he was born in @entity115 , @entity116 in 1760 and spent his life pulling barges along canals			0
from paintings , @entity113 is shown to have a brown coat with white blaze and to be similar in size to a shire horse			0
his skull is on display in the @entity127 and his taxidermied head is on display in the @entity130			0
a @entity132 spokesman estimated that @entity4 's years made him the human equivalent of more than 100 , but said that ' the older they get , the harder it is to tell ' once horses get past their average life expectancy of early thirties			2
on average , every horse year beyond the age of four is roughly the same as 2.5 human years			0
using this method , @entity4 would easily be receiving birthday cards from the @entity144 if he were human - at a whopping 120			0
as @entity4 's birth was believed to be before horse passports were introduced , there would only be paperwork detailing the exact date if he were a purebreed			1
but elderly @entity4 fell a little way short of laying claim to being the oldest horse in history			1
that title belongs to ' @entity113 ' who was foaled in @entity115 , @entity116 and had reached the age of 62 when he died in 1822			0
staff at the @entity22 are now deciding what to do with @entity4 's ashes			1

@entity4 , a liver chestnut @entity6 cross thoroughbred , died last month
elderly horse lived on a diet of sugar beet and chaff with cabbage for treats
staff at the @entity170 said he was ' a lovely old boy '
