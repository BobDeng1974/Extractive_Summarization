by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 16:36 est , 24 february 2013 it is feared the house where the @entity4 sisters were born could be turned into a bistro after @entity6 failed to buy it before it was sold			1
members of the @entity9 tried to persuade the authority to buy the four - bedroom terrace in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , so it could be turned into a museum with book shop and cafe			1
but they have now discovered the house has already been sold			2
sold : the house in @entity12 in @entity20 , @entity14 , where the @entity4 sisters were born @entity21 , chairman of the @entity9 , said members were ' upset and very disappointed ' because they had spent months trying to get support for their proposal			1
he said : ' we were hoping to be pushing on with our fund seeking mission with @entity28			0
' it is indicative of our local council that they see history as something to be ignored and local communities left without libraries , pools , or youth facilities			0
' @entity39 's children were all born in the house on @entity12 and baptised in the @entity41 , which the villagers have also been painstakingly restoring			1
historic : it is feared the house where the @entity4 sisters were born could be turned into bistro remembered : a plaque can be found on the outside wall of the house where the @entity50 were born @entity39 once described his years in @entity13 as ' the happiest in his life ' , before the family was torn apart by the premature deaths of its literary prodigies			1
councillor @entity56 begged the council to snap up the property as a cultural asset			0
she said : ' i was extremely disappointed with the council 's response especially the @entity64 department , who said they did not want the @entity4 birthplace			0
' we get lots of tourists from @entity70 and @entity71 and local walkers visiting @entity13 to see the house on @entity12 where the famous sisters were born and to visit the @entity41 where @entity39 preached			1
the @entity50 are one of the most important families in @entity78 literary history			0
sisters @entity79 , @entity81 and @entity82 all began to write at an early age at their home in @entity86 , @entity14			1
their stories started as a game based around brother @entity91 's toy soldiers			0
@entity79 's @entity92 and @entity81 's @entity93 are regarded as classics of @entity78 literature			1
@entity82 's @entity96 remains a huge bestseller			1
@entity81 and @entity82 both died of tuberculosis in 1848 - 9 aged 30 and 29 respectively			1
@entity91 and @entity79 were also killed by the disease			2
their deaths added to the heartbreak of clergyman father @entity39 , who had already lost two younger children to tuberculosis and his wife to cancer			0
' @entity39 said that the five years he spent in @entity13 were some of the happiest of his life			1
' it is very short - sighted of the council when the government has just announced a fund for keeping our history alive			0
' we could have offered a @entity116 beginning with the birthplace and the @entity41 then up to the @entity118 at @entity86 - not just for coach parties but for walkers on the @entity121			0
' there are a lot of disappointed @entity13 residents and associates about this			2
' but councillor @entity13 , @entity6 's executive member for environment , said it was not in a position to buy the house due to @entity111 cuts			1
he said : ' we explored a number of ways in which we might offer assistance for the @entity9 to make an offer for the property			1
' however , as the council is not in a position to acquire the building for itself , we were not satisfied that this was a justifiable use of public money or a reasonable intervention for us to make in competition with any private individual seeking to purchase the property			0
' government cuts to the council 's budget together with a national and local contraction in public grant aid continues to put severe pressure on our existing cultural assets			0
' adding to those pressures with an open ended commitment to an unquantified scheme can not be justified			0
' the house , which has a plaque on the outside wall naming the four @entity4 children who were born there , already attracts fans of the literary siblings			2
literary genius : @entity92 by @entity4 ( left ) and @entity93 by @entity81 ( right ) are two of the greatest works of nineteenth - century @entity78 literature family : @entity96 by @entity167 ( left ) is still popular today			2
@entity39 ( right ) was parson in @entity13 between 1815 and 1820 it is not clear what the buyer of the @entity13 property intends to do with the building but mr @entity21 said he believes it could eventually be turned into a bistro			1
' i understand it 's a local businessman and i think he 's going to turn it into a bistro			0
i do n't know his full plans at the moment , ' he said			0
but mr @entity21 is not giving up yet on the @entity9 's dream			2
' we have decided , as a @entity9 , we are going to carry on with our work and hope that some time in the future it will come on the market			2
' we are going to try and get a professional business plan done and raise money to buy it			0

@entity9 tried to persuade @entity6 to buy property
@entity79 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity192 were born in the house
their father described his years in @entity13 as ' the happiest in his life '
