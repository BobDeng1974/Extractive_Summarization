to date , humanity has landed spacecraft on the moon , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity6 's moon , @entity7 and two asteroids - @entity8 and @entity10			2
but one month from today , a new celestial body will hopefully be added to that list : a comet , namely @entity14			0
@entity15 has today confirmed that the landing attempt of the @entity18 probe on 12 november will go ahead , and engineers will be holding their breath in the run up to the attempt in the hope it is successful			1
@entity15 , headquartered in @entity24 , has confirmed @entity25 will attempt to land on a comet on 12 november			1
the daring descent its @entity18 probe ( artist 's impression shown ) will take seven hours from separation			1
it will be exactly nine years to the day that a similar landing attempt on an asteroid by @entity36 's @entity35 failed in 2005 @entity18 's landing site , currently known as @entity38 and located on the smaller of the comet 's two ' lobes ' , was confirmed following a comprehensive readiness review			1
since the arrival on 6 august 2014 , the mission has been conducting an unprecedented survey and scientific analysis of the comet , a remnant of the early phases of the @entity50 's 4.6 billion - year history			2
at the same time , @entity25 has been moving closer to the comet : starting at 62 miles ( 100km ) on 6 august , it is now just 6.2 miles ( 10km ) from the centre of the body			2
this allowed a more detailed look at the primary and backup landing sites in order to complete a hazard assessment , including a detailed boulder census			0
' now that we know where we are definitely aiming for , we are an important step closer to carrying out this exciting - but high - risk - operation , ' says dr @entity67 , @entity15 's @entity25 mission manager			1
' however , there are still a number of key milestones to complete before we can give the final go for landing			0
' the decision that the mission is ' go ' for @entity38 confirms the timeline of events leading up to the landing			2
@entity25 will release @entity18 at 08:35 gmt / 09:35 cet on 12 november at a distance of approximately 14 miles ( 22.5km ) from the centre of the comet			1
the landing will be about seven hours later at around 15:30 gmt / 16:30 cet			0
during the seven - hour descent , @entity18 will take images and conduct science experiments , sampling the dust , gas and plasma environment close to the comet			1
it will take a ' farewell ' image of the @entity25 orbiter shortly after separation , along with a number of images as it approaches the comet surface			2
it is expected that the first images from this sequence will be received on @entity97 several hours after separation			2
once safely on the surface , @entity18 will take a panorama of its surroundings			0
again , this is expected back on @entity97 several hours later			2
the first sequence of surface science experiments will begin about an hour after touchdown and will last for 64 hours , constrained by the lander 's primary battery lifetime			0
longer - term study of the comet by @entity18 will depend on for how long and how well the batteries are able to recharge , which in turn is related to the amount of dust that settles on its solar panels			2
in any case , it is expected that by march 2015 , as the comet moves closer in its orbit towards the @entity122 , temperatures inside the lander will have reached levels too high to continue operations , and @entity18 's science mission will come to an end			1
the @entity25 orbiter 's mission will continue for much longer			2
it will accompany the comet as it grows in activity until their closest approach to the @entity122 in august 2015 and then as they head back towards the outer @entity50			0
the relatively smooth landing region , identified for the moment simply by the letter ' j ' , is located on the smaller of the duck - shaped comet 's two lobes			1
an inset showing a close up of the landing site is also shown a series of @entity147 decisions must be taken before separation , starting on 11 november with a confirmation from the flight dynamics team that @entity25 is on the right trajectory ahead of delivery of the lander			1
further go / no - go decisions will be made during the night of 11 - 12 november concerning readiness and uplink of commands , culminating in confirmation of the lander 's readiness for separation			1
a short manoeuvre must then take place around two hours before separation			0
this will set @entity25 on course to release @entity18 on the right trajectory to land on the comet			1
the final critical @entity147 for separation occurs shortly after this manoeuvre			0
after the release of @entity18 , @entity25 will manoeuvre up and away from the comet , before reorienting itself in order to establish communications with @entity18			1
' if any of the decisions result in a @entity147 , then we will have to abort and revise the timeline accordingly for another attempt , making sure that @entity25 is in a safe position to try again , ' says dr @entity67			0
close - up of @entity18 ’s primary landing site @entity137 , which is located on the ‘ head ’ of @entity181 – @entity182			2
@entity137 offers the minimum risk to the lander in comparison to the other candidate sites , and is also scientifically interesting , with signs of activity nearby the agency had been quick to select a landing site and prepare for the touch down since @entity25 arrived in orbit around the comet on 6 august 2014			1
this is because they want to attempt the landing before the comet gets closer to the sun and becomes more active			0
when this happens it is thought it will release more water vapour , which may be hazardous to the lander ’s health			0
the landing itself even without this hazardous water vapour will be incredibly tense , as such an endeavour has never been successfully completed before			0
the closest comparison is the attempting landing on an asteroid of a probe called @entity35 attached to @entity36 ’s @entity35 spacecraft on 12 november 2005			1
however , in that instance the lander was released at too great a height - and it floated off into space instead of drifting towards the asteroid			0
mission operators for the @entity25 mission will be hoping such a fate does not befall the @entity18 lander			1
nonetheless , @entity25 will still be continuing to study the comet into the future regardless of the outcome of the landing attempt			1
it will use its 11 scientific instruments to study the comet as it orbits the sun. the agency had been quick to select a landing site and prepare for the touch down since @entity25 arrived in orbit around the comet on 6 august 2014			2
this is because they want to attempt the landing before the comet gets closer to the sun and becomes more active ( jets of vapour shown shooting into space here ) the high - risk manoeuvre , if successful , will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet			1
scientists at mission control in @entity250 hope the spider - like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of @entity97 's water and perhaps even life			1
but they 've warned that the landing should be seen as an ' exciting extra ' on the @entity25 as the mission carries a ' high risk '			1
@entity261 is currently travelling through space some 297 million miles ( 478 million km ) from @entity97			0
the relatively smooth landing region , identified for the moment simply by the letter ' j ' , is located on the smaller of the duck - shaped comet 's two lobes			1
a further back up site has been chosen on the larger of @entity272 's lobes , and is currently being marked by @entity15 with the letter ' c '			0
' as we have seen from recent close - up images , the comet is a beautiful but dramatic world - it is scientifically exciting , but its shape makes it operationally challenging , ' dr @entity274 , @entity275 , said earlier this month			0
' none of the candidate landing sites met all of the operational criteria at the 100 per cent level , but @entity38 is clearly the best solution			0
' @entity25 took an incredible selfie of its 131ft ( 40 metre ) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week			0
in the background is the duck - shaped comet , @entity261 , with its distinct ' head ' and ' body ' clearly visible at @entity137 , the majority of slopes have an angle less than 30º , reducing the chances of @entity18 toppling over during touchdown			0
@entity38 also appears to have relatively few boulders , and receives sufficient daily sunlight to recharge @entity18 and continue science operations on the surface beyond the initial battery - powered phase			1
@entity307 was chosen as a backup because of more sunlight hours and fewer boulders			0
but even the flat surface chosen contains potentially dangerous boulders and cracks			0
these include a mysterious ' pyramid ' , in the words of @entity15 , named cheops that was spotted on the surface of the comet earlier this week			0
at around 82ft - tall ( 25 metres ) , the structure is one of the larger boulders seen on the comet and could help scientists better understand its history			0
@entity326 , taken by @entity25 's @entity328 camera on 19 september , from a distance of 17.7 miles ( 28.5km ) the ' pyramid ' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of @entity335 's larger lobe - an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at @entity339 near @entity340 in @entity341			1

@entity15 has confirmed @entity25 will attempt to land on a comet on 12 november
the daring descent of its @entity18 probe will take seven hours from separation
it will be exactly nine years to the day that a similar landing attempt on an asteroid by @entity36 's @entity35 spacecraft failed in 2005
the region , named @entity38 , is around *2.4* miles ( *4km* ) at its widest point
however @entity15 says the @entity18 mission is still ' high - risk ' and should be seen as a bonus to the overall @entity25 mission
scientists hope the spider - like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of @entity97 's water and perhaps even life
