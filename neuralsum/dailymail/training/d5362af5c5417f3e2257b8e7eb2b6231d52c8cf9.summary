by @entity0 if you ’re hoping for the halcyon days of gaming to be given a virtual reality reboot , look no further than @entity4			1
the headset , which continues to seemingly lead the way in the fight for the emerging vr market , has been used to take a fresh look at @entity10			2
and now , in this rather stomach - churning video , you can experience all the loops , jumps and speed of @entity10 in glorious first - person			1
in the game the player can look around in the virtual world using the headset while moving with a controller , with the experience likened to riding a rollercoaster the game uses something known as @entity33			1
this is a collection of source code that makes it possible for fan - created @entity10 games to be designed			1
the ones in this video were made using the @entity42 3			0
‘ this is one of those games where if you kind of get woozy on those rollercoasters in theme parks i recommend you probably stay away from this one , ’ @entity19 user @entity17 said in his video			0
‘ but besides that it ’s extremely fun			0
’ in the video , the gamer is shown using the headset to ‘ look around ’ as they play			0
this enables them to move towards obstacles , loops and jumps while using a controller to input commands			2
@entity10 is known for his speed and quick movements , as well as his iconic look			2
using the @entity4 will therefore give gamers the opportunity to see life through the eyes of @entity71 ’s mascot			1
the game uses something known as @entity33			0
this is a collection of source code that makes it possible for fan - created @entity10 games to be designed			1
the ones in the video ( screen grab pictured ) were made using the @entity42 3 creator @entity17 says those who feel a bit woozy on rollercoasters might not enjoy the experience too much			0
here @entity10 begins a roll into a ball before diving down a hill in a particular butterflies - in - the - stomach moment @entity95 's virtual world was given the go ahead earlier this year when their $ 2bn ( £ 1.2bn ) deal to buy @entity99 headset firm @entity96 was approved			1
@entity96 was founded by 21 - year - old college dropout @entity4			1
the firm is developing the leading vr headset - with a developer version on sale for $ 350 ( £ 210 ) it will first be used for immersive games , but @entity95 ceo @entity107 promised the headset will ' change the way we work , play and communicate			0
' but virtual worlds could include advertising admitted @entity107 the purchase of @entity96 put @entity95 in a battle with @entity115 , who have already unveiled their own version of a @entity99 headset , destined for the @entity119 next year			2
the video is just one of a number of innovative ways @entity96 has been employed			0
@entity125 broadband provider @entity124 recently unveiled its intriguing experiment			2
they programmed the headset to experience internet lag in real life , to give users an idea of what it would be like to live in a world where things buffer like an online video			1
the experiment is called ' living with lag ' and sees four volunteers going through activities while using an @entity4 together with a @entity142 , webcam and noise - cancelling headphones			1
together , this combination can simulate different levels of lag , from a brief 0.33 seconds to a more frustrating three seconds			0
the results are rather hilariously shown in their video , which includes the volunteers struggling to dance and play table tennis .			0

a gamer has used the @entity4 to create a first - person @entity10 game
using the @entity99 device , gamers can see through the eyes of @entity71 's mascot
they can then run and jump across loops and levels with a controller
the experience is compared to riding a rollercoaster at a theme park
it is just one innovative use for *upcoming* virtual reality *technology*
a @entity125 *company* , for example , lets users experience ' lag in real life '
