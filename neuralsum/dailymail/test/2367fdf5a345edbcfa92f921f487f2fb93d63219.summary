a clock based on a design from 300 years ago has stunned experts by keeping accurate to a second for 100 days			1
the modern - day @entity4 is based on @entity7 's 18th century clock , which he thought up to solve the problem of determining longitude at sea			1
it has been part of a 100 - day trial at the @entity13 , in @entity14 , to see if the claim - that the clock would neither lose nor gain more than a second in 100 days - was true			1
the @entity4 ( left ) , which is based on a design by carpenter @entity7 ( right ) from 300 years ago , has stunned experts by keeping accurate to a second for 100 days the clock , which was built using modern materials , was initially set ticking a year ago after being strapped to one of the @entity13 's supporting pillars			1
but it quickly became apparent the trial would be a success and wax seals were placed on its case so its accuracy could be verified , the @entity25 on sunday reported			0
the time was measured using a radio - controlled clock , which received the national time signal , and the @entity34 speaking clock			1
@entity36 , a member of the @entity37 , said : ' as soon as we set the clock running it was clear that it was performing incredibly well , so then we got the case sealed because nobody was going to believe how well the clock was running			0
' he added that the clock was not a replica of @entity7 's , but used his design and concept			1
' it is important to realise his design goes against everything the establishment has claimed is the best throughout history , ' mr @entity36 added			0
the modern - day clock has since been certified by the @entity57 , which the @entity58 confirmed on @entity59 the @entity61 clock has been part of a 100 - day trial at the @entity13 ( above ) , in @entity14 , to see if the claim - that the clock would neither lose nor gain more than a second in 100 days - was true the clock has since been certified by the @entity57			1
when it was measured it was reading @entity69 time to within a quarter of a second			0
the @entity58 confirmed the record on @entity59 yesterday			2
it wrote : ' our 100 day trail of " @entity4 " won @ @entity57 for " most accurate mechanical clock with a pendulum swinging in free air " ! ' @entity77 , the @entity13 ’s curator of horology , added : ‘ what we ’ve seen here is something approaching a perfect clock , but we are not there yet			1
’ @entity7 died in 1776			2
he has since been the subject of @entity86 's bestselling book @entity87 , as well as a film with the same name starring @entity90 ( right ) and @entity91 ( left ) @entity7 was a carpenter born in 1693 in @entity92			1
in the early 18th century a lot of @entity95 ships were being lost at sea			1
although latitude was relatively easy to determine using the sun , longitude was harder			0
the problem was considered so important @entity101 offered financial rewards of up to £ 20,000 to anyone who solved it			0
@entity105 argued that a heavy pendulum bob and short swing would be the best			0
but @entity7 dismissed this theory and thought a clock with a lighter pendulum bob and wide swing would work better			2
he designed his first clock in 1713 aged 20			0
his ' longitude ' clock , which was the basis of the @entity115 , would solve the problem of determining longitude at sea , he claimed			2
by knowing the amount of time the ship had been at sea and the local time by using the sun , sailors would be able to determine longitude accurately			0
local time is one hour ahead for every 15 degrees of longitude east and one hour behind for every 15 degrees of longitude west			0
he was not taken seriously by any of his contemporaries and the possibilities of his clock were not explored until the 20th century			2
he has since been the subject of @entity86 's bestselling book @entity87 , as well as a film with the same name starring @entity90 and @entity91 .			0
