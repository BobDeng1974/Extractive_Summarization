@entity1 is expected to abolish tax on pension payments which are passed to spouses when their partner dies , it emerged last night			1
widows could receive a huge boost if the @entity8 announces changes to annuities in the @entity11 next week			1
at the moment , a surviving partner pays tax on income payments which they receive from a joint life annuity			1
@entity1 ( pictured ) is expected to abolish tax on pension payments which are passed to spouses when their partner dies this can swallow up to half of the original income their partner received before they died			1
but mr @entity1 is now expected to announce that these payments will be tax - free in the future if a spouse dies under the age of 75			1
the chancellor has already cut death taxes for people who do not turn their pension pots into annuities – placing those who did take out an annuity at a tax disadvantage			2
the latest change would level the playing field for those who want the security of guaranteed income but do not want their partner to be penalised for doing so after their death			1
sales of annuities have plummeted since mr @entity1 announced new pension freedoms in the budget which meant ‘ no one will have to buy an annuity ’			2
but when he announced further changes to death duties on pension pots , it made annuities look even less favourable and alternatives more appealing			0
critics said it had gone too far and now discouraged annuities , including joint life policies which ensure part of the income is passed on after death			2
the new changes , if announced next week , would make these kind of annuities attractive once again			0
@entity59 , of @entity60 ( pictured ) said the move would be ' fair ' to annuity customers it is understood there may be no tax to pay on the annuity payment where death occurred before the age of 75 , bringing it in line with tax breaks being introduced on income drawdown schemes			1
for deaths after age 75 , a dependant ’s pension would be taxed as income , which again would bring it in line with other drawdown options			1
drawdown allows customers to leave their pension fund invested while still taking an income from it , and will be available to millions more people over 55 as a result of the new pension reforms			0
speaking of the anticipated changes to joint annuities , @entity59 , of @entity60 , said : ‘ this would be a fair move for annuity customers and shows the government recognises that annuities can still play an important part of a customer ’s retirement strategy after april			0
‘ while people may well want to use the new flexibility offered , many will also want a level of certainty and security provided by an annuity to cover at least their basic needs			0
’ pensions expert @entity106 , of @entity107 , said last night : ‘ it is a logical harmonisation of the tax treatment			0
‘ a lot of the pensions industry was perplexed why the government had chosen to weight the death benefits tax away from guaranteed incomes in favour of riskier outcomes			2
‘ it is good that they have listened to the industry			0
’ dr @entity120 , a pensions expert and economist , said such a change would be ‘ relatively inexpensive ’ for the taxpayer .			0
