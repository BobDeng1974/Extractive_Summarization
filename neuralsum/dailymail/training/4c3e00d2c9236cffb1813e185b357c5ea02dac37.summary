@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 and @entity6 fixtures			2
@entity8 ’s problems keeping the ball at @entity10 began from the back where goalkeeper @entity12 , who normally likes to roll the ball out to a defender to start play , was forced to kick it long			2
he launched all but two of 33 passes into @entity20 ’s half – so not surprising that barely a third of them reached another @entity8 player			1
it set an uncharacteristic tone for the @entity25			2
their total of just 36.5 per cent possession was the lowest total recorded by an @entity30 side in a @entity5 game since records began in 2003			2
@entity12 contributed to @entity8 's poor possession record against @entity20 at @entity10 2			1
nobody works harder for a team than @entity36 , even when he is asked to play out of position			1
the @entity39 midfielder responded to @entity41 ’s request to play at centre forward by making more sprints ( 71 ) than any other @entity45 player , and covering more miles ( 6.7 ) in his 82 minutes than all but @entity48 managed in 90			1
for good measure he set up @entity50 for the third goal and made two other chances in the 3 - 0 win over @entity54			2
@entity45 midfielder @entity36 put in a shift up - front against @entity54 on saturday 3			1
@entity58 goalkeeper @entity57 has added a confidence coming off his line to his shot - stopping			1
the @entity63 international made eight saves to help end @entity67 ’s six - game winning run , but it was his willingness to catch crosses that made the biggest contribution as ten - man @entity58 held on to a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity57 used his 6ft 4ins frame to come out and make six catches in all – more than any other @entity5 keeper this weekend			1
@entity58 goalkeeper @entity57 makes one of eight saves in his side 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity67 4			1
will @entity80 showed his determination to force his way back into @entity84 ’s starting team with a match turning nine minutes after coming on for @entity86 at @entity87			1
the 25 - year - old , who followed @entity84 from @entity89 in the summer for just £ 2.5million , sprinted the length of the field to set up @entity93 ’s dramatic winner seconds after heading away a corner on his own six yard box			2
he ran a remarkable 1.5 miles during his brief time on the pitch – and set up three other chances as well as the winning goal			2
@entity86 midfielder @entity80 ( right ) wins the ball from @entity87 's @entity101 at @entity102 5			1
@entity103 can be a gambler if he ’s chasing a game – he used all three subs at the same time with nearly half an hour left shortly after @entity107 had scored @entity109 ’s second goal			2
it ’s the second time since bringing @entity111 into the @entity5 that he ’s risked leaving himself with ten men if anybody gets injured			0
he did the same thing when his side were 2 - 0 down with 22 minutes to go at @entity117 in october			0
sadly for @entity103 his boldness failed to change the game both times			0
on each occasion the @entity121 went on to lose 2 - 0			0
@entity111 boss @entity103 made all three of his substitutions with almost 30 minutes left against @entity109 6			2
@entity125 ’s return from the abdominal injury that had kept him out since early march has added an extra attacking threat to @entity129 ’s back four			1
the 24 - year - old @entity39 full back played more accurate passes in @entity133 ’s half than any other @entity129 defender in the 2 - 1 win over @entity133 as @entity137 ’s side stretched their recent run to 16 points from eight games			1
@entity125 has recovered his pace since undergoing surgery , too			1
he recorded the quickest average speed of any @entity129 player			1
fit - again @entity125 was @entity129 's quickest player in their 2 - 1 win against @entity133 at @entity146 7			1
@entity117 ’s @entity147 is still a relative rookie after less than a year as a @entity5 boss but he ’s not afraid to take big decisions			0
he made seven changes to the team that had unluckily lost to @entity129 a week earlier – including dropping top scorer @entity152 – for the trip to @entity154 and was rewarded with a 1 - 0 win			1
it ’s fair to assume the @entity158 international will be back on @entity159 , though			0
his one shot on target in a 14 minute cameo as a sub was more than @entity165 @entity164 managed in the previous 76 minutes			0
@entity166 delighted by showing despite personnel change @entity117 boss @entity147 decided to start top - scorer @entity168 on the bench against @entity154 8			0
one of the first priorities on @entity172 ’s list when he returned to @entity173 two years ago was to persuade @entity174 to sign a new contract			0
the talented winger had previously turned down new deals insisting he wanted to play in a higher division			0
with just 18 months left on that agreement , it might be worth @entity172 talking to the 27 - year - old again to tie him down a bit longer			0
@entity174 has now hit six goals in the last nine games for the top of the @entity187 side			0
@entity173 midfielder @entity174 ( right ) squeezes the ball past @entity190 goalkeeper @entity189 9			0
@entity192 ’s status as a former @entity39 boss is n’t keeping too many critics off his back as @entity197 battle at the lower end of @entity199			0
the 61 - year - old suffered abuse from @entity202 fans as his team clawed their way back from two down at home to @entity206 only to lose to @entity208 ’s volley			0
it seemed tough on @entity192 – his team had been unbeaten in six matches before saturday			0
@entity197 manager @entity192 is under pressure after a defeat by @entity206 at home 10			0
@entity214 might need to spend pretty quickly some of the £ 250,000 plus bounty that a glamour @entity216 tie with @entity67 will bring them			1
four days after their efforts to win a replay with @entity221 that secured the bonanza tv tie , @entity218 ’s side lost 1 - 0 at home to relegation rivals @entity224			0
and with a boxing day trip to @entity199 leaders @entity226 followed by another six - pointer against @entity229 , they could find themselves bottom of the table by the time @entity233 and co turn up at @entity235 on january 4th .			0

@entity58 's @entity57 made eight saves against @entity67
