by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor it is obviously the week for @entity4 's colourful politicians to come clean about their ambitions			0
first @entity6 revealed he will stand for election as an mp next year , after years of prevarication			1
now it seems @entity12 leader @entity11 is about to take the plunge and name the @entity15 seat of @entity16 as his target to get a foothold in the @entity19			1
@entity12 leader @entity11 is the frontrunner to be the party 's candidate in @entity16 , it emerged today the @entity12 association in the seat could confirm mr @entity11 as its candidate as early as this weekend , the @entity23 reported			1
he is said to be on a shortlist of two or three candidates to be chosen by local activists			2
last month an opinion poll by @entity31 named @entity16 as one of just two seats where @entity12 is already in the lead			2
it put @entity12 on 33 per cent , ahead of @entity36 and the @entity37 tied on 29 per cent and the @entity38 trailled 4 per cent			1
@entity39 , the local party secretary , told the ft : ' it is the worst - kept secret in town			1
' we now have two names on the list and one of them is mr @entity11			2
whether he will get selected or not is another matter ... although i 'd be surprised if he does n't			0
' the seat is considered vulnerable after sitting @entity37 mp @entity50 announced she would stand down in 2015 , after being an mp for only five years			1
a @entity12 spokesman said : ' the branch are starting to receive nominations from people interested in standing , but there 's no shortlist of candidates yet			1
' even when there is a shortlist of candidates finalised for hustings , that list will be kept confidential			2
we are still a long way off announcing a candidate for @entity16			0
' mr @entity11 stood in the in 2005 but came a distance fourth			2
since then he has seen a surge in support for his party , culminating in coming first in the @entity72 elections in may			0
mr @entity11 hopes to build on the electoral success of the party in the last two years , including winning the @entity76 @entity72 elections in may last month an opinion poll by @entity31 showed @entity16 top be one of just two seats where @entity12 was already ahead mr @entity11 tried unsuccessfully to become an mp in 2010 , standing against commons speaker @entity81 in @entity82			1
but he was defeated , after suffering serious injuries when a light aircraft he was flying in crashed on polling day			0
since then there have been several by - elections in which @entity12 has been tipped to perform well , but mr @entity11 ducked the chance to stand in			1
after dodging @entity89 and @entity90 , he had been expected to the throw his hat into the ring for @entity93			0
after mulling the idea for some time , mr @entity11 was accused of ' bottling it ' after deciding not to stand himself			2
the news that mr @entity11 has selected a seat comes after @entity98 mayor mr @entity6 ended years of speculation and finally confirmed he will also make a bid for @entity72 in 2015			1
@entity6 finally confirmed this week that he would also be standing for election in 2015 , and is hunting for a seat speaking at @entity103 in @entity98 on wednesday , mr @entity6 said : ' i have danced around it for an awfully long time			0
the @entity106 said ages ago that he would welcome me back			0
' it is also been pretty clear i can not endlessly go on dodging these questions as i have tried to do			0
' let me put it this way			0
i have n't got any seat lined up yet			0
but i do think that in all probability , since you can not do these things furtively , in all probability i will try to find somewhere to stand in 2015			0
' he is yet to find a seat , but is widely expected to opt for @entity119 where the @entity37 have a majority of 11,216 and sitting mp sir @entity121 is standing down .			1

@entity12 leader is said to be on the candidates list for key target seat in @entity15
move will end months of speculation about where @entity11 will stand
local party secretary says : ' it is the worst - kept secret in town '
seat is held by @entity37 mp @entity50 who is standing down after five years
