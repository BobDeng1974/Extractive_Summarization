by @entity0 a family has been torn apart after a woman agreed to have a baby for her own mother and then backed out of the surrogacy arrangement while pregnant			1
@entity6 originally made the extraordinary offer after her mother @entity8 miscarried the @entity10 baby she was expecting with her new husband at 21 weeks			1
it was while leaving hospital that miss @entity6 told her mother : ‘ if you want to try again i ’ll help you			1
i ’ll be a surrogate for you if you want me to			0
’ @entity6 , with baby @entity17 , who is 18 months			1
ms @entity6 gave birth @entity17 after carrying the baby as a surrogate for her mother @entity8 she became pregnant at the first attempt using sperm from her stepfather @entity23 – and gave her 50 - year - old mother the news in a gift box with a card			1
mrs @entity8 was thrilled but her delight turned to dismay after the 26 - year - old had second thoughts following a scan at mid-pregnancy			1
miss @entity34 , a single mother who has a four - year - old son from a previous relationship , consulted a solicitor and as the surrogacy agreement was never legally formalised she was free to back out and did so by sending a letter to her mother			1
she said : ‘ what it came down to was that the bond with my baby was stronger than the bond with my mum			0
’ the baby , @entity17 , was born in november 2012 weighing a healthy 8lb 11oz			0
initially mother - of - four mrs @entity8 and her husband , 50 , visited the baby they hoped would be with them			1
mrs @entity8 said she was desperate for a sibling for her seven - year - old daughter – the youngest of her four girls			1
but emotions became so strong that the relationship between mother and daughter broke down completely			2
mrs @entity8 is alleged to have texted a mutual friend : ‘ tell her she is dead to me			2
’ @entity6 , right , with her mother @entity61 , left			2
@entity6 's decision to keep the baby she was carrying for her mother has caused a bitter family feud @entity17 is now 18 months old and the saga has taken another twist with miss @entity34 pursuing care worker mr @entity23 for maintenance through the @entity68			1
miss @entity6 said : ‘ i have my daughter ’s best interests at heart and i have to make sure she is being properly looked after			0
’ yesterday mrs @entity8 , a cleaner , refused to speak in detail , but said : ‘ she does n’t want anything to do with us			0
she does n’t let us see the children			0
’ mrs @entity8 had no direct genetic connection to the baby as her egg was not used in a diy process carried out at home			2
miss @entity34 , of @entity82 , @entity83 , appears to have infuriated her mother even further by going public and selling her story to a newspaper			2
she told @entity86 : ‘ this has caused a split between myself and my mum that can never be healed			0
‘ but every time i look at my beautiful little girl and feel that surge of love for her i know i made the right decision			0
’ she said of the offer she made to her mother : ‘ it was a spur of the moment offer made at a time of high emotion			0
but i meant it , i really wanted to help them			0
’ however , in time she began to bond with the unborn child and concluded that she ‘ just could n’t hand over my baby to mum ’ .			0
