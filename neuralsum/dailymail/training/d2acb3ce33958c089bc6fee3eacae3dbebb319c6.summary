no matter how hard the likes of @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 try to boost the quality of their handsets ’ sound , they are still lacking			0
the @entity9 case offers a solution by promising to double the volume on the @entity12 and @entity13 without the use of cables , batteries or speakers			1
instead , the case ’s interior is carved with a horn - shaped waveguide that directs sound from the speakers on bottom up to a grill on the side			1
it also has ' military - grade ' protection , and adds 0.28 - inch ( 7mm ) depth to the phone a 17 - year - old student recently created a similar case that not only mounts an @entity12 securely to the handlebars of any bike , it doubles up a speaker			1
the @entity43 case lets cyclists listen to music , make calls and use navigation apps completely hands - free , and without obstructing their hearing with earbuds			2
@entity43 is powered by two aaa batteries and has an output of up to 90 decibels - the same sound as a train horn , for example , and louder than city traffic			1
this means navigational instructions and voice calls will be audible above road noises			0
this horn - shape does make the @entity62 thicker than standard cases , but @entity64 claims it only adds 0.28 - inch ( 7mm ) depth			1
the case , from @entity67 - based @entity64 , may not be able to improve the quality of the music , but by doubling the output without increasing the volume on the device , it means the sound is less tinny			1
the case also does n’t use any extra battery life			2
in addition to amplifying sounds , the @entity9 includes a dual layer shell with a rubberised interior			2
this is designed to absorb impacts if the phone is dropped , and a raised bezel protects the screen			0
according to @entity64 , the sound power has been tested to acoustic sound quality standards , while the shell meets military protection standards			0
however , all these features come at a price and the @entity9 costs £ 44.95 in the @entity91 and $ 44.95 in the @entity92 , plus a £ 4.95 / $ 4.95 delivery charge			2
alternatively , the case is available from @entity95 in black , blue and pink			0
