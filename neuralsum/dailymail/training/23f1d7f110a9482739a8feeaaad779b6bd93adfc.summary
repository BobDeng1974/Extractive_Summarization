by @entity0 thinking of a spot of spring cleaning this weekend ? always dreamed of a cleaning method that will kill 99 per cent of germs without the use of a single chemical ? and one which will require minimal elbow grease , and be suitable for ­ everything from floors and carpets to windows , sofas , taps , tiles — even defrosting your freezer ? if so , steam cleaning is for you			1
all of a sudden it ’s got the country hot and bothered , with @entity21 reporting sales of steam cleaning devices rocketing by 94 per cent over the last year			1
sales of steam cleaners at @entity21 have increased by 94 per cent in the past year whereas cloths and sprays often remove dirt only from surfaces , high - pressure steam can penetrate deeper into nooks and crannies , blasting away stubborn particles and killing everything from bacteria to mould , with nothing more than tap water			1
it does n’t leave chemicals behind , binds with dust to stop it escaping into the air and , most importantly , decimates dust mites			1
most even claim to clean @entity45 sofas			1
it all sounds too good to be true , so is there a catch ? critics complain it can take up to six minutes for the water to become steam and many steamers have a high ‘ faff factor ’ , with complicated buttons , scant instructions and lots of bewildering attachments			1
then there ’s the fact that you still need to wipe up afterwards to remove dislodged dirt and excess water			1
so , is this the new golden age of steam , or just a load of hot air ? @entity68 put eight of the best - selling models to the test			1
@entity0 tries out the latest models of steam cleaners to hit the market @entity76 , fast and @entity75 , £ 59.99 , hoover.co.uk this ‘ seriously powerful ’ handheld steamer weighs just over 1lb			1
it claims to have one of the fastest heat - up times going and a tool for every conceivable @entity83 says : wielding this in my bathroom like some kind of sci - fi stun gun was fun			2
the sensible curved design protected my hand from the steam , which is controlled by a slider switch on the handle			1
it ’s fairly idiot - proof — for most tasks just waft the steamer over the area you want to clean			2
it ’s quick to fill , and took just under 20 seconds to start steaming			2
the long cord also made moving around the room easy			2
perfect for nooks and crannies , it made my loo shine , had a good bash at the limescale around the taps ( no steamer removed it completely ) and the brush attachment made my grouting look like new			2
the downsides ? it fared less well with a greasy oven top and , on the maximum setting , it produces a lot of excess water			2
verdict : great for tricky little jobs , particularly in the bathroom.4 / 5 @entity0 tries out one of the cleaning models in the bathroom @entity123 , £ 79.99 , @entity124 , this ‘ stylish ’ steam mop converts to a handheld model in seconds and comes in red , green or @entity129 says : do n’t be alarmed by the number of pieces when you open the box — the clear instructions include advice on which attachment to use for different tasks , from cleaning grouting to steaming clothes			1
it ’s lightweight and simple to use , heating up in 15 seconds			2
the tank is easy to fill , and there ’s just one on / off switch and a dial to control the amount of steam produced			1
it removed plenty of dirt from my kitchen floor , and the handle and mop head detached with one click to turn it into a handheld steamer			2
it got rid of scum from grouting with minimum effort , and left my windows streak - free thanks to a handy cloth that attaches to the squeegee			2
my favourite of those i tried.verdict : easy to use , quick to heat up and tackles a range of jobs			2
5/5 whereas cloths and sprays often remove dirt only from surfaces , high - pressure steam can penetrate deeper into nooks and crannies quick and @entity176 , £ 34.95 , @entity177 in minutes , this compact handheld is designed for surfaces that need regular refreshing and claims to reach the trickiest @entity179 says : unlike some steamers , you do n’t have to worry about where to put this down if the phone rings			1
a sensible kettle - like shape , it sits happily on your work surface			2
just as well , really , as it took nearly three minutes to get up to steam			1
once full of water , it ’s fairly heavy and the cord is shorter than most			2
the lid to the tank was robust but difficult to unscrew ; i had to wait over an hour — i assume until it had cooled — to be able to open it and empty the water afterwards			0
the steamer comes with lots of tools , but minimal instructions ; still , it ’s useful for little jobs such as sterilising children ’s toys , and the spatula attachment was the best i tested at removing grease from my hob			0
verdict : simple design but heavy and not particularly versatile			0
2/5 for non-stop @entity212 , £ 349.99 , @entity213 of steamers , this vacuum - style model has two tanks for non-stop floor cleaning , while the hose turns into a handheld @entity218 says : looking like a squat yellow ladybird , this fancy steamer needs a decent amount of cupboard space			0
the manual looks like @entity224 , but that ’s mainly because it has a section for almost every language on @entity228			0
more diagrams and tips would have helped , although one gem about pouring vinegar on limescale before steaming was ingenious			0
the large , easy - to - fill tank took about three minutes to heat up , and while it was n’t very quiet , it was incredibly powerful — even with the dial only turned up halfway			0
the mop attachment made light work of my kitchen floor			0
once finished , i simply unclipped it and used the hose and gun to blitz areas like my sink and the inside of a pedal bin ( where chemical cleaners had failed )			1
i ’d have liked some smaller brushes for things such as grouting , but otherwise it ’s impressive			0
verdict : large but powerful , for those serious about steaming			0
3/5 the models are said to kill 99 per cent of germs without the use of a single chemical for retro good @entity259 , £ 79.99 , @entity261 retro - style cylinder steamer promises to be powerful yet compact , with accessories for more than 25 cleaning tasks stored on @entity264 says : this clever gadget has all the tools you need — from brushes to a wire scrubber for barbecue grills — inside the base , meaning there ’s no need to root around in the cupboard			1
a funky red design , it ’s made to sit on the floor , but it ’s not too heavy and has just an @entity279 - sized footprint			0
there ’s a long hose and while the steam gun looks basic , it delivers a powerful blast and has a handy lock to keep steam in when not in use			1
it cleaned floors thoroughly , and was good at smaller jobs , too , such as polishing work surfaces and refreshing sofas			0
it heated up in around three minutes ( quicker than the five stated on the box ) , and my only gripes are the difficult - to - read steam control knob and the slightly faffy lid to the water tank			1
verdict : good - looking , versatile , and great value for the price			0
3/5 @entity302 , £ 74.99 , @entity303 to refresh carpets and leave hard floors sparkling , the pulsating floor head claims to agitate ground - in dirt for a deeper @entity307 says : of all the steamers i tried , this was the quickest to assemble and fill , thanks to the removable tank			0
it stands up on its own when not in use , has an anti-limescale cartridge for hard water , and a fold - down handle for easy storage			0
the cord is n’t as long as some models , but the buttons were easy to understand , and it heated up in 30 seconds			1
it ’s not light and took a bit of effort to mop my kitchen — i was so vigorous the cloth came off the head — but the amount of dirt it picked up was really noticeable			0
having said that , i ’m not sure the vibrate function made much difference — it seemed to lift one stubborn stain just as well without it			0
verdict : put the effort in and you ’ll be left with pristine floors			0
3/5 @entity0 found steam cleaners can even be used on furniture such as sofas @entity341 5 - in - 1 , £ 149.99 , @entity343 mop - style model with ‘ pocket technology ’ to leave floors dry and streak - free			1
it also has a detachable handheld gun for smaller @entity348 says : this steamer is so efficient at drying floors after cleaning , you wonder if it ’s worked at all ! thankfully , the grubby mop cloth showed it must have done the job			0
a lot of thought has been put into the whole thing — from the decent - sized mop head , long cord and comprehensive instructions to the handy bag for attachments and the loops on the cloths to stop you from scalding yourself when you remove them			0
it took about 30 seconds to reach steam , and the middle section lifts out to become a handheld steamer			1
the attachments are a little on the large side — the brush was too big to get behind my bath taps — and it ’s not that easy to tell if the machine ’s on or off , but overall , it tackles a wide range of tasks well			0
verdict : a good all - rounder for most jobs in the home			0
4/5 @entity0 tries out one of the models on her shower @entity385 , £ 39.99 , @entity386 to clean large , flat areas such as windows and tiles , or for sanitising bedding , this handheld flat steamer is one of the smallest and cheapest on the @entity392 says : on the plus side , getting started is a doddle			1
simply stick a washable cleaning pad to the base , fill the tank and plug it in			0
however , rather than taking 30 - 60 seconds to heat up , as claimed on the box , i was still waiting three minutes later			0
once it was working , though , it was simple enough to use , and perfect for running over mattresses and pillows like an iron to sanitise them ( steam wipes out dust mites , which can exacerbate allergies )			1
it fared reasonably on tiles too , but with a short flex , a gentle steam output and no attachments , it ’s really only useful for flat surfaces			1
verdict : only good for mattresses and flat surfaces			0

sales of steam cleaners have increased by 94 per cent at @entity21 in the last year
they kill 99 per cent of germs without the use of a single chemical
