by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 04:55 est , 29 november 2013 pledge : the rising numbers suggest @entity3 's promise to keep net migration below 100,000 is running into trouble net migration in @entity8 is on the rise – driven by workers from @entity11 and other southern @entity13 countries fleeing the collapse of their eurozone economies , figures have shown			1
net migration – the touchstone figure that shows how migration is affecting the population as a whole – went up by 15,000 to 182,000 in the year to june , the @entity17 said yesterday			1
the increase was the second quarterly rise in a row , suggesting that @entity3 ’s pledge to cut net migration to below 100,000 is running into trouble			1
the breakdown from the @entity17 showed that ministers are succeeding in reducing the numbers of migrants from outside @entity13			2
but a new wave of workers are now coming from longstanding southern @entity36 member countries , with @entity13 treaties stopping the government from restricting the flow			1
yesterday ’s figures revealed that 118,000 @entity36 citizens came to work in @entity8 in the year to june , more than the number of workers from outside @entity13			1
this included 37,000 @entity46 as well as workers from other eastern @entity13 countries			2
but the @entity17 pointed to a ‘ statistically significant ’ increase in the number coming from other parts of @entity13 , notably from countries in southern @entity13			1
workers from the 15 longest - established @entity36 nations , including @entity11 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , went up from 41,000 in the year to june 2012 to 59,000 in the 12 months to june this year			1
some 27,000 came from @entity11 , 10,000 up on working immigrants from the country in the previous year			0
@entity11 has now shot up to sixth on the league table of the countries sending migrants to @entity8			1
separate figures showed an increase of 52 per cent in new @entity66 numbers issued to @entity56 citizens , 45 per cent to @entity55 nationals , 40 per cent to @entity11 nationals , and 31 per cent to @entity71 four countries have been hit by the eurozone crisis , experiencing high levels of unemployment and a deep credit squeeze			2
the @entity17 revealed that overall , there were 503,000 immigrants in the year to june – down from 517,000 in the previous year			2
the figures also showed that @entity80 limits on student visas have cut the numbers coming into the country to study			0
more people now say they come to @entity8 for work - related reasons than any other the wealth gap between @entity13 's richest and poorest countries creates an ' overwhelming incentive ' for people to move to @entity8 , @entity91 has warned			1
the home secretary suggested new @entity36 member states would have to increase income levels at home before border the @entity8 was forced to open its borders to them			1
she insisted the government was acting to ' address the pull factors that drive up immigration '			0
benefits rules are being changed , with welfare payments ending after six months if someone has no prospect of finding work			0
but mrs may added : ' whatever the government does in terms of reducing the pull factors that draw people to @entity8 , as long as there is such an enormous disparity between @entity36 member states in terms of income per head , there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move from poorer member states to richer member states			1
' that not only puts pressure on communities in countries like @entity8 , it robs poorer @entity36 member states of their most talented people , ' she wrote for @entity129			1
' so in future , we must put in place new arrangements to slow full access to each other ’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration			0
this could , for example , be achieved by requiring new member states to reach a certain level of income or economic output per head before full free movement is allowed			0
' around 176,000 students arrived in the year to june , down from a peak of nearly 250,000 in 2008			0
and the number of students coming in to the country has fallen under the number of migrants coming here to work for the first time in four years			2
however net migration , the number by which migration pushes up the population after emigration has been taken into account , was up to 182,000 compared to 167,000 in the year to june 2012			1
sir @entity162 , of the @entity164 think - tank , said : ‘ the government ’s immigration policy is succeeding in reducing net migration from outside the @entity36 , now down by over a third to its lowest level since 1998			0
‘ but the recent increase in migration from the @entity36 will render it still more difficult to achieve their target			2
a continuing problem is the low outflow of @entity175 migrants which has been steady at around 100,000 for ten years despite inflows of 300,000 or more for most of the period			0
‘ a very significant part of this is students who have been arriving at an annual rate of 139,000 over the last five years			0
’ sir @entity162 added that none of the restrictions already placed on immigration seemed to be harming the economy , as some people had predicted			0
he said : ‘ there is no evidence that the immigration policy is constraining economic activity			0
’ with @entity8 labour market restrictions about to end on citizens from @entity196 and @entity197 , the two countries that joined the @entity36 in 2007 , @entity36 migration was high on the agenda for mr @entity3 as he met fellow leaders at a summit in @entity202 yesterday			1
and home office immigration minister @entity203 insisted that the @entity166 was working to bring net migration down			0
but , with the two most recent sets of quarterly figures both showing net migration on the rise , he chose not to repeat mr @entity3 ’s promise to get numbers down to 1990s levels of below 100,000			2
‘ our reforms are working and immigration continues to fall , ’ mr @entity203 said			0
‘ we have tightened immigration routes where abuse was rife , but are still encouraging the brightest and best to come here to study and work			0
‘ net migration has fallen by nearly a third since its peak in 2010 and across the government we are working hard to bring it down further			0
’ there has been a sharp increase in the number of people from the @entity36 moving to @entity8 for work row : deputy prime minister @entity227 rejected claims from @entity230 @entity229 that a crackdown on benefits for migrants made @entity8 a ' nasty ' country			1

182,000 more people came to @entity8 in the year to june 2013 than left
*surprise* increase *fuelled* by a drop in the number of people leaving
but there was a significant rise in people from the @entity36 looking for work
@entity166 has unveiled new curbs on benefits for migrants
@entity13 *commissioner* @entity229 *accused* @entity8 of being ' nasty '
@entity227 hit back saying freedom of movement is not freedom to claim
@entity3 to *challenge* other @entity36 countries to follow @entity8 's lead at summit
