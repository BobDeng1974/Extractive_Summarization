a relative , who is already said to have been questioned by @entity8 police , told the paper : ‘ they are looking for a suspect that ca n't defend himself			1
‘ @entity29 ' lives ca n't be exposed this way			0
’ @entity15 said he should have been expelled from @entity8 in 1996 - but was allowed to remain in the country after receiving a pardon from then - president @entity33			2
the 40 - year - old was a former employee at the @entity37 holiday resort where the @entity39 family was staying and might have snatched @entity40 in revenge after being sacked , @entity15 reported			1
police identified him as their main suspect after mobile phone records indicated he was around the @entity47 ’ holiday apartment in @entity48 when @entity40 disappeared on may 3 2007 , the paper claimed			1
the flat is a 15 - minute drive from the town of @entity52 where the unnamed suspect was living after he stopped working at the @entity37			2
a source told @entity15 that police believe he may have killed the youngster to ‘ shut her up ’ when he saw the huge media response to the disappearance - and are now trying to find her body			2
motive : the man was reportedly a former employee of the @entity37 in @entity48 , pictured , where @entity5 disappeared in may 2007 @entity8 ’s attorney - general gave the go - ahead for the investigation into the girl ’s disappearance to be reopened last week at the request of the local police , the @entity62 – more than five years after the original inquiry was shelved			1
@entity15 claimed : ‘ police suspicions about the former @entity37 employee arose during the review of the case carried out by a @entity62 team from @entity76			1
‘ this was the strongest new lead presented to state prosecutors which led to the investigation being reopened			0
‘ the man , who died aged 40 in a tractor accident in 2009 , was not on the list of employees handed over to police during the initial investigation by the @entity37 because at the time of @entity89 ’s disappearance he was not working there			1

’ hope : the @entity39 's lawyer said that the couple , seen here with a computer generated image of how @entity89 might have looked in 2012 , are still motivated by the belief that she is still alive it suggests that he may ‘ have committed the kidnap as a form of retaliation against the @entity37			2

’ @entity8 police and a spokesman for the @entity47 declined to comment on the newspaper report yesterday			2
it was written by three journalists including a senior reporter who gave evidence recently at the ongoing libel case brought by @entity123 and @entity39 against @entity124 , the officer in charge of the original investigation , over a book he wrote that accuses them of faking @entity89 ’s abduction to cover up her death			0

their status as ‘ assistentes ’ will allow their legal team to work alongside state prosecutors , keeping the @entity47 informed of all new developments in the case			0
they could also bring a parallel private prosecution against any suspects charged over @entity40 ’s disappearance			0
