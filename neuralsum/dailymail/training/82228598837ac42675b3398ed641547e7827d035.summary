most @entity0 do not want president @entity1 to shut down the @entity3 's terrorist detention facility in @entity4 , @entity5 , according to a poll released this afternoon			1
@entity0 continue to be wary of releasing prisoners with terrorist ties like the ones swapped last month for sgt. @entity10 or moving them to prisons in the @entity3 two in three @entity0 told @entity12 that they want president @entity1 to keep the 149 suspected terrorists being held at @entity14 under lock and key on foreign soil instead of shutting down the camp			1
the majority of @entity0 do n't want the president to close the terrorist holding facility in @entity4 , @entity5 @entity0 have never wanted the president to close @entity4 , but the number against it has increased since the president promised to shut it down on the campaign trail closing @entity4 was one of the president 's core campaign promises in the 2008 presidential election			1
on his first full day in office , @entity1 stated that ' @entity4 will be closed no later than one year from now			0
' that never happened , in part , because the idea became politically unpopular and @entity34 clamped down on the president 's authority to release and transfer detainees			1
@entity0 have never wanted president @entity1 to close the prison and move the most dangerous inmates to prisons on @entity3 soil , but the number in favor of keeping it open has sharply increased since the president brought attention to it by promising to shut it down			1
in 2007 a simple majority , 51 percent , of @entity0 thought the @entity3 should keep @entity4 open			1
by 2009 that number had jumped up to 65 percent , and since then , roughly 66 percent of @entity0 have said they do n't want it to close			0
the majority of the president 's own political party does n't think he should close @entity4			0
the percentage of self - proclaimed @entity56 who believe @entity1 should close @entity14 has decreased 53 percent to 41 percent since 2009			0
in @entity12 's latest poll , 54 percent of self - proclaimed @entity56 said @entity1 should not close the prison			0
nevertheless , president @entity1 has pushed forward with his plan			0
@entity1 told @entity34 in his 2014 @entity61 in january , ' with the @entity63 war ending , this needs to be the year @entity34 lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at @entity4 â€“ because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action , but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals , and setting an example for the rest of the world			1
' current law prohibits the president from transferring terrorists to @entity3 prisons			1
additionally , the president is legally required to show that it is in the national interest of the country to release detainees and steps have been taken to ' substantially mitigate the risk of such individual engaging or reengaging in any terrorist or other hostile activity that threatens the @entity0 ' before they can be repatriated			1
he is also required to give @entity34 30 days notice before releasing detainees			0
@entity1 did not confer with @entity34 in the case of @entity10 exchange , but the @entity1 administration has said they did not break the law because it only applies to prisoner releases , not trades			0
this march 2013 picture shows the exterior of @entity97 at the @entity3 @entity98 at @entity4 in @entity5			2
the president has said he wants to shut down the @entity3 detention facilities there , but he lacks the power to do so even members of the president 's own party do n't want him to shut down @entity105 as a result of the stringent restrictions placed on the president , only 17 @entity4 prisoners have been released in the last 13 months			1
that number includes the five @entity111 fighters @entity1 traded last month			0
one way the president may legally be able to release the terrorists being held at @entity4 is by ending the war in @entity63			2
legal scholars have argued that the @entity3 is only authorized to keep the captured @entity111 associates in prison as long as it is at war with the terrorist organization			0
president @entity1 announced two weeks ago that he would withdraw the majority of @entity0 's troops in @entity63 by the end of the year , effectively ending the war there as far as the @entity0 is concerned			2
administration officials recently told @entity126 that the president 's first preference would be to work with @entity34 to shut down the terrorist detention camp rather than go it alone , however			2
and , according to a @entity132 article from earlier this year , the @entity1 administration believes that a third of the combatants being held at @entity4 bay are too dangerous to release outright but are unsuitable for trial , further complicating the matter and making it unlikely the the president will fully close the camp at the end of this year .			2

one of *candidate* @entity1 's promises was that he would shut down @entity4
the president has been unable to do so because @entity34 passed *legislation* restricting him from transferring terrorists to prisons on @entity3 soil
@entity1 is also legally required to show that detainees he repatriates are unlikely to *retaliate* against the @entity3
a new poll shows closing @entity4 would be an unpopular move even if the president were able to find a way to shut down the detention facility
two in three @entity0 want @entity1 to keep @entity14 open
