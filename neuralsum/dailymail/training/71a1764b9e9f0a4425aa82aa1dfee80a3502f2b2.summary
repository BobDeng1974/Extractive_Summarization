the hospital where one man died of @entity2 and two nurses treating him contracted the deadly virus has seen a steep and sharp decline in patients			1
@entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , has become a ' ghost town , ' with patients cancelling previously scheduled appointments for procedures and surgeries and others going out of their way to travel to other facilities even in emergency situations			1
this after the hospital took in a patient infected with @entity2 on september 30 , @entity21 , who later died at the facility on october 8			1
then , on october 15 , another nurse who cared for @entity21 , @entity40 , also tested positive for @entity2			2
@entity41 , who is currently being treated at the @entity43 hospital in @entity44 , @entity45 , was recently downgraded from good to fair condition , while @entity47 , who is being treated at @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , has been in stable condition since being admitted			0
there are also fears that a third woman who handled some of @entity21 's specimens may have been exposed to the virus , and she has been quarantined aboard a @entity59 cruise ship during the possible incubation period for the virus			0
downgraded : @entity37 ( seen being treated at the @entity43 hospital ) , the first nurse to contract the deadly virus at @entity7 , has just been downgraded from good to fair condition holding steady : @entity40 ( above ) , the second nurse to contract the disease at the hospital , is in stable condition at @entity48 in @entity49 ' it feels like a ghost town , ' @entity67 , a local health care vendor who has been to the hospital recently , told @entity73			1
' no one is even walking around the hospital			0
' what 's more , when a call was placed to the hospital to ask how long the wait was for emergency room services , it was revealed there was no wait time			0
prior to this , average wait time at the hospital was roughly an hour			0
nothing : even outside the hospital there is no activity now , the hospital is working to go about proving how safe their facility is , and trying to gain back public trust			1
' i would tell this community that @entity99 is an absolutely safe hospital to come to , ' dr. @entity94 , the chief clinical officer of @entity95 , which owns the @entity8 hospital , told @entity101			2
' we 've been in communication with our doctors that have their private offices in our professional buildings around the campus who are getting 40 , 50 , 60 percent cancellations just for fear of being somewhere in the geography of the hospital where @entity2 is treated			2
' only time will tell if this hospital can bounce back , especially as public fear of the deadly virus continues to grow .			0

@entity7 has seen a sharp decline in patients since one man died of @entity2 and two nurses contracted the disease at the facility
one local health care vendor *compared* the @entity8 , @entity9 , hospital to a ' ghost town , ' and there is currently no wait to see an @entity33 doctor
now , doctors and staff are trying to hard to *convince* the public that the facility is indeed safe
