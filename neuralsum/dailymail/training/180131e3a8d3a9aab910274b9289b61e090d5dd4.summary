@entity3 , 56 , had been woken in the early hours of the morning and had left his room twice to ‘ request politely ’ that two drunks quieten down so he could sleep			1
in the violence that followed , mr @entity3 , who was still wearing his pyjamas , lost a ‘ substantial part ’ of his ear , which ended up on the floor , leaving him permanently disfigured			1
he claimed he was worried about defending himself for fear of being prosecuted like @entity21 – the farmer convicted of manslaughter after shooting a burglar dead			2
mr @entity3 , who played surgeon @entity25 in @entity5 and currently plays @entity26 in @entity27 , had been staying at the @entity28 while performing in a play at the @entity30 in @entity31 , the court heard			1
he was woken at about 4.30am on march 24 last year by @entity32 , 33 , and @entity33 , 32 , who were shouting in the corridor outside his ground - floor room			1
@entity36 , prosecuting , told @entity37 : ‘ they had come down from @entity39 with friends and they were out drinking and socialising			1
at 4.30am in the morning they had reached the stage where they were excessively drunk and had also reached the stage where drink converted them to being raucous and , ultimately , violent			0
’ the actor , 6ft 5in tall and sporting a large moustache , told the court how the pair were making ‘ banshee - like ’ noises which woke him up and resulted in him opening his room door			1
he said : ‘ i cast a fairly strange figure			0
i had a huge moustache for the part i was playing in the play , with a t - shirt and pyjama bottoms			2
’ he asked the men to keep the noise down as he was trying to sleep – but the noise soon started up again			2
he said : ‘ male one was encouraging male two to “ come and look at the old man in his pyjamas ”			0
’ mr @entity3 , who has since grown his hair to cover the injury , said it was a ‘ sport ’ to them and he could hear ‘ wailing and laughter ’ from the men			1
hearing more noise , he went to his door and warned he was going to call security but there was not a phone in his room			0
he was on his way to the @entity80 hotel reception , walking barefoot , when the pair laid into him , the jury heard			2
@entity3 was woken in the early hours of the morning and had left his room twice to ¿ request politely ¿ that two drunks quieten down @entity33 , 32 , ( left ) and @entity32 , 33 , ( right ) were visiting @entity31 and had been out drinking mr @entity36 said : ‘ as he approached , the two defendants deliberately blocked his path			1
‘ he told them he needed to get past and placed his hands between them , and tried to force his way through , perhaps not unreasonably considering the situation he was in			2
‘ at this point they both decided to grab his arms and set about him			0
both men threw a flurry of drunken punches , some landed , some did n’t			0
ultimately , it ended with him being dragged on the ground face down			0
’ mr @entity3 told the court : ‘ i think in total there were about 15 blows , of which only four hurt			1
’ @entity32 , 32 , from @entity105 , @entity39 , pictured arriving at @entity37 this morning where he is accused of being involved in an attack which left @entity5 star @entity3 with part of his ear bitten off at one point , @entity109 was on top of the actor and @entity32 was by his left side			1
fighting back tears , mr @entity3 described how the ‘ melee ’ turned into his ear being bitten off by @entity32			1
he said : ‘ the next thing i was aware of was a pain in my left ear which triggered a massive response within me			0
the adrenaline it gave me enabled me to rip my right hand away			0
‘ the only thing i could do is put my thumb in his eye socket to make him release			0
‘ an image of @entity21 , the guy who shot the intruders in his house , went through my mind			0
i have got to do enough damage to hurt him but not so much i get prosecuted for poking someone ’s eye out – it ’s bizarre the thing you think about at times like this			0
’ it was at this point , he said that his ‘ guardian angel ’ @entity147 , a nurse staying at the hotel with her partner , heard the fighting and came out of her room			2
she grabbed one of the defendants by his collar and held the other back with her arm to stop them having another go at @entity158 , the jury heard			0
the actor said : ‘ she saved me from a lot further damage			2
’ @entity162 says he was woken up by @entity32 , 33 , and @entity33 , 32 , who were shouting in his hotel corridor last march after staggering to his feet , he saw there was blood all over him			1
he said : ‘ i looked down and there was my ear lying on the carpet			0
’ he picked up his ear and grabbed one of the men , but the pair managed to flee and mr @entity3 returned to his room with @entity175 , where they put his ear in a glass of water to preserve it			1
the court heard how the two defendants did not return to the hotel for several hours – by which point they had tried to check in to a nearby @entity184 but were turned away			0
