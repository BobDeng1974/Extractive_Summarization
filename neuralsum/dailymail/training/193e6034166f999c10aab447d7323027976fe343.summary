the footage - captioned ' i do n't drive but i 'm pretty certain this is n't legal or safe ' - was uploaded to @entity12 on monday ' the selfishness of these people astounds me - how could they live with themselves if they killed an innocent passerby , just for the sake of trending on social media for a few hours ?

' but stunned campaigners branded the man 's actions ' shocking '			2
mr @entity50 , of the @entity51 , said : ' there is no way you can be in proper control of a vehicle with a burger in one hand a drink in the other - that is just plain stupidity			0
