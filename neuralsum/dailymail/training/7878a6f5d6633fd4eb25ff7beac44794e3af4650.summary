by @entity0 published : 02:33 est , 10 july 2012 updated : 03:48 est , 10 july 2012 a group of killjoy students have proven that @entity4 's heroic glides through @entity5 would n't allow miraculous escapes and flying kicks - instead , @entity4 would probably die			1
to pull off the famous stunt , the @entity4 would need a much bigger cape , say a group of @entity12 physics students from @entity13 - or he should invest in jets to slow his descent			1
with his current , smaller cape , @entity4 would hit the ground at around 50mph , causing catastrophic injuries and probably death			2
gliding to his doom : with his current , smaller cape , @entity4 would hit the ground at around 50mph , causing catastrophic injuries and probably death dashing the dreams of comic fans across the world , four students from the @entity13 said that while @entity4 could glide using his cape as he does in the 2005 film ‘ @entity33 ’ , his landing would almost certainly prove fatal			0
the superhero is back in cinemas later this month in ‘ @entity36 ’ and they suggested @entity4 should go shopping before trying a similar attempt to become airborne over @entity5			0
‘ if @entity4 wanted to survive the flight , he would definitely need a bigger cape , ’ said @entity39 , 22 , one of the students in the final year of their four - year @entity41			2
‘ or if he preferred to keep his style intact he could opt for using active propulsion , such as jets to keep himself aloft			0
’ deadly stunts : to pull off the famous stunt , the @entity4 would need a much bigger cape , say a group of @entity12 physics students from @entity13 - or he should invest in jets to slow his descent in a paper titled ‘ trajectory of a falling @entity4 ’ , the group argued that if he jumped from a 492 - foot high building , the 15 - foot wingspan of @entity4 's cape would allow him to glide 1148 feet			1
however , he would reach a speed of 68 miles per hour before hitting the ground at a life - threatening speed of 50 mph .			0

@entity4 's famous glides would mean superhero hits ground at 50mph
*calculations* by team of physicists
@entity70 should invest in bigger cape - or use jets to slow him down
