mobile phone bills should begin to fall after a watchdog ordered telecoms companies to slash the cost of calling another network			1
for years , mobile users have faced extra charges for so - called ' cross-network ' calls to friends , family and colleagues who have a different provider			1
the charges , known as the ' mobile termination rate ' , is passed on to the customer who made the call , but also affect calls made from landline operators such as @entity18 and @entity19			1
for years , mobile users have faced extra charges for so - called ' cross-network ' calls to friends , family and colleagues who have a different provider at the moment , these charges add 0.826 pence a minute to the usual cost of calls			1
however , @entity28 said yesterday that operators must slash them by more than 40 per cent over the next two years			2
by april 2017 , mobile companies will be allowed to only charge 0.475 pence per minute extra			1
@entity31 , a telecoms analyst at @entity32 , said : ' this is a good thing for the consumer			0
the main benefit will be to customers making calls from a fixed line , where fees are stubbornly high … so it is particularly good for the elderly			0
' @entity28 research has shown that older customers tend to use landlines much more than younger people			2
according to official figures , the vast majority of the population – 93 per cent – owns a mobile , and around three - quarters have both a landline and a mobile			2
last year , around 16 per cent of adults in the @entity54 relied solely on their mobile , and did not have a landline at all			0
mobile operators have spent years lobbying to keep the mobile termination rate in place , helping to fatten their profits			1
the rates have been steadily reduced since the 1990s , when they were as high as 25p per minute , as mobile technology became more efficient and costs to the networks fell			2
however , yesterday the network operators expressed disappointment over @entity28 's decision to cut them further , and issued a veiled threat they could increase other charges to make up for the reduction			1
last year , around 16 per cent of adults in the @entity54 relied solely on their mobile , and did not have a landline a spokesman for @entity73 said : ' the proposed implementation puts at risk future investments and our ability to offer customers the lowest possible prices			0
' a telecoms source said that mobile phone companies would not be able to offer the same level of service if they do not get as much income from customers			1
operators would face a choice to either allow the standards of their network and customer services to slip , or to recoup the money they have lost by increasing charges elsewhere			2
a spokesman for @entity96 added : ' there 's no such thing as a free lunch			0
mobile operators invest billions of pounds in their networks			0
the cost of handling calls from other operators comes at a cost and needs to be recovered from those operators			0
' mr @entity31 said : ' the charges are based on the old - world of ancient switch networks			0
[ it is time to ask ] whether the system is still relevant '			0
mobile operators , however , said they were pleased that @entity28 has given them two years to reduce the charges , as they had feared they would have to slash them overnight			1
@entity115 , of the consumer campaign group , @entity117 , predicted that @entity28 would continue slashing the charges for cross-network calls			2
' landline users have effectively been subsidising mobile users for years			0
that has to go away , ' he said			0
mr @entity31 added that @entity28 would keep pressure on mobile companies to pass as much of the savings as possible to customers .			1
