@entity0 took down at least two official websites in @entity2 making good on threats after a city banned feeding the homeless			1
in a video claimed to be posted by @entity0 on monday , an unidentified person wearing a mask and speaking with a digitally - altered voice threatened to crash the sites if the city of @entity12 did n't lift bans on panhandling at intersections , sleeping in public downtown and feeding the homeless			1
the sites @entity17 and @entity18 were offline for several hours on monday but back up later that evening			1

city manager @entity41 said that officials were discussing the issue			0
@entity12 drew national attention last month after police cited 90 - year - old @entity27 and two pastors for feeding homeless people at @entity48			1
@entity27 , a @entity28 veteran , and others served a four - course meal by the beach as a crowd of nearly 100 mostly homeless and volunteers cheered their arrival			1
despite being charged with violating the new law by feeding the homeless , @entity27 said he 's not deterred and even went back out to serve more food at a public park			1
@entity27 , affectionately known as ' chef @entity27 , ' has several programs , including a culinary school to train the homeless and help find them jobs in local kitchens			2
he and two @entity2 ministers face up to 60 days in jail and a $ 500 fine			0
known locally as ' chef @entity27 ' , @entity66 runs several programs to feed and help the homeless including a culinary school to train them to find jobs in local kitchens the faceoff in @entity12 over the ordinance restricting public feeding of the homeless has pitted those with compassionate aims against residents and businesses trying to protect their neighborhoods			1

he said it was passed to ensure that public places are open to everyone			0

' the parks have just been overrun and were inaccessible to locals and businesses , ' @entity93 said			0
after several hours both affected websites were once again up and running following the denial of service attack which forced the city to shut them down as a precaution the issue of feeding the homeless has cropped up multiple times during mr @entity66 's long life			1
@entity27 fought a similar ordinance in court 15 years ago and said he 's prepared to mount another legal challenge			2
