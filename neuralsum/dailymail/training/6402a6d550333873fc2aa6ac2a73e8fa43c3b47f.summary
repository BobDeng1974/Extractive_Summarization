by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:50 am on 9th december 2011 when @entity3 saw the picture of her daughter taken at her nursery , she was delighted with the photographer ’s work			1
the samples showed two - year - old @entity10 posing happily and naturally , and mrs @entity3 was quick to order £ 10 prints for the family home			1
but she was horrified when the prints arrived to find that the photographer had airbrushed away the purple birthmark that runs from @entity18 ’s top lip to her cheek			1
anger : @entity3 and @entity21 are furious after a professional photographer altered pictures of their daughter @entity10 , pictured left and right , to remove her birthmark from the image ‘ i think it ’s absolutely disgusting , ’ said mrs @entity3			1
‘ who is this man to decide my daughter is n’t perfect ? ’ @entity31 , who runs @entity32 , has apologised and said the picture had been altered by accident – it was the photo of another child which should have been changed			1
but mrs @entity3 , a 30 - year - old retail merchandiser , said : ‘ we live in a world which has all manner of pressures to conform and look perfect and for someone to decide that a two - year - old is n’t pretty enough because she has a birthmark on her face is scandalous			1
birthmarks are a benign skin irregularity which appear on the skin at or shortly after birth			2
as many as one in ten babies have a birthmark and they can appear anywhere on the skin			1
they are not painful and are caused by an overgrowth of blood vessels or excess skin pigmentation			2
one of the most common types of birthmark is a hemangioma			1
these occur when many new blood vessels grow in a specific area on the skin			2
no one knows what causes a birthmark but they are not painful or a sign of illness			1
a strawberry hemangioma , where the skin is red and sticks out of the skin go away untreated by the time a child is about nine years old			0
another kind of birthmark is the port wine stain , which is level with the outer layer of skin			1
children with these normally have them on the face and neck			0
doctors can sometimes use laser surgery to treat birthmarks to reduce their appearance			0
‘ where does it stop ? if one of the kids had wonky teeth , would he have altered them to make them “ perfect ” ? it ’s not up to him to play @entity96			0
' there are enough worries about the prejudices she may endure later in life without having to worry about adult male photographers , especially when she ’s just two years old			0
’ the photographer visited the @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107 , around six weeks ago and took pictures of the majority of youngsters there			0
parents were then able to view the photos and choose which ones to order			1
on these pictures , @entity10 ’s birthmark was still present			1
mrs @entity3 , who lives in @entity106 with her husband @entity117 and other children @entity119 , five , and @entity120 , three , said she did not accept mr @entity31 ’s comment that the birthmark had been removed because of a mix - up with the photo of another child			1
‘ what are the chances of another child requiring a birthmark to be removed ? ’ she asked			2
he ’s offered us a free print but i do n’t want anything to do with him			0
’ @entity135 , manager of @entity105 , said several parents were unhappy with the photos			2
‘ some children ’s eyes appeared to have changed from blue to brown while others just did n’t look very good , ’ she said			0
‘ we feel very let down			0
whether or not @entity10 ’s birthmark was deliberately altered i do n’t know , but either way it ’s a very unfortunate incident			1
’ mr @entity31 said he would not dream of altering a child ’s photo for cosmetic reasons and @entity10 ’s picture had been altered because of a mix - up with reference numbers			2
‘ i was mortified when i realised the mistake , ’ he said			0
‘ i have spoken with @entity10 ’s parents and offered a free print			2
‘ i hold my hands up and admit i made a mistake but that ’s what it was , a genuine mistake			0
‘ i would never alter a photograph in that way			0
how dare i ? who am i to decide what features should and should n’t appear in pictures ? ‘ we are a small business with limited resources and this was a genuine oversight for which i am eternally apologetic			0
i thought the family were ok with the situation but obviously not			0
