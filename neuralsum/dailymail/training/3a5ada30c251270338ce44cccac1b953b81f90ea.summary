@entity1 's decision not to back a @entity3 law banning plastic bags has caused friction with @entity6 and stunned environmental campaigners			1
@entity6 's environment minister has criticised @entity1 's lack of support for the law , describing it as ' astounding ' particularly for a seafaring nation			1
environmental campaigners have also been left flabbergasted by @entity1 's move earlier this month , especially given the @entity17 government 's support for reducing the environmental impact of bags on the landscape and wildlife			2
under threat : @entity1 beautyspots like @entity24 , @entity25 and marine life are under threat from the growing problem of waste plastic bags - which @entity1 chose not to ban under @entity31 law however , a @entity33 spokesperson said : ' while we are determined to tackle the blight caused by discarded carrier bags , the proposed @entity6 scheme is illegal under @entity31 packaging law			1
' @entity39 , @entity6 's environment minister , pointed out the risks to the environment of adopting @entity1 's position			2
quoted in @entity43 , he said : ' the bags are a serious problem , above all at sea , and it is astounding that @entity1 , which is serious about the environment and has a seafaring tradition going back centuries , does not want to defend the seas from plastic pollution which suffocates and kills many marine animals			2
' three years ago , @entity6 's coastline had one of the worst records for plastic bag pollution ; @entity6 consumed one quarter of all @entity3 ’s single - use plastic shopping bags			0
a study showed that plastic bags accounted for 72 per cent of the waste washed up on its coasts			0
but since 2011 , @entity6 has introduced a ban on supply of the carrier bags ; supermarkets and shops are only allowed to provide biodegradable plastic bags or thicker reusable ones			1
the @entity73 country now wants to go one step further ; to be able to impose fines on shops that fail to comply with the rules			0
to do this , it needs an @entity31 law to rubber stamp the ban			1
eyesore : the @entity85 's @entity84 campaign calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags this month a report by the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) revealed that for every mile of @entity1 's coastline , there are on average 72 disposable shopping bags washed up			1
the problem is also getting worse			0
to tackle the growing problem , @entity96 has pledged to introduce charges and @entity99 and @entity100 have already imposed fees resulting in bag use dropping by up to 96 per cent in some supermarkets			1
the @entity85 also backs a move to rid the country of plastic bags , with its @entity108 campaign – which calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags in our countryside and rivers			2
but @entity114 has fallen short of imposing a ban			0
environmental charity @entity118 has campaigned for years for plastic bags to be banned as long as alternatives are adequately highlighted , people and shopkeepers have enough time to prepare , and it does not have a ' disproportionate impact on the poor '			0
@entity1 ex-pat and waste expert @entity123 , who lives in @entity126 called the @entity1 position ' astonishing '			0
mr @entity123 , head of the @entity128 , told the @entity43 : ' the @entity1 has been called to order on this at home yet it is opposing it in @entity131 – it ’s paradoxical			0

@entity1 *blocked* a ban on plastic bags in the @entity31 earlier this month
@entity99 and @entity100 have imposed charges to reduce plastic bags
@entity6 wants an @entity31 law to ban them so it can impose fines for *violations*
