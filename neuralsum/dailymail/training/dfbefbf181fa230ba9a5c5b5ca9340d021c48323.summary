by @entity0 it was one of the most haunting tales to emerge from the titanic disaster			0
while others rushed to the lifeboats as the ship sank , millionaire @entity4 stoically sat sipping brandy with his personal secretary @entity9 , declaring they were ' prepared to go down like gentlemen '			0
' no woman shall be left aboard this ship because @entity13 was a coward , ' he told a survivor			1
loyal : a newly - discovered photograph @entity17 , left , shows the valet had dark - skin , which may explain why his master @entity13 chose to go down on the liner rather than allow the servant to be denied a place on a ' first class ' lifeboat @entity4 famously told other passengers ' we 've dressed in our best and we 'll go down like gentlemen ' as they smoked cigars in the dining room			1
the immortal words were recorded in the @entity33 film ( pictured ) now , for the first time , a face can be put to the name of mr @entity9			1
the first ever picture of @entity17 was found by @entity38 at the boarding school where the boy was educated an archivist at @entity42 , the @entity44 boarding school he attended , has unearthed this picture ( right ) of him aged 12			0
the photograph – taken in 1901 , 11 years before he died on the @entity33 – shows mr @entity9 , the son of an @entity48 father and @entity50 mother , dressed in his school uniform for a group shot			1
unlike the much - photographed @entity4 industrialist mr @entity4 , who died aged 46 , no photographs of mr @entity9 were believed to exist			0
but after the @entity57 in @entity58 appealed for information about mr @entity9 to mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking , @entity38 , the archivist and librarian at @entity56 boarding school @entity42 , uncovered the lost image in the school 's files			2
he also found tributes to mr @entity9 , who was the youngest of four brothers born in @entity58 to an @entity48 father and @entity50 mother , in the school 's journal from 1912 and 1913			2
one , from then @entity42 headmaster father @entity70 , said : ' those who knew @entity9 at school will not require any assurance that he met death bravely and even willingly rather than , perhaps , take the place of someone else in the lifeboats			0
' one of his schoolmates added at the time : ' i did not expect to see his name in the list of survivors			0
@entity9 was unlikely to be saved when any were lost			0
' passengers wait to be rescued in @entity86 ' titanic drama , which also depicted @entity4 's last words			1
it is likely that @entity17 would have been denied a lifeboat because of his skin colour fateful voyage : the cruise liner titanic sets off from @entity94 docks on april 10 , 1912 in a further journal a year on from the disaster mr @entity9 's mother is reported to have presented the school with books and music as a memorial to her son , who was a talented pianist			1
yesterday @entity103 said : ' going back to @entity9 's time a greater part of the student body came from the thriving @entity56 business community in @entity58 , so it is not surprising that he attended @entity42			2
' @entity109 , @entity110 at the @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113 , confirmed : ' it is a rare photograph , i 'm not aware of any other photographs of @entity9			0
' he must have been valued by @entity117 because he travelled first class with him			2
' his chauffeur , who also died on the @entity33 , was travelling second class			1
' doomed : an original @entity122 photograph of the @entity33 leaving @entity123 shows the ship cutting through the wave disaster : an artist 's depiction of the moment the ship went down shows the mad scramble to safety among the handful of passengers who managed to get lifeboats			1

@entity13 's last words were used in 1997 hit film @entity33
@entity140 was entitled to ' first class ' lifeboat but would not leave valet behind
