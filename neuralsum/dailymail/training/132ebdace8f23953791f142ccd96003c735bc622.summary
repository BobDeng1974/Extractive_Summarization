@entity0 fixed his inquisitor with his coldest stare			1
‘ why would i crash ? ’ he bristled			2
‘ have i crashed all year ? ’ he paused			2
‘ i ’m pretty good at this , you know , ’ he murmured			0
nobody asks @entity0 about crashing most weeks			1
but this is n’t most weeks			0
the week of pure racing freedom			0
the next 48 hours , @entity0 agrees , are the most important of his professional life			1
‘ i ’m fully aware of that , ’ he adds			0
‘ of course i know that			0
’ @entity17 is suddenly on the agenda because with the stakes higher than at any time this year , the liberty to be good , or bad , when racing begins is also at its greatest			1
@entity0 greets his many fans at the @entity23 as he prepares for the final race of the season @entity0 puts his gloves on in the garage as @entity28 prepare to crown their first world champion @entity0 soars around the track in @entity31 knowing that his second world title is within his grasp @entity0 and his @entity28 team - mate @entity34 are the only drivers capable of winning the prize			1
with the constructors ’ title long decided , instruction will now be kept to a minimum			2
within the reasonable parameters of team support , there will be no limit on selfish ambition and that carries risk			2
@entity48 took @entity49 out at 160mph in 1990 in similar circumstances			1
if @entity0 did the same thing to @entity34 , he would be champion			1
‘ that ’s not me , ’ @entity0 insisted			1
‘ i want to win by winning			2
’ there ’s no temptation to be naughty ? ‘ i want to win by winning			2
i ’ve never raced that way			0
’ @entity48 was your hero and he could be naughty			1
quietly , almost a murmur again			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity48 was naughty , ’ @entity0 said			1
@entity48 ( front left ) prepares to launch at title rival @entity49 's ( front right ) @entity62 at the first corner @entity48 leads the way as the warring drivers leave @entity67 track in 1990 with the @entity69 crowned champion @entity0 takes a picture with an adoring fan as the @entity73 driver meets and greets the public we do n’t get @entity0 , the way we did n’t get @entity77			1
we do n’t get what drives them , their desires , their furies			0
we wonder why they ca n’t be like everybody else , lose those outer prickles			0
we compare @entity77 to @entity86 , and @entity0 to @entity87 , @entity88 or @entity89 , grouping them by sport			1
yet @entity92 and the drivers are familiar products of their sporting culture — the way @entity96 typifies @entity99 cricket or @entity100 has the background of many captains of the @entity99 football team — @entity0 and @entity77 are men apart			1
@entity106 tennis champions do not come from nondescript towns north of @entity108 ; grand prix greats are not born in @entity111 council houses			0
@entity77 became the first @entity73 winner at @entity113 for 76 years , yet he is still not universally liked @entity0 won the world title in his second season in @entity116 at the tender age of 23 even in @entity31 , when @entity0 spoke at the pre-race press conference on thursday he was the only black man in the room			1
his attitude , like @entity77 , is that of the outsider			1
your former kart boss @entity123 had a lot of nice things to say about you			0
‘ he was n’t a kart boss			0
’ he was an adviser , or whatever role he had there ... ‘ he was a mechanic			0
’ @entity0 ’s mantra this weekend is that it is just another race			1
fastest in practice on friday , he did not appear a man with weight on his shoulders			0
maybe his spikiness — the look of disdain for @entity34 ’s proffered hand in the photoshoot was priceless — is just the suit of armour he has donned through the years			1
@entity34 offers @entity0 his hand , but the @entity145 looks less than impressed with the gesture @entity0 and @entity34 were friends growing up but their relationship has been severely tested as team - mates @entity0 will know he is not a natural fit with men like @entity152 ; he will know he has never been widely popular back home			1
certainly , he will know playing the game will not change that			0
he wins — just as @entity77 won to change public perception			1
‘ i am very much aware that this is a platform , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ there are people turning up with my caps on , turning up with flags , people i meet at the airport or on the street who are shaking because they watch me every weekend , are nervous for me , excited for me , who are with me , wishing they could be me			2
i do feel like i ’m living the dream for others — that ’s why i like to share it through posting pictures and by saying positive things rather than just waving a bunch of cash around			0
’ like @entity175 ? ‘ yeah			0
i ’ve no interest in inspiring people like that , ’ @entity0 continued			1
‘ i want it to be more than , “ hey , here ’s me by a car ... here ’s me by a mountain ”			0
i want to tell them , “ if i can do it , you can do it ”			0
’ @entity0 admits sunday 's race will be the biggest test of his @entity116 career the @entity28 team undertake a pit stop ahead of a potentially mesmeric weekend in the @entity194 if @entity0 finishes second in @entity31 he will win the title , but things have not always gone well for him in the season finale			1
in his debut year in 2007 , a first - lap error and a gearbox issue meant he lost the @entity201 while he only won in 2008 on the final corner of the last lap. not the best omen for sunday ’s race			2
one of @entity0 ’s latest posts quotes martin luther king			1
his dream is more mundane , obviously , but that does not make it worthless and it should be @entity0 ’s prize on sunday			1
he has not been out of the top two in the last six grand prix races , and if he replicates that finish he will be champion			0
as this will be his second title , it will be a modern milestone			2
he would be the first @entity73 driver to win multiple championships since @entity217 ( 1969 , 1971 and 1973 ) , and join an exclusive band of @entity73 racers comprising @entity220 ( 1962 and 1968 ) and @entity221 ( 1963 and 1965 )			1
@entity0 claimed not to have considered his place in the pantheon before it was mentioned , but maybe that is a defence mechanism , too			1
he already knows he has a way to fall if unsuccessful , without adding the gaze of history to the equation			0
there is so much that is random to go wrong in @entity116 , plus the spanner in the works of arbitrary double points			1
if @entity0 finishes first , second or simply ahead of @entity34 , he wins			1
if @entity34 wins and @entity0 finishes seventh or lower , the @entity236 wins — under the scoring system used for the previous 18 races			1
the controversy arises if @entity34 wins and @entity0 finishes third , fourth , fifth or sixth ; or @entity34 comes second and @entity0 finishes between sixth and 10th			1
in this situation , the @entity236 is champion because this race — and only this race — counts double			2
@entity0 goes wide at @entity244 in 2007 , his seventh - place finish ending his bid to become world champion @entity248 comforts @entity0 after the rookie lost out on the title to @entity251 by a single point @entity0 would still claim a place in history — but only in the most gypped category			1
with the randomness of technical malfunctions , a twist of fate here could have greater professional consequence than any event in @entity0 ’s career			1
this is his to lose , and he knows it			0
‘ i ’m excited , ’ he insisted			0
‘ why should n’t i be ? i ’m in the best place in my whole life			2
i ’m with the best team , i ’ve got the best car , i ’m in the best shape — i ’m excited , man			2
the last two times i went into the championship , i was probably nervous			0
it ’s a lot different now			0
‘ i ’ve got to control it but i ’m good at that			0
i guess it ’s the same as keeping pretty chilled when i get to drive a @entity116 car every weekend			2
that ’s a pretty huge thing — but controlling it is how i ’m built			0
i ca n’t wait to get in the car			0
‘ i have a plan			0
i ’m working with my guys , we ’ve already spoken about it , all the things i need to focus on , all the things i ’ve learned through the year			0
i do n’t need to drive the race of my life ; just my best			2
i feel i ’m here like any other weekend			2
if you build it up that ’s when the issues come			0
’ it is perhaps a sign of @entity0 ’s resolve that he will be without his family in @entity31			1
asked for the guest list , he became tight - lipped again			2
‘ no - one , ’ he said			2
‘ a few friends in the grandstand			0
generally , through the year , i ’ve not had people come			0
‘ i ’ve got a job to do			0
’ he stared that cool stare			0
a very singular man , @entity0 .			1

the stakes are high for @entity307 ahead of the most important weekend of his professional life
@entity0 would win his second title if he took out team - mate @entity34 in a manner similar to @entity48 's move on @entity49 in 1990
but the @entity145 says that is not in his make - up and he wants to win fairly
like @entity77 , @entity0 is not understood by the @entity73 public
@entity31 sees the introduction of controversial double points system
