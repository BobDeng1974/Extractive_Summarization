living with a snoring partner can be nothing short of torture			1
but former @entity4 journalist @entity3 claims to have found a cure to a problem which plagues millions of couples			1
miss @entity3 says she was forced to search for a remedy after her husband recently began to snore , preventing her from sleeping			1
problem solved : @entity3 and husband @entity11 who tried the @entity12 rather than use remedies such as nasal strips and mouth sprays , the mother of four says she persuaded her husband , 53 - year - old tv producer @entity11 , to try the @entity18 , which works by applying acupressure to the wearer ’s finger			1
she claims that the £ 30 silver device fixed the problem almost immediately			1
on her website , 47 - year - old miss @entity3 , @entity4 art correspondent between 1995 and 2004 , said : ‘ mr @entity25 did n’t always snore			1
but recently , it ’s been a bit noisy chez nous			2
so , he has tried two things			0
‘ as you can see , the ring has a little dimple on one side , and a sort of shelf on the other			1
they are twin acupressure points			0
' rather like those car - sickness bands which press key positions on the underside of your wrist ( and work brilliantly ) , the snore ring does the same on your finger			1
‘ thirty minutes before slumber time , the @entity47 should place the ring at the base of his / her little finger with the gap facing upwards			2
' the overall effect is that your partner is suddenly wearing a signet ring			2
' if you like this @entity58 effect , great			0
if you do n’t , never mind			0
just turn over and go to sleep			0
you will not be disturbed			0
‘ in the morning , the ring comes off			2
you must not wear it during the day			0
who knew ? ’ miss @entity3 says the problem might also have been alleviated by a second measure			1
her husband has taken up regular cycling , helping him lose weight			2
around one in four women and four in ten men are frequent snorers , while half the population is said to snore occasionally			0
a recent @entity75 study has claimed that snorers are more likely to have a heart attack than smokers or the obese , and the condition could thicken the arteries , leading to brain haemorrhages , strokes and heart attacks			0
