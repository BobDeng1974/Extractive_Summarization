@entity8 has never spoken because he is so disabled			1
' i was just floored , literally floored			0
one of the rapid response team had to hold me up , i was just sobbing			0
' it has definitely given me hope that he will speak again			2
you have gone from thinking that he is not capable of doing it to seeing and hearing that he is			0

' we were told he was n’t going to live past two and this month he turned nine			1

ms @entity16 , who looks after him full time at their home in @entity83 , @entity84 , added : ' he is just a happy kid			1

even with all his issues he is still the best thing i have ever done			0
' you go through life with your blinkers on			0
you do n’t think how many disabled children there actually are			0
' but @entity8 fills me with wonder every day			1
one of his nicknames is my wonder boy			0
' dr @entity31 , from @entity121 and @entity122 , said : ' i walked over to little @entity8 and introduced myself			1
' when he repeated my name after me , i assumed that it was because his consciousness was improving			0
' i told his mum this , only for her to say he could n’t speak so he ca n’t have said my name			0
' again i introduced myself and the same thing happened , as clear as anything he said " @entity35 "			0

' @entity13 was bawling her eyes out after hearing her son say his first word ever - though i think she was pretty miffed it was n’t " @entity159 "			2

@entity8 was born with a condition that *hampers* brain development
his brain wo n't develop beyond that of a five - month - old baby
his mother has been given hope now that he has said his first word
he repeated the name of a doctor called to his house after an emergency
@entity16 , from @entity84 , was told he would n't live past two
he recently *celebrated* his ninth birthday against all odds
