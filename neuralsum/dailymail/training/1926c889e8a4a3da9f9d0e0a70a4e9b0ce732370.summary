speaking at a @entity33 lunch this afternoon he said : ' to my intense surprise , because i do n't normally do this kind of thing , i broke down completely			2
' it was the shredding effect of hearing what we did , what we did , to those people and the sense of total failure and betrayal			0
' so we are taking it , and i am passionate about this , as seriously as we are able to do			0

' the archbishop also spoke about highly - controversial moves to examine whether the confidentiality rules should be relaxed to allow clergy who heard confessions about sex abuse could alert the authorities			1
