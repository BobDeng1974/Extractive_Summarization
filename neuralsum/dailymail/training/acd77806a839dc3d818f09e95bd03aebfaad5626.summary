by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 08:09 est , 15 july 2013 @entity1 is said to be hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its smartwatch - dubbed the @entity4			1
according to the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , the tech firm wants to bring in fresh pairs of eyes to look at the device because its in - house developers may be struggling to solve the problems			1
a source told the paper that @entity1 started ' hiring aggressively ' in recent weeks , which suggests that the smartwatch is nowhere near being ready for release and could be pushed back to next year			1
@entity1 is said to be hiring outside help to tackle design flaws with its @entity4 , pictured			1
according to the @entity7 , the firm only began hiring in recent weeks suggesting the wearable tech wo n't be ready until 2014			1
this image is an artist 's impression of how the device could look and work speculation around @entity1 's @entity4 - the wearable technology that can connect to smartphones and display texts , @entity30 notifications and more on a device on the wearer 's wrist - began at the end of last year			1
@entity35 websites reported in december that the computer giant was working with chip - maker @entity37 on a wrist - worn gadget			2
it is thought to have a 1.5inch screen and use @entity41 to communicate with other devices , including an @entity43			0
other rumours suggest that the @entity4 will feature @entity46 voice control to let users dictate messages , rather than use the tiny screen			2
the screen could switch on when a user flicks their wrist			0
it would connect to an iphone via @entity41 meaning wearers could see messages and access menus without getting their phone from their pocket			0
the @entity4 could also be @entity63 enabled and show tweets , weather and be able to download apps			2
the watch could also be as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video , on the phone or tablet			0
the @entity4 would be a move away from @entity1 's current @entity43 , @entity74 and @entity76 products and one source told the ft that the device involves ' hard engineering problems that they [ in - house staff ] have not been able to solve '			1
@entity1 is believed to have started ' seeking out acquisitions of early - stage start - ups working on connected devices			1
' a senior member of the @entity4 team , who recently considered leaving the company , decided to stay after being given a pay rise , one source told the @entity7 the ft even claims that @entity89 , @entity1 's chief executive , could still decide to shelve the product			1
@entity91 , the ceo of @entity92 that makes flexible displays like the one rumoured for the @entity4 , told @entity94 he is n't surprised @entity1 is seeking outside help : ' in order to make a smart watch and use the whole surface ( not just the face ) , there needs to be the ability to make a display which can be completely bent around the wrist and remain robust enough to be able to frequently put it on and take it off			1
' as the market for wearable technology grows , the search for specialised talent will also intensify			0

patent applications published in march suggested that @entity1 was working on a device with a bendy strap that could be snapped onto a wearer 's wrist , and would have a flexible display			2
similar devices are already on the market , including the @entity132 that launched from a successful @entity134 campaign , and the @entity136 device developed by @entity138 college students			0
@entity1 is believed to have 100 people working on its @entity4 , according to recent rumours , but is hiring new members because the existing team have been unable to solve issues with the design and engineering			1
here is @entity148 's mockup of what the @entity4 could look like @entity150 announced earlier this month it is ' investing heavily ' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health			2
@entity150 's watch concept , pictured , shows a solid wooden band , and the watch face can be simply slipped out and put in a pocket when running , for example @entity150 announced earlier this month that it , too , is ' investing heavily ' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health			0
‘ eventually you wo n’t even know you ’re wearing the device , it could be the fabric in your clothing , your glasses or your watch , ’ @entity150 ’s chief strategy officer , @entity167 , told the @entity169 conference in @entity170 at the start of july			0
as well as the @entity4 , @entity1 is rumoured to be working on a plastic version of its @entity43 , pictured , according to images leaked on a @entity35 site if the @entity7 's sources are to be believed and @entity1 has only just begun hiring development support , the release date of the @entity4 could be pushed back to 2014 - previous reports expected the device to be announced later this year			1
during april 's earnings call , mr @entity89 said : ' our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware , software and services that we ca n't wait to introduce this fall			0
' aside from the @entity4 , @entity1 is also thought to be working on a low - cost colourful @entity192 , as well as the follow - up to the @entity43 - dubbed @entity194			1
and earlier this month , @entity196 magazine claimed that one , or possibly both , of these products will be launched in september			0
the new , cheaper handset could be made of plastic to keep costs down and may be sold in a range of colours including white , black , pink and blue			0
the new @entity194 model is believed to look identical to the current @entity43 but includes a faster processor and updated camera			0
it will also run @entity209 7 , the major new version of @entity1 's @entity74 and @entity43 software launched last month			2
both handsets could be released in time for the @entity209 roll out in october			0
@entity1 recently hired @entity212 , from @entity213 , to work on undefined ' special projects '			2
the @entity7 continued that @entity212 may have been brought in to use his experience in fashion and luxury goods to help develop the branding for the @entity4			2
after @entity35 sites began reporting on the @entity4 rumours in december , a number of designers created realistic concept images in a bid to predict what it would look like			2
this concept was by @entity228 designer @entity227 a @entity230 patent in february detailing @entity1 's plans for an @entity4 followed an earlier application to the @entity233 in 2011			1
this image , taken from the @entity236 patent application describes a ' wearable accessory device ' which mounts a touchscreen on the user 's wrist using the same technology as a slap wrap a patent application filed by @entity1 in february revealed that its @entity4 could use the same technology as a child 's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user 's wrist			1
later that month a number of designers from @entity250 , @entity170 and @entity228 - among others - began creating mock - ups of what the watch could look like			0
these included glass and coloured straps with digital , touchscreen faces			0
in march , @entity148 magazine designed a mock - up of what the watch could look like and its version contained a small screen - similar to the @entity266 - would be mounted to a traditional leather strap			0
@entity89 then fuelled the rumours further by telling the @entity270 conference in june that wearable tech was an area ' ripe for exploration ' and ' incredibly interesting '			1
@entity1 has not made any official comment about the @entity4 or the news reported by the @entity7 @entity250 designer @entity277 's rendition of the @entity4			1
the device is expected to connect to an @entity43 via @entity41 meaning wearers could see messages and access menus without getting their phone from their pocket			0
the @entity4 could also be @entity63 enabled and show tweets , weather and be able to download apps			2

@entity1 believed to be ' aggressively ' hiring people to work on its @entity4
in - house developers thought to be struggling with the wearable tech
this could push the @entity4 release date back until 2014
