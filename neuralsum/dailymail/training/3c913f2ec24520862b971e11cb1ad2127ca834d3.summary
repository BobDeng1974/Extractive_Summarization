@entity0 believes @entity1 will sell him ' for the right price ' and not stand in the way of his dream to play in the @entity5 after intense interest in the summer came to nothing			1
the striker was linked with the likes of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 in the summer after a stand - out 2013 - 14 campaign but despite strong interest after his 27 - goal season he remains at the @entity16			1
while insisting he is happy in the south of @entity18 , and reports that he is close to signing at least a one - year extension to his contract taking him up to 2018 at the club , @entity0 is open to a move			2
if they get the right price for me i think they will sell			0
i 'm sure the fans will understand			2
' @entity0 scored in the @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity5 and @entity36 for the @entity37 , and twice for @entity38 at the @entity39 , but the absence of the @entity5 on that list is a frustration he is not shy of noting			1
' for sure , i want to play in that , ' he as @entity1 prepare to host one of his potential suitors , @entity10			1
@entity0 , shoots under pressure from @entity48 's @entity47 , has four goals from 12 appearances this season ' yes , one day i would love to play in the @entity5			0
that is what i am fighting for in my career			0
' on the summer speculation @entity0 says he had to remain professional and focussed on his job at @entity1 , and wait to see how things played out			2
and after no deal eventuated he pledged his allegiance to his club			0
' i love it here at @entity1 , ' he says			0
' if you score goals , always the bigger teams will look at you			0
what i want to do now is to do better than last season			0
' @entity0 ( right ) attracted interest from big clubs including @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 @entity0 has n't managed last year 's form to date for @entity70 's seventh - placed side , with just four goals in 12 appearances this season , including a double against @entity75 last month			1
it took until his eighth match of the campaign to open his account with the 17th - minute opener in a 2 - 2 draw with @entity83			0
given their 17 - year run in the top flight of @entity87 competition , @entity10 would have be an attractive option for the @entity38 before the arrival of in - form @entity91 and @entity92 from @entity93			1
@entity0 scored when the sides last met in march for a 2 - 2 draw			2
the @entity38 striker celebrates after scoring in march 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity10 , who @entity1 face on sunday			1
