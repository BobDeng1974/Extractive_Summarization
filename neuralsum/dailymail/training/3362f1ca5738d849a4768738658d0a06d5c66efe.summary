by @entity0 an archivist has unearthed a long - lost letter written to president @entity3 in 1939 by a @entity5 stockbroker asking the @entity6 to help @entity8 children escape the @entity9			1
@entity10 , who ended up saving 669 children - many of them @entity13 - on the eve of @entity15 , later received a letter saying that @entity6 immigration laws meant that nothing could be done			1
@entity10 , now 104 , mentioned the letter in an interview with @entity21 and when it aired , @entity22 , an archivist at the @entity23 , went searching for the note , which had not been seen in 75 years			1
' and lo and behold , i came up with his original letter to president @entity3 , ' @entity22 told @entity21			1
it asks the @entity6 for help granting refuge to @entity39 children plea : it is signed by @entity10 - then a young @entity5 stockbroker who made it his mission to save children the letter , which is dated may 16th , 1939 , writes to president @entity3 , calling him ' @entity47 '			1
' perhaps people in @entity6 do not realize how little is being and has been done for refugee children in @entity50 , ' the letter says			1
' is it possible for anything to be done to help us with this problem in @entity6 ? ... it is hard to state our case forcibly in a letter , but we trust to your imagination to realize how desperately urgent the situation is			1
' the archives also revealed internal letters about the request			0
they show that the @entity66 was asked for action before it was sent to the president 's @entity68 on political refugees			1
discovery : archivist @entity22 looked for the letter after seeing @entity10 's story on @entity21 questions : archives show that the letter was passed on to @entity6 officials for a decision on what to do inquiries : the archivist found a letter to the president 's @entity68 on political refugees but ultimately , @entity10 received a letter that the @entity6 was ' unable , in the absence of specific legislation , to permit immigration in excess of that provided for by existing immigration laws '			1
unassuming : @entity10 was 29 when he went to @entity93 and made a list of children to be saved speaking on @entity21 , @entity10 said : ' the @entity6 would n't take any [ children ] , which was a pity			1
we could 've got a lot more out			0
' but he still helped 669 children escape from certain death - a heroic feat that he kept quiet for decades			1
and he said that he did n't loiter on the response from the @entity6 ' we had not much time for negative attitudes , ' he explained			2
it was 1938 and violence was escalating against @entity13 people in @entity31 when @entity10 , then just 29 , traveled to @entity93 on his work vacation			1
as the @entity9 marched into @entity50 , @entity111 - who had no experience or connections in this sort of work - decided that he would see if he could save people			2
he had actually booked a vacation to go skiing in @entity120 , but changed his plans at the last minute when a friend involved in @entity13 refugee work asked him for help			2
' all i knew was that the people that i met could n't get out , ' @entity10 , who was born to @entity126 parents in @entity5 , told @entity21 ' 60 minutes in a special interview			1
' and they were looking of ways of at least getting their children out ... i work on the motto that if something 's not impossible , there must be a way of doing it			2
' he set up shop in the city and people soon started coming to him , forcing him to work late into the night , historian @entity138 told @entity21			2
rescuer : @entity143 , pictured in @entity93 in 1938 with a young boy , kept his involvement quiet for 50 years esteemed sir , perhaps people in @entity6 do not realize how little is being and has been done for refugee children in @entity50			1
they have to depend entirely on private guarantors to get into @entity150 , which means that somebody has to take full responsibility for maintenance , upkeep , and education , until they are 18 years of age			0
no other country is taking an interest in them except for @entity161 , which took 35 children last february			0
we at this office have case - papers and photos of over 5000 children , quite apart from a further 10,000 whom we estimate have to register			2
actually , so far , we have brought only about 120 into @entity150			0
in @entity170 and @entity171 today , there are thousands of children , some homeless and starving , mostly without nationality , but they certainly all have one thing in common : there is no future , if they are forced to remain where they are			0
their parents are forbidden work and the children are forbidden schooling , and apart from the physical discomforts , which all this signifies , the moral degradation is immeasurable			2
yet since @entity189 , hardly anything has been done for the children in @entity50			0
many of the children are quite destitute having had to move more than once since they originally fled from @entity194			0
is it possible for anything to be done to help us with this problem in @entity6 ? it is hard to state our case forcibly in a letter , but we trust to your imagination to realize how desperately urgent the situation is			1
believe me , esteemed sir , with many thanks , your obedient servant , @entity10			2
when he returned to @entity5 , he had lists of hundreds of children and got to task convincing the @entity213 authorities to take them			1
he pretended to be more official than he was by taking stationery from an established refugee organization , adding ' @entity216 ' to its header and making himself chairman , @entity21 reported			1
he admitted it took ' a little smoke and mirrors ' to convince authorities to believe him - but he said it mostly took getting a printing press to print the paper			0
he continued his work as a stockbroker by day , before returning to the office to work on getting the children to the @entity213			1
his mother and volunteers also helped at the office			0
he said he contacted @entity6 authorities to take the children , but they said they were unable			1
but @entity213 authorities said they would take them if @entity10 found each one a home , so he got to work advertising their pictures so that families would take them			1
when he had secured them homes , the youngsters were ready to leave - but he found that the @entity213 authorities were slow to issue their travel documents			1
desperate to help the children get out , he forged their documents and also paid off officials , he said			1
' took a bit of blackmail on my part , ' he admitted			0
that 's the main thing			0
' the first children left @entity93 on march 14 , 1939 - just hours before @entity194 troops occupied @entity93			1
eventually , seven trains carried more than 600 children to @entity257 , where they caught ferries to @entity150			0
the @entity9 allowed them to leave , happy that the country was being ' cleansed ' of @entity13			0
another train was scheduled to leave on september 1 , but was stopped by the declaration of war			0
@entity10 said he has reason to suspect not many of those children survived			1
one of the children who did escape , @entity266 , recounted the moment he was put on a train by his parents			2
saved : among the children saved were 14 - year - old @entity271 , left , and 10 - year - old @entity266 , right thankful : @entity271 , who now lives in @entity272 , @entity273 , said she only heard @entity10 's name after 50 years survivor : @entity266 said he was always hopeful that he would return home and find his parents ' i remember that they told us that we were going to @entity150 maybe two or three months , ' he said			1
' it would be a holiday for us			0
and that they would join us very shortly thereafter ... ' but his parents never came for him , and their names are now painted on the walls of @entity93 's @entity285 , where every @entity8 jew who was murdered in the @entity287 is remembered			1
also among the children was 14 - year - old @entity271 , now 88 and living in @entity272 , @entity273			2
she recounted her mother handing her items , including a delicate , embroidered nightgown , to take on the train when she left for @entity150			0
she never saw her parents again			0
' many survivors feel guilty for having survived - i feel very grateful to my parents , ' she said			2
' our parents ' courage , i think , is the most important because most people said , " we will go together or not at all "			0
' after the war , @entity10 trained pilots for the @entity303 , married , raised a family and lived comfortably			2
he cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly			0
after the war , @entity10 married , cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly recognized : he was knighted by @entity310 in 2002 ( pictured ) and has been the subject of a film			2
next month , his daughter is releasing a book about her father but he hardly told anyone about what he had done			0
' i did n't really keep it secret , ' he told @entity21			2
' i just did n't talk about it			0
' but in 1988 , his wife @entity320 found a scrapbook in their attic listing the names of the children , their parents and the families that had taken them			1
later that year , the @entity329 learned about the story and he went on a show , where he met scores of the children he had saved			1
in 2002 , he was knighted , and he was also celebrated in a documentary called ' @entity337 '			0
next month , his daughter is releasing a book about her father			0
but he does n't care for the attention			0
' i 'm not interested in the past , ' he said			0
' i think there 's too much emphasis nowadays on the past and what has happened			0
and nobody is concentrated on the present and the future			0
' see below for video			0

@entity10 , then 29 , spent his 2 weeks vacation in 1938 traveling to @entity93 and he left with a list of the names of hundreds of children
after forging documents and *bribing* officials , he saved 669 children - many of whose parents died in concentration camps
in 1939 , he wrote to president @entity3 asking if there was anything the @entity6 could do - but an official responded saying they could not help
an archivist saw his story on @entity21 and has now found the original letter
@entity10 kept his story quiet for nearly 50 years before featuring on a @entity213 tv show and even the children did not know he had saved them
