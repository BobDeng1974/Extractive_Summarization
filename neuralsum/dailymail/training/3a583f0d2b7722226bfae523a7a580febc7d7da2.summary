boasting seven decks , two pools , multiple hot tubs and a 275 square metre master suite , a new record - breaking superyacht is set to redefine the limits of luxury boat building			1
costing £ 788million to build and measuring 222 metres in length , when completed @entity7 will be the most expensive and largest superyacht ever constructed			1
the luxury boat will surpass the remarkable standards set by @entity14 owner @entity13 's @entity12 , and the current record - holding 182 metres - long yacht owned by the president of the @entity17			1
although the identity of its owner remains a mystery , it is due to be completed in 2018 and is being purposely made 40m larger than the current record - holder in order to be difficult to beaten in size			1
reports suggest that despite its size , the luxury private yacht will only carry 36 guests with a crew of around 50 - 70 people			0
the owner 's suite will cover two stories across 275 metres - squared and offer unparalleled views , along with a private gym , office and dining room , according to @entity59			2
it will also have two staterooms , an exclusive elevator drive in dock and private access to a helipad			0
guests will be entitled to use the yacht 's outdoor and indoor pool , numerous hot tubs , spa facilities as well as a full time masseuse and hairdresser			0
@entity7 's top speed will be over 30 knots ( 35mph ) and will be powered by triple gas turbine engines with over 100,000 horsepower			0
the vessel also has no rudders and will instead use electric podded propulsion units to manoeuvre			0
this graphic reveals the current standings of superyachts owned by the world 's megarich @entity83 of @entity20 , the broker of the building project , said its owner was motivated by boasting rights and construction , at an as yet undecided @entity88 shipyard , is expected to begin within the next 12 months			1
he also said that the building work will take two to three million hours to build and bring in employment opportunities for 500 people for a period of three years			0
' it 's just like the competition to build the world 's tallest building			2
' our client was concerned that if we built the yacht to 220m , then someone would come along like @entity13 when he built @entity101 at 163.5m , and outdid @entity103 's yacht , the 162m @entity104 , by only 1.5m			0
' by building the yacht to 222m , the owner wants to make it difficult , if not impossible , to be " eclipsed " himself			2
' @entity13 's yacht was completed in december 2010 and is the world 's third largest superyacht			1
it requires 70 crew members to operate and features two helicopter pads , three launch boats and a mini-submarine			0
when built , it took the title of world 's biggest private yacht from the @entity104			2
this had taken the crown from the 138m @entity123 , owned at the time by @entity126 businessman @entity125 , which in turn took over from the @entity129 , owned by @entity131 co-founder @entity130			0
however , @entity13 's reign as the owner of the world 's largest superyacht was short lived - in 2013 , the @entity17 royal family knocked it off its perch with @entity25 , which exceeded it in length by 16.5m			1
at the time it was predicted - quite accurately - that this would trigger a new round of one - upmanship among the world 's super rich			1
longer than 12 double - decker buses , not only is @entity25 the biggest superyacht , it is also one of the fastest			2
the 94,000 horsepower vessel can reach speeds of more than 30 knots , or 35mph			0
@entity14 owner @entity13 's @entity101 ( pictured ) will also be dwarfed by the new boat @entity131 founder @entity130 's @entity152 ( pictured ) was once the world 's largest yacht , measuring 126m in length			1

the world 's largest yacht , measuring 222m , is due to be completed by 2018
it will eclipse the president of @entity17 's boat @entity25 by a *whopping* 40 metres
record breaking yacht will boast seven decks , two pools and cost £ 788m
the massive boat is the *latest* salvo in megarich 's game of one - upmanship
owners hope the boat will be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to beat
