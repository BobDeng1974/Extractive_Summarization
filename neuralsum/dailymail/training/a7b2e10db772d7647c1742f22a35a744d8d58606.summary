a few words in @entity1 , a quick kiss of the badge and @entity4 had sidestepped the first challenge of his new life as the world ’s most expensive footballer			1
what a day it was for @entity4			2
it did feel slightly surreal , he confessed , to find himself juggling a football in the sunshine before an estimated 30,000 @entity15 fans			1
like a prisoner released from nearly 100 days of transfer talks he emerged blinking and testing his limbs to see if they still did what they did before			2
@entity27 ceremony : @entity4 performed kick - ups in the centre circle in front of an adoring crowd kissing the badge : @entity4 wasted no time in showing his affection for his new club at the @entity25 the @entity35 had flocked to the @entity36 to witness the official unveiling of their newest @entity38 , the man who had cost £ 86million , more than @entity40			1
what on earth would such a footballer look like ? well , he looked clean - cut in his skinny black suit and pencil - thin black tie , brimming with emotion as he was introduced by @entity15 president @entity47			1
after one of at least four costume changes , he appeared truly proud to step on to the pitch in the pristine white kit of his new team and his bright yellow adidas boots			2
the keepy - uppies , to be honest , left a little to be desired — ‘ i was very nervous , ’ he said — but the football comes later			2
real fans will soon appreciate what @entity4 the footballer does well and it is n’t keepy - uppies			1
it 's all kicking off : @entity4 boots footballs into the crowd during his unveiling family affair : @entity4 's relatives join in with proceedings inside the stadium on monday afternoon yesterday , the skill of the boy from @entity72 was to sprinkle some of his humble charm upon his new followers			1
he did n’t venture far into his new language but far enough to make an impression			0
in @entity1 , @entity4 said : ‘ hello , this is a dream			1
thank you for this great welcome			0
’ his ‘ @entity83 ’ finish was particularly well received , his beaming smile was effortless and he seemed happier when asked to drop kick footballs into the steep tiers of the stands or lash the ball into an empty goal to oblige photographers			0
when he pulled up the front of his shirt and gave the @entity15 crest a smacker , it drew the biggest cheer of the day			1
‘ @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , ’ the fans chanted			2
they briefly sang the names of @entity101 — the playmaker on his way to @entity104 after the arrival of @entity4 — and @entity106 — the out - of - favour goalkeeping legend			2
but generally the event was on message			0
pitching in : @entity4 's family join him on the @entity25 playing surface best 11 : @entity4 is presented with his shirt by @entity15 president @entity47 at the @entity25 first five fixtures v @entity115 ( a ) - sunday september 15 v @entity116 ( @entity117 ) - september 22 v @entity118 ( a ) - september 25 v @entity119 ( @entity117 ) - september 29 v @entity120 ( @entity117 ) - october 2 first @entity121 v @entity122 ( a ) - october 27 at times , it felt like a celebrity wedding as the dignitaries breezed in to take their seats with nods and smiles			1
they faced the stage erected last week in the hope @entity132 may be convinced to speed @entity134 ’s side of things up slightly			0
television screens showed re-runs of @entity4 ’s devastating displays for @entity134 against @entity139 , the @entity141 ties which launched the @entity142 into a different orbit in 2010			2
the @entity15 board arrived , suited and serious behind shades			2
among their number were former players @entity147 and @entity149			0
then came @entity4 ’s family , including his parents and his childhood sweetheart , @entity152 , with their 11 - month - old daughter @entity153			1
pitch perfect : the £ 86million @entity142 poses for the media and supporters during his @entity25 presentation his agents , team @entity159 , managed admirably to contain their delight at pushing this one over the line			1
@entity4 appeared fashionably late to a round of applause and a sigh of relief that @entity132 had not reappeared brandishing the small print and demanding a few euros more			2
negotiations were ‘ intense ’ and ‘ complex ’ , said @entity47 with diplomacy , and @entity4 , when asked , neatly swerved the question about the @entity134 question			1
all in the past , he insisted			0
in the present , @entity4 pulled on a set of cheap headphones to listen to the translation as @entity47 took the stage before two giant photographs			1
one showed @entity4 in action for @entity182 , the other of him as a boy , aged about 12 , wearing a @entity15 shirt from the @entity187 era and making a peace symbol with two fingers			1
here was the centre point of the script			0
@entity4 supported @entity15 as a boy			1
not quite real duvets and curtains in @entity195 but he slept in this shirt and dreamed of playing for them			0
welcome to @entity15 : @entity4 arrives in the stands to a rapturuous applause from the @entity15 supporters the only way is up : @entity4 is joining the stars at the @entity25 @entity4 to get more goals than @entity40 in @entity204 this season - 10/1 total @entity205 16.5 : 5/6 ; under 16.5 : 5/6 he referred repeatedly to them as the biggest club in the world , noted their nine @entity211 titles and called @entity40 the best player in the world , airbrushing @entity214 from the picture for effect			1
this was not lost on his audience			0
when @entity219 arrived at @entity122 earlier this summer , he had done precisely the same in reverse ; hailing @entity214 and ignoring @entity40			0
that ’s all part of the politics where these two rivals are concerned			0
everyone took care to tiptoe around the world - record transfer fee			0
it is advertised as £ 78m by @entity15 rather than £ 86m to satisfy @entity40 ’s ego			2
again , it ’s all part of the politics and , if @entity4 was still in any doubt that he was embarking on an adventure into a different dimension , then @entity47 gave it to him straight			1
@entity15 magician : @entity4 shows off his silky skills to the @entity15 fans in the @entity25 ‘ you are now in the most demanding club in the world but we will always be by your side , ’ said @entity47			1
‘ challenges are constant , even after victory , but never forget the energy of this stadium will be your ally			0
many great players have played here and you will be one of their heirs			0
‘ @entity4 , this is your stadium , this is your shirt , this is your pitch and these are your fans			1
from now on this is your home			0
‘ welcome to your team			0
who can blame him ? it is a long way from the @entity262 — or @entity264 ’s @entity263 for that matter			0
it is a big step from @entity134 , too , for a 24 - year - old			0
@entity268 needed time to adjust and he did not carry the label of the world ’s most expensive footballer			0
adoring fans : @entity4 walked around the perimeter of the pitch kicking balls into the crowd selling point : there are plenty of @entity4 shirts on sale in the @entity15 club shop from the moment of his debut , expected to be away at @entity115 a week on sunday , @entity4 will stand direct comparison to @entity40 and the @entity122 pair of @entity214 and @entity219			1
the next time he steps out in public on to the @entity25 turf , against @entity116 a week later , he will be judged by these people as a footballer			0
not only that , he will be judged as the world ’s most expensive footballer ; someone who banks £ 12m a year			0
nerves will not be an amusing excuse			0
he will not be @entity4 the polite , well - mannered and self - effacing homeboy from @entity72 , prepared to risk a few words of @entity1 in a public arena			1
he will be @entity4 the @entity38 , expected to win the @entity141			2
all hail @entity4 : the @entity35 go wild at their new star 's unveiling @entity300 undergoing his @entity15 medical			1

forward speaks @entity1 and kisses the @entity15 badge
@entity4 calls move ' a dream come true ' before doing keep ups on pitch
family join in the unveiling with @entity15 president @entity47
fans cheer him but chant his name as ' @entity318 '
@entity159 *signing* will join @entity182 over the weekend for @entity322 *qualifier*
