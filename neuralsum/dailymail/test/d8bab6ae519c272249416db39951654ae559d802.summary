the pictures show a caring sister helping her brother with his coat , giving him a kiss , and tenderly holding his hand as they play together			2
but while the scene looks idyllic , it is tinged with sadness , as @entity10 has a muscle wasting disease meaning he will eventually be left in a wheelchair and his life will be cut short			1
the three - year - old , from @entity16 , was diagnosed with @entity17 just six months ago after his parents , @entity18 , 33 , and @entity19 , 36 , noticed he was struggling to develop and learn to walk			1
they were left devastated when tests confirmed their son had the incurable condition and that is likely only to live to the age of 20			2
now , they have decided to make his short life as full of joy as possible			1
@entity10 , five , was diagnosed with @entity17 six months ago , meaning his muscles will slowly waste away			1
his sister @entity32 , five , adores him and cares for him as much as possible @entity10 will eventually need a wheelchair and has a life expectancy of just 20			1
@entity32 plays only ' muscle friendly ' games that wo n't tire her brother out - and refuses to play games at school unless @entity10 can join in @entity32 makes sure her brother is thoroughly looked after - she helps him put on his shoes , fasten up his coat ( left ) , fetches his cereal in the morning and plays with him in the garden ( right ) thankfully @entity10 's big sister , @entity32 , five , adores her brother and makes sure he is thoroughly looked after - she helps him put on his shoes , fasten up his coat and even helps fetch him his cereals in the morning			1
mrs @entity45 said : ' we were heart broken when we discovered that @entity10 had such an awful terminal disease			1
' we told @entity32 as soon as @entity10 was diagnosed that he had a problem with his muscles and that they 're weaker than normal			1
' it was important she understood so they could play games that would n't tire him such as playing with toys and painting			0
' we 've told them both that the doctors are trying to find a medicine to help			0
' she now only plays " muscle friendly " games that do n't involve @entity10 running around and getting extremely tired			1
' @entity32 loves her little brother so much and she even takes care of him when they are both at school as they share break times together			1
duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness			0
it usually only affects boys ( around one in 3,500 ) , although girls can carry the defective gene			0
although not apparent at birth symptoms appear in early childhood			0
boys with @entity17 's will have difficulty with walking , jumping and climbing stairs			1
the disorder is diagnosed via a blood test and muscle tissue sample			0
sufferers are likely to need increasing help and treatments from the age of nine			0
walking becomes difficult and a wheelchair is usually needed by the age of 12			2
as patients go through their teenage years they are more likely to suffer from complications such as chest infections			0
most most people with @entity93 survive well into their 20s and sometimes longer			0
the eventual cause of death is usually a severe chest infection at the stage when lung function is already poor			0
' she openly tells their friends that she wo n't join in with any games unless @entity10 can keep up too			1
' it 's such a relief knowing that she 's keeping an eye on him when i 'm not around			0
' mr and mrs @entity45 found out their son @entity10 had @entity17 just before his third birthday last year			1
the condition affects around one in 3,500 and causes difficulties with movement , meaning a wheelchair is normally needed by the age of 12			2
mrs @entity45 said she hopes there will be a scientific breakthrough before that point			0
she said : ' his only hope is that researchers have a breakthrough in time to save him and the hundreds of other boys who have this terrible disease			0
' @entity10 will lose the use of his legs first , leaving him wheelchair - bound , and then other muscles thereafter			1
eventually , his heart and lungs will fail			0
at first @entity10 's parents thought he was a late developer but when at six months he could n't sit and by two he could n't walk they knew something was seriously wrong			1
mrs @entity45 said : ' results from the blood test in july said he had muscle dystrophy , but it was n't until the end of september , after more tests , that we found out it was @entity17			1
' the disease , which results in muscle degeneration , has already left @entity10 unable to get up the stairs or walk long distances			1
mrs @entity45 added : ' @entity10 struggles to stand up and despite only being three he looks like a little old man when he tries to get up			1
' it 's an awful illness but we are going to ensure that @entity10 has the best life and with @entity32 's help we know he 'll enjoy every second			1
' @entity32 will often clear away both of their toys so that her little brother does n't get too tired			2
' she will help him put on his shoes , fasten his coat and even helps him with his cereals in the morning			0
' when i tell them both to tidy up their toys @entity32 will instantly stick up for him and say " what about his weak muscles "			1
@entity45 , 33 , and her husband @entity19 , 36 , realised there was something wrong with their son when @entity10 was n't developing properly			2
the family have now decided to make @entity10 's short life full of joy as well as playing with her brother at home , @entity32 looks after @entity10 at school , spending break times with him ' it 's adorable but he 's so spoilt			1
' @entity17 occurs mainly in boys and although it can be inherited it often occurs with no known family history of the condition			2
mrs @entity45 said this was the case for her and her husband , so they were shocked when @entity10 was diagnosed			2
she said : ' we have no family history of the condition so it has been such a shock for us to come to terms with but that 's why we 've set up the @entity191 appeal			0
' the family have set up at online fundraising website to ensure @entity10 he gets the specialist treatment he needs to make his life as comfortable as possible			1
' we need funds to help @entity10 be as independent as possible when he grows up and so we can adapt our home , ' mrs @entity45 explained			1
' when he 's older we will need a special hoist and a bedroom and wet room downstairs			0
' until then , the family are focusing on creating as many memories as possible with @entity10 while he has some muscle function			2
mrs @entity45 said : ' thanks to @entity32 , @entity10 has a constant play mate and she helps him ensure he gets the most out of the time he has being able to move his muscles			1
' there is n't any medication @entity10 can take that will slow down his muscle deterioration so we have to watch helplessly as he slowly becomes weaker			1
' but we 're trying to keep positive and with the help of @entity32 we are getting through it as a family			2
' there is no cure for @entity17 's , nor any medication that can slow his muscle deterioration			2
but thanks to @entity32 , @entity10 has a constant playmate often @entity32 will clear up @entity10 's toys after they have played together so he does n't become to fatigued			1
