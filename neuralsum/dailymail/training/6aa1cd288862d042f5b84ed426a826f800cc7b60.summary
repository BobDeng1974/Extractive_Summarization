@entity0 will be looking to prove he is up there with all the great @entity3 no 10s down the years - even @entity4 - by inspiring his side again over dangerous @entity6			1
how better to weave his name into the pantheon of greats than with a special ‘ @entity11 ’ free kick ? many of the most enduring memories of @entity14 have been stunning goals from free kicks , not least by @entity11			0
but so far we ’ve not seen a direct set piece fly in from 20 taken , whereas in last season ’s @entity20 one in 12 hit the back of the net			0
the time is now : @entity0 has the opportunity to put himself up there as one of @entity3 's greatest ever no 10s come alive : @entity0 scored for the host nation during their opening win against @entity31 last week @entity32 highlights his brilliance @entity0 to score a hat - trick against @entity6 is at 10/1			1
click here to place your bet with @entity38			0
former @entity40 boss @entity39 leads @entity41 into their campaign against @entity44 as the only nation at the finals who do n’t have any players playing outside their country			1
meanwhile , @entity50 kick off their tournament against @entity53 as dark horse contenders for many			1
so many of their team are familiar faces to an @entity59 audience , with @entity61 ’s @entity60 very much the jewel in the crown ; but how has this happened ? after crashing out of the 1998 finals at the group stages , the @entity50 federation came up with a blueprint for the future , written by coach @entity70			1
those at the @entity72 who strive to improve the standard of the @entity59 football ought to read it			0
a significant section is how to nurture young players			0
@entity78 is for five - seven year olds based on making football fun , learning step then encouraging dribbling and passing through progressive small - sided games up until eleven - a - side			2
it ’s when they approach 11 that players learn to operate in a 4 - 3 - 3 system			2
@entity20 class : @entity61 's @entity60 is @entity50 's talisman figure as they face @entity53 on tuesday to be feared ! @entity92 targetman @entity91 is likely to lead the line for @entity95 ' side @entity53 striker @entity96 could well test the credentials of @entity50			1
@entity99 boss @entity98 will be watching with interest			1
having been rejected again by @entity50 ’s @entity91 in an attempt to take him on loan from @entity61 , the @entity99 could make another attempt to lure @entity96 from @entity104			1
the @entity105 at the last two @entity14 has been won with five goals			0
but with @entity107 , who claimed the prize in 2010 , upping the ante to two - goal @entity0 , @entity110 and @entity111 with his opening game hat - trick it looks like the eight @entity3 ’s @entity115 hit at the 2002 finals could be challenged			1
and with such a good start , the 10 hit by @entity117 in 1970 is not impossible			2
the record 13 , which @entity121 ’s @entity120 struck in 1958 , still looks safe			0
it ’s always hard to measure the star quality of a tournament , but there is a strong case that this has been the best start to a @entity127 ever			1
certainly this is on a different planet to the drab opening of @entity131 2010 where after 12 games there had been just 20 goals			0
so far there have been 41 from 12 games - a ratio of 3.4 per game			2
that ’s the highest since 1958			0
laying down the gauntlet : @entity107 netted a hat - trick for @entity142 in their win against @entity145 fish out of water ? @entity110 netted twice for @entity148 and is one behind @entity142 's @entity107 pick that out ! @entity117 scored 10 goals for @entity142 in @entity6 at the 1970 @entity127 finals ( pictured celebrating during the quarter - final win against defending champions @entity40 ) so far the games have been so absorbing and entertaining - even the first goalless draw between @entity156 and @entity157 - that there have been few sightings of the @entity160			1
that ’s always a sure sign when fans have started to get bored with events on the pitch			0
the ripple effect ovations are credited to have started at the 1986 @entity127 finals in @entity6 , although apparently it had appeared at american football games for a few years before that			2
it first got a run out at a @entity173 in 1981 , led by @entity175 ‘ @entity174 ’ @entity176 and @entity178 director @entity177			0
@entity179 just as it seemed @entity50 would take @entity40 to penalties at the @entity183 , @entity180 sent over a cross which @entity185 converted with a stunning volley on the turn			2
in many ways it is the goal that changed the face of @entity59 football			0
swinging right foot : @entity185 scored a dramatic late winner for @entity40 against @entity50 at @entity183			1

host nation looking to build on win against @entity31 , inspired by @entity0
@entity50 start their @entity127 campaign when they face @entity44
@entity60 and @entity91 to line up for @entity50
@entity99 boss @entity98 will watch @entity53 's @entity96
@entity107 nets hat - trick for @entity142 as he bids to beat *namesake* @entity203 scored at @entity204
