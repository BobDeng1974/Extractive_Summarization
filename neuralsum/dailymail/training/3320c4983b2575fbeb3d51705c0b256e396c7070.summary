@entity65 @entity66 was a key figure in @entity69 's bid to host the @entity70 and was installed as director of sport for the dual event , the first woman to hold such a post			1

@entity92 and @entity93 within @entity0 's own sport , @entity95 - born @entity94 was @entity4 's first female team principal when she succeeded former @entity98 chief @entity97 in october 2012 , and has been an outspoken voice in the discussion over the future of some of the lesser marques			1

' perhaps if i controlled the board i would probably say it would n't be a bad idea to have a woman being the chief executive			1
' if i died there are enough people in the company who could continue running it the way we have set things up			0
' would they ( @entity37 ) want a front guy ? particularly if they run an ipo ( float the sport on the @entity155 ) then the @entity120 would want to see someone i suppose and the right person would come along			0
' it is all a far cry to his comments in 2005 shortly after the @entity162 ' top female motorsports star @entity161 had just finished fourth in the @entity163			0
@entity0 remarked at the time : ' you know i 've got one of those wonderful ideas ... women should be dressed in white like all the other domestic appliances			2

i have been able to keep my focus			0
' after relinquishing numerous board positions to concentrate on the case , as of monday this week @entity0 was reinstated			2
as far as @entity0 is concerned , he still has plenty to offer as he said : ' i 'm happy here as long as the board are happy			2

' i still enjoy what i do			0
the good thing is every day i get up and i never know what is going to happen			0
it keeps me on my toes			0
' asked as to whether he felt he was still needed , @entity0 replied : ' i 've a little bit of experience			2
' i 'm in a good position with people who trust me , rely on me , i shake hands with them and they do n't need a contract			0
they know that 's it , the end of it			0
' the only thing is it takes an awful long time to develop that sort of reputation , and whoever does what i do it will take an awful long time for them to achieve that i suppose			0
' a fresh face @entity0 will have to contend with is a new chairman of @entity4 with former @entity217 ceo @entity216 due to step down because of ill health			1
