three hundred league games and three goals to celebrate – @entity2 marked a landmark appearance by scoring the treble that sunk @entity5 and moved @entity6 back to to within a point of @entity8 at the top of @entity10			1
in those 300 league matches the 27 - year - old @entity13 has now scored 269 @entity10 goals			2
it was also the 23rd time he had scored three in one game drawing him level with @entity18 as the player with the most hat - tricks in the domestic competition			2
the @entity13 was the star once again but @entity24 's over-head volley was the goal of the game			2
he climbed off the bench in the second half to complete the perfect afternoon for @entity6			2
@entity29 also scored and with @entity30 just 10 days away @entity6 have top form winning their last 11 games			1
@entity2 scores his hat trick during an impressive performance in @entity6 's 5 - 0 win over @entity5 the @entity13 ( left ) was superb throughout and scored his fifth @entity10 hat trick of the season @entity24 scored a wonderful bicycle kick after coming off the bench for @entity42 's side they started strongly with @entity44 playing in @entity45 but the winger failed to finish			1
@entity5 had their first chance when @entity48 shot on five minutes but it was largely one - way traffic from then on in with @entity6 failing to take their chances at first			2
@entity2 and @entity52 both went close before finally @entity29 put the home side ahead with one of the strangest goals he has scored so far this season			1
@entity2 crossed from the right and the @entity58 miss - hit his volley but as he sliced it the @entity5 keeper @entity60 was caught off his line and it sailed over his head and into the back of the net			0
it was yet another @entity2 assist for @entity29 who is even scoring them this season when he fails to catch them cleanly			1
the dynamic duo of the @entity71 was too much for @entity5 who could n't handle the skill or pace @entity29 celebrates after scoring the opening goal for @entity6 during their convincing 5 - 0 win over @entity5 @entity2 had his assist now he needed a goal			1
he should have been awarded a free - kick on the edge of the area when @entity81 deliberately backed into him and flattened him but the referee did n't see it			0
@entity2 then shot weakly at @entity60 after being put through by @entity52			0
he was getting closer though and on 39 minutes the goal came			0
it was his finish but it owed much to @entity88 's midfield steal and pass			0
it should have been 3 - 0 before the break when @entity90 crossed from the left			0
@entity45 missed the first attempt , @entity29 flicked the ball to @entity2 but he blasted over the bar			1
@entity2 ( centre ) slots home his first of the game past the on rushing @entity97 at the @entity98 @entity29 and @entity2 dazzled throughout as @entity5 had no answer to the slick , total football of @entity6 @entity101 : @entity102 ; @entity103 , @entity88 , @entity104 , @entity90 ; @entity44 , @entity105 , @entity106 ( @entity107 -62 ) ; @entity45 , @entity2 , @entity29 ( @entity24 - 67 ) @entity101 subs : ter @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , goals : @entity29 17 , @entity2 38 , 59 , 65 ( p ) , @entity24 73 booked : @entity116 @entity117 : @entity118 ; @entity119 ( @entity120 ) , @entity81 , @entity121 , @entity122 ; @entity123 ( @entity124 ) , @entity125 ; @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 ; @entity129 ( @entity130 ) @entity5 subs : @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 booked : @entity121 , @entity48 @entity29 started the second half brightly but he just failed to convert @entity45 's cross and was too unselfish when through on goal playing his pass just behind @entity2 instead of finishing himself			1
he found @entity2 again moments later after a mazy run across the face of the penalty area			0
the @entity13 played in @entity45 but he failed to beat the keeper			0
@entity45 turned provider on the hour when found by @entity116 and he crossed for @entity2 to get his second of the game and @entity6 's third			1
the hat - trick came when @entity29 went down the right and was brought down by @entity119 in the area			1
this time there was no handing over the baton to @entity29			0
after the @entity58 's missed midweek spot - kick penalty - taking duties were handed back to @entity2 and he sent @entity60 the wrong way to make it 4 - 0			2
@entity2 shined as @entity6 returned to the total football which has been their label over previous years that was @entity29 's last contribution with @entity24 brought on to replace him			1
the former @entity164 striker would not have been too happy being rested such is his need to starting adding goals to his prolific assist - count but he wasted no time in getting on the scoresheet			0
@entity90 crossed from the left and the @entity170 volleyed past @entity60 with an overhead kick that got perhaps the biggest cheer of the afternoon			0
the @entity98 want him to succeed and they know a confidence - boosting goal just ahead of the return of @entity177 football can only help his cause			0
@entity2 ( right ) and @entity24 celebrate after the @entity170 scored his sides fifth with an impressive finish @entity29 ( left ) dribbles away from the oncoming @entity5 duo @entity125 and @entity48 at the @entity98 @entity6 celebrate after @entity2 scores his second goal after a neat passage of play involving @entity45			1
