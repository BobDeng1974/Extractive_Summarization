@entity1 's ' most hated ' airline has cheerfully released a report revealing what passengers despise most about their service , following a request for them to unleash their fury via social media			1
in july , @entity9 announced that it would give 8,000 air miles to any traveller who vented their anger about poor flying experiences on its or other airlines			1
it has been inundated with more than 28,000 complaints , according the report , which they have named the ' @entity19 '			2
worst offender : spirit has received the most complaints of any airlines for the past five years ' airline hate is at an all - time high , ' the airline says on its website			1
' @entity9 mess up - we 're willing to admit it , and we 're working to get better			2
' it 's not just @entity9 passengers are moaning about			2
following the announcement of the ' @entity36 ' campaign over the summer , 60 per cent of the grievances on social media have been directed at other airlines			1
the airline 's president and ceo @entity38 expressed his surprise over the findings in a statement			0
' i think if any organisation asks for feedback you would expect the vast majority of responses would be directed at the company that seeks it , but in this case we were surprised that most consumers chose to share their frustrations about other airlines , ' he said			0
seating - 20 % lost bags - 16 % delays - 15 % service - 15 % fees - 12 % cost - 7 % legroom - 7 % food and drink - 5 % boarding - 2 % cancelled flights - 1 % spirit - 40 % @entity64 - 12 % united - 10 % @entity1 - 8 % southwest - 7 % @entity65 - 5 % @entity66 - 3 % frontier - 2 % @entity67 - 2 % other - 10 % spirit was still far the worst offender , accounting for 40 per cent of online backlash , followed by @entity64 ( 12 per cent ) and @entity71 ( 10 per cent )			1
uncomfortable seating was the motivation behind 20 per cent of the online criticisms			2
lost bags was another common grievance ( 16 per cent ) , followed by delays and service ( both 15 per cent )			1
spirit was surprised to learn that they were only the worst offenders for one of these grievances : extra fees			0
its answer ? ' some people call the , fees			0
we think of them as options			0
other airlines bundle them into your fare			0
but when you fly with us , you pay only for what you use			0
' the budget airline hopes customers can learn to love their ' no frills ' approach			0
' we need to continue educating our customers about our business model , ' said @entity38			0
' our experience shows once customers understand how much money they save with our model , they like it a lot			0
' @entity9 made headlines earlier in the year when the ' @entity36 ' campaign was launched , in response to receiving more complaints than any other airlines five years in a row			1
in return for venting their anger about a bad experience on board spirit or one of their competitors , passengers were rewarded with 8,000 free air miles			1
as ever , there ’s a catch – with passengers needing 10,000 total miles to secure a free flight , or flyers can sign up for the airline ’s credit card to be able to book 2,500 - mile one - way fares			1
in april , @entity131 reported every year from 2009 - 2013 , passengers were three times as likely to have an issue with spirit than they were the second - place airline			2
the figures were calculated based on complaints - from flights and fares , to baggage and refunds – per 100,000 passengers			0
in fact , @entity9 received so many complaints , according to the the @entity1 @entity146 report , it had to be excluded from deeper analysis of on - time performance , baggage mishandling , and other issues			1
the airline also has its own ‘ boycott spirit ’ @entity154 page , and a @entity155 handle called @ hatespiritair			0
the report , which analysed consumer complaints filed with the @entity159 , said of spirit : ' two checked bags , basic meals and snacks , carry - ons , and , often , in - flight entertainment were formerly included in the price of your ticket , but now add - on fees for each of these newly a la carte items can easily add $ 100 or more to the cost of a one - way ticket			1
