by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 03:21 est , 18 march 2013 at 51 years old , @entity1 is still a svelte size 10 a sporty blonde giggles as @entity5 - like extensions are woven into her hair			1
after just an hour in make - up - most models require at least double that to be ' camera ready ' - she dons a terrifyingly small crop top to reveal her piece de resistance ; that washboard stomach			1
the woman in question is no teenage starlet , however			2
it 's splash ! star @entity1 , and those extraordinary abs are 51 years old			1
' i 'd never have had the confidence to show off my midriff in my 20s , ' says mother - of - one @entity1 , patting her stomach proudly			1
' i had the body - but i did n't have that confidence and go - get - it attitude that comes with age			1
' the tv presenter 's figure ( she 's 5ft 7in and a size 10 ) became the talking point of the nation when she appeared on @entity35 's prime - time saturday night show last month , plunging head - first from the high diving board with a host of other celebrities , under the tutelage of @entity42 athlete @entity41			1
but she had n't originally planned to wear the itsy - bitsy bikinis that caused so much public consternation			1
instead , she 'd brought along a black running vest and bikini bottoms , only to have the look vetoed by a member of the wardrobe department			2
' one of the girls came over and said : " you 've got to wear a bikini ! " i said : " really ? do you think it 'll look all right ? " and she said : " i think it will be fabulous ! " so i thought i 'd go for it			2
' incredibly , her body - clad in those skimpy rhinestone bikinis - held its own next to @entity41 's athletic 18 - year - old frame			1
' wearing a bikini on national tv at the age of 51 is the last thing i thought i 'd be doing , ' she laughs			1
but then fiftysomething mums no longer feel they have to hide their bodies away in shapeless frumpy clothes			2
last week , a survey revealed that 50 is the age most women said they felt happiest , attributing it to having more sex , enjoying better relationships and being more physically active than their younger counterparts			2
all reasons why @entity1 calls herself and her contemporaries ' the ageless generation '			2
' turning 50 has been a liberation , ' says @entity1			0
' i stood in front of the mirror on the morning of my birthday and took a long , hard look at my reflection			0
i 'd done the same thing a decade earlier - but , as a 50 - year - old , i felt so much better about myself			1
' of course , there were more lines and wrinkles than when i turned 40 , but they felt less important			0
at 50 , you lose those worries and fears about growing older			1
my generation refuse to be defined by their date of birth			0
' even 20 years ago , women turning 50 almost felt ashamed			0
that 's why everyone lied so desperately about their ages - particularly celebrities			1
you had stars who were clearly well into their late 40s still pretending to be frivolous thirtysomethings			0
' there was a real taboo about ageing then , a feeling that the only thing you could do was shop in the nylon trouser and baggy sweater section of @entity114 and wear comfortable @entity116 - fastening shoes			1
' now , the way women think and dress has been revolutionised			0
i mean , @entity120 dyed her hair pink recently ! i ca n't think of a better person who illustrates this new " bring it on " attitude			0
' born in @entity124 , @entity1 is a farmer 's daughter and one of five children			1
she studied fine art in @entity128 , where she met and dated @entity129 , a photographer			0
after graduating , @entity1 moved back to the countryside and worked as an air hostess before meeting @entity129 again , aged 26			0
three years later , in 1992 , the couple married and @entity1 's television career began 18 months afterwards			0
@entity1 with her husband @entity134 , left , and proudly showing off her flat stomach and size 10 frame , right programmes such as @entity138 and @entity139 cemented her reputation as an interior design expert , but it was n't until her bikini - clad appearance on reality show i 'm a celebrity			1
in 2003 that @entity1 was truly propelled into the public eye			0
in a @entity149 survey , three - quarters of women said they felt most insecure about wobbly stomachs she was castigated for appearing ' fame hungry ' after posing naked for glossy magazines - her modesty barely spared by strategically folded arms			1
former colleagues came out of the woodwork and accused her of having such grasping ambition she underwent a complete makeover in a bid for fame			0
' back then she was quite chunky - a good few stone heavier than she is now , ' a former colleague said at the time			1
' she always used to wear baggy tops and t - shirts			1
her hair was cut into a plain bob , and she hardly ever wore make - up			1
' @entity1 vehemently dismisses the claims and says she always took care of her appearance			0
' looking back to my 20s , i was n't frumpy or overweight , but i 'm sure there were some real fashion disasters			1
i was never heavy when i was younger , but i used to yo - yo in weight by several pounds if i 'd over-indulged			1
i 've learned over the years to keep an eye on my exercise and diet			0
' her daughter @entity179 , 20 , has left home for university and @entity1 believes life is harder for her daughter 's generation than it is for hers			1
@entity1 , aged 20 , when she said she never felt confident enough to show her midriff , despite having a typically good body she says : ' the pressure on @entity179 and her contemporaries to look a certain way is horrendous			1
whereas my peers are too old to be unduly influenced , teenagers and twentysomethings have an unprecedented amount of expectation to live up to some ideal body shape			0
' they are being bombarded with the wrong images - size - zero models with figures you have to starve yourself to achieve , for example , and all these plastic - fantastic fake celebrity looks			1
' tv programmes such as 10 years @entity205 place a huge emphasis on looks , too			1
there 's little about confidence , kindness or self - worth			1
the message is clear - be judged on your body shape and how you look			1
' but it has to be said , @entity1 - who shops at @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 ( ' the same places as my daughter ' ) - is partly making a living by trading on her good looks			1
to these ends , the presenter will soon be seen in a campaign targeting older women for lingerie firm @entity228			2
@entity1 hugs @entity229 on @entity230 so just how does @entity1 manage to maintain those abs and stay a neat size ten ? ' i do n't actually weigh myself or diet , ' she says			1
' but i have a favourite pair of tight jeans and when they do n't do up , i 'll spend a few days drinking juices and eating more healthily			0
' i 'm lucky because my body pinged back into shape after having @entity179 in my 30s			1
as the years have gone on , i 've had to work harder to maintain my shape			0
' i do yoga whenever i can - at least three times a week - which also helps me to relax , and i have a personal trainer who i see twice a week for an hour each time			2
' ( @entity1 also cycles a ten - mile round - trip to and from training sessions			2
) ' i love the rush i get after exercising , ' she says			0
' i guess you could say i 'm addicted			0
but there are worse things to be hooked on ! ' the @entity139 team , from left , @entity254 , ' @entity256 ' @entity255 , @entity1 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 although for anyone envying @entity1 's abs , she has some bad news			0
' there 's no hidden secret to getting my stomach , ' she says			0
' just go to the gym and work hard			0
' @entity1 adds : ' i plan to still wear sexy , fashionable clothes when i 'm 80			0
my mother died aged 76 from heart disease and my 86 - year - old dad is wheelchair - bound and has a raft of health problems including dementia , so he lives in a care home			1
' seeing my parents suffer from illness has been my main motivation for staying in shape			0
i do n't want to get ill. ' but @entity1 is adamant she 'd never consider cosmetic surgery			0
@entity1 showing her designs to some participants on @entity282 's @entity139 ' my husband @entity129 is , like me , horrified by older women who have had things " done "			0
' i 've stood next to women who have had a lot of cosmetic work - there are a fair few of them in showbusiness - and it makes me recoil			2
i ca n't bear anything fake - even false nails - and so i 'd rather have wrinkles than look frozen in time			2
' occasionally i do look in the mirror and see how flat - chested i am and think for a moment : " oh , it would be nice to have a bit of a plump up			2
" ' i have this fantasy of myself wearing a long , plunging dress and all eyes are on my cleavage			0
but the reality is breast enlargement is major surgery involving anaesthetic , stitches and drips			0
' also , i do n't want to be walking around in my dotage with the ridiculous breasts of a 22 - year - old			2
so in those moments of self - doubt , i simply stick on some nice underwear and pop in the chicken fillets for a bit of an extra lift			2
' @entity1 's only real nod to her age is buying expensive anti-ageing moisturisers and having a facial every month			0
' the fact i 'm confident enough to be photographed in a crop top at my age shows how much women 's attitudes have changed , ' she explains			2
' for us , growing older is no longer a fear , it 's a celebration			0
' @entity1 is an ambassador for lovetolearn.co.uk we 're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable .			0
