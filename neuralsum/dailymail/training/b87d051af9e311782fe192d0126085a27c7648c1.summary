by @entity0 got a pair of old trainers you think are rubbish ? they ’ve got nothing on these , which literally are made of garbage found out and about			1
the bizarre footwear might at first look like they were crafted from high - end materials , but closer inspection reveals their trashy beginnings			2
the project called ‘ everything you buy is rubbish ’ used waste found on @entity18 shores such as the @entity19 to make the attire			1
they say the exercise was a satirical look at how often we throw away things such as old shoes in favour of getting a new pair , where once we would buy products that were long - lasting and reliable the purpose of the creation was to show how plastic is having a negative effect on our environment			1
scientists claim that a ‘ green ’ biofuel made from waste coffee grounds could power vehicles on our roads			1
researchers at the @entity50 said waste coffee grounds could be a sustainable fuel source for powering vehicles			2
around 22lbs ( 10kg ) of leftover grounds , generated by the average coffee shop , produces around two litres of the biofuel			0
the scientists believe that if this were scaled up nationally , popular high street coffee shops such as @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 could soon be rivalling oil giants like @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
@entity67 students @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 devised the idea together to highlight our waste culture			1
‘ @entity71 dumped in a landfill or washed up on the shoreline , everything that you buy will inevitably end up as rubbish , ’ they write			2
‘ with the development of plastic came a utopian promise - that this revolutionary material would change our lives			0
‘ it has now become so materially ingrained in our lives and environment that it ’s becoming increasingly indistinguishable and inseparable from nature			0
‘ we made these shoes completely out of rubbish we trawled from @entity18 shorelines as a satirical communication tool to convey the direct correlation between waste and consumerism , and the disposability of contemporary products			1
the multi-coloured shoes were made from trash found on @entity18 shores including the @entity19			1
' with the development of plastic came a utopian promise - that this revolutionary material would change our lives , ' the team said			0
but they say this has been for the worse , with plastic waste now found everyhwere the team also made satirical posters to highlight some of the effects of waste and show how they made the shoes			1
using twists on popular slogans such as @entity112 's ' just do it ' the team explained how the trainers are ' a product of your consumption ' and representative the negative effect we are having on our environment the team says the humble shoe is a prime example of the ‘ out of sight and out of mind ’ legacy of the modern consumer			1
they say shoes were once hand crafted items that were not only durable but repairable , but now people discard them as soon as they become slightly damaged			0
and shoes are now so mass produced that it is becoming common to throw them away regularly and get a new pair , rather than getting an existing pair fixed			1
‘ after you 've finished with them they 're just another ( two ) piece ( s ) of rubbish that are likely to still be around long after your own body has decomposed ; we 're all leaving behind ourselves a rubbish legacy , ' they write			0
' we made these shoes completely out of rubbish we trawled from @entity18 shorelines as a satirical communication tool to convey the direct correlation between waste and consumerism , and the disposability of contemporary products , ' said the team			1
there 's no news if they have plans for more such clothing in future , though the team adds that modern culture dictates that people often buy new clothing to maintain their appearance , but it is at the detriment of the environment			0
‘ we reflect an image of ourselves through our clothing , ' they say			0
‘ the first of our clothing to show signs of damage is footwear			2
‘ in the eyes of the consumer , a superficial blemish or a shift in the latest trend is all that ’s needed to warrant a new purchase			0
‘ contemporary footwear spends barely a fraction of its life hugging a foot			0
‘ for the majority of its life it is rubbish			0
‘ whether in a landfill or washed up on a shoreline , the synthetics within the shoes - in addition to the plethora of plastic we discard - will take centuries to break down			2

three @entity67 students have created shoes made from plastic waste
they *collected* the trash on shores in the @entity18 including the @entity19
using the rubbish they found they then created a pair of colourful footwear
a series of satirical posters show the negative effects of consumer culture
the project is intended to highlight our habits of throwing things away
