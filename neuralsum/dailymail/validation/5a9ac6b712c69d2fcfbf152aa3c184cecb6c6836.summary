two ' petite ' firearms officers who won a sex discrimination case over the size of their big guns have spoken out against the ' malicious ' police force amid claims they are being ' starved ' back to work			1
@entity7 and @entity8 won their sex discrimination case against the @entity10 on the grounds they could not reach the trigger at a hearing in february last year			1
but now both women believe their careers are over , a remedy hearing at @entity16 heard today			1
ms @entity7 branded the organisation 's attitude towards her as ' disgraceful ' while ms @entity21 claimed the case had brought her ' a great deal of stress and anxiety ' , adding : ' they are making me choose between my mental health and paying the bills			1
' bullied : firearms officer @entity8 , who sued the @entity29 @entity10 ( @entity30 ) after claiming her firearm was too big for her small hand , says she has been bullied by the ' malicious ' force both women , in their 30s , are still employed by the constabulary but are on sick leave due to stress on pensionable pay - resulting in them not getting full pay			1
they had returned to work after winning their case last year but miss @entity7 complained they only did ' menial ' jobs which was ' completely belittling and humiliating			1
' they are part of the armed cnc and help protect power stations at @entity48 in @entity49 and @entity50 in @entity51 and @entity52			0
both claimed at the original tribunal that their reputations were damaged because their unsuitable equipment - a @entity57 17 - meant they received lower marks than men in firing range tests while protective gear was too big for their small heads and legs			2
the tribunal found the @entity30 guilty of indirect sex discrimination but dismissed claims of victimisation			2
in going though the series of complaints made by the women today , @entity68 , representing the @entity30 , noted that @entity72 felt the force 's treatment of her has been ' malicious and unpleasant '			1
miss @entity8 , who was diagnosed with depression in february 2014 , claimed : ' i believe that my career with the constabulary is at an end			1
' she added that she has ' no faith in the constabulary and that i would be treated fairly '			0
she suggested that her mental health has not been helped by the time it has taken to try and resolve the case , and even doubts whether the @entity30 believes they have done anything wrong			0
she added : ' the constabulary has behaved in a particularly malicious manner			0
i believe this has been to intimidate			0
' mr @entity89 also said that @entity90 had claimed that she had been put on pensionable pay			0
@entity92 : both complained that the handle of her @entity57 pistol ( pictured ) was too big for her hands he noted that she believes ' this was an attempt to starve her back to to work so that the claim can be made that she is fit and well and totally unaffected '			1
the women were also left disappointed because they felt nothing had changed in the force despite them winning their sex discrimination case last year			1
giving evidence today dr @entity105 , a consultant psychiatrist at the @entity106 in @entity107 , told the tribunal : ' they were hoping for change but nothing happened			0
' the psychiatrist added he believed both of the women were suffering from ' adjustment disorder ' - a short - term condition that occurs when a person has great difficulty coping with , or adjusting to , a particular source of stress			2
describing miss @entity8 ' condition further he added : ' she 's had a depressive illness that has prompted treatment			2
' it has taken a very long time to deal with and this has exasperated the claimants ' mental health issues			0
' he believed both women would need a course of cognitive behaviour therapy to help combat their stress			2
however the tribunal did hear the constabulary has since ordered an equality impact assessment and offered the women the chance to re-take their shooting tests with a @entity141 gun which has a smaller handle			2
but mr @entity89 said : ' they had both rejected the offer that they could take the shooting test with a different gun with a smaller handle			0
' the constabulary had applied to appeal the decision but their application to appeal was rejected in june 2014			0
the hearing - expected to last four days - continues .			0
