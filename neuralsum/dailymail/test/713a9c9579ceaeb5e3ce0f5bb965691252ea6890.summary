' i started needing the toilet more and more often , until i could n't even get off the bathroom floor			1
' my partner @entity48 was at work and i called him 76 times in half an hour to get him to come home			2
' by the time he got to mine i was able to introduce him to his son			1
' miss @entity0 , originally from @entity2 , had been to a @entity57 's party at her brother 's house in @entity60 and was due to stay in @entity2 for a few days afterwards			1

mr @entity29 is pictured with his son ( left ) and with miss @entity0 , two days before she gave birth ( right ) but she began feeling ill and so she and her partner travelled home a day early			1
looking back , not wanting to drink alcohol was the only way her body changed during her pregnancy			2
she said : ' i had one @entity80 on @entity81			2
i started drinking it but just did n't want it			0
' being off alcohol was the only change in me			0
i stayed a size six to eight and did n't have any morning sickness or put on any weight			0
' i was on the bathroom floor with cramps and i suddenly felt the urge to push			1
three pushes later and my baby was born			2
' luckily he was crying and i 've seen tv shows so knew what to do			0
' i wrapped him in a towel and checked his hands and feet			0
' @entity23 was born on january 5 at 11:22am , weighing a healthy 6lbs			0
mr @entity29 came over to miss @entity0 's house , ordered an ambulance straight away , and the new family travelled to hospital			1
@entity48 's sister had given birth five months earlier and was able to bring a car seat to the hospital so they could take the baby home safely			1
but otherwise , the couple did n't have any baby clothes , let alone a cot			2
miss @entity0 said : ' i gave birth on the sunday night and was in hospital until wednesday			1
@entity23 is ' the best thing that ever happened ' to her and her partner , miss @entity62 said			0
she added : ' @entity23 is our little miracle ' ' my mum and dad were able to get me some essentials , including a cot bed , and @entity48 's parents us nappies and a steriliser , but when i came out of hospital i went straight to the baby shop to get the rest			2
' it closed in ten minutes and i just told the staff that i needed literally everything			0
' now , miss @entity0 and @entity48 , who both live with their parents , are splitting their time with the baby between their homes			1
they are waiting to see if their offer on a home of their own has been accepted			0
miss @entity0 said : ' it 's all happened very quickly and been very expensive			1
' i 've adapted to being a mum straight away and @entity48 is a very proud dad			0
' it 's the best thing to happen to us			0
@entity23 is our little miracle			0
' ms @entity148 , of the @entity149 said although miss @entity0 ’s situation is uncommon , it is not unusual			1
she said : ‘ some women just do n’t know they are pregnant ‘ one lady was serving in @entity154 and did n’t realise she was pregnant , and we had to send services out there			0
‘ it might happen for a variety of reasons			0
it ’s different for any women			0
‘ there are some women with good abdominal muscles and fat and the baby lies flat against the back so they do n’t have a bump			1
‘ some women wo n’t have the normal pregnancy symptoms			2
‘ some women feel the baby moving inside them , but some do n’t			2
some women have good abdominal muscles and fat and the baby lies flat against the back so they do n't have a bump , says ms @entity148 , of the @entity149 ‘ a lot of the symptoms of pregnancy are ‘ everyday ’ symptoms			1
so they might not know that having wind is a sign of pregnancy			2
especially if they ’ve never had a baby			2
’ ‘ not all women are body - conscious			0
it depends on what ’s going on in their life			0
’ in these cases , the midwife has an important role in supporting the new family , as adjusting to being a parents can be a shock			2
she said : ‘ the women themselves are totally shocked when it happens to them			0
‘ a lot of talking and reassurance by the midwife is needed			0
‘ they need to say the occurrence is unusual but the woman herself is not abnormal			0
‘ that woman is going to need a lot of help and support adjusting to being a parent			0
‘ women with unplanned pregnancies get very upset , so imagine one day you have a normal life and the next you are a parent			0
‘ the midwife would give that woman a lot more care , watching for signs of post-natal depression or even post-natal unhappiness			0

@entity0 , 24 , kept needing the toilet and believed she had period cramps
she was actually in labour and gave birth to her son on the bathroom floor
her pregnancy came as a shock as she had been on the contraceptive pill
she continued to have periods , and had no baby bump and no cravings
