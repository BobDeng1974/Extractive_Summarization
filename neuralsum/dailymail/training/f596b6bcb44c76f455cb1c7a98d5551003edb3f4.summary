before coming out as a transgender female , @entity0 was better known as international boxing promoter @entity2 , who took @entity3 to become the undisputed @entity4			1
earlier this year she shocked the macho world of boxing by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman			2
@entity0 , 61 , is now undergoing a raft of cosmetic treatments to become a woman			1
this week she had a state - of - the - art semi-permanent make - up treatment at @entity17 clinic @entity15			1
the two - hour appointment included an eyebrow treatment , which claims to add a more feminine defined arch , a treatment to accentuate and widen her eyes , and a lip treatment , which promises to re-shape and boost the natural lip colour			1
during the treatment @entity0 said : ' if i had n’t come - out as a woman , i would n’t be laying here on a beauty clinic treatment bed , i would be laying on a slab in an undertakers			1
that was the choice i had , it was either let it beat me and have the depression kill me or come out and embrace the world			0
' ' on my way to the clinic today , some girls stopped me and said they really admired what i was doing and how brave i was			0
but i do n’t put it down to bravery , i put it down to being a necessity of what i had to do			0
' glamorous : @entity0 , 61 , is now undergoing a raft of cosmetic treatments to become a woman before her final sex change operation in january spot the difference : the two - hour appointment included an eyebrow treatment which added a more feminine defined arch , a treatment to accentuate and widen her eyes , and a lip treatment , which re-shaped and boosted the natural lip colour ( left , after , right , before ) @entity0 admitted that the semi-permanent make - up treatment was going to be a great help for her because she is n't yet an expert at doing her own make - up			1
and she added : ' i find it really hard to do eyeliner , i smudge it every time , and this will help me so that when i get up out of bed in the morning i do n’t have to spend so much time doing my make - up , and i ’ve always wanted my eyebrows to have a more feminine arch and look more natural - and hopefully a bit more beautiful			1
' when i was @entity2 i tried to keep my eyebrows quite fine , and i always wanted to have arches			0
i was quite vain as @entity2 but now i ’m even vainer as @entity86			0
' process : @entity0 admitted that the semi-permanent make - up treatment was going to be a great help for her because she is n't yet an expert at doing her own make - up in action : since coming out as a woman this august , @entity0 , pictured being treated by @entity15 , said she has looked to female role models like @entity86 , @entity94 and @entity95 to model herself and her new look on to prepare for the treatment @entity0 had her eyebrows and lips covered with an anesthetic cream for 20 minutes , then the shape and size of the eyebrows were carefully measured and the outline of the new shape was created with an eyebrow pencil			1
when @entity0 was happy with the shape , @entity15 started the treatment with a pen device which holds ultra-fine needles			2
@entity15 matched the chosen pigments to the natural colour of @entity0 ’s eyebrows , and with precisely simulated hair strokes , create a defined lift to the arch of the brow - @entity0 said this would be similar to that of daughters @entity118 , 19 and @entity120 , 13			2
since coming out as a woman this august , @entity0 said she has looked to female role models like @entity86 , @entity94 and @entity95 to model herself and her new look on , but she admitted during the treatment that the most important influence on her is from female members of her close family			2
helping hand : with the new semi-permanent make - up , @entity0 admitted most people do n't think she looks like a man anymore @entity0 said : ' to be honest , my three daughters are my role models and they help me ! also my mum has been totally unbelievable since she was told about 15 months ago			1
@entity134 from £ 760 @entity135 ( top and bottom lid ) £ 1,000 kiss @entity139 treatment £ 1,270 total : £ 3,030 ' my two eldest ones , who are quite big now , do n’t call me dad , but my 13 - year - old she still does			0
i still get a few funny looks but as people recognise me as @entity0 now so they do n’t pay me as much attention			2
' and she added : ' my mother tells me not to wear heavy make - up every day , she tells me i must let my skin breathe			1
my mother hardly wears much make - up - a little bit of lipstick and bit of powder , and she ’d just wear a bit of @entity155 cream and she still uses it today , she ’s 81 and she ’s got beautiful skin			1
she looks like she ’s in her 60s			0
we are very close now and she ’s very protective of me and she sits and shows me pictures of her when she was younger and she ’s stunning			0
' when i look at my daughters and i think what fun they have , and how they look , i think i will never experience that , but the experience i have now is like starting all over again			0
' my three daughters are very helpful for me getting my style right and i sit and watch the tv presenters , and shows like @entity169 and friends and i would model myself on them			0
' i would walk along and watch women walking along the street and how they dress			0
when i first came out , i would never wear jeans			0
i wanted to look natural but unfortunately i ’m very recognisable			0
' @entity174 : @entity0 captures a quick snap with @entity15 mid-way through her treatment but with the new semi-permanent make - up , @entity0 admitted most people do n’t think she looks like a man anymore			1
@entity0 added : ' i wonder what my colleagues would think now if they can see the semi-permanent make - up treatment that i ’ve had ? i ’ve heard a few stories from people in the boxing world who think it ’s all one of @entity2 big stunts and that i ’ve fooled you all and i want to stay as @entity2			1
' but i think to myself they have got to be crazy , no human being would put themselves through some of the treatment that i ’ve been having - the hormones , the electrolysis , the operations - this semi-permanent treatment is fine , but the other stuff is n’t nice			2
' and i ’m going to have surgery in @entity200 in november on my nose because my nostrils are too big and they are going to lift the eyes and then on january 13th i ’m going to have my operation and breasts done			2
' but i ’m so pleased with the semi-permanent make - up i ’ve had , my face looks so much more feminine now			1
i ’ll definitely come back to have a top up a couple of times a year			0
' next step : @entity0 is going to have surgery in @entity200 in november on her nose because she says her nostrils are too big heavyweight : former boxing promoter @entity2 , who is now living as @entity0			0
