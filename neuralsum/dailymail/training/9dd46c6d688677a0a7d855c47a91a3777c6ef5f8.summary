while the return of the @entity2 this weekend will see debuts from exciting deadline - day signings , there 's also room to celebrate loyal servants at clubs			1
@entity9 ' retirement at the end of last season brought an end to a glittering career for the @entity15 winger , but it also ensured his baton of longest - serving @entity2 player needed to be passed on			1
taking the @entity19 's place as the top flight 's longest - serving player is @entity22 , with the @entity25 captain 's debut coming as far back as november 1998 when the midfielder replaced @entity27 with a minute to be played in the @entity29 ' 2 - 0 home win over @entity30			1
the retirement of @entity9 has made @entity22 the @entity2 's longest serving player not far behind @entity22 is @entity33 , with the @entity35 captain making his @entity2 debut a month later on @entity37			1
the former @entity39 skipper was also a second - half substitute , replacing @entity40 in @entity35 's 2 - 0 win at @entity42			1
few of the remaining top - flight sides have players who have spent over 10 years at the elite level , but with the transfer window now shut and the squads settled , @entity46 has looked at the longest serving players at @entity2 every club			1
@entity52 - @entity51 ( debut for current club - 21/1/2006 ) he 's only managed 124 appearances in eight - and - a - half years , but @entity51 takes the crown as @entity52 's longest serving player			1
the midfielder , who signed from @entity59 in january 2006 , made his debut as substitute in a 1 - 0 defeat to @entity63 in the same month and is currently fighting to get back into @entity65 's first team			0
@entity51 ( left ) signed for @entity52 from @entity59 before making his debut in 2006 while @entity67 came through @entity69 's youth academy before netting on his first start for the @entity72 club @entity69 - @entity67 ( 18/3/2006 ) there wo n't be many @entity69 fans too keen to remember @entity67 's debut , but the @entity69 striker at least has a reason to smile about it as he scored in the club 's 4 - 1 defeat by @entity63			0
@entity81 - @entity80 ( 20/12/2009 ) @entity80 made his @entity2 debut in 2009 , but first featured for @entity81 in august 2004 in a 1 - 1 @entity83 draw with @entity84			2
the 36 - year - old signed for just £ 30,000 from @entity86			0
@entity80 ( left ) has spent 10 years at @entity81 while @entity33 is the league 's second - longest - serving player @entity35 - @entity33 ( 07/08/2004 ) now known as ' captain , leader , legend ' , it was small steps to start with for @entity33 who was thrown into the @entity2 spotlight on @entity37 in 1998 as a substitute during the @entity95 2 - 0 win at @entity42			1
@entity98 - @entity97 ( 14/8/2004 ) not many would have backed @entity97 to have lasted over 10 years at @entity98 after a shaky first season , but the goalkeeper has turned into a fan favourite over the years , @entity102 ( left ) joined @entity63 's senior team in 2001 from the youth academy while @entity97 arrived at @entity98 in 2004 following the @entity98 ' promotion from the second tier @entity63 - @entity102 ( 31/3/2001 ) a product of the @entity63 ' academy , @entity102 began his senior @entity63 career way back in 2001 under then manager @entity110			0
the tough - tackling right back has since gone on to earn a testimonial and signed a new two - year contract earlier this summer			0
@entity114 - @entity113 ( 13/09/2008 ) @entity113 made a winning start for @entity114 in a 2 - 1 win at @entity117 , and despite suffering relegation with the @entity119 has since helped the club back into the top flight			0
@entity122 ( left ) came through @entity124 's academy in 2007 , while @entity113 joined @entity114 a year later @entity124 - @entity122 ( 02/10/2007 ) it 's not hard to be @entity124 's longest - serving @entity2 player given this is their first season back in the top flight for 10 years , but @entity122 made his club debut against @entity131 in an october 2007 championship clash after coming through the academy			1
@entity25 - @entity22 ( 29/11/1998 ) get out your record books and make a note because @entity22 's small cameo a minute from time in a 2 - 0 win over @entity30 makes him officially the @entity2 's longest - serving player			1
@entity22 has been in the @entity25 team since 1998 , while @entity141 made his @entity143 debut in 2005 @entity143 - @entity141 ( 22/10/2005 ) @entity141 burst onto the scene in 2005 after working his way up @entity143 's youth academy			1
his debut came against @entity148 in october 2005 but he has recently joined @entity150 side @entity149 on loan after finding first team opportunities hard to come by			0
@entity15 - @entity153 ( 27/09/2003 ) @entity153 already had @entity155 experience when he made his @entity2 debut , which came in a 4 - 1 win at @entity124 , with @entity158 grabbing a hat - trick for the @entity160			2
@entity153 ( left ) broke into @entity15 's team in 2003 in a 4 - 1 win at @entity124 while @entity163 made his @entity117 debut a year later in a 1 - 0 defeat by @entity166 @entity117 - @entity163 ( 28/03/2004 ) @entity163 's debut in the @entity117 defence was just four minutes long when @entity166 's @entity169 scored the winning goal , but the centre - half has since proven his worth by going on to make 196 league appearances for the @entity173			1
@entity175 - @entity174 ( 18/08/2009 ) currently ruled out with another serious knee injury , @entity174 became @entity175 's club record signing when he moved to @entity178 for £ 3.5million in july 2009			2
the talented midfielder has played for the @entity175 121 times since but his career hit by a number of serious knee problems in recent years			0
@entity174 ( left ) and @entity184 made their debuts for their respective clubs , @entity175 and @entity42 , while both teams were in the championship @entity42 - @entity184 ( 06/08/2006 ) signed from @entity190 in 2006 , @entity184 enjoyed a prolonged spell in the @entity42 first team but is now third choice behind @entity194 and @entity195			0
the veteran goalkeeper made his debut in august 2006 and has gone on to play for @entity42 on another 261 occasions			0
@entity200 - @entity199 ( 16/10/2001 ) after coming through @entity200 's academy system @entity199 made his debut for the club while he was still a teenager way back in 2001			0
thirteen years later and he 's still a member of the first team squad , having also spent time out on loan at @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210			0
@entity199 ( left ) is still part of the @entity200 first team squad after coming through the club 's academy system , while @entity215 's five years at @entity190 is bettered by no @entity190 team - mate @entity190 - @entity215 ( 15/08/2009 ) no @entity190 player can boast more than @entity215 's five years at the club , with the midfielder playing in a 1 - 0 win at @entity166 following a £ 6million move from @entity222			2
@entity224 - @entity223 ( 07/02/2004 ) signed from @entity15 after two successful loan spells , @entity223 has enjoyed over a decade at @entity224 since arriving in 2004			2
the defender has spent the last couple of years mostly out on loan , with stints at @entity230 , @entity231 and , most recently , @entity232			0
@entity223 ( left ) and @entity233 ( right ) are the longest serving players at @entity224 and @entity235 @entity235 - @entity233 ( 27/08/2005 ) the departure of @entity237 has left @entity233 as @entity235 's longest - serving player having made his debut in a 2 - 0 home defeat by @entity35 in august 2005			1
