if you like vacations to include filthy bathrooms , nerve - wracking elevator rides and a potential murder scene then say hello the @entity5 - at least , that is , if you believe the online reviews			0
the historic @entity9 landmark which opened in 1927 promoted itself as a luxury hotel with 800 rooms in the bustling downtown area			1
in its heyday , there was also a dining room , coffee shop , ball room and 11 stores			0
however as fortunes changed in the once - industrious @entity22 city , so did the luck of the hotel where in recent years guests have complained of indescribable smells , surly staff and filthy conditions up until it finally closed its doors			1
hotel of horrors : among guests ' complaints about the @entity5 in downtown @entity9 are rude staff , paper - thin walls and filthy rooms enjoy your stay ! the @entity39 closed its doors as a hotel several years ago and has been converted into apartments creepy : the once - grand hotel was slated by guests in reviews who described the terrifying condition of the rooms and the unsavory characters roaming the halls reviews posted on @entity52 by one - time guests of the @entity39 allege that conditions were almost comically bad at the hotel			1
according to a @entity9 couple , who claim to have stayed in march 2009 while attending a music festival in the downtown area , the @entity39 ' is an experience all in itself '			1
the guest , registered on the travel site as @entity62 , writes : ' ... the staff was ( is ) extremely unhelpful , and when we finally got up to our room ( the elevators are as horrific as everyone has described ) and begun to unpack , another couple unlocks our room door and walks in			0
the hotel double booked our room ! ' one of the years we stayed there ... someone had been stabbed right in front of the doors to the hotel and there was a huge puddle of blood on the ground			2
' another time , in the very early morning , we were verbally assaulted by someone who apparently worked in the hotel			0
' grand : the lobby of the @entity39 is still impressive but one guest commented that the dance club in the building left you feeling like you were inside a speaker room with a view : it 's hard to see what attracted visitors to the downtown @entity9 landmark landmark : the hotel opened in 1927 but in its final years was dogged by scathing reviews from guests they do admit that the lobby is ' huge and has an old timey beauty to it ' but thanks to the dance club downstairs , it is ' like being inside a subwoofer '			1
another guest @entity108 , who claimed to have traveled all the way from @entity110 to the hotel , complained of ' a smell to it that i could never quite work out ' in the same lobby			2
he alleged : ' the elevators seemed like a zoo , everytime you went in you found another unique local savage and with it the feeling of watching your back and pockets			0
' @entity108 also claimed that his hotel room windows were coated in dirt , the toilet and bath had not been cleaned while the shower did n't work properly			0
scary stay : guests noted that the graffiti - tagged hallways and poor lighting were not for the ' faint - hearted ' grimy : chunks of plaster missing from a dank wall at the @entity39 heyday : the @entity9 - @entity39 boasted 800 rooms , a ballroom and grand lobby when it first opened in 1927 he concluded : ' avoid at all costs ! ' @entity144 rounded up the best of the worst reviews from the 20 - storey hotel			1
these included such reports : ' if you have a weak heart or are easily spooked , i do not recommend taking the stairs			0
graffiti tagged walls and dimly lit wells made this an experience in its self			0
' another former guest claimed : ' i saw the several large broken pieces of plaster , which had hours earlier been a 3 by 1 foot section of the archway to the door ... my friend 's head was nearly crushed while he slept by a piece of the ceiling ... ' it is unclear when the @entity39 finally closed its doors as a hotel but now operates as a private apartment block			1
a person who answered the phone for the @entity39 on sunday did not have any comment .			2
