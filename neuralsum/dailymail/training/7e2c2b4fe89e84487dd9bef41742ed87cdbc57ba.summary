with its glamorous stars such as @entity2 and @entity3 , glittering costumes and teasing routines , burlesque has never been more popular			1
but although it might seem like a modern phenomenon , burlesque has roots that lie deep in the world of the @entity10 music halls - and even beyond			1
the old halls were at the heart of popular entertainment in @entity14 and drew huge crowds hungry for fun , music and spectacle			1
in the preceding years of the 18th century , everything from taverns to coffee houses had been for men alone			2
inside their doors , singers and musicians entertained the men while they dined , drank and discussed business and politics , or , perhaps after a glass or two of wine , join in with the choruses			0
singing nights became so popular that taverns began to put on musical nights in special rooms , and soon glee clubs were a regular night out for young men			2
at the bottom of the scale were the ‘ penny gaffs ’ : dismal shops where costermonger boys and girls paid a penny apiece for some rough food and drink served up with patriotic singing and comedy sketches			0
colourful : @entity60 in @entity61 was once one of @entity14 's most popular venues star : the 1930s @entity66 actress @entity65 was one of the last great music hall stars one lad told the @entity10 historian @entity69 , ' the songs are out and out , and makes our gals laugh			1
the smuttier the better , i thinks ; bless you ! the gals like it as much as we do '			0
so widespread were the penny gaffs , there were reputedly 20 of these dens within a five - mile radius of @entity83 in @entity14			0
entertaining though they might have been , they certainly were not places for a decent woman to visit , any more than the taverns and gin palaces were			0
by the 1830s some slightly better song and supper rooms began to attract a more refined audience , although women were still not allowed to enter , and performers could expect a hail of bottles or boots as well as verbal abuse if their act went down badly			0
singers at venues like the @entity102 , a notorious dive just off the @entity104 , would be paid £ 1 a week and all they drink they could hold			0
they probably needed to be drunk in order to face their audiences			0
@entity108 on @entity14 ’s @entity109 ( famous from the nursery rhyme ‘ @entity111 ’ ) was one of the musical taverns , and there were countless others in towns and cities the length of the country			0
fame : @entity121 , a singer , was particularly notorious and was even banned from the @entity66 for immorality but things were changing and the first purpose - built music hall opened its doors in the @entity14 borough of @entity127 in 1852			1
the @entity128 had a capacity of 700 , and the early all - male audiences came to eat and drink as much as to be entertained			2
a resounding success , it was soon enlarged to hold 1500 people and pioneered the concept of the music hall , including entertainment for women			1
@entity137 , the @entity128 ’s owner , believed that women had a civilising effect and made a deliberate effort to attract them by introducing ‘ @entity141 ’			0
gentlemen could bring a female companion , but in a setting where prostitutes openly worked the aisles the men were not always accompanied by their wives			0
a flood of new venues opened up in @entity14 and throughout the rest of the @entity152 , with the result that by 1870 , there were 31 large halls in @entity14 and 384 in the rest of the country			2
helped by the opening of the first underground railway line , the @entity161 , more affluent suburban audiences could easily make their way to @entity163 for a night out , and with money to spend they demanded more and better shows in a less risque setting			0
impersonator : @entity168 , who died in 1952 , was a hugely popular male impersonator marriage : @entity168 went on to marry sir @entity171 , conservative mp and theatre impresario popular : ms @entity168 finally retired from her music hall career in 1920 when she married sir @entity171 new performers were needed to fill the stages at all the brash new empires and palaces that soon sprang up to meet the new middle - class demand , so young women – often the daughters of supper club and tavern veterans – stepped into the spotlight for the first time			1
the stage offered an independent life for many of them , and stardom for a few			0
a typical music hall bill would feature a chairman keeping order with a gavel , a comedian or two , dancers in daring costume , novelty acts like a juggler , contortionists , trapeze artists or trick cyclists , a drag act , and a magician			2
stage magic often employed new science like electricity or magnetism , and audiences were enthralled by the illusions			0
a dynasty of stage illusionists called the @entity211 opened a magic theatre on @entity213 known as the @entity214 , and here young women were sawn in half or levitated or chased through comedy disappearing acts for thousands of performances			0
the centrepiece of music hall , however , was music – and the star was always the singer			1
men like @entity225 and then @entity226 were adored , but it was the women and their signature songs who topped the bill			2
@entity168 was a male impersonator			1
she was @entity232 , every inch the monocled dandy to look at , but singing in a high and very feminine voice			0
retired from the stage she ended her long life as @entity238 , wife of the @entity240 mp for @entity241			1
@entity121 was the queen of @entity242			1
she had made her debut as a table singer at the @entity108 , but soon she was the naughty phenomenon of the age			2
in her distinctive trill she warbled innocent - seeming lyrics with titles like @entity250 ! mr @entity251 , what shall i do ? and she ’d never had her ticket punched before that were loaded with double entendres – innocent enough today , but shocking to the @entity257 and @entity258			0
when the moralists protested about her song i sits among the @entity261 and @entity262 she amended it to i sits among the @entity261 and @entity264 – to howls of appreciation from her admirers			0
loved : @entity121 ( right , with her sisters ) was one of the genre 's brightest stars but succumbed to alcoholism outpouring : when @entity121 died , aged just 52 years old , her funeral was attended by 100,000 people @entity121 had a colourful private life ; she was refused entry to the @entity66 at the start of a tour because she had shared a cabin on the voyage over with a man to whom she was not married			1
unlike @entity168 ’s , her ending was a sad one – she took to the brandy and fell over drunk on stage			1
the audience thought it was part of the act and roared with laughter , but she was mortally ill and died a few days later aged only 52			2
100,000 people came to her funeral			1
the grand music hall tradition lay behind later artists like @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 , @entity294 and even the @entity295 , but the days of the halls were numbered			1
by the 1930s , they had been virtually obliterated by the rising popularity of nights spent enjoying the new films at the cinema			2
but while the music halls are gone , they certainly are n't forgotten			1
while later shows such as @entity307 were a coarse pastiche of the real thing , our own modern burlesque still captures the glitter , daring and downright risqué thrill of the long - gone old halls			1
