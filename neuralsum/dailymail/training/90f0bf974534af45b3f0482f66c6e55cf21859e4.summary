by @entity0 astronomers are tonight anticipating the skies to light up with one of the world ’s most incredible meteor showers			0
the @entity7 shower will peak late tonight and before dawn on tuesday with stunning views expected all over the world			1
star gazers in the southern hemisphere will have the best seats for the show with astronomers predicting 30 to 40 meteors to streak through the skies every hour			1
the @entity7 meteor shower is due to peak tonight , but will be visible in the night sky through to 7 may			1
pictured is the @entity22 shower taken over three nights over @entity24 in @entity25			0
the shower is made up of debris from @entity28 - one of the most famous comets in history @entity31 : @entity32 @entity33 : @entity34 active : 19 april - 28 may 2014 peak activity : 5 - 6 may 2014 @entity36 meteor count : around 45 meteors per hour @entity22 velocity : 44 miles ( 66 km ) per second where to see it : anywhere away from bright city lights			1
however , people in the southern hemisphere will have the best views			1
what time : in the early mornings , right before dawn			2
@entity48 suggests trying to see the show between 3am and 5am your local time			1
northerners might spy 5 - 10 meteors per hour over the next few mornings , with the best time to see the shower between 3am and 5am your local time			1
@entity48 claims that some @entity7 meteors may also be visible for a few days after 6 may , due to the shower 's broad peak period			1
‘ what makes this shower somewhat special is that the meteors stem from the most famous comet in all of history , @entity28 , ’ said @entity60 astronomer @entity59			1
‘ as @entity28 goes around the sun in its 76 - year orbit , pieces of it , little chunks of ice , slough off the comet and we intersect that every year around this time , in early may			1
’ a view of the @entity7 meteor shower as a result of @entity78 passing through dust released by @entity28 seen from @entity80 on @entity81 , the @entity82 in 2013 @entity28 returns to @entity78 's vicinity approximately every 75 years , so some people could see it twice in their lifetime			1
the last time it was here was in 1986 , and it is projected to return in 2061			0
the comet is named after @entity90 astronomer @entity89 , who examined reports of a comet approaching @entity78 in 1531 , 1607 and 1682			0
@entity28 's most famous appearance occurred shortly before the 1066 invasion of @entity90 by @entity95			2
it is said that @entity95 felt the comet heralded his success			0
the comet was put on the @entity100 as a result			0
@entity7 meteors are known for their speed travelling at 148,000 mph ( 66 km / s )			2
fast meteors can leave glowing ‘ trains ’ of incandescent debris which last for several seconds to minutes			2
in the @entity107 , @entity7 meteors can be seen as ‘ earthgrazers			2
’ these are long meteors that appear to skim the surface of the @entity78 at the horizon			0
to view the @entity22 , @entity48 suggests finding an area well away from city or street lights , prepared with a sleeping bag , blanket or chair			0
‘ lie flat on your back with your feet facing east and look up , taking in as much of the sky as possible , ’ the space agency advises			0
‘ after about 30 minutes in the dark , your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors			0
be patient - the show will last until dawn , so you have plenty of time to catch a glimpse			1
’ meteors come from leftover comet particles and bits of broken asteroids			0
when comets come around the sun , they leave a dusty trail behind them			0
every year the @entity78 passes through these debris trails , which allows the bits to collide with our atmosphere where they disintegrate to create fiery and colourful streaks in the sky			1
a @entity48 fireball camera at the @entity148 in @entity149 caught these @entity7 meteors in flight			2
@entity7 meteors are known for their speed and can travel at 148,000 mph ( 66 km / s ) the pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the @entity7 originate from comet @entity28			1
each time that @entity28 returns to the inner solar system its nucleus sheds a layer of ice and rock into space			2
the dust grains eventually become the @entity22 in may and the @entity164 in october if they collide with @entity78 's atmosphere			0
@entity28 takes about 76 years to orbit the sun once			0
the last time comet @entity28 was seen from the @entity78 was in 1986			2
@entity28 will not enter the inner solar system again until 2061			0
the pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the @entity22 originate from comet @entity28 ( pictured )			1
@entity28 returns to @entity78 's vicinity approximately every 75 years , so some people could see it twice in their lifetime			0

@entity7 shower will peak late tonight and before dawn on tuesday
sky *watchers* in southern hemisphere will have best seats for the show
northerners might spy 5 - 10 meteors per hour over the next few mornings
the best time to see the shower is between 3am and 5am your local time
the pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the @entity7 originate from @entity28
