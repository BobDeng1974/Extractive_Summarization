however it would be impossible to file charges because the statute of limitations has run out			0
@entity6 , wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison , told reporters outside @entity70 that he was angry			0
' i 'm not angry at the system			0

@entity6 was convicted and sentenced to 37 years in prison - he served 15			2
' poster boy ' : @entity14 ( pictured right after his release with @entity54 ) was sentenced to death after initially being convicted in the shooting of two people in @entity84 but the @entity22 began re-examining his conviction last year after his attorney presented evidence that he had been threatened with the death penalty and coerced into confessing with promises that he would get an early release and share in the profits from book and movie deals			1

she also said there remains powerful evidence that @entity14 was the gunman , including several witnesses who still maintain their original statements			0
' as i stand here today , i ca n't definitely tell you it was @entity14 who did this or @entity6 who did this , ' she said			2
@entity12 , who retired from @entity11 in 2011 amid questions about his investigative methods , has not responded to phone calls for comment , but has previously defended his methods and results			2
