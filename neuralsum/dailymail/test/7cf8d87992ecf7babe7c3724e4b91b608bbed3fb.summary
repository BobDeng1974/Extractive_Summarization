one @entity1 trader closed out his week a few million dollars richer last friday - and it was all thanks to social media			1
the unnamed trader used perfect timing to capitalize on one of the biggest deals of the year when @entity10 mergers and acquisitions reporter @entity9 took to @entity11 to announce that @entity12 was in talks to buy one of its competitors , chipmaker @entity16			1
seconds later , the trader had snapped up 3,158 contracts of @entity16 , with each option contract giving them the right to purchase 100 shares			0
3:32pm : the @entity10 reports that @entity12 is in talks to buy @entity16			2
3:33pm : trader purchases 315,800 shares of @entity16 at $ 36 a share for a total cost of $ 11,368,000 plus $ 110,530 for a $ 0.35 call option			1
3:35pm : @entity46 suspends trading of @entity16 in the wake of the @entity10 's tweet			0
4:00pm : trader sells @entity16 at the new share price of $ 44.39 for a total of $ 14,018,362			2
this , after factoring in the intital share price and call option , leaves them with a profit of approximately $ 2,539.832			0
this call option allowed the trader the right to purchase more shares in the company , in this case 315,800 shares , at the cost of $ 36 , even though the value of shares quickly began to rise			1
just 28 minutes later , when the market closed for the day , @entity16 was valued at $ 44.39 per share			1
that was an increase of 28 % , but because of the call option , the trader was able to sell their stocks at a far greater profit			0
so instead of making a 28 % profit , the trader made a 2,220 % profit of roughly $ 2.5million when they sold their shares			1
even more impressive is that the trader managed to make the purchase just minutes before @entity46 suspended trading of @entity16 because of the tweet from @entity9			0
what 's more , call options for @entity16 had at that point reached a price of $ 8.10 by the end of the day			0
there is also a chance , reports @entity90 , that the trader could have been aware of @entity12 's plan to buy @entity16 early , or that they used a bot to quickly buy the shares			2
' a bot is not as outlandish as it sounds , ' @entity90 said			0
' traders need to aggregate and filter through tremendous amounts of data quickly and will rely on technology to help if it is available			0
' as for @entity12 's reported purchase of @entity16 , that still has yet to happen			1
meanwhile , @entity12 share prices fell earlier this week in response to the news that they might purchase @entity16 .			2

an unnamed @entity1 trader made a profit of approximately $ 2.5million on friday thanks to a tweet from the @entity10
the trader purchased 315,800 shares of chipmaker @entity16 one minute after the @entity10 reported @entity12 was in talks to purchase them
the shares were sold to the trader at $ 36 , and just 28 minutes later , when the market closed , shares were selling for $ 44.39
@entity12 's reported purchase of @entity16 still has yet to happen , and the news has actually caused the price of @entity12 shares to fall
