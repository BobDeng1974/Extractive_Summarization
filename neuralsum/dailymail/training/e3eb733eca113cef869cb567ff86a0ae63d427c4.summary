by @entity1 reporter published : 11:01 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 12:33 est , 28 march 2013 the @entity2 has ruled that a set of white foster parents should raise two toddler sisters instead of the black grandparents who have fought for them for three years			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , from @entity9 , will now raise the girls instead of @entity11 and @entity12 after the court ruled relatives should get first consideration but not preference in adoptions			1
princess and @entity19 , who are now aged three and two , were placed with the @entity20 after doctors found they both had traces of cocaine in their blood after they were born			1
as a result of the pre-natal drug ingestion , they both suffer from developmental difficulties and the court ruled that the @entity30 are better placed to provide for them			1
state laws say that race should not factor in to adoptions but require that a child 's ' cultural needs ' should be a consideration when determining a child 's best interests			0
the @entity30 ' attorney , @entity55 , told the @entity56 that there were grey areas over the word ' culture '			2
' from my perspective it was never about race , except to the extent that their race and culture is who these children are , ' @entity55 said			2
' but what does culture mean ? my clients living in the suburbs ? my clients being white ? mrs. @entity73 living in rural @entity39 ? the kids living in @entity75 ? those issues have yet to be flushed out			1
' but the @entity37 ' attorney , @entity77 , countered that race was - and should have been - a factor during the adoption proceedings			0
separated : @entity73 said she loves her granddaughters , @entity82 and @entity11 ( pictured ) , and that her ability to provide for them , as well as her blood connection to them , should come before wealth ' even if their hearts are in the right place , they ca n't give these children the same culture , the same history , the same experiences that relatives can , ' he told the @entity56			1
the battle began in 2009 when @entity82 tested positive for cocaine and was placed with the @entity20 days later			1
the @entity37 requested to adopt her , but the paperwork was ' stalled ' , the @entity56 reported			0
when @entity11 was born in 2010 , officials asked the @entity30 if they would adopt her as well , and the couple , who have seven other children , agreed			1
@entity104 district judge @entity103 said the girls should stay with the @entity30 as they could better help their special needs and moving the girls from the home could affect them			1
but the @entity109 argued that they could provide a good home for the girls so no other home should have been considered			1
grief : @entity73 has uploaded videos to @entity115 in which she shares her heartbreak over the battle difficulties : the girls were put in foster care after they were both born with traces of cocaine in their blood despite her objections and a heartfelt media campaign by @entity73 to gain custody of her granddaughters , the @entity124 sided with the @entity30			1
the @entity2 heard the case in january and reached their decision on wednesday , ruling in favour of the @entity20 5 - 2			2
justice @entity133 wrote that family members should be considered but that there is no reason not to consider other potential parents when deciding what is in the child 's best interest			2
but justice @entity141 argued that the relative 's petition should be considered first and others should only be looked at if they are not providing adequately for the child			2
he wrote : ' i do not believe that the @entity147 intended that relatives - who can meet the child 's needs and offer a loving home - be passed over merely because nonrelatives may be marginally " better " in some sense , such as being more affluent or better educated than the relative			0
' decision : the @entity2 ruled in favour of the @entity20 by a majority of 5 - 2 @entity73 had previously shared her anguish in a series of @entity115 videos and in an editorial for the @entity161			1
she wrote that she only learned her grandchildren were in care when she called the @entity164 to express her concern that her son and the children 's mother were on drugs			0
' i wanted my babies to be in a safer environment			0
i then found out that my grandchildren were in the custody of foster parents , ' , ' she wrote in january 2012			0
' i am so appreciative of the care of their foster parents , but i am the biological grandmother , and i am not giving up my rights for the belief that they belong with me			2
' although the foster parents may have multiple degrees and earn more money than we do , i am a proud and hard worker , and so is my spouse			0
i 've never turned to the government for any assistance			0
thoughtful : the @entity20 celebrated their win on @entity189 but said their thoughts were with @entity11 ' i know that money does not give love , and i love my grandchildren and desire that they experience the love			0
this is not and never has been about the finances ... i am their grandmother and will always be their grandmother			0
' but as the @entity109 struggled to come to terms with the ruling , the @entity20 took to their @entity189 page to celebrate their win - and to pass on their thoughts to the @entity37			0
' justice has been done for two little girls to stay with the only family they have ever known , ' @entity8 wrote			1
' i know @entity11 is feeling sad and my heart is heavy for her ... we will continue to honor her as the girls ' grandma and we hope we can become friends soon			0
please pray for @entity11 as she comes to grips with this decision that she can see that it is best for the girls			0

@entity75 @entity2 ruled that @entity7 and @entity8 could better provide for the sisters who have lived with them since they were babies
grandmother @entity73 has argued that love , blood relations and staying connected with their heritage should come before wealth
girls were fostered by the @entity30 , who have seven other children , after they tested positive for cocaine when they were born
@entity2 argued over whether there was even a need to consider other parents as the grandparents were able to provide for the girls
