in the parallel universe that @entity3 occasionally seems to occupy , the form team in the @entity1 had to lose some time			1
it was only their second defeat in 20 games , @entity5 ’s manager was quick to acknowledge , and there was a degree of misfortune in the way they lost to a spirited @entity15 team			1
@entity17 ’s shot in the 73rd minute had taken a major deflection off @entity20 ’s head to leave @entity21 stranded			1
@entity17 's long range shot was deflected off @entity20 ' head for @entity15 's winner in the 2 - 1 defeat of @entity5 @entity25 ( left ) celebrates with @entity26 after opening the scoring with his second goal in as many games for @entity5 @entity30 guided home a beautiful cross from @entity17 to equalise for @entity15 only two minutes after @entity5 's opener @entity3 ( centre ) had claimed before the game that @entity5 were the best team in the @entity1 on current form @entity15 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity37 6.5 ; @entity38 6 , @entity39 7 , @entity40 7 , @entity41 7 ; @entity42 7 , @entity17 7 ( @entity43 90 ) , @entity30 7.5 ; @entity44 6 ( @entity45 74 , 6 ) , @entity20 6 , @entity46 6			1
subs not used : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity43 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52			0
booked : @entity17 , @entity40 @entity5 : @entity53 6 ; @entity54 5 ( @entity55 46 ) , @entity56 6 , @entity57 6 , @entity58 5 ( @entity59 59 , 6 ) ; blind 6 ; @entity25 6.5 , @entity60 5.5 , @entity61 6 ( @entity62 79 ) , @entity26 6 , @entity63 5 subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity55 , @entity59 , @entity68 booked : @entity56 , @entity60 , @entity57 , @entity59 referee : @entity70 6.5 @entity71 : @entity72 att : 20,809 @entity74 here to see all the game 's stats , including @entity20 ' deflected winner ( above ) , from our brilliant @entity78 but @entity80 struggled to dress this up as anything other than a disappointing performance , even if he did at least take the kind of risks that many continue to demand of the @entity88			1
after a first half that finished with a goal apiece , with @entity91 for @entity93 ’s side a couple of minutes after @entity25 had opened the scoring , @entity80 displayed some genuine ambition by replacing his more defensive full backs with @entity55 and @entity59			1
it had not been a terribly successful afternoon for @entity58 or @entity54			0
they struggled against @entity15 ’s width and pace			2
but @entity55 and @entity59 ’s introduction remained a bold move , and one that worked until @entity20 diverted @entity17 ’s effort beyond @entity107			1
@entity5 had dominated the second half , leaving @entity80 ‘ amazed ’ that his side had lost			2
@entity93 , however , made the point afterwards that @entity5 managed only one shot on target after the break and , in fairness to @entity80 , he too admitted that his players made little of the possession they had enjoyed			2
he said they were not ‘ effective ’ , adding that he would need to study slow motion replays to determine exactly why			0
in real time here at the @entity120 , @entity15 were able to savour completing a @entity1 double over the @entity122 club because of the lack of cohesion and fluency that has too often been evident in @entity5 ’s football this season			1
they remain very much a work in progress for their former @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity133 boss			0
it is time to stop pining about the football that was played under sir @entity137 and accept that , with the players currently at his disposal , @entity80 is doing things differently			0
but that 81 per cent approval rating he received in a @entity144 poll might drop a few points if there are too many more displays like this			0
for now , @entity5 have dropped only a place in the @entity1 and remain in a @entity151 spot			1
but @entity152 need only draw against @entity153 to move above them and that might yet make life more uncomfortable for a manager set the target by his bosses of finishing third this season			0
@entity137 had a saying for such anxious moments but , @entity134 would no doubt agree , it should probably be retired with him			0
it felt like a short step back in time with @entity26 paired with @entity166 in attack			2
@entity68 was left on the bench			0
the result was @entity26 ’s first shot on target in the @entity1 in 2015 , albeit an effort that was probably symptomatic of too many matches spent in midfield			1
misfiring striker @entity68 , arriving at the @entity120 with @entity65 ( right ) , was relegated to the substitutes ' bench @entity177 ( right ) controls the ball under pressure from returning @entity15 midfielder @entity44 as @entity5 started strongly @entity5 frontman @entity166 takes a shot through a crowded penalty area at the @entity120 on saturday @entity26 returned to his preferred position up front , where he had his first shot on target in the 2015 calendar year @entity25 reminded @entity80 of his worth by opening the scoring for @entity5 after 28 minutes the @entity188 guided home a pass from @entity26 into the far corner to beat @entity37 @entity25 races towards @entity5 's travelling fans to celebrate after giving his side a first - half lead @entity25 slides on his knees as the @entity5 midfielder celebrates his fifth goal since his summer arrival alongside him , though , was a player who continues to look a shadow of the forward who inspired that last @entity1 title only two seasons ago			1
@entity63 was dreadful even before he suffered what seems to be a serious injury			0
a midfield comprising @entity25 , @entity177 , @entity60 and @entity208 was not entirely convincing either			2
no sooner had this contest begun than @entity5 were almost a goal down , @entity25 clearing a powerful @entity20 header off the line			1
it was close , as the goalline technology quickly illustrated			0
but what amounted to a fairly open first half saw @entity5 land the first blow after 28 minutes , @entity26 and @entity61 combining well before @entity25 unleashed a marvellous first - time strike that beat @entity37 via the inside of his far post			1
@entity80 punched the air in celebration , and understandably so			0
but barely 90 seconds later he might have been tempted to thump his defenders for failing to defend a teasing cross from @entity17			2
@entity30 reacted quickest , surging ahead of @entity58 to beat @entity107 from close range			0
@entity80 made one change at the break , replacing young @entity54 at right back with @entity55			0
and it was not long before @entity58 had been hooked too , for @entity59			0
if that summed up @entity80 ’s view of his full backs , it also remained a statement of intend and @entity5 did gain momentum with the changes			2
for long periods , @entity15 found themselves camped deep in their own half , with @entity5 pressing but unable to break through a backline led impressively by @entity40			1
it made the decisive goal all the more frustrating for @entity80 , a goal scored very much on the counter-attack			0
but , as @entity80 said , you need to convert the chances you create , and rarely did @entity5 ever look capable of doing that			2
united celebrations were short lived after @entity72 ( second left ) stole in to equalise two minutes later @entity21 , undoubtedly @entity5 's best player this season , dives in vain to stop @entity30 's shot finding the back of the net @entity30 celebrates with @entity17 after the former @entity153 midfielder supplied a superb cross for his goal the @entity254 midfielder wheels away in celebration after bringing the home side level in the first half @entity58 , @entity26 and @entity61 ( @entity258 ) look dejected as they head back to the centre circle after conceding an equaliser @entity5 defender @entity56 tries to keep pace with @entity20 , who had a shot cleared off the line in the first half @entity5 midfielder @entity60 inevitably became the first player to be cautioned after a foul on @entity268 @entity269 forward @entity61 ( right ) scoops out a shot as @entity5 begin to dominant in the second half @entity30 ( right ) comes close to doubling his tally for the afternoon but is denied by @entity5 keeper @entity107 @entity17 unleashes a long range effort that is deflected in off @entity20 to give @entity15 the lead on 73minutes @entity17 races towards @entity277 supporters to lead the celebrations despite the goal being accredited to @entity20			1

@entity15 did the double over ' in form ' @entity5 with a 2 - 1 @entity1 *victory* at the @entity120
@entity25 opened the scoring with his second goal in as many games after meeting @entity26 's pass
united celebrations were short lived as @entity72 equalised from @entity17 's cross only two minutes later
@entity17 's long *distance* strike was deflected in off @entity20 to seal the @entity277 ' first ever double over @entity5
