by @entity0 published : 08:05 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 08:43 est , 27 november 2013 @entity1 posted a picture purporting to be @entity4 's killer @entity4 as an adult a @entity7 user who posted pictures purporting to be of @entity4 's killer @entity4 as an adult has been given a 14 - month suspended prison sentence			1
security guard @entity1 was handed the sentence , suspended for 15 months , at @entity13 's @entity12 for a flagrant contempt of court			1
@entity1 , who is from @entity15 and close to the @entity4 family , will also have to pay £ 3,000 in costs			1
he admitted disobeying a january 2001 injunction binding on the whole world which prohibits the publication of any information alleging to identify the appearance , whereabouts , movements or new identities of @entity26 or @entity27 , who were convicted of the two - year - old ’s murder in november 1993			1
it was made on the basis that the pair would face an acute risk of serious physical harm or death upon their release			0
the case was referred by attorney general @entity40 after @entity1 put images purporting to identify @entity26 as an adult on his @entity7 profile on february 14 this year - the 20th anniversary of the crime			1
one image showed @entity26 in a school photograph as a child while below and alongside were different images of an adult male			1
they were accompanied by the tweet : ' its on bbc news about the jon venables pic on twitter saying its been removed eerrm no it has n't			0
' @entity4 ( left ) and @entity27 must not be identified on the basis that the pair would face an acute risk of serious physical harm or death upon their release the attorney general said in a statement : ' it gives me no pleasure to bring a third case for breaching this injunction and i do so purely in the wider public interest			1
' the order has been in place for many years and applies to both media organisations and individuals			0
the picture was posted on the 20th anniversary of @entity4 's death ' it is meant not only to protect @entity26 and @entity27 but also those members of the public who have been incorrectly identified as being either of them			1
' @entity1 's counsel , @entity83 , said the tweet - posted two days after the actual anniversary of @entity1 ’s death - came at a highly emotional time for the community			2
@entity1 , who attended the same school as cousins of the @entity4 family , admitted that he went ' far too far '			1
' he had a very strong emotional reaction to the anniversary			0
' he accepts it is not an excuse for his behaviour but it is offered as some explanation for why he became involved in the very substantial social communication over @entity7 and @entity98 at about that time			0
' he recognises and accepts that , whilst he is entitled to hold his strong views , he was completely wrong to do what he did on that day and was not entitled to take the law into his own hands			0
' he said the court had seen a letter from @entity1 ’s father , @entity105 , which was relevant to the situation and reflected discussions he had had with @entity1			2
lord chief justice @entity109 , sitting with mr @entity110 , said that , after posting the tweet , @entity1 disregarded those who said he was wrong to do so and poured abuse on them			2
he maintained his defiant stance on @entity7 and , the following month , said on @entity98 that he had complete contempt for the police if they were to take action against him			2
he initially denied ownership of the @entity7 account and , even after accepting the postings were his , said he had no knowledge of the injunction			0
@entity1 , who attended the same school as cousins of the @entity4 family , admitted that he went ' far too far ' ' there was an apology but it was substantially undermined by his failure to be candid with the court			1
' lord @entity109 said it was an extremely serious case with a number of serious aggravating features			0
' he acted in flagrant breach of the attorney general 's injunction , knowing of it , and engaged himself in a determined campaign			0
' he knew of the consequences and displayed an attitude to this court , the attorney general and the police of complete contempt			0
' those who suggested he was in breach of the order were subjected to particularly unpleasant abuse			0
' it also appeared that the purpose of his postings was to harm @entity4			2
' the only conceivable mitigation was his admission two days ago that he had known all along and accepted the attorney general 's case in full			0
' suspending the sentence with ' very very considerable hesitation ' , he said the fact that @entity1 was part of the @entity4 family 's community could not conceivably excuse his conduct , but might help to explain it .			1
