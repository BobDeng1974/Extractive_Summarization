by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 12:02 est , 17 march 2014 a @entity3 project allowing people to abandon unwanted babies with no questions asked has been forced to close after it received more than 250 children in the first three months			1
the idea of the baby flap or postbox , a place of safety as an alternative to babies being abandoned on the street , was reintroduced in @entity16 in @entity17 over a decade ago			2
it was based on the medieval concept of foundling wheels , where babies could be left at a convent or monastery to be cared for if the parents were unable to do so			2
but while @entity16 baby postboxes attract only a few cases a year across the entire continent , in @entity3 , where it is illegal to abandon children , they have been inundated with unwanted children			1
the baby ' postbox ' : a scheme in @entity35 in @entity36 allows parents to leave their unwanted children at a designated place with no questions asked shut down : but the baby postbox has been temporarily closed after being undated with three children a day - more than 250 children in just three months the latest project in @entity35 in @entity36 in southern @entity3 follows on from 25 similar projects that have opened up in 10 other @entity3 provinces including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53			1
but the @entity36 ' baby flap ' project has now been forced to temporarily close after 262 mostly disabled babies were handed in within the first three months of the scheme operating			1
@entity58 , 47 , director of the @entity59 , said their baby flap project was massively oversubscribed in comparison to other regions			0
pattern : many of the children left in the postbox were ill or had some form of disability ( stock image ) he said : ' the project in @entity52 only received four abandoned babies 10 months after its establishment and @entity74 received 180 babies in two and a half years after its establishment			1
' yet here in @entity35 we received 262 babies in 90 days			1
' one feature almost all of the abandoned babies have in common is that they are in some way either ill or disabled			0
it includes children with cerebral palsy , @entity89 's syndrome and congenital heart disease			0
@entity58 added : ' we have learned a lot from this even if we stop it now , it shows us that we need to offer better child welfare systems and in particular the assistance and support for families with severely disabled children			0
' it 's also important to encourage information about the options available including options before birth if problems are identified			0
' there also need to be improvements to the relevant rules and promotion of the way that we protect children			0
' the centre will continue to care for the babies that have already been left but have asked that parents do not leave any children in the baby flap after it closes			2
@entity58 , director of the @entity59 , said the city received far more children than other schemes in different parts of the country			0

the scheme in @entity35 , @entity36 , is one of 25 in @entity3
it allows parents to leave unwanted babies at a designated ' baby postbox '
but the @entity35 project was inundated with three babies a day
most of the children were ill or suffering from some form of disability
the project has been forced to close after receiving 262 babies in 90 days
