@entity0 says he is all too accustomed to life in the @entity3 relegation zone – but @entity5 boss @entity4 wants his players to snap from that mindset			1
@entity8 striker @entity0 suffered the drop with both @entity10 and @entity11 and has spent much of his two years at the @entity12 in the bottom three			1
that is again where they reside heading into monday ’s televised trip to @entity18 , and @entity0 admits he is n’t fazed by their position			1
@entity0 in action during @entity5 's previous match - a 0 - 2 loss against @entity24 @entity4 , @entity5 manager , wants to rid his team of their relegation mentality ‘ the clubs i have been at , i 'm used to it , ’ said @entity5 ’s two - goal top scorer			1
‘ the ups and downs , i am used to that kind of thing with being at @entity10 and being at @entity11 , so i kind of just take each day as it comes			1
‘ but there are only a few players who can say they have been used to winning ways - i 'd say that 's @entity39 ( @entity40 ) and @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , maybe @entity43 at some stage at @entity45			2
‘ but if we can put a good run together , we should move out			0
we know we have got the ability to stay in this league , the players we have got , you see it in training every day , some of the performances from the lads			0
‘ but we just need to do it as a team and do it on a saturday , or on a monday			2
obviously if we could be safe before we were last year , it would be a bit better , but we know we have got the team to get through a bad situation , like we showed last year			0
’ the @entity5 squad train this week in preparation for their trip to @entity18 on monday @entity0 ( right ) is used to a relegation dog fight after going down with both @entity10 and @entity11 @entity4 's side have conceded 10 goals in their last two @entity3 matches @entity4 , though , fears there is a lingering mentality of acceptance at the club			1
‘ it is a problem that we have been there for four years , fighting for that , ’ he said			0
‘ it is my challenge to change that - to not have the feeling at this football club or the city that we are going to be always fighting down there			2
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , started the season out of the side but won over his manager to emerge as first - choice striker			1
and the 27 - year - old insists he never lost faith in his own ability			0
‘ i was n't really missing loads of chances – if i was starting to miss chances , then i would start questioning myself , but i was n't , ’ he said			0
‘ maybe i was n't getting into the positions that i was before , i do n't know , but i was n't missing chances , so that did n't affect me			0
‘ but i feel back to the way i did when i signed for @entity5			2
i feel sharp again and able to move again , because there were points last season where i just felt i could n't even get into second gear , so it was hard			0
but i feel good now			0
’ @entity0 and @entity4 would feel a whole lot better were a win at @entity106 to lift them from the bottom three .			1

@entity0 has been relegated with both @entity10 and @entity11
he is therefore not *concerned* about @entity5 's *current* position
@entity4 says he wants to change his side 's relegation mentality
@entity5 travel to @entity18 on monday looking to stop the *rot*
