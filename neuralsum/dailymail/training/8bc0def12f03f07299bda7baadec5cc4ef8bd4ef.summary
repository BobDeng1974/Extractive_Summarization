by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:39 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 18:44 est , 30 september 2013 @entity2 last night criticised the @entity3 for taking credit for tough @entity6 policies designed to curb rampant immigration – while seeking to block them behind the scenes			1
the home secretary pointed out that in a @entity3 campaign handbook the party boasted about cuts in net migration since the election			1
but at the same time , she said , the party ’s ministers were opposing a new bond scheme forcing new arrivals to cough up £ 3,000 before they can enter @entity19			1
outspoken : mrs may made a speech about immigration at the @entity24 conference today the policy , a @entity6 manifesto commitment , would see the surety paid by temporary immigrants from high - risk countries – and the money would then be seized if they failed to leave			1
she said : ‘ our drive to cut immigration has been so successful that even the @entity3 are boasting about it in their campaign handbook			1
‘ i do n’t remember their enthusiasm for cutting immigration when we worked on the policies – so i ’m going to take this with me next time they try to block our reforms			2
‘ the latest policy they ’re fighting is immigration bonds			1
it ’s a simple idea – the government should be able to take a £ 3,000 deposit from temporary migrants and return it when they leave			1
if they overstay their visa , they ’ll lose their money			0
’ she added : ‘ @entity52 were in our manifesto at the last election			2
but the @entity3 suddenly announced that it was their idea			1
‘ then they said they were against them			0
then they said they were for them – but only to help more immigrants to come here			0
now they say they ’re against them after all			0
they were for them , then they were against them , then they were for them and now they ’re against them			0
‘ confused ? do n’t be – the simple conclusion is you can only trust the conservatives on immigration			2
’ mrs may ’s @entity69 colleague @entity68 also used his speech to criticise the @entity3 , questioning the party ’s opposition to human rights reform			2
he said : ‘ i do n’t know why			0
it ’s blindingly obvious the public want change			0
i simply do n’t believe that the majority of the people in this country think that human rights laws are fine as they are			0
’ mr @entity68 announced that next year ministers will publish a draft bill setting out how a @entity6 government would give the @entity84 primacy over @entity86 rulings			2
he said : ‘ our @entity84 should be in @entity19 and not in @entity86			0
and under a @entity24 government it will be			0
’ critical : the home secretary said the @entity3 took credit for immigration bonds , while seeking to block them behind the scenes			1
