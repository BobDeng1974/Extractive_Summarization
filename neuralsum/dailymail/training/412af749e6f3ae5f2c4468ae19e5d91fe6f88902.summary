by @entity0 at last , she was coming back to where she belonged			2
through busy streets , past some of the landmarks of her time in office , @entity3 was returned to @entity8 yesterday , scene of some of her greatest triumphs			1
after so long out of the public eye , the former prime minister was allowed to take centre stage again on this , the first leg of her final journey			2
there were no military bands , no massed crowds lining the streets , and none of the pomp and ceremony that will accompany her funeral today			1
many had arrived by 6.30am but the 30 minutes it took to transport her coffin across @entity42 was a prelude to @entity3 ’s last stand – her return to the @entity29 , the battleground where she made her name			1
it began with her coffin being placed into a standard hearse at a funeral directors ’ headquarters in @entity42 and draped in a @entity53			1
then five motorcycle outriders and a shadowing police helicopter escorted it through the capital ’s busy weekday traffic to a splendid , temporary resting place in readiness for the big day			2
in defiance of the anarchy threatened for her funeral , the journey was punctuated by simple ripples of applause , and even provoked a few cheers along the way			2
cars came to a standstill as drivers realised this was no ordinary procession			2
lining the streets : mourners carrying banners , signs and flags gather along the route , hours in advance sign of respect : @entity83 , 28 , from @entity84 , holds up a sign along the route			2
he grabbed his spot before dawn to ensure a good view of the procession early birds : cameras at the ready , these supporters gathered to pay their final respects to the former prime minister proud police officers take their places outside @entity97 this morning , ahead of the funeral procession tourists , passers - by and a scattering of spectators suddenly found themselves witnessing a moment in history			1
@entity105 among them was artist @entity107 , 57 , holding a symbolic painting of @entity3 and what he called ‘ @entity112 ’s haves and have - nots ’			2
he arrived in @entity112 more than three decades ago from @entity113 and @entity114 when the @entity116 - run country was crippled by strikes and left stinking with uncollected rubbish on the streets			2
‘ i am a socialist , ’ mr @entity120 told me			2
‘ but i know @entity3 had no choice but to do what she did to get the country running again			0
one day , sooner or later , @entity124 will need another @entity3			0
’ arrival : @entity3 's coffin being carried into the @entity29 yesterday ahead of today 's funeral @entity129 ( left ) and his children @entity131 and @entity132 with @entity133 in the background and her partner @entity135 , leaving @entity36 yesterday grandchildren : sir @entity129 's children @entity131 , left , and @entity132 , right , also attended the service in the @entity29 in mourning : @entity133 and her partner @entity135 ( left )			1
@entity129 with his wife @entity141 , leave the home of his late mother , former prime minister @entity3 ( right ) in the distance as he spoke , the hearse was about to pass within sight of @entity147 before driving slowly up to the @entity31 ’ entrance to @entity8			1
here , maybe only by chance , the @entity149 lay briefly in the shadow of a bronze statue of @entity153			1
an undertaker lifted a large wreath – a circle of white roses with a hand - written card inscribed : ‘ @entity159 , always in our @entity160 ’ – from the coffin to allow four pall - bearers in black ties to carry the casket inside			1
and then , moments before @entity167 sounded the hour , she was gone from public view			0
once , @entity3 would have taken her place inside as the dominant figure at the heart of some rowdy commons debate , surrounded by baying enemies and noisy allies			0
now , in a solitary coffin beneath the silent , vaulted emptiness of an ornate crypt , she was alone			1
for the next 18 hours , ahead of today ’s procession to @entity36 ’s , she was scheduled to remain in the marble and stone surroundings of the chapel of @entity28 , deep beneath @entity182			1
return : the body of @entity3 lay overnight in the @entity8 where she served for more than five decades event : hundreds of well - wishers stopped to pay their respects as the hearse passed yesterday escort : police motorbike riders , dressed in black , travelled alongside the hearse on its journey towards @entity8 the chapel spans more than 700 years of history , and yesterday , 87 of them belonged to @entity3			1
they call it @entity8 ’s ‘ hidden gem ’ , a prized jewel in the palace ’s crown			1
like its occupant overnight , it was variously challenged by disaster , reform and betrayal			1
fittingly , perhaps , it once became a hiding place for suffragette @entity207 when , 102 years ago , she secreted herself in a cupboard overnight to be able to record her place of residence for the following day ’s census as the @entity30			1
she did not have the right to vote or to stand for @entity8			1

two years later , she would die after stepping in front of the king ’s horse during the @entity262 as a protest			0
mrs @entity3 would later benefit from miss @entity207 ’s feminist cause by becoming an mp in 1959			0
now the former prime minister – or ‘ stateswoman ( retired ) ’ as her death certificate rather formally described her – lay just a few feet from the brass plaque commemorating the 1911 event			0
she was n’t alone for long though			0
after a private service attended by her close family – including son @entity129 and his children @entity132 , 24 , and @entity131 , 19 , and daughter @entity133 with her boyfriend @entity135 – friends and political associates , a stream of them filed by to pay their respects			1
during the night the speaker ’s chaplain , the @entity280 , kept a vigil			1
soon , friends and supporters from a nation @entity3 helped to shape will be allowed to say goodbye for the last time			0
