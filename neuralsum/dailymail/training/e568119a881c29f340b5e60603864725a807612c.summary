by @entity0 published : 01:09 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 16:19 est , 17 january 2014 a @entity3 traffic court threw out a citation thursday against a woman believed to be the first otorist in the country ticketed for driving while wearing a @entity9 computer - in - eyeglass device			1
commissioner @entity10 ruled that @entity11 was not guilty because she had been cited under a code that requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the device was in operation , which the officer did not provide			2
however , @entity10 did find that the language of the code specifically bars the operation of a video or tv screen or similar device on the front of a vehicle while it is moving - a provision that @entity10 said could be broad enough to apply to @entity9			1
@entity11 , ticketed for driving while wearing @entity9 , a tiny computer mounted on an eyeglass frame , appeared in the @entity32 traffic court the device in a kind of glass - wear frame features a thumbnail - size transparent display above the right eye			1
@entity11 said she was happy she won her case but hoped the court would have ruled that @entity9 is legal to wear while driving whether activated or not			1
' i believe it 's an initial success but we have a long way to go , ' said @entity11 , wearing the device outside the courthouse after the ruling			2
legal experts say the lower court ruling does not set a legal precedent but marks the beginning of a number of cases they expect courts to confront as lawmakers struggle to keep pace with fast - evolving technology			0
' the fun is just starting , ' said @entity59 , a fellow at @entity60			0
@entity62 office @entity61 , left , attorney @entity63 , center along with @entity11 , right , speak during a news conference , thursday , jan. 16 , 2014 in @entity3 @entity3 court commissioner @entity10 shows printed materials used by a @entity62 ( @entity62 ) witness during defendant @entity11 's @entity9 case in @entity3 january 16 , 2014 from driverless cars to wearable devices that can enhance human functions , @entity59 said , there are a host of legal questions to be answered			1
for example , when a @entity76 - operated car is on the road and hits someone , who is responsible - the passenger , car manufacturer or software developer ? @entity11 , a software developer , is among thousands of ' explorers ' who have been selected to try out @entity9 before the technology becomes widely available to the public later this year			1
@entity11 was cited after being pulled over for speeding on a @entity3 freeway in october and the @entity62 officer noticed she was wearing @entity9			1
officer @entity61 , a 10 - year veteran of the @entity62 , testified thursday that the ' hardware for this device was blocking her peripheral vision on her right side , ' and that 's why she sped by his patrol car at 85 mph in her @entity94			0
@entity10 rejected that as speculation , noting that @entity61 had never worn the device			0
he also threw out @entity61 's documentation of her speed and found @entity11 not guilty of that count			2
defendant @entity11 ( @entity100 ) and her lawyer @entity101 speak to the media after appearing in traffic court to win her @entity9 case in @entity3 january 16 , 2014 the commissioner also asked @entity61 to turn off his cellphone after it rang twice interrupting the proceedings			1
@entity11 's attorney @entity101 said the device was not activated when she was driving and the code was irrelevant because it does not specifically state that drivers are barred from using @entity9			2
he said thursday he hopes the case will spur lawmakers to review legislation on the issue , otherwise the code will be open to interpretation by individual courts			0
the lightweight frames are equipped with a hidden camera and tiny display that responds to voice commands			0
the technology can be used to do things such as check email , learn background about something the wearer is looking at , or to get driving directions			0
@entity11 , left , wears a @entity9 computer - in - eyeglass device while her attorney , @entity133 , speaks to the media legislators in at least three states - @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 - have introduced bills that would ban driving with @entity9			1
after the ruling , @entity76 said it has warned early glass adopters to exercise caution			0
' @entity9 is built to connect you more with the world around you , not distract you from it , ' @entity76 said in a statement			0
' explorers should always use @entity9 responsibly and put their safety and the safety of others first			0

@entity11 , a software engineer , was wearing @entity9 when she was pulled over for speeding in @entity3 in october
she was also cited for driving with a visible **monitor** - which is usually given to *people* driving while watching a video or tv **monitor**
