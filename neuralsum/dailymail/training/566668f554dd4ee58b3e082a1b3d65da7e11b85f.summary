@entity0 and @entity1 are looking at a number of state secondary schools for their children @entity5 and wife @entity1 are considering one of @entity8 ’s best all - girls state secondary schools for daughter @entity9 , insisting no one should feel the need to pay for private education			1
the prime minister , who had a privileged schooling at @entity15 , confirmed he is set to become the first @entity17 prime minister to send a child to a state secondary			1
‘ we want to , i have always said that			0
we have been round three or four schools in @entity8 and had a good look , ’ he said			1
‘ my daughter has got a very large say in the matter so she is having a think about what she has seen			1
but there are some good schools to go to			2
’ the @entity30 are understood to have visited @entity31 , an academy in @entity32 , west @entity8 , which is rated ‘ outstanding ’ by education watchdog @entity33			1
a @entity36 school , its former pupils include journalist @entity37 , film director @entity38 and actress @entity39			1
it is heavily oversubscribed , with 67 places each year reserved for girls whose parents have attended services at a @entity36 church at least fortnightly for a minimum of three years			1
the other 53 are given to girls of any or no religion			0
the school , around four miles from @entity50 , also uses ‘ banding ’ by ability to ensure its intake is genuinely comprehensive , with a quarter of girls taken each year being of above average ability , half average and a quarter below average			2
the @entity30 have sent their children to a nearby @entity60 state primary school in @entity61 , which also reserves places for families who are regular churchgoers			2
the prime minister once described his @entity66 faith as being a ‘ bit like the reception for @entity69 in the @entity70 : it sort of comes and goes ’			1
but more recently , he praised the contribution that @entity72 make to society , referred to @entity74 as ‘ our saviour ’ and spoke of the ‘ moments of greatest peace ’ that he has experienced attending the @entity78			0
friends say that mr @entity5 has always had a quiet but profound faith that helped him come to terms with the death of his eldest son @entity83			0
among schools thought to have been visited by the @entity30 is @entity31 in @entity32 , west @entity8 ( pictured ) mr @entity5 and his wife @entity1 have looked at the @entity87 in @entity8 - one of the first comprehensives in the @entity89 other schools the @entity30 are understood to have looked at for 10 - year - old @entity9 to attend next september include @entity91 , an all - girls comprehensive three - quarters of a mile from @entity50			1
the government ’s chief whip and former education secretary @entity95 has sent his daughter @entity96 , who attended the same primary as the @entity5 children , to the school			1
mr @entity5 and his wife have also visited @entity87 – one of the first comprehensives in the @entity89 , where @entity104 grandees such as the late @entity105 sent their children			1
both schools are described as ' ethnically diverse ' and have intakes from some of @entity8 's most deprived areas			2
mrs @entity1 - who was educated at private @entity110 – is said to have told friends she is keen for @entity9 to have a ' normal education '			1
in an interview with @entity115 , the prime minister suggested the government ’s education reforms were designed to make private education redundant			1
‘ if you pay your taxes you should n't have to pay all over again			0
there is no reason why our state schools ca n't be among the best in the world , and some of them are , ’ he said			2
‘ what is exciting is there this change not only in practice but also in culture which is all about excellence and wanting to be the best and wanting to get the best out of every child , and you are now seeing that in more and more schools			2
‘ it ’s about early intervention , intolerance of failure and getting stuck in			0
we know what works now ; it is changing the leadership , changing the curriculum , better discipline , uniforms			0
we can have quite a quick effect			0
the @entity30 have looked at @entity91 for their 10 - year - old daughter @entity9 - the school chosen by the former education secretary @entity95 ( right ) for his daughter @entity96			1
mr @entity5 have also visited @entity87 – where @entity104 's @entity152 was sent the state schools under consideration are a far cry from the establishments attended by mr @entity5 and his wife			1
the prime minister went to @entity15 ( above ) - the most exclusive school in the country ‘ the proof of the pudding is that since 2010 there are a quarter of a million fewer children in failing schools – that is quite a lot of schools			1
this is recognising that in some areas schools slide into failure and not enough happens quickly enough and that is where the regional schools commissioners who tend to be former expert head teachers can get stuck in			2
‘ there are endless debates about how you arrange admissions			0
should we have lotteries ? should we have selections ? in the end , the answer to all these questions is let ’s have more good schools			2
we are introducing more good schools and more good school places through school turnarounds , academies , the free schools			1
we need that to go further and faster			0
’ the prime minister rejected the suggestion that the government ’s exam reforms , which mean less emphasis in coursework , meant less academic children would lose out			1
‘ i do n’t agree with that			0
i think all children will benefit because i think all children deserve to have the fundamentals of a good education			0
i simply do not accept there are some children who ca n’t get a good qualification in @entity207 or @entity208 , ’ he said			0
' i say to my own children “ there is n’t a job in the world where you do n’t need a qualification in @entity207 or @entity208 ”			0
my son said “ what about being a footballer ? ” i said “ you still have to read the contract and count the money ”			0
' @entity1 attended @entity110 in @entity222 - a private boarding school for girls and boys asked how often he sits down with his children and does homework with them , mr @entity5 said : ‘ in a week i will do some help , but @entity1 plays the leading part , i will admit			2
' this morning , i was trying to get one to do guitar practise in one room and the other to do touch typing in the other			0
they were running me ragged because they know that when i am in charge it is not quite so well organised			0
‘ i got there in the end , various threats were … screen time [ on tablets ] in the @entity5 household is severely rationed to try and deliver the effect of homework , but it does n’t always work			0
’ mr @entity5 said he was most inspired at school by @entity249 , one of his history teachers , now 84			2
‘ he was brilliant but used teaching methods that you would not necessarily get away with now			0
he had a wooden block on his desk and if you were n’t concentrating he would fling it across the room at you , ’ the prime minister said			1
education secretary @entity257 told the magazine she had also chosen a state primary for her son			0
' i think you have more good and outstanding [ state ] schools			2
my son is at a good , local village school and there was really no question that was where he went after nursery , ’ she said			0
