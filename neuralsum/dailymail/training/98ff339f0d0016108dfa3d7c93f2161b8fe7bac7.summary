by @entity0 @entity3 's new £ 4.2billion ' super sewer ' will stop the capital returning to the days of the ' @entity5 ' but could see household bills rise by £ 80 , it has been revealed			2
the 15 - mile @entity7 , estimated to cost nearly half of the @entity9 , will take 10 years to build and will be the biggest infrastructure project ever undertaken by the @entity12 water industry			1
it will stretch all the way from @entity15 in @entity3 , along the general path of the @entity17 , towards @entity18 where it will veer north - east to @entity19 near @entity20			1

it is said to be needed to help prevent an average of 55million tonnes of untreated sewage being discharged into the river each year the ' super-sewer ' will stretch all the way from @entity15 in @entity3 , along the general path of the @entity17 , towards @entity18 where it will veer north - east to @entity19 near @entity20 situated 65 metres below the river , and with a capacity of 1.6million cubic metres , the sewer is said to be needed to prevent an average of 55million tonnes of untreated sewage being discharged into the river each year			1
@entity31 has insisted the multi-billion pound project is crucial to stop @entity3 returning to the days of the ' @entity5 ' when the river acted as an open sewer			0
at the time , in the mid- 1880s , residents complained of the smell from the river which was full of raw sewage			0
the problem was eventually solved by engineer sir @entity40 , who built a 1,300 mile network of @entity43 sewers to stop untreated sewage being pumped into the @entity17			1
but , while they have worked well for more than 150 years , @entity7 has now submitted plans for a new system to help combat the rising amount of sewage which overflows from the sewers every year			1
exploratory works for the £ 4.2billion project have already been carried out in the @entity17			0
construction could get underway as early as 2016 if given the go - ahead @entity31 has insisted the multi-billion pound project is crucial to stop @entity3 returning to the days of the ' @entity5 ' when the river acted as an open sewer built from three main construction sites in @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , the @entity7 is expected to help treat some of the 55million tonnes of ' overflow ' raw sewage which the current system can not cope with			1
the new system , if given the official go ahead , will intercept the sewage before it enters the river and carefully treat it before pumping it back into the water in @entity66			0
preparatory construction work could potentially start as early as next year if plans are given the go - ahead – but it will come at a price			0
@entity12 engineer sir @entity40 ( standing top right ) built @entity3 's current drainage system in the 1860 's , but his sewers are now starting to overflow @entity31 estimates that household bills will have to rise by £ 80 a year to finance the sewer , @entity75 reported			2
however , while regulators have questioned the cost of the ' super-sewer ' , sir @entity81 , the great - great - grandson of sir @entity40 , said he supports public investment into the project			2
he told the newspaper : ' these major public works need to be done			0
' if given the green light , preparatory work is expected to begin next year before full construction starts in 2016			0
the project has a targeted completion date of 2023 .			0
