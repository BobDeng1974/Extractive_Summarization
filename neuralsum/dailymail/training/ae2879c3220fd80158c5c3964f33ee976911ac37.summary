by @entity0 and @entity1 a smirking @entity3 last night faced jail after he was convicted of a vile campaign of sexual abuse against teenage girls			1
for the man never shy of supplying a quote in a 50 - year pr career , he was silent when his downfall came and refused to apologise to his victims as he posed for pictures outside court			1
over more than three decades , the millionaire publicist groomed and molested schoolgirls in his yellow @entity17 and young models in his office , threatening them : ‘ no one will believe you			1
above , @entity3 is pictured with his daughter @entity28 outside court after his conviction charged with 11 counts of indecent assault , he was found guilty of eight			1
he was cleared on two other counts , and the jury failed to reach a verdict on another			1
last night one of the schoolgirls he molested told the @entity38 : ‘ it took me and other victims many years to pluck up the courage to seek justice			2
' we were young innocent victims of a powerful , manipulative and dishonest man whom , over the years , we saw become crowned king of the kiss - and - tell industry			0
’ sources close to @entity3 , who spent £ 250,000 on his defence , said he had been urged by close associates several months ago to plead guilty			1
but he had insisted on fighting the charges , convinced he might go free			0
convicted : for the man never shy of supplying a quote in a 50 - year pr career , he was silent when his downfall came and refused to apologise to his victims as he posed for pictures outside court bailed : @entity3 , pictured outside his mansion in @entity59 , was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault by doing so , he prolonged the agony of his victims who were forced to relive their ordeals in the witness box			1
@entity3 is the first celebrity to be convicted under @entity66 , the £ 2.7million @entity67 investigation sparked by the death of @entity69			1
the guilty verdicts will be seen as at least partial vindication by the @entity72 for its controversial pursuit of 1970s celebrities , following a string of recent acquittals			0
@entity3 was branded a grade - a paedophile and ‘ every little girl ’s worst nightmare ’ during his eight - week trial at @entity82 ’s @entity81			2
centre of attention : @entity3 was cleared on two other counts , and the jury failed to reach a verdict on another denial : @entity3 insisted on fighting the charges , convinced he might go free			1
in doing so , he prolonged the agony of his victims who had to relive their ordeals in the witness box			0
above , he leaves @entity81 the pr agent , who turned 71 during the case , sat emotionless in the dock wearing an open - necked shirt as the verdicts were given			0
his disabled 42 - year - old daughter @entity28 also showed no emotion in the public gallery – she had given evidence in his defence , but prosecutors said she was tainted by her blind loyalty to her father			0
freed on bail , outside court @entity3 was asked repeatedly if he would say ‘ sorry ’ to his victims			1
he smiled awkwardly but said , uncharacteristically , that his lawyers had told him ‘ to say nothing at all ’			0
younger days : during the trial , @entity3 admitted attending sex parties in his youth @entity3 had denied all the allegations and called his victims ‘ mentally disturbed ’ fantasists hunting compensation			1
their accusations were ‘ a fairy story that only you believe , ’ he had snapped to the prosecutor			0
but after nine days of deliberations , the jury of six men and four women believed the women , finding @entity3 guilty of eight counts of indecent assault : four against a 15 - year - old in 1977 , one on a 19 - year - old in 1981 or 1982 , two against a 17 - year - old in 1982 or 1983 , and one on an 18 - year - old in the early 1980s			1
he was cleared of another two allegations – one 18 - year - old who said she was pushed up against a wall in his central @entity82 offices when he groped her and kissed her in 1975 , and another , aged 19 , who claimed she was groped in a taxi in 1979			0
the jury could not reach a verdict on a count involving a woman who claimed he groped her in his car after meeting her at a wimpy bar in @entity82 in 1966			2
in fact , there were 23 victims who came forward to police , but prosecutors decided to proceed with what they perceived to be the seven strongest cases			0
@entity3 will be sentenced on friday			1
the maximum sentence for indecent assault was two years at the time the offences were committed			1
he was bailed on the condition he spends nights at his £ 3.5million @entity59 mansion			0
the judge told him : ‘ you must realise that the fact i have given you bail is no indication of what the final sentence will be			0
’ last night @entity166 , deputy chief crown prosecutor for @entity82 , said the verdicts ‘ provide a long - denied justice to the victims of serious sexual offences ’			2
many of the victims had told family or friends about their assaults up to 40 years ago , showing they had not made them up in what @entity3 termed ‘ the current climate ’			2
leaving court : @entity3 is the first celebrity to be convicted under @entity66 , the £ 2.7million @entity67 investigation sparked by the death of @entity69			1
above , the publicist is pictured leaving court by car from his twenties to his forties , the manipulative fixer boasted of his celebrity contacts to snare naïve young women , promising to make them bond girls or leading ladies in @entity191 movies			2
he played mind games with his victims , using hoax phone calls to trick them into thinking they were speaking to famous directors			0
he treated his new bond street offices as his ‘ sexual fiefdom ’ and wandered around naked demanding sordid favours from visitors and secretaries alike			0
@entity203 ’s extraordinary defence was that he enjoyed so much sex by cheating on his first wife @entity205 with numerous mistresses that he did not need to abuse anyone			0

above , he arrives home he attended orgies with sex siren @entity226 and was later the ‘ ringmaster ’ host of his own ‘ good honest filth ’ parties			0
like @entity69 , he used his lifetime of ‘ tireless ’ charity work to mask his true colours as a sexual predator			0
@entity3 ’s refusal to accept his guilt was his downfall			2
after his initial arrest in 2012 , he said ‘ anyone who really knew me all those years ago ’ would know he was innocent			0
instead , it provoked more women to come forward and seal his fate			0
to complete his humiliation , the size of @entity3 ’s penis became a central feature of the case , with one woman calling it ‘ freakishly small ’			2
