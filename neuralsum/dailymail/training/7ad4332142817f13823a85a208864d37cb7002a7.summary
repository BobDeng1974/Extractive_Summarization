imagine having an under - bite so severe you could barely chew			1
for one 21 - year - old woman , that was a fact of life - until she underwent a major jaw realignment surgery four years ago in @entity6 that not only corrected her bite , but also completely transformed her appearance			1
i was afraid to smile and could n't even look at my own reflection in the mirror without getting distraught , ' said @entity13 , who goes by the moniker @entity14 on @entity15			1
' i was depressed and battled with substance - abuse problems because of it			0
' before ! @entity13 , who goes by the name @entity14 on @entity15 , had an under bite so severe she could barely chew			1
in these photos , her jaw is actually closed ; in the photo on the left , the lower protrusion is caused by her teeth and after ! after her surgery , @entity13 's look was completely transformed , but she said it took about a year for her jaw to stop feeling ' fragile ' @entity13 , who was 17 when she got her surgery , had to have her lower jaw moved back , her upper jaw moved forward , and her chin realigned			1
she had to have a total of 12 screws permanently placed in her mouth during the procedure			0
she posted her before and after photos on @entity15 - and the change was so noticeably drastic that the post quickly moved to the top of the site and garnered more than 1,000 comments			1
the response to her story and photos was almost entirely positive , with many users asking for advice about getting the surgery themselves and others leaving accounts of their own experiences			2
@entity13 had to have the surgery for medical reasons , but said she found ' the mental health benefits to be much more immense			1
' before the procedure , she suffered bullying at the hands of her classmates - and said that the physical appearance of her jaw was one of the main reasons she underwent the surgery when she did			2
' my classmates were relentlessly cruel , ' she said			0
' i feel so much happier and stronger now because of everything that has happened though			0
' @entity13 would 've liked to get the surgery done earlier , but could n't because her bones were still growing			1
her surgeon even thought 17 was too soon , but over-corrected her bit by a few millimeters to account for future growth			0
wow ! @entity13 posted another before and after , this time showing her profile - and the change is drastic ouch ! @entity13 , who 's pictured here immediately following her surgery , said she would n't recommend the procedure to others unless it was ' absolutely necessary ' because of the expense and long recovery time making progress ! five days after the surgery , @entity13 started getting feeling back in her mouth and jaw area when @entity15 users asked if they should get the surgery done , @entity13 said she would n't recommend it unless it was ' absolutely necessary ' because of the expense and long recovery time			1
' i spent two or three nights in the hospital after the procedure , ' she wrote			0
' i could have stayed for less , but i had an abnormal amount of bleeding , so they had to keep tubes in my mouth and my nose			0
also , i was so sore and drugged up that i could n't bring myself to drink , so they kept me for monitoring until i was more conscious and willing			2
' she said it would take or two or three weeks unless she could even open her jaw the slightest bit - and she had to wear rubber - bands in her mouth to ensure she did n't over-extend her jaw			2
it was n't for nearly two months that she could fully open her mouth			2
heavy metal ! @entity13 had to wear large rubber bands in her mouth to ensure she did n't over-extend her jaw and also to help re-build the muscle already showing progress ! even 12 days after the surgery , the change is noticeable still smiling ! four years after the surgery , @entity13 says she is ' happy , healthy and about to start [ her ] master 's degree ' it took about a year , @entity13 says , before her face did n't feel fragile			1
now , four years later , her jaw feels 100per cent back to normal - and she has all but forgotten about the pins in her mouth			0
the only time she thinks about them when she 's getting x-rays , though she is n't sure they would n't set off metal detectors			0
' today , i am happy , healthy and about to start my master 's degree , ' she says .			0
