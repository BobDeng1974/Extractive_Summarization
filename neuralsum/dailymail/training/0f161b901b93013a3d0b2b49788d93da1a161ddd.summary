middle - class parents are to be forced to pay hundreds of pounds a year into pensions for their nannies			1
tens of thousands of families will see the cost of their childcare rise by as much as £ 600 a year from 2015 , it has emerged			2
under the @entity10 scheme , they will also have to fund pension contributions for cleaners , gardeners and home helps whose pay exceeds £ 9,440 a year			1
squeezed middle : the cost of childcare could rise by as much as £ 600 a year for a family paying for a nanny as they are auto - enrolled in the new scheme parent groups say this will add to the burden on the already - squeezed middle , with mothers accusing the government of treating parents ‘ like a profitable business ’			1
there are an estimated 111,484 nannies working in the @entity32 , according to the @entity33			1
and soaring numbers of families employ domestic help , including cleaners and gardeners			1
more than six million people were employing domestic help in 2011 , a rise of a million compared with a decade earlier			2
now , under the government ’s auto - enrolment scheme – the biggest shake - up to pensions for a century – every employer will have the responsibility of enrolling their staff into a pension scheme			1
the rules , which came into force for big businesses last october and are gradually being extended to smaller firms , will see more than 11million workers enrolled into a company pension for the first time , with both employee and employer paying contributions , initially at 1 per cent			1
empty pram : parent groups such as @entity60 say the enforced pension - enrollment will mean families will not be able to afford childcare from as early as june 2015 it will be rolled out to those who might not consider themselves employers , such as families who take on help with cleaning , childcare or gardening			1
they will be legally bound to offer a pension to anyone aged over 22 but below the state pension age who they pay above the tax threshold – currently £ 9,440 a year			1
by the time the rules are fully implemented by 2018 , contributions will rise to 3 per cent			2
for someone who employs a full - time nanny earning £ 25,000 a year , this would push up their childcare bill by £ 48 a month			1
@entity60 website founder @entity86 said childcare issues were an ‘ enormous problem ’ and a rise in costs could prevent parents going back to work			2
‘ the high cost of childcare is one of the most frequent concerns of @entity60 users , ’ she said			0
parents have been told by the head of @entity100 to ‘ get off their backsides ’ and register for tax self - assessment			1
@entity104 said hundreds of thousands of people could be caught out by the changes to child benefit			0
families receiving the benefit where one person earns £ 50,000 or more are meant to register by today			0
households where one person earns more than £ 60,000 will have to pay back all their child benefit in income tax if they have not already opted out of receiving it			0
mrs @entity104 told @entity115 : ‘ we think there ’s about 200,000 people who need to get off their backsides and do something			0
’ people who do not register could face fines of between 10 per cent and 100 per cent of the child benefit paid			0
however , it is unlikely that anyone who registers and pays the tax by january 31 will be penalised			0
‘ @entity100 is committed to helping people pay the right amount of tax and urges parents who have been affected by the changes to child benefit to register for self - assessment , ’ said mrs @entity104			1
she advised anyone unsure whether they are affected by the change to go to the @entity100 website , adding : ‘ we know that lots of people leave it until the last minute			0
’ many of those affected had already opted out , she said			0
@entity143 , of the @entity144 , said : ‘ this adds considerable complication to the tax system for ordinary people , particularly for those brought into the self - assessment system for the first time			1
’ @entity153 general secretary @entity152 said some parents who are not affected had still received letters from @entity100 telling them to register			0
‘ the changes to child benefit are a mess , ’ she said			0
‘ the coming requirement to contribute towards pension as well as to cover tax and @entity162 will only make it harder for parents			1
‘ on @entity60 people often cite the cost as a barrier to returning to work – for many once you ’ve paid tax and contributed to a pension it will simply not be worth it			2
’ there are also fears that many families will try to duck the extra payments by paying their nannies ‘ under the table ’ or making them self - employed			1
@entity178 , director of the @entity179 , said : ‘ we are already seeing a growing problem of parents trying to cut costs by paying nannies cash in hand or illegally forcing them to become self - employed			1
' it is highly likely we will see those same people trying to get round the pensions changes as well			0
’ on @entity60 , mothers attacked the new pension scheme			1
one wrote : ‘ it will tip me over the edge and put one nanny out of work			0
‘ people will put their nanny on the books for some £ 500 per month , call her an au pair and then pay the rest in cash			0
proper on - the - books nannies will become a privilege of the rich			1
treating parents like a profitable business is outrageous			0
’ @entity210 mp @entity209 said : ‘ £ 600 may not seem like a lot of money to some people but in hard - pressed families it could well be the straw that breaks the camel ’s back			2
they may be forced to take on full - time childcare themselves			2
’ colleague @entity219 , who has paid into a pension for his family ’s nanny for years , said : ‘ i imagine very few people are aware of the scheme			1
’ some families could be forced to sack their nannies , he said			2
‘ it is a question of balancing between the need to provide for people in retirement and the need to provide now			0
’ as well as a financial strain , setting up a pension is likely to prove a time - consuming and laborious process for families with domestic help			1
first they must register with the @entity238 and find out what date they need to comply with the rules by			0
then they must find a scheme , open an account and write to their employee telling them they are going to be signed up			2
failure to stick to the rules can result in penalties of up to £ 50 a day or even prosecution			0
families who have employed their nanny prior to april 2012 will have to pay into the pension scheme from as early as june 2015			1
those who have enlisted a nanny since then will not have to pay until 2017			0
@entity255 , of tax consultancy @entity256 , said : ‘ i know it really sticks in people ’s throats			0
we ’ve got a pensions time - bomb ticking away and somebody has to pay for it			2
’ ' automatic enrolment is the biggest change to the pensions system in a century - aimed at addressing a culture of serious under - saving for later life , ' @entity269 spokesperson said			2
' over the next five years more than 1 million employers will provide their staff with the chance to save for their retirement , many for the first time			0
' nannies , as employees , will also be able to benefit from the reforms , and we would encourage families hiring them to look into how to prepare			1
' reliable and affordable childcare is vital for parents who want to stay in or return to work , which is why from 2015 the government will introduce new tax free childcare which will be worth up to £ 1,200 per child annually			0

new @entity10 scheme sees employees auto - enrolled on pension
this includes home - help such as nannies , gardeners and cleaners
parent groups attack scheme saying it ' targets the squeezed middle '
