the @entity0 presidential election - becoming a bigger circus by the day – has another candidate with former world footballer of the year @entity4 surprisingly deciding to stand on the eve of the deadline			1
however @entity4 entering the crowded race has more to do with the tactical machinations going on between @entity0 's @entity9 and @entity11 's @entity10 than the @entity13 football great having any noted sporting political ambitions – even with compatriot @entity15 's endorsement			1
the @entity11 game plan is to crowd the election hustings with as many ' credible ' candidates as possible so that the anti @entity22 agenda is heard loudly in as many places as possible before the ballot on may 29			1
@entity4 surprisingly announced his intention to stand against @entity22 to become @entity0 president @entity11 want to flood the presidential vote with anti @entity22 candidates so word of the unhappiness spreads this is seen as the best way of destabilising @entity22 , who is seeking a ludicrous fifth term and already has enough promised votes from the 209 territories to practically guarantee him victory			1
such is the way that @entity11 are spreading their bets that they have welcomed the bizarre decision by the @entity41 to support prince @entity42 when @entity11 are now fielding @entity44 's @entity43 and @entity4			1
and it will not go un-noticed by @entity47 stunt funded @entity48 that @entity4 has just cut his links with @entity51 betting company @entity50			2
@entity52 have pledged their backing to @entity55 having supported @entity22 in 2011 on proviso that it would be his last term – which it is n't			2
@entity58 , the most fanciful of candidates for the @entity0 presidency , is having to rely on former colleague @entity22 - if he sees fit - gifting him the necessary five nominations needed to stand			1
@entity62 has failed to garner enough support despite spending a year on the campaign trail and sending out regular dreary policy statements			0
@entity58 needs @entity22 to gift him five nominations to stand against him as a candidate so who - if anyone - will want to read an entire book about his way forward for @entity0 being published in @entity73 this week			1
the @entity74 fast tracking their tv rights auction over the next fortnight to ensure broadcast regulator @entity77 did not derail the expected £ 5 billion bonanza was reported by @entity79 last saturday			0
now @entity80 , whose initial complaint about the cost of tv matches instigated the @entity77 probe , have asked @entity77 to force the @entity74 to postpone the auction until the investigation is completed			0
@entity77 said last : ' we aim to reach a decision in a matter of days '			0
but @entity77 themselves could have decided a lot earlier in the process to order the delay and the timing of @entity80 's request was described as ' self - serving ' by the @entity74			2
and the @entity74 , who would bring in lawyers asap if challenged , say there is ' no legal basis whatsoever for any interference			0
swimming is one of the sports who have satisfied @entity106 that improved systems and governance justify a return to multi-year support rather than one - year only grants			0
@entity106 's delayed @entity112 on whose findings they rely to a massive extent for their grass - roots funding decision - making , will finally be announced today			2
the figures will be particularly sensitive around the two national sports , football and cricket where 11 - a - side participation has been in worrying decline			0
but overall football and cricket 's @entity112 numbers will be up today			0
. @entity127 faces an explosive board meeting at the @entity129 on thursday the @entity41 board meeting today is likely to be an explosive affair after the @entity74 – represented at @entity132 by @entity133 and @entity134 – rejected @entity127 's @entity106 commission - led initiative to scrap work permit appeals			1
@entity139 regulations require a consensus within @entity142 football for such a change			0
as limiting overseas players was a central plank of @entity127 's strategy for improving the national team , this issue is sure to cause ructions			1
panned referee @entity150 , who did n't spot two blatant @entity151 stamping offences during the @entity154 semi-final as well as missing a clear penalty , may need the services of pr consultancy @entity157 hired by @entity41			2
@entity150 has been criticised for his refereeing display in @entity160 's win over @entity161 the big - spending county @entity41 's chief executive is @entity164 , father of @entity43 who heads the referees academy			1
and @entity43 's partner and female ref @entity168 was subject to sexist remarks from county vice-president @entity170 that led to his four - month ban from the game .			0

@entity4 's @entity0 presidential candidacy is part of a bigger plan from @entity11
@entity58 may only stand if @entity22 gifts him nominations
@entity127 could be set for an explosive @entity41 board meeting on thursday
