from @entity3 ’s watery eyes to the stress - lined face of @entity7 ’s worried boss , a mood of sombre reflection fell upon the paddock ahead of the @entity10 @entity9			1
@entity9 racing drivers — as competitive a breed as exists in sport — thought of their colleague , and in some cases friend , who remains desperately ill after suffering head injuries when he crashed into a recovery vehicle in @entity21 last sunday			1
the words they spoke were measured			0
they offered no quick fixes			0
they refused to point fingers			0
the only driver who broke ranks was @entity30 , @entity32 ’s @entity31 , who described the accident as ‘ totally unacceptable ’			1
@entity30 , pictured riding at the @entity36 circuit in @entity10 , has called @entity7 's crash ' totally unacceptable ' @entity38 and @entity39 ( right ) will carry the message ' @entity41 ' s at this weekend 's @entity10 @entity9 @entity42 and @entity43 are among the drivers who will display an ' everybody with @entity41 ' sticker @entity49 driver @entity47 sporting the ' everyone with @entity41 ' sticker on his crash helmets he added : ‘ we have to look for answers from the @entity55			1
we have to make sure they hear us			0
we will go through the full detail			0
in future when there is a tractor coming to pick up a car , we need a safety car no matter what the conditions			1
’ so why did not one of the other 21 other drivers speak even a small fraction as vehemently as @entity30 about the circumstances surrounding the crash ? they were under instruction not to from the @entity71 — the drivers ’ association — and team bosses			1
without doubt it was in part because criticising the @entity55 has never been politically expedient			2
that is how @entity79 works			0
there was also , it seemed , a genuine desire not to betray their sport by airing their private concerns in public at such a sensitive time			0
as @entity94 , the most experienced driver on the grid , said : ‘ i ca n’t say anything yet			2
most of us understand that being massively outspoken now , or letting our emotion get the better of us , does n’t always help the situation			0
‘ it ’s better to sit down , when you know all the facts , make improvements and speak out accordingly			2
that ’s not the case right now			0
it ’s just a very emotional time , thinking of @entity41 and his family			0
’ the scene following the aftermath of @entity7 's horror crash in the closing stages of the @entity21 @entity9 the 25 - year - old @entity109 is fighting for his life after sustaining brain injuries after his crash with the tractor the @entity71 drivers , who number about 18 , will instead meet on friday night in the paddock to discuss their suggestions for safety improvements			1
among the issues on the agenda is likely to be whether the safety car should always be deployed when a tractor is removing a car , such as happened on sunday when @entity7 hit the tractor that was there to remove @entity125 ’s @entity124			1
the timing of races to avoid dusk is likely to be another topic of debate			0
the usual pre-race driver briefing with race director @entity132 will also be held tonight			0
@entity55 president @entity133 , who has ultimate responsibility for safety , was due to arrive in @entity36 on thursday night and is expected to hold a press conference on friday , addressing the implications of the crash , after asking @entity132 for a full report			1
the shock of sunday ’s events was no more palpable than at @entity142 , where chief executive @entity143 spoke of 25 - year - old @entity7 as ‘ not only an exceptional driver , but an exceptional human being ’			1
@entity143 , clearly worn down by events but still lucid , said the team still had not decided whether to race in @entity10			1
although they met the 4pm deadline to register their drivers — @entity151 and reserve driver @entity152 — they may yet withdraw one or both			0
they will be guided in this by the wishes of @entity7 ’s parents and , conceivably , by his condition			2
another possible consideration is @entity151 ’s state of mind and readiness to drive after he missed his usual media engagements yesterday			0
the 21 drivers will carry the message ‘ @entity165 ’ ( all with @entity41 ) on their helmets in sunday ’s race			1
their sense of anguish was felt deeply by @entity170 ’ @entity3 , a friend of @entity7 , who called the @entity21 @entity9 , ‘ the worst race of my life ’			1
this from a man who was seriously injured when a spring from @entity175 ’s @entity174 hit him in the head while driving a @entity38 in the @entity177 @entity9 five years ago			2
‘ i did n’t remember that accident , ’ said @entity3 of his own knockout blow			2
‘ maybe tomorrow in practice it will get a little bit better because at least you are working , at least you have something to think about , some issue to put inside your brain			0
’ @entity7 's name will be above the @entity190 garage ahead of the weekend 's race in @entity36 the issue of enclosed cockpits is another subject for the sport to consider			1
but would even a fighter - jet style canopy have saved @entity7 , when he hit a steel truck at a speed seemingly in excess of 100mph ? there is also the question of @entity79 ’s heritage			2
‘ there are positives , ’ said @entity94 of canopies , ‘ but this is @entity79 and it has been open cockpits since the start of time			2

@entity7 fighting for his life after freak crash during @entity21 @entity9
@entity109 careered into tractor recovering @entity125 's @entity124
@entity30 has called on the @entity55 to introduce a safety car on every *occasion* a recovery vehicle is used during a race
@entity71 drivers are set to meet to discuss safety improvements
@entity142 chief has not decided if team will race at the @entity10 @entity9
21 drivers will carry the message ‘ @entity229 ’ on their helmets
