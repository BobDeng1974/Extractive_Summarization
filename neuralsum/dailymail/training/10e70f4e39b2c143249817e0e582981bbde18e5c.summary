she said : ' he 's not depressed			0
he has the anger of someone who has suffered an injustice			1
' he just has a dream			0
he wants to make the country free			0
' @entity2 is what made me fall in love with him , he 's not born to be alone and enjoy his wealth			0

' two months ago , miss @entity8 gave an interview to a glossy @entity3 weekly in which she revealed she had first fallen in love with 77 - year - old @entity2 when she was a teenage activist in his @entity87 party			1
there were unconfirmed reports last month that the two had married and they have been pictured several times cosying up together at various restaurants , as well as in the stands at @entity72 's @entity95 stadium			0
@entity87 party 's supporters wave flags as @entity2 addresses a rally in @entity18 senators voted to expel @entity2 after he was convicted earlier this year of tax fraud and sentenced initially to four years jail , which was later reduced to 12 months community service			1
although technically he can no longer serve as a politician , the three times @entity104 has vowed he will continue to be a vocal force in politics from the sidelines , with his newly launched @entity87 party			2
before the vote , he claimed he had new documents which would prove he was innocent of tax fraud and urged senators to delay the vote so they could look at them and clear him , but they ignored his appeals and it has since emerged the evidence is flawed			2
three - times married @entity2 has always insisted that he is the ' most persecuted man since @entity121 ' and that he is being deliberately targeted by left wing magistrates who are out to get him			0
besides his tax fraud conviction , he was also found guilty in the summer of having sex with an underage prostitute and abuse of office which resulted in a seven year prison sentence which has gone to an automatic appeal .			2
