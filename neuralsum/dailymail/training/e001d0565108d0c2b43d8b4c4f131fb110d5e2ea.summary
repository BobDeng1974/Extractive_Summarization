' it had been a lovely day we were outside cleaning the car			2
i then heard this almighty scream and saw the dog biting my daughters face			1
' she had a chunk of flesh torn from her face it was the worst thing i have ever seen ' she has not been the same since the attack , she gets very shy and seems to have no confidence and what ’s more she might have permanent scarring on her face			1
' so when the court ruled we were just to get £ 250 i was sickened			2
' my little girl could have died if i had not intervened			2
this is a hugely traumatic moment in her life but it seems as though that does n’t really matter it the eyes of the court			0
