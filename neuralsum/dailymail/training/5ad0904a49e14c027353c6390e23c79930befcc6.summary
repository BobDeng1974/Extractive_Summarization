@entity1 , a minister in the @entity11 government , almost collided with the eastern grey kangaroo , which was grazing on a front lawn in a @entity15 suburb			1
' we both got a nasty fright , and of course when kangaroos are startled , they lash out , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' as the kangaroo sought to escape , it landed on me , and its claws dug into my leg			2
' mr @entity1 , 41 , says the 4ft 7in kangaroo left him with two deep scratches to his left leg and bruising to his right leg			1
moments later , a passer - by spotted the minister on the ground in @entity33 and drove him home			0
he was taken to hospital and given a tetanus shot			0
' the nurse who treated me had treated someone before who had been scratched by a kangaroo and ended up with a very bad infection , ' he said			0
' so she was quite keen to give it a good clean - out			0
' mr @entity1 arrived at the @entity11 parliament yesterday three hours after his encounter , and found most of his colleagues were more concerned about the kangaroo 's welfare than his			1
' i can assure people that the kangaroo is fine , ' he said			0
' it was last seen hopping off into the distance quite comfortably			0

' the @entity77 have not opposed that cull			0
' i really enjoy seeing kangaroos and we 're very lucky in @entity15 to have them as part of our neighbourhoods , but i usually prefer to keep them at a bit more of a distance than this , ' he said			2
