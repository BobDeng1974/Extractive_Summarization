@entity0 was the architect of the post-war financial system , which paved the way for the @entity3 to dominate the 20th century and win the @entity4			2
but it has now emerged that the brilliant economist was in fact a staunch anti-capitalist who privately praised the @entity9 's communism			0
documents unearthed at @entity11 prove that , although @entity0 devoted his life to strengthening western capitalism , he secretly despised the system he had created and believed it would eventually be overtaken by the state - controlled economy of the @entity9 and its allies			1
the flawed genius did not live long enough to find out just how wrong he was , as he died in 1948 , before both the decades - long boom enjoyed by the @entity21 and @entity22 and the slow decline of the @entity24			0
@entity0 , assistant secretary of the treasury , was accused of providing information to the @entity9			1
he appeared before the @entity26 in august , 1948 the astonishing revelation of @entity0 's communist sympathies finally explains why he agreed to spy on his own country for the @entity9 even while representing @entity21 at the 1944 @entity31 conference which would determine the post-war economic order			1
even though the conference ensured a postwar global financial climate dominated by the @entity35 , @entity0 is thought to have been feeding information to @entity37 for years			2
while @entity0 's espionage has been an open secret and acknowledged by presidents from @entity42 to @entity43 , historian @entity38 discovered new notes from the economist 's @entity11 archives dating from 1944 - when he was at the height of his powers in the administration of president @entity50			2
the essay , headed ' political - economic int. of @entity53 ' , outlines a post-war world where the @entity9 socialist model of economic planning takes over from the @entity21 liberal capitalist one , according to an article by mr @entity38 in foreign affairs			1
@entity60 , the famous @entity62 economist was outwitted by @entity0 at the @entity31 conference of 1944 @entity21 delegates attending the the @entity65 , ( l - r , standing ) : assistant secretary of treasury @entity0 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity72 congressman @entity71			1
front row , seated : senator @entity74 , @entity76 congressman @entity75 , secretary of treasury @entity77 , and @entity80 senator @entity79 the unpublished notes argue that the @entity3 has demonized the @entity9 , and dreams of a strong alliance between the @entity21 and their communist rivals that would create a new world order			1
in his essay , @entity0 predicts that ' the change will be in the direction of increased control over industry , and increased restrictions on the operations of competition and free enterprise '			0
extraordinarily , he concludes : ' @entity96 is the first instance of a socialist economy in action			0
and it works ! ' @entity0 was one of the greatest economic minds in history , but he might have been bitterly disappointed with his legacy			0
he was arguably the most influential figure at the @entity65 in @entity31 , @entity80 in july 1944 , where the @entity106 nations met to hammer out the shape of global economy after the @entity110			2
the conference established the principle that open markets were the best way to ensure prosperity , paving the way for the globalisation we have seen over the past decades			0
among the specific steps delegates took , led by @entity0 , was the establishment of the @entity121 and the forerunner of the @entity123			2
these twin financial institutions have played an important role in encouraging poorer countries to liberalise their economies by giving them access to credit and insisting they participate in global business networks			0
while many believe this capitalist system is responsible for the world 's unprecedented prosperity , it has now emerged that even though @entity0 helped create it he was in fact a communist sympathiser who believed that state - controlled economies would be more successful than capitalist ones			1
@entity0 had clearly deluded himself about the repressive nature of the @entity9 government , claiming that officials had guaranteed the freedom of religion and denying that the @entity9 intended to meddle in the affairs of other countries			1
@entity0 's communism is far from his image as the capitalist hero who so outmaneuvered the @entity62 and their legendary economist @entity60 that they ended up agreeing to the dollar being the currency of the @entity121 and @entity123 instead of the pound			0
the @entity31 conference comprised 730 delegates from all 44 @entity106 nations , including the @entity9 , and even though @entity0 emerged as an @entity21 hero he had already begun feeding the @entity96 information for most of that year			1
among the consequences of the conference were the creation of the @entity121 and the @entity123 , two institutions which have been integral to the spread of liberal capitalism around the globe			2
by contrast , soon after the end of the war the @entity9 started to fall behind the @entity21 and fast - growing @entity22 , and within three decades was significantly poorer than its western rivals			1
@entity0 made such an impact at @entity31 that on january 23 , 1946 , president @entity42 nominated @entity0 to be the first @entity21 executive director of the @entity121 and he was widely tipped to become the fund 's managing director			1
however , by this time fbi director @entity179 had begun to investigate @entity0 , and the paranoid law enforcement chief placed him under investigation for two months after colleagues became concerned about his political beliefs			0
the investigation proved fruitful and @entity179 presented a report to @entity42 that included information from 30 sources , including confessed spy @entity187 saying that @entity0 was a ' a valuable adjunct to an underground @entity9 espionage organization			1
' @entity0 fell under the suspicions of @entity191 chief @entity179 in 1946 - who unearthed the first evidence that the treasury official was a spy keen to keep tabs on @entity0 should he only be the tip of the iceberg , @entity179 stressed to the president that the @entity191 's findings remain secret			0
indeed , the day that @entity179 's report was delivered on february 5 , the @entity201 approved @entity0 ’s nomination to the @entity121			0
alarm bells rang in the @entity205 and when secretary of state @entity206 read the report he wanted @entity42 to immediately withdraw the nomination and have @entity0 arrested as did treasury secretary @entity67			0
regardless , @entity42 still had a healthy distrust of @entity179 and instead of allowing @entity0 to ascend to @entity121 managing director kept him as executive director			0
knowing that appointing another @entity21 above @entity0 would alert him and his @entity9 handlers , @entity42 searched for a solution he could feasibly pass off			1
this came when @entity67 met with the venerable @entity60 , who was the @entity62 governor of both the @entity121 and the @entity123			0
he said that @entity42 was not going to insist on an @entity21 head of the @entity121 but instead wanted an @entity21 head of the @entity123			0
@entity217 at the @entity218 --- his network of spies across the @entity222 allied nations was enormous in the aftermath of the @entity110 and included @entity0 at the @entity21 @entity224 this shocked @entity60 , but it set up the precedence that continues to this day of an @entity21 head of the @entity123 and a @entity22 head of the @entity121			1
ultimately though it worked in not alerting the @entity9 that they might be onto @entity0 and he resigned the next year from the @entity121 in 1947			1
the following summer , in august 1948 , @entity0 was officially accused of spying for the @entity9 and brought before the @entity26			1
he denied all the charges and died of a heart attack three days later - which many suspect was brought on by the stress of the hearings			0
following the trial and conviction of @entity238 in 1950 , who was fundamental in the founding of the @entity241 , representative @entity43 revealed a handwritten memo of @entity0 ’s given to him by @entity243 , apparently showing that @entity0 had passed classified information for transmission to the @entity9			2
however , @entity0 's ultimate guilt was established by declassified @entity9 documents in the 1990s and in 1997 , the bipartisan @entity248 , chaired by @entity250 senator @entity249 , stated in its findings : ' the complicity of @entity238 of the @entity253 seems settled			2
as does that of @entity0 of the @entity224			0

@entity0 represented @entity21 at @entity31 conference in 1944
helped create the institutions which led to capitalism taking over the world
but he *harboured* communist views and dreamed of @entity9 domination
