glasses might be helpful for improved vision , but a new type are being tested that allow wearers to be invisible in unwanted photographs			0
invisibility glasses by @entity7 , a software security company , were designed in a bid to help protect people 's online identities in the digital age			1
with the increased use of cell phone cameras in public , the glasses makes it difficult to capture a person 's identity in facial recognition software , for example the kind used on @entity21			1
invisibility glasses by @entity7 , a software security company , were created in a bid to help protect people 's online identities in the digital age			1
with the increased use of cell phone cameras in public , the glasses make it difficult to capture a person 's identity in facial recognition software , for example the kind used on @entity21 the glasses , through the use of infrared light and retro - reflective materials , blocks attempts to get a clear facial capture of the wearer , developers claim the wearable technology , which does not hide the rest of the person 's body , debuted on sunday at technology showcase @entity42 in @entity44 , according to @entity45			1
the developers of the privacy glasses , @entity48 , said that with the advancement in facial recognition technologies like @entity21 's @entity52 system , they began investigating how technology can be used when it comes to securing online privacy			1
@entity56 will be able to determine whether two captured faces are of the same person with 97.25 per cent accuracy			0
and this coupled with other advancements left developers questioning how to combat privacy			0
the glasses , through the use of infrared led light and retro - reflective materials , block a clear facial capture of the wearer , developers claim			1
the retro - reflective materials on the glasses are designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful only during flash photography ( above how retro - reflective materials work on the glasses ) the infrared lights , placed around the eyes and nose areas of the glasses , breaks facial detection software			1
however , a drawback is that some cellphone camera sensors have infrared filters that are capable of cutting off any wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum			0
through the use of infrared light and retro - reflective materials , the glasses are designed to protects people 's online identities			1
1 ) infrared led lights : they are completely invisible to human eyes , and are only detectable by cameras which are sensitive to the wavelengths of these lights			2
2 ) retro - reflective materials : they are claimed to help maintain privacy at the moment that the image is actually taken			1
while most surfaces reflect light by diffusing or scattering it in all directions , retro - reflective materials are specially designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful during flash photography			1
above , an illustration for how retro - reflective materials in the glasses work source : @entity7 the retro - reflective materials on the glasses are designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful only during flash photography			1
@entity115 , senior developer at @entity7 's @entity48 , said that they designed the glasses after exploring the increasing risks of privacy in the digital age			2
' with the increasing use of cellphone cameras in public places , the possibility of your picture or video being taken unaware and ending up on the internet is ever growing , ' @entity115 wrote in a company blog post			0
' take @entity131 's @entity130 example , when they pictured random people in objectionable places or situations such as vomiting , being arrested etc. , or filming inside their home fences			0
' in some countries , @entity131 is even allowed to keep the uncensored images for six months			0
' he then asked : ' how much of our visual identity can we protect from unwanted privacy invaders ? ' can we hide ourselves from cameras or interfere with the face - recognition technologies ? ' @entity115 's questions highlights a report that revealed depending on a smartphone 's settings , the device could be using its built - in gps capability to embed the exact location of the user into the file of photos captured on camera , according to @entity155			0
in this process known as geotagging , if the photographs are shared online , criminals can track the user 's movements based on the geotag and also find out where someone lives			0
@entity21 automatically strips out geotags , according to the report			0
as the glasses are only a prototype , @entity7 said not to expect them on the market any time soon while they continue to explore how technology can combat privacy issues			2
surprisingly , @entity171 are not the first of its kind to try and disguise people 's identities			0
earlier this year , @entity177 's dj , @entity176 , debuted a line of reflective clothing that intentionally ruins paparazzi 's highly - coveted photos by deflecting the light from their cameras			2
the collection , launched during @entity188 's @entity187 competition , includes a hooded jacket , an infinity scarf and a blazer that look like everyday pieces , but essentially act as a mirror when hit with bright light , rendering the wearer practically invisible in flash photography			0

invisibility glasses by @entity7 , a software security company , use infrared led light and retro - reflective materials to block a clear facial capture
glasses , which are only a prototype , break facial detection software , such as technology used on @entity21
