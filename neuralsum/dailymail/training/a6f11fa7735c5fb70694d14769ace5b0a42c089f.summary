by @entity0 published : 04:00 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 08:31 est , 19 september 2013 for years it was the pride of @entity3 's automobile industry			0
but hidden beneath @entity6 's @entity5 site lies a greater , even prouder @entity8 secret - and one that helped with the war against @entity11			1
the ‘ @entity22 ’ are the remnants of lord @entity14 ’s secret plans that were hatched to bolster @entity8 military might in the face of @entity18 military aggression in the arms race that led up to the start of the @entity21			1
the @entity38 involved two parts - building nine new factories and extending existing factories - including the @entity5 plant			1
@entity44 - born industrialist and conservative mp , lord @entity14 - also the founder of @entity46 - had already contributed to the war effort in the @entity48 , turning his factories to munitions and engine production			1
he was appointed to lead the @entity38 by the head of the @entity53 , @entity54 , after then prime minister @entity55 vowed in the desperate build - up to @entity21 to rapidly expand @entity8 production of war machines , weaponry and ammunition			2
while the factory at @entity5 was built underground to ensure the increase in war production was well - protected from possible bombing			1
video courtesy of @entity65 at photoaddiction @entity67 plan : the government scheme involved the development of nine different factories and extensions to existing factories - such as the site at @entity5 war effort : at the peak of the scheme in the 1940s , there were 26 shadow factories operating in @entity3 , producing munitions and parts for war vehicles and aircraft mass production : tens of thousands of workers across @entity3 worked in shadow factories during the peak years of the scheme , producing around one aircraft every hour automobiles : most of the factories involved in the scheme , like @entity5 , were car factories redevelopment : since the collapse of @entity99 in 2005 , part of the @entity5 site has been turned to commercial and residential purposes at peak production point in the mid- 1940s , there were 26 shadow factories in operation in @entity3			1
the factories employed tens of thousands of people , including munitions workers and sub-contractors			0
urban explorer @entity109 , 20 , from @entity111 delved into the tunnels to bring back exclusive pictures of @entity3 ’s hidden wartime heritage			2
' in 1936 @entity46 became chairman of a shadow factory scheme set up by the government			2
' at @entity5 , a flight shed was built , which is distinctive for its interior space and impressive roof structure			0
' close by was a new @entity123 which would become known as the @entity124			0
' my pictures show the series of tunnels was also prepared to provide shelter from air raids and a safe place to relocate manufacturing operations in case of heavy bombing			0
' development : the 15 - acre @entity137 site at @entity5 was built as part of a wider government scheme , spearheaded by @entity14 power : coal - fired boilers with an underground cooling apparatus powered the @entity137 , where the engines were made for @entity8 planes cavernous : the tunnels stretch under most of the 15 - acre site and had space for 10,000 workers equipment : urban explorer @entity109 found much of the old machinery and lighting still in place when he photographed the tunnels after the war , the factory returned to producing automobiles and the tunnels were abandoned			1
by the late 1960s , the @entity5 plant was the second largest car plant in the world , employing some 250,000 workers			1
but since the collapse of @entity99 , part of the site was redeveloped for housing and commercial purposes			0
it was bought by the @entity170 in late 2007 into 2008			0
@entity109 explained why he felt it important for @entity3 to better - preserve wartime sites like this			0
“ it ’s a travesty that nothing has been done to preserve any of the history of the @entity5 works , where @entity8 manufacturers such as @entity46 and later @entity99 were based , ” he said			2
defence : @entity178 - who became chairman of the government 's shadow factory scheme in 1936 , is pictured ( right ) visiting the shadow factory site at @entity5 in 1937 engine driver : lord @entity14 ( in foreground ) , an @entity44 - born industrialist , founded the @entity46 - which had already turned its services to the war effort from 1914 to 1917 ' there ’s little to show what was once a huge employer in the area and a key player in the automotive industry			1
' but i try to document what i ’m seeing as i visit these places			0
' i ’m trying to give who ever looks at the photos a good insight into what there is to be seen			0
' lord @entity14 died in may 1941 , four years before the @entity202 forces finally defeated @entity11 in @entity203 thanks in part to his effort			2
monarch of the skies : @entity209 with @entity210 in 1938 , as he is shown a @entity34			0
many of the planes owed their engines to the shadow factories ... and now : @entity216 vehicles on an assembly line at the now @entity219 owned @entity216 factory in @entity5 , @entity6 in 2011 women of @entity3 : hundreds of female workers were employed at the @entity5 shadow tunnels during the war when many men were sent to fight @entity226 work : even the warning signs , clocks and sinks are still in tact in the tunnels that made up the shadow factory what lies beneath : the factory continued operating on the surface too , with more production going on below business as usual : at the end of the war , the @entity5 plant went back to producing automobiles - like the iconic @entity242 shown here in 1948			1

urban explorer photographs underground factory tunnels beneath @entity6 's @entity5 plant
' @entity38 ' developed in @entity249 years to *compete* with @entity18 arms production
in peak war years underground factory employed around 10,000 workers - many of them women
scheme run by @entity14 - founder of @entity46 - who died before war ended in 1941
factory above ground continues to produce cars under new @entity219 management
