two newspaper staffers have been fired after attributing a false quote to a local sheriff			1
in a piece that ran in @entity4 , @entity6 sheriff @entity5 is said to have told a reporter that most police ' have a desire to shoot minorities			1
' sheriff @entity5 immediately went public saying that he would never make such a comment and was ' pranked , ' and an internal investigation revealed that two members of the staff added the line to the story while it was being fact checked			1
it is believed one added the line as a joke , and the second failed to notice the line had been added while proofreading , and the story went to print with the mistake			2
' i 've had many calls , emails , @entity46 messages , supporting me from people that know i would n't have made such a comment , ' @entity5 told @entity50			0
the paper 's editor , @entity51 , posted a column about the incident on thursday			0
' no reasonable excuse exists for the horrible mistake that occurred thursday in @entity4 , ' he wrote			0
' a retraction and apology has been printed friday on @entity59			0
as community members and neighbors , we feel it is important to repeat this apology again publicly to sheriff @entity5 , the entire law enforcement community and to you , our readers			1
' all good : reporter @entity37 ( above ) did not have anything to do with the change in the story he then revealed , ' many of thursday 's upset callers asked the same question : “ does n't anyone proof your newspaper ? ” ' ' well , surprisingly that 's where the error took place			2
a function and process designed to rid the news pages of error instead added a terrible one that altered the reporter 's original sentence			0
no reasonable excuse can exist			0
' sheriff @entity5 says he does not plan on taking legal action , and the names of the fired staffers have not been released at this time .			1
