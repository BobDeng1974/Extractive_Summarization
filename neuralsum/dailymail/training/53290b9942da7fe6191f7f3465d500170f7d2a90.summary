by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 15:58 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 10:03 est , 6 february 2013 off the hook : a lawyer overseeing the federal investigation into @entity7 says there are no plans to charge him over the doping scandal @entity7 will not be paying back the the millions he collected in bonuses during three of his seven @entity13 victories			1
it 's the latest outrage since the shamed cyclist admitted using performance - enhancing drugs and doping in his career			2
@entity7 's lawyer told @entity19 that his client has no intention of repaying @entity23 - based @entity22 , which paid and insured the $ 12million he was awarded in bonuses during three of his seven @entity13 wins			1
those victories came in 2002 , 2003 and 2004 - all races in which @entity7 admitted that he cheated to win			1
the dispute may now end up in court , as the company says it will file a lawsuit to get the funds back			0
but the @entity7 camp insists that the money is his , and it 's non-refundable			1
mr @entity36 told @entity19 : ' my only point is no athlete ever , to my understanding , has ever gone back and paid back his compensation			0
not [ @entity43 coach ] @entity44 or anybody else			0
@entity44 was banned from the @entity46 for the entire 2012 - 2013 football season for his role in pushing a ' crush - for - cash ' bounty program on the team			0
@entity36 added : ' they were suspended , but nobody said you 've got to give your paycheck back			0
' should @entity7 be charged for perjury after admitting to @entity55 that he had doped ? meanwhile , it has been revealed that @entity7 is the subject of an active criminal investigation by federal investigators			1
the @entity61 champion is potentially facing charges of obstruction , witness tampering and intimidation relating to the systematic cover - up of his drug - taking when he was competing			0
the revelation runs contrary to statements made today by the @entity72 attorney for @entity73 , @entity74 , who spent nearly two years on a criminal investigation of @entity7 , 41 , only to suddenly drop it this time last year			1
a little help : @entity7 celebrates after winning the 15th stage of the @entity13 in 2003 - one of the years that he admitted to cheating sources told @entity82 that agents had recommended an indictment for the drug - cheat on charges of drug distribution , fraud and conspiracy and were stunned when the case was suddenly dropped			1
last night , a high level source told the network : ' @entity74 does not speak for the federal government as a whole			0
' according to the same source who spoke on the condition of anonymity , ' agents are actively investigating @entity7 for obstruction , witness tampering and intimidation			2
' an email to an attorney for @entity7 was not immediately returned to @entity82			2
the statement made earlier today by @entity74 , the @entity72 attorney based in @entity105 , follows @entity7 's confession in a blockbuster interview last month			1
' we made a decision on that case a little over a year ago			0
obviously , we 've been well aware of the statements that have been made by mr @entity7 in other media reports			2
shamed : @entity7 told @entity55 that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport ' that does not change my view at this time , ' @entity74 said at a news conference in @entity120 to announce an unrelated lawsuit against @entity122 's			1
the government will continue to look at the case , @entity74 added , but @entity7 's admission ' has n't changed our view as i stand here today			2
' in february 2012 , @entity74 said his office had closed its investigation into possible crimes by @entity7			2
@entity74 's comments come amid a firestorm of backlash against the disgraced cyclist with his actions since his doping admission			0
on tuesday , @entity7 tied with former @entity137 linebacker @entity136 in atop a @entity139 poll ranking @entity72 's most disliked athletes			1
speculation about charges began anew after @entity7 reversed his past doping denials in an interview with @entity145			0
confession : @entity7 admitted to @entity55 that his seven @entity13 titles were won with the help of performance - enhancing drugs , but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback he told @entity55 he used performance - enhancing drugs and doping in cycling tournaments			1
legal experts said @entity7 exposed himself to possible charges of perjury or obstruction of justice			0
separately , @entity7 faces a civil whistleblower lawsuit filed by former teammate @entity160 , accusing @entity7 of fraud			0
the @entity162 has not said whether it intends to join the suit , and @entity74 did not address the suit at the news conference			0
@entity7 has been banned from cycling for life and stripped of race wins , including seven @entity13 victories			1
@entity36 did not immediately respond to a request for comment on tuesday			0
opponent : @entity7 has a continuing feud with @entity175 ceo @entity174 , who spearheaded a probe into doping on @entity7 's @entity179 teams @entity7 's lawyers said last month that he will talk more about drug use in the sport , just likely not to the @entity175 that led the effort to strip him of his @entity13 titles			1
the question is : when ? in a testy exchange of letters and statements revealing the gulf between the two sides , @entity175 urged @entity7 to testify under oath to help ' clean up cycling			0
' @entity7 's attorneys responded that the cyclist would rather take his information where it could do more good - namely to cycling 's governing body and @entity200 officials			2
@entity175 's response to that : ' the time for excuses is over			0
' the letters underscore the continuing feud between @entity7 and @entity175 ceo @entity174 , the man who spearheaded the investigation that uncovered a complex doping scheme on @entity7 's @entity179 teams			2
@entity7 was stripped of his seven @entity13 victories last year and he has been banned for life from the sport			1
in the @entity55 interview , @entity7 said he owed a long list of apologies and that he would like to see his lifetime ban reduced so he can compete again			1
his most realistic avenue toward that might be telling @entity175 everything he knows in a series of interviews the agency wants started no later than today			0
seventh heaven : @entity7 will talk more about drug use in the sport , just likely not to the @entity175 that led the effort to strip him of his @entity13 titles			1
