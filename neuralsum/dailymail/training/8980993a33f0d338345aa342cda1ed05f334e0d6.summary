by @entity0 published : 16:23 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 17:11 est , 7 november 2013 behind bars : @entity1 , 44 , has been sentenced to spend 11 years in jail for prescribing prescription pain medicine too freely a doctor who treated his patients at a @entity6 has told how he felt what he was doing was fine because plenty of other professionals meet their clients at the coffee chain			1
dr @entity1 has been sentenced to spend 11 years behind bars for prescribing controlled substances without legitimate medical purpose after undercover agents caught him in the act			1
the 44 - year - old opened up to @entity19 's @entity18 , saying how he did n't see anything wrong with using a @entity6 as a meeting place while he saved money for the funds to buy his own practice			0
' there are plenty of lawyers and … other professionals that meet and do business there , and they do n't pay rent either , ' he told @entity19			0
that was n't the only problem with @entity36 's method , however , as he also became the subject of a @entity39 investigation when they found out he being very lax in his prescriptions			1
he was handing out prescriptions for powerful painkillers like @entity44 and anxiety medication @entity45 to patients without doing thorough work ups - and even giving them to people who said that they were picking up the prescriptions for friends who could n't make it to their appointment			2
a third of the prescriptions @entity1 wrote were for people age 25 and younger , prosecutors alleged			2
more than a habit : @entity1 was the subject of an eight - month undercover investigation by the @entity39 who taped conversations of him giving prescriptions to an officer who claimed to be a recovering heroin addict pharmacists in the area said in interviews that they refused to honour @entity1 's prescriptions because ' they considered them outside the scope of a professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose ' , wrote @entity39 agent @entity73			1
dateline tells how an eight - month undercover @entity39 investigation was launched , and agents were served by @entity1 during evening @entity6 clinics across the county			1
investigators traced the sale of painkillers to people in @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
one of the most damning instances came when an agent who was posing as a patient told the doctor that he was a former heroin addict who borrowed painkillers from a friend			2
@entity1 told him : ' you wo n't be having to bum off your friends anymore			2
' while he admitted that it was wrong of him to give a prescription to a ' friend ' of the patient , he felt that his dealing with the ' former addict ' was appropriate			0
family : dr @entity1 , with attorney @entity102 , who appears to be his wife from pictures on @entity105 , had a client base that was mostly younger than 30 - years - old ' there are some people that , if they 're not able to get access to their … pain meds that they ... result to other ways of treating it , and sometimes it 's heroin , so that 's one way i rationalized it , ' he told @entity19			1
some of the actual patients who dealt with @entity1 died while they were receiving his prescriptions , including @entity120			0
@entity19 notes that @entity1 was not charged in @entity120 ' death , but his mother places some of the blame on the doctor			0
@entity1 plead guilty to seven of the 56 counts against him and has now been sentenced to 11 years in jail .			0
