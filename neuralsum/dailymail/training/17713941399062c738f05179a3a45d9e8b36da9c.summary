a chilled glass of @entity1 or @entity2 may look white , but has more in common with red wine than you might imagine			1
scientists have discovered that white grapes contain the same pigments that give red wine its colour , suggesting that ‘ white ’ wine may not really exist			1
the presence of the pigments , called anthocyanins could explain why producers of white wine using white grapes are sometimes surprised to see a pinkish tinge in bottles			1
scientists have discovered that white grapes contain the same pigments that give red wine its colour			1
called anthocyanins , they may explain why producers of wine using white grapes are sometimes surprised to see a pinkish tinge in bottles anthocyanins originate from the skins of grapes and combined with other chemical compounds , are responsible for the majority of red wine ’s colour			1
the precise colour of red wine is dependent on the acidity surrounding anthocyanins in wine and in alkaline solutions , they give a blue colour			1
until now , most wine experts believed that white grapes did n’t have anthocyanins in them , explaining why white wine is almost clear , @entity38 of @entity40 's @entity39 told @entity41			1
anthocyanins originate from the skins of grapes ( @entity2 are pictured ) and combined with other chemical compounds , are responsible for the majority of red wine ’s colour if global temperatures continue to rise , the taste of wine could either drastically change , or the drink could be off the menu completely			1
a wine expert has warned that wines such as @entity53 , are having their flavour significantly altered due to climate change			0
and , as a result , vineyard owners are ditching these grape varieties in favour of those that are better equipped to handle the increases in global temperature			0
the effects are said to be most prominent in @entity64 , @entity40 and @entity65 - although parts of @entity67 , including @entity68 , would also be affected			0
the primary reason is that the grapes are growing faster than before due to increased temperatures - an effect more prominent for wines such as @entity53			0
this is making it hard for vineyard owners to know when to pick the grapes at the right time to maintain a wine ’s particular taste			0
in her study , wine industry consultant @entity80 , associate professor of sustainability science at @entity81 in @entity82 , wrote : ‘ climate change is beginning to affect the singular flavours that people expect from different wines - the experience you come to know and trust from your favourite reds and whites			0
’ she continued : ‘ as the atmosphere warms , the desired ratio of acid to sugar occurs earlier in the season			0
’ ‘ the optimal flavour moment may occur earlier too - but not as much - leaving a gap between the ideal sugar - to - acid ratio and the ideal flavour			0
’ she also said that grapes lack colour when they ripen faster			0
but using mass spectrometry to analyse @entity2 , @entity107 and @entity109 grapes , which are used to make white wine , his team discovered that these grapes so in fact contain anthocyanins			1
the concentrations of anthocyanins found in white grapes are several thousand times smaller than in red grape varieties such as @entity118 , according to the study , published in @entity120			2
mr @entity38 believes that the discovery may explain the long - standing mystery of why wine producers sometimes end up with white wine that looks pink like rosé			1
anthocyanins are known to give blackberries and raspberries their colour , as well as autumn leaves , according to @entity132 - based @entity131 , who writes the blog @entity133 , he explained that red wine is a complex mixture of between 800 and 1,000 chemical compounds			2
compounds called tannins and phenolics make up just 0.1 per cent of a bottles of red wine , but have the biggest impact on its colour and flavour			2
' as wines age , molecules of anthocyanins can undergo a wide variety of reactions to form larger " complexes " , which can also contribute to the red colouration of the wine , ' mr @entity131 explained			2
' as a result , although the concentration of anthocyanins in a bottle of wine will constantly decrease ... the red colour will still remain			2
' tannins - small molecules joined together to make a long chain - dictate a wine 's ' dryness ' and bitterness , reacting with the proteins of a drinker 's saliva to create the sensation of dryness			0
they can also contribute to the colour by combining with the anthocyanins			0
anthocyanins , which were previously only thought to be found in red grapes , are known to give blackberries and raspberries their colour , as well as autumn leaves ( pictured )			2

experts at @entity40 's @entity39 used mass spectrometry to analyse to analyse @entity2 , @entity107 and @entity109 grapes
found white grapes contain anthocyanins , which give red wine its colour
presence of pigments may explain why white wine producers sometimes create *accidental* pink bottles of wine
