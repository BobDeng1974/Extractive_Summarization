by @entity0 eastern promise : despite her @entity4 roots , @entity2 lead the @entity6 @entity5 when @entity11 star @entity10 married @entity12 last year , only their four - year - old daughter @entity7 and two neighbours were in attendance at the ceremony in north @entity15			1
none of his friends , family or children from his first marriage - and none of his famous colleagues from the @entity11 troupe , which has just publicly announced its reunion amid smiles and hugs			2
@entity10 revealed this week that the secret wedding took place just months after the finalisation of his divorce from @entity31 , his wife of 42 years			1
@entity10 claimed he and @entity31 were in an open marriage when he met @entity2 at a book signing in @entity34 in 2005 , where - as a 23 - year - old - she was doing a degree in modern languages			1
but it did n't take long for @entity10 's marriage to hit the buffers			1
apart from the facts that @entity10 reveals - he told @entity42 about the secret wedding , for example , and the fact that the day was not celebrated by fellow @entity46 @entity45 , @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49 - very little is known about his young bride			1
it sounds like the sort of eclectic description that @entity10 himself would write for one of his sketches			1
his wife was born in @entity58 , studied at @entity34 , and enjoys a spot of belly dancing			2
famously , @entity12 was photographed with a belly - dancing troupe at the @entity62 in @entity34 a year after the couple met			1
she was reported to have joined the @entity6 @entity5 because @entity10 likes to role play and wanted to spice up their love life			1
the brunette arrived from @entity67 in 2002 to study modern languages at @entity34 's @entity69 , where @entity10 also gained his degree before embarking on his comedy career			1
@entity10 was doing a book signing when he met @entity2 in 2005 and the pair began dating			1
described as ' quiet and unassuming ' , she is , at first glance , not a traditional siren and was apparently something of a reticent figure at college			2
@entity10 was taking part in a book signing when he met @entity2 , then 23 , in 2005 and the pair began dating			1
they married in secret last year @entity10 and @entity12 with their daughter @entity7 , who was born in 2009 one contemporary told the @entity85 in 2005 : ' if anything , she fancies herself as something of an intellectual and keeps herself to herself			1
she is not an obvious sex symbol			2
’ she was said to be an ' avid fan ' of @entity11			0
on hearing that @entity10 was to attend a book signing at the @entity34 bookshop @entity92 she decided to go along			1
according to one source , she introduced herself to @entity10 and they enjoyed an impromptu chat which continued over drinks and dinner			1
first wife : @entity10 with @entity31 at @entity15 's @entity100 in 1998			1
they were married in 1970 and rem , ained married even after @entity10 fathered @entity12 's child funny friends : @entity47 and @entity45 with @entity10 , centre , and @entity49 and @entity48 at the @entity11 40th anniversary in 2009			1
the reunion shows will start next year in 1995 @entity10 , from @entity109 , @entity110 , had revealed he had an open marriage with @entity31 wife @entity31 , claiming they both had lovers without it affecting their relationship			1
@entity31 was said to be furious over the admission , believing their private life should remain exactly that			1
when she learned of the affair with @entity2 , who is a decade younger than @entity10 's own daughter - one of two children he fathered with @entity31 - she asked @entity10 to leave the marital home in @entity124 , south @entity15			1
he spent @entity125 with @entity12 in the home they now share in @entity127 , north @entity15			1
the couple have been together ever since			0
@entity2 ’s father @entity129 , 55 , a surgeon , supports the relationship			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve never been against it in any sort of way			0
@entity2 , seen smiling for the camera on a family holiday , came to @entity136 in 2002 to study at @entity34 @entity2 at age 22 , a year before she met @entity10 , who is older than her own father @entity2 's difficult pregnancy with @entity7 encouraged her to start knitting ‘ i ’m very fond of @entity10			1
i ’ve been a @entity11 fan since i was a kid			0
i have no opinion on the age difference			0
relationships are not about that			0
’ in 2009 , @entity2 gave birth to the couple ’s only child , daughter @entity7			2
while pregnant @entity2 took up knitting , enjoying it so much that she started a business selling handmade luxury scarfs , blankets and hats			2
the company , named after @entity2 , operates out of a north @entity15 studio and uses high - quality @entity156 wool , as well as alpaca and cashmere			2
talking to the @entity161 newspaper about her venture , @entity2 , who had been working as a script supervisor for @entity10 before she fell pregnant , said : ‘ i was very ill during my pregnancy and had terrible morning sickness			1
‘ i was debilitated really			0
i could n’t even read it was that bad			0
‘ one day my mother gave me some knitting needles to help pass the time			2
i discovered i could do it and spent the whole pregnancy knitting			0
‘ we [ she and @entity10 ] were living and working together at that time , which was actually not bad at all – it was a great collaboration			1
but i always thought i wanted to do something for myself , rather than just play a supporting role for my husband			0

speaking on the @entity211 on sunday , @entity45 said : ' if we can add some shows we will but it will entirely depend on if the tickets sell			0
we always say that when we get together , we laugh more than at any other time in our lives so it 's kind of fun			2
' their last major live show was at the @entity222 in 1982			0
@entity45 added : ' we have to be very careful about doing new stuff			0
it 's not a theatrical presentation , it 's like a rock concert and when people go to rock concerts they want to hear the old songs and they 're actually literally disappointed if you do new material			0
' we 're back : at a press conference last week at the @entity235 , the group posed with @entity236 old material : @entity238 being held up by the @entity46 in their heyday - including the @entity240 , who is just peeking out behind the left of @entity238 's hat the @entity46 amassed millions of fans for their groundbreaking , anarchic comedy series and films , which also launched their own successful solo careers			0
