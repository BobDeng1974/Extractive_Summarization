by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 5 june 2012 updated : 07:05 est , 5 june 2012 when martial arts teacher @entity2 discovered one of the children in her class had @entity8 ’s syndrome , she set out to discover more about the condition			1
‘ i ’d seen the film @entity12 , but that was the extent of my knowledge about autism , ’ says @entity2 , 44 , who lives in @entity10 , @entity11			1
‘ so i bought a book about @entity8 ’s to read up about it			1
’ autism is a developmental disability causing difficulties with communication and relating to other people			2
undiagnosed : teacher @entity2 was surprised to recognise some of the traits of @entity8 's in her husband , @entity24 @entity8 ’s is a ‘ high - functioning ’ form of the condition , where sufferers often have very high iqs			1
learning about its classic characteristics — social awkwardness , a love of detail and repetition , and a tendency for obsessions and collecting — @entity2 was surprised to recognise some of the traits in her husband , @entity24 , 50			0
@entity24 , who is the founder of @entity39 , a string of martial arts academies in @entity11 , owns hundreds of salt shakers he has been collecting since he was ten , which sit in neat rows in their house			0
he is also obsessed with castles and runs an online tearoom review site			0
@entity2 grew more interested , and signed up for a postgraduate certificate in @entity8 ’s			1
that was when the lightbulb moment came			0
recognisable traits : the film @entity12 , pictured , was the extent of @entity2 's knowledge about autism - until she realised her husband had it ‘ one of my tutors said people with autism and @entity8 ’s often have sensitivity to light , touch , colour or taste , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ @entity24 hates clothes against his skin and would strip off to his t - shirt and underwear the minute he got home , even in winter			2
he hates the colour red and bright lights			0
i ’d always called them @entity74			0
now i realised they were signs of @entity8 ’s			1
’ @entity24 was sceptical , but after two years of persuasion , he saw a psychologist and after a three - hour interview he was diagnosed with mild @entity8 ’s			1
but , incredibly , there was more to come			0
though @entity8 ’s is significantly more common in men than women , as @entity2 sat in on @entity24 ’s interview she felt pangs of recognition			1
‘ it was like a checklist of my own past , ’ she says			2
‘ like @entity24 , i love detail , order and lists			2
‘ i was in the top group for most subjects at school , but i did n’t understand fashion or dolls or boyfriends , so was often left in the corner with my book			0
i did n’t have any friends			0
’ in the two years after @entity24 ’s diagnosis , several people on the postgraduate course asked @entity2 if she thought she , too , might have @entity8 ’s			1
sure enough , in october 2010 , she had a day - long interview with psychologists and was also found to have the condition			0
‘ i left the interview and burst into tears , ’ she says			2
‘ i went from feeling upset to angry to confused and sat there crying my eyes out			0
’ big issue : there is a lack of understanding among gps in spotting autism , meaning a third of adults with undiagnosed autism go on to develop severe mental health problems ( file picture ) according to the @entity122 ( @entity123 ) , one in 100 adults has a form of autism			1
there are 225,000 adults living with @entity8 ’s , most of whom do n’t know they have it because they can get by in mainstream life and hold down jobs			1
while autism was first described by psychologist @entity135 50 years ago , @entity8 ’s was n’t recognised in @entity136 until 1994			1
as a result , psychologists suspect the vast majority of undiagnosed adult autism cases will be those with @entity8 ’s who grew up before the disorder was identified			1
‘ by now , we are getting the diagnosis of severe autism right , ’ says dr @entity143 , consultant psychiatrist at the @entity144			1
‘ but adults with @entity8 ’s are slipping through the net because their symptoms are subtle and they may get by on their intelligence			1
that does n’t mean they ’re not secretly going through hell			0
’ the consequences of having @entity8 ’s and not knowing it can be severe			1
‘ people can develop depression and panic attacks or what psychologists call meltdowns			0
that ’s where those with @entity8 ’s use so much energy to act normally that they end up exhausted and unable to get out of bed for days			1
even a small change in plans can shake them			0
’ a recent report by the @entity170 found eight out of ten doctors admitted they did n’t have enough knowledge or training in autism			2
‘ there is a lack of understanding among gps in spotting autism , ’ says @entity175 , head of policy at the @entity123			1
‘ as a result , a third of adults with undiagnosed autism go on to develop severe mental health problems			2
’ indeed , when @entity2 persuaded @entity24 to see his gp he was met with dismissal			0
‘ he said to @entity190 : “ why do you want to know ? you ’re successful , married , what ’s the point ? ” he did n’t believe adults with autism even existed , ’ she says			1
but @entity24 ’s diagnosis was a great relief , not least because it explained his sudden , unexplained rages that had plagued their relationship since the couple met and fell in love 21 years ago			0
of the 500,000 adults with @entity204 , of which @entity8 ’s is a part , 80 per cent are men			1
as is common with many of them , @entity24 ’s condition manifested itself as an anger problem			0
‘ @entity24 would lose his temper for the strangest reasons , ’ says @entity2			2
‘ he never hurt me , but his language was hurtful and we had plenty of broken furniture and holes in the walls			0
‘ in the first few months there were moments when i thought about walking out			0
‘ @entity24 ’s family have a history of mental illness and i wondered at first if perhaps he suffered from bipolar disorder			2
but we were so connected from the very beginning that i could n’t seriously think about being without him			0
‘ eventually , we worked out his triggers — tiredness , hunger and stress , ’ says @entity2			2
‘ we arranged our lives so the triggers did n’t happen			0
the house was always impeccably organised and i stopped wearing red			0
’ because @entity8 ’s in adults is largely undiagnosed , many people may be married to someone with the condition and be unaware of it , suffering rows that could have been avoided with a diagnosis , says dr @entity143			1
‘ people with @entity8 ’s struggle with emotional displays , so their partners often interpret their behaviour as uncaring and undemonstrative			1
they may find it important to stick to plans and timetables , often becoming upset when their partners want to do something spontaneous			0
’ in women , @entity8 ’s symptoms can manifest as extreme passivity or anxiety , says dr @entity255 , consultant psychologist and director of the @entity257 in @entity11			1
@entity2 had always been the calm one in the marriage			0
‘ i did n’t have @entity24 ’s temper , but suffered from nervous anxiety instead , ’ she says			2
‘ women are much better at masking their symptoms , so @entity8 ’s can be misinterpreted as @entity263 , shyness , anxiety or even an eating disorder because sufferers may develop obsessions with calorie counting or exercise			1
’ while it may seem a coincidence that @entity2 and @entity24 both have the condition , @entity272 of charity @entity273 says : ‘ people with @entity8 ’s have been known to enter relationships with each another			1
‘ this may be because the lack of social interaction and cues between them make for a mutual understanding , but there is no scientific evidence proving a link			0
’ there is no medication or treatment for autism or @entity8 ’s , but those diagnosed benefit from care , support and therapy such as @entity293 ( @entity293 ) to help everyday functioning and training in social skills			1
for @entity2 , @entity24 ’s diagnosis had a positive impact on her life			0
‘ i no longer feel to blame for @entity24 ’s rages and feel in control of what is going on , ’ she says			2
‘ i realised it was n’t that i had a rotten temper , but the @entity8 ’s was affecting my behaviour , ’ he says			1
‘ i have learned to control it and when i feel a meltdown or rage coming , i have time alone or listen to music to calm down			0
’ @entity2 specialises in teaching martial arts to children with autism			2
‘ being diagnosed has helped my teaching , ’ she says			2
‘ i can identify with what the children are going through and parents are more willing to open up to me and accept my advice			0
’ she has learned to love the fact she and her husband are just a little different			0
‘ neither @entity24 nor i would want to take drugs or treatments to change the fact we have @entity8 ’s , even if they existed , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ knowing we have it has made our relationship stronger and we would n’t change that			0
