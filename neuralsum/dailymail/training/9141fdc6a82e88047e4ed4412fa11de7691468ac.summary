@entity0 said @entity2 's immigration system had entered ' intensive care ' a backlog of more than 390,000 immigration cases has been built up by the @entity6 – equivalent to the population of @entity8			1
the figure is revealed in a report from mps that describes @entity2 ’s immigration system as being in ‘ intensive care ’			1
earlier this week , chief inspector of immigration @entity14 said that the number of missing migrants in the @entity2 was 89,000			0
but the @entity18 said there were a further 304,222 files piled up elsewhere in the system – including asylum seekers and foreign criminals			0
chairman @entity0 said : ‘ this brings the total number of unresolved immigration cases to 393,222 , which is more than the population of @entity8			1
’ the revelation comes as separate figures show a record 3,000 immigrants a month being caught trying to sneak into the country illegally			1
the @entity6 disclosed that 11,920 entry attempts were detected at @entity34 and @entity2 ports in april to july of this year alone – equivalent to almost 100 a day			2
and last night it emerged that rather than deporting the stowaways back to their home countries , @entity35 is simply releasing them to make new attempts at breaching @entity2 ’s borders			2
on the backlog , @entity42 mp mr @entity0 added : ‘ our immigration system has left @entity46 and has entered intensive care			1
’ in its latest report on the work of the @entity6 ’s immigration directorates , the committee also hit out at the government ’s use of a single immigration target to reduce net migration to less than 100,000			1
the target – which the government now has no chance of achieving , with net migration running at 260,000 – is labelled ‘ too blunt ’ and ‘ arbitrary ’			0
’ the mps also hit out at the @entity6 and @entity77 for sitting on mr @entity14 ’s reports			2
a string of explosive investigations by the inspector have been delayed for months			0
ministers have been accused of slipping them out on busy days in order to try to bury bad news			0
the committee said : ‘ it is unacceptable for the @entity6 to withhold from public view reports produced by the independent chief inspector of immigration and borders for longer than one month without providing a good reason			2
’ the @entity6 was facing accusations of pandering to political correctness after saying foreigners sneaking into @entity2 should not be referred to as illegal immigrants			1
instead they should be called ‘ clandestine entrants ’			0
the term emerged after borders chief @entity14 described them as ‘ irregular migrants ’ in an interview on @entity103 ’s today programme			0
referring to inspection reports on the immigration system , he said : ‘ these people … very often succeed in getting into the @entity2 as irregular migrants , the authorities in @entity2 have no record of who they are			1
’ the @entity6 later said the preferred term was ‘ clandestine entrants ’			2
a spokesman said : ‘ if you say “ illegal immigrants ” there is a presumption and connotations that they have done something wrong			0
there are other reasons people come to this country by illegal methods , for instance because they are trafficked or organised crime groups			0
