by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:49 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 13:58 est , 29 october 2012 a ban on the import of ash trees was today imposed in a bid to tackle the spread of a ' devasting disease ' which threatens to wipe out 80million @entity9 trees			1
the ban will prevent ash plants , trees and seeds coming into the @entity14 , and movement restrictions will stop trees from areas infected with @entity19 ash dieback being moved elsewhere in the country			1
it comes after 100,000 trees thought to be carrying the fungal infection were felled and burned and the scientist in charge of tackling its spread warned it would ' change the countryside significantly			1
' forest favourite : one of @entity14 's 80 million ash trees , which could soon be wiped out announcing the ban , environment secretary @entity32 said : ' this is a very serious disease that demands action to stop its spread			1
' work was already under way to tackle the disease , he added , including monitoring of trees in infected areas to ensure early detection and trade bodies had encouraged members to observe a voluntary moratorium on imports			1
the ban , which follows an eight - week consultation which showed strong support for such a move , is being put in place before the main tree planting season gets under way in mid november			1
' by working together we can protect our native trees from this devastating disease , ' mr @entity32 said			2
unions at the @entity60 last year warned mps that cuts would leave damage their chances of fighting tree diseases			2
in a submission to the @entity68 ' science and technology committee they warned a 25 per cent budget cut would hit the agency 's ability to detect the spread of disease			2
according to the @entity74 , a leaked staff consultation document from february last year said : ' there is no capacity to deal with costs of disease or other calamity			0
' conservationists welcomed the ban , but warned that the problem facing ash trees was symptomatic of a wider problem and accused the government of failing to prioritise protecting woodlands			1
@entity88 , chief executive of the @entity89 , said : ' @entity90 is only one of numerous tree pests and diseases present in the @entity14			1
' with more than 15 separate pests and diseases listed on the @entity60 website as already present , it is crucial that the wider issue is tackled			0
' professor @entity98 , who is in charge of the government task force set up to deal with the ash dieback crisis , yesterday warned the disease 's appearance in @entity14 is ' a disaster for our ash trees '			1
professor @entity98 , chief scientific adviser at the @entity108 , told the @entity109 his team were considering the kind of emergency measures used to tackle foot and mouth			0
' with plants we do n't have as instant a reaction ... as we do with animal pathogens			0
and maybe we ought to be moving in that direction , ' the @entity74 reported him as saying			0
he added : ' ecologically it is going to change the countryside very significantly			0
parallels have been made with @entity125 elm disease of the 1970s			0
this is not good news for the countryside			0
' fungus : @entity90 can lay undetected for years before killing trees the fungal infection , which ravaged other @entity133 countries before spreading to the @entity14 , kills 90 per cent of the trees it affects			1
desperate measures are being taken to protect @entity14 ’s 80million ash trees , which support wildlife as well as the £ 10billion timber industry			1
experts believe it may already be too late to prevent an environmental catastrophe on the scale of the @entity125 elm disease outbreak that destroyed 25million trees in the @entity146 and @entity147			2
ministers have been criticised for failing to act earlier when the parasite was first detected in a nursery in february			1
it is now feared to have spread to 20 sites			2
@entity153 , @entity154 ’s environment spokesman , said the government – which only opened a consultation on ash dieback with businesses and scientists last month – had been ‘ asleep on the job ’			2
the disease was found at the start of the year in a consignment of 2,000 trees imported from the @entity125 , most of which had already been sold by the time the infection was detected			2
@entity168 crisis : the fungus now poses the greatest threat to @entity9 woodland since the 1970s last week the first cases in mature trees were confirmed in @entity175			2
saplings in @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 have also been affected			0
@entity90 ’s microscopic fungus – chalara fraxinea – infects the leaves , bark and wood of ash trees , causing them to develop black spots and cankers , and then wither and die			1
stop dieback : environment secretary @entity32 is ' ready to go ' on the ban which has been blamed for the introduction of the fungus in @entity14 @entity32 , the environment secretary , said yesterday : ‘ we will be introducing a ban on imports			1
i have already prepared the legislation and we are ready to go			0
’ the movement of saplings around the country will also be strictly controlled			0
a task force of 100 people from the @entity60 and other bodies are now tracing all ash imports into the @entity14 for the past five years – at thousands of sites – in an attempt to trace when the disease first arrived here			1
ash dieback has devastated mainland @entity133 , from where more than a million of @entity14 ’s ash trees have been imported over the past two years			1
it has all but wiped out common ash species in @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215			2
a survey has found 20 ‘ suspicious ’ sites in @entity14 , but they are yet to be confirmed by scientists			1
@entity219 , of the @entity60 , said it was a race against time to detect new cases before the falling of autumn leaves made them very difficult to track			0
there are concerns that the fungus may have been lurking undetected for several years , as it can take this long before it becomes apparent			2
scientists are not certain how it spreads , but they suspect it is carried by rain , wind or insects			0
about 58,000 trees have been burned in @entity180 so far , with a further 40,000 destroyed around the rest of the @entity14			1
the @entity238 said it first raised the issue of ash dieback in 2009 , when it called for import restrictions			2
at that stage the disease was thought to be caused by a fungus already endemic in @entity14 , making a ban ineffective			1
it has since been discovered that the fungus is a new one			0
@entity249 of the @entity238 said it was ‘ hugely disappointing ’ that the government had not acted more quickly			0
national tragedy : @entity253 is a £ 10 billion a year industry threatened by the ash dieback disease crisis ‘ we are looking for @entity108 to provide compensation for growers that have suffered as a result of this , ’ he added			0
@entity262 , of the @entity89 , said : ‘ we feel this has n’t been taken as seriously as it should			0
we should have an emergency summit like we had with foot and mouth disease			0
' this could rip massive holes in our landscape – it kills the tree , so it could easily be as bad as @entity125 elm disease			0
’ dame @entity275 , the outgoing director - general of the @entity276 , warned that an outbreak in the @entity14 could be ‘ horrific ’			1
‘ we ’re just praying that this ash dieback can be understood , and managed , quickly , ’ she said			0
@entity279 , president of the @entity280 , said it was a ‘ great pity ’ that an ash tree ban was not announced earlier in the year to prevent further imports from @entity133 , where the disease is rife			1
mr @entity32 denied that the @entity251 had taken too long to act , saying a ‘ detailed process ’ would be carried out at 1,000 sites to identify where trees had come from			1
environment secretary @entity32 said : ' as soon as the first case was confirmed in february , we immediately began to trace its source , so we could get it under control and minimise the spread of the disease			0
' we immediately arranged for any infected trees to be destroyed			0
' we held urgent talks with the industry about the impact of @entity90 resulting in a voluntary import ban			0
' i announced last week that a ban on the import of ash trees and movement controls within the @entity14 would come into force on monday , well before the planting season begins			1
' i have set up a new plant health task force which will look at further ways to prevents pests and diseases from entering the country in the future			0

government criticised for taking so long to act against killer tree fungus
100,000 trees have been burned and more than 20 ' *highly* suspicious ' sites *highlighted* across @entity319 , @entity320 and @entity321
@entity323 could affect 80million ash trees - around *30* per cent of @entity14 trees
@entity327 on ash tree imports effective from today
