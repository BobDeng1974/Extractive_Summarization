by @entity0 @entity1 showed @entity2 what they may miss at @entity4 with two goals in @entity7 's 2 - 0 win over @entity8 on monday night			1
the striker made his £ 16million move to @entity11 on the transfer deadline day , and the striker has already been labelled as a ' bargain ' after his deadly brace on the international scene			1
here , @entity17 take a look at seven @entity7 players that raised their game when playing for their country			1
@entity23 ( caps : 57 goals : 10 ) the midfielder had success at @entity27 and @entity28 but his best moments all came on the international stage , including his breakthrough displays at @entity32 and that goal against @entity34 at @entity35			1
at his best : @entity23 had success at @entity27 and @entity28 but his best moments came internationally @entity39 ( caps : 49 goals : 24 ) a stalwart for @entity42 but @entity39 ’s career was defined by what happened at the 1966 @entity45 , with four goals , including a hat - trick in the final , securing victory			0
not bad for a third - choice striker ... up : a @entity42 stalwart but sir @entity39 ( right ) defined his career at the 1966 @entity45 with four goals @entity55 ( caps : 62 goals : 7 ) while his goalscoring record was never first - rate , his 11 - year international career — and his partnership with @entity62 during the 5 - 1 win in @entity64 — show his value			0
while @entity55 's goalscoring record was never first - rate , his 11 - year international career show his value @entity68 ( caps : 50 goals : 1 ) consistent without being spectacular , the 28 - year - old midfielder has often struggled to hold down a regular spot for club or country			2
yet his versatility makes him an asset			0
in and out : consistent without being spectacular , the 28 - year - old @entity68 is a versatile option @entity78 ( caps : 56 goals : 10 ) despite winning a lot of silverware at @entity84 , the midfielder ’s best days came in an @entity7 shirt			2
he featured in three @entity86 , including 2006 where he scored a superb goal against @entity89			0
three @entity86 : despite winning a lot of silverware at @entity84 , @entity78 's best days came for @entity7 @entity94 ( caps : 30 goals : 33 ) despite making his debut at 25 , the @entity97 legend went on to become the joint - sixth highest goal scorer in @entity7 history			1
history : @entity97 legend @entity94 went on to become the joint - sixth highest @entity7 scorer @entity103 ( caps : 42 goals : 22 ) some of the goals came against inferior opposition , but @entity107 has the best goals to games ratio by an @entity111 striker in the past 20 years			2
in the @entity112 , he ’s never reached the same heights			0
he 's in the record books ... @entity107 has the best goals to games ratio by an @entity111 striker in the past 20 years			0

@entity1 's @entity7 brace against @entity8 may have showed those at @entity4 what they could be missing out on
