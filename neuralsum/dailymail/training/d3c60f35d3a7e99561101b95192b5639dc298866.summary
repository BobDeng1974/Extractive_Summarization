as the @entity2 spacecraft closes in on @entity3 , new images have emerged showing the solar system 's largest asteroid at 27 pixels across - three times better than the images taken in early december			1
over the next weeks , @entity2 will provide increasingly sharper images of the icy world , leading up to the spacecraft 's capture into orbit around @entity3 on march 6			1
' we know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet @entity3			1
now , @entity2 is ready to change that , ' said @entity18 , @entity2 's chief engineer and mission director , based at @entity21 's @entity20 in @entity22			0
as the @entity2 spacecraft closes in on @entity3 , new images have emerged showing the solar system 's largest asteroid at 27 pixels across - three times better than the images taken in early december			1
this gif shows bright and dark features this most recent images from @entity2 were taken january 13 at a distance of 238,000 miles ( 383,000 km )			1
while these latest images from @entity2 are n’t quite as sharp as @entity30 ’s images from january 2004 , @entity21 says they will be very soon			2
' already , the [ latest ] images hint at first surface structures such as craters , ' said @entity34 , lead investigator for the framing camera team			0
@entity3 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			2
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb ( 6kg ) per second			2
this is a raw image , taken january 13 , 2015			1

it hints at craters on the surface of @entity3			0
@entity2 's framing camera took this image at 238,000 miles ( 383,000km ) from @entity3			1
on the right , is a zoomed - in raw image ' now , finally , we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious , alien world , ' @entity2 mission director and chief engineer @entity18 , of @entity21 's @entity20 in @entity54 , @entity22 said			0
' soon it will reveal myriad secrets @entity3 has held since the dawn of the solar system			0
' observations by the @entity65 's @entity64 suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes			0
@entity3 orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between @entity70 and @entity71 and is very similar to @entity71 's @entity72 and @entity74 's @entity73 - both considered potential sources for harbouring life			1
@entity3 is the bright spot in the centre of the image			0
because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background , the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible			2
the long exposure made @entity3 appear overexposed , and exaggerated its size a cropped , magnified view of @entity3 appears in the inset image at lower left @entity2 will be captured into @entity3 ' orbit in march , marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity3 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			1
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface @entity3 is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			1
@entity3 is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '			1
scientists think @entity3 may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere			0
it lies less than three times as far as @entity114 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
@entity21 's @entity2 has been making its way to @entity3 from the asteroid @entity121 since september 2012			1
it is due to land next year			0
there is high interest in the mission because @entity3 is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice , water , and minerals			0
dr @entity132 , of the @entity65 's lab in @entity134 in @entity135 said : ' although ground and space - based observations may further map the behaviour of @entity3 over its orbit the @entity2 spacecraft mission arriving to orbit @entity3 in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long - term follow - up on the water outgassing behaviour of @entity3			1
' the presence and abundance of water in bodies like @entity3 could have relevance for the origin of life on @entity114 and the large - scale migration of planets such as @entity71			2
one scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early @entity114 and @entity161 - delivering organic molecules and water to @entity114			0
@entity3 is twice the size of @entity74 's geyser - spouting moon @entity164 which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface			2
it lies less than three times as far as @entity114 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
since launching in 2007 , @entity2 has already visited @entity121 , a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles ( 168 million km ) away from @entity3			2
the distance between @entity121 and @entity3 is greater than the distance between the @entity114 and the sun. during its 14 months in orbit around @entity121 , the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights , including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history			1
@entity121 and @entity3 are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt			0
the image was taken as part of a final calibration of the science camera before @entity2 's arrival			0
on december 1 , @entity3 was about nine pixels in diameter - nearly perfect for this calibration			0

the @entity3 asteroid orbits the sun between @entity70 and @entity71 , and may have water gushing from its surface
latest image was taken on january 13 from a distance of 238,000 miles ( 383,000km ) from the dwarf planet
@entity2 is currently *travelling* to meet @entity3 in march where it will *attempt* to understand its geological history
