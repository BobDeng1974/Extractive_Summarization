by @entity0 most women are happy to powder the nose they were born with while a few feel the need to give it a modest cosmetic tweak			2
but @entity6 is so obsessed with ensuring hers remains the height of fashion she has given it a new look three times			0
now she proudly displays what is currently the most sought - after in the industry - a @entity16 / @entity15 hybrid			1
@entity6 , 58 , pictured now , after her third ' @entity15 / @entity16 ' nose job , ( l ) and at 22 , before any surgery ( r ) to create her perfect nose , @entity20 , 58 , travelled to @entity21 where , she says , talented surgeons operate for lower fees			1
she took pictures of @entity16 and @entity15 's noses and ' photoshopped ' versions of her own nose ' erasing the bridge and lifting the tip ' to show the surgeon the desired outcome			1
after having the procedure last month , @entity20 has now finally announced : ' this will be my last nose job			2
' the bill for her three nose operations amounts to £ 10,000			0
she had her first one when she was 34 , deciding to replace her original nose - ' which she never liked '			0
but it failed to leave her looking ' any different ' so she went under the knife again two years later to get a ' scooped ' nose modelled on @entity45 's			0
her contentment lasted 22 years until @entity20 decided it was ' too @entity47 ' and began planning something more ' elegant ' and ' timeless '			0
@entity20 aged 35 after one nose job ( l ) and after her second surgery , aged 58 , just before getting her new nose ( r ) @entity20 , who is a cosmetic surgery adviser , says she is not alone in wanting a nose like @entity16 or @entity15			1
' i do have clients that repeatedly want @entity16 noses			0
they say i want @entity16 's nose , i want @entity15 's nose , and , i 'm thinking , so do @entity60 ' @entity20 , a farmer 's daughter from @entity61 , said as a young girl she soon realised ' that guys and girls with a certain look had more power '			1
she has now had 57 cosmetic changes - at a total cost of £ 67,000 - including a jaw re-shape , cheek implants , an eye lift and a chin bone reduction			1
in fact , she has recreated every part of her body apart from her feet and arms , but says : ' the arms are next			0
' the @entity16 ( l ) and @entity15 ( r ) have sought - after noses the @entity80 has been campaigning for tougher regulation of the cosmetic industry since last year			1
through the @entity85 campaign , this newspaper has called for measures including a minimum standard for surgeons , proper regulation for those practising cosmetic surgery and an end to hard - sell tactics that see special offers and glossy advertising undermine the seriousness of the procedures involved			2
interviewed after an @entity99 debate last week , held for the @entity100 , @entity20 said : ' there 's a lot of really glossy and seductive information on the internet and people use it			0

@entity6 , 58 , is finally happy after her third *rhinoplasty*
@entity16 / @entity15 hybrid is ' most sought - after nose in industry '
@entity20 's had 57 cosmetic changes - worth £ 67,000 - including jaw re-shape
