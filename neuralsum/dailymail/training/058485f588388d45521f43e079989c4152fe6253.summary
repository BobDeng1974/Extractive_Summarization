by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 07:01 est , 2 may 2013 police are refusing to name suspects they have charged with criminal offences			1
@entity1 announced yesterday that it would not name suspects as it charged one of its own former officers with the theft of £ 113,000 from the force ’s former headquarters			1
a short footnote at the bottom of the press release revealing the charging decision said : ‘ due to a change in policy we no longer release the name of an individual on charge			1
’ @entity1 have refused to name an officer charged with a £ 113k theft from the force 's former headquarters it is a long - standing convention for police to name those they charge with an offence			1
until recently , they would also routinely name anyone they had arrested if asked			2
but following the @entity33 report into press standards , forces have begun rolling back the public ’s right to know who is being arrested			0
to the horror of free speech campaigners , senior officers have drawn up plans which would ban the @entity42 and public being told the identity of anyone arrested			0
however , the refusal to name a suspect who has been charged and may already be in police custody goes a significant step further in wrapping the judicial system in a cloak of secrecy			1
the naming of suspects who have been charged with criminal offences – and who will stand trial in court – is widely seen as an essential bulwark against arbitrary arrest and detention			1
last night critics condemned the @entity1 force ’s decision , branding it an extension of the ‘ secret state ’			1
@entity69 mp @entity68 , an influential member of the @entity71 culture committee , said : ‘ this is completely and utterly unacceptable			0
mp @entity68 said the move by @entity1 was an extension of the ' secret state ' ‘ this kind of secret state that they are trying to encourage goes against all our freedoms and traditions in this country			1
’ ‘ the government really needs to stop this in its tracks before it gets out of control			0
’ freedom of speech campaigners said the decision not to name a former police officer charged with a crime was ‘ extremely worrying ’			1
@entity93 chief executive @entity92 said : ‘ keeping secret the names of people who have been charged with crimes goes against the principle of open justice that we have in this country			1
‘ although there may be instances when it is appropriate not to release a name , this should not be a general policy			0
‘ that the police have decided not to name a former police officer is extremely worrying			2
’ last night the @entity1 force ’s acting deputy chief constable @entity109 defended the policy			1
he denied the new secrecy had anything to do with the fact that it was a former officer who had been charged			1
he said : ‘ the policy was recently changed to align with national policy @entity117 and not because of today ’s outcome			0
’ @entity33 ’s report called for a ban on the press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested			0
the report said : ‘ save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances ( for example , where there may be an immediate risk to the public ) the names or identifying details of those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the @entity42 or public			0
’ lord justice @entity137 s report called for a ban on the press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested in the wake of the report , senior police officers have drawn up guidelines to apply to all forces which would ban them from confirming the names of suspects to journalists			2
in the coming weeks , the @entity151 will publish detailed policy designed to bring the draconian new rules into force			2
the plan is opposed by the @entity156 , the government ’s own adviser on legal reform , which has said it is in the interests of justice that the police name those arrested , except in very exceptional circumstances			0
last month , two senior judges backed the ‘ secret arrests ’ policy			2
lord @entity168 and mr @entity169 said arrest could cause ‘ irremediable damage to the person ’s reputation ’			0
only in exceptional circumstances should details of those arrested or suspected of crime be made known to the public , they said			0
even before the full rules are in use , some forces are already operating under the new @entity182 of the @entity151 plan say it undermines open justice			0
the step taken by @entity1 to not name even those who are charged was unheard of until last night			1
in its press release , the force said the accused man is a 54 - year - old from the @entity191 area			2
it said it would give the individual ’s surname to journalists the day before he appears before @entity197 magistrates on may 22			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
