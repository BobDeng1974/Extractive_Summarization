some museums have to trap treasures behind dusty glass to protect them , which obscures many of the most interesting and intricate details			0
but a new invention could give them a fresh lease of life			0
scientists have developed interactive semi-transparent mirrors that allow people to ‘ touch ’ objects using the reflection of their fingers			1
to create the technology , computer scientists from the @entity36 created a setup that involved sensors , projectors and semi-transparent mirrors placed in front of a pane of glass			1
using the sensors , the viewer 's movements are tracked , while their reflection is mapped on a mirror inside			0

as a finger 's reflection lands on an object inside the glass , the artefact is illuminated and menu options appear using augmentation and the projectors			2
depending on the setup , an information box will pop up to show details about that object , or a @entity72 virtual model will appear in mid-air			2
this model can then be rotated using hand gestures , to explore the artefact from every angle			0
as a finger 's reflection lands on an object inside the glass , the artefact is illuminated and menu options appear using augmentation and the projectors			2
depending on the setup , an information box will pop up to show specific details about that object , or a @entity72 virtual model will appear in mid-air			2
this model can then be rotated using hand gestures , to explore the artefact from every angle			0
the technology could also be used by doctors to project brain scans onto a patient ’s body , and in airports as a new kind of security scanner that would reveal the location of hidden objects by showing their location on a person			1
the researchers have unveiled their study at the @entity107 conference in @entity108 , @entity109			0
they claim their device could change the way people interact in public spaces , such as museums and shops			1
in a museum , people in front of a cabinet would see the reflection of their fingers inside the glass case overlapping the same point behind the glass , allowing them to seemingly reach around objects			1

they could also access extra information and even @entity143 ( pictured ) by pointing at a chosen artefact museums : semi-transparent mirrors could aloow people to ‘ touch ’ exhinbts in museums that are behind glass , with the reflection of their fingers to reveal information and illuminate inaccessible objects hospitals : doctors could project brain scans onto a patient ’s body			1
airports : the technology could be used as a new kind of security scanner that could reveal the location of hidden objects by showing their location on a person			1
shops : people could try on clothes when a shop is closed by using semi-transparent mirrors and an interactive system			1
music studio : musicians can record loops on digital mixers , which appear as floating images above it			0
they could grab the representations to play or edit them using different musical effects			0
museum goers could also interact with exhibits by focusing their eyes on them			1
by combining the mirror with a projector , people ’s fingertips could act like little torches to illuminate the objects they point at			1
when the reflection of someone ’s hand cuts though the object , the projections on visitors ’ hands could also reveal the inside of an object on display			1
they could use their finger as a cursor to rotate a 3d reconstruction of an object too			2
lead researcher dr @entity206 told @entity207 that the technology uses the space behind and in front of the reflective surface to add augmentations			2
' for instance , in the museum cabinet , the top projector allows you to do projection mapping , changing the external aspect of the object			0
' however , it would never be able to reveal its internals			0
using our approach , your hand 's reflection can cut through the @entity227 we project on your hand as it cuts though , this will be visible inside the object			0
' the researchers have also demonstrated how their technology can be used by musicians			0

the computer scientists claim the system could also allow people to try on clothes when a shop is closed by using semi-transparent mirrors and an interactive system			1
‘ this work offers exciting interactive possibilities that could be used in many situations , ’ continued dr @entity206 , a researcher in human - computer interaction			1
by combining the mirror with a projector , people ’s fingertips could act like torches to illuminate the objects they point at			1
when the reflection of someone ’s hand cuts though the object , the projections on visitors ’ hands could also reveal the inside of an object on display , shown using this globe ‘ semi-transparent surfaces are everywhere around us , in every bank and shop window			1
one example is when people ca n’t access a shop because it ’s closed			2
' however , their reflection would be visible inside the shop window and that would enable them to try clothes on using their reflection , pay for the item using a debit / credit card and then have it delivered to their home			2
‘ the possibility to blend together the spaces in front and behind the semi-transparent mirror could mean a whole new type of interactive experience			2
‘ while projectors can only augment the surface of objects , combining them with reflections allows people to reveal what ’s inside the object or even purely virtual objects floating around them			1

semi-transparent mirrors let people ‘ touch ’ objects with finger reflections
these reflections can illuminate and reveal information about artefacts
museum goers could also interact with exhibits simply by looking at them
technology could *additionally* be used by doctors to project brain scans , or by *retailers* in shop windows so people can try on clothes
it was developed by computer scientists at @entity36
