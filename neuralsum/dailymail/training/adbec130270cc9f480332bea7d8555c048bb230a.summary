@entity9 , 22 , and her parents @entity11 , 51 , and @entity12 , 49 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , died in a hail of bullets from three armed gunmen in @entity18 in 2010			1
they had been in @entity2 for the wedding of one son but died because of a bitter dispute over the pending divorce of another , police say			1
however , nobody has ever been brought to justice since two of the suspected killers were arrested - with their mother - but went on the run when they were granted bail			1
gunned down : @entity32 and his @entity33 , who were killed in @entity18 in 2010 as the trio were ambushed by the machine gun - wielding gang , mother - of - two @entity9 was shot in the legs , but managed to run for cover			1
the shooters tracked her down after killing @entity41 and mrs @entity9 and then pulled out a mobile phone and ordered her to speak to her husband before blasting her up to 100 times			1
killed : @entity12 , 49 , was also murdered in the attack believed to have been retribution for the breakdown of the 10 - year arranged marriage of their son @entity49 police believe the slayings were retribution for the breakdown of a 10 - year arranged marriage between one of @entity41 and mrs @entity9 's three sons , @entity49 , and his cousin @entity57			1
days later , @entity57 's mother , @entity59 , and two brothers , @entity61 and @entity62 , were arrested in connection with the crime			1
but the brothers , believed to have been among the gunmen , fled as soon as they were granted bail			1
they have not been seen since			0
the mystery deepened in april this year when @entity9 ’s grandmother , @entity69 , was beaten to death in @entity18 in what police believe was a connected attack			1
now the prime minister has demanded answers from the @entity2 government after two years without any further developments			0
writing to @entity78 , the family 's local mp , mr @entity0 said : ' i can not begin to imagine how difficult this must be for the families of those involved			0
' i fully appreciate that the families will want to see the people responsible for these crimes brought to justice			0
' this is the least that they deserve and i can understand their frustrations with the slow pace of the investigations			0
' he said he dispatched delegates from the @entity96 to step up pressure on the @entity2 authorities over the summer and promised to meet mr @entity78 when @entity99 reassembles in @entity100 to update him on progress			0
' as you are aware the @entity96 ministers have taken an active interest in both cases , and in the wider issue of the safety of @entity5 nationals in @entity2 , ' he added			2
aftermath : @entity2 relatives and residents carry a cot with the body of @entity114 near the town of @entity18 in eastern @entity2 the murders took place in the @entity18 district of north east @entity2 where the @entity32 family had travelled for a wedding of another one of their sons , @entity123 , then 23 , to his fiance , @entity125			1
furniture manufacturer mr @entity32 and his wife and daughter , a former @entity129 worker , had stayed in @entity2 after the wedding to visit friends and relatives while the rest of the family returned to the @entity5			2
they were in the village of @entity136 , paying respects at a relative 's grave site when the raiders struck			0
tough talk : the prime minister has demanded answers from the @entity2 government after two years without any further developments in the hunt to catch the killers @entity148 , a cousin and family spokesman , said after attack : ' [ shooting @entity9 in the legs ] could have been on purpose or they could have just been spraying bullets and got her in the legs			1
' she hid , so they dealt with the parents and then went after her			0
they knew she was somewhere in the graveyard			0
' the conversation between @entity9 and her husband was very minimal			2
he heard her beg for her life and then heard gunfire			0
' her brother @entity123 , 25 , added : ' she begged for her children and said she needed her two little boys [ ... ] and then they just shot her			0
' relatives have claimed mr @entity32 was warned never to set foot in the village , which is home to the family of his son @entity49 ’s estranged wife @entity57			0
when @entity49 and @entity57 , who lived in @entity13 and have two children , split up in 2009 , it triggered the feud which led to her brothers warning mr @entity32 he faced ' grave consequences ' if he ever returned to their home village			2
but mr @entity32 defied the warning after returning to @entity2 with his wife and daughter for the wedding of another of his sons in a village 15 miles away			2
responding to the prime minister 's call to action , mr @entity78 said : ' the government can not go higher than the prime minister personally intervening			0
' hopefully this will bring justice for the @entity194 and @entity69 ’s family closer and also ensure that other @entity5 citizens who suffer tragic losses in @entity2 do not have to go through the same prolonged ordeal			2
' escaped : one of the two suspects captured in the killing stares out from behind bars in a @entity2 jail before being granted bail senseless : covered with a blanket , the body of one of the victims is carried away @entity11 and @entity209 and their daughter @entity9 were killed in a village in the district of @entity18 in north - east @entity2 @entity215 s grandmother , @entity69 , was beaten to death in @entity18 ( pictured ) in what police believe was a connected attack @entity221 councillor @entity220 , a relative of the @entity194 and friend of @entity69 ’s family , said : ' i think it is great that the prime minister has personally intervened in these cases and that they have gone to the very top of government			1
