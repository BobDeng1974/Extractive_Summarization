by @entity0 published : 01:50 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 03:53 est , 6 march 2013 surgically removing deep fat from around the waist could reduce obese women 's risk of bowel cancer , a study suggests			1
obese people with an oversized waistline have a higher chance of developing bowel cancer , but the results of a @entity13 study indicated that the risk was reduced in women who had visceral fat removed from around the waist			1
dieting , which had little effect on visceral or abdominal fat - that which accumulates around the organs - did not remove the risk , the study found			1
' @entity24 ' : the surgical removal of visceral fat from around the waist reduces obese women 's risk of developing intestinal tumours , a study suggests in contrast , calorie restriction had a significant effect on intestinal tumours in men , but removal of visceral fat did not			1
an excess of visceral fat results in individuals developing a protruding abdomen , often described as a ' pot ' or ' beer ' belly			0
obesity has long been closely linked to many cancers			0
the study saw a team from @entity48 in @entity49 set out to examine the role of visceral fat in mice genetically prone to developing colon cancer			1
risk : researchers say they have proved that too much abdominal fat actually causes the disease , rather than the habits that fuel obesity researcher dr @entity59 said : ' there has been some scepticism as to whether obesity per se is a bona fide cancer risk factor , rather than the habits that fuel it , including a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle			1
' although those other lifestyle choices play a role , this study unequivocally demonstrates that visceral adiposity is causally linked to intestinal cancer			1
' the study randomly assigned the mice to one of three groups			0
mice in the first group underwent a sham surgery and were allowed to eat an unrestricted ' buffet style ' diet , for the entirety of the study , which resulted in these mice becoming obese			1
those in the second group were also provided an unrestricted diet and became obese , but they had their visceral fat surgically removed at the outset of the study			0
mice in the third group also underwent a sham surgery , but were provided only 60 per cent of the calories consumed by the other mice in order to reduce their visceral fat by dieting			2
dr @entity59 said : ' our sham - operated obese mice had the most visceral fat , developed the greatest number of intestinal tumours , and had the worst overall survival			0
' however , mice that had less visceral fat , either by surgical removal or a calorie - restricted diet , had a reduction in the number of intestinal tumours			2
this was particularly remarkable in the case of our group where visceral fat was surgically removed , because these mice were still obese , they just had very little abdominal fat			0
' the researchers then subdivided the groups by gender			0
in female mice , the removal of visceral fat was significantly related to a reduction in intestinal tumours , but calorie restriction was not			2
in male mice , calorie restriction had a significant effect on intestinal tumours , but removal of visceral fat did not			0
he added : ' this suggests that there are important gender differences in how adiposity and nutrients interact with the tumour environment			0
in addition , the study emphasizes the need to promote strategies that reduce visceral fat in abdominally obese individuals			2
' the team said more studies were needed to uncover the mechanisms behind the causality between visceral fat and intestinal cancer , to determine how abdominal obesity and nutrient availability act independently during the stages of tumour promotion and progression , and to determine how other strategies to promote weight loss , such as bariatric surgery , affect cancer risk			1
the findings are published in the journal @entity156 .			0

@entity159 did not reduce the bowel cancer risk , the @entity13 study found
in men , calorie reduction did reduce the risk , while surgery did not
