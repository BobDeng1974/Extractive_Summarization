why is the sun ’s corona - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - so much hotter than its surface ? that is one of greatest solar mysteries , but astronomers will be hoping to find an answer on friday - by observing the total solar eclipse from the @entity12			1
the plasma of the sun is only visible during a total eclipse , so the scientists will use this unique opportunity to try and solve the puzzling phenomena			1
and in an amazing coincidence , the eclipse will occur over the @entity12 on the same day the sun comes into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years			1
they will use an array of instruments to look at the sun 's corona			1
this is plasma around the sun that can only be seen during a total eclipse			1
shown is an image of 1999 's solar elcipse from @entity40 , with the corona visible around the edges the team of scientists will be working at an old observatory on @entity27 , midway between continental @entity45 and the @entity12			1
they are travelling to this region to ensure they see totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse			1
for observers in other regions , such as the @entity55 , less than 90 per cent of the sun will be covered			1
the team at @entity27 , led by professor @entity57 , @entity58 at the @entity59 , will include scientists from @entity61 in @entity62			1
they are @entity63 and @entity64 from the @entity65 at the @entity66 at @entity61			0
they will join scientists from the @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 as part of the ' @entity73 '			0
up to 14 specially adapted cameras will be used to photograph the sun in different frequencies during the eclipse , capturing images of the plasma from the corona			1
in so doing , they will hope to solve the sun ’s greatest mystery			2
the temperature of the sun is known to be around 6,000 ° c ( 10,800 ° f ) , but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000 ° @entity88 ) , and even reaches @entity89 ( 3,600,000 ° f ) in some areas			2
this factor of 300 difference would be akin to the flame of a fire being 300 times colder than the air around it - but why this is occurring is unknown			1
one potential reason could be magnetic forces on the sun , with superheated gas creating a strong magnetic field and funnelling energy into the corona , but this has not yet been confirmed			2
the team of scientists will be working at an old observatory on @entity27 , midway between continental @entity45 and the @entity12 ( shown with the red marker )			1
they are travelling to this region to ensure they see totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse astronomer @entity116 from @entity117 do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse ? ' it ’s all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening , but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes , binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight			1
' that ’s not to say that you ca n’t watch the eclipse on friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection			2
' dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk			1
however , unless you already own one , know somebody who does or are looking to get into solar astronomy , they can be a massive investment of several hundred pounds			0
' there are cheaper ways to observe the eclipse , though			2
' are solar glasses fine to use ? ' many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse			2
these can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers			0
' they work by employing a @entity150 film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun ’s light , allowing you to view the eclipse safely			1
' before using them though , you should make sure that they are not damaged in any way and you should ensure that you have bought them from a reputable dealer			0
if you ’re in doubt , do n’t use your viewers at all			0
' how can you use a telescope to observe the eclipse ? ' if you own a telescope , then there are several ways for you to observe the eclipse			2
' if you do n’t own them already , it is possible for you to buy a solar filter , which covers the aperture of your telescope to ensure that you can observe the sun safely			1
' they are found to be made of glass or as with the solar glasses , @entity150 film			0
it is possible to make a solar filter using @entity150 sheets but caution is advised while making your own solar filter - any scratches or pinholes will lead to dangerous amount of sunlight entering your eyes			0
' you should also avoid relying on eyepiece filters - they can not handle the sun ’s light			0
' telescope projection is also a safe way to observe the eclipse			2
by using two large , white pieces of card , you can project the eclipse ’s image onto one piece , while using the other to fit around your telescope ’s tube to act as a mask to shield your eyes from the sun. ' focusing your telescope ’s eyepiece , while holding the second card away , which projects the image , will enable you to show the eclipse to a large group of people safely			0
' you should not use a cheap , plastic telescope for telescope projection and ensure that your finderscope has its cap on			0
' never look at the eclipse whilst lining up your telescope with the sun and never leave your telescope unattended			2
you should also ensure that your instrument does n’t overheat			0
' can you use household items to view the eclipse ? ' if you do n’t have a standard telescope or have forgotten to buy a solar viewer , then there are several household items you can use so that you do n’t miss out on seeing this fantastic event			2
' using a piece of card , or anything that has small holes punched into it , you can project the eclipse onto another piece of card			0
this is certainly one of the safest ways of viewing the eclipse since you do n’t need to look at the sun at all			2
' a washing up bowl or bucket can also be lined with a black bin liner and then filled with water to make a reflective surface to safely watch the eclipse			0
when and where will the eclipse be visible ? ' the eclipse will begin in the morning			0
for observers in the @entity55 , the eclipse starts at 8.30am , peaks at 9.35 am and ends at 10.41am , so you should make sure that you know where the @entity246 rises from your location			1
' the total solar eclipse - that ’s 100 per cent of the @entity246 ’s surface covered by the @entity251 - is visible from the @entity252 and @entity27 but if you are unable to get to these locations , many are able to see a substantial partial eclipse - for instance , @entity255 will see around 90 per cent of the @entity246 ’s disc covered by the moon			1
' how dark will it get in the @entity55 ? ' in @entity261 and even in places where there 's 90 per cent sun coverage , we 're not really going to notice any changes in brightness because there 's still a portion of the sun 's surface uncovered			1
' it 'll be like there 's a cloud passing over the @entity246 - you know it 's cloudy but it 's still light			0
' observations will take place from the @entity278 in @entity27 , pictured			0
in an amazing coincidence , the eclipse will occur over the @entity12 on the same day the sun comes into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years			0
data and images taken during the eclipse will be used to try and develop a mathematical model to understand this difference in temperature			0
' the difference between the temperature of the sun and that of the sun ’s corona is one of the great mysteries of astronomy , ’ said dr @entity297 , a reader at the @entity65 at @entity61 , who is overseeing the team ’s work from the @entity55			1
‘ a total eclipse gives us an unique opportunity to measure the corona of the sun is so much detail and collect data that will enable us to better understand this difference			1
' the temperature of the sun 's surface ( shown ion this @entity313 image ) is known to be around 6,000 ° @entity314 ) , but for some reason the corona is around @entity317 ( 1,800,000 ° f ) , and even reaches @entity318 ( 3,600,000 ° f ) in some areas , a factor of about 300 he also added that studying the corona could help protect satellite - based communication systems from solar storms , which can be affected by coronal mass ejections - huge eruptions of material - from the sun. but he noted that the conditions were ' cold ' - and also potentially dangerous			1
‘ all the team have had to do safety training , including polar bear training , ’ dr @entity297 told @entity329			0
‘ they will have a guard with a rifle			0
i hope they come back in one piece			0

a team of scientists is travelling to @entity27 to observe the solar eclipse
they will use an array of instruments to look at the sun 's corona
this is plasma around the sun that can only be seen during a total eclipse
they hope to work out why the corona is 300 times hotter than the surface
friday 's eclipse will peak in the @entity55 at about 9.35am *gmt*
