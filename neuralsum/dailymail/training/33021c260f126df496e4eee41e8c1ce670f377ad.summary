it has been struck by a @entity2 bomb , torn apart by @entity4 gis and left in squalor by a pagan cult			1
so when the ruins of an ancient church were discovered in thick woodland by @entity11 , he could have been forgiven for thinking its fate had already been sealed			2
instead , the determined church warden used his retirement to embark on a 22 - year crusade to return the dilapidated building to its former glory – despite receiving a death threat from the cult			1
determined : @entity11 has spent 22 years restoring the church in @entity22 , @entity23 to its past glory but even he was surprised when his noble @entity26 effort threw up an unexpected gift , unearthing ancient paintings inside its ivy - covered walls			1
the images depict the @entity31 and the @entity32 and are thought to have been created in 1090 , soon after the @entity33			0
believed to be the oldest wall paintings in @entity36 , they have seen the tiny church become an international tourist attraction			0
they have even earned mr @entity11 , 85 , an mbe after prince @entity41 made several visits to the church			2
mr @entity11 heard about the tower in 1992 when his late wife @entity45 came across it on a ramble near @entity22 , @entity23 , with her @entity48 group			1
transformation : the church was engulfed in ivy in 1992 and looks like a different building today thought to have been last used in the 1930s , it had no roof , door or windows			0
mr @entity11 and his wife had to push through piles of rubbish outside to get in			0
they were horrified to find that a satanic temple and pagan altar had been made in the church , which was built around 1000 ad			1
mr @entity11 managed to gain protected status for the church , then sold his antiques business so he could work on its restoration			1
significant : the ancient wall painting shows good souls leaving their graves on a journey to heaven new chapter : a photo of the purification service in 1992 - following the church 's occupation by satanic cults he said : ‘ i feel i have a relationship with the building			2
i have got a funny feeling that i was always meant to save it			0
’ recounting his first encounter with the property and the pagan imagery within , mr @entity11 said : ‘ this annoyed me intensely			2
i ’ve been a @entity89 all my life and was n’t putting up with this on my patch			0
’ because the site was still consecrated he was able to start services straight away , the first being a purification event following the pagan rituals			0
dilapidated : the church 's interior walls are cracked and worn by the years in these pictures from 1992 early days : two years into the project , in 1994 , the church 's roof has been cleared of ivy he initially had to guard the property at night to deter the cult members , who once drove a car at him and sent him a death threat			1
he even enlisted the @entity110 to guard it for a time after the pagans smeared the walls with blood			0
in spite of some local opposition , he built a road to the church under an old law stating that any consecrated site should have an access route			0
progress : this photo from 1996 shows the roof of the @entity23 church being rebuilt the church today , with a cross in the yard to ward off devil worshippers ( left ) and an upside - down cross carved by satanic cult members on the inside church wall ( right ) he has also faced opposition from church authorities , who initially wanted the building to be torn down			1
it was during his attempts to fix a wall that had been cracked by a @entity2 bomb that mr @entity11 noticed the unique paintings			1
he soon realised the walls were covered in dazzling religious murals that had been covered in whitewash plaster			1
a large section of the artwork is yet to be uncovered as mr @entity11 battles to raise the funds for the specialist teams needed to remove the plaster			2
he added : ‘ it ’s cost me a lot of money , it ’s cost me no end of time , but look what i ’ve got out of it			0
you ’ve got to do something when you retire – you ca n’t sit around watching the telly all day			0
’ @entity11 and his late wife @entity45 in 2005 - it was @entity45 who first told her husband about the abandoned church recounting his first encounter with the property and the pagan imagery within , mr @entity11 said : ‘ this annoyed me intensely			1
i ’ve been a @entity89 all my life and was n’t putting up with this on my patch ’			0

@entity11 began work on the @entity23 tower when he retired 22 years *ago*
1000 - year - old church last used in 1930s before it was hit by a @entity2 bomb
when he first entered he was horrified to find satanic temple and pagan altar
the @entity89 guarded church from cult members who once drove car at him
during restoration he discovered dazzling religious murals hidden by plaster
