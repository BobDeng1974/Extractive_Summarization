so as well as taking @entity6 's life , you have ruined your own life			2

' she added : ' as a doctor , even in a social context , you were in a position of authority			0
he had taken a great deal more of the class c drug than any of the other three of you			0

' an ambulance was called , and as they waited they tried to resuscitate mr @entity9 but realised his airway was blocked			2
' mr @entity110 , who knew mr @entity9 had a fetish for sniffing socks and putting them in his mouth , found he had a sock blocking his throat , and pulled it out			1
paramedics then arrived , but mr @entity9 was already beyond help			2
' @entity6 was arrested in the street nearby on suspicion of murder			0
that was later reduced to supplying drugs			0

spirit : after his death , mr @entity9 's parents said their son had been a ' kind , caring , intelligent and very talented young man , with a generous spirit ' the court heard mr @entity9 died of respiratory failure as a result of a blockage of his airway , although the drugs were said to be a ‘ direct contributor ’ to that			1
@entity196 , defending , said : ' this was a talented student , and the consequence of his death has caused terrible grief to his family			0
' this case is tragic in many ways			0
at the heart of it is the death of a talented student , and in the dock to face the consequences is a gifted doctor			0
' the case is complicated by this fact : as we understand it , the cause of death was asphyxiation			0
' what the deceased had done was put a sock in his mouth which , according to mr @entity110 , he had partially swallowed			2
nobody knew it was there until after his death			0

' he said there was a ' stand - out reference ' from dr @entity254 , a member of the @entity256 's disciplinary tribunal , who described @entity6 as ' among the best she has ever worked with			2
' mr @entity257 added : ' the sad fact is that having devoted so many years of his life to becoming a doctor , he has put his career in jeopardy because of the irresponsibility he displayed during that social gathering			0
' that is something he will have to live with , together with the guilt and feeling of responsibility over the death of the deceased			0
