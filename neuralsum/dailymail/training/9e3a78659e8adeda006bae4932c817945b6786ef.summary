a pro-life pregnancy center in @entity1 is now offering a little - tested and unproven ' abortion reversal ' treatment free - of - charge for women who regret starting the process of medically terminating a pregnancy			1
doctors at the @entity8 in @entity9 say they introduced the controversial option in response to the prevalence of @entity13 , or @entity13 , better known as the ' abortion pill '			1
the pill is an alternative to a surgical abortion , which blocks progesterone and causes the uterine lining to break down , effectively stopping the pregnancy , according to @entity21			1
while the morning - after pill - also known as @entity25 or emergency contraception - helps prevent pregnancy , the abortion pill - also known as a medical abortion - terminates pregnancy			1
the ' abortion reversal ' is meant to come in during this step			2
the @entity8 administer progesterone treatments to patients that have taken @entity13 but have not yet taken the second pill			1
the treatments are meant to override the effects of the steroid , allowing the pregnancy to continue			0
however other doctors have slammed the treatment , saying it is ' very incomplete ' and ' misleading '			1
the executive director of the @entity8 , @entity51 , believes some women will take @entity13 and regret their decision			1
' because of our close proximity to @entity56 , we knew that there would be a woman who would take that first pill and want to reverse the procedure			1
' the center 's medical director , dr. @entity61 , @entity63 , learned of the treatment through @entity65 , a non-medical , @entity32 , pro-life organization , and elected to begin providing it a few weeks ago , according to @entity21			0
common : taking @entity13 , or @entity13 , better known as the ' abortion pill ' , is what is known as a medical abortion , and is an alternative a surgical abortion ' because of our close proximity to @entity56 ( located directly across the street ) , we knew that there would be a woman who would take that first pill and want to reverse the procedure , ' @entity72 said			1
' and shortly after we began providing the treatment , we received our first phone call , so we know the demand is there			0
' no other clinic has advertised the service			0
the @entity8 does not charge patients for the progesterone treatments			1
it is also yet to have a patient undergo the treatments			0
@entity72 says 230 other pro-life @entity63 - @entity89 are looking at offering the service			0
however it has not been properly tested or proven completely effective			0
only one study has been done on the treatment and it was co-authored by the physician who developed it , dr. @entity94			2
in the study , four of the six women who underwent progesterone treatments after taking @entity13 had regular vaginal births			1
but , crucially , the outcomes of the other two women were not listed			0
the website of dr. @entity94 's promotes progesterone therapy as an effective way to reverse a medical abortion , however it has not been properly tested and is only offered at one clinic in @entity1 ' it 's a very incomplete report , ' dr. @entity108 , an @entity63 and member of the @entity110 , told @entity21			1
' it 's not a clinical trial			0
we have no evidence that this is an effective regimen , and i would say that it is outside the standard of care to use a treatment that has not been examined in clinical trials			0
' the side effects of undergoing progesterone treatments are relatively minor , and include hair loss , insomnia , breast tenderness and nausea			2
however dr. @entity108 said the headlining problem with clinics offering the service is that they are misleading partients into thinking they can reverse a medical abortion			1
he also said it 's ' exceedingly rare ' for a woman to change her mind after undergoing the necessary abortion counseling before taking the drug			0
' this seems more like a media campaign than an attempt to provide a service that is actually needed , ' dr @entity108 said			0
' and that 's on top of the fact that this treatment has n't even been proven effective			0
' on saturday the @entity148 was contacted by @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity110 , who said she was a co-author of the study of the progesterone treatments			2
dr. @entity149 said that two of the six women in the study suffered miscarriages			2
she said that they have further tested 106 women , and that 56 - just over half - ' have given birth to normal babies '			2
however the results of that study have not been published , and do not appear on the @entity164 website .			0

@entity8 in @entity9 , @entity1 , first clinic to introduce the option free - of - charge
treatment claims to reverse the effects of ' abortion pill ' @entity13 - which blocks progesterone - by giving women progesterone *supplements*
one study has been done with six women
four of the women had regular vaginal births
other physicians have called it ' very incomplete ' and ' misleading '
