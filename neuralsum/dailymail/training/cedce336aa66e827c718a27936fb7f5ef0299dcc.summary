when @entity1 arrived at @entity2 , some were sceptical			1
why had @entity2 effectively traded a young , homegrown star in @entity4 , for an ageing @entity5 in @entity1 ? a few weeks later , @entity1 is already being heralded as a new hero			1
the @entity8 international has established himself as the new rock at the centre of @entity2 's midfield , winning man of the match in his first two appearances for @entity2			2
in just five @entity18 games , the former @entity16 man has had 679 touches , and made 558 successful passes , giving him a pass completion rate of 89 per cent			1
the high point came on saturday afternoon in @entity23 , where @entity1 not only secured @entity2 's defensive structure in a somewhat reckless 3 - 3 - 4 formation , but also set about breaking as many records as possible			1
@entity1 confounds his critics in emphatic fashion with some scintillating displays for @entity2 @entity1 has proven his passing talent remains undiminished despite the midfielder being 32 years old @entity1 completed 175 passes against @entity23 on saturday , more than the entire opposition team his 175 completed passes in 90 minutes were more than opponents @entity35 managed as a whole team			1
he also had 206 touches of the ball , smashing the previous @entity18 record , which @entity42 and @entity2 team - mate @entity41 had set at 177 last season			1
@entity1 remained humble after the game , saying “ it 's nice ( to have broken the record ) , but i 'll have to look at the statistics myself			2
the @entity49 press were less reserved , singing @entity1 's name from the rooftops			1
“ @entity1 is the new linker and thinker in @entity2 's game ! ” cried @entity52			2
@entity56 described him as a “ phenomenon ” , and calculated that the @entity5 had touched the ball around every 26 seconds in the 2 - 0 win over @entity23			1
the former @entity16 and @entity60 man touched the ball 206 times against @entity23 , a @entity18 record this graphic shows the successful 175 passes that @entity1 made in @entity2 's 2 - 0 win over @entity23 given that @entity1 only cost @entity2 around 6.5 million pounds , @entity68 fans may be wondering why the major @entity70 clubs did not make more of an effort to sign him			1
upon @entity1 's arrival , he did admit that he was reluctant to return to @entity70 for fear of tainting his @entity16 legacy , and also said that @entity75 had been a huge factor in his decision to go to @entity2			1
with only a two year contract , @entity1 is seen as a short term solution for @entity2 , and the club reportedly chose to sign him rather than @entity81 for that reason			2
in a couple of years , @entity1 is expected to make way for the younger midfielders emerging from @entity2 's youth set up			2
for now , though , the new signing 's immediate impact in @entity2 's midfield is particularly crucial given their current injury crisis			0
with @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 all out long term , @entity2 's options in central defence and defensive midfield have taken a severe hit			0
@entity1 has filled the gap effortlessly			0
a major factor in @entity1 turning down moves to the @entity68 this summer was @entity75 the @entity5 won the man of the match award in his first two games for the @entity106 side this season worries remain , however , over @entity1 's own fitness			1
the @entity5 is reportedly suffering from long term ankle problems , and apparently only takes part in full training once or twice a week			0
for the rest of the time , he is limited to light jogging			0
@entity75 expressed his concerns about @entity1 's fitness earlier in the month , saying : “ he ca n't do everything			0
he ca n't play every game with this much energy , or he 'll be dead in a month ”			0
that , even in the figurative sense , would be a disaster for @entity2			0
for while the team struggles to adapt to new tactical innovations and serious injury blows , it is @entity1 who is plugging the gaps			0
it is @entity1 driving them to victory			0
it is @entity1 keeping the @entity2 ship steady			0
if he stays fit , the gentleman @entity5 could prove to be the signing of the year .			0

32 - year - old @entity1 has *quickly* won over any skeptics to his signing
the @entity5 was awarded man of the match in his first two matches for @entity2
the former @entity16 and @entity60 man has had 679 touches and made 558 successful passes ( with an 89 *%* completion rate ) in just five @entity18 matches
he completed 175 passes against @entity23 , more than the entire opposition team
he also had 206 touches of the ball in that match , breaking @entity2 team - mate @entity41 's @entity18 record of 177 set last season
this equates to him touching the ball roughly every 26 seconds , according to the @entity49 press
