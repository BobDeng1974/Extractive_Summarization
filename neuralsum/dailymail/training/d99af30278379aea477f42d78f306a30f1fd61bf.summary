warning : @entity0 blamed his behaviour on his restrictive background a pharmacist who made crude remarks to three of his female colleagues has escaped with a warning after a panel heard he came from a ' restrictive @entity9 background ' and was unaware of the offence his conduct had caused			1
@entity0 asked one of the women about her favourite love - making position and quizzed another about the mating habits of her horses - but a professional panel ruled his behaviour was not sexually motivated			1
the @entity20 panel found @entity0 acted inappropriately by making the comments and standing too close to his assistants			1
however , they accepted that his background in a strict @entity9 community meant he was unfamiliar to working in such an open environment with women and his basic social skills meant he lacked understanding of appropriate conduct			1
as the remarks were not sexually motivated the panel cleared @entity0 of misconduct and gave him an official warning			1
it also took into consideration the fact that @entity0 had remedied his actions by attending a ' dignity at work ' course			1
@entity43 chairman @entity42 said : ‘ he felt the source of this behaviour in 2009 , was that he comes from a very restrictive background , with little social life , and none at all outside of his own community			1
‘ he lacked social skills , and had little knowledge of how one should be when working with colleagues			2
‘ he was unable to distinguish between friendliness and over familiarity			0
’ mr @entity55 added : ‘ we do not think there is a serious risk of this kind of conduct being repeated			0
‘ although we do not find the registrant impaired , we have the ability to issue a warning , and given the circumstances of this case , we believe it is necessary to do so			0
’ in a statement read to the hearing one of @entity0 ’s colleagues , referred to as @entity70 , said she was working with @entity0 at the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74 , in july 2009 , when he asked : ‘ do you have a boyfriend ? do you want a boyfriend ? ’ she said : ‘ whenever it went quiet he came back to me and stood close again			2
he asked me if i was into sports , i said “ no ”			0
‘ he said he was into boxing and said feel my stomach			0
he grabbed my wrist and tried to get me to touch his stomach			0
' @entity0 had told the hearing that he had no desire to be in a relationship with the woman saying : ‘ i suppose i was showing off , at the time , that i train , i work hard			2
' he made similar remarks to another assistant , referred to only as @entity90 , while he was working as a locum at a @entity93 pharmacy in @entity94 , @entity95 , in november 2009			0
the pharmacist approached her while she was at the computer at and asked her if she had a boyfriend and how she liked to have sex with him			0
a similar incident occurred the following week in which he put his arms around her waist			0
one of the incidents happened while @entity0 was working at the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74 ( pictured ) a third woman , known as @entity108 , was working at the same pharmacy when @entity0 stood close to her that as she bent down to pick up some prescriptions , she could not help but back into him			2
she added that he had asked if getting her horses ’ castrated had affected the animals ’ sex drives and whether it would have the same effect on a man			0
he had admitted that all the incidents took place but denied any possible sexual motivation			0
speaking afterwards @entity120 , said on behalf of mr @entity0 : ‘ i think the panel ’s decision was overall correct			1
‘ although mr @entity0 had not acted with sexual motivation , and although he had crossed professional boundaries , it is clear that through his insight and his remedial actions and courses followed , the correct decision has been made to assess that he is not impaired			1
‘ however it must be said that with mr @entity0 ’s failure to observe professional boundaries , which brought him to this hearing , it is correct that the panel warned him about his future behaviour			1
‘ the duration of the inquiry into these matters , being three years , has caused mr @entity0 and his family to be emotionally damaging , at a great deal financial of cost			2

professional panel accepted @entity0 *'s* conduct was not sexually - motivated
he *claimed* his strict @entity9 background meant he lacked basic understanding of appropriate workplace behaviour
@entity0 was cleared of professional misconduct and was instead given an official warning
