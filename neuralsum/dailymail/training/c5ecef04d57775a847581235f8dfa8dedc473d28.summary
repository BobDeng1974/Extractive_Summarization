by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 in the 1960s , it seemed like the future of air travel was supersonic , but in 2003 @entity7 made its final flight			2
now , hopes for super speedy journeys by air have been rekindled as a number of companies have unveiled concepts for supersonic jets of the future			2
the concepts coincide with @entity18 tests that are hoping to find a way to create an aircraft that is quieter than @entity7			1
it is hoped new supersonic aeroplanes designed to carry civilian passengers could be ready within the next 15 years			2
is the future supersonic ? hopes for super speedy journeys by air have been rekindled as a number of companies , including @entity28 ( pictured ) have unveiled concepts for supersonic jets of the future , and @entity18 has begun tests to work out a way of creating an aircraft that is not as noisy as @entity7 was in a conventional supersonic aircraft , shockwaves from the nose , cockpit , inlets , wings and other features come together as they move through the atmosphere into strong shocks emanating from the nose and tail			1
these are known as bow and tail shocks , respectively			0
as these shockwaves pass over someone on the ground , air pressure rises sharply , declines , then rises rapidly again - it ’s this that produces the classic ‘ double - bang ’ sonic boom			2
reshaping the aircraft to produce a longer , more slender shape that slips through the air is the best way to generate shockwaves of lower , more equal strength that attenuate as they pass through the atmosphere and do not form into such strong bow and tail shocks			2
stretching the nose to break the bow shock into a series of weaker shockwaves is particularly effective			0
this lowers and spreads that initial pressure peak and softens the first bang of the sonic boom			0
aeronautics engineers at @entity18 are working to define a new standard for low sonic booms and are presenting their work at @entity79 , the annual event of the @entity81 , in @entity82			1
they have been busy gathering data in order to create new , quieter planes that could help overturn the current ban on supersonic flight over land			1
‘ lessening sonic booms - shock waves caused by an aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound - is the most significant hurdle to reintroducing commercial supersonic flight , ’ said @entity89 , head of the @entity90 in @entity18 ’s @entity91 , @entity92			1
‘ other barriers include high altitude emissions , fuel efficiency and community noise around airports			0
’ aeronautics engineers at @entity18 are working to define a new standard for low sonic booms			1
they have flown @entity105 mission support aircraft ( pictured ) to create low - intensity sonic booms in a bid to gauge the public 's tolerance to noise at the agency 's @entity111 in @entity113 , @entity114 in a supersonic aircraft , shockwaves from the nose , cockpit , inlets , wings and other features coalesce as they move through the atmosphere			1
as these shockwaves pass over someone on the ground , air pressure rises sharply , declines , then rises rapidly again			0
this produces the ' double - bang ' sonic boom engineers are investigating how to design a low - boom aircraft , as well as measuring the loudness and the annoyance of the boom , by asking people to listen to the sounds in a specially designed noise test chamber			1
the space agency recently flew small planes at supersonic speeds at @entity18 ’s @entity111 in @entity113 , @entity114 , to gauge the public ’s response to the noise			2
scientists are also working on how to design aircraft that reduce the noise of the sonic boom			1
@entity148 , a fluid mechanics engineer at @entity149 , said : ‘ we are working to understand the worldwide @entity150 in predicting sonic booms from an aircraft point of view			1
‘ we found for simple configurations we can analyse and predict sonic booms extremely well			1
for complex configurations we still have some work to do			0
’ designs including a needle - like nose , sleek fuselage , and a delta wing have been tested in wind tunnels and seem to result in lower booms , according to the experts			1
it 's more than a decade since @entity7 ( pictured ) was retired from service			0
no company will build a supersonic passenger plane unless it is allowed to fly supersonically over land - something that was off - limits for @entity7 ' lessening sonic booms - shock waves caused by an aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound - is the most significant hurdle to reintroducing commercial supersonic flight , ' said @entity18 's @entity91			1
pictured is @entity177 's design for a supersonic aircraft @entity180 noise is measured in perceived decibel level ( @entity182 )			1
@entity7 ’s boom was a window - rattling 105 @entity182			0
researchers believe 75 @entity182 would be an acceptable level for unrestricted supersonic flight over land , but @entity18 is aiming more ambitiously for 70 @entity182 or lower			1
this looks achievable for a small supersonic business jet , because boom is proportional to aircraft weight , but is a much greater challenge for a heavier airliner			2
in wind - tunnel tests , designs from both @entity28 and @entity177 - funded by @entity18 - which would carry between 30 and 80 passengers , achieved boom levels as low as 79 @entity182			1
at this level , the sonic boom would be more of a thump than a loud bang			0
@entity18 is setting the bar even higher - it thinks 70 @entity182 is achievable with more refinement			2
studies are still taking place to try to reduce the volume level even further			0
@entity18 and industry engineers claim supersonic research has progressed to the point where the design of a practical low - boom supersonic jet is within reach			1
@entity18 and industry engineers say they believe supersonic research has progressed to the point where the design of a practical low - boom supersonic jet is within reach			1
here @entity177 's design , with a long needle - like nose and delta wing intended to cut the noise of a sonic boom , is tested in a wind tunnel the space agency is not the only firm working on building the supersonic jet of the future			1
companies such as @entity228 and @entity229 are looking to take business jets supersonic			0
@entity231 - based @entity229 has designed a supersonic jet called the @entity233 that it claims could carry 12 to 18 passengers at 1,100mph ( 1,700 km / h ) , or @entity235			1
it claims the craft could cut flight times in half so passengers could fly from @entity240 to @entity241 in just three hours , of from @entity242 to @entity243 in six hours			0
@entity177 unveiled its vision for a supersonic future at the aviation event , with a concept featuring two engines under a sleek aircraft ’s wings and one on top of the fuselage			1
once @entity255 is fully operational , @entity256 has also set his sights on supersonic travel and has plans to create supersonic planes aircraft enough to travel from @entity240 to @entity243 in less than an hour , @entity254 reported			2
‘ after we 've done the space program , we will be producing supersonic planes , which will go far , far , faster than @entity7 … you could be traveling at 19,000 miles per hour orbitally , ’ he said			0
@entity265 could be superseded by something even faster			0
@entity267 2.5 is about the speed limit for gas - turbine engines			0
any faster and the temperature and pressure of air entering the engine is too high for the turbo machinery inside			0
to fly at hypersonic speed - @entity275 and above - requires a different type of engine			0
a supersonic - combustion ramjet , or scramjet , has no moving parts			0
instead of the rotating compressor and turbine in a jet engine , air is compressed and expanded by complex systems of shockwaves under the front of the aircraft , inside the inlet and under the fuselage at the rear			2
scramjets have been under development for decades , but a breakthrough came in may 2013 , when the @entity297 ’s @entity296 flew for 240 seconds over the @entity298 on scramjet power , reaching @entity300 and running until its fuel was exhausted			0
the next step is to build a high - speed cruise missile , able to strike distant targets in minutes , not hours			0
@entity177 ’s @entity306 - builder of the @entity309 @entity308 spyplane - has unveiled plans to develop a successor , dubbed the @entity312 ( pictured above )			2
designed for reconnaissance and strike missions , the @entity312 would combine turbojet and ramjet / scramjet engines to enable the aircraft to take off from a runway , accelerate to a @entity321 cruise , and then return to a conventional runway landing			0
if it can secure funding from the @entity324 , @entity177 believes a prototype could be flying as soon as 2023 and the @entity312 could enter service by 2030 , potentially paving the way for commercial applications of scramjet technology .			0
