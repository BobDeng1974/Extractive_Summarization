by @entity1 reporter published : 10:28 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 11:07 est , 17 may 2012 shocking treatment : pregnant woman @entity3 a pregnant woman was tasered three times by police officers after she was pulled over for speeding while taking her son to school			1
@entity3 , who was due to give birth two months later , accepted that she had been travelling at 32mph in a 20mph zone outside the @entity14 in @entity15			2
but when she refused to sign the ticket because she wrongly thought it was an admission of guilt , the officers moved in to arrest her			0
she was ordered to get out of her vehicle , but she again refused to comply , so one officer twisted her arm behind her back while another tasered her in the thigh			0
thirty seconds later , she was tasered again , this time in her left arm followed by another jolt to her neck			0
she finally fell over and was dragged face down into the street before being cuffed with her hands behind her back			0
ms @entity3 , who went on to give birth to a healthy baby girl , was later convicted of refusing to sign the ticket , although not for resisting arrest			2
excessive force ? ms @entity3 was hit in the thigh , arm and neck before being dragged out of her vehicle and handcuffed but the case has made its way to highest court in the @entity42 after the @entity15 mother tried to sue the three officers for causing injuries that left her with three permanent scars			1
the officers won a split decision in october from a 10 - member panel of the @entity51 in @entity52			0
the judges ruled that the officers had used excessive force , but were not liable for damages because the law on the issue was not clear in 2004 , when the incident happened , it was reported in the @entity58			1
the taser had been used in ' drive - stun ' mode , which delivers only localised pain , which the panel deemed not to be a safety threat			0
appeal : although being cleared of using excessive force , the three officers have now gone to the @entity65 ( above ) in an attempt to preserve the technique but they said it could give rise to a lawsuit for a jury to decide on			1
chief judge @entity72 said ms @entity3 had been ' deaf to reason ' and that the officers ' deserved our praise '			1
but the cops have now decided to appeal to the @entity65 in an attempt to clarify the law and preserve what they believe to be a ' useful pain technique			1
' ms @entity3 , who is pursing claims under state law , has urged the court not to hear the appeal			2
@entity87 , a lawyer at @entity88 , which represents ms. @entity3 , told the @entity58 : ' the officers are trying to defend inexcusable conduct			2
' they inflicted enormous pain on a woman who was especially vulnerable over what was essentially a traffic violation			0

@entity3 lost damages claim even though judges said officers had used excessive force
now they have gone to court in *bid* to preserve ' useful pain technique '
