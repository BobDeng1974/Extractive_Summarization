by @entity1 reporter published : 18:38 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 18:49 est , 15 october 2013 the blood - stained shirt that the governor of @entity5 was wearing while riding inside the car with president @entity7 on the day he was shot has now been put on display			1
governor @entity9 was seated in front of the president in the open - top convertible when the shooting occurred , and he was hit in the chest			1
now the bloody shirt and suit that @entity9 wore on that day when he nearly died have been put on display as part of an exhibit being organized in coordination with the 50th anniversary of @entity7 's assassination			1
part of history : the suit and shirt that governor @entity9 wore on the day of the @entity7 assassination have been put on display as part of the 50th anniversary commemorations bullet hole : @entity9 was shot in the chest but managed to be saved , unlike president @entity7 close : @entity9 was seated directly in front of president @entity7 in the fatal car ride on november 22 , 1963 it will be the first public display since 1964 for the clothing @entity9 wore november 22 , 1963 , during @entity7 's visit			1
the white @entity36 brand shirt , size 16 with a 35 - inch sleeve , has faded over the years and the now brown blood stains and spatters cover nearly all of it			0
there are bullet holes in the shirt 's chest , back shoulder and right cuff and three buttons are missing , presumably due to emergency medical responders ripping the garment away to reach @entity53 's chest wound			0
the damage to the three - button suit , from @entity56 in @entity57 , is less pronounced			0
his wife @entity58 had it cleaned before it was presented to the state archives , @entity62 said , so there 's no evidence of blood but the coat has bullet holes that match those on the shirt , plus a hole on the left leg just above and toward the inside of the knee			0
jarring : this is the first time that the shirt and suit will be publicly displayed , seen here in the @entity78 in @entity79 shot in the chest : the bullet could have killed @entity9 but he was saved at the hospital emergency room staff at @entity85 ' @entity84 removed the clothing from @entity9 after the shooting since he was seriously wounded			1
@entity62 , preservation officer at the archives , said the display tells an important aspect of a well - known story			0
' for @entity93 , this is something that maybe gets forgotten by some of the rest of the world , that governor @entity9 was shot at the same time , ' he said , noting that @entity9 's chest wound could have been fatal			1
part of history : conservator @entity102 is seen next to the shirt that was donated by @entity9 's wife ' the first thing that jumps out at you is the damage , ' said @entity108 , who has been assembling the exhibit for several months			2
' the most dramatic is the shirt			0
' the shirt and suit are jarring , but they are not necessarily the best - known pieces of clothing from the fatal day			2
the pink blood - stained suit that first lady @entity7 was wearing at the time of the shooting , but that will not be part of the exhibit since it is held at the @entity78 in @entity122			2
it has never been displayed .			0
