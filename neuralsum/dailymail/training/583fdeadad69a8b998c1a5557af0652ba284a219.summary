the bog body in the @entity17 , in @entity12 , was found by @entity18 , @entity20 operator archaeologists have speculated that he could have been used in a type of ritual sacrifice , which was more common in the later @entity25			1
the mummy was dug from the @entity27 na @entity30 bog in @entity31 around two years ago by a @entity30 worker who was operating a milling machine , @entity28 reported			1
experts first presumed that the remains dated from the @entity25 period , which stretched from 500 @entity2 to 400 ad , matching other bodies found in @entity13 bogs			1
but radiocarbon tests confirmed the body dated from the early @entity41 - some 4,000 years ago			2
analysis on the peat that buried the body and a wooden stake found with the remains confirmed the assessment			0

sadly archaeologists will never know if the boy received blows to his head , neck or chest , which are typically targeted in a deliberate attack , as his body was cut up with a milling machine ( pictured ) when it was discovered while scientists will probably never know the cause of death , mr @entity52 said the wounds on the body alongside the presence of wooden stakes , suggest that the boy was a victim of a ritual sacrifice			1
the body was also found near an inauguration site , which strengthens his theory			0
he told the newspaper : ' it seems to be same type of ritual that we ’ve observed in later @entity25 finds			0
what ’s surprising here is that it ’s so much earlier			0
' while scientists will probably never know the cause of death , the wounds on the body alongside the presence of wooden stakes , suggest that the boy was a victim of a ritual sacrifice the archaeologist also believes the victim was probably from a relatively important family as similar bodies recovered did not have calluses on their hands and their fingernails were well cared for			1
however , the hands were missing from this particular body			0
mr @entity52 said : ' we believe that the victims of these ritual killings are kings that have failed in their kingship and have been sacrificed as a consequence			0
' more than 100 ancient bodies have been pulled from @entity129 's bogs , which can preserve bodies for thousands of years , but few have been as well preserved as this one the national museum of @entity13 is waiting for more test results which should reveal what the man ate before he died			1
