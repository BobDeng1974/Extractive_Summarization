by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 , mail online deputy political editor and @entity4 and @entity5 @entity6 were accused of scaremongering by a @entity9 minister yesterday after the number of @entity11 and @entity12 working in @entity13 fell slightly			1
those in jobs from the two countries dropped by 4,000 in the three months after employment restrictions were lifted on january 1 compared to the three months before			1
but despite the surprise dip the total number working here was up by 29,000 – nearly 26 per cent – in the first quarter of this year compared to the equivalent period in 2013			2
there were 140,000 @entity11 and @entity12 working in @entity13 in january - march , down from 144,000 at the end of 2013 the @entity25 said there were 140,000 people from the two eastern @entity29 countries in jobs in the @entity13 between january and march this year			1
@entity6 's @entity31 was roundly attacked today for stoking fears that @entity13 would be swamped by @entity11 and @entity12			1
figures showed that the number of migrants arriving in the @entity13 from the two countries actually fell in the first three months of the year that was down from 144,000 in the three months to december , before @entity11 and @entity12 gained the same rights to work in @entity13 as other @entity40 citizens			1
the figures do not include dependent family members of immigrant workers or the unemployed			0
before employment restrictions were lifted ministers repeatedly refused to estimate how many @entity11 and @entity12 would arrive in the @entity13 , leading @entity6 to raise concerns that a ‘ massive influx ’ would place extra demands on public services and depress wages			1
amid growing worries the government introduced measures to prevent @entity40 migrants from claiming unemployment benefits for their first three months here , while those found begging or sleeping rough could be deported			2
yesterday , after the figures were published , @entity59 police minister @entity58 hit out at the rhetoric from @entity31 ’s party			0
he said : ‘ they started scaremongering in the run - up to january 1			2
they have been proved wrong and they have decided to carry on scaremongering			0
’ @entity59 minister @entity68 said : ‘ these figures just show that @entity6 preys on people ’s fears , it preys on prejudices in many people			1
and they make these wild , actually rather offensive claims , and hey , what happens ? it was all a load of nonsense			2
’ employment minister @entity80 said the predicted influx had not happened @entity83 business secretary @entity82 added : ‘ this idea of waiting for tens of thousands of people pouring off the planes from the @entity87 was just a scare story			2
’ @entity90 mp @entity89 , chairman of the @entity91 , said : ‘ those , including @entity6 , who promised the end of the world on january 1 , now owe the public and those from @entity11 and @entity12 a full apology			1
’ but critics pointed out that the number of workers from @entity11 and @entity12 had increased by 43,000 – or 44 per cent – since the first three months of 2012			1
they also suggested that the december peak meant many arrived in the @entity13 in time for the lifting of employment restrictions			0
sir @entity105 , chairman of @entity106 , said : ‘ the latest annual figures show an increase of 29,000 , in a period when restrictions were in place for nine months			2
we believe they are consistent with our estimate of a 50,000 population increase from @entity11 and @entity12 for each of the next five years			1
’ dr @entity117 , senior researcher at the @entity118 at the @entity119 , said : ‘ until we have complete data for 2014 it is impossible to achieve any definite conclusions about the impact of the end of restrictions			2
’ @entity6 head of policy @entity126 said : ‘ we never said it would just be about @entity11 and @entity12			1
we are looking at the massive influx from the @entity40			0
’ the number of @entity11 and @entity12 working in the @entity13 is up by almost 26 per cent year - on - year , compared to 1.8 per cent for people born in the @entity13			1
there are a record 30.430million people in work , up by 283,000 on the end of last year unemployment has fallen by more than 300,000 over the past year , giving jobless rates of 7 per cent for men and 6.4 per cent for women			1
the number of people in a job rose 283,000 in the last three months - the largest quarterly increase in 43 years			1
the number of unemployed young people has been falling for the last eight months			2
employment minister @entity80 said : ' as the recovery takes hold , more people are able to get a job or set up their own business and become the employers of tomorrow			0
' each and every person who has made a new start or hired someone new is helping to make @entity13 a more prosperous and confident place to be			0
' we will continue to support those in and out of work who want to get on and fulfil their ambitions for a more secure future			0
' the number of people claiming jobseeker 's allowance last month fell by 25,100 to 1.12 million			2
@entity165 , @entity83 chief secretary to the @entity167 , said : ‘ this further big rise in employment shows again that our jobs rich recovery is becoming firmly established			0
' it follows strengthening economic growth figures and positive news on inflation			0
the very modest numbers of @entity11 and @entity12 coming to work in @entity13 this year is in stark contrast to the inflammatory rhetoric of earlier this year			1
' overall today 's figures are good news for the people of @entity13 , and bad news for those who would threaten our recovery by turning the clock back			0
' mr @entity187 yesterday insisted his promise to get immigration below 100,000 a year is still ' achievable '			1
but mr @entity187 insisted : ' the target remains			2
i think it is absolutely achievable '			0
appearing before the @entity193 , he declined to discuss the figures for @entity11 and @entity12 before their publication , but said that his administration had brought net migration down by one - fifth since coming to office			1
he also wants to stop millions of pounds being sent abroad each year in child benefit for children who live elsewhere in the @entity40			0
there are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children , with two - thirds of the children based in @entity206			0
total pay is up by 1.7 per cent , while the @entity209 rate of inflation is at 1.6 per cent mr @entity187 said he had not made ' anybody who thinks that is sensible ' but admitted that under existing @entity40 rules ' it seems impossible to change that '			1
he told @entity216 's @entity215 : ' we are very clear about what we want to achieve			0
let 's end benefit tourism , let 's make sure the single market is properly safeguarded			0
' let 's make sure that @entity224 can get together and block unwelcome proposals from the @entity226			0
' let 's make a series of changes to make @entity29 more flexible , more competitive			0
those are the sorts of things i want to see			0

@entity68 says @entity6 made ' wild , rather offensive ' migrant predictions
but admits @entity187 unlikely to *honour* pledge to slash net migration
there were 140,000 @entity11 and @entity12 in work in january - march
down from 144,000 at the end of 2013 , but up *28,000* year - on - year
more than 30.4 million people are now in work , a new record high
more than *280,000* find work in three months , biggest increase ever
