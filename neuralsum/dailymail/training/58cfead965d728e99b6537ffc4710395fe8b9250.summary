by @entity0 and @entity1 when former x factor judge @entity2 appeared in court last fortnight for a hearing related to allegations that she arranged a drug deal , concern over the singer 's face , which appeared noticeably puffy and swollen , was raised			1
though she has previously denied having had a nose job and lip fillers , the former @entity14 star 's face was markedly different to the fresh - faced girl who burst onto the pop music scene in 2007			1
but 25 - year - old @entity2 may have offered an explanation			1
in his @entity23 column , @entity20 , @entity21 writes that the singer has denied having had any cosmetic work done , claiming : ' it is all down to clever make - up			1
celebrity make - up artist @entity41 believes @entity2 's dramatic new look could well be down to her new beauty regime			1
speaking about @entity2 's face , which appeared slightly ' pulled back ' and swollen a few weeks ago , he said : ' @entity2 's make - up has really changed since her early days			1
' now she goes for a heavily contoured look to slim the face and add shape			2
she also contours her nose , which again slims and adds dimension			0
' how you contour your face can totally have a dramatic change to your face			2
concealer can be used to lift and brighten and bronzer to shade and define			0
' lip liner and lip plumping products could be responsible for the plumper pout but remember make - up is all smoke and mirrors			1
' the power of the brush : a celebrity make - up artist believes that @entity2 now goes for a heavily contoured look to slim the face and add shape			1
she also contours her nose , which again slims and adds dimension , he says the singer has persistently denied having any form of plastic surgery and was keen to hide her plumped - up pout as she left a beauty salon in @entity75 in october last year			1
in august last year , she also put her slimmer looking nose down to the fact she had lost weight			0
she told the @entity79 at the time : ' it 's not a deliberate thing , and i really do n't give a toss about being skinny			2
that 's just not me			0
but when i lose weight it goes from my face , and everyone says my nose looks thinner			2
' i swear on my life i 've not had it done			0
i 've literally just lost weight , and it goes from my nose ! ' @entity93 , non surgical director from @entity95 , is n't convinced			0
she said : ‘ looking at the photos provided , @entity2 definitely looks like she has had some kind of temporary dermal filler to her lips and is a very popular treatment with women of @entity2 ’s age			0
@entity2 ’s lips looked thinner in earlier pictures			2
was it all down to the products ? @entity41 believes that lip liner and lip plumping products could be responsible for @entity2 's plumper pout ' the elongated and shiny forehead is a classic tell - tale sign of having injectable wrinkle treatment			2
' her cheeks also look fuller than in earlier photographs			0
' her skin looks quite taut and shiny which would suggest @entity2 has had regular facial peels / skin rejuvenation treatments			0
' it appears @entity2 has indulged in non-surgical treatments of late			0
however @entity2 is very young and less is more and i would encourage using less product and leaving more time in between treatments			0
' cosmetic and plastic surgeon , @entity124 ( @entity125 ) from the @entity126 says : ' i think @entity2 looks great but i can see the tell - tale signs of @entity129 , fillers in her lips and possibly in her cheeks too			1
' she looks like she ’s lost a bit of weight in her face as well which has made her lips look more sensuous and striking			0
' in 2009 ( left ) and 2008 ( right ) @entity2 not only had blonde hair but also a soft and natural looking face at the peak of @entity14 fame ( left , 2010 , right 2011 ) @entity2 's face began to alter along with her hair colour as well as deepening her tan and fostering a bad girl image during her stint as an x factor judge , @entity2 's face continued to transform ( left , 2012 , right , 2013 ) at an appearance at court in january this year @entity2 's lips looked noticeably fuller in march there were yet further differences to the singer 's face , though she has always denied having surgery @entity2 's face looked oddly swollen and full at court last fortnight			1

@entity155 appeared at @entity156 last fortnight
her face looked swollen and pulled back
told the @entity23 it was down to ' clever make - up '
make - up artist says new look could well be down to contouring
@entity167 has always denied *rumours* of plastic surgery in the past
