@entity0 will not be considered for selection by @entity2 for the upcoming @entity3 but his form at @entity5 means @entity7 dream is not over			1
@entity9 names his squad for the @entity3 later this month and will again ignore overseas - based players , most notably @entity0 , under @entity13 guidelines			1
the @entity2 head coach , however , is expected to exercise the ' exceptional circumstances ' clause by selecting the @entity17 back row in his @entity19 training squad in may			1
@entity0 has not been selected by @entity2 since he moved to @entity20 in 2011 @entity0 is widely considered one of the best players in @entity22 , if not the world , and @entity9 has been impressed by his form at no 8 over the last year			2
it has been a problem position for @entity2 since @entity27 took charge in 2012 and he is keen to explore his options			0
@entity31 8 @entity30 won @entity2 's man of the series in the autumn but there are concerns over @entity37 's fitness and big - match temperament			0

the former @entity42 back row , 29 , won @entity45 player of the year last season @entity9 has been reluctant to bow to calls for the 29 - year - old to be selected as he has kept faith in captain @entity50 and @entity52 's @entity51 on the flanks and @entity30 and @entity37 at @entity5			0
but with the @entity7 just eight months away and following a disappointing autumn series he wants his best players available for assessment in may			0
the @entity3 is likely to come too soon for @entity58 rugby league convert @entity59 but he too is likely to be picked for the end - of - season training camp , which will include over 40 players			0
@entity58 's @entity59 ( centre ) is also set to be selected by @entity9 for may 's training camp @entity0 saw a move to @entity58 fall through in october , seemingly scuppering his hopes of adding to his five @entity2 caps before or during the @entity7			1
but should he impress @entity27 in may then he may well be pulling on the @entity67 again come the @entity7 kick - off on september 18 .			2

@entity17 flanker @entity0 has not played for @entity2 since 2009
