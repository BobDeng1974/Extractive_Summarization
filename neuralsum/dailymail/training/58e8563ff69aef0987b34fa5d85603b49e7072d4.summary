a @entity1 row has broken out over terror laws as @entity3 prepares to set out new counter-terrorism measures			1
former @entity5 leader @entity5 - a long - standing ally of current leader @entity6 - has denounced the @entity9 's ' knee jerk ' response to the jihadi terror threat level after it was raised from ' substantial ' to ' severe '			1
but @entity9 defence secretary @entity11 today denied the claims and said the country faced ' very real threats ' amid warnings the @entity17 's defences against jihadis from @entity17 and western @entity19 needed to be stiffened up			1
former @entity5 leader @entity5 , pictured , has questioned the @entity9 response to the terror threat level			1
hitting out at the @entity9 response , @entity5 claimed ministers including mr @entity3 had set out to frighten people in an effort to secure support for new powers			1
changes will be announced by the prime minister in a @entity31 statement tomorrow , after a weekend of discussions with the @entity5 about the details of the package			1
it is understood the measures under consideration would make it easier to remove people 's passports through temporary seizure powers at the border in order to prevent them travelling to the @entity46 trouble zones			1
officials are also looking at the prospect of a ' temporary bar ' on @entity17 citizens suspected of terrorist activity abroad returning , a measure which would stop short of stripping them of citizenship and rendering them stateless			1
the package could also include beefed - up powers under the terrorism prevention and investigation measures ( @entity61 ) regime			2
there have been calls , including from the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation @entity65 , for the ability to impose ' internal exile ' on suspects , a key part of the old control orders regime , to be restored			0
@entity3 is set to announce counter-terrorism measures in a @entity31 statement tomorrow mr @entity11 told the @entity75 programme on @entity76 : ' these are very real threats			1
we have had @entity84 trains blown up , @entity81 buses , @entity79 attacked , a soldier murdered in broad daylight			0
' these are very real threats we are dealing with			2
' this is n't any kind of knee - jerk response			1
the prime minister made clear on friday we need to be calm and measured about the way that we do this			0
' but when we look at our current instruments , our armoury of things or how we deal with these threats , there are some gaps			0
' we 've had a number of young men going off to fight in @entity101 , a number of them slipping back home again			0
' we need to make sure that , where we can , we plug those existing gaps and the prime minister is going to go into more details about that to @entity110 tomorrow			0
' several hundred @entity17 nationals are estimated to have travelled to @entity112 and @entity101 to join the @entity113 ( @entity114 ) uprising , and other western @entity19 countries have also been a source of foreign fighters			1
mr @entity11 said the risk posed by returning jihadis from across @entity19 underlined the need for international action			1
defence secretary @entity11 , pictured , said the country faced ' very real threats ' ' this is now a threat to western @entity19 generally			1
this is going on on our doorstep and this does involve us , because these are fighters who can return from @entity101 and @entity112 to western @entity19			0
' we are all involved in this , this is why we have to do it on a co-ordinated @entity19 level			0
' we have the @entity137 summit in @entity138 taking place later this week and we have to do this collectively , it 's not just for one country on its own			2
' indicating that changes would be made to @entity61 , mr @entity11 said the main problem with the previous control orders regime was that it ran into trouble with judges , rather than @entity5 opposition to the measures			1
he said : ' the major problem with control orders has been the courts , actually , it has n't been the @entity5 , it 's been the courts wanting to make sure people are n't being detained unnecessarily if they are not actually being charged			1
' but we are now looking at all these things			0
we have to stiffen up our defences now , we have to take this threat seriously			2
' he said there were ' people who we know want to do this country harm , we know want to carry out attacks on members of our armed forces or on shopping centres or whatever it is ' and ' we need to do more to stop them '			2
@entity5 , writing in @entity170 , said politicians should not act as ' cheerleaders ' for the demands of the intelligence and security services			2
and he warned that the prime minister 's rhetoric risked alienating moderate @entity178			2
@entity5 has criticised the @entity3 's rhetoric about the struggle against @entity182 extremism he said the threat of terrorism had been faced before ' effectively , without panic and without a whole new range of executive powers that could endanger our liberties '			1
any changes must be ' evidence based , careful of our liberties and sensitive to the need to keep moderate @entity194 on our side ' , @entity5 said			2
the peer criticised the prime minister 's rhetoric about the struggle against @entity182 extremism : ' he recently told us that this fight was about defending ' @entity201 values '			0
i can not think of any phrase , short of those used by @entity205 during the @entity112 war , which more damages our ability to win this battle			0
' @entity211 's former minister @entity210 , who sits on the @entity212 , called for the return of some of the powers available under control orders			0
she told @entity75 : ' many of these extremists are based in @entity81			0
so it was possible under control orders to relocate somebody to @entity222 or to @entity223			0
' that meant both the police could keep a better eye on them but also they were n't part of that organisation that was plotting against us			0
i think that was a really useful power			0
' when the legislation went through @entity110 i almost pleaded with the home secretary to keep that power			0
so if the prime minister 's going to bring that back , i think it 's a very good thing			0
' she added : ' if the home secretary and the prime minister have second thoughts , and @entity6 decides to get off this high horse that he is on and do something practical to protect the @entity17 people , then this is something that i think would help			1
