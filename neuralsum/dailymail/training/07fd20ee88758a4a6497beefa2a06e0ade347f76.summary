by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 05:46 est , 30 september 2013 patient care is being jeopardised by the amount of pressure being put on nurses , according to the @entity5			1
the @entity5 has warned that patients are being put at risk because of nursing staff cuts and excessive workloads			2
the union claimed there is ' unprecedented ' stress on nurses which is leading to many of them suffering from ill health			1
a poll by the @entity5 found that more than half have of nurses in the @entity19 and private sector have been made unwell by stress in the last year			1
while four in five said they have battled through feeling unwell and still gone into work			2
the union warns this is putting patients at risk a poll conducted by the @entity5 on 2,000 nurses working across the @entity19 and private sector found that more than half have been made unwell by stress in the last year			1
while four in five said they have battled through feeling unwell and still gone into work			2
the @entity5 explained that many nurses questioned reported sickness absence policies at their place of work were so punitive they had no alternative but to attend work despite feeling unwell			1
one of the nurses questioned told the @entity5 : ' i 've been told that if i do n't meet the 100 per cent attendance at work i will be up for a capability hearing			1
' i had three admissions into hospital due to a cardiac problem , so if i get chest pain i have to ignore it because i have to go to work			0
' another said : ' i am currently off work following breast cancer , a senior manager called three weeks after my surgery and asked if i was coming back as people with cancer often do n't return and they wanted to fill my post			0
' @entity5 officials also raised concerns about working culture for nurses after 56 per cent said they had experienced physical or verbal violence from patients in the last year and almost a quarter ( 23 per cent ) reported being bullied by their managers the union said if nurses are going into work feeling unwell patient safety could be in jeopardy			1

the @entity5 explained many nurses questioned reported sickness absence policies at their place of work were so punitive they had no alternative but to attend work despite feeling unwell dr @entity81 , general secretary of the @entity5 , said : ' in the aftermath of the @entity84 , it is clearer than ever that working cultures in the @entity19 and beyond have a direct and serious effect on the level of care that staff can provide to patients			1
' our whole care system is currently facing the huge challenge of delivering care at a time of increased demand and scant resource			0
this is the reality which nurses face in every working day			0
' there is much that managers and employers can do , and should be doing , to support staff and keep patients safe			0
' by ensuring there are enough staff to deliver care , and enabling staff to raise concerns safely , the positive working culture which exists in many places could be the reality everywhere			0
' worryingly , this report shows that rather than an environment which supports staff , some employers are instead adopting panic behaviours			0
' staff report being intimidated and blamed , and feel they have no way of speaking out about threats to patient care			1
individual nurses are clearly going the extra mile to make sure the job is done , however , the risk of burnout is very real , and very widespread			0
' a @entity128 spokeswoman said : ' the staff working for our nhs are our health service 's most precious resource			0
nurses are working extremely hard and continue to provide a high quality of care in the face of rising healthcare demands			2
' we want to support nurses as much as possible and are already investing in technology and training , while looking at cutting bureaucracy by a third to allow nurses to focus on patients and not paperwork			2
' recent reports have shown clearly that we need safe numbers on wards and a supportive culture in the @entity19			0
we have already introduced some major changes , such as a chief inspector who will take action on staffing levels			0
