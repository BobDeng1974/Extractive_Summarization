by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 02:08 est , 20 may 2013 @entity2 dictator @entity1 died in prison aged 87 former @entity2 dictator @entity1 died in his sleep while serving life in prison for crimes against humanity aged 87			1
@entity1 took power over @entity2 in a 1976 coup and led a military junta that killed thousands of his fellow citizens in a dirty war to eliminate people considered to be subversives			1
federal prison service director @entity16 said @entity1 died in the @entity18 prison			2
he was found lifeless in his bed and declared dead at 8:25 a.m.			1
@entity1 ran one of the bloodiest military governments during @entity23 's era of dictatorships , and later sought to take full responsibility for kidnappings , tortures , deaths and disappearances when he was tried again and again for these crimes in recent years			1
he said he knew about everything that happened under his rule because ' i was on top of everyone			1
' @entity1 had a low profile before the march 24 , 1976 , coup , but quickly became the architect of a repressive system that killed about 9,000 people according to official accounts			1
human rights activists believe the real number was as high as 30,000			0
in 2003 , during the presidency of @entity45 , the @entity43 nullified the amnesty laws , and a new era of human rights investigations began , finally reaching the trial stage in the last few years			0
in 2010 , @entity1 was condemned to life in prison for killing 31 political dissidents , and was ordered to serve the time in common prison			2
the baby thefts conviction , with its 50 - year sentence , was handed down in 2012			0
all of the crimes involved in both convictions were considered crimes against humanity under @entity2 law			1
@entity1 ultimately served only five years in prison after his right to serve his time at home because of his advanced age was revoked in 2008			2
@entity1 died while standing trial in a case focused on kidnappings and killings related to @entity70			2
this ' dirty war ' introduced two frightening terms to the global lexicon of terror : ' disappeareds ' - people kidnapped and never seen nor heard from again - and ' death flights , ' in which political prisoners were thrown , drugged but alive , from navy planes into the sea			1
@entity2 dictator gen. @entity1 with former @entity81 dictator gen. @entity80 in 1977 complaints from families looking for missing loved ones were later heard internationally , and suggested that the regime many @entity2 initially welcomed as an antidote to political violence and economic chaos was much bloodier than first thought			1
' the disappeareds are n't there , they do n't exist , ' @entity1 told a news conference defensively in 1977			2
@entity1 's dictatorship also stood out from others in @entity95 for its policy of holding pregnant prisoners until they gave birth , and then killing the women while arranging for illegal adoptions of their babies , usually by military or police families			1
this happened hundreds of times , and the @entity107 rights group has relentlessly sought to reunite these children , now in their 30s , with their biological families			0
last year , @entity1 was convicted and sentenced again , to a 50 - year - term , for the thefts of these babies			2
@entity112 , who spent 28 months in prison during the dictatorship and won the @entity115 for his work documenting @entity1 's crimes , said the general 's death should not be cause for celebration , and urged @entity2 's justice system to keep investigating the dirty war era			1
@entity1 was among 46 officials of the former regime being sought for extradition by @entity128 judge @entity127 to face trial for crimes against humanity ' the death of @entity1 should not bring joy to anyone			0
we need to keep working for a better society , more just , more humane , so that all this horror does n't ever happen , never again , ' @entity112 said in an interview with @entity139			0
neither does @entity1 's death end an era , @entity112 said : ' it goes beyond @entity142 , it 's a political system that they implemented throughout the country and in @entity95			0
' @entity1 's regime , known as the ' process of @entity147 , ' fought against armed leftist guerrillas , but these movements were already weakened and nearly destroyed at the time of the coup			1
the junta soon pursued political opponents , union members , student activists and social workers , rousting people from their homes and torturing them in clandestine detention centers			0
the process soon spread internationally as the junta joined @entity70 , an effort launched by @entity163 's dictator , gen. @entity162 to make sure the countries of @entity23 's southern cone provided no refuge to each other 's leftist enemies			0
' @entity81 's dictator @entity80 joined the pact , as did the leaders of @entity172 , @entity173 , and @entity174			0
secret documents released decades later showed that @entity177 secretary of state @entity176 was kept well informed			0
@entity1 told journalists @entity178 and @entity180 , authors of his 2001 biography ' @entity183 , ' that the three essential elements of his state - sponsored terror campaign were clandestine detention centers , torture to obtain information and the subsequent disappearance of the prisoners , so that they " do n't have identity , " and are " neither alive nor dead			1
" @entity1 's junta closed @entity192 , banned political parties , intervened in unions and universities , and imposed an iron censorship over the media			1
the military leaders engineered a joint venture with the owners of the newspapers @entity201 and @entity203 to control newsprint and thus ensure sympathetic coverage			0
the high point of @entity1 's regime came in 1978 , when @entity2 hosted soccer 's @entity208			1
just blocks from the @entity212 stadium where @entity214 's goals made @entity2 the champion , detainees were being tortured inside the @entity216 , a leafy campus where thousands were taken , never to be seen again			0
@entity2 former dictator @entity1 ( @entity220 ) and @entity221 ( @entity222 ) , last president of the dictatorship , attending a judgment against them in @entity227 @entity1 retired in 1981 and handed leadership to a succession of other generals			1
by then the government was already weakened , pressured by persistent inflation , a sluggish economy and explosive growth in foreign debts after nationalizing the debts of leading private corporations			0
the dictators then launched an ill - advised war against @entity240 for the @entity241 , which @entity2 claims as the @entity241 and considers part of its territory			2
that military defeat hastened the return of democracy on dec. 12 , 1983			0
with constitutional rule restored , then - president @entity247 created a truth commission to investigate the dictatorship 's crimes , and its report , titled " never again , " served as the basis for a historic trial of the dictators , which ended with @entity1 's first life sentence in 1985			2
@entity247 's government also passed amnesty laws designed to put an end to human rights trials for everyone other than the junta leaders , and his successor , president @entity264 , then pardoned @entity1 in 1990			2
@entity1 was free until 1998 , when a judge charged him in the baby thefts			0
he spent a month in prison before asserting the right that @entity2 over 70 have to house arrest pending trial			0
@entity1 came from a long line of military officers dating back to @entity2 's war of independence from @entity128			1
he was born on august 2 , 1925 , in @entity275 , a town in @entity277			0
his father , lt. col. @entity1 , participated in an earlier coup that toppled president @entity280 in 1930			2

he married @entity286 in 1948 and had seven children .			0
