no @entity1 match would be complete without some kidology , and some of that duly surrounds the match that everyone in @entity6 wants to see this weekend			1
@entity9 and @entity10 versus world champions @entity7 and @entity8 on saturday looks to be the pivotal rubber of the @entity1 first round knockout match between @entity14 and @entity15 , which begins this afternoon at the @entity16			1
yet the home side were trying to play down expectations that it would happen on thursday			1
@entity20 's @entity19 was officially named to play with @entity10 while the former @entity22 champion insisted it was ' unlikely ' he would play on saturday			1
( from left to right ) @entity19 , @entity10 , captain @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 fancy their chances of taking down the @entity28 with the backing of a noisy @entity6 crowd @entity10 admits he is unlikely to team up with brother @entity10 in an all - sibling @entity1 doubles pairing @entity10 will face the @entity28 's @entity32 in friday 's opening singles tie in @entity6 's @entity16 @entity10 ( left ) , @entity26 ( centre ) and @entity24 speak to the media on thursday the smart money , however , would be on a clash of two siblings as the emotional centrepiece of what ought to be a fascinating three days			1
if , as expected , the match stands at 1 - 1 by friday night then gb captain @entity24 will surely opt to throw in his trump card against the world 's leading pair - however unlucky that would be for @entity19 , who has actually beaten them twice this year with @entity47 's @entity46			1
the @entity49 against the @entity50 would have so many ingredients : brothers versus brothers , @entity22 champions versus @entity22 champions , the ultimate doubles specialists versus a supreme singles player			2
@entity58 versus @entity28 ? let 's not go there			1
playing @entity15 in the @entity1 is not what it was twenty years ago , but there is still a cachet about the fixture that was the original challenge match for this competition when it was invented in 1900			1
it is mostly the homecoming of the @entity49 that will ensure that the indoor arena next door to @entity71 will be noisily packed to the rafters when the match begins			0
@entity10 , who has had a cold , on thursday declared himself fully fit			2
the doubles will see a crescendo reached , and it is notable that one of the game 's most experienced referees , @entity81 , has been allocated to the match to ensure that everything remains as orderly as possible			2
as @entity10 pointed out , the crowd will be ' full of people we 've known our whole life , a lot of familiar faces			2
' @entity9 acknowledged that part of the task for him will be to control his emotions over the three days : ' the beginning of the matches are normally where i find it would affect me most in @entity1			2
when you come out , the national anthem , the crowd getting right into it at the beginning			0
yes , it 's an emotional experience			0
and sometimes at the beginning of the matches you can be a bit fired up , amped up , whatever you want to call it			0
' that tends to subside after the first 15 or 20 minutes			0
than you just get down to trying to concentrate on the tactics , the process and trying to win the match			0
' the last time a significant @entity28 team came to these parts it was the @entity114 five months ago at @entity115			2
that ended in defeat and recrimination for the visitors , but their chances of success this time are greater and they are marginally the favourites			0
not as much as they would be in times when they could call upon the likes of their now captain , @entity132 , whose relatively shallow pool of players means this will draw scant attention back home			0
@entity10 ( right ) will kick off the tie at @entity6 's @entity16 on friday against @entity32 @entity7 ( left ) and @entity8 field questions from the press ahead of the weekend 's @entity1 action in @entity6 his biggest call has been to pick world number 47 @entity32 as his second singles player , who could find himself playing a deciding rubber against @entity145 number two @entity25 on sunday afternoon			1
@entity32 , now 25 , was once the youngest ever junior world number one and has found some good form in the past month			2
but his achievements have never matched his natural gifts and his sometimes flaky temperament will be tested as never before if he faces the lower ranked @entity25 with the match still alive			2
@entity14 's own stocks are so modest that there has been a frisson of excitement around the 27 year - old @entity159 cabbie 's son recent flirtations with the top 100			1
what he will not lack is motivation , and some of his best performances have come in the @entity1 , such as when he beat @entity15 's @entity164 last year			1
@entity25 chats with captain of the @entity167 gb @entity1 team @entity24 ahead of the @entity1 match ' the two biggest passions in my life are @entity172 and playing for my country , ' he said			1
i think you have seen that in the past and i think you will see it here			0
' he begins today by playing @entity28 number one @entity179 , who he beat in an exhibition match just prior to the @entity183			1
that is unlikely to happen again over five sets against the 6 ' 10 ' giant with a sometimes unplayable serve , but against @entity32 he would have a fighting chance			2
this tie being close presupposes that @entity26 can shake off his sometimes erratic @entity190 form and win both his singles matches			1
courier was keen to emphasise that this is not a formality : ' @entity9 ' s one of the toughest nuts in the business , he has great offensive and defensive skills , ' said @entity132			0
' that 's what 's made him such a great player , but everyone is beatable			0
if @entity9 's not sharp , he can be vulnerable and he 's had some matches this year where he has n't been as crisp as we 've seen him in @entity204			0
' as ever it is the younger @entity10 who will bear the greatest burden , with @entity145 trying to pull off its first home win at this elite level of the competition since 1986			1
so , what ’s the story with the @entity1 , then ? now heralded as the world ’s largest annual team competition , with 122 nations taking part last year , this @entity212 of men ’s tennis actually looked more like the old @entity114 when it began in 1900 — when @entity220 ’s tennis team came up with the idea of pitting the best @entity28 against the finest players from the @entity223			1
one of those students , @entity225 , bought the original trophy — hence the name			0
how does it work now ? how long have you got ? there are divisions and groups , relegation play - offs and zones			0
having expanded to six teams in 1905 , the @entity1 responded to the onset of the @entity183 era by going global in 1969			2
if you ’re in the elite top 16 , where @entity14 are now , it becomes a whole lot more simple			1
straight knock - out matches , with the winner of the final walking off with the trophy			0
and @entity14 are good , are they ? since reaching the final in 1978 , @entity145 have plummeted to some pretty low depths over the years			1
now ranked 11th , think of us as the @entity248 of tennis , yo - yoing up and down between the top division and the @entity251 1			0
how does the scoring work ? there are five matches — or rubbers — played over the course of three days , with a team point available in each rubber			0
it starts with two singles matches on the friday , there ’s a doubles rubber on the saturday , then the reverse singles on the sunday			1
it can all be over by saturday afternoon , if one team wins the first three rubbers			0
@entity145 will lean heavily on @entity26 , who may yet play in the doubles — as well as his two singles rubbers — despite not being named alongside brother @entity10 in yesterday ’s draw			1
what happens if we win this one ? a victory for @entity14 would see them progress to the @entity1 quarter - finals , to be played between july 17 - 19			1
yes , that ’s right , the same weekend as the @entity275			0
lose and it ’s a relegation play - off in september			0
how do we get tickets ? despite over 20,000 tickets selling in around 10 minutes when they were made available back in november , there are now extra places available			0
