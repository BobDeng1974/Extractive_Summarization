but the allegations from an interview with the @entity37 reveal a shocking level of misconduct			2
she began the fateful day by having lunch with @entity9 , a married father of two , at a @entity7 restaurant called the @entity43 where he spent time asking questions about her rape case			1
she was then taken to the @entity48 tourist area to meet @entity12			2
she told the @entity37 : ' looking back , it was totally naive of me to join them			1
but i was like , ' this is really cool			0
' i really looked up to them			0
' ' @entity53 was actually the one who said , ' i do n't know if you 're going to be able to come because we 're going to be drinking			0
' but when i dropped him off , the lieutenant was the one who said , ' oh , no , you should stay , come on , ' she recalled			0
' i was going through this all alone			0
my family did n't know , ' she said			0
' it felt good that they were being so nice			0
' pub : the accuser claimed @entity9 had been so drunk that servers at an @entity67 bar in downtown @entity7 refused to give him any more alcohol they then went to @entity71 's @entity70 , but @entity9 was so drunk that servers refused to give him any more alcohol			1

' he also wanted to ' feel her up			2
' she describes how he tried to work his way into her pants to tear them off but she pushed his hand away			2
the next day , both policemen visited her at @entity85 and promised to stay in touch			2
she said @entity9 called her almost daily from @entity2 for a month but the calls soon stopped , and she was ' crushed			1
' she quizzed him about why he had become distant in an e-mail but he became angry suggesting that she had screwed up his personal life			0

she told internal affairs what happened and gave them evidence , including photos from the boozy night out , text messages and phone records which showed two - hour long calls with @entity9			1

today , the woman , who is now now studying nursing at a @entity139 university , says she feels guilty that the detective might lose his job .			2

the policemen were supposed to *investigate* a separate rape allegation
the woman , from @entity7 , @entity8 , describes a boozy night out instead
she claims the @entity2 officers plied her with a rounds of drinks all night
they then took her back to the @entity16 in nearby @entity17
one officer climbed in bed with her , tried to feel her up , and kiss her
she turned him down and he later called *non-stop* for a month afterwards
