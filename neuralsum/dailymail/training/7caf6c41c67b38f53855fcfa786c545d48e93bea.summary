travelling through time may not be the far - fetched science fiction theory it was once thought to be , according to professor @entity3			1
speaking at the @entity4 , @entity3 declared to the audience : ' can you build a time machine ? the answer is yes			1
' however , the theory only works when travelling to the future , and @entity3 explained that once in the future it 's not possible to come back			1
professor @entity3 , pictured left , explained to an audience at the @entity4 that time travel is possible , based on @entity16 's @entity15			1
in theory , if technology was developed that could transport large objects close to the speed of light , humans could travel like @entity23 in his tardis , right professor @entity3 is set to give a scientific talk on the theory of time travel to mark the 50th anniversary of @entity23 in @entity30 next week			1
the talk will form part of a set of anniversary shows that will be shown before the @entity34 's @entity36 episode on 23 november			0
during his speech at the @entity39 - based science festival , @entity3 said time travel has already been done , on a very small scale			1
he added that if the technology was developed to accelerate larger objects , it could be possible for humans to travel to the future , similar to @entity23 's @entity47 in the tv show			2
yet this technology does n't exist yet , and will never exist that could take people to the past			0
@entity3 told the audience that @entity16 's @entity55 states to travel forward in time , an object needs to reach speeds close to the speed of light			1
as it approaches these speeds , time slows down but only for that specific object			1
it 's impossible to travel to the past , though , as seen in @entity62 , pictured ' you can go into the future ; you 've got almost total freedom of movement in the future , ' said @entity3			1
this means that @entity69 in @entity62 science fiction film trilogy could have travelled to 2015			0
@entity16 ’s theory of relativity was based on two principles			0
these include the principle of relativity , which states that the laws of physics do n’t change , even when objects move at constant speeds relative to each other			0
it also looked at the principle of the speed of light			2
@entity16 observed that the speed of light is the same for everyone , regardless of how their movement related to the light source			2
@entity16 's theory explains that if two objects are moving through space and want to compare what they can see , the only thing that matters and helps determine this comparison is how fast the two objects are moving relative to each other			0
the special theory specifically includes movement in a straight or uniform line at a constant speed			2
if an object starts travelling faster , curves , or veers off course , the special relatively no longer applies			0
however , he would n't have been able to return to 1985 , or travel back to 1955 like he does in the first film			2
' if you go fast , your clock runs slow relative to people who are still			0
' as you approach the speed of light , your clock runs so slow you could come back 10,000 years in the future			1
' the theory is based on @entity16 's theory of @entity118 that states to travel forward in time , an object would need to reach speeds close to the speed of light			1
as an object approach these speeds , time slows down but only for that specific object travelling			1
for example , people flying over the @entity126 will experience time passing marginally slower than people on the ground			0
' in @entity131 , you can do it in principle , ' continued @entity3			2
' it 's to do with building these things called wormholes ; shortcuts through space and time			0
but most physicists doubt it			0
' @entity141 came up with the ' chronology protection conjecture ' - physics we do n't yet understand that means wormholes are not stable			0

professor @entity3 made the claims at the @entity4
he explained time travel has already taken place , but on a very small scale
the closer someone travels to the speed of light , the more time slows
if time slows to a *significant* amount it could transport that person ' thousands of years into the future '
