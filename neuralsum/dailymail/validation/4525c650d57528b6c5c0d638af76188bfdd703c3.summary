@entity0 today refused to match @entity2 's pledge not to increase vat as a row erupted over how to balance the books after the election			1
the chancellor declined to give a ' cast - iron guarantee ' to match @entity2 's pledge not to increase vat over the five years of the next @entity9			1
it came after @entity2 's shadow chancellor @entity11 that conservatives had a history of raising vat after elections despite saying they had no plans to do so during the campaign			1
the headline rate of @entity26 stands at 20 per cent after mr @entity0 increased it from 17.5 per cent in his emergency budget in 2010			1
mr @entity11 claimed that another rise after the election on may was ' the only way the @entity23 can make their sums add up '			1
launching a new @entity2 poster , mr @entity11 said : ' we will make our tax commitments in full in our manifesto			1
but i am clear that while millionaires have been given a huge tax cut , working people are paying more in tax after the last five years of the @entity23			2
' so , today , i can announce a clear pledge to the @entity44 people			0
the next @entity2 government will not raise vat			1
and we will not extend it to food , children 's clothes , books , newspapers and public transport fares			2
' we will not raise vat because it 's the tax that hits everyone			2
it 's the tax that hits you every day			0
and it hits pensioners and the poorest hardest			0
' in the houses of @entity9 today , mr @entity0 was repeatedly challenged to match the promise but refused to do so			1
@entity2 mp @entity58 asked the chancellor four times to give a ' cast - iron guarantee ' that he would not hike the tax			1
a second @entity2 mp , @entity58 , also twice pressed the chancellor over whether @entity26 would have to rise			1
@entity2 's shadow chancellor unveiled a new poster warning ' the @entity23 will raise vat ' to help balance the books in his responses , mr @entity0 said he did not intend to increase the tax but stopped short of an actual pledge to rule it out			1
he told mr @entity58 : ' i have identified where the £ 30 billion of savings i believe need to come from and they do n't involve a vat rise			0
' the question for those who say they are going to try to balance the books but say it mainly has to be done through tax , as the official @entity80 does , has to spell out what those big tax rises are			0
' and it 's pretty clear today that they have opened to door to a big increase in @entity87 and the ` jobs tax ' and i think it would be very , very damaging for this country			0
' to mr @entity58 , the chancellor said : ' we do n't need to increase vat			2
i could n't be clearer			0
we do not need to increase vat because our plans involve saving money on the welfare budget and government departments			2
' in a jibe at mr @entity0 's former membership of an @entity102 dining club , the @entity2 mp retorted : ' your answers are more @entity105 than @entity106			1
in @entity106 , we like straight @entity107			0
' and reviving memories of mr @entity0 's ' omnishambles budget ' of 2012 , he offered the chancellor a @entity112 's pasty to give him the strength to respond more fully			1
mr @entity11 claimed the @entity23 ' have a secret plan to raise vat again ' but mr @entity0 stuck to his position : ' the policies we have do not involve a vat rise ... our proposals , our spending plans , our policies , do not involve tax rises			1
they do n't therefore involve a vat rise			0
however , your proposals do involve tax increases			0
you have been quite open about that			0
that means it is either vat or jobs tax or income tax			0
' that 's what people will get if they vote @entity2			2
but of course they wo n't vote @entity2 because they remember what you did last time			0
' mr @entity58 retorted : ' the pasty - eaters will beware again			0
' mr @entity11 , who believes @entity141 's refusal to accept his calls for a pledge not to raise vat contributed to @entity2 's defeat in 2010 , said he would ' resign rather than break this promise '			1
speaking in @entity146 - in front of a new poster featuring the letters vat as concrete blocks with the slogan ' do n't let the @entity23 hit you with this ' - mr @entity11 said the unannounced rise from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent after the 2010 election had cost families an average £ 1,800 over four years			1
it was put up ' despite @entity157 telling the @entity44 people a few days before the election that he had ' no plans ' to do so and despite the promises of @entity162 ' , he said - and had been raised by every @entity164 administration for 40 years			0
' now history is repeating itself all over again			0
it 's the same @entity23 lie about vat : 1979 , 1992 , 2010 and now 2015			1
' everybody in the country knows what it means : the @entity23 have a secret plan to raise vat again			2
' treasury figures suggested a rise to 22.5 % would cost a family with children an average of @entity177 a year and a pensioner couple @entity179 a year , he said - something a @entity2 administration would not allow			2
a @entity164 spokesman said : ' @entity183 and @entity11 have repeatedly said they will raise taxes			2
it is time that they came clean with the @entity44 public about which taxes they will raise - income tax or national insurance ? ' the choice at this election is becoming clearer by the day : sticking with the competence of the @entity164 ' long - term economic plan that 's securing a better future for @entity44 or abandoning that plan with hard - working taxpayers paying the price for the economic chaos that would result from @entity183 in @entity202			0
' @entity203 chief secretary to the treasury @entity204 said : ' @entity2 have no credibility on the economy			0
@entity11 might be ruling out a rise in vat but he ca n't rule out a rise in @entity87 and already plans to hike corporation tax			1
' because the @entity203 have taken the difficult decisions to stick to a balanced recovery , under our future plans there is no need to raise income tax , @entity87 , vat or corporation tax			0

@entity2 's @entity11 unveils poster warning @entity23 will hike vat again
@entity0 used first @entity222 in 2010 to increase rate from 17.5 % to 20 %
chancellor *insists* his plans to balance books do not require new increase
but he repeatedly refused to match @entity2 's promise ahead of election
