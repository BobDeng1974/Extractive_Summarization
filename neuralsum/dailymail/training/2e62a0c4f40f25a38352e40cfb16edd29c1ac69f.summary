a beautiful spring monday morning			2
the @entity1 glistened in the sunlight			2
@entity3 filled the air , blossom falling from trees and a feeling of hope among all those lucky enough to be outdoors on that glorious day			2
around a hundred members of the local @entity11 were enjoying the day as they ’d planned a march across the bridge			1
as they strolled along , they took in those beautiful sights and sounds			2
the sun ’s rays bouncing off the river			2
the larks whistling to one another			2
and myself and @entity22 rolling around on the grass , yelling and throwing punches at each other			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity27 reveal some of his greatest pranks and wind - ups fighter : @entity27 tells all about how he once came to blows with @entity32 team - mate @entity22 tension : the duo played together on @entity35 between 2009 - 11 funny man : former @entity37 midfielder @entity27 tells it like it is in his new book bend it like @entity27 that was probably the most ridiculous situation i ’ve ever been in as a footballer , and i say that having had my head shut in a door by @entity48			1
if you ’re ever going to have a fight with someone , i would highly recommend not doing it in front of a hundred pensioners			1
@entity55 was brilliant at bringing us all together at @entity57 and was never shy with his generosity			2
after one season , we were sitting in the dressing room , and he walked in with a huge leather sports bag			2
‘ @entity62 , boys , listen up , ’ he said			2
‘ you ’ve achieved what we wanted to achieve so share this between you			2
’ and as he ended his sentence , he slid the bag across the floor and walked out			2
we all looked at each other , thinking the same thing - there must be cash in the bag			1
our skipper @entity75 opened up the hold - all , peeped inside it , then looked up with a smile on his face			1
‘ it ’s cash , boys ! ’ there must have been about £ 250,000 in there , which we all received a cut of in our next pay packet			2
i was absolutely furious with @entity22 , and the scrap just happened to take place in the car park by the @entity1 because the gaffer had decided that ’s where we were going to have our warm - down that morning			1
it was the day after we ’d been hammered by @entity96 live on telly in my first game back after my third knee injury			1
not the ideal return , especially when you consider i had also had a stand - up row with @entity22 in the dressing room at half - time			1
and , as is always the case with these football flashpoints , it had started over something so stupid			2
we went a goal down after @entity110 had run unchallenged on to a deep , back - post cross			1
@entity22 was supposed to have picked him up , but was yards behind when @entity110 volleyed in			1
@entity22 was normally a fantastic presence at the back post , very good in the air and always covered danger thanks to his good positional sense			1
but , for whatever reason , he ’d gone awol			0
not a disaster as there were only 17 minutes gone			0
during a break in play , i ran past @entity22 and said : ‘ i thought you were comfortable at the back post there , @entity22 ? ’ ‘ f * * * ing comfortable ! ’ came his angry reply			1
‘ you f * * * ing cheeky b * * * * * * ! ’ whoah ! i really had n’t meant that much by the comment , other than expressing my disappointment because he was usually so good			0
he obviously felt like i was digging him out , but that ’s football and these things happen			0
i attempted to defuse the situation : ‘ hang on a minute , all i said was that i thought you were comfortable on the back stick			0
we ’re still in the game , it does n’t matter			0
’ but he was still muttering away at me , and clearly not in a complimentary way			0
we came in at half - time 2 - 1 down , still in the game , but @entity22 was n’t interested in that			1
stalwart : @entity22 made 180 league appearances for @entity32 , before also going on to manage the club joker : @entity27 leading @entity32 's famous celebration after scoring against @entity152 @entity153 was a young player at @entity37			1
one morning he came in for training in a new @entity155 convertible			0
once he ’d cleared off , i grabbed a huge wheelie bin , filled it with water and poured it into his car			0
which was quite funny , but not as funny as two wheelie bins full of water in it			0
alas , there was @entity166			0
after training , @entity153 and the boys gathered round a screen in the club office to see footage of me pouring water into his car			2
‘ was that you in the car park , @entity176 ? ’ someone asked			0
‘ @entity179 , no. ’ luckily , the warm weather dried the car out			0
he was waiting for me and , in front of the whole team and management , he lost the plot and crossed a line			1
instead of sticking to what happened on the pitch , he brought money — specifically my @entity32 contract — into it			1
‘ this club paid £ 5million for you and pays you £ 45,000 a week , ’ he was ranting , as if to say i needed to be doing more to justify my wages			2
how on earth had he gone from being p * * * * d off about me having a go at him on the pitch to talking about my contract ? i was more aware than anyone of how much i owed the club , seeing as i was playing only my seventh game for @entity32 in more than a year , because of two serious knee injuries			1
but i certainly did n’t need him discussing my personal business in the middle of the dressing room at half - time			1
i was raging inside and i could see some of the other boys were shaking their heads implying that @entity22 was out of order but what i did n’t get , and still do n’t to this day , is why ( manager ) @entity213 or any of the management team never got involved			1
‘ do n’t worry , ’ i said , fuming			0
‘ you ’ve obviously got a bee in your bonnet about me			0
it ’s not about money			0
we ’ve let a goal in and now you ’re digging out my contract			0
we ’ll sort it out tomorrow			0
’ ‘ anytime , anywhere , ’ was his reply as we all stormed back out on the pitch to concede three more goals and get pasted			0
prone : @entity27 suffered from bad injury problems during his time at @entity32 mediator : @entity213 brought @entity27 to @entity35 for £ 5million there must ’ve been at least a dozen cameras as i sat there at @entity235			1
after what felt like forever , @entity236 introduced us to the press			0
‘ afternoon , thanks for coming			0
i ’m pleased to be able to present our new signings			0
we have @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and , er			0
what ’s your name ? ’ i was utterly devastated			0
but it came to him : ‘ er , @entity176			0
’ the world knew my name			0
all i had to do was get on the pitch ; that proved to be a lot harder than i thought			0
that night , i could n’t sleep a wink			0
i wanted to kill @entity22 and that ’s all i could think about			1
the gaffer had decided we ’d have our warm - down session out by the @entity1 , rather than pore over hours of video analysis			2
we ’d been there before , it ’s a mile - and - a - half each way during which we ’d do walking and jogging , then back to the club for ice baths and massages			1
i would certainly need cooling down when we got back			0
i travelled to the bridge in my team - mate @entity275 ’s car and he sensed something was up			1
but i barely noticed because i was focused on @entity22			1
@entity275 parked and , as we got out , i spotted my nemesis and the red mist descended			0
‘ come here you , ’ i said			0
‘ we ’ve got to have a word , have n’t we ? ’ as @entity22 walked towards me , i reached out to grab him and he threw a punch at my head straight away			1
within seconds we were having a proper ding - dong , rolling around on the ground , trying to belt the c * * * out of each other			2
we were both throwing punches , but none really seemed to land			1
i was so full of anger and adrenaline that i probably would n’t have felt it if @entity22 had landed one in any case			1
jumping for joy : @entity27 celebrates scoring a penalty against @entity298 for @entity32 fresh start : @entity27 worked as a pundit for @entity301 at the @entity303 final between @entity298 and @entity32 on saturday i ’d love to be able to say that i sorted him out , but the truth is that it was little more than explosive grappling for a few seconds			1
as the gaffer said later , it was hardly @entity308			0
we both ended up lying on a bush with no real leverage to get out of it so loads of the boys dived in to split us up			0
@entity315 , the assistant manager , walked me down the path , while the rest took @entity22 and headed in the opposite direction			1
except nobody realised that this particular path followed a circular route , meaning that after a few minutes we all met up again			0
as soon as i saw @entity22 again , i launched myself at him			1
this time , he was protected by @entity322 and @entity323 , like two blocks of flats			2
i just bounced off them and had to call it a day			0
just when it seemed like things could n’t have got any worse , the gaffer started receiving complaints from members of the @entity11			1
they had called into the club and the local radio station , appalled by what they ’d seen - and i do n’t mean our wild ( and wildly ineffective ) fighting styles , which they would have had every right to criticise			1
@entity342 it like bullard by @entity27 is published by @entity345 at £ 16.99			1

@entity27 came to blows with @entity22 after @entity96 defeat in 2010
the pair were team - mates together at @entity32 for over two years
had to be separated after throwing punches in front of @entity11
@entity27 struggled badly with injury during his time at the club
