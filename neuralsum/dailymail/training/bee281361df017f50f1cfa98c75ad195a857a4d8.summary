for just a moment there , followers of the @entity2 game wore a worried countenance			1
for much of 2014 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 were sliding alarmingly down the world rankings and there were few signs of players of similar calibre ready to step forward to take their place			2
was the @entity2 game regressing towards the darkness endured at the start of this millennium , when @entity19 marched a lonely stride among the world ’s top 100 ? @entity23 beat former masters champion @entity24 in sudden death to win the @entity26 now , a new year begins with no such anxieties			1
not only is there every hope the aforementioned trio will enjoy a revival , there have been pleasing scenes coming out of @entity34 regarding the next wave			2
it was encouraging enough when @entity38 @entity37 managed to hold off the silken swings of the @entity34 to win the @entity40 before @entity41			1
then , on sunday , @entity42 @entity23 beat former masters champion @entity24 in sudden death to become only the second @entity2 after @entity44 in 1970 to win the @entity26 — after @entity45 , the oldest trophy in the game			1
the scale of these triumphs should not be underplayed			2
ok , many of the world ’s best were not there , but @entity34 has so many proven winners who are particularly effective on home soil			2
this was a spectacular double for the @entity57 ( @entity23 ) and the @entity58 ( @entity37 )			1
@entity23 become only the second @entity2 after @entity44 in 1970 to claim golf 's oldest trophy @entity23 earned his moniker following a hole - in - one last year with its unique prize of a trip into space , while @entity37 will probably never be able to escape reference to the @entity69 classic given his father is a @entity72 vicar			1
completing a quartet of rich , regional accents is the personable 23 - year - old @entity76 @entity75 and @entity77 from @entity78			2
@entity79 begins the three - tournament @entity80 in the @entity82 this week , knowing that if he can clamber into the world ’s top 50 — he is currently 52nd — by the end of march , he will join @entity37 at the masters in april			1
@entity37 celebrates victory at the @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity34 former @entity91 , fresh from earning his tour card at the age of just 20 , finished in the top five in his first event , the @entity26			1
then from the @entity34 , there ’s @entity97 from @entity98 and @entity99 from @entity100 , who are both more than capable of achieving their first wins this year			0
plenty of positive vibes for the @entity2 game , therefore , at the start of another campaign			1
quote of the week ‘ @entity108 would not be dying if more people played the way we play out here			0
we ’ve just taken two - and - a - half hours , including a 19th hole to settle a tied score			0
it ’s not that hard to do			0
’ as one keen golfer sets out on the last few holes of his term as @entity120 president , another @entity121 wannabe @entity119 — son of one former incumbent and brother of another — declares how he likes to play the game			0
we might not come close to agreement on anything else he believes in , but i think we can surely give him a round of applause on this one			0
@entity134 set to make his first appearance at the @entity136 since 2001 by the time he gets to @entity138 , there will , assuredly , be pandemonium			1
as if the last weekend in january was n't busy enough for @entity140 ’s largest city , with the @entity141 coming to town and the @entity136 , which regularly attracts the largest , booziest crowd in the sport — always more than 500,000 spectators for the week — also taking place			1
now , @entity134 has announced he will begin his season with a first appearance in the @entity136 since 2001			1
i do n’t know who was first to cast eyes on the raucous hordes and wittily proclaim it would be better known as the @entity153			0
but i 've a feeling it might apply more than ever this year			0
will @entity156 fall in on @entity45 ? ever since the subject was first raised in these pages three years ago , the possibility of the @entity158 losing @entity45 to @entity156 following nearly 60 years of coverage has rumbled menacingly beneath the surface			0
the corporation ’s plight was not helped when the @entity165 and @entity167 ’s @entity120 equivalent , the @entity168 , signed away the rights to the @entity170 to brash newcomer @entity171 , after decades on @entity173			0
@entity174 with the @entity175 after winning the @entity26 at @entity176 in 2014 now the tendering process is under way , will the @entity180 cash in as well ? given their mandate is to look after the best interests of the game , it is to be hoped not			2
how can it help golf to take live coverage of its most prestigious competition off terrestrial television , thereby cutting its viewing figures by three - quarters and depriving curious youngsters of a vital opportunity to watch ? against that , the @entity158 are said to be disillusioned			0
the contract ends next year , and right now it is not easy to see how this is going to end well for the @entity180 game .			0

@entity202 @entity23 become only the second @entity2 after @entity44 in 1970 to win the @entity26
@entity38 @entity37 won the @entity40 before @entity41
@entity134 set to make his first appearance at the @entity136 since 2001
