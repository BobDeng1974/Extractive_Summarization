by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 1 may 2013 stylishly single : @entity1 chose not to wear a summer dress because it was ' freezing ' a casting agent for @entity5 has opened up about how her date , a 49 - year - old @entity8 lawyer , told her that she was n't showing enough skin			1
he said ' you should have worn a skirt , ' she writes on her blog @entity14			2
' this was n't meant as a joke			0
he continued to complain about my lack of skin until we left the restaurant			0
' according to her date , wearing a short skirt was ' the only way to tell the guy is a " @entity31 " ' because ' if he can keep his cool while you 're sitting there flaunting your goods , he 's a real man			0
' @entity1 ' story should be viewed as a cautionary tale about how differently men and women view first date attire			1
like @entity1 , many women go into dates with a feeling of being ' helpless and desperate to please			1
' this is why we change outfits six times to unearth the ideal combination classy and sexy			0
but for most men , the only accessories that matter are cleavage and a smile			0
working in fashion presents @entity1 with an additional set of challenges : ' i 'm not used to dressing for straight men , ' she explains			1
' everyone 's either gay or a woman			0
and the rare straight man who does loiter around in the colorful corridors of the fashion industry chases models for sport			0
so i dress for myself and other girls			2
' we have our go - to body armor - mine is a @entity67 dress that is long enough for work but shows cleavage with my jacket off			1
but as a freelance writer , my outfits often depend on my assignments			2
after writing an article on the super-short skirt trend , i showed up to my date straight from the photo shoot in a neon yellow @entity79 micro mini with five - inch heels - only to have my date joke that i looked ' like @entity83 '			1
another guy told me me point - blank that he ' hated ' the large bow on my blouse , and a third called my @entity88 purple ankle boots ' an abortion '			1
stepping out : casting agent and fashion blogger @entity1 says that she feels ' helpless and desperate to please ' when deciding what to wear on a first date @entity1 was wearing ' a tiny @entity94 shirt that bared my arms and shoulders quite generously ' adding , ' really is n’t that the only thing you can see when you ’re across from someone at a table ? ' unfairly judged : @entity0 ( pictured with her husband ) wore a neon yellow mini skirt on a date - and the guy joked she looked ' like @entity83 ' she adds that she was ' freezing ' , so wearing a skirt was n't very practical			1
fashion magazines do n't usually cover ' stilettos that wo n't get stuck in subway escalators ' or ' slits that wo n't fly up to expose your underwear to construction workers			0
' still she wondered if she made the right call			0
' was i wrong to wear pants ? was i wrong to assume i would come off as slutty or too eager if i wore a short skirt ? ' she asks			2
her date , who argued that ' 99per cent of men would say they prefer a skirt over pants ' would say yes			0
to investigate , @entity1 ' stopped a few guys around the @entity124 and asked them if it was suitable for a first date , or if they would have preferred to see a skirt instead			1
' among this ( perhaps slightly biased ) demographic , she says ' the answers were all in my favor			0
' sometimes , however , men are being self - conscious rather than sexist			2
a lot of guys , especaily those who work in competitive industries , are used to teasing their friends and may be cracking a joke to break the ice			0
my husband asked me ' have you ever considered getting breast implants ? ' on one of our very first dates			1
the right to bare arms : for her date @entity1 chose a tiny @entity94 shirt instead of taking it personally , i smiled and said ' have you ever considered getting a penis implant ? ' he never brought it up again .			1
