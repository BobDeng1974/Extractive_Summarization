@entity0 , 38 , from @entity1 won @entity2 last friday wannabe chefs with their eye on a career as the next @entity6 or @entity7 should take note - it does n't have to cost a fortune			1
the new winner of @entity11 , who won the title last friday , has n't been on a single cookery course or even had one lesson			1
everything the 38 year old knows about cooking is self - taught - learnt form reading recipe books or watching television shows			1
he told @entity21 : ' it ’s all self - taught			1
there ’s no more to it than that			2
you can achieve anything if you try hard enough and you ’re passionate enough			2
' i learnt what i know from reading , websites like @entity31 , watching tv and talking to people who are also passionate about it			2
' i also found out a lot from watching chefs when i go to a restaurant - you go into a lot of restaurants these days and you can see straight into the kitchen			1
' i ca n’t help it , it ’s like watching tv and if it ’s happening in front of you , you ca n’t help but watch what they do			2
' while @entity0 , who lives in @entity1 , learns about his cooking from reading and watching programmes , he sharpens his skills by practicing on his four children - @entity51 , 20 , @entity52 , 18 , @entity53 , 16 , and @entity54 , seven			1
the lucky children are often on the receiving end of their father 's culinary masterpieces - in the @entity0 household lunchboxes can become works of art. he said : ' they only get fancy stuff in their lunch boxes when i ’m practising			1
' all of my kids like different things , so it can be like a gourmet buffet sometimes when you ’re at my house			1
' everyone wants something different , someone wants fish , and someone else wants shellfish - if it ’s in the fridge or freezer it ’s likely to come out at some point or another			1
' they ’re not fussy at all though			2
they ’re like me , there ’s nothing i do n’t like and that has carried on through to them too			0
it makes life a lot easier			0
but he gave up his dream because he and his wife , who he separated from two years ago , had a child very young			0
the couple met while working at @entity100 and when he was just 19 , they had their first child - @entity51			1
@entity0 as an eight year old after winning the chance to spend a day in a hotel kitchen the hours that chefs do are notoriously antisocial and so @entity0 decided to take up a career in it instead			1
his children are over the moon that their father is now following his dream though and they watched the @entity2 final on tv together last friday , when they learnt for the first time that their father had won - because it had to be kept a secret until the programme aired			1
he said : ' when we watched it together , it was the first time that they found out i had won and it was emotional , it was pretty overwhelming			1
' it was a moment in all of our lives that we ’ll remember and will treasure and look back on			0
' @entity0 has come a long way since the beginning of the show - in the first episode he was so terrified that @entity130 , who is one of the judges on the show , pointed out that he was actually ' shaking in his trainers '			1
@entity0 said : ' when you first go in there on day one , when you see @entity137 and @entity130 for the first time , they ’re practically idols of yours and you ’ve not met them before that			1
' then it all starts to get very real very quickly			0
it ’s a daunting prospect that ’s in front of you			0
' so the next hour and 15 minutes that you get in there can determine the rest of your life really			0
' but @entity0 managed to overcome his nerves and was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show			1
he won the final with a starter of octopus , with chorizo crisps and a cannellini bean and chorizo salad ; his main course was pigeon with carrots , pommes parisienne and a cassis jus ; and for the pudding he produced a lemon posset , with citrus tutti - frutti			1
@entity0 was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show he said : ' you grow so quickly when you ’re down there			1
you get feedback from people that you ’d never normally meet and they ’re so good at what they do - everyone down there is			2
' i got loads of really good feedback down there			0
i had a really good competition when i found my confidence and got rid of my nerves – i think it showed as well			0
' for anyone looking to follow @entity0 's success , he has one simple tip - enjoy it			1
he said : ' if you do n’t enjoy it , it shows in the food that you have n’t made something you believe in or enjoyed making			0
that comes out on the plate and ultimately for your guests or whoever is eating the meal and that ’s no good because food is about passion and giving people a valuable experience			0
' if you do n’t enjoy it i do n’t think your guests will either			0
' @entity0 has n't always been this good , even @entity2 winner 's have the occasional cooking disaster			1
as a young man , he learnt the hazards of absent - minded cooking after he tipped and entire stock he had worked on for hours down the sink			1
he said : ' my biggest disaster was when i was younger and first started out cooking , i did @entity219 dinner for the first time			2
' i had a big turkey carcass so thought i was going to make a really nice stock			0
' i simmered it for hours and hours and made a really good stock			0
' then i went to drain all of the vegetables and the bones out and ended up pouring it all down the sink because i did n’t put something under it , that was a lesson i learnt really early on – think about what you ’re doing			0
' i do n’t think there is anything i ca n’t cook though			0
i think i ’ve shown throughout the competition that i ’m good with most things that get thrown at me			0
' @entity0 is now hoping to open a restaurant of his own while he enjoys fancy cooking , one of the simplest culinary pleasures for @entity0 is a meal that can be rustled up in under ten minutes - a plain omelette			1
he said : ' the first thing i ever cooked as a child was an omelette			2
' and if i 'm looking for something quick and easy to do , i still always go back to an omelette and a glass of wine , with a salad			2
' nothing in it , just some sea salt and a really good salad with it , that ’s it – done			0
' just nice and simple , good eggs , good omelette			2
' but anyone looking to sample some of the cooking that netted @entity0 the @entity2 prize can expect something much more intricate when he succeeds in his dream of opening his own restaurant			1
for the time being he is going back to the it company he worked for , but his eye is already on setting up his own eaterie			0
he said : ' i am definitely planning on having a restaurant eventually – it ’s every cook or chef ’s dream			2
' if you can make money doing something you love and enjoy it and help people create memories then that is amazing			0
' i think a lot of people remember where they were when they had a good meal with special people at special times - if you can get involved with that by having a restaurant , it ’s really good			2
' i think i ’d want to do classic dishes with a modern twist			0
' something that looks nice , is achievable			0
but is also quite opulent and refined and nice			0
' also something that is n’t out of everybody ’s reach			0
