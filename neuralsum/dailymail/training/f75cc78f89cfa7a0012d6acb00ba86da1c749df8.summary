motorists could be forced to pay to drive ‘ by the kilometre ’ on @entity2 roads under plans being drawn up by bureaucrats in @entity5			1
@entity7 transport commissioner @entity6 said she was working on plans for an @entity7 - wide road toll scheme in order to standardise charges across the continent			1
the scheme would require every car to be fitted with an electronic device containing a satellite receiver that would record the distance travelled and bill the motorist accordingly			1
motorists could be forced to pay to drive ‘ by the kilometre ’ on @entity2 roads under plans being drawn up by bureaucrats in @entity5 miss @entity6 said the scheme could be made ‘ obligatory ’ across the @entity7			1
the idea last night provoked an angry reaction in @entity25 , where ministers insisted there were no plans to introduce a national road toll scheme in @entity2			1
the last proposal for a national ‘ road pricing ’ scheme was abandoned by @entity33 in 2007 in the face of overwhelming public opposition			2
a senior @entity37 source said : ‘ there are no plans for road tolls in the @entity2 , whatever this @entity7 bureaucrat might say			1
it is hard to see any @entity2 driver welcoming this bonkers idea and if they want a referendum on our relationship with the @entity7 they need to vote for a @entity37 government			1
’ @entity51 , campaign director at the campaign group @entity52 , said new road tolls would cripple @entity2 motorists			0
mr @entity51 said : ‘ motorists and firms already pay enough to use the roads , without @entity7 tolls adding to that burden			1
it 's ludicrous that the @entity7 would even consider hitting hard - pressed drivers with further charges			2
it appears some in the commission just do n't understand that decisions like these should be taken in the @entity2 , not @entity5			2
’ @entity7 transport commissioner @entity6 said she was working on plans for an @entity7 - wide road toll scheme but miss @entity6 insisted the time had come to consider the introduction of a common road pricing scheme operating across the @entity7			1
she said there were many different systems in @entity73 at the moment and claimed this was a burden on car drivers and an obstacle to their mobility			0
she told the @entity81 newspaper @entity80 that it made sense to work on a @entity73 system for lorries and cars that could regulate road charges in a uniform manner for all @entity7 countries			2
‘ the amount of the fee should , in my opinion , be exclusively based on the number of kilometres actually driven and should not be time - dependent , ’ she said			0
‘ it does n't matter where you come from - everyone will only pay for the distance they have actually driven and it will be billed on a device throughout @entity73			2
we 're currently investigating just such an idea			0
’ miss @entity6 said no decision had yet been made on whether countries like @entity2 would be allowed to seek an opt - out from the new regime			0
she said : ‘ there are many options - a fee could be obligatory but it 's also possible to make it optional i.e. that countries decide themselves whether and on which roads they want to levy a road use charge based on kilometres driven			0
’ the last @entity33 government spent years trying to introduce a national road pricing scheme in @entity2			0
it was finally abandoned in 2007 after 1.8 million people signed a petition against it			0
many motorists feared the charges would just be a new tax on top of road tax and fuel duty			0
as a result , the @entity2 still has only a relatively small number of toll roads and road pricing schemes .			0
