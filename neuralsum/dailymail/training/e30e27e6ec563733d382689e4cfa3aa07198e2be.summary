@entity0 showed little mercy to former club @entity2 as he grabbed @entity5 ' second goal in the 3 - 0 @entity7 win which eased the @entity8 into the @entity9 last 16			1
the former @entity11 striker was left on the bench by boss @entity13 but netted just 90 seconds after coming on as a second - half substitute			2
@entity15 had given the @entity17 side a 19th - minute lead with his deflected opener and swept home another with a fine finish six minutes from time			1
@entity15 , assisted by @entity22 , opened the scoring in the 19th minute with a shot from outside the box @entity15 's @entity5 team - mates celebrate with him after his first - half goal at @entity7 the @entity5 players congratulate @entity0 after he doubled @entity5 ' lead in the second half law adds his second , and @entity5 ' third , goal of the game to send them through to the quarter - finals it was a welcome win - their third victory over top - flight opposition this season - for under - pressure boss @entity13 after last week 's defeat to promotion rivals @entity40			1
and it was also a good day for @entity0			1
he returned to @entity7 in the summer after a 22 - goal stint with @entity2 last season but has struggled to repeat the lethal form of his record - breaking first spell with the club			1
but he wasted no time in punishing a mistake by best friend @entity47 in the @entity50 side 's goal with the crucial second as the visitors slumped to their fifth straight defeat			0
@entity2 's last visit to @entity7 was six days after the club was plunged into administration in february 2012			1
since then the @entity8 faithful have endured a living nightmare that shows no sign of relenting			0
last week 's 2 - 0 defeat at @entity60 leaves them nine points adrift in the race for automatic promotion back to the @entity65 , while their off - field woes continue to roll on with this week 's news that the club lost another Â£ 8.3million in the year up to june 30			0
the home fans once again showed their frustrations by staying away in their droves , leaving a meagre crowd of just 14,412 to watch the action			0
early sniffs at goal from @entity5 ' @entity74 and the visitors ' @entity75 offered hope of an open affair			1
but it was not until the 15th minute that a genuine attempt on target was registered			2
@entity2 defender @entity82 attempts to tackle @entity5 ' @entity83 on sunday @entity83 has an acrobatic effort on the @entity2 goal in the second half of the fourth - round clash @entity2 manager @entity88 and his opposite number @entity13 on the touchline at @entity7 striker @entity91 , who is enjoying his third spell at @entity5 , tries to hold off @entity93 defender @entity94 dived in on @entity95 down on the right touchline but the @entity2 winger skipped past the challenge before pulling the ball back for @entity100			1
the @entity103 playmaker 's shot did not look threatening until it skipped off @entity105 's boot and squirmed a fraction wide with @entity107 wrong - footed			0
but it was @entity5 who got the breakthrough			1
@entity111 launched a long throw into the box which @entity2 failed to clear further than @entity22 on the edge of the box			1
the @entity117 winger had to shove referee @entity118 out the way before stabbing the ball back to @entity15 , who saw his right - foot sweep deflect off @entity123 's brow on its way into the top corner			1
the goal sparked @entity5 into a sudden burst of industry			2
@entity74 stung the hands of @entity47 with a 25 - yard strike while @entity91 claimed for a penalty after @entity132 slid in on him just as he was about to pull the trigger			0
the right - back came from the wrong side but @entity118 correctly judged that he took the ball			0
@entity83 heads the ball during the second half at @entity7 while @entity139 watches on @entity5 and @entity2 playing at @entity7 in their @entity9 fourth round clash on sunday @entity2 striker @entity141 holds off @entity5 defender @entity142 in the @entity9 clash @entity47 then tipped away @entity145 's grass - cutter while @entity123 's under - cooked header back to the keeper almost put @entity91 in , but @entity2 made it to the break without any further losses			1
@entity88 's team were livelier after the break , with @entity153 giving @entity111 problems down the left			0
but @entity5 should have put daylight between the teams on 58 minutes			2
@entity158 danced past @entity139 before whipping a cross to @entity74 at the back post , but the @entity11 under - 21 cap ballooned his shot high into the @entity163 stand			0
@entity83 found himself through on goal with 25 minutes left but pace was never one of the @entity168 's strongest attributes			0
his decision to play in partner @entity91 - rather than press forward himself - drew a huge groan from the crowd , especially when his pass failed to find its target			0
the former @entity176 frontman could have little complaint when he was replaced soon after by @entity0 - who rubbed his team - mate 's nose in it by taking just 90 seconds to make his mark			2
@entity22 's corner was met by @entity105 but @entity47 should have gathered it			0
his spill though fell straight at the feet of former @entity50 colleague @entity0 , who showed little sympathy by ramming the ball home at the near post			2
law then put the seal on the win as he collected @entity193 's pass from the left before curling a delicious finish past the helpless @entity47 .			0

@entity5 beat @entity2 in the fourth round of the @entity9
@entity15 opened the scoring for @entity5 in the 19th minute
@entity0 doubled @entity5 ' lead *mid* way through the second half
law got his second , and @entity5 ' third late in the game
