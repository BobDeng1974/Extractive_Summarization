by @entity0 published : 20:29 est , 7 november 2013 @entity2 : 02:33 est , 8 november 2013 only one in every 67 reports of illegal immigration result in a person being booted out of the country , a damning report by @entity4 reveals today			1
incredibly , in 94 out of every 100 cases , immigration officials are not even bothering to properly follow - up on tip offs from concerned members of the public			1
this is despite @entity17 personally urging people to ‘ report suspected illegal immigrants ’ a to new @entity22 database so they could be deported			1
@entity24 and @entity22 officials evict @entity26 immigrants from a derelict site in @entity28			1
despite raids such as this a report has found that just one in every 67 reports of illegal immigration result in a person being deported @entity4 say that , as a result of the inaction by officials , people will lose confidence and could soon stop bothering to ring the authorities to report illegal working or visa over-stayers			1
the revelations are contained in yet another critical report on the @entity46 ’s border controls by @entity48 ’s home affairs select committee			2
the report revealed that between its introduction on september 30 last year and june 30 this year , the illegal immigrant database received 48,660 allegations - about 178 a day			1
but , in the eight months to may this year , allegations resulted in only 2,695 investigations with visits by @entity57 officers , 1,840 arrests and 660 removals			1
mps said this was the equivalent of only around 6 per cent of claims leading to an investigation and 1.5 per cent to removals			0
home affairs select committee chairman @entity66 said there was a backlog of more than 430,000 @entity22 cases the study also said the @entity72 had a backlog of 432,029 immigration and asylum cases when it was scrapped at the end of march - which at current levels will take five years to clear			1
after a raft of damning reports , home secretary @entity79 abolished the @entity72 earlier this year , and replaced it with @entity82 and an @entity57 command , under the direct control of ministers			0
committee chairman @entity66 said : ‘ there are still over 430,000 cases languishing in the backlogs , enough to fill @entity89 almost five times over			1
‘ as we have said on numerous occasions , the backlogs must be cleared as a matter of priority			0
only then will the @entity96 be able to tackle the deeper problems in the immigration system			0
’ the committee also took aim at the government 's recent efforts to reduce @entity46 's ' pull factor ' for immigrants by introducing charges for access to the @entity107			0
under the proposals , temporary migrants from outside the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) , including those on a route to settlement in the @entity46 , will face a healthcare surcharge of around £ 150 per year for students and around £ 200 per year for others			0
the @entity4 claimed it could unfairly hit victims of people trafficking and said a fairer scheme would be to force visa applicants to take out private health insurance			1
the committee backed the @entity96 's policy of trying to persuade illegal immigrants to go home voluntarily , with government support			1
mps agreed this was cheaper than forced removals , which cost around £ 11,000 each			0
but they joined attacks on the so - called ' racist van ' , which toured @entity28 advising illegals to ' go home ' or face arrest			0
the vans were scrapped by mrs may last month after proving ineffective			0
protestors demonstrating against @entity72 fishing raids in @entity140 , @entity28 , last month the report said : ' tough enforcement action should be taken against those who are determined to remain here illegally , but for the target audience of potential voluntary returners , the effectiveness of the carrot is potentially undermined by the ostentatious brandishing of the stick			0
' mr @entity66 said : ‘ if the government wants to get tough on illegal immigrants it needs to take effective action			2
when people make allegations about those here illegally the @entity96 must act			1
‘ currently only six in 100 reports of illegal immigrants result in an actual investigation and only 1.5 in 100 result in removal			2
this is a very poor record and does not give confidence to those who go out of their way to help the @entity96			2
’ mr @entity66 lamented the ' chaotic summer for immigration policy ' , citing the controversial ' go home ' vans , allegations that @entity173 asked @entity46 citizens to leave their own country , @entity167 being used to publicise raids and the u-turn on visa bonds			2
immigration minister @entity179 said : ' the @entity72 was a troubled organisation since its formation in 2008 and its performance was not good enough			0
that is why we split the @entity22 and brought its work into the @entity96 under two distinct directorates			1
' we have already made some progress and it is welcome that the backlog according to the @entity189 has been reduced by 70,400 or 14 per cent in the quarter			0
our newly created @entity46 @entity192 and @entity57 directorate is focused on delivering a high - volume , high - quality visa service while @entity57 is getting tough on those who break our immigration laws			0
' we are building an immigration system that the public can have confidence in			2
we have already reformed the immigration rules and net migration is down by a third since its peak in 2010			0

@entity4 warn people will lose confidence and stop reporting illegal working
@entity22 has a back log of more than 430,000 cases
illegal immigrant database receives 178 allegations per day
