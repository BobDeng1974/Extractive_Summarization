from uncle @entity5 , a sporting role model if ever there was , to his parents and his own wife and kids , the boy from @entity3 is surrounded by people who love and support him			2
when he makes his @entity10 bow at @entity11 next week , then , he ’ll be thinking of the entire clan			1
among them grandmother @entity13 , who passed away within days of @entity1 being named as one of @entity18 captain ’s wildcard selections			1
‘ she knew i was in the team and was proud of me , ’ he said : ‘ now i ’ll do her proud			2
it puts things into perspective			2
family are more important than anything and things like that happening certainly keep you grounded			2
@entity1 wants to perform at home @entity10 for his grandmother @entity13 , who recent passed away big decision : @entity33 captain @entity32 announces his wildcards to face the @entity35 , including @entity1 ‘ i went from the highest of the highs to the lowest of the lows in a day			1
i ’d just got into the team when i heard my gran , who had gone in for a routine operation , was getting kept in - then ultimately passed away on the sunday			1
‘ but @entity5 was up and the family were all at her bedside			0
it was a tough time , no doubt , but that ’s life			2
’ @entity1 is away from home this week , playing in the @entity48 as a warm - up to the main event on a track he knows better than just about anyone on the @entity54 ; seven top - 10 finishes on the @entity56 suggest a certain affinity with a venue he ’s been visiting since he was a nipper			1
still , practice rounds there last week came as something as a shock – illustrating to @entity1 just how enormous next week will be			1
how will the rookie , nephew of former @entity10 player and captain @entity5 , cope with it all ? firstly , by talking to those who have been through it all before			1
‘ we are meeting @entity32 tonight then i will go for dinner with @entity71 tomorrow night , ’ said @entity1 , who tees off in the @entity48 on thursday			1
chasing : scot @entity72 is one round away in @entity74 from displacing @entity75 but needs a top - two finish ‘ we also have a mega-experienced backroom staff , while i ’ve spoken to my uncle a couple of times as well - and they are all saying pretty much the same thing			1
they ’ve said that i should go and enjoy it			0
‘ as for the first tee in a @entity10 , you ca n’t replicate that anywhere			1
can it be any more nervous than holing a putt for a birdie or eagle to win a tournament or get into a play - off ? ‘ nervousness or excitement is only really how much pressure you put on yourself			1
i do n’t get up and down much but i feel both nervous and excited , excited more than anything , when i play normal events			0
‘ the reaction to me getting in the team has been more than i expected , to be honest			0
i do n’t know if it ’s down to me being the only @entity72 in the team or that it ’s more than 40 years since a @entity10 was played here			1
it ’s a bigger animal now			0
@entity1 has had seven top - 10 finishes at @entity11 and used to play the course when he was a child @entity32 's full @entity33 team to take on the @entity35 later this month in the @entity10 ‘ i also live down the road from @entity11 and there ’s a family connection , too , with the @entity10			1
me and my wife still have a laugh when we see my face on billboards or trolleys at the airport			0
it ’s a bit surreal but it ’s something i ’ve got to get used to and embrace			0
‘ i ’m happy to be back at work this week , though			2
it ’s starting to get a bit manic back up the road with it coming up so soon			0
‘ when you go up to the course now , as i did last week , you see the enormity of the tournament and the enormity of everything behind the scenes , the stands and the hospitality			2
you realise how big a deal it is			0
‘ the course is ultimately the same			0
it ’s just how much the infrastructure has changed and the practice area is all merchandise , and all the way down the first 18 is all hospitality			0
it ’s going to be fantastic for the public for viewing			0
it ’s a great stadium course and it ’s in fantastic condition			0
‘ knowing the course can only help me			0
i ’ve had seven top 10s round there and hit a lot of good shots over the years			2
when you are standing on tees or walking between shots you are definitely thinking positively			0
’ @entity149 ( from left to right ) , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity1 talk to the media the three wildcard names are added to a board displaying @entity33 's team , including @entity1 's			1

@entity1 will make his @entity158 debut next week
@entity10 returns to @entity11 for first time in more than 40 years
@entity1 has had seven top - 10 finishes on course and knows it very well
@entity72 's grandmother @entity13 passed away just after he was named wildcard
