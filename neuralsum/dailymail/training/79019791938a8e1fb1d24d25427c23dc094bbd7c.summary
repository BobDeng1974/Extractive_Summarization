by @entity0 published : 02:12 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 07:11 est , 18 march 2013 they are horrific pictures which highlight the worrying deterioration in @entity4 's security			1
two men - accused of stealing a motorised rickshaw - were badly beaten by vigilantes , stripped half - naked and hung by their feet in a crowded bus station in the @entity10			1
a baying crowd of 3,000 people watched , with some shouting ' kill them '			1
it was one of the most extreme cases of vigilantism in two years of sharp deterioration in security following @entity4 's 2011 uprising			1
the worsening security coupled with a police strike prompted the attorney general 's call for citizen arrests last week			1
the scene was emblematic of the chaos that is sweeping the country , mired in protests over a range of social , economic and political problems and with security breaking down to frightening proportions			0
the state - run newspaper @entity43 reported on its website that the two men were dragged in the street after being caught ' red - handed ' trying to steal a rickshaw			1
it said they were beaten but alive before they were hung			2
witnesses claimed the men had kidnapped a girl inside the rickshaw , but that she escaped unharmed			2
a photographer who witnessed the scene told @entity56 that some in the crowd of around 3,000 threatened to kill him if he took pictures of the lynching			1
he said that women and children in the crowd watched the men being hung by their feet , and that some even chanted in support of the lynching			1
brutal : it was one of the most extreme cases of vigilantism in two years of sharp deterioration in security following @entity4 's 2011 uprising residents also threatened to lynch another two men accused of being involved in the rickshaw theft			1
photographs from the scene show the two men hanging upside down from a rafter in their underwear at an open - air bus station in the town of @entity83 , about 55 miles ( 90 kilometers ) north of @entity84			1
some initial reports said they were hung from a tree but photos from the scene showed it was a rafter			2
other photographs show the men then lying on the ground dead in their underwear , with ropes around their feet			1
their bodies are covered in dirt , bruises , blood and lacerations as a group of angry looking men gathered around them			2
one man in the crowd grasped a knife in one fist and another held up a bloodied wooden stick			2
the witness said the crowd then took the bodies to a nearby police station and dumped them at the front door			1
@entity43 reported that police could not reach the site of the hangings because residents had cut off the roads to protest a shortage of diesel fuel , one of @entity4 's many crises			1
earlier in the day , residents of the nearby city of @entity123 had cut off a main train track to protest the fuel shortages			0
' the lack of security has created a sense of terror here , ' the witness said , speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal			0
' the entire area is shut down because of protests against the fuel shortages			0
' security officials said those who tried to help free the two men were pushed back by others in a crowd in the small town , which is in the @entity10 province of @entity144			1
they said they are preparing for possible blood feuds between residents of @entity83 and the nearby village of @entity148 , where the two men were from			2
the bodies were taken to the morgue for identification , according to security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media			0
similar attacks have happened elsewhere in @entity4 , though vigilante killings are not frequent			1
in 2012 in northern @entity159 province , police said relatives of a man who was killed when muggers tried to steal his car lynched one of the thieves			0
worrying : a huge crowd gathered to watch the lynching they then burned his body while it hung on a light pole			1
another vigilante incident that year was in the @entity10 province of @entity173 , where relatives of a victim took justice into their own hands and lynched two suspected killers			0
citizens have grown bolder in taking matters into their own hands following the 2011 uprising that ousted longtime authoritarian ruler @entity182			1
the country 's once powerful and feared police force was left weakened after the revolt			2
@entity4 is embroiled in another wave of political unrest that has also engulfed the nation 's police force			1
thousands of officers and low - ranking policemen have broken ranks , staging protests and waging strikes against what they say is the politicization of the force by president @entity199 and his interior minister			2
some of the striking police officers allege that the @entity203 group is attempting to control them			0
opponents of the attorney general 's call for citizen arrests fear that it is a prelude to the substitution of police by militias belonging to @entity199 's powerful @entity203 group and other allied @entity216 groups			2
on sunday , interior minister @entity217 , who oversees the country 's police , met with officers and low - ranking policemen to hear their demands			1
a statement from the ministry said @entity217 thanked the police for their efforts			0
two days earlier , @entity199 attended traditional @entity225 prayers at a @entity84 - based camp for riot police where he praised the force despite public criticism over their violent response to anti-government demonstrations			2
also on sunday , dozens of journalists protested outside their syndicate in @entity84 against what they claim were assaults on their colleagues by members of the @entity203			0
@entity238 , the newly elected head of the syndicate who replaced a figure considered by most journalists as @entity242 , condemned the alleged assault saturday evening outside the @entity203 's headquarters where journalists were covering a meeting			0
the journalists say that after activists sprayed @entity249 graffiti on the ground outside the headquarters , the @entity203 guards attacked with sticks and chains			0
the @entity203 said in a statement that guards outside the building were provoked and insulted by the activists and journalists			0
many of the group 's offices were attacked across the country in december during violent protests over the drafting of the constitution			0
police fired tear gas and a police vehicle was torched during saturday night 's clashes			0
@entity270 opposition party , led by @entity272 laureate @entity271 , blamed the @entity203 's leadership for allegedly encouraging ' militias ' loyal to the group to join the fight			0
in other developments , the @entity277 said a body of judges is reviewing an appeal against suspending parliamentary elections			0
the voting was slated to begin in april and be held in several stages through june			0
@entity199 's @entity216 supporters and some in the public exhausted by the turmoil hope the elections will be a step toward bringing some stability , accusing the opposition of stirring up unrest to derail the voting			0
but the mainly liberal and secular opposition has called for a boycott of the vote , saying @entity199 must first find some political consensus first to ease the wave of popular anger .			0
