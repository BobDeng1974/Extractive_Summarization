on december 8 , 2006 , @entity0 was midway through a season that would see him deliver the @entity2 and @entity3 double when he famously quipped about his ‘ untouchable ’ players			1
‘ @entity9 is untouchable because of the way he plays			1
@entity11 is untouchable because of the way he plays			1
it is not because i love them , ’ he said , pointing out that £ 30.8million @entity6 was not part of the gang			2
so , @entity9 was one , @entity11 was another , as was @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity22 's @entity9 ( left ) , @entity17 ( centre ) and @entity18 were ' untouchables ' @entity9 and @entity18 celebrate with @entity11 , another @entity22 star that was ' untouchable ' @entity15 and @entity20 were among those named as @entity0 's ' untouchable ' players @entity22 's six ' untouchables ' were named in the starting xi to face @entity29			1
they are @entity19 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
@entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 – all not ' untouchable ' – were bumped as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 were selected			2
nine in total that never needed to worry about whether their name was or was n’t on the team sheet when it was pinned on the board			2
they were the permanent fixtures and , nine years on , the idea has n’t changed			2
@entity19 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 are the automatic picks these days			1
choose any at random and there ’s method in @entity0 ’s madness			1
hazard , for example , is a given			2
dribbles and chances created aside , he has turned buying fouls into an art form			0
nine against @entity60 – a record in the @entity62 this season			0
as well as 28 fouls in @entity65 this year – more than any other player – and 74 in the @entity67 – again , more than anyone else			0
@entity19 , the club captain , is the leader			1
@entity31 , blood - stained boots et al , is the warrior			2
@entity34 is fouled during @entity22 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity60 in the @entity62 hazard has turned buying fouls into an art form as he was fouled nine times against @entity76 club @entity60 hazard of @entity22 sits on the pitch after being fouled during their @entity62 match on tuesday yet what about those not free from rotation ? the healthy competition among the rest starts at the back between goalkeeper @entity85 and @entity21			1
so much so that @entity0 likes to imagine football as being about nine outfield players and two goalkeepers			1
‘ we would give no chance to anyone , ’ he says , imaging that scenario			0
‘ we would be absolutely phenomenal because they ’re both phenomenal			0
’ he ’s not wrong			0
@entity85 is close to ‘ untouchable ’ but not quite			2
his error against @entity95 at @entity96 on january 31 – failing to collect a @entity98 cross under pressure from @entity100 – allowed @entity101 to equalise			0
it led to speculation @entity21 would reappear in @entity104 on tuesday night , particularly given he has yet to concede in 426 minutes of @entity67 football this year			1
he did n’t , @entity85 remained , and it proved the right call			0
@entity85 made five saves against @entity60 – some point blank , some pure reaction – helping @entity22 escape the @entity76 capital with an away goal and the advantage at 1 - 1			1
as @entity0 repeats , if a player is to become ‘ untouchable because of the way he plays ’ , then the @entity115 loanee did himself no harm			1
@entity21 ( left ) was once ' untouchable ' but has since been given competition by @entity85 ( right ) @entity22 goalkeeper @entity85 makes a save during the @entity62 round of 16 first leg in @entity104 @entity85 pulled off five saves against @entity60 on tuesday night to help @entity22 escape with a 1 - 1 advantage and so to another contest at @entity22 , between @entity37 and @entity40			1
the latter may previously have been considered ‘ untouchable ’ , but that ’s changed			2
@entity37 , particularly against @entity95 at @entity96 , looks far from a 20 - year - old newbie			2
that perfectly - timed tackle on @entity134 , for example , showed experience beyond the @entity76 youth ’s years			2
yet against @entity60 , @entity40 and his 33 @entity138 caps were preferred by @entity0			1
@entity139 , all 6ft 3in of the @entity141 international , tormented the defender			0
@entity40 was arguably at fault for @entity145 ’s goal , too , misjudging the cross and allowing the forward to nod the ball beyond a helpless @entity85			0
not the most convincing performance if he is to persuade @entity0 to prefer him over @entity37			1
this is a position very much available , and @entity22 captain @entity19 sympathises with the one that loses out : ‘ obviously we all want to play every game			1
' those two are fighting it out at the moment but it could be me at any time			0
what ’s important is that we remain top of the league and everybody gets game time			0
’ @entity37 ( left ) and @entity40 ( right ) are fighting for a place in @entity0 's @entity22 side @entity37 is looking to steal @entity40 's place in the @entity22 starting @entity169 as the youngster impresses @entity0 another battle at the back is between @entity36 and @entity39			1
yet the latter has made twice as many appearances ( 20 ) as the former ( 10 ) in the @entity67 this year			0
@entity36 last played in the @entity67 more than a month ago against @entity175 at the @entity176 on january 17 , when @entity39 was absent due to a groin injury			0
the former @entity179 left - back was used in the two @entity3 legs against @entity181 but the £ 16m buy has not made an appearance in february yet			2
@entity186 ’ relishes the healthy battle , most likely because he is winning			0
‘ in the big teams , there is always competition and the competition helps us to improve , ' he said before @entity192			0
' i like the competition and fight for my place every day			0
' i like the competition because it brings you to another level , and it ’s down to each player to impress the manager and make it difficult for him			2
’ @entity36 , playing second fiddle , is losing this contest and there does n't seem to be a whole lot he can do about it			0
@entity36 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) are competing for the left - back position at @entity22 @entity206 high fives goalkeeper @entity85 during their @entity62 match in the @entity76 capital the newest addition to @entity22 ’s squad , @entity211 , has arrived to interrupt @entity41 ’s otherwise must - pick status			1
in seven fewer appearances in @entity214 , @entity38 has twice as many goals ( 4 ) and assists ( 4 ) as @entity41 in the @entity67			0
he has also created more chances ( 36 ) and shots on target ( 20 ) than @entity41 ( 26 and 15 )			0
it was @entity38 that registered more assists ( 4 ) than any other player at the @entity223 in @entity224 , too			0
@entity41 has been @entity0 ’s first - choice right winger this year			1
yet perhaps his shortcomings in the final third can see his @entity228 counterpart – a £ 23.3m buy rising to £ 26.8m from @entity229 – capitalise			0
comparing one player ’s form in @entity214 to another ’s in the @entity67 can only be used to an extent , but the numbers speak for themselves			0
@entity38 seems to know a thing or two about winning fouls as , like @entity34 , he has won 87 in just 1,450 minutes of football			0
yet he must replicate his performances from @entity239 , if he is to keep @entity41 out			0
@entity41 ( left ) and new addition @entity211 ( right ) are competing to play under @entity0 @entity38 comes on for @entity41 during the @entity62 match between @entity22 and @entity60 click here to read @entity245 's match report from the @entity246 those that live on the fringe of @entity0 ’s team often ca n’t hack it			1
the ‘ reject xi ’ that have left the club since @entity0 ’s return to @entity22 in 2013 is telling			1
@entity254 in goal , with @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity16 filling a back four			1
then , there ’s @entity11 and @entity18 in midfield – both former ‘ untouchable ’ players – behind @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264			1
and , as a lone striker , @entity265			0
@entity0 is not afraid to rotate the big names , and get rid			1
@entity18 , now at @entity95 , knows that better than most			2
‘ i ’m not the kind of coach that gives places to people just because they are faces or names , ’ the @entity22 manager announced in 2007			1
‘ everybody with me has to fight for his place			0
’ the roles of @entity19 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 have made them immune to being dropped			2
it ’s now up to the others to join them on the pedestal			0
@entity22 's @entity31 pictured during the @entity62 last - 16 tie on tuesday night @entity31 scored for @entity22 and is among @entity0 's current crop of ' untouchable ' players @entity0 has his current ' untouchables ' at @entity22 and the other places are up for grabs at @entity96			1

@entity0 spoke about his ' untouchable ' players in december 2006
the @entity22 manager had nine players that he *deemed* ' untouchable '
they were @entity9 , @entity11 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21
