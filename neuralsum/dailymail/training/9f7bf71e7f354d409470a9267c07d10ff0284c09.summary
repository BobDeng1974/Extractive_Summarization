by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:12 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:43 est , 18 december 2013 the @entity3 has blocked @entity4 moves to scrap its second headquarters in @entity6 to stop the monthly travelling circus between @entity8 and @entity9			1
most of the @entity3 ’s work is done at a huge complex of offices and debating chambers in @entity9			1
but once a month 766 meps , their 3,000 staff , and 25 trucks carrying documents move from @entity9 to @entity6 for a week long session at a cost of £ 150million - a - year			1
spared : the @entity3 has blocked @entity4 moves to scrap its second headquarters in @entity6 ( pictured ) the costs and co2 emissions have soared as the @entity3 has become bigger and more powerful			1
the @entity8 have led opposition to the cost - saving move because the @entity6 economy depends heavily on the monthly influx of @entity16 , their officials and an army of lobbyists on fat expenses accounts			1
an additional £ 12 million would be saved on maintenance on the @entity6 building which is empty 300 days a year			1
with the @entity8 economy on the verge of slipping into a triple dip recession the country ’s meps are desperate to protect the historic and economic importance of the town ahead of the @entity3 elections in may			1
hotels in @entity6 are known to double or even triple their costs during the parliament ’s sessions			1
@entity6 symbolises the @entity46 reconciliation after the @entity47 as @entity48 is on the opposite bank of the river			2
upheaval : once a month 766 meps , their 3,000 staff , and 25 trucks carrying documents move from @entity9 ( pictured ) to @entity6 for a week long session at a cost of £ 150 - million - a - year last year the @entity8 government , which has plumbed record lows in popularity as the economy hovers close to triple dip recession , took legal action when @entity16 tried to cut the number of sessions in @entity6 each year			1
only last week a report by the @entity69 @entity4 mep @entity68 was adopted by 483 votes to 141 in favour of ending the link with @entity6 on cost and efficiency grounds			2
but the parliament ’s @entity77 committee , in a closed session , quietly this week shelved the report			0
with the eurozone also in a deep recession @entity16 were trying to put an end to the cost of having two parliamentary bases and to use @entity9 as the sole hq			0
there are a further 2.400 staff working in @entity88			0
more than one million @entity90 citizens have signed a petition calling for the @entity3 to be restricted to @entity9			0
headquarters : inside the @entity93 in @entity9 @entity68 , the @entity4 mep for @entity95 and @entity96 , whose report was accepted by three quarters of @entity16 , said : ‘ the vote this week is very disappointing			0
‘ rotating between two different countries costs at least £ 150 million a year and is an unacceptable waste of taxpayers ’ money			2
over the parliament ’s seven - year long term budget this will in fact cost taxpayers a staggering £ 928 million			2
in hard economic times , there are so many better things that could be spent on rather than empty buildings and needless and often complex journeys			0
’ the transport alone to @entity6 creates an estimated 19,000 tonnes of co2 emissions			0
‘ think how foolish the parliament looks when it allows this while lecturing its citizens about climate change , ’ said mr @entity68			0
‘ the @entity8 led the opposition as they are desperate to stop this happening before the @entity46 elections in may when the ruling @entity122 are going to be hammered because of the state of their economy			2
’ @entity126 , a fellow @entity69 @entity127 , said : ‘ the principle that the @entity3 should meet in just one place is a small thing – a tiny thing , when we consider the billions squandered in regional , structural and agricultural boondoggles			0
but , in the current economic climate , saving £ 150 million a year matters			0
‘ but one @entity8 mep @entity137 defended @entity6 ’s role			1
‘ you are turning your backs on the history and the founding principles of the @entity90 , ’ she said .			0

most of the @entity3 *'s* work is done in offices in @entity147
once a month 766 meps move to @entity6 for a week long session
move costs £ 150million per year , and requires 25 trucks to carry documents
@entity8 blocks scrapping second hq as @entity6 economy depends on it
