@entity27 , @entity6 @entity0 has the worst traffic congestion of any city across @entity30 and @entity31 , new data shows			1
although @entity8 and @entity7 remain frighteningly bad for congestion and are among the top 10 worst offenders , @entity0 , @entity1 , took top spot			1
traffic data organisation @entity36 used archived data to create a ranking of the worst cities and countries for traffic congestion			2
it also as detailed the average number of hours spent waiting in traffic at each centre			0
drivers in @entity8 waste a staggering 83.4 hours a year in traffic - the worst of the top 25 cities			1
those in @entity7 waste a slightly less shocking 64.3			0
drivers in @entity0 - the city ranked overall as the worst - only lose 57 hours a year			2
@entity36 used a detailed formula to produce its data that involved comparing a ' free flowing ' speed on a particular segment of road to real time traffic speeds taken during peak hours			0
wasted driving minutes were created by placing wasted minutes in traffic against estimated typical trip lengths and the average number of trips taken each year			0
in its findings , @entity36 said after seven years of only ' modest ' congestion , its 2013 report showed it was the same offenders topping the list			0
' simply put , it appears that congestion acted like a magnet - where it existed , it had a tendency to attract disproportionately more of it			1
' traffic is back on the rise in 2013 , even in countries showing continued declines			0
traffic congestion was up in six of the 15 countries analyzed : the @entity6 , @entity9 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity1			2
' and it is not good news for @entity30 drivers , with traffic congestion rising for the first time in two years			0
' with traffic congestion increasing at 3 times the rate of employment , 10 ‚Äê day long traffic jams like we 've seen in @entity88 and the 2 - 3 hour daily commutes that are part of daily life for people in @entity93 , @entity94 , today could become the reality for drivers in @entity30 and @entity31 in the not so distant future			1
' the @entity101 pictured during rush hour traffic is just one part of a massive number of streets in the city to suffer from congestion @entity2 , in @entity3 , was named the second worst city in @entity30 and @entity31 for its terrible traffic congestion @entity4 , @entity3 ( left ) and @entity5 , @entity110 ( right ) were placed third and fourth respectively in the list which ranked all the major cities in @entity30 and @entity31 @entity7 and @entity8 were fifth and sixth in the traffic congestion ranking - with @entity8 drivers thought to waste 83.4 hours a year navigating traffic @entity10 was the second worst @entity6 city in the rankings pictured here as traffic tries to navigate the famous @entity118 @entity11 , left , came eight on the rankings , while @entity12 , pictured as traffic circles its famed @entity121 , finished ninth @entity14 , in the @entity15 , came tenth and was the only @entity15 city to feature on the list the city of @entity16 in @entity125 , left , was particularly bad , while the pictured traffic island on @entity127 in @entity128 can be terrible during rush hour - helping put @entity17 eleventh on the list the illuminated cathedral in @entity18 , @entity3 , left , looks pretty - but the traffic trying to navigate the streets below it is less appealing			1
the city came thirteenth on the list			0
meanwhile this aerial view of @entity19 , @entity20 , pictured right , shows why the city came fourteenth on the rankings @entity21 was the next @entity9 city to make the list - the home of the @entity141 is also home to terrible traffic congestion it comes as no surprise @entity22 is on the rankings - placed sixteenth - the grid lock traffic in downtown is synonymous with the @entity150 next on the list was @entity6 city @entity23 , in @entity152 , which was seveteenth , while @entity24 , in @entity25 followed closely behind it in eighteenth position @entity26 , left , and the famous @entity154 's @entity27 , right , rounded out the top 20 worst congested cities , placing ninteenth and twentieth respectively			1
