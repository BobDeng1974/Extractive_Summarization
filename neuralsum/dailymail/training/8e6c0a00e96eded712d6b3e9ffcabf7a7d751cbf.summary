by @entity0 @entity1 planned to treat himself to a curry after moving into contention for a third @entity5 title in four years on friday			1
@entity1 carded a superb 67 at @entity6 to finish six under par , four shots behind joint leaders @entity9 and @entity11 and one ahead of the likes of @entity13 and @entity14			1
the former world no 1 carded six birdies and an eagle after the weather improved in late afternoon , with a run of five threes in succession from the eighth culminating in an eagle on the 12th			2
' when we were warming up the rain was coming down pretty heavy and the wind was blowing hard , ' said 2011 and 2012 champion @entity1 , who would join the likes of @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 as three - time champions of the @entity33 ’s flagship event			1
back in the hunt : @entity1 shot a sensational 67 for the second round of the @entity5 surge : @entity36 's @entity1 is now four shots off the leaders after an impressive round on friday ' it was wet for six or seven holes but for the rest of the day it was pretty nice			1
i ’m happy with the way i played and i holed some long putts which is always a bonus			2
' being nine behind after the first day seems like a big mountain to climb but now i ’m back in position to try to win this championship again			2
' @entity1 finished his round in style with a birdie from 25 feet on the 18th and added : ' dinner will taste good , i might enjoy a good curry			1
it ’s hard to find one in the @entity57			2
' @entity9 had set a new course record with his opening 62 and was pleased to recover from two over par after seven holes on friday to return a 72 , three better than playing partner @entity62 managed as the @entity63 fell away to one over for the week			1
' those were tough conditions for everybody out there today , ' the 43 - year - old @entity64 said			2
' especially on the front nine it was extremely difficult to get into a rhythm			0
back with the pack : @entity9 returned a 72 on day two after his course record 62 on thursday ' we played those first four holes in i do n’t know how long , and we had a couple of rulings in front of us			1
it was just impossible to find a good rhythm and @entity80 ( @entity81 ) left us with a back injury after five holes , so we got caught in a two - ball			0
' it just seems like all day we were waiting and waiting for a long time on a lot of these shots			2
it was a tough ask today so i was pretty pleased with the way i finished the round			0
' @entity9 birdied two of the last four holes to finish where he started the day , on 10 under , with @entity11 recovering from a double - bogey six on the ninth with birdies on the 10th , 12th , 17th and 18th			1
@entity11 won the @entity97 in bad weather as an amateur in 2009 and is a massive fan of @entity6 , finishing fourth here in 2011 and 12th last year			1
' i was good out there today , ' said @entity11 , whose best finish of the season was a share of 15th in the @entity106 last week			1
' i was mentally there and really enjoyed it			0
' it was tough for the front nine with the rain and stuff but it was a nice back nine and i managed to take advantage of it			0
' mixed conditions : joint leader @entity11 battled rain on the front nine but came home strong earlier in the day , @entity14 went from flirting with a third consecutive missed cut in this event to a place inside the top 10			1
a front nine of 38 left the former world number one just a shot outside the projected cut mark , but he eagled the 12th for the second day running and added birdies at three of the last four holes for a 71			0
@entity14 announced on wednesday that he had called off his planned november wedding to former world number one tennis player @entity131 , even though the invitations had just been sent out			1
' i was apprehensive going out yesterday , i honestly did n’t know what to expect and it was good i had the quick turnaround to get back on the golf course , ' the 25 - year - old said			0
' i have exceeded my expectations so far			0
once you get inside the ropes you are concentrating on your golf and it ’s almost a nice four or five - hour release to concentrate on the job at hand			0
' i stood here yesterday saying that i would be happy to make the cut and i ’m in for the weekend , which is nice			0
hopefully i can make a run at it			0
i feel like i ’m playing well enough to shoot something in the mid 60s and get myself in the mix going into sunday			0
