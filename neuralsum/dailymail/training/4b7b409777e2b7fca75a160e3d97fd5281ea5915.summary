by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 19:52 est , 21 february 2013 hardened : @entity2 figures show a worrying rise in repeat offenders			1
the number of criminals with 15 or more previous convictions or cautions is now one in three			1
picture posed by model a hardened core of 100,000 criminals convicted last year already had at least 15 offences to their names			1
this group of serial offenders is growing and now contains more than one in three of all criminals coming before the courts			1
worryingly , official figures show that less than four in ten were sent to jail last year , despite their lengthy criminal records			1
the number of offenders with such prolific records has shot up by more than 50 per cent in a decade			2
in 2002 they were responsible for less than one in five crimes annually and numbered some 64,000			0
but by last year that proportion was 33 per cent – a record high – and their numbers topped 103,000			0
they carry out over a quarter of all violent crimes , more than 40 per cent of burglaries and one in five drugs offences , according to the @entity2 which published the figures yesterday			1
the findings prompted demands for tougher jail terms to ensure the public is protected from unrepentant criminals			1
@entity44 , director of the @entity46 think - tank said : ‘ this suggests we could cut crime dramatically by locking up more serious , repeat offenders			1
‘ they are the ones who are responsible for a fast - growing percentage of all crimes			0
‘ unfortunately the number of prison places has n’t kept pace at all with the number of serious , repeat offenders , and last year only one in four serious offences led to a prison sentence			1
’ out of court warnings , penalties and cautions , september 2002 to september 2012 offenders receiving an indeterminate custodial sentence and average custodial sentence length for all offenders ; september 2002 to september 2012 a detailed breakdown of offending published yesterday showed the shocking annual toll on the public of the country ’s most prolific criminals			1
a total of 311,286 offenders were convicted last year for indictable – or serious – offences			1
a prolific burglar carried out nearly 100 offences during an eight - year crime spree			2
@entity81 , pictured , pleaded guilty to two counts of residential burglary earlier this month and was jailed for three years			2
but the court also heard the shocking extent of his criminal past which was taken into account			0
@entity89 @entity88 was told he admitted to police a further 92 offences dating back to 2005 , each of which was a similar break - in or act of thievery			2
in addition , he already has 20 previous convictions on top of those crimes			2
the 42 - year - old from @entity89 targeted homes in his home town , @entity104 and @entity105 in south @entity106			0
he stole expensive @entity107 and laptop computers , as well as jewellery including wedding rings and other items of sentimental value			0
the court heard he sold the goods and used the money to fund his drug habit			0
his previous convictions include burglary , theft and forced entry into premises			2
the offences include violent crimes , sex crimes , burglary , robbery and drug offences as well as more serious motoring offences			2
a decade ago , in 2002 , prolific offenders with 15 or more previous crimes were responsible for 19.4 per cent of all serious crimes – some 64,600 individual offences			1
by 2007 the proportion rose to one in four and their crimes numbered 78,000			0
but last year they made up one in three of all criminals coming before the courts – a total of 103,035			2
they were responsible for around 12,500 violent attacks , 10,200 burglaries and 52,000 acts of thievery or handling stolen goods			0
in addition , they carried out 13,250 drug crimes , more than 500 sex offences and around 8,000 uncategorised offences			0
despite their lengthy records , just 39 per cent were jailed on the spot , while the remainder were given community sentences , suspended jail terms , fines or lesser punishments			0
by contrast , the number of first - time offenders is falling sharply			0
there were 187,700 offenders with no existing record caught last year , a fall of 12 per cent in a year and down more than 40 per cent in five years			1
positive signs include a fall in the number of cautions issued by the police – down 12 per cent in a year to 205,700			0
ministers defended the figures , pointing to sharp falls in crime in recent years			1
justice minister @entity174 said : ‘ crime is falling and the use of cautions is now at its lowest level for over a decade			0
‘ a greater proportion of convicted criminals are going to prison and their sentences are longer than ever before			1
‘ however , reoffending rates have barely changed in a decade and we can not go on doing the same thing and expecting a different result			0
‘ that is why we are pressing ahead with major reforms that will tackle this problem			0
’ caged : average sentence lengths have jumped sharply in the last ten years			1

@entity2 figures show worrying rise in hardened criminals
convictions for serious and more minor offences see rise
average prison sentence length jumps dramatically in 10 years
