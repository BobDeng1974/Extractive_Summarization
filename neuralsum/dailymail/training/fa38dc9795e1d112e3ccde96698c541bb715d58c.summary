by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 09:39 est , 23 february 2014 @entity4 : 18:12 est , 23 february 2014 @entity5 has been forced to defend its disappointing medal haul at @entity7 , with @entity10 @entity9 officials insisting they are ' proud ' of the country 's athletes			1
@entity10 placed fourth in the gold medal tally behind host country @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 with just nine golds , but came in second with its overall medal haul			1
the country 's poor show in the speedskating , hockey and figure skating has been blamed for its rankings drop , with this year 's medal haul about 20 percent lower than the 2010 @entity29 total			1
yet despite @entity15 's dominance , @entity10 officials argue this was one of @entity10 's best games ever			1
' i could n't be more proud of our @entity9 team , ' @entity35 chairman @entity34 said			0
medal count : @entity5 came in second behind @entity15 in the total medal count , and finished fourth in the gold medal count final medal : @entity44 piloted the @entity10 to the bronze in the men 's four - man bobsled at the @entity7 , placing the @entity10 second in the @entity7 medal count a bronze in the four - man bobsled on a day @entity15 put an exclamation point on its games gave the @entity10 28 medals in @entity7 , putting it behind just the host country in total medals			1
but @entity16 won more gold than the @entity10 ( 11 - 9 ) and the 28 total medals were nine less than @entity10 won in a record - setting performance four years ago in @entity29			1
that total - five less than won by @entity15 - would have been far less if @entity10 athletes did n't win nine medals , including five gold , in sports that made their debut in these games			1
to make matters worse , @entity17 won more gold medals than its much bigger neighbor for the second @entity70 in a row			2
' we came here to compete , ' said @entity74 , managing director of sport performance for the @entity35			0
' we came here with a great team and they 've done a great job			0
things do n't always shake out exactly the way you think they 're going to , but the surprises are sometimes way more surprising than the disappointments			0
' among the disappointments were the biggest @entity10 stars going into the games			2
@entity88 got shut out in snowboard and @entity90 did n't even make the trip because of injury			0
disappointing : @entity93 @entity88 arrived in @entity7 trying to win two gold medals , but left with none let down : @entity5 figure skater @entity96 became an internet sensation for her disappointed facial expression but at least one new star was born			1
teen skiing sensation @entity100 won gold in the women 's slalom and liked it so much that she was already making plans for a record - setting performance four years from now in @entity106			0
' right now , i 'm dreaming of the next @entity70 ( and ) winning five gold medals , which sounds really crazy , ' @entity100 said the day after her win			2
' i 'm sorry i just admitted that to you all			0
' @entity100 's win in her first @entity70 could n't make up for the collapse of the @entity10 speedskating team , which was blanked in old suits and new			2
can we clone her ? teen skiing sensation @entity100 , 18 , won gold in the women 's slalom at her first @entity70 talking it up : @entity10 @entity35 chairman @entity34 ( right , pictured with @entity15 president @entity120 ) insists he is ' proud ' of the @entity10 team speedskaters were kept off the medal podium for the first time since 1984 , despite a switch midway through the games back to their old suits			1
' @entity129 ever , ' two - time gold medalist @entity128 said			0
while the @entity10 failed to win a medal on the @entity7 big oval , skaters from the @entity131 piled on with eight golds and 23 medals overall in speedskating			1
' if you look at speedskating results we were n't the only nation that got smoked by the @entity131 , ' said @entity141 , ceo of the @entity35			2
however , commentators say that as the rest of the world improves its training and performance , @entity10 is lagging behind			2
@entity147 reported the decision to train at high altitude and outdoors in @entity151 before coming to an @entity70 with an indoor track at sea level became a cause of concern following the disappointing performance			0
@entity157 , the sport 's governing body in the @entity10 , has also been accused of ' losing its way '			2
' it 's like @entity162 , ' coach @entity160 told the @entity163 , citing constant infighting and frequent turnover of coaches , high - performance directors and executives			0
the @entity131 , who won a record 23 speedskating medals in @entity7 , ' have trained right by the water their whole lives and understand how to push heavy air and what tempo is required , ' one source told the @entity163			0
' our team is trying to glide and carry speed like in @entity180 and it 's not working			0
' not the clothes : @entity70 officials have dismissed claims @entity10 speedskaters performed badly because of the new uniforms made by @entity186 ( worn here by @entity128 ) trouble in paradise : @entity5 's speedskating team , including , ( pictured left to right ) @entity189 , @entity128 and @entity191 ( right ) , failed to win a single medal at @entity7 things were n't much better on the ice for @entity10 figure skaters , who won a bronze in the new team event but were shut out individually			1
@entity198 and @entity199 took a bit of the sting out of that performance with a gold medal in ice dancing			1
however commentators say the absence of a ' four - year plan ' has been blamed for the decline in @entity210 's performance in figure skating			1
@entity212 , editor - in - chief at @entity213 , said this is merely a ' lull ' or low ' cycle ' that every nation experiences			0
however @entity219 reported there is some hope for the @entity10 team , with 18 - year - old @entity223 establishing herself as a solid medal contender , while 19 - year - old @entity225 could be a threat once he masters the quadruple jump			2
' the next ( four years ) should be really interesting , ' @entity229 said after finishing fourth in women 's singles			0
winners : @entity198 and @entity199 took a bit of the sting out of the disappointing @entity10 medal tally with their gold medal - winning performance in ice dancing not so great : the @entity10 men 's hockey team , including goaltender @entity240 , left @entity7 disappointed meanwhile , both the men 's and women 's hockey team left disappointed			1
the women appeared on their way to winning gold before collapsing in the final minutes against @entity17 , while the men could n't score against either @entity17 or @entity248 , which handed the @entity10 an embarrassing 5 - 0 loss in the bronze medal game			1
on the slopes , @entity100 and @entity251 both win gold and the @entity10 took five medals , making for a respectable showing			1
but the @entity10 was shut out in the new sport of women 's ski jumping where @entity10 had looked promising , and there were no medals in either cross-country skiing or the biathlon , sports that @entity16 dominated			2
figure skater : @entity223 , 18 , has established herself as a strong medal contender in addition to winning more golds than the @entity10 , @entity16 - with a population of just five million - finished just two medals behind in the total with 26			1
@entity74 said the @entity10 medal haul was lower partly because other countries are becoming more competitive in winter sports			1
he said the team would have liked to have won more medals , but called their performance excellent anyway			0
if there is reason to be more optimistic heading toward the games in @entity106 in 2018 , team officials said it was the strong performance in new sports like ski and snowboard slopestyle and ski halfpipe			0
but replicating that success in extreme sports in future @entity70 will be difficult , said @entity286 , the former chief of sport performance for the @entity35			0
' the rest of the world is catching up , ' he said .			0

@entity10 was placed second in the overall medal tally with 28 medals , behind @entity15
@entity10 ranked fourth in the gold medal tally , with nine golds
medal haul about 20 percent lower than in 2010
results considered ' disappointing ' with figure skating and speedskating blamed
