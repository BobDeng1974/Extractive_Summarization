a @entity1 machine gun found in a downed @entity2 has been fired for the first time in 70 years			1
the weapon worked despite being buried in peat since the aeroplane that housed it plummeted to earth in @entity8 in 1941			0
a team from the @entity10 went to the site and dug the guns from where the @entity2 had crashed and could even smell aviation fuel in the air			1
six @entity1 machine guns were found in good nick thanks to the ideal clay , soil and peat condition despite being buried for the last 70 years , the @entity1 machine gun worked perfectly there were six guns that presenter @entity23 reported were in ' great shape , with belts containing hundreds of gleaming .303 rounds			0
' they even found pilot @entity29 's leather helmet among the wreckage			2
the guns were cleaned and a couple of pieces were straightened out after suffering some damage on impact			0
the soil , clay and peat had provided the perfect conditions for the artefacts to be preserved and , when fired , they worked like a treat			0
mr @entity23 continued : ' the gun fired without a hitch			0
there can be no greater testament to the machinists and engineers in @entity50 factories in the 1940s who , despite churning out guns at the rate of thousands per month , made each one of such high quality that they could survive a plane crash and 70 years underground and still fire like the day they were made			1
' excavation work at the site on the moors above @entity8 uncovered the wreckage of the @entity2 - much of it was still intact hundreds of bullets were found with the @entity1 machine gun when @entity65 crashed his @entity2 into a peat bog in @entity67 during @entity68 , few thought it would ever be seen again			1
the pilot who bailed out immediately wanted to climb into the cockpit of another military aircraft and continue fighting for the allies			2
knowing that his fighter was doomed , the young @entity74 officer had radioed : ' i 'm going over the side ' before parachuting to safety moments before impact			0
historian @entity23 led the project to dig the @entity2 out of the peat bog almost 70 years after the pilot bailed out of the doomed plane but instead of fighting again the serviceman was interned in a camp - where captured @entity50 and @entity87 troops mixed freely with the @entity89 enemy			1
despite managing to escape from @entity67 , neutral during the war , and making his way back to @entity50 , the 23 - year - old was sent back to the camp			1
fearing a diplomatic row , the @entity94 returned @entity65 to the most relaxed of ' prison ' camps in @entity67 where he was kept for a further two years			1
the pilot from @entity100 had been stripped of his @entity87 citizenship after agreeing to fight for the @entity50 because the @entity87 had not yet joined the war			1
now almost 70 years after the pilot from the 133 ' @entity104 crash - landed in the north of @entity67 in november 1941 , his crashed plane has been recovered			1
the @entity2 was the first of 20 made with a donation from a @entity110 millionaire called @entity111 who wanted to support the @entity112 in the @entity113 with a Â£ 100,000 donation			1
remarkably large parts of the plane have been recovered from the bog			2
six machine guns and about 1,000 rounds of ammunition were also discovered by archaeologists searching the @entity122 in @entity8			0
@entity123 lost his @entity87 citizenship in 1941 when he signed up to fight for the @entity74 the excavation was carried out as part of a @entity10 @entity67 programme			1
historian @entity23 said : ' the plane itself is obviously kind of wreckage and the big pieces survived			0
we 're expecting to find things like the engine and there still may be personal effects in the cockpit			0
@entity65 pictured here at the internment camp where he was held ' it 's just incredible because it 's just so wet here that the ground just sucked it up and the plane was able to burrow into it and it 's been preserved			2
' it 's in amazing condition , ' he told @entity152 radio			0
mr @entity23 said mr @entity153 was forced to abandon his spitfire over the @entity155 when its engine overheated about 13 miles from his base at @entity158 , now @entity159 , in @entity67			0
aviation archeologist @entity160 told the @entity161 that it was highly significant that the doomed plane had been recovered			2
' the pilot was lucky to survive that day because if his engine had failed a few minutes earlier he would have ended up in the sea , ' he said			2
landing on neutral soil , the 23 - year - old pilot was interned at @entity169 detention camp in @entity170 for two years			1
with fishing trips , fox hunts and football matches it sounded almost like a holiday camp - and seemingly the ideal place to be holed up as war raged across the rest of @entity179			1
the guards were only issued with blank rounds , visitors were permitted and there were frequent excursions to nearby pubs			0
around 40 @entity74 pilots who crashed in @entity67 were held in the corrugated iron huts alongside the @entity89 enemy			1
the crew of destroyed u-boats and @entity192 planes also ended up at the camp			2
a team of @entity196 recruits at the @entity197 , just outside @entity198 , where @entity65 was held for two years during @entity68 the warring nations even played football matches against each other - with the @entity89 defeating the largely @entity203 team 8 - 3 , in a precursor to their repeated post-war footballing triumphs over their @entity207 enemy			1
spitfires fly over @entity50 - the recovered fighter had been remarkably well preserved by the bog but although servicemen were free to come and go from the camp @entity65 , who died in 1994 , was determined to fight on			1
in december 1941 , just two weeks after his crash , the serviceman made his way into @entity198 before hopping onto a train to @entity218 which was @entity50 territory			1
as his doomed plane came down he parachuted out before watching it plunge into the ground half a mile away			0
although he made his way back to @entity158 , he was returned to the @entity196 camp where he spent a further two years before it was closed			2
belatedly he got his wish , and in 1943 he was allowed to return to frontline action as the tide of the war turned in the @entity112 direction			0
it is only because of the unusually soft ground that the crashed @entity230 could be recovered in the 70th year after the crash			0
the @entity232 said the six @entity234 machine guns and approximately 1,000 rounds of ammunition were discovered by a team of archaeologists from @entity239 buried up to 30 feet in the bog			0
' the six machine guns and ammunition have been removed by the bomb disposal team to a secure military location where they will be decommissioned and cleaned before being handed over to the @entity247 , ' a spokesman added			0
the plane will now be preserved and go on display at the @entity250 in @entity159 .			0
