many of us embark on quick - fix diets to get beach ready at the 11th hour			2
but juice cleanses and trendy diets such as the raw food plan can wreak havoc with your teeth , an expert has warned			1
as well as tooth decay , other non-desirable side effects such as bad breath and extra bacteria in the mouth can be the result of extreme dieting efforts , says dr @entity18 , clinical director at @entity20 - based dental practice elleven			1
the diet , which sees people swap meals for smoothies and juices , causes insulin levels to peak and then plummet which , over time , alters the structure of collagen in the body and affects the gums because collagen fibres hold teeth in place , he explained			1
the juice from fruit and vegetables tend to have a high acid content , which severely damages the enamel of your teeth in a similar way to fizzy drinks			0
dr @entity18 explained that while fruit and vegetables are considered healthy acids , this is only the case when they are consumed as a whole , rather than as a concentrated juice			1
‘ fruit ’s natural sugar , fructose , is a common cause of cavities as the bacteria in the mouth feed on it , so be careful when you do consume juice as part of a balanced diet			1
’ he advises drinking juice through a straw and waiting half an hour before brushing your teeth afterwards			0
celebrities including @entity89 ( left ) and @entity90 are said to follow the 5 : 2 diet			0
this is an eating plan when people eat a low - carb - high - protein diet ( such as a chicken salad , right ) and on ‘ fast days ’ their bodies breaks down fat trendy diets are leaving millions of @entity99 with stomach aches and other digestive problems , according to new research			1
just under half of all adults suffer some pain when they try and lose weight and 55 per cent of people aged 25 - 34 – who are most likely to try ‘ faddy ’ diets - are in discomfort			0
a report by @entity113 's @entity112 said that the age group was most likely to try regimes such as @entity116 and @entity117			0
in a survey of 2,000 adults , it found that half are on a diet			0
those suffering stomach ache are likely to give up their quest to lose weight and pile on the pounds			0
health expert dr @entity127 said : " it is so important to be aware our digestive health can affect our weight , with so many of us apparently unable to maintain our weight at a healthy level			0
’ ‘ keeping our digestive health in tip - top condition is vital for weight management as well as our overall health			0
’ the @entity137 , @entity138 celebrities including @entity89 and @entity90 are said to follow the 5 : 2 diet			0
this is an eating plan when people eat a low - carb - high - protein diet and on ‘ fast days ’ their bodies breaks down fat			2
‘ this process results in your body going into a state called ketosis which produces the chemicals that cause bad breath , ’ dr @entity18 said			1
‘ @entity154 is brought on entirely by your diet and unfortunately no amount of flossing and brushing will combat the smell so think twice before cutting out carbs completely and stick to healthy ones such wholemeal pasta and wholemeal bread – these will keep bad breath away whilst staying trim			1
’ @entity163 a number of ‘ milkshake plans ’ encourage people to swap two meals a day for a calorie - controlled milkshake , but the drinks can contain up to 18g of sugar per serving			1
the drinks , consumed by celebrities including @entity173 , can cause tooth decay and promote plaque build - up which leads to cavities which can not be washed or brushed away , dr @entity18 warned			1
he advises dieters to read the label of such shakes carefully to choose the least sugary options as well as rinsing their mouths with water or chewing gum afterwards to reduce the effect on the milkshakes might have on their teeth			0
' healthy meal replacements ' ‘ diet plans that offer people ready - made calorie controlled meal replacements , tend to take out the fat and replace it with extra sugar and salt to keep the flavour			2
this can be extremely damaging to your teeth , ’ dr @entity18 said			1
some replacement snacks are higher in sugar than regular snacks and people who snack are at higher risk of tooth decay because eating between meals increases the contact between sugar and teeth throughout the day			2
as well as cooking low calorie meals at home , where the salt and sugar content can be monitored , the dentist recommends that people switch coffee for green tea , which reduces teeth staining and helps to fight bacterial infection and inflammation			2
' milkshake plans ’ encourage people to swap two meals a day for a calorie - controlled milkshake ( illustrated right ) , but the drinks can contain up to 18g of sugar per serving			1
@entity173 ( left ) is said to have followed such a plan , which can cause tooth decay and promote plaque build - up @entity231 while sticking to raw foods such as fruits , vegetables , nuts and seeds , like celebrities such as @entity238 and @entity239 , sounds like a healthy plan , they can damage your teeth			1
‘ despite the sugars in fruit being natural , when they make their way into your mouth , there is no difference between the sugars from fruit and the sugars from chocolate or sweets , ’ he said			0
‘ all this sugar is constantly eroding your teeth and acts like a time bomb			0
small problems mount up on each tooth , leading to cavities and larger dental issues which can be painful and very expensive to resolve			2
’ dr @entity18 also warned that nuts and seeds are easily lodged between teeth so it is easier for bacteria to attach to teeth and multiply			1
he advises that people floss or chew gum after a snack of nuts			0
