the @entity0 will phase out the show 's iconic elephants from its performances by 2018 , telling the @entity4 exclusively that growing public concern about how the animals are treated led to the decision			1
executives from @entity9 , @entity0 's parent company , said the decision to end the circus 's century - old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length as elephants have often been featured on @entity0 's posters over the decades			1
' there 's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers , ' said @entity21 , the company 's executive vice president			1
' a lot of people are n't comfortable with us touring with our elephants			0
13 animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018 while one elephant is on a breeding loan to the @entity49			1
another reason for the decision , company president @entity53 said , was that certain cities and counties have passed ' anti-circus ' and ' anti-elephant ' ordinances			1
the company 's three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year , and @entity21 said it 's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction			1
it 's also difficult to plan tours amid constantly changing regulations , he said			0
' all of the resources used to fight these things can be put towards the elephants , ' @entity21 said during an interview at the @entity39			1
' we 're not reacting to our critics ; we 're creating the greatest resource for the preservation of the @entity77 elephant			0
' the circus will continue to use other animals - this year it added a @entity82 troupe of camel stunt riders to its @entity85 show and it will likely showcase more motorsports , daredevils and feats of humans ' physical capabilities			1
@entity0 's popular @entity92 - based competitor , @entity91 , features human acts and does n't use wild animals			1
' there are endless possibilities , ' said @entity97 , another executive vice president of the company and a producer of @entity101 's @entity100 , @entity102 on ice and @entity104 shows , among others			1
@entity21 owns the largest herd of @entity77 elephants in @entity108			2
it costs about $ 65,000 yearly to care for each elephant , and @entity53 said the company would have to build new structures to house the retiring elephants at the center , located in between @entity114 and @entity115 on a rural , ranchlike property			1
@entity53 said initially the center will be open only to researchers , scientists and others studying the @entity77 elephant			0
eventually , he ' hopes it expands to something the public will be able to see			2
' ' i want everybody 's grandkids to be able to see @entity77 elephants , ' he said			0
the center 's youngest elephant is @entity131 , who will be 2 in august , and the oldest is @entity132 , who is 69			0
one elephant , 6 - year - old @entity135 , was conceived by artificial insemination			2
since the center opened in 1995 , 26 elephants have been born there			0
a male elephant scratches on the bars of his pen at the @entity0 and @entity144 in @entity41 @entity53 , ceo of @entity9 , feeds @entity21 and @entity145 at the @entity0 and @entity144 in @entity41 there will be a new structure built to house the retiring elephants , and the company hopes to open the conservation to the public eventually @entity0 's elephants have been at the center of lawsuits and ongoing complaints from animal rights activists			1
in 2014 , @entity9 won $ 25.2 million in settlements from a number of animal - rights groups , including the @entity160 , ending a 14 - year legal battle over unproven allegations that @entity0 circus employees mistreated elephants			1
the initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 by a former @entity0 barn helper who was later found to have been paid at least $ 190,000 by the animal - rights groups that helped bring the lawsuit			2
the judge called him ' essentially a paid plaintiff ' who lacked credibility and standing to sue			0
the judge rejected the abuse claims following a 2009 trial			0
@entity53 testified during that trial about elephants ' importance to the show			0
' the symbol of @entity0 is the elephant , and that 's what we 've been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years			2
' when asked by a lawyer whether the show would be the same without the elephants , @entity21 replied , ' no , it would n't			2
' this week , @entity21 said , ' things have changed			0
' ' how does a business be successful ? by adapting , ' he said			0
@entity21 noted that when his father bought the circus in 1967 , there was still a human sideshow featuring acts such as the bearded lady and other human oddities			2
his father did away with that , he said			0
' we 're always changing and we 're always learning , ' he said			0
in 2008 , @entity21 acquired a variety of motor sports properties , including monster truck shows , motocross and the @entity206 , which promotes drag races and other events			2
in 2010 , it created a theatrical motorcycle stunt show called @entity211			0
roughly 30 million people attend one of @entity21 's 5,000 live entertainment shows every year .			1

the @entity0 has announced they are phasing out their elephant acts , and will eliminate them in 2018
the decision was largely based on the fact that many cities have anti-circus and anti-elephant ordinances in addition to public outcry
the company 's three shows visit 115 cities each year , and vice president @entity21 said it 's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction
13 animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the company 's 200 - acre @entity39 in @entity41
there will be a new structure built to house the retiring elephants , and the company hopes to open the conservation to the public eventually
the circus will still continue to use other animals , including @entity82 camels , which they just added to their live shows this year
