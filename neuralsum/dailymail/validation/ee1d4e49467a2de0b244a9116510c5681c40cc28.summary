humans , sea lions and seals alike are sharing in the bounty of the @entity4			1
flying over the @entity7 during a telemetry survey , the @entity6 @entity5 caught a photo of what looked like fish washed up at low tide			0
but it was actually more than 6,400 regionally based harbor seals			0
it 's not unusual , @entity17 biologist @entity16 , to see 4,000 to 5,000 of them hauled out on @entity19 , between the @entity20 and @entity21 in the @entity4 , a fraction of the 15,000 regional population from @entity24 north to @entity25 , @entity6			2
' they 've been moving seasonally into the @entity4 in response to smelt runs forever , ' he said			0
during a feb. 11 aerial survey , the @entity6 @entity5 counted more than 1,200 @entity31 sea lions at the @entity34 , along with nearly 600 @entity39 and @entity31 sea lions on the @entity40 all - time high : the @entity42 agency counted 2,340 @entity31 sea lions at the @entity34 @entity34 during a feb. 11 aerial survey , @entity17 also counted more than 1,200 @entity31 sea lions at the @entity45 , along with nearly 600 @entity39 and @entity31 sea lions on the @entity40			1
on friday , spokeswoman @entity48 of the @entity42 said , her agency counted 2,340 @entity31 sea lions at the @entity45			1
increasing numbers of pinnipeds , driven by starvation in @entity31 to the healthy smelt and salmon runs in the @entity4 , have put a strain on the @entity20 's infrastructure and created enmity between fishers , conservationists and fishery agencies			1
in 2010 , @entity52 , known as eulachon , were marked threatened under the federal @entity61			0
the past two years have marked the first time since the designation that they 've been allowed for commercial and recreational harvest			0
fisheries managers estimated 200 million smelt returning to the @entity4 in 2014 and a similarly strong run this year			0
and sea lions reserved their spot at the dinner table			1
their seats are largely at the @entity20 's @entity45 , which has two docks for boats , and two unofficially for sea lions , that also cover the rock breakwaters surrounding the marina			1
fisheries agencies counted 1,256 @entity31 sea lions there feb. 11 ; 1,649 feb. 20 ; 1,211 march 2 ; and 2,340 on friday , which @entity48 said was an all - time high			1
' i think that will be telling once the smelt run is done , how many sea lions leave , ' @entity48 said			1
' they 're already tapering off			0
' beating them back : @entity89 ribbon is shown placed along a dock of the @entity45 in @entity20 , @entity35			1
the @entity91 has successfully used the ribbon to deter sea lions from jumping onto the dock but even when the smelt are gone , an estimated 312,600 adult spring chinook salmon are expected to provide a continuing food source			1
a @entity98 report in october showed a decrease in chinook salmon survival from 90 percent in 2010 to 55 percent in 2014			0
it compared the decrease in survival with a more than 670 percent increase in sea lion populations counted by @entity42 in @entity20 between march 15 and may 15 over the same years			2
amid the issues of sea lion predation , the @entity20 has maintained it only wants to keep sea lions from damaging its docks , estimating more than $ 100,000 in damage to utilities and the docks themselves from sea lions			1
it has removed docks , disconnected utilities from the two that the sea lions inhabit and strung brightly colored surveying tape , which has effectively dissuaded the animals from jumping onto the two docks with boats still tied to them			2
' there 's a public health issue , ' said @entity123 and project manager @entity124 about fecal coliform in the water and the mounds of feces with the ringworm fungus that @entity20 staff clean up off docks			2
the @entity20 has looked into galvanized steel railings — for years now — to keep sea lions from jumping up on docks			1
there is 5,000 feet to cover on the @entity20 's three docks at the basin , operations manager @entity135 said at a march 17 @entity140 meeting			0
the railings have worked in @entity142 , but would cost $ 50,000			0
@entity124 added the @entity20 will be meeting with @entity144 - @entity143 next week , which creates a low - voltage matting for docks that is uncomfortable for sea lions			1
starving : increasing numbers of pinnipeds , driven by starvation in @entity31 to the healthy smelt and salmon runs in the @entity4 , have put a strain on the @entity20 's infrastructure and created enmity between fishers , conservationists and fishery agencies			2
for several years , the @entity159 has kept a regular presence at the basin , monitoring @entity42 's trapping and branding and reporting on its @entity165 page			0
members snap photos of visitors who drop by to see sea lions and regularly attend @entity20 meetings to testify on behalf of pinnipeds			1
' i want to talk about sharing on the second biggest river in @entity175 , ' @entity172 , brigade member , told the @entity140 march 17 , after being told she could n't comment a second time on sea lions			2
brigade members see sea lions as a scapegoat for larger issues , such as pollution , climate change , overfishing and thousands of miles of blocked fish passages			2
they 've claimed that @entity186 once offered to pay for a sea lion haul - out , although the @entity20 has previously denied being offered funding			2
regardless of whether they 're hauling out on @entity20 docks or their own haul - out , @entity124 said , letting them on docks is akin to domesticating a wild animal			0
the @entity20 started shutting down the causeway to the @entity45 when @entity42 is trapping and branding sea lions to track them , a practice authorized in 2012 by @entity98 and not as deadly as the euthanizations at @entity199 , but nonetheless controversial			1
tensions over the practice came to a near boiling point feb. 18 , according to @entity42			0
@entity48 said a visitor to the basin had been approached by a branding protester			0
the visitor then approached and harassed the @entity42 employee , she said , before threatening to grab a shotgun and shoot her			0
@entity48 said @entity42 reported the incident to the @entity208 , which could n't be reached for comment by press time			0
amid the issues of sea lion predation , the @entity20 has maintained it only wants to keep sea lions from damaging its docks , estimating more than $ 100,000 in damage to utilities and the docks themselves from sea lions			1

a *february* survey counted some 1,200 @entity31 sea lions at the @entity45 in @entity20 , @entity35 *--* that number leaped to 2,340
