by @entity0 published : 08:31 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 08:41 est , 24 july 2013 @entity1 is the most depressing social network and even worse than @entity3 , according to a @entity5 magazine			1
@entity6 from @entity7 claims that @entity1 takes the parts of @entity3 that make people feel depressed and unsatisfied with their lot , such as looking at other people 's photos and friend 's broadcasting how great their lives are , and accentuates them			1
this then creates feelings of intense jealousy and also crosses the ' grey line of stalkerism '			2
a journalist for @entity5 magazine @entity7 puts forward the idea that @entity1 is the most depressing social network , and is worse than @entity3 and @entity24 for people bragging , posting smug photos and creating feelings of jealousy @entity6 claims @entity1 is depressing because it is photo - led			1
photos are the most explicit way for people to show off in her article , @entity6 speaks to communications and psychology professors that have previously written studies on the effects of @entity3 in a bid to bolster her claims			1
the first reason why @entity6 believes @entity1 is so depressing is that it ' purifies ' the three worst aspects of @entity3 associated with causing envy			1
she names this as scrolling through hundreds of other people 's photos - including strangers ' - liking images and seeking likes and approval from peers , and announcing to millions of people how great their lives are			2
winter claims that @entity1 takes these traits and amplifies them			1
she adds this is because the site is picture - led and photos are the easiest way for people to show off because they provide an isolated snapshot in time			0
@entity60 of @entity61 told @entity6 : ' you get more explicit and implicit cues of people being happy , rich , and successful from a photo than from a status update			0
she continues : ' if you see beautiful photos of your friend on @entity1 , one way to compensate is to self - present with even better photos , and then your friend sees your photos and posts even better photos , and so on			1
' self - promotion triggers more self - promotion , and the world on social media gets further and further from reality			0
' @entity1 photos also cross the ' grey line of stalkerism ' , according to @entity6			1
this is because it 's easier to strike up a conversation about a shared article on @entity3 , for example , without it seeming too personal			2
however , if someone tells a stranger they 've looked through their photos , it can seem intrusive viewers also do n't know what else is happening around the image			0
for example , a couple on holiday could be posting beautiful images while arguing the whole time			0
@entity6 believes this gives a distorted view of the person posting the photo 's world , which in turn distorts the viewers ' opinion of their own lives			0
it leads people to think their life is n't fulfilling enough and makes them feel depressed			0
she adds that the more someone does this , the more distorted their view becomes and the less meaningful their life feels			0
winter continues that as well as making people feel depressed , @entity1 also crosses the ' grey line of stalkerism			2
' she uses the example of a science article being posted on @entity3 compared to a honeymoon photo being uploaded to @entity1			1
@entity6 explains that if a friend posts a science article on @entity3 , it 's easier to strike up a conversation about the article without it seeming too personal			2
however , if someone tells a friend , or even someone they do n't know , that they 've looked through their honeymoon photos , it can seem personal and intrusive - even if the photos were shared publicly			0
@entity3 can make you feel socially isolated and miserable because seeing friends ' happy pictures triggers feelings of envy , according to experts from @entity150 's @entity61 and @entity152 's @entity151			1
they claim one in three people feel worse after visiting the site and that their ' general dissatisfaction ' with life had increased			0
the @entity158 researchers studied 600 people and found that those who browsed without contributing were more likely to feel bad afterwards			0
positive images of friends enjoying holidays , commenting on their happy lives or simply posting pet pictures was enough to trigger feelings of jealousy , the @entity3 test group said what riled them most were happy holiday snaps of ' @entity3 friends ' followed by gushing prose of fabulous lives , great jobs and cracking social diaries			1
the academics added people who surfed a lot on such sites were in danger of becoming socially isolated and depressed .			0
