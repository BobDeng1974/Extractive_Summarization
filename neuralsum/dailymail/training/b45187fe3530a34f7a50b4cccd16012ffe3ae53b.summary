@entity1 ’s founders have quietly announced that they have settled a long - standing lawsuit with a former colleague , while all eyes were on the launch of @entity7 ’s @entity6			1
chief executive @entity8 and chief technology officer @entity9 acknowledged that their former fraternity brother , @entity10 , was integral to the birth of their popular app , where 700 million disappearing messages are sent every day			2
the settlement comes just a fortnight after @entity1 was valued at £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion )			1
@entity1 's chief executive @entity8 ( pictured left ) and chief technology officer @entity9 ( right ) acknowledged that their former classmate , @entity10 , was integral to the birth of their popular app , from which 700 million disappearing messages are sent every day negotiations have been going on for a year - and - a - half			1
mr @entity10 originally came up with the idea for @entity1 – which sends disappearing photos – in 2011 when the three men were at @entity25			1
‘ he then collaborated with @entity8 and @entity9 on the development of @entity1 during its early and most formative days , ’ a statement issued by @entity1 explains			2
but mr @entity10 was later ousted and has been pushing for a favourable settlement			0
the final settlement resolves all disputes between the former students and is confidential , but a statement put out by @entity1 acknowledges that mr @entity10 came up with the concept for the app. ‘ @entity35 originally came up with the idea of creating an application for sending disappearing picture messages while he was a student at @entity25 , ’ the statement reads			1
mr @entity10 ( pictured ) originally came up with the idea for @entity1 - which sends disappearing photos - in 2011 when the three men were at @entity25 @entity40 recently launched a new ephemeral messaging app called @entity42 to compete with @entity1 the app , which functions in a similar way to @entity1 , allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend			1
like @entity1 , the user can tap on a friend 's face to instantly send a photo , or hold their finger down to send a video			2
however , @entity42 only allows you to send messages to one person at a time , which makes it frustrating if you ’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends			0
the favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends , though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total			0
@entity42 is currently only available in @entity72 , @entity73 , and @entity74			0
mr @entity8 said : ‘ we are pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter in a manner that is satisfactory to mr @entity10 and the @entity78			0
‘ we acknowledge @entity35 ’s contribution to the creation of @entity1 and appreciate his work in getting the application off the ground			1
’ in august last year , mr @entity10 unearthed photos , emails and other ' evidence ' in a bid to prove he was an integral part of @entity1 's success , but the other founders claimed he had ' no equity ' in the venture			1
it was reported at the time that he was suing the company for a third of its $ 800 million ( £ 496 million ) valuation			2
only the individuals involved know the financial outcome of the settlement , so it is impossible to speculate whether mr @entity10 received this figure , something lower , or a much higher settlement based on the company 's soaring valuation			2
mr @entity10 claimed he came up with the ghost logo and the original name , @entity109 , which the trio used in the launch of july that year			0
but the friends are said to have fallen out a month before @entity1 launched , arguably making mr @entity10 's role in the success of the final product slightly ambiguous			1
last year @entity1 turned down a £ 1.8 billion ( $ 3 billion ) offer from @entity118 , and while some doubted the app could grow further , the company was valued at a staggering £ 6 billion ( £ 10 billion ) two weeks ago			1
in a recent round of funding , investors promised millions to the company , including venture capital firm @entity126 & @entity127 , leading to the huge valuation , @entity121 reported			0
the venture - capital firm had committed to invest up to £ 12 million ( $ 20 million ) in @entity1 in may , the @entity121 cited one source as saying			1
if the deal goes through , @entity1 would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) or more , including car - ride service uber and rooms - to - let startup @entity137			1
@entity1 is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services , which may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users			2
it has also been rumoured that it may feature some sort of news service			0
this week it has debuted a new feature for @entity150 , featuring ' a live story ' with material from the @entity153 and @entity154 shows and street style photographers			0
though @entity1 and other similar mobile messaging apps do n't have established business models yet , their rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so			2
while the final settlement , which resolves all disputes between the former students , is confidential , a statement put out by @entity1 acknowledges that @entity10 came up with the concept for the app. @entity1 's humble beginnings began in a home in the @entity173 area of @entity174 in 2011 , @entity169 reported in the summer of last year			1
mr @entity10 , an @entity176 major , decided to spend the summer there at the home of mr @entity8 , his friend from @entity25			0
that is where mr @entity10 is said to have come up with the idea for the disappearing photo app. in the spring of 2013 , @entity1 now admits in the suit , mr @entity10 came up with the idea of a disappearing photo app. but that 's where the two parties ' stories part ways			1
mr @entity10 said that he and mr @entity191 looked for someone to write the code for their idea and chose mr @entity9			0
' from spring of 2011 and into the summer , ' reads @entity10 's filing , ' [ @entity10 ] and @entity8 and @entity9 lived , worked , developed and launched the application together			0
' a saved text conversation between mr @entity10 and mr @entity8 seems to back the claim and suggests that mr @entity10 helped to secure the company 's first patent , while another suggests the would - be app was a three man startup			0
in the summer of 2011 , things went sour between mr @entity8 , mr @entity9 and mr @entity10 , when the now famous startup founders reportedly changed the passwords to shut mr @entity10 out			0
last year , mr @entity10 claimed that he came up with the ghost logo and the original name , @entity109 , which the trio used in the launch of july that year .			0
