@entity1 is retaining its nearly 36 percent stake in @entity72			1
the handling of @entity1 's @entity4 stake is so important to shareholders that one activist investor , hedge fudge manager @entity94 of @entity95 , has threatened to spearhead an attempt to oust @entity88 if she did n't adopt a strategy that minimizes taxes			1
@entity94 also has been pressuring @entity88 to commit to returning most of any future @entity4 windfalls instead of spending the money to buy other companies — unless she embraces his call for @entity1 to merge with rival @entity105 a tax - free spin - off of the @entity4 stake ranked high on @entity94 's agenda			1
