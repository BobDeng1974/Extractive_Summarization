@entity16 ’s @entity9 community dates back to the post-war period when a building boom created a shortage of labour in the @entity16 brickworks industry			1

one firm , the @entity90 , established a recruitment office in @entity92 in 1951 and by the 1960s more than 7,500 @entity9 had arrived in the town			2

' a crowd spilt onto the @entity34 , which was closed in the interests of public safety			0
' unfortunately a group of approximately 150 people broke away and ran towards the @entity74 straight into grid - locked traffic as many @entity9 fans had formed a cavalcade of vehicles to celebrate and it was at this point some vehicles were attacked by the crowd			1
' he added : ' it is always a shame when the majority of well behaved supporters are let down by the actions of a mindless minority and while order was quickly restored this was undoubtedly an extremely unpleasant situation for people trying to leave the area sensibly and particularly for those stuck in their cars			0
