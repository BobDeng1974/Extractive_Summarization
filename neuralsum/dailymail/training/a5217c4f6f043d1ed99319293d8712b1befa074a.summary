but he said they had to respond to a housing crisis caused by an ageing population and uncontrolled immigration under the last @entity21 government			1
backbenchers said ministers had promised that they could decide where to build homes and draw up local plans			0
but they claimed developers were being allowed to ride roughshod over the wishes of local planners and foist housing developments on unsuitable areas			0
former planning minister sir @entity32 said four developments proposed in his @entity35 constituency were refused by the council , only to be given the green light by local government secretary @entity38			1
sir @entity32 said the decisions ‘ rode a coach and horses though protection for the @entity6 ’ , adding : ‘ this is not a sensible planning policy , this is planning anarchy			0
’ under threat : mr @entity3 has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of @entity52 must be built on to solve the crisis @entity54 , mp for @entity55 , said there was no shortage of homes in his constituency , but developers planned to build 50 per cent more within 20 years			1
he added : ‘ i question the government ’s assertion that they must built so very many houses that local authorities have to designate green - belt land to meet these arbitrary and as yet undefined housing targets			2

‘ that growth has two main sources			0
one is immigration , but the majority – about two thirds – is a result of ageing			0
' it used to be rare that there was a great grandparent in the family , now it is common			0
people are living longer and do n’t want to live in the same house			0
