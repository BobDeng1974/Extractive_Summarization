by @entity0 from crow ’s feet to drooping lids and crepey skin , ageing really affects our eyes			1
add thinning lashes , a common symptom of the menopause and suddenly what was your best feature is adding years to your face			1
at 53 , my eyelashes have not only thinned , but they appear shorter , leaving my eyes with no real definition			1
celeb fan : @entity20 is one of many female celebrities who have endorsed a range of false eyelashes add to that the dull complexion that so often strikes women of a certain age , and i feel thoroughly gloomy about my looks			1
my eyelashes are patchy and sparse in places			1
and as a blonde , without mascara you can barely tell they are there at all			1
so , could the false eyelashes that are such a staple in the older woman ’s make - up kit — celebrities such as @entity39 and @entity40 are rarely spotted without them — also help me ? previously , false lashes have always looked , well , false , but in the past few years , the technology has evolved			1
they ’re now lighter , easier to apply , and it ’s possible to choose an exact shape , style , colour and length of lash to suit your face			1
i put three of the leading lashes on offer to the test			1
@entity59 look : @entity60 looked great but were a little heavy i was excited about trying these , as they promised extra-thick lashes and a perfect line of eyeliner in one fell swoop — perfect for women like me whose hands are n’t steady enough to apply their own			1
like most ready - to - wear lashes , the strip had to be trimmed with nail scissors to the correct width of my eye			2
if the strip is too long , it will make your eye look droopy — the last thing i ’m looking for			2
usually , you trim any excess from the outside , but these must be trimmed from the inside , as the outer flick has been shaped into a thin point to elongate the eye			2
make sure you peel backing paper from the flick before applying glue to the whole strip from corner to corner , including the flick			2
i left the glue for 30 seconds , until it was tacky , before applying			2
once the lashes were on , they felt a little stiff , scratchy and heavy on my lids , but they gave a @entity98 , bright - eyed @entity99 look and they did n’t come loose with wear			2
score : 4/5 from £ 6.95 , laurensway.com @entity103 glue included			1
the only way is false : @entity20 's @entity105 lashes give a sophisticated and natural look the girls from tv show @entity109 are known for their huge , spidery lashes and these ones come from a range endorsed by @entity109 star @entity20			2
in the box , the strip of eyelashes looked thick and scarily long			1
but once on , i was blown away			0
the exaggerated outer flick gave a sophisticated look , which made me look glamorous , without being @entity119 - like			0
they looked natural , felt light and i did n’t have to hide the strip with any eyeliner			0
i forgot i was wearing them after a few minutes and they stayed firmly put			0
score : 4/5 from £ 2.74 , ardelllashes.com the winner : @entity127 lashes were so light @entity0 forgot she was wearing them ! there are 56 individual lashes in the box in a choice of short , medium or long , so you can create a bespoke look			1
i added five medium lashes to each eye , but you could use more for a dramatic look			0
it ’s a lot fiddlier than applying a strip , but worth the effort as the result is amazing			0
@entity143 recommends pouring a pea - size drop of adhesive on to a piece of tinfoil , before using tweezers to lift a lash from the tray and gently sweeping the base of the lash through the adhesive			0
then , using a magnifying mirror , i applied each lash over one of my own , as close to my lash roots as possible without touching my eyelid			0
i gently supported the lash with my fingertip for a few seconds until the adhesive set , working towards the outer corner of the eye			0
i then returned to the centre and worked inward until the lashes blended			0
for a natural look , use the longer lashes on the outside of your eye , and the shorter as you work towards the bridge of your nose			0
it took me 15 minutes to do both eyes , but it was worth the extra effort as they stay in place for up to two weeks			0
i absolutely loved the result			0
not only did they look natural , filling in sparse areas , but they were so light that i forgot i was wearing them			0
