the missing @entity0 dropped to as low as 12,000ft in what could have been a cabin emergency before it disappeared from the radar , it has emerged			1
as the exhaustive search continues in the @entity7 for the missing @entity8 , an official revealed the doomed passenger jet made a sharp turn over the @entity11 which ‘ seemed to be intentional ’			1
the plane 's last confirmed position , picked up by @entity15 military radar , was at 2.15am @entity15 time ( 1815 gmt march 7 ) about 200 nautical miles north - west of @entity15 's @entity18 island , roughly an hour after it diverted from its scheduled route from @entity21 to @entity22			0
@entity24 deputy prime minister , @entity23 , right , talks with @entity25 , left , senior search and rescue officer and mission coordinator for the search for the missing @entity30 aircraft radar specialists are pictured aboard a @entity35 @entity34 p - @entity33 aircraft searching for missing @entity0 over the southern @entity7 a @entity39 @entity38 exploration team member aboard @entity39 icebreaker @entity43 ( @entity42 ) searches for debris of missing @entity0 over the southern @entity7 ten aircraft including two from @entity47 and two from @entity39 have bolstered the ongoing search effort in the @entity7 , where possible debris from missing @entity30 flight @entity52 was spotted radar tracking shows the aircraft changed altitude after making the ‘ intentional ’ sharp left turn as it headed toward the @entity57 , a source close to the investigation said			1
the anonymous official , who is not authorised to speak to the media , told @entity62 that flying at 12,000 feet in the heavily trafficked air corridor would ’ve kept the missing jet out of sight of other aircraft			2
@entity67 , an aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity70 @entity69 , told the international broadcaster the new information was ‘ highly significant ’			1
she said : ‘ it explains so many pieces that did n't fit together before			0
‘ now , if we have a scenario where something happened , the plane made a dramatic turn and dropped from 35,000 feet to 12,000 feet , this scenario would fit what a pilot would do in the event of a catastrophic on - board event , such as a rapid decompression , a fire , an explosion			2
‘ that 's what you would have to do , descend , get down and turn around and try to get back to an airport that could accommodate an ailing plane			0
’ it raises questions over what might have happened in the plane ’s cockpit to cause such a drop in altitude			0
however , it is not yet clear how long it took the plane to descend to 12,000 feet , which officials will now be desperate to uncover			0
@entity105 , rescue coordination chief , left , looks over the maps of the @entity7 with @entity107 , manager of search and rescue operations at the @entity110 's rescue coordination centre in @entity111 a relative of @entity39 passengers aboard the missing @entity30 , @entity52 , expresses her frustration at the lack of information , to journalists in @entity22 @entity24 's deputy prime minister @entity23 says the search operation is ' clutching ' at new information after it was revealed new @entity122 satellite images were taken 850km from the current target zone the new information comes after @entity122 said it was investigating a possible sighting of debris in the south @entity7			1
officials are hoping the new data will help them solve the disappearance of the plane , which went missing with 239 people on board on march 8 , and has quickly become one of the world 's great aviation mysteries			1
@entity122 's @entity135 said yesterday that a satellite image taken 850 kilometres from the current search site in the @entity7 indicated floating debris in the water			1
satellite images previously issued by @entity24 and @entity39 have proved futile in the search so far with @entity39 officials withdrawing their data last week after admitting to ‘ mistakenly ’ releasing it			1
and search planes have so far failed to locate two objects that @entity24 said it had identified in the @entity7 , about 1,500 miles south east of @entity147			1
however , the new information from @entity122 has promoted authorities to widen the search area in the hunt for the doomed airliner			1
the @entity110 's rescue coordination centre said the search area was expanded from 59,000 to 68,500 square kilometres ( 22,800 - 26,400 square miles ) to include the new separate area uncovered by the @entity122 data			1
a photo released by @entity39 broadcaster cctv shows a satellite image of a large floating object in the @entity7 that could be related to missing @entity0 commanding officer of @entity161 , captain @entity162 of the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) , scans the ocean from the ship 's bridge during the search for the missing @entity52 in the @entity7 it comes amid concerns of rain hampering the search , which has been buoyed by the addition of two @entity39 @entity174 planes , increasing the number of aircraft involved from eight to 10			1
there are also concerns about @entity179 bearing down on the @entity24 northwest coast which @entity24 's deputy prime minister @entity23 said ‘ could stir up less favourable weather ’			2
the search could deteriorate rapidly this morning , with rain forecast in in the search area , about 2,500 kilometres ( 1,550 miles ) southwest of @entity147			1
officials will be worried about bad weather hindering the search , especially after minister @entity23 described sunday as a ‘ fruitless day ’ which delivered ‘ nothing of note ’			0
he said : ' it is a very difficult task			0
' the weather yesterday was n't too bad , although there was early morning fog			0
' today we expect the weather to deteriorate and of course the forecasts ahead are not all that good			0
' so it 's going to be a challenge but we 'll stick at it			0
' he also described the search operation as ' clutching ' at information , as flight and sea crews prepared to embark on their fifth day of sweeps in the target zone some 2,500km off the coast of @entity147			1
acting prime minister of australia @entity23 speaks to the media at the @entity212 , where he said the search for @entity52 would continue ' while there 's still hope ' and until officials were certain it was ' futile ' mr @entity23 walks with @entity218 wing commander @entity217 and @entity220 captain @entity219 : mr @entity23 dismissed a suggestion the @entity222 had waited too long to act after revealing the satellite photos a royal australia @entity34 @entity224 leaves @entity226 in search of @entity52			2
the flight went missing more than two weeks ago carrying 239 passengers and crew on route from @entity21 to @entity22 ' the @entity122 sighting is a piece of new material because that is in a completely different location			1
that is about 850 kilometres north of our current search area , ' mr @entity23 told @entity240			2
' that 's not in the area that had been identified as the most likely place where the aircraft may have entered the sea			2
but having said all that we 've got to check out all the options			0
' we 're just , i guess , clutching at whatever little piece of information comes along to try and find a place where we might be able to concentrate the efforts			0
' today 's search , bolstered by 10 aircraft , including three civil planes , two @entity174 aircraft from @entity39 and two @entity257 from @entity47 , has been split into two areas within the same proximity of the southern @entity7 covering 22,800sq miles			2
the @entity110 said the aircraft will also search for possible objects in an area about 2,500 kilometres ( 1,550 miles ) southwest of @entity147			0
@entity15 authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet , but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across @entity15 to the @entity57 , with its communications systems disabled			0
they are unsure what happened next			0
police are considering the possibilities of hijacking , sabotage , terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board .			0
