a @entity2 family of wheat growers felt so at home among the 30 - foot bins that hold their harvested crops , they moved into one			1
@entity8 and @entity9 saw more than just vessels for their grain in the galvanized steel cylinders that dotted their @entity15 farm , they saw a cozy opportunity			1
so , in 2001 , the couple renovated one of their bins -- which measure just 42 - feet in diameter -- to become a two - bedroom , two - story home complete with all the amenities a prairie home might need			2
little grain bin on the prairie : a @entity2 family turned this 42 - foot in diameter grain bin into a unique and cozy home unique problems : the 31 - foot tall grain bin was converted into a home in 2001 by wheat farmers @entity9 and @entity34			1
here is a view from their dining room which shows the double - doored foyer , built that way to kep the prairie dust out of their home galvanizing : mr. and mrs. @entity34 are pictured on their porch swing			0
the couple say upkeep on the outdoor walls and roof of their home takes zero effort thanks to their galvanized steel covering one of them , as pointed out in a segment on the unique home that aired on @entity56 , is unique to the prairie and visitors encounter it just as soon as they arrive : a double - door foyer designed to keep out the dust of the plains out of the home			1
also downstairs are a surprisingly modern kitchenette , two conference rooms where the @entity67 conduct farm business , a bathroom and a utility room			0
up a contemporary set of steel stairs is the home 's second floor , where both its bedrooms and a second bath are located			0
the look of the decor is both modern and folksy : sleek kitchen cabinets are finished with animal antler handles ; a ceiling fan sports clear plastic blades where it hangs from the wooden - slatted ceiling ; animal furs are slung over the steel staircase			2
high concept : being a grain bin , the roof is tall -- 31 feet to be precise			0
this gives the interior a unique and vaulted look view from above : looking down , the circular home looks almost like a lighthouse ... one without a light that was built to hold 25,000 bushels of grain mixed metal : instead of the cold , galvanized steel , the @entity67 covered the ceilings in wooden slats with copper trim though there was only room for a galley style kitchen , the @entity2 home was built with round rooms that give a feeling of roominess for more videos , please go to @entity56 and to complement the home 's circular structure , how else to construct each cozy room but round ? ' we wanted round rooms in a round house , so this is what we came up with , ' @entity34 told @entity56 's you live in @entity120 ? while odd , the structure 's non-tradition materials come with perks			1
for instance , with galvanized steel adorning the entire facade and roof , they require zero upkeep			1
there were challenges , though			0
specifically , they had to think outside the box to put a rectangular porch and balcony on the totally circular home			0
despite the head - scratching moments , all the typical amenities are in the home , which has central heat , central air , wall - to - wall carpet and running water			0
' we wanted round rooms in a round house , so this is what we came up with , ' @entity34 told @entity56 's you live in @entity120 ? cozy : the upstairs of the home has two bedrooms and a bathroom farm bills : the downstairs features two conference areas where the @entity67 can conduct farm business			2

@entity8 and @entity9 saw a cozy opportunity within the 31 - foot galvanized steel structure on their @entity15 wheat farm
