when @entity1 won his first @entity3 call - up in november , he had just enjoyed a run of six goals in five games for @entity7 and was on the back page of every national newspaper for the right reasons			1
just two months on and the sulky striker refused to celebrate any of his four goals during saturday ’s 7 - 0 victory over @entity15 in the third round of the @entity17			1
@entity1 ( second left ) was in a sulky mood as he scored four goals in the @entity17 third round so what has upset the @entity7 frontman ? well , he did n’t make it off the bench with @entity3 for starters			1
we all expected to see @entity1 win his first @entity3 cap in either the @entity28 with @entity29 or the friendly in @entity31			2
@entity32 , though , chose not to introduce the 21 - year - old and it remains to be seen whether he will be included in the next full squad			0
why is that ? it later emerged that he had been arrested on suspicion of drink - driving in october , two days after scoring for @entity7 in a 2 - 2 draw with @entity41			2
it was alleged he was driving at speeds of up to 110mph			0
if charged and found guilty , @entity1 could face a penalty of up to six months in prison , a £ 5,000 fine and a driving ban of at least one year			0
@entity1 was called up by @entity3 manager @entity32 in november but did not earn his first cap @entity1 celebrates scoring against @entity49 at @entity50 on @entity51 how has he performed since ? he did not score for @entity7 until the @entity51 draw at @entity49 and went 11 matches without a goal			1
in that time his form dipped and , with the team struggling , manager @entity55 was sacked			0
what about his contract ? @entity1 – who earns £ 12,000 a week - was in line for an improved deal in light of his scoring start to the campaign and promotion to the @entity3 senior ranks			1
those talks , however , have been put on hold			0
the striker was in blistering form at the start of the season , scoring six goals in five games for @entity7 do @entity7 risk losing him ? there has been talk of @entity78 making a £ 25m approach for the @entity81 - born frontman and it is thought new boss @entity82 could well be willing to cash in as he looks to bring in his own players in their fight against relegation			1
so what was his problem at the weekend ? @entity1 scored four for the first time in his career but was in no mood to celebrate			0
he later insisted he was simply ‘ acting professionally ’ and said there was no need to explain himself to reporters			0
what now ? all is clearly not well and the suggestion that @entity7 could listen to offers for @entity1 may well trigger a january approach from @entity78 , especially given his contract situation			1
he has 13 goals this season and would not be short of suitors should it become clear that he is available for transfer			0
@entity1 could well be on his way out of @entity106 if @entity78 make an offer			2

@entity1 did not celebrate any of his four goals against @entity15
@entity1 had been on an 11 - match goal *drought* until @entity51
@entity78 are *interested* in signing him and @entity7 may sell
