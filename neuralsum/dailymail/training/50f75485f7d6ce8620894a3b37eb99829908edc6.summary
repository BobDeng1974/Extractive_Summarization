@entity1 return to @entity2 on saturday seven months after wrecking the @entity4 's title dream , with @entity6 's players promising a lesson in how to handle the pressure of title race			1
a prickly media exchange between @entity6 and @entity13 , friends and colleagues turned foes , followed the clash last april when the @entity17 boss accused the @entity18 of ' parking two buses ' and said it was ' not difficult ' to coach a team to defend in numbers			1
@entity13 eventually sent a conciliatory message to his former mentor , but he must have been bruised by the defeat			2
perhaps , in some ways , his team are still feeling the effects			0
they have won only seven of 18 since			0
@entity6 ( left ) and @entity1 ruined @entity17 's title dream last season in a spiky encounter @entity35 's slip allowed @entity36 to race through and score the opening goal in a 2 - 0 victory @entity36 's strike changed the complexion of the game and allowed @entity1 to pick @entity17 off on the counter with the defeat @entity17 blew their big chance to win a @entity46 title for the first time since 1990 and @entity1 midfielder @entity48 has stoked the fires again ahead of saturday lunchtime 's re-run , with an apparent jibe at @entity17 's attitude after last season 's encounter			1
' nobody 's happy when you lose a game and they were n't happy after that game , ' said @entity48			2
' many teams have tried to park the bus in front of the goal against us , but we win			0
if you defend you have to know how to defend			0
it was 2 - 0			0
we showed we have quality			0
' @entity17 were top of the @entity46 in april , closing in on a first title since 1990 , when @entity6 sent out a weakened team in a fixture which preceded a @entity74 semi-final			1
it was a clash laced with enmity , with @entity1 upset the game had not been moved to help their preparations for @entity79 and @entity13 angry with @entity6 's defensive tactics			1
this time , the @entity18 are top of the league , unbeaten in 17 games this season and confident they can extend that against a @entity17 team , which has spluttered since they sold @entity84			1
' it is a different story , ' said @entity48			0
we are first and we want to stay there			0
we will play a different way and i 'm very happy because we will play one big game on saturday			2
' @entity91 defender @entity48 ( left ) has had a dig at @entity17 ahead of the meeting between the sides @entity48 , celebrating with @entity95 , heads for @entity2 after scoring @entity1 's goal against @entity97 @entity1 will be full strength , without distractions			1
they will adopt different tactics and are determined not to stumble as @entity17 did in april			1
' it was three games to go , they were fighting for the title and they wanted to win , ' said @entity95			2
they struggled in a must - win			0
last season was completely different			2
' now we are going there on top of the table			0
we know it 's difficult but also our team knows how to win there			2
it will be very exciting			0
we know what we have to do			0
we have a lot of things to do to be successful and get points from @entity2			2
' ' we know what we have to do , ' says @entity95 ( left ) as @entity1 prepare to face @entity17 on saturday this is a fierce modern rivalry which first emerged from the sparring between @entity6 and @entity124 a decade ago and has been well and truly reignited by that clash in april , when @entity1 's second string halted an 11 - match winning streak , stunned @entity2 and opened the door for @entity130 to be champions			1
@entity35 's slip for the first goal , scored by @entity36 , now features in a popular song and @entity84 has stirred emotions by writing in his book that one @entity1 player had told him he was ashamed of @entity6 's time - wasting tactics			1
@entity95 would not address the @entity84 allegations when asked , after the draw in @entity97 on wednesday			0
@entity84 left a mark on last season 's clash - saying one @entity1 player was ashamed of @entity6 's tactics the atmosphere will sizzle on saturday lunchtime			1
@entity17 are 12 points adrift of their visitors after 10 games but will take great satisfaction if they can end @entity1 's unbeaten start to this campaign			1
complaints have been rumbling inside @entity154 as @entity17 have enjoyed an extra day to recover from a @entity155 away game , when @entity13 rested first - team players in a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity159			1
@entity6 's squad returned from a 1 - 1 draw against @entity97 , in @entity162 , in the early hours of thursday morning and will fly to @entity163 after training on friday but the players have their minds fixed on another positive result			1
' it 's one of the massive , crucial games for us , ' said @entity95			0
' for this kind of game you always have to find extra motivation and it 's not about the tightness or fitness			2
' we have two days to recover , this is usual and it 's not our first time to play that			0
we know and we are professional , and we have to do a lot of things to be ready for that game			0
' @entity185 ( right ) and @entity35 started on the bench for @entity17 in the midweek @entity74 tie against @entity159 as @entity13 planned for saturday 's encounter with @entity1			1
