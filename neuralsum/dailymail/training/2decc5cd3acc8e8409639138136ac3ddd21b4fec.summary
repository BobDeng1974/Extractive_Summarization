a producer at the humiliated @entity2 tv station which published a series of fake and racially offensive names supposedly of the pilots on - board the crashed @entity7 flight , captured the moment he realized their mistake tweeting simply ‘ oh * * * t ’ according to the @entity15 , @entity12 , a producer with seven years experience at @entity14 , revealed his embarrassment on the social networking site yesterday , just moments after an anchor in all seriousness read four ' names ' including captain @entity22			1
it is unclear whether @entity12 - who cites ordering video and writing scripts among his responsibilities at the network - was in charge of the broadcast , but his two word response and entire @entity32 profile was deleted moments later			2
presenter @entity47 announced that the station had just learned the names of the four pilots who were on board @entity7 when it crashed at @entity53 on saturday			1
she then proceeded to read out four fake names from a teleprompter as they appeared on screen over footage of the wreckage			2
the names poked fun at the crash and have been further criticized for their racist undertones			0
the first name — ' captain @entity22 ' might have been a giveaway that something was not quite right			0
however , with the camera 's rolling and in the middle of a live broadcast , ms. @entity47 continued to read without so much as flinching : ' @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73			0
' it is not yet clear where the names , which mock the tragedy which killed three , originated			0
the broadcaster said they came from a source who they were refusing to identify			0
they also tried to justify the move saying they confirmed the names with the @entity42 before airing them			1
the safety board admitted a summer intern told @entity14 the spelling of the names was correct			1
the broadcaster said they never checked the position of the employee in the organisation and rushed to get the names into their lunchtime broadcast			1
on his evening newscast , anchor @entity98 apologized further			0
' first , we never read the names out loud , phonetically sounding them out , ' he said			0
' then , during our phone call to the @entity42 where the person confirmed the spellings of the names , we never asked that person to give us their position with the agency			1
' we heard this person verify the information without questioning who they were and then rushed the names on our noon newscast			1
' in a statement the @entity42 admitted a summer intern had ' erroneously ' confirmed the names of the flight crew and was ' acting outside the scope of his authority ' in doing so			1
' the @entity42 apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of @entity7 , which crashed at @entity53 on july 6 , ' the @entity42 said in a statement			1
' earlier today , in response to an inquiry from a media outlet , a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft , ' it added			1
days earlier , @entity14 news director @entity137 was crowing about how good his news operation had performed			1
' being first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a great accomplishment , but being 100 % accurate , effectively using our great sources and social media without putting a single piece of erroneous information on our air , is what we are most proud of as a newsroom			0
' the station issued a statement on friday afternoon acknowledging it had ' misidentified the pilots involved			0
' third victim : a @entity2 hospital says a third victim of a plane crash , a @entity161 girl , has died from her injuries			0
she was among about a dozen injured still in hospital after @entity7 crashed as it approached the airport too low last week in an - online apology , @entity14 general manager @entity167 wrote : ' we sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize , both in the newscast where the mistake occurred , as well as on our website and social media sites			1
nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity , and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again			0
' however , the apologies from @entity14 and the @entity42 have done little to abate anger over the issue			1
@entity186 , president of the @entity187 , said in a statement : ' those names were not only wrong , but so grossly offensive that it ’s hard for us at the @entity187 to fathom how those names made it on the broadcast			2
' with such a vaunted reputation among local news stations , we expected much more from @entity14			2
we fail to understand how those obviously phony names could escape detection before appearing on the broadcast and were spoken by the news anchor			2
we urge @entity14 to conduct a thorough review to prevent similar lapses			2
' ' @entity187 is embarrassed for the anchor of the noon broadcast , who was as much a victim as @entity14 ’s viewers and @entity14 ’s hard - working staff , including the journalists who produced stellar work covering the crash			1
' ' but we ’re mostly saddened that a tragedy that took the lives of three people and injured scores of other passengers could be taken as an opportunity for an apparent joke			0
' another unidentified teen has died of her injuries bring the death toll in the tragic crash up to three			0
a further 180 people were injured , many serious			0
based in @entity225 , @entity226 , the @entity224 affiliate represents a city where 16.8 % of the population is @entity229			0
@entity14 also broadcasts in two heavily @entity229 - populated communities : @entity2 , where @entity231 make up 33.3 % of the total population and @entity233 , where 32 % of the population is @entity229			2
@entity14 ’s false report comes after a week of speculating whether last week 's disastrous @entity236 crash could be attributed to @entity238 ' culture ' and whether @entity240 ’s tradition of deference to hierarchy could have played a role in the crash			2
broken news : anchor @entity47 read the names off the teleprompter and did n't bat an eye , adding that the information had been confirmed by the @entity42 @entity236 has identified two of the four flying crew on board as the pilot and copilot @entity256 - kook and @entity257 - min. coverage of the tragic plane crash at @entity53 , which killed three people and injured dozens of others last saturday has proven tricky for some news outlets			1
earlier this week , the @entity263 apologized for its front page headline ' fright 214 , ' which was criticized for sounding like a stereotype of an @entity229 accent .			0

@entity268 broadcast inaccurate names but apologized for the error a few minutes later
@entity14 says it confirmed the information with the @entity42
@entity42 says a summer intern verified the names when approached by the station
