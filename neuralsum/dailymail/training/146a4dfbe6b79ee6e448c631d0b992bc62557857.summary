@entity0 has said many @entity2 players fail at the top level because they are paid too much , too young in comparison to their peers from other countries			1
the @entity8 manager , whose side take on @entity10 in their opening @entity13 game on sunday , thinks being part of the most high - profile league in the world , combined with the premium placed on @entity2 players by agents and clubs , is distorting young players ’ expectations and killing their hunger			1
@entity0 made the points whilst discussing 19 - year - old @entity25 , insisting it is important the player is rewarded in a proportionate manner , to ensure he does not follow previous generations which have failed to develop after securing their first multi-million pound contract			1
please do n’t be putting too much on the @entity2 players and @entity45 players because they get rewarded and i think that ’s partly what kills them in this country			1
‘ we ’re very happy here with the way we deal with the young players — we reward them			1
@entity25 is a kid who has propelled himself on to another level again			2
he got rewarded for that , and that will always be the case here with all the players			0
‘ but we just have to be careful because when you reward young players too quickly , you give them too much , too early , then that will be their downfall			2
there ’s no doubt he ’s at a real good level			0
too hot to handle : @entity67 defender @entity66 resorts to grabbing @entity25 to stop him ‘ it ’s a big problem with @entity2 players , a massive problem in this country and i see it with the @entity2 players in particular			1
why ? because the reward is no longer there , they lose their hunger			0
@entity76 players buy a new @entity77 before they have even got their driving licence			2
‘ we have been able to keep him [ @entity80 ] grounded			0
he ’s a very wealthy young man as he stands at 19			0
‘ that wealth i am sure will continue over the next few years because of his talent , which is getting better all the time			0
