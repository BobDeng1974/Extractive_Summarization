@entity0 is close to completing his £ 16million switch to @entity2 from @entity3 as the @entity4 continue to bolster their squad ahead of the new season			1
as @entity9 homes in on finalising a deal for the highly rated left - back , @entity7 gives you a rundown on the 22 - year - old in demand			1
he has played three times for @entity18 and is rated as one of the most talented players in his position in @entity30			2
@entity0 made 40 appearances last season and was part of the @entity3 side that won the @entity35			0
have @entity2 been watching him for long ? yes , they have had their eye on @entity0 for some time now			0
a deal looked close at the beginning of the summer but @entity2 baulked at @entity3 ’s £ 20m asking price , valuing the player in the region of £ 14m			0
competition : @entity18 defender @entity0 ( left ) is expected to vie with @entity43 for @entity2 's left - back spot so why have they gone back in for @entity0 ? @entity46 emerged as the prime target but @entity48 were reluctant to do business with a potential title rival and the player also wanted to be guaranteed first - team football , as he will be on loan at @entity54 this season			1
can we expect the deal to be wrapped up soon ? @entity2 chief executive @entity58 is understood to be travelling to @entity18 this weekend to seal the deal			0
a compromise of around £ 16m is thought to have been reached between @entity2 and @entity3			0
why have @entity2 been so keen to draft in a left back ? it has emerged as a problem position for @entity4 boss @entity9			1
@entity63 suffered a long - term injury last season but some had already questioned his credentials as an elite - level full back			1
@entity70 ’s loan spell was erratic and he has returned to @entity71			0
@entity43 , 21 , will provide stiff competition for @entity0 though			2
unconvincing : @entity63 's ( left ) credentials have been called into question			2

@entity18 *international* close to sealing £ 16million switch to @entity78
@entity43 expected to compete with @entity0 for left - back starting role
@entity63 *future* in doubt as @entity9 continues to *strengthen* @entity86 club
