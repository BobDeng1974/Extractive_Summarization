@entity0 crashed out of @entity1 , beaten on away goals by 10 - man @entity3 and branded ' babies ' by @entity6			1
@entity8 's team led twice in this turbulent encounter but twice allowed @entity3 to level , with captain @entity10 heading the vital second , six minutes from the end of extra-time			1
@entity6 , dismissed for a tackle on @entity16 in the first - half , said : ' i do n't know if i have to get angry or start to laugh			1
for me when i saw the red card i was like " the guy does n't know what he 's doing "			1
' that is not the worst			0
the worst is when i got the red card all the @entity0 players come around			1
it felt like i had a lot of babies around me			0
' @entity0 players surround referee @entity28 as the @entity29 sends off @entity6 ( far right ) on 31 minutes @entity6 heads into a challenge with @entity0 midfielder @entity16 ( left ) in the first - half which saw him sent off the @entity3 forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with @entity16 @entity0 captain @entity38 ( left ) reacts after @entity6 's tackle on @entity16 in the first - half at @entity40 @entity8 said he hoped the red card could be overturned but also bemoaned a penalty not given for a trip on @entity44 and what he thought might be an elbow on @entity44 by @entity48			1
the @entity0 manager also blamed his own players for failing to deal with their numerical advantage , wilting under expectations and conceding twice from set - pieces			1
' when a team can not defend two corners a team does n't deserve to win , ' said @entity8			1
' we could n't cope with the pressure			0
for them it was easy , two lines of four , counter-attack , waiting for the right moment			0
mentally for them with 10 there is nothing to lose			0
@entity0 players look dejected after being dumped out of the @entity67 at home to @entity3 ' our performance was not good enough			1
the opponent was stronger than us , they coped better with the pressure of the game			2
because they had 10 men we felt more the pressure of winning and they had nothing to lose			0
' we could n't cope with that , we conceded two goals in two set pieces			2
that is difficult to accept			0
for me it was a surprise			0
i am disappointed , but i try always to be pragmatic and honest			2
the first feeling was that we deserved to lose			0
we did n't deserve to go through			0
' it 's not the moment to explain			2
we have a @entity88 to win			0
i told that to the players			0
we lost a competition where even if we win today there are other big teams to beat			0
' we have the @entity88 to win and we are in a good situation			0
there 's no time to cry			2
move on , and look forward			0
' former @entity0 man @entity48 gestures towards @entity98 striker @entity44 during wednesday 's encounter @entity3 defender @entity48 celebrated excitedly after scoring against his former club at @entity40 @entity10 's late header loops over the outstretched arm of @entity103 to knock @entity0 out on @entity6 's red card , @entity8 said : ' i spoke to him after the game and when he speaks with me he 's always honest			1
he would tell me if it was a reason for a red card , and he was very disappointed so if that 's the case , i hope they can minimise the mistake and let him play the quarter - final			1
if he did nothing wrong , he deserves that			0
' but the other situations , it was a clear penalty on @entity44 and , once more , i think it 's a waste of time and money to have the officials on the side of the goal			2
if he can not see a penalty 10 metres when it 's completely clear , it 's a waste of time and money			2
' the @entity48 elbow i did n't see , i confess			0
but when @entity127 give him the man of the match , i have to believe there 's no elbow			2
perhaps they can not give us the penalty but maybe they can do what is fair and suspend @entity48 and take @entity6 into the quarter - finals			1
' @entity6 also suggested @entity16 feigned injury			1
' i pulled out ( of the tackle ) , because i saw him come in the tackle			0
' i do n't know if he was acting afterwards			0
we won the game , we went through and let 's see what happens			1
' @entity0 manager @entity8 says he hopes @entity6 is able to have his red card overturned it was ill - tempered with @entity148 pundits @entity149 and @entity150 very critical of the behaviour by @entity8 's players , especially their attempts to get @entity6 sent off			1
@entity149 called it ' disgraceful ' and @entity150 called it ' pathetic '			0

@entity159 restored the lead with a penalty in extra-time , after handball by @entity10 , who then headed in the winner with six minutes of extra-time left			1
' it is amazing for everyone , amazing for @entity168 the club , for @entity168 the city , ' said @entity48 , who left @entity40 for the @entity172 capital last year			0
' my cycle was finished at @entity0 and @entity3 gave me a great opportunity to continue my career			1
' i was very happy at @entity0 , i respect everyone and it was good to score			1
i said i would n't celebrate but i could n't control my emotions			0
thank you to @entity0 , and sorry i celebrated because i was so emotional			1
' the @entity88 will be without a team in the last eight of the @entity67 for the second time in three years if @entity182 and @entity183 can not overturn first - leg deficits next week against @entity185 and @entity186 respectively but @entity3 boss @entity187 was satisfied to make it into the quarter - finals after this fierce contest			1
‘ both sides put pressure on the opposition and @entity0 did their fair share of that			1
it had happened even before the match with their manager exerting pressure on the referee			2
that ’s part of the mind games			0
but if you take out these elements of unsporting behaviour , i think my team were better than @entity0 in every area of the pitch , ’ he said			2
