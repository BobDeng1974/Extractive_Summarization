' we , and thousands of supporters across the world , are heartbroken and frustrated that these slowly dying bears are not given the dignity of rescue and where necessary peaceful euthanasia after all they 've suffered on the farms			2
' for pity 's sake , we implore the prime minister to release them from their pain , confiscate them in to our sanctuary , and allow our team to give them the love and care they deserve			0
