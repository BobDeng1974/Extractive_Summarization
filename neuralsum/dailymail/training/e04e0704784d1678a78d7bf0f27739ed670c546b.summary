by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 03:19 est , 12 march 2013 promises : @entity2 suggested he would never cut the @entity4 budget while he is prime minister @entity2 yesterday suggested he would never cut the @entity4 budget while he is prime minister			1
he made the claim as he came under pressure from all sides to lift the protection from spending cuts currently given to health , schools and foreign aid			1
in an unlikely alliance , @entity13 business secretary @entity13 and leading @entity15 right - winger @entity14 joined forces to insist the government ’s budget ‘ ring - fences ’ were unsustainable			1
a think - tank report today warns that health alone will account for 22.5 per cent of the total increase in spending between 2011 - 12 and 2014 - 15			1
but the prime minister insisted he would not countenance cutting health spending			2
and despite a growing @entity28 revolt , @entity26 said the special protections for schools and foreign aid would also be extended in the next spending review , to cover @entity19 expenditure for 2015 - 16			2
‘ when you look particularly at the @entity4 , you know that we have got an ageing population			2
there is massive pressure on the @entity4 , more expensive treatments and drugs are coming through , and i just do n’t believe it is practical or right to cut the @entity4 , ’ mr @entity2 said			0
‘ there are many good suggestions coming from many quarters			0
as prime minister i am never short of advice			0
but there ’s one piece of advice i wo n’t take and that ’s the piece of advice that says you ought to cut the @entity4 budget			2
‘ we made a very clear promise before the last election that yes , we were going to have to take difficult decisions , yes we were going to have to make some very difficult and painful cuts , but we would n’t cut the @entity4 budget			2
i think it ’s really important for people to know that			0
’ he added : ‘ i do n’t deny for one moment we ’ve had to take difficult decisions ; we are in a tough economic environment			0
i want people to know as we go through that tough economic environment the @entity4 is going to be there for them			0
in an unlikely alliance , @entity13 business secretary @entity13 and leading @entity15 right - winger @entity14 joined forces to insist the government ’s budget ‘ ring - fences ’ were unsustainable ‘ the @entity4 is not going to be cut by this government			1
’ but dr @entity14 , the former defence secretary who is tipped for a return to the @entity28 , suggested there should be a public spending freeze of between three and five years , and challenged mr @entity2 ’s decision to protect certain budgets			1
‘ we must also ask whether ring - fencing departmental budgets makes sense in a period of prolonged austerity , ’ he said			1
he also backed mr @entity13 ’s call for pensioner benefits , such as the winter fuel allowance , free bus pass and tv licence , to be reviewed			1
on ring - fencing the business secretary yesterday warned : ‘ it means that all future pressures then come on things like the @entity91 , the police , local government , skills and universities			1
so you get a very unbalanced approach to public spending			0
’ a report from the centre - right think - tank reform says today that the ring - fences on key areas of spending mean chancellor @entity102 was operating ‘ with one hand tied behind his back ’			1
it said the prime minister could not reasonably continue to rule out reducing spending on the @entity4 , pensioner benefits and schools			0
@entity111 , senior economist at @entity98 , said : ‘ the @entity113 ’s problems with overspending will not be addressed without a new approach			0
' the problems facing the public finances are structural and they require structural solutions			0
