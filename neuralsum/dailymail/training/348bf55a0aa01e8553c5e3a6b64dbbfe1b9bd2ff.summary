for almost a year and a half workers had been constructing a bridge to cross the main @entity2 that runs between @entity3 and @entity4 , but it took just minutes to bring the entire structure crashing to the ground			1
the blaze began after a construction workers ' blowtorch was fanned by strong winds and ignited the wooden scaffolding that was being used to build the new flyover , across @entity2 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
driven by high winds , the fire took hold extremely quickly and began burning the supports surrounding the bridge			2
debris began to fell onto the @entity23 - 15 minutes after the fire began , the road was eventually closed to traffic at 1:30pm yesterday as the $ 32 million construction project slowly turned into a pile of ash and twisted metal			1
the blaze , which burned through the night , reduced the bridge 's wooden support structure to ash and caused steel girders to sag into the freeway below closed : the construction at @entity2 was engulfed in flames on monday			1
the bridge at @entity59 caught fire at about 1:30 p.m. and @entity2 was closed soon after because of falling debris crews used heavy equipment to slowly drag collapsed remnants out of lanes traffic on the northbound side of @entity15 's main connector to @entity4 could be flowing again by mid-to - late afternoon on tuesday it all happened so fast that some builders continued to remain on site , completely unaware that flames were licking at the structure just feet away from them			1
incredibly , nobody was hurt during the dramatic collapse although one worker was taken to hospital after suffering from the effects of breathing in smoke			0
the road is expected to remain closed in both directions until this evenings ' commute at the earliest however officials are hopeful that all lanes will be open by wednesday morning			1
in the meantime , officials have told drivers to stay away from from the @entity89			0
on monday evening , enormous traffic jams built up including with traffic backing up 6 miles to the south and up to 20 miles to the north			0
up in smoke : more than a years worth of construction effort went up in flames as the bridge collapsed demolished : the fire spread across the bridge which was as big as a football field overnight : firefighters spent much of the night dampening down the flames commuters were urged to find alternate routes			1
southbound lanes are expected to reopen by wednesday morning dozens of firefighters battled the blaze in windy conditions , with limited access to water , and high danger that the wooden skeleton of the football - field - sized bridge would collapse the blaze , which burned through the night , reduced the bridge 's wooden support structure to ash and caused steel girders to sag into the freeway below			1
crews used heavy equipment to slowly drag collapsed remnants out of lanes			0
dozens of firefighters battled the blaze in windy conditions , with limited access to water , and high danger that the wooden skeleton of the football - field - sized bridge would collapse on top of them			2

traffic on the northbound side of @entity15 's main connector to @entity4 could be flowing again by mid-to - late afternoon on tuesday cause : a construction worker 's torch was picked up by the high winds in the area and set the bridge on fire			1
the daylong firefight was tough because flames were in areas that were hard to get to under the bridge and there was danger of a collapse now look what you 've done ! the blaze was started when a construction worker 's blowtorch accidentally ignited the wooden supports of the @entity59 overpass bridge by monday night most flames were out aside from some smoldering ; firefighters remained on site throughout the night @entity136 crews worked into the evening demolishing remnants of the wooden skeleton of the bridge , which had been under construction since early 2013 when the fire erupted , @entity136 contractors were still working on top of the bridge and unaware of the blaze until being evacuated by firefighters because the flames were being pushed away by the wind traffic on the northbound side of @entity15 's main connector to @entity4 could be flowing again by mid-to - late afternoon , said @entity185 , district 8 director for @entity136			1
southbound lanes are expected to reopen by wednesday morning , he said			2
when the fire erupted , a number of @entity136 contractors were still working on top of the bridge and unaware of the blaze until they were told to evacuate by firefighters as the flames were being pushed away by the wind			2
' the @entity89 is going to be a nightmare for the next 24 to 48 hours at least , ' @entity194 said			0
' so if at all possible , avoid it altogether , because there is just no way they 're going to open it any time soon			0
' it 's recommended that drivers use alternate routes including interstates 138 and 18			0
ruined : debris from the @entity207 project remains draped over the @entity2			0
this bridge was just one part of a 59 million dollar project to improve transportation in the area clearing the clutter : a contractor cuts steel re-bar as the remains of the @entity59 overcrossing bridge is torn down			0
southbound lanes are expected to reopen by wednesday morning one worker suffered smoke inhalation after not realizing the bridge was alight ! going nowhere fast : @entity222 diverts traffic off of @entity2			1
a traffic jam up to 20 miles long was created as a result of the incident traffic jam : motorists drive along the emergency lane as traffic on @entity2 came to a stop just south the @entity232 as it burned on monday			0

@entity234 crossed @entity2 15 - the main road running from @entity3 to @entity4
