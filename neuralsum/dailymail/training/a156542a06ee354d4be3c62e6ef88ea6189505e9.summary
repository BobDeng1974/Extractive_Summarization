the vessel that now holds the title of the world ’s biggest ship has taken to the seas for the first time			2
called @entity6 , the behemoth can lift oil rigs right out of the water and move them to new destinations			2
it measures a staggering 1,253ft ( 382 metres ) long and 407ft ( 124 metres ) wide , making it almost as long as the @entity12 is tall and wider than the height of @entity14			0
@entity21 company @entity20 commissioned the building of the huge $ 1.7bn ship			1
both the legs and main structure of a rig can be moved simultaneously ( shown in illustration ) the giant catamaran - shaped ship was built by @entity31 shipyard in @entity19			1
last week the world 's largest cruise ship ( above ) arrived in the @entity34 for the first time			0
the £ 800m ( $ 1.3bn ) @entity36 sailed into @entity37 at 10am last wednesday in dense fog , welcomed by a crowd of hundreds and helicopters circling overhead			0
weighing 225,282 tonnes , the 1,187ft ( 359 metres ) ship is longer than @entity44 's @entity43 is tall , and at 208ft ( 64 metres ) wide , larger than the wingspan of a @entity46			0
it cost £ 1.9 billion ( $ 3.1 billion ) to build and is powered by 11.2 megawatt engines connected to 13 @entity50 5.5 megawatt thrusters , reports @entity51			1
topsides - the upper section of oil rigs - weighing up to 48,000 tons can be lifted by the behemoth , while it will also be able to lift jackets - the legs - of rigs weighing up to 25,000 tonnes			0
the ship can then transport both the top and bottom sections of the oil rig simultaneously and take it back to port			0
it can even raise and lower itself in the water by 82ft ( 25 metres ) in order to cope with the huge weight demands of moving an oil rig			0
@entity71 , which will be operated by @entity21 company @entity20 , is expected to begin offshore operations next year			1
it can reach speeds of 14 knots ( 16.1 mph or 25.9 km / h ) and has space for a crew of 571 people			1
called @entity6 ( shown ) it is almost as big as the @entity12			2
it will be used to pick up and move oil rigs from one place to another			2
it can reach speeds of 14 knots and hold a crew of 571 people			1
@entity20 says it will enter offshore operations next year when it enters operation it will also be the world 's largest pipelaying ship and will be used to construct infrastructure under the sea			1
its pipelay capacity of 2,000 tonnes is double that of the previous record holder , another @entity20 ship called @entity96			0
@entity71 will only hold the title of the world ’s biggest ship for six years , though ; by 2020 @entity20 expects to have an even larger vessel in operation to install and move bigger oil rigs			1
the @entity103 also built by @entity31 still holds the record for the longest ship , though , at 1,312 feet ( 400 metres )			0
how it measures up : while @entity6 will be the largest ship in the world , it will not quite be as long as some other vessels it measures a staggering 1,253 feet ( 382 metres ) long and 407ft ( 124 metres ) wide , making it almost as long as the @entity12 ( right ) is tall and wider than the height of @entity14 ( left )			2

the biggest vessel in the world has been built by @entity31 in @entity19
@entity21 company @entity20 commissioned the building of the huge £ 1.9 billion ( $ 3.1 billion ) ship
called @entity6 , the vessel is almost as long as the @entity12 and wide as @entity14 's @entity14
the *vehicle* will be used to pick up and move oil rigs from one place to another , such as to and from port
both the legs and main structure of a rig can be carried on the ship and moved simultaneously
it can reach speeds of 14 knots ( 16.1 mph or 25.9 km / h ) and hold a crew of 571 people
