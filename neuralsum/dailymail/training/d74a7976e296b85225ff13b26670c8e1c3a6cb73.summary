' i went over to try to calm it all down and one of them spat in my face			2
i was then punched by another and a scuffle broke out			1
' i slipped over and on the ground one of them kicked me in the head twice and knocked me out			0

' we can confirm that a 39 - year - old man from the @entity106 area who is involved with the hunt was assaulted and needed treatment at @entity74			2

' the number of people involved in saboteur activities is far fewer than in the past , however we are concerned that the extremists who remain are increasingly resorting to violence			0
' there have been a number of incidents over the past few years involving assaults on hunt staff and supporters by people who have masked their identities			0
' we are particularly worried about the increasing tendency to violence by those wearing balaclavas and face coverings in a bid to escape the law			0
' we call upon the police to use their powers , wherever possible , to unmask people who wear face coverings to hunt meets before there is violence			0
' mr @entity6 has been advised to rest for at least a week following the attack			1
