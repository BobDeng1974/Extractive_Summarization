first they were accused of trying to cash in on the royal wedding , then they breached strict advertising laws surrounding the @entity4			1
but this time , the @entity5 seem to have offended an even more formidable foe : @entity7			0
just days before the new @entity7 film , @entity11 , was released , their party company was advertising apparently unlicensed 007 merchandise , urging online shoppers to throw their own ‘ secret agent ’ event			1
the @entity17 website featured an advert dedicated to the movie , complete with the @entity11 logo , its release date and an iconic black and white picture of the film ’s star , @entity23 , seen through the barrel of a gun			1
in hot water : @entity29 , right , with children @entity30 and @entity7 , and husband @entity28 but the @entity5 ’ keenness to make money out of the phenomenon appears to have raised eyebrows among the legendary @entity37 family , who not only produce the @entity7 films but own – and jealously guard – all product , image and merchandising rights			0
a spokesman for their @entity44 - based firm , @entity43 , told the @entity46 they were aware who owned @entity17 , set up in 1987 by the @entity49 ’s mother , @entity29			1
they said the issue had been passed on to the marketing and legal department – meaning that @entity17 is very likely to be unlicensed to thrill			0
@entity43 was founded by @entity37 , who died in 1996			0
it is now owned by his daughter , @entity56 , and stepson , @entity58 , who also produce the @entity7 films			0
the spokesman added : ‘ it is not something we comment on but the film makers are very protective of everything they have built up			0
' it is something we take very seriously			0
’ the offending advert : it has now been removed from the website the situation is particularly awkward as the @entity49 ’s father - in - law , the @entity72 , and his wife , the @entity73 , were guests of honour at the royal world premiere of @entity11 last week , where they met @entity23 and the @entity7 cast as well as miss @entity56			1
hours after the @entity46 contacted @entity17 and @entity43 on friday , the offending banner disappeared from the company ’s website			1
but it is not clear whether the removal of the advert was the result of any threatened legal action from the @entity7 producers , as @entity17 did not respond to a request for comment			2
the goods , which are still available , are listed under the heading ‘ @entity7 @entity90 ’			2
they include a £ 3.99 table centrepiece made up of two paper martini glasses and a stiletto shoe , and tuxedo - shaped gift boxes for 50p each			2
the firm also sells ‘ 0 ’ and ‘ 7 ’ silver helium balloons at £ 6.99 each , and gold plastic martini party glasses for £ 1.49 a pop. it is not the first time that the @entity73 of @entity104 ’s family has run into trouble over marketing issues			0
earlier this year they were asked to amend their website after falling foul of strict advertising laws covering the @entity4 with a range of games - themed goods			1
they were also accused by @entity44 ’s @entity115 of illegally carrying its logo on their website and criticised for cashing in on the royal wedding with a range of themed items including corgi cake toppers and @entity44 trivia scratch cards			1
although the business ’s accounts are not publicly available , the firm is clearly a money - spinner for the @entity5 , who recently bought a £ 4.7million country home and have put their three children through private school			2
it is a remarkable achievement for mrs @entity29 , who started the business from scratch by making party bags around her kitchen table .			0
