all day long by @entity1 famously and memorably , the poet @entity3 asked : ' why should i let the toad work / @entity5 on my life ? ' he longed to be ' ... courageous enough / to shout stuff your pension ! - but knew he never would			1
coffee morning : @entity12 at work the tyranny of the nine - to - five is about money ( of course ) , but also about moral worth : we work because we know we should ' pull our weight ' in society 's tug - of - war			1
on any morning , in any town or city all over the world , people stream into their places of work , some driven by a sense of vocation , some by resigned boredom , some by greed , some by need			1
surely it is work , not love , which makes the world go round ? @entity1 offers an excellent contribution to our knowledge of the world of work in all its variety - not through tedious sociological analysis ( thank goodness ) , but through the stories of real people she has interviewed all over the country			1
reading this book reminds me how times have changed dramatically since my generation left school or college in the @entity55 with no worries about finding a job			0
@entity1 makes it bleakly clear that for many people today , ' the idea that good work brings a good life no longer holds '			1
@entity62 divides her workers in interesting categories , yoking disparate occupations in terms of their overall function			0
so the ' making ' chapter gives us a potter , a shoemaker and ( yes ) a robot , which introduces us to its maintenance engineers			0
' serving ' includes a sex worker , two baristas , a call centre adviser and a political special adviser			0
those ' repairing ' are a rabbi , an @entity79 major and a nurse , while those ' leading ' are a company director , a stay - at - home mum ( inspired , that one ) and a hereditary lord			0
@entity62 writes : ' i continuously heard that people loved their jobs , and sometimes this worried me ' the scope of the book is broad			2
we meet those who are selling , entertaining , thinking , caring - as well as a curious clutch of people @entity62 lumps together under ' starting ' : a goldsmith 's apprentice ( one of my favourites ) , a rebellious intern , an entrepreneur specialising in ' start - up ' technologies , an unemployed graduate			2
there 's also a 56 - year - old man on @entity105 , usually known as ' workfare ' - the @entity108 initiative designed for those on @entity110 , to help them ' gain a better understanding of the discipline and focus required for work ... while at the same time making a contribution to the community '			1
@entity1 clearly does not think very much of ' workfare ' : in fact , it 's clear she despises the scheme			2
here , although of course anyone can see that the system is not perfect , i wish she had n't editorialised so overtly			0
i really wanted to hear more about what @entity123 thought of his life			0
a book which aims to give the reader much - needed insight into other people 's lives ( and it certainly does that ) seems to me to be spoilt by degenerating into a student newspaper leader : ' a citizen 's income set at the right level - £ 320 a week is the current estimate - would kill off the sort of unproductive and low - paid jobs that have proliferated since 2008 in the @entity12			1
' at that point the author does not speculate what disastrous effects such indiscriminate largesse could have on the economy , with inevitable repercussions for the very men and women she has met			0
all day long by @entity1 in the @entity147 i was a huge admirer of the work of @entity150 's @entity149 and @entity152 's @entity151 , both oral historians who aimed to give insight into the lives of those with no voice , by using recorded interviews , carefully transcribed , with no questions included and no comment or judgment			1
it was a magnificent technique which catapulted the reader movingly ( and sometimes shockingly ) into the hearts and minds of prisoners , drifters , miners , people on a housing estate , and so on			2
you felt you got to know them without the author - interviewer standing in the way - although , of course , all interviews have to be edited			0
@entity1 invokes @entity149 : ' i 've often wondered what ( he ) would think of how we think about work now			1
' well , i reckon the great man would continue to record what he heard , without surprise , and without trying to fit life stories into a pre-conceived mould			2
in contrast , @entity62 writes : ' i continuously heard that people loved their jobs , and sometimes this worried me : it felt as if work was becoming more insecure on one hand , and the work ethic increasingly revered on the other			2
' at the end , she lays her cards on the table , confessing that as she listened to people 's stories , ' i most often wished for the way we work as a society to be organised more fairly and hoped for more resistance to the way it 's organised now			1
' that 's the trouble with the workers , you see			0
they 've always been unpredictable individuals who may like or dislike their jobs but just get on with life , turning their backs on revolution .			0

@entity1 tells the stories of real people she has interviewedin the @entity12
she offers an excellent contribution to our knowledge of the world of work
confesses she hoped for more resistance to the way society is organised
