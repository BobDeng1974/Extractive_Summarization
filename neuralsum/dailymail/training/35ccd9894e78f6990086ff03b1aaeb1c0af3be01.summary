by @entity0 published : 03:49 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 07:13 est , 6 february 2013 having solved one of the greatest mysteries of @entity9 history , scientists desperate to unearth the next one and confirm if @entity3 did murder the princes in the tower have been left disappointed			1
previously secret documents show that the @entity11 , backed by the @entity12 , has for 20 years refused repeated requests by experts to test skeletons believed to be the @entity17 successors buried in @entity18			1
and it appears they will not be changing their minds after the @entity22 announced to the world this week that the skeleton found under a council car park in @entity26 is that of @entity3 the hunchback king : the skeleton unearthed in a @entity26 dig last september was confirmed this week as @entity3 but the mystery of the two princes will not be solved this way crime : the princes @entity34 and @entity35 in a 1878 painting ( left ) but clerics will not allow their remains held in an urn to be probed by the same scientists who found the treacherous king @entity3 ( right ) @entity42 : on the seizure of the throne by their uncle @entity3 , the young @entity47 along with his brother the @entity49 were supposedly smothered in their sleep on the new king 's orders those in charge of @entity56 will not allow the same forensic tests used to identify the former king to be tried on remains there			1
their argument is that it could set a precedent for testing any number of historical theories linked to the many famous people buried at the church			0
clerics are also concerned what they will do with the bones if they are found not to belong to who they thought they did			2
blocked : the bosses of @entity18 will not let scientists in and have had the backing of the @entity12 and the government to do so @entity3 , depicted by @entity78 as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the @entity81 , died at the @entity82 , defeated by an army led by @entity84			1
the king 's nephews @entity34 and @entity3 were kept in the @entity81 , according to history recorded at the time , and ' stifled with pillows by the order of their perfidious uncle @entity91 ' , according to the inscription on the urn their remains are kept in			1
@entity22 's @entity97 said this week they could take dna from the princes and match it with @entity3 to find if they were related			1
but a @entity18 spokeswoman told the @entity101 : ' the recent discovery of @entity3 does not change the abbey 's position , which is that the mortal remains of two young children , widely believed since the 17th century to be the princes in tower , should not be disturbed			1
' the @entity109 , who were behind this week 's confirmation of the monarch 's identity , tried twice to get the urn opened in 1993 with the @entity115 and in 1995 with @entity116			2
but the @entity118 the very rev @entity117 refused to allow carbon dating and dna testing to get to the bottom of the mystery			0
in 1993 he took advice from academics and experts who said the techniques would only age the bones to within 50 years , and as @entity3 only reigned from 1483 to 1485 it would not be accurate enough			1
' it could not therefore differentiate between @entity3 or @entity84 – or another – being the guilty party			2
nor would the c / 14 technique give any clue as to the age at death of the children , ' the @entity131 said			0
the @entity138 and home secretary at the time , @entity140 , were all consulted and were in ' full agreement '			0
the face of a king : there were cheers from media who had gathered from around the world as the announcement was made at the @entity22 this week the fatal blows ? this image of the skull shows where @entity3 was injured theory : dr @entity97 discusses the dna evidence and is the first to confirm the remains are those of @entity3 and says this information will confirm if the bones in the @entity18 are linked to him by blood in 1995 , dealing with the @entity116 request , the @entity131 then admitted science had moved along further but could cause even more problems if he agreed to testing			1
' a sample of bone ( skin / hair / tissue ) from a known individual related to the princes would be required , and that almost certainly means opening a second tomb in the @entity18 or elsewhere			2
if the result is positive , the remains of the two princes are placed back in sir @entity175 's urn			0
but what if they are negative : what do we do with the remains ? ' he said			0
' keep them in the urn in the royal chapels , knowing they are bogus , or re-bury them elsewhere ? and what would we have gained , other than to satisfy our curiosity in one area			0
it would not bring us any nearer the truth of the affair			0
' there are others buried in the abbey whose identity is somewhat uncertain , including @entity196 , and allowing these bones to be examined could well set a precedent for other requests			0
i do not believe we are in the business of satisfying curiosity , or of certifying that remains in the abbey tombs are what they are said to be			0

@entity34 and @entity3 were killed by the king 's men in 1483
their bones are kept in @entity18 , who wo *n't* let them be tested
academics say discovery of @entity3 will allow them to solve the mystery
