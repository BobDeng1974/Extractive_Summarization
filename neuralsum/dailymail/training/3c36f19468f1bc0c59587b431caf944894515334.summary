by @entity1 reporter published : 07:55 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 08:27 est , 7 march 2013 @entity2 is set to have @entity4 's most restrictive abortion law - a near - ban on the procedure from the 12th week of pregnancy - unless a lawsuit or court action intervenes			1
lawmakers in the @entity11 - dominated @entity10 defied governor @entity12 , overriding the @entity14 's veto as the @entity15 voted 56 - 33 on wednesday , a day after the @entity16 voted to do the same			1
the votes come less than a week after the @entity10 overrode a veto of a separate bill banning most abortions starting in the 20th week of pregnancy			0
that bill took effect immediately after the final override vote , whereas the 12 - week ban wo n't take effect until this summer			2
controversial : senator @entity27 , pictured at the @entity28 in @entity29 on tuesday , was the @entity31 sponsor abortion rights proponents have said they 'll sue to block the 12 - week ban from taking effect			1
@entity12 warned lawmakers that both measures would end up wasting taxpayers ' money with the state defending them in court , where , he said , they are likely to fail			2
the measures ' supporters , who expected court challenges , were undaunted			2
' not the governor , nor anyone else other than the courts , can determine if something is constitutional or unconstitutional , ' rep. @entity44 , a @entity11 from @entity45 , said in urging his colleagues to override @entity12			0
@entity51 sponsor senator @entity27 , a @entity11 from @entity52 , watched the vote from the @entity15 gallery and said a number of law firms have offered to help the state defend the laws in court , if it comes to that			1
' the @entity10 has once again disregarded women 's health care and passed the most extreme anti-women 's health bill in the country			1
' with this bill , the @entity10 will force many women to seek unsafe care			1
' - @entity68 , @entity69 of the @entity70 ' i 'm just grateful that this body has continued to stand up for the bills that have passed			2
the eyes of the entire nation were on the @entity15 today , ' he said			0
@entity12 rejected both measures for the same reasons , saying they are unconstitutional and that they contradict the 1973 @entity82 ruling that legalized abortion until a fetus could viably survive outside the womb			2
a fetus is generally considered viable at 22 to 24 weeks			0
' the @entity10 has once again disregarded women 's health care and passed the most extreme anti-women 's health bill in the country , ' said @entity68 , the ceo of @entity69 of the @entity70			1
' with this bill , the @entity10 will force many women to seek unsafe care			1
' sen. @entity94 , center , offers an amendment to an abortion bill during a meeting of the @entity99 at the @entity100 in @entity101 , yesterday the 12 - week ban would prohibit abortions from the point when a fetus ' heartbeat can typically be detected using an abdominal ultrasound			1
it includes exemptions for rape , incest , the life of the mother and highly lethal fetal disorders			0
the 20 - week prohibition , which is based on the disputed claim that a fetus can feel pain by the 20th week and therefore deserves protection from abortion , includes all of the same exemptions except for fetal disorders			1
six @entity122 joined with @entity11 in voting to override the veto of the 12 - week ban			2
last week , only two @entity122 voted to override the veto of the 20 - week ban			1
' i think a lot of people felt some pressure after the last vote , ' said @entity15 minority leader @entity129 , a @entity14 from @entity130			0
the measure is among several abortion restrictions lawmakers have backed since @entity11 won control of the @entity15 and @entity16 in the november election			2
@entity11 hold 21 of the 35 @entity16 seats , and 51 of the 100 seats in the @entity15			0
it takes a simple majority in both chambers to override			0
the @entity31 makes abortion illegal at 12 weeks - the toughest laws in the @entity4 @entity12 has signed into law one of those measures , a prohibition on most abortion coverage by insurers participating in the exchange created under the health care law			1
rep. @entity150 , a @entity11 of @entity151 serving her third term in the @entity15 , asked her colleagues to support the override attempt , saying her votes on anti-abortion bills this year were the first time she could fully express her view on the issue at the @entity28			0
when @entity122 held control , such bills never made it this far			0
' if i say that i 'm pro-life , at some point i have to do something about what i say i believe , ' said @entity150 , the bill 's sponsor in the @entity15			0
unlike the 20 - week ban , which took effect immediately , the 12 - week restriction wo n't take effect until 90 days after the @entity15 and @entity16 adjourn			2
lawmakers are n't expected to wrap up this year 's session until later this month or april			0
in vetoing both measures , @entity12 has cited the costs to the state if it has to defend either ban in court			0
the @entity180 of @entity2 has vowed to sue if the state enacts the 12 - week ban and said it is considering legal action over the 20 - week restriction as well			1
' i think today , for whatever reason , the @entity15 turned its back on the women of @entity2 and said , we do n't think you 're capable of making your own decisions , ' said @entity189 , @entity180 of @entity2 ' executive director			0
@entity189 said the group planned to file suit in federal court in the next couple weeks			0
@entity12 noted that the state paid nearly $ 148,000 to attorneys for plaintiffs who successfully challenged a 1997 late - term abortion ban			1
the original version of @entity27 's bill would have banned abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy , but he changed the measure after facing resistance from some lawmakers worried that it would require the use of a vaginal probe			0
women who have abortions would not face prosecution under @entity27 's bill , but doctors who perform abortions in violation of the 12 - week ban could have their medical licenses revoked .			1

new law , the most restrictive in the @entity4 , voted in 56 - 33
abortion rights *campaigners* have vowed to fight it in court
they say women over the limit will now seek ' unsafe care '
