one in 30 deaths in @entity2 are now from euthanasia , it has been revealed			1
it comes after the @entity2 government allowed mobile death squads to kill sick and elderly people in their own homes			1
official figures released yesterday , showed that euthanasia deaths soared by 13 per cent in 2012 compared to the previous year			1
there were 4,188 deaths by euthanasia last year – accounting for three per cent of all deaths - compared to 3,695 deaths by euthanasia in 2011			1
one way trip : euthanasia in the @entity2 is carried out by a doctor administering a strong sedative to put the patient in a coma , followed by a drug to stop breathing and cause death it marks the sixth consecutive year that deaths by euthanasia have increased in the @entity2			1
the government has said that the reasons for the increase in euthanasia deaths can not be determined with certainty			1
leading theories include a growing awareness and acceptance of the practice among both @entity2 doctors and patients			2
in march last year , however , @entity2 launched the world ’s first mobile death squads to be dispatched in cases when family doctors refused to administer lethal drugs on ‘ ethical ’ grounds			1
the six units , comprising of at least a doctors and a nurse , were expected to send the number of euthanasia cases in @entity2 rocketing , with pro-euthanasia campaigners saying they would end the lives of an additional 1,000 ‘ borderline ’ patients a year			1
anti-euthanasia activists in @entity55 said yesterday the year - on - year increases in euthanasia death proved argument that euthanasia was a ‘ slippery slope ’			2
@entity61 , the honorary secretary of @entity62 , said : ‘ it is what we expected and i do hope that people will pay more attention now to the warnings that have been made about introducing euthanasia to this country			2
‘ the @entity2 experience shows that euthanasia becomes routine , ’ she added			1
‘ it traps more and more people into thinking they ought to leave this world prematurely			0
‘ in that kind of culture euthanasia becomes expected and inevitable and everything else – such as good palliative care and a functional hospice movement – is gradually portrayed as rather selfish			0
’ @entity81 of @entity82 , a disability rights group , said : ‘ these numbers fill me with fear and horror			0
‘ we are failing to see the dangers , ’ said mrs @entity81 who has been confined to a wheelchair since an attack of @entity90 in the early 1990s			0
the @entity94 building in @entity95 near @entity96 : under @entity99 law only ' assisted suicide ' is permitted - which means that patients must take an active role in administering the drug that ends their lives ‘ anyone who believes these figures to be necessary or acceptable should look to the future and be wary of the moment when the death doctor calls at their house uninvited – when the safeguards , score - sheets and so - called sentimentality have given way to a new world where age , infirmity and “ useless ” lives are seen as unnecessary and people like me are targeted once again			0
’ @entity2 became the first country in the world since @entity123 to legalise euthanasia when in 2002 it approved doctor - administered lethal drugs for terminally ill people facing unbearable suffering			1
for several years , the reported number of cases declined , but since 2006 – when there were 1,923 deaths by euthanasia - they have risen steadily			2
most cases involve cancer patients but increasingly that have included dementia sufferers and even psychiatric patients			0
in 2005 the @entity139 protected doctors from being prosecuted for the euthanasia of infants as long as they followed approved guidelines			0
euthanasia is carried out by administering a strong sedative to put the patient in a coma , followed by a drug to stop breathing and cause death			0
the @entity2 government has insisted that ‘ the greatest care ’ is taken to offer euthanasia only to patients ‘ who are suffering unbearably with no prospect of improvement ’			1
@entity2 is following a pattern of incremental euthanasia deaths wherever the practice has been legalised			1
last year , @entity161 , where euthanasia came into force in 2003 , saw a 25 per cent increase in the number of euthanasia deaths , leaping from 1,133 in 2011 to 1,432 , a figure representing about two per cent of all deaths in the country			1
a similar pattern is emerging in those countries where physician - assisted suicide has been legalised.in @entity172 in the @entity173 , physician - assisted suicide deaths increased by 17 per cent in 2012 to 83 cases , up from 70 in 2011			2
again there were incremental rises of 51 in 2010 and 36 in 2009 , when the state ’ s @entity178 took effect			0
in the neighbouring state of @entity185 , the first @entity173 - state to legalise assisted suicide , deaths at the hands of doctors are also at an all - time high			2
there were 59 assisted suicide deaths in @entity185 in 2009 , 65 in 2010 , 71 in 2011 and 77 in 2012 - a 30 per cent increase overall in just four years			0
overall , assisted suicides have shot up by 381 per cent from 16 in 1998 , when the practice was legalised			0
@entity99 , which first relaxed prohibitions on assisted suicide in 1942 , has seen a 700 per cent increase deaths in the same period			0
authorities recorded a steady rise of assisted suicides of @entity99 nationals from 43 in 1998 to 297 in 2009			0
the figures do not include people from abroad who travel to @entity94 to commit suicide there .			0

around 3 per cent of all deaths in the @entity2 are now by euthanasia
the country last year introduced mobile euthanasia units
in 2002 it became the first country since @entity123 to legalise it
