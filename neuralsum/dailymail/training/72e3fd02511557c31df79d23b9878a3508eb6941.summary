touring the @entity0 in winter in a motorhome might not have the same cachet as a swanky @entity4 holiday , but we had an absolute blast			1
yes , i hit my head on the low - set cupboards at least three times a day , and yes , it was all rather hugger - mugger for a family of four			2
but in the evening , with the gas fire on , and the rain thrumming on the roof , and my sons @entity17 and @entity18 snuffling in their den above the driver 's seat , our cosy motorhome had a rare charm			2
there 's just about this much room to move : @entity25 with son @entity17 en route to the ski resorts of @entity28 even if it was tricky to drive - at nearly 23ft , you really do need the rear - view camera and somebody on pointing duty while you reverse			1
there was no room for suitcases , so we decanted all our clobber into cupboards			2
though the @entity41 696 technically sleeps six , it 's a tight fit - particularly when you 're lugging ski gear			1
we were hitting the slopes of @entity28 and staying at @entity44 , one of the resort 's many campsites			1
hiring skis was the usual caper and pricey — starting at around £ 80 for a day 's ski - hire , plus £ 90 for ski - passes for a family of four			1
the slopes were like @entity54 on snow			1
forty - five minutes to get up to the top car - park ; hour - long queues for the funicular railway to the top of the mountain , and queue after dispiriting queue for the button - lifts and t - bars			2
close - to - home snow : the ski resorts of the @entity68 offer a less expensive alternative to the high @entity4 the skiing was good but limited - two days was more than enough			1
but when the sun came out , the @entity68 were every bit as breathtaking as the @entity4			1
and on the second day , our motorhome came into its own			0
as my family snoozed , i drove us to the top car - park by 8.30am			0
we now had a decent base for lunch , cooked in our little oven and washed down with a glass of chilled @entity82 from the fridge , plus time for a nap afterwards			0
an upside - down sort of situation : @entity17 and @entity18 manage to fit themselves into the motorhome the sight of me climbing into my tight top bunk was - apparently - the funniest thing of the holiday			0
life in a motorhome is like being on a tight - knit submarine			0
but it also engenders a wonderful camaraderie as well as a lot of laughs — and that , really , is what family holidays are all about			0
