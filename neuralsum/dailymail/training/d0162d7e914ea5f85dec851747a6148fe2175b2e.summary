' you know , i did n’t have to worry about the judgment of my family , i did n’t have to worry about breaking his heart , all that stuff like this			0
it ’s , like , how i got a clean getaway			0

at one point , she could be seen checking the calendar on her smartphone covered with a @entity112 sticker for the optimal date for the assassination			0
getting down to details , @entity3 explains that she is reluctant to stage the murder as a burglary gone awry because she is worried that it would scare off her friend , whom she wanted to move in with her after her husband 's death			1
during the second meeting on april 10 , @entity50 , sporting a @entity112 sweatshirt and a pair of pink sweatpants , stresses several times that she does not want her spouse to suffer , and that she wants him to die as painlessly as possible			0

’ ‘ the more shocked i am when it happens , the better , ’ she tells the hit man			2
‘ i just want to make it as non-suspicious as possible			0
’ in their first conversation , the young mother tells the hit man that she would prefer the deed to be done outside their @entity174 home , explaining with a laugh that a shooting indoors ' would be messy in the house			1
' when @entity3 meets up with the detective the following day , carrying a floor plan of their home and directions to the house drawn on lined notebooks sheets , as well as her husband ’s ' photo , the two decide that the best option is to have mr @entity189 killed inside the apartment while she is at work			2

merfled then asks the bogus killer , ' what happens if you get caught ? ' in response , the man reassures her that he will ' take the hit ' and keep her name out of the investigation so long as she pays him or his associates ‘ on the outside ’ the agreed upon sum of $ 50,000			1
