critics on both sides of the @entity2 have been getting their hand - wrapping in a twist over @entity5 , at the grand old age of 49 , fighting one of boxing ’s hardest and most devastating punchers			1
@entity10 is too much of a health risk for the most venerable gentleman of the ring , they cry			2
they protested just the same only four months ago , before @entity5 defeated @entity15 to unify the @entity18 and @entity19 world light - heavyweight titles			1
champion : @entity5 ' diet , work - out regime and @entity24 lifestyle have helped him carry on boxing for so long support : @entity5 celebrates victory over @entity15 following their @entity19 & @entity28 light - heavyweight title fight again , @entity5 replies : ‘ age is but a number			1
’ so it is and that number keeps rising in all sports as medical science , high - tech training methods and social sacrifices enable more and more athletes to prolong their careers			0
in the case of @entity5 , his dedication to diet , his work - out regime and a @entity24 lifestyle are of a devout religious order			2
never mind the birth certificate , examine the physical specimen			0
@entity5 has changed his nickname from @entity5 to @entity48 and really is an out - of - this - world phenomenon			1
by appearance , certainly in the physique , @entity5 looks about the same age as @entity53 , who is super-fit at 37 and as such the best pound - for - pound fighter on this planet			2
the best : @entity5 looks about the same age as @entity53 , left , despite being 12 years older youthful smile : @entity53 is arguably the best pound - for - pound boxer in the world @entity5 is a profoundly intelligent boxer and a highly articulate advocate for his sport			1
there are no signs of wear and tear from his 65 fights spanning 28 years , the majority of them against other world - class operators in middleweight and light - heavy title fights			1
yet again , he has no hesitation in agreeing to take on the most dangerous of opponents			0
negotiations to face @entity75 began last thursday and were finalised on friday , 24 hours before the @entity73 sealed his end of the deal by defending his @entity79 title with a three knock - down , second round flattening of previously undefeated challenger @entity82			1
@entity5 and @entity10 will come to blows this november , either in @entity84 or at the state - of - the - art @entity85 in @entity87			1
and while the commentators are voicing fears for the well - being of @entity5 , many good judges in the boxing fraternity are declining to write him off			2
@entity93 , promoter of @entity82 , observed after watching his man crushed : ‘ @entity10 has dynamite in his fists but @entity5 is such a clever and cagey boxer that he definitely has a chance			2
’ intimidating : critics fear that @entity10 , left , will destroy @entity5 in a similar manner to his win over @entity101 , right nor has he ever been knocked out , although @entity10 ’s own promoter , @entity102 , says : ‘ we expect @entity75 to be the first to do that			1
’ @entity5 reassures those worried for him by saying : ‘ i have every intention of becoming the undisputed world light - heavyweight champion			1
’ in that pursuit he has turned to @entity10 after perceiving what he believes to be the reluctance of another big - hitting champion , @entity114 ’s @entity113 belt - holder @entity115 , to go through with their pre-contracted clash ,			2
defeated : the @entity73 was unstoppable during his win over @entity120 in august of last year specimen : @entity10 celebrates after comfortably beating @entity101 in @entity121 in august 2013 already the oldest boxer to win and successfully defend a world title , he is determined to become the first 50 - year - old ever to reign as world champion			1
if he beats @entity75 he will secure that remarkable place in history , since he would not be expected to fight again before his birthday on january 15			1
@entity10 , who despatched our own @entity101 into oblivion and almost into early retirement , predicts : ‘ i will send @entity48 to @entity132			1
’ @entity5 , however , is one of the most difficult boxers on whom to land a concussive blow , as well as the shrewdest accumulator of points			2
one is 18 years older than the other but there is no certainty as to which of them will end up seeing stars on the night of november 8 on @entity144 or the @entity145			1
the rash of dodgy decisions lately seems to be provoking more and more losers - amateur as well as professional – to cry foul by the judges			0
close though it was on the official score - cards there was no doubt in my mind that @entity157 rightly made another slice of history in @entity160			0
the sunny lass from @entity162 , who became in @entity164 the first female boxer to win an @entity166 , repeated that feat at the @entity168 on saturday			0
just winner : @entity157 holds up her medal after winning @entity168 gold in @entity160 not happy : @entity172 , left , was not happy after judges ruled @entity174 to be the winner on saturday it was well - deserved but @entity177 ’s young @entity172 cried ‘ robbery , ’ apparently believing she had been the victim of @entity174 ’ reputation and status			0
@entity174 is well into her 30s now and the proper time and place for the promising @entity172 to make her point will be at the @entity185 two years from now			0
@entity186 : @entity172 claimed she had been ' robbed ' and that she was a victim of @entity174 ' reputation and status the night before in @entity190 , @entity189 also went close but not close enough to taking the @entity192 welterweight title from @entity193			0
@entity189 , despite being down and almost out in mid-fight , also blamed the judges not only that but he claimed @entity193 told him he had really won			0
if so , the champion was being kind to ease @entity189 ’s disappointment			0
for the first time in nine years it was no funtime for @entity199 but to his credit he apologised later for complaining			0
@entity189 remembered the importance of dignity in defeat			0
good for him and he will come again			0
for @entity205 , that is a lesson she has still to learn .			0

@entity5 has agreed to fight @entity75 on november 8
the 49 - year - old is 18 years older than his @entity73 opponent
critics are *concerned* for his health as he prepares for the @entity144 bout
but @entity5 has proved his fitness despite his age , most recently when he beat @entity15 four months ago
his body shows no signs of wear and tear from 65 fights across 28 years
@entity10 , who beat @entity101 comfortably in august 2013 , has promised to ' send the alien to @entity132 '
@entity5 determined to be world champion for his 50th birthday in january
