' @entity209 1 : eating carbs at night will make you fat fact : ' eating carbs at night wo n't make you fat , nor will it stop you losing fat			2
it all comes down to what you eat and how much you eat each day			0
' @entity209 2 : @entity220 , slow cardio sessions are the best for burning fat fact : ' weights and high intensity training for a shorter period of time is definitely the most effective way to burn fat			0
you 'll burn fat for up to 24 hours after you finish training compared to only around an hour or two after slow cardio			0
' @entity209 3 : if you want to lose fat â€“ then eat less fact : ' when it comes to getting your fat percentage down , you do n't necessarily need to eat less			0
sometimes you may even need to eat more ! ' @entity4 says what you eat is so much more important than how much you eat			1
giving your body a good balance of nutrients is far more important than the size of your meals			0

good fats give you energy , help rebuild cells and helps to produce hormones			0

' also avoid low fat foods as they are usually choc - full of sugar and chemicals			0
' @entity209 5 : women bulk up if they lift weights fact : weights shape and sculpt your body , whilst also burning fat and unless you 're taking some serious supplements , they will never make you look masculine or bulky			0
according to @entity4 , it takes a lot of deliberate effort with your training and diet to get even close to bulking up , so unless you 're trying to get bulky , you simply wo n't be able to			1
@entity209 6 : you need to crunch your way to @entity268 fact : ' you can do all the abdominal work you like but if you do n't eat clean and do full body exercises to remove the layer of fat that covers your abs , then you 'll never achieve the desired definition			2
' @entity209 7 : strength training is dangerous fact : whether you 're strength training or doing cardio , all exercises are dangerous if they 're not done correctly			0
as long as you learn proper technique strength training , it is completely safe and a really important part of any fitness plan			2
@entity209 8 : the scales tell all fact : the scales only tell you how much your total weight is , not how lean you are			0
so the best way to track progress is by how you look , how your clothes fit and by taking a measure of your total body fat			0
@entity209 9 : the @entity294 , the better you 'll get fact : ' overtraining can actually cause your body stress and it can even go into fight or flight mode which can cause it to store fat			0
focusing on efficient workouts , good nutrition , adequate sleep and rest will give you the best shot at getting the best results			0
' @entity209 10 : you burn more fat on an empty stomach fact : this is really a personal preference			2
a lot of people do n't tend to train as vigorously when they have an empty stomach and tend to binge after training			0
