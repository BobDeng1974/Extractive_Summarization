a new report from @entity1 shows that @entity2 without medical insurance now make up 15.6 per cent of the population , the lowest level since 2008			1
but the organization hedged its bets when @entity8 asked how @entity10 enrollments might taint its conclusions			1
@entity12 , a @entity1 methodologist , wrote monday that the number , down from a recent high of 18 per cent at the beginning of the six - month @entity17 open enrollment period , is ' a sign that the @entity17 ... appears to be accomplishing its goal of increasing the percentage of @entity2 with health insurance coverage			1
' most of the swing toward the insurance rolls , however , has been among populations that have subscribed in large numbers to @entity10 , a low - income benefit program whose costs are borne entirely by taxpayers			2
@entity1 editor - in - chief @entity31 backed away from the suggestion that the numbers indicated success for president @entity35 , telling @entity8 on monday that @entity37 merely ' thought that was a reasonable assumption			1
' ' really , all we 're saying , ' he insisted , ' is that the uninsured level has declined			0
... we do n't know how many people have paid the premiums , we do n't know how many are on @entity10			2
' ' that 's why we used the word " appears "			0
' @entity1 found that the percentage of @entity2 residents without medical insurance has dipped to its lowest level since before @entity35 took office , but hidden in the graph is a surge in @entity10 enrollments whose costs are 100 per cent bore by taxpayers ' uninsured ' statistics dipped among black @entity2 faster than in any other ethnic group , tracking with african - americans ' pace of @entity10 participation that far outstrips their population numbers ; these women waited in @entity63 last week to sign up for @entity17 @entity1 's data show that 18.0 per cent of @entity2 residents lacked medical insurance at the end of the third quarter of 2013 , when @entity17 's open enrollment began			1
that number dropped to 15.6 per cent at the end of march			0
but the trend - within - a - trend may be that the @entity75 's push to move @entity2 into the ranks of the insured has mainly served to beef up a wealth transfer scheme			2
a reduction from 18.0 to 15.6 per cent represents about 7 million @entity2 whom @entity1 says became insured in the last six months			0
@entity8 presented @entity79 with a scenario in which 1.5 million were previously uninsured private insurance customers with paid policies , and the rest were medicaid enrollees			1
' sure , absolutely , ' he said , responding to a question about whether that would cause @entity1 to change its mind about @entity17 's success level			1
there is no deadline for joining @entity10 , which stays open for new enrollments year - round			0
a @entity8 analysis showed last week that the number of paid private insurance enrollments from @entity2 who were previously uninsured – in contrast with those who lost their insurance after @entity17 became law and replaced it since october – may be as low as 858,000			1
among those genuine new enrollees , government subsidies will pay for much of the cost			0
@entity8 based its calculations on a forthcoming @entity104 study that only the @entity105 has seen in its entirety			1
the @entity105 , however , published a few startling details			0
just 23 per cent of new @entity17 enrollees had no insurance before signing up , @entity104 found			2
and of those newly insured @entity2 , just 53 per cent have paid their first month 's premiums			0
the rest , we are left to assume , are on @entity10			0
' we all knew this would be a giant @entity10 boom , ' a @entity114 official told mailonline monday on condition of anonymity , because he was not authorized to speak publicly			1
' it 's pretty clear that the president wanted an even bigger one			0
' ' whether @entity1 spins this as a net gain on insured - versus - uninsured numbers is up to them , ' the official continued , ' but they 're really comparing apples to oranges unless they separate insurance buyers from people who have it handed to them ' [ through @entity10 ]			1
gloating for now : president @entity35 boasted about signing up 7.1 million @entity135 insurance coverage , but he did n't say how many had paid their premiums or how many already were insured before his signature law took effect -- and he glossed ove3r the @entity10 enrollment figures the @entity1 report , published online monday morning , acknowledged that ' [ t ] he uninsured rate for lower - income @entity2 dropped 3.2 points to 27.5 % – the largest decline within any key subgroup – while the uninsured rate for blacks fell 3.3 points to 17.6 %			1
' low - income @entity2 residents are by definition the core constituency of @entity10			2
padding the numbers : under @entity17 , @entity2 earning up to 138 per cent of the federal government 's poverty - line income can choose free @entity10 coverage and the @entity158 has reported that through the year 2012 , blacks comprised 20 per cent of @entity10 benefit recipients			1
the @entity161 found that just 12.6 per cent of the @entity2 population is @entity163			0
@entity1 mentioned @entity10 only in the final paragraph of its report – hundreds of words after declaring that the @entity17 system ' appears ' to be succeeding			2
' @entity10 has likely added millions to its enrollment due to its expansion , ' @entity1 says , ' although – as with the exchanges themselves – it remains unclear how many were previously insured and moved to @entity10 as a less expensive option			0
' ' regardless , the decline in the percentage of uninsured over the course of the first quarter almost certainly includes the effects of expanded @entity10 eligibility policies			0
' @entity1 also notes that it is ' likely ... that not all new enrollees will ultimately pay their insurance premiums , which would result in a subsequent change in status from insured to uninsured at some point later in 2014			1
' @entity31 told @entity8 that @entity1 will convene a group of journalists on april 16 to ' look at some internal data that we 'll be able to analyze by that point			0
' those data , he said , may be able to suggest a story behind the sudden drop in the number of uninsured @entity2			2
' at the moment , this is what we have , ' he said , pointing to monday morning 's report			0
' if new data come along that suggest something more , then we 'll report it			0
' the @entity114 did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether ' uninsured ' percentages will rebound upward as some enrollees fail to pay , and others replace paid insurance with @entity10 after receiving cancellation notices .			1

a @entity1 writer had *claimed* that *shrinking* numbers of ' uninsured ' @entity2 was proof @entity17 is ' accomplishing its goal '
but the organization 's top editor backed off that claim , agreeing that the number could *rocket* back up as people fail to pay premiums , and signups for taxpayer - *funded* @entity10 ' insurance ' are *factored* in
an @entity114 official *confided* that @entity1 is comparing apples and oranges unless it separates @entity10 *consumers* from @entity2 with private insurance
@entity1 's *eidtor* - in - chief *conceded* that his organization 's conclusions would have to change , if few paying @entity17 subscribers materialize who were uninsured before the law took effect
a @entity8 analysis based on forthcoming @entity104 numbers showed last week that as few as 858,000 people could fit that *description*
