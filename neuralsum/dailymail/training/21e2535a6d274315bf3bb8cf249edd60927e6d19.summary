@entity0 is the @entity1 ' snobbiest city , reveals a new study , beating @entity3 into second place			1
the @entity5 was found to be the one place where people hold their head ( and noses ) up that little bit higher according to result of a questionnaire about @entity1 's @entity13			1
but is it snobbery , or pride ? and could ' confidence ' somehow be misconstrued as snobbery ? @entity0 topped the pile for snobbery ; other categories included wine bars , museums , and cleanliness , in which voters evaluated 38 major metropolitan areas			2
@entity0 , with its luxurious feel , was top of the list of the @entity1 's snobbiest cities showbiz capital @entity30 is an unsurprising third on the list , but @entity33 lands fourth place not just due to its thousands of high - powered political types but its trendy art scene			1
one @entity0 photographer believes the home of the @entity39 should have toppled his home town			2
@entity42 told @entity43 said : ' in @entity33 , it ’s all about what you do			1
you can be among @entity0 's elite if you 're an artist , but in @entity33 , that might get you , at best , a look of ‘ bless your little heart			1
' here we take a look at the top 10 snobbiest cities , and explore some of the attractions that might make residents feel that little bit better about themselves			1
1 @entity0 the art scene , shopping and luxury are all too evident in @entity0			1
and many residents are certainly ' at the top of their game '			2
but the question is , why not show it ? the bright lights of @entity0 ; there are more billionaires here than any other city in the world it ranks as the least affordable city in the @entity1 , so this could also point towards why people ranked it as the country 's snobbiest city			1
interestingly , @entity0 is the number one city in the world when it comes to billionaire residents			2
2 @entity3 the well - sought after winner of @entity1 's ' @entity83 ' category , it 's little wonder these @entity85 are confident with themselves			1
the cocktail bars in and around @entity87 are where you will find residents keeping well within their style , and @entity93 's @entity92 is listed by the magazine as highly respected			0
the @entity95 , an art gallery , offers live music , mojitos , and cigars for a memorable experience			1
@entity3 was named as the city with the best looking people and the second most snobby @entity30 , with its red carpet and all can either make you , or break you 3 @entity30 it 's perhaps surprising that @entity30 was only in third spot in the snobby table , with its @entity109 red carpet set and all			1
upscale department stores of @entity109 's @entity112 can either make you feel a million dollars , or like a pathetic pauper who wished you had a million dollars			1
the @entity116 restaurant is the place to visit if you feel you fit in more with celebrities			0
but the city did rank in the top 10 for it 's more everyman style of diners , burger stores and bakeries			0
4 @entity33 home to the only @entity127 painting in the @entity1 the @entity128 is one of the main reasons to be proud in @entity33 as the capital , you would expect pride ( does it border on snobbery ? ) to be at the forefront of residents here			1
with the @entity139 , the president and the @entity141 all residing here , there 's plenty to shout about			0
but attractions such as the @entity145 's @entity144 , which offers free daily musical performances , is a reminder that @entity33 still has an egalitarian side			1
5 @entity149 the @entity150 and @entity151 in @entity152 give this elite @entity153 a real feeling of literacy			0
however , despite featuring high up the snobbery list , more annoyance may come with the fact that residents of @entity149 were discovered to be the worst drivers			0
hanging in in @entity162 with quizzers taking on clam pizzas , croissant - crumb - topped mac ’ n’cheese , and appropriately named cocktails like the @entity166 , made with gin , @entity168 , and maraschino liquor may help you fit in here			0
@entity33 has enough to take pride in , and residents do just that the @entity116 is something rather different in @entity30 and attracts an upper class crowd @entity149 has a solid footing in the university sphere and this is reflected in the city 's atmosphere 6 @entity181 @entity181 , a newcomer to the survey , made a dramatic entrance by ranking within the top 10 for snobbery , with the city 's cleanliness making residents particularly proud			1
every sophisticated city needs a @entity190 , and in @entity181 , it ’s @entity191 , where people can watch dolphins along @entity194			1
residents of @entity181 are particularly proud of its city 's cleanliness it ’s also where you ’ll find the @entity200 , which has a wine shop and a cheeky dessert shop called @entity203 , and faces local institution @entity204			0
7 @entity205 world class museums and theatres , including the @entity209 - designed @entity208 an innovative and popular city to reside in			0
the @entity211 offers something a bit different in @entity205 @entity205 has a rich history reflected in its art and museums locals are more ' coiffured ' than quirky , and this helped @entity205 into the top 10 after a few years out of the limelight			2
staying at the @entity220 on @entity221 , the boutique hotel @entity211 or shopping at @entity224 ’s @entity223 have long been hallmarks of good @entity205 living			2
8 @entity227 methodically sourced food , coffee , and wine , means locals have high standards when it comes to dining			0
a rise in technology development in @entity227 has helped create a high standard of living technology is also prevalent throughout @entity227 - you better make sure you have the latest gadget on your person			2
this sees the number of white - collar workers growing , as trade from the @entity247 develops			0
9 @entity248 the @entity250 - marble - laden @entity249 and the strollable ' 15 and 15 ' neighbourhood , where you ’ll find the @entity254 and the @entity255 are symbols of a bit of class about @entity259			0
@entity248 was ninth snobbiest - and yet second friendliest a strange stat is that even though they made ninth in the list of snobbiest cities , they also ranked second in terms of friendliness			0
in 2007 @entity248 was ranked by as the most vain city in @entity1 , based on the number of plastic surgeons per 100,000 and their spending habits on cosmetics			0
@entity273 the city ranked near the top for its notable restaurants such as @entity277 ’s and @entity281 ’s farm - to - table , from @entity280 nominee @entity278			0
the city also scored well for its gourmet food shops			0
@entity284 , @entity285 , is proud to be one of @entity1 's oldest cities it 's @entity289 affiliation with @entity290 is another reason for the @entity292 sneaking into the top ten			0
being one of the oldest cities in the @entity1 can also bring with it a spot of pride - as well as it being described as the ' creative capital ' and a hive of arts and entertainment .			2

luxury , art and shopping set the @entity5 apart but also make it ' snobby '
@entity3 apparently has the ' best looking people ' and comes in second
@entity30 , red carpet and all , trails in third spot *ahead* of @entity33
