@entity0 stands on the brink of driving in this weekend 's @entity3 @entity2 after @entity4 suffered another defeat in their legal battle with the @entity7			1
@entity8 was axed by @entity4 from his role as test driver at the end of last year as the @entity13 - based marque employed @entity14 and @entity15			2
but , with a contract from the team stating he was to be given a full - time seat for this season , @entity8 has pursued @entity4 through the courts these past few weeks			1
@entity0 , outside the @entity21 on wednesday , has charged @entity4 with reneging on a deal to give him a race seat after they signed @entity14 and @entity15 an arbitration panel in @entity13 initially ordered @entity4 ' to refrain from taking action ' that would deny @entity27 der @entity0 a drive			1
that decision was then upheld on wednesday by the @entity21 in @entity30 , @entity3 , following a hearing on monday			0
although @entity4 immediately launched an appeal , that has now been rejected following the latest hearing on thursday			2
at present , @entity27 der @entity0 is now pursuing an enforcement of the order to ensure @entity4 comply , which would result in the 29 - year - old taking part in first practice from 12.30pm local time on friday			1
@entity4 are now left with three drivers ; @entity8 , @entity14 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) for @entity4 team principal @entity41 , she has three drivers on her books , but only two seats available			1
should @entity41 ignore the ruling and opt to continue with @entity46 and @entity15 she and the team could find themselves in contempt of court			0
in pursuing the enforcement in a separate hearing and in front of a different judge less than an hour after the appeal verdict was handed down , van der @entity0 's lawyer called for the potential sequestration of @entity4 's assets and committal of its directors if the team failed to comply			1
@entity4 have since been asked to provide a list of those assets , which includes their cars and equipment at @entity68 's @entity67 in place for the race			1
court proceedings are due to continue at 10.30am local time ( 11.30pm @entity73 ) , just two hours before the start of first practice			0
@entity4 's failure to comply could result in the sequestration of their assets , and the possibility of action being taken against @entity41 given her position as a director			2
for his part , @entity27 der @entity0 is also attempting to acquire a valid and temporary super licence - required for any driver to compete in @entity86 - as the one in place for last season has since expired			1
the 29 - year - old must do so through his local motor - racing authority in @entity91 , who in turn contact world governing body , the @entity92			0
@entity8 had said he was looking forward to going back to the team and driving for them this weekend @entity98 has praised @entity27 der @entity0 's actions , claiming ' it is a good thing for all drivers ' speaking outside court , @entity27 der @entity0 said : ' @entity4 has to work with us now			1
there is no other issue			0
i 'm also confident the super licence can be fast - tracked			0
' former @entity4 driver @entity98 , now with @entity108 , speaking ahead of the appeal verdict , believes @entity27 der @entity0 had taken the correct steps to pursue his case via the legal system			1
@entity98 , speaking in the paddock at @entity68 's @entity67 , said : ' it should n't be the way people should be treating drivers			2
' a driver can be quite powerful			0
we are working here , we need the work , the career , so it 's not fair when people treat you the way he has been treated			0
it does n't matter if you are a driver or an engineer			0
' everyone should be treated fairly , and if there is a contract then that should be respected because there are rules and they have to be followed			0
' sometimes you hear stories in @entity86 of drivers having a contract with a team and they just get kicked out , or drivers who are owed money			2
' @entity0 is a good example			2
drivers should stand up for their rights , so i see it as a good thing for all drivers , but also anyone in @entity86 as they should be treated the same as any worker in the world			0

@entity4 lose appeal to block @entity0 's bid to force them to let him drive for them at first race of the @entity86 season in @entity68
@entity27 der @entity0 has accused @entity4 of reneging on deal to give him drive
@entity7 @entity8 claims he has a ' good *relation* with the team '
but it remains *unclear* whether he will drive in *sunday* 's season opener
