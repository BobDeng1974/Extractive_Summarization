by @entity0 those of you who walk or cycle home each night will have noticed a change in the air in the past couple of weeks			1
all of a sudden it is spring			0
after a winter battling through the wind , it is a joy to cycle home late on a balmy evening , long after the rush - hour commuters have left the roads			1
and so , a little over a week ago , having finished giving an evening lecture at @entity17 in central @entity18 , i was looking forward to the five - mile cycle home to @entity18			1
it had been a long day and a glass of wine beckoned			0
but as i approached the cycle racks of the university campus , i realised , with a sinking heart , that my bike was gone			1
a feeling of impotent rage overwhelmed me			0
back in the saddle : @entity0 with his stolen bike , which he tracked down and recovered via @entity32 six months earlier , my previous bike had been stolen , but that one was nearing its end and i ’d used a flimsy lock			1
it was an annoyance , but no great loss			0
in fact , i ’d had four bikes stolen in @entity18 — not to mention several wheels and bike light fittings			1
this one , though , was different			0
yes , it was a bog - standard bike , but it had been newly serviced and was purring with a fresh set of gears			1
i ’d used a strong lock in an area full of security guards			0
on a resentful train journey home , i cursed all bike thieves			2
that evening , i composed a sad moan and posted it on @entity52			0
i was immediately inundated with similar tales of woe			0
anyone i knew who cycled had had a bike — often several — stolen			1
my friend @entity58 consoled me with her own account of having her spanking new bike stolen when it was locked inside a bike shed at a @entity63 gym			1
scene : mr @entity0 's bike had been locked up in the racks outside @entity17 ( pictured ) in central @entity18 when she called the police , they told her to look on the second - hand websites @entity32 and @entity71			1
it only took a few minutes of searching for bikes for sale in her area to turn up her own			2
she told the police who advised her to set up a meeting with the thief on the pretext of wanting to buy it			2
the police would meet her there and make an arrest			1
but by the time she called the seller , he ’d already sold it — for £ 400			1
without much optimism , i began to search for bikes for sale on @entity32 in @entity18			1
and , voila ! the most recent bike to have been posted to the site looked just like mine			2
it was on sale for £ 90			1
the bike had originally cost me £ 200			1
i emailed my number to the seller and we arranged to meet on the street corner of @entity103 near @entity104 at 9.30pm			1
bike thieves , it did n’t surprise me to learn , prefer to operate from street corners , late at night			1
the seller , calling himself ‘ @entity110 ’ , was a 20 - something with a couple of scars on his face			1
he seemed friendly enough and let me take it for a spin			0
it certainly felt exactly like mine — same brakes , grips , bell , tyres , same quirks — but the street lights were too dim for me to see the markings and the bike was missing my rack , pedal clips and light fittings			1
i rode it for a while , but eventually decided i was only 75 per cent sure it was my bike			2
i did n’t want to accuse a potentially innocent young man of theft			2
reluctantly , i told @entity110 i would think about it			1
i was writhing with frustration by the time i arrived home			0
i was convinced i ’d been too forgiving			0
so i sent the @entity32 link to @entity142 , the man who originally sold me the bike			1
online advertising : without much optimism , mr @entity0 began to search for bikes for sale on @entity32 he noted that the gear shifts were different to the ones on the bike i ’d bought			1
did you have one of them changed ? ’ i had indeed , and the replaced gear matched the one in the picture			0
‘ then it ’s yours , ’ he said			0
‘ everything else is identical			0
and do n’t be put off by the rack			0
they always sell those separately			0
go get your property ! ’ this time , a different me was required			0
so that @entity110 would n’t suspect me , i needed a new name , phone number and voice			1
@entity166 , my younger daughter , declared that my various @entity168 accents were ‘ pathetic ’			0
the best i could come up with was a gruff @entity169			0
i was also worried @entity110 would recognise me , so i disguised myself with my running club ’s bobble hat and wrap - around sunglasses			1
that night , i told my students where i was going			0
‘ what if he stabs you ? ’ asked one as i was leaving			0
i remembered a scene in the @entity168 cop series @entity180 , where one of the characters uses a magazine inside his shirt to protect his stomach from knife wounds			0
so i added a magazine and a small paperback to each inside pocket of my leather jacket , just to be safe			0
glancing in the mirror , i could n’t help but think i looked a bit of a prat			0
this time , a more cautious @entity110 arrived			1
he told me that the bike was locked a short walk away and took me through a rough - looking housing estate			1
‘ have n’t i seen you before ? ’ he asked suspiciously			0
‘ not that i recall , ’ i answered in my @entity169 accent			0
‘ i just want to buy a bike for my son			2
’ @entity110 ’s greed for the £ 90 was enough to set aside his doubts			1
he unlocked the bike — my bike — and my anger bubbled up			2
‘ you ’re a thieving piece of scum ! ’ i said , returning to my normal accent and removing my hat and sunglasses			0
‘ this bike is stolen , and it ’s mine ! ’ theft : according to the @entity215 , an astonishing 14,079 bicycle thefts were reported in @entity18 between june and december last year ( file picture ) he must have been taken aback by this odd , little , middle - aged man ranting at him , but after a few seconds of nose - to - nose silence , he rallied			1
‘ prove it ! ’ he demanded			0
i went through the identifying markers , @entity142 had pointed out to me			0
but @entity110 was having none of it			1
‘ did you see me steal it ? hey ? hey ? ’ he yelled			0
‘ if i had seen you trying to steal it , it would n’t have been stolen			2
anyway , you ’re selling a stolen bike , which is a crime			1
we can go together to the police			2
’ ‘ or ? or ? ’ he asked			0
‘ or i ’ll take it with me right now			0
’ ‘ take it , ’ he said , rather to my astonishment			0
he was clearly desperate to get away without the police getting involved			2
‘ but what about my rack ? it was a new rack			0
’ ‘ the other guys took it , ’ he said , abandoning any pretence that the bike had n’t been stolen			1
‘ i just sell the bikes			0
’ once home , i contacted the administrative team at @entity32 to report @entity110 , who , by then , had removed the ad			1
they took a note of his details so that he could n’t sell any further stolen property on the site			2
with my bike safely locked in the flat , i did some research			2
according to the @entity215 , an astonishing 14,079 bicycle thefts were reported in @entity18 between june and december last year			1
this , of course , is only a small proportion of the true total because most victims do n’t bother to report their loss			2
but by head of population , the bike - theft capital of @entity263 may well be @entity264 where my elder daughter , @entity265 , had two well - locked bicycles stolen in one year			1
in the two months up to march 14 this year , 2,335 @entity264 bikes were reported as stolen			1
that ’s nearly 40 each day			0
a contemporary of my daughter ’s at @entity264 had an experience not unlike mine			0
after having her bike stolen from outside the theology faculty , she looked at @entity32 in the hope of finding a cheap replacement			1
there , brazenly offered for sale , was her own bike			1
she contacted the seller and asked to meet him			1
she then enlisted two friends — both rangy oarsmen from the college rowing crew — to go with her to meet the seller			1
at first , he ’d tried to get her to meet him on a housing estate outside the city , but she insisted on a main road near to her own college			2
the moment the thief saw the two boys he was cagey and suspicious			0
he wanted to know why she had brought friends			0
when she confronted him about the bike and told him it was hers , he turned aggressive , shouting at her and calling her a liar			2
then , before the others had time to react , he jumped on the bike and made a dash for it			2
the students reported the incident to the police , but the bike was never returned			1
the thief had used various false email addresses when he ’d set up his @entity32 account and could n’t be traced			2
with the knowledge that most thieves get away with it , i reported @entity110 to the police , who , rather to my surprise , came to my flat			1
as he was leaving , one of the constables offered some advice : ‘ next time , use two locks			0
and if it still gets stolen and you find it on @entity32 , phone us first			1
it ’s safer that way			0
’ my advice would go further			0
mark your bike in some way that only you know			2
if it is stolen , look on @entity32 and @entity71			1
contact the seller swiftly and arrange to meet			2
let the police know what you plan to do			2
but what i ’d really like to say is that if you know the bike is yours , you should ask to give it a test ride , then make your getaway , cycling furiously for home , leaving the thief in the dust			0
the bobble hat , sunglasses and fake @entity168 accent are , of course , optional .			0
