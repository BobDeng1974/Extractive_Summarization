by @entity0 published : 01:34 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 04:32 est , 5 march 2013 pressure : man @entity3 winner @entity2 has said writers are under increasing pressure to include explicit sex scenes in books novelist @entity2 said yesterday writers were under increasing pressure to include explicit sex scenes in books			1
but by writing graphically about intercourse , novelists were increasingly at risk of being ‘ laughed at by future generations ’			1
the widely - acclaimed @entity16 author , 67 , listed the three cardinal sins of bad sex writing as being too pornographic , too facetious or overly solemn			2
‘ @entity21 ’ cliches used by modern writers included characters wearing the ‘ wrong underpants ’ and ‘ humiliating attacks of impotence ’ , @entity2 said in an interview			1
he said that @entity28 literature ‘ grew up ’ and began to write more detailed sex scenes , after the failure of the @entity32 obscenity trial in 1960 , he said in the @entity33			2
but ‘ old euphemisms ’ had sometimes been replaced by ‘ misleading new cliches ’ and a commercial obligation to write about sex in detail , the @entity3 winner said			2
@entity2 , who won the @entity3 in 2011 with @entity40 , said that the fear that readers might think an author was writing from personal experience could be ‘ a great inhibitor ’			2
‘ i remember @entity46 telling me some time in the 1980s that he had recently abandoned a novel because there was a homosexual character in it and he was afraid “ the chaps at the club might think i was queer ” , he said			0
‘ this seemed , even at the time , a pitiful excuse , and seems the more pitiful with hindsight			0
’ @entity2 admitted that the comic approach was popular with writers because they would not be accused of ‘ solemnity ’ or ‘ moralising ’			1
@entity32 : @entity28 literature ' grew up ' after the failure of the @entity32 obscenity trail , said mr @entity2 but he added : ‘ the comic tone inevitably pushes you towards bad sex			1
it ’s ... perhaps impossible , to be funny about good sex , but with bad sex the field is wide open			0
‘ that embarrassing premature ejaculation , that humiliating attack of impotence , the wrong underpants , the social uncertainty of what and where and when and how and how often			0
this is safe territory for the novelist - perhaps too safe			0
’ he added another concern was vocabulary , ‘ which parts do you name , and what names do you give them ? ’ @entity2 , who talks about the challenges of writing about sex on @entity83 ’s the essay : explaining the @entity85 , added : ‘ @entity86 is a writer whom i revere , and who wrote with precision and understanding about sex , especially from the male point of view			1
‘ but in one novel - i think it was @entity94 - he kept comparing the male member - as he would n’t have called it - to a yam			0
‘ whenever he did so , instead of my visualising all the more clearly the sex that just was about to happen , i kept imagining a vegetable stall			0

writers feel increasingly obliged to include explicit sex , says @entity2
left authors at risk of being ' laughed at by future generations ' , he said
