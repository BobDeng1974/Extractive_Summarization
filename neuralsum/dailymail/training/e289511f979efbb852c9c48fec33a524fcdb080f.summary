by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 19:10 est , 9 august 2013 a six - foot boa constrictor has escaped from its owner ’s garden , causing trepidation among neighbours			1
just days after headlines about two boys strangled to death by a python in @entity11 , the snake gave its owners the slip and slithered out of their @entity15 garden			1
the reptile , called @entity17 , was described as ‘ hungry ’ and there were fears for the safety of family pets			1
pet : a snake ( pictured ) is on the run having escaped from a garden in @entity26 , @entity15 and it has n't been fed for two weeks it has n’t eaten for nearly a fortnight and was due to be fed when it made its break for freedom			1
normally the boa constrictor eats large rats			2
owner @entity34 said @entity17 was generally non-threatening , but urged her neighbours to be on their guard as the snake may snack on their pets			1
she said : ‘ @entity39 are notoriously greedy			2
if she starts to get hungry i am concerned she might go for small animals like rabbits or a cat			1
’ on monday brothers @entity46 , 7 , and @entity47 , 5 , were strangled to death as they slept , by a 13ft pet python which escaped from its enclosure in @entity52 , @entity11			2
missing : @entity34 with the cage used to home a 6ft boa constrictor she owns with her partner @entity56 mrs @entity34 , 32 , said @entity17 , who is two - and - half - years - old , was basking in the family garden in @entity26 when it escaped while they ate dinner			1
the family often leave the pet in the garden to warm up in the sunshine and say it normally ‘ never goes anywhere ’			1
they suspect the reptile slithered out of their fully - fenced garden through a tight gap between their house and a neighbouring property			1
@entity17 was only left alone for half - an - hour			2
after an hour of frantic searching the couple called police who have now joined the snake hunt			2
home : @entity17 slithered away from this garden and has n't been seen since			1
she might eat a cat or a rabbit upset : @entity34 holds the skin from her snake @entity17 to illustrate how long she is mrs @entity34 , a former dinner lady , said her children were distraught			1
‘ we just want her back now , there has been a few tears from the girls			0
they love her to bits			0
’ boa constrictors are not poisonous , but their bite can be painful			0
after catching its prey a boa will then ‘ constrict ’ its catch , effectively squeezing it to death , before swallowing it whole			0
mrs @entity34 ’s husband , @entity56 , said @entity17 is placid around the couple ’s three young children and is ‘ fine with my five - year - old holding her ’			2
