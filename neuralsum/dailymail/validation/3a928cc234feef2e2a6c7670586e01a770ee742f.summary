@entity1 defender @entity0 admits he has a difficult decision to make about his future			1
the @entity6 international 's current deal expires this summer and while there have been talks over extending his stay , nothing has yet materialised			1
@entity0 , 34 later this month , remains hopeful an offer will be forthcoming but even if it is he has a tough choice to make as to whether to stay on in the knowledge he will only be a squad player or to make the most of his remaining time in the game by looking for regular football elsewhere			1
defender @entity0 ( left ) is hoping a new contract offer to stay at @entity1 will be forthcoming @entity0 ( right ) hit the post with a header in the second half as @entity1 drew 0 - 0 with @entity23 on sunday @entity0 predicts that @entity24 will go on and become a ' king ' at @entity26 after his impressive displays ' we are still talking to the club			1
we will see in a few days			2

i need to do the right thing for me and my family			1
' whether @entity0 ultimately stays on as a player at @entity1 or not he has predicted a brilliant future for his successor @entity24 , who he believes will become a ' king ' at @entity26 last week manager @entity47 claimed the @entity48 under - 21 international will develop into a world - class asset for the club and now @entity0 has echoed those sentiments			1
can endured a difficult adaptation period following his Â£ 10million summer move from @entity55 and a lengthy injury lay - of contributed to him featuring in just nine matches - most as substitute - up until @entity59			0
however , somewhat fortuitously he found himself thrown on as a third centre - back at @entity61 on @entity62 and has never looked back , starting every match since and often moving into midfield - his preferred position - to provide cover			0
his performances have led to some suggesting he has all the credentials to one day captain the side and @entity0 has no doubts about the 21 - year - old 's quality			1
' he is a top player			0
he has been playing outstandingly at the back and in midfield he is a very strong player , ' said the @entity77 winner			0

' he is young but really good			0
when you are on the pitch you can see by the way he plays he is really confident and he talks on the pitch as well			0
' right now @entity94 is very good ( as captain ) but there is no doubt this boy is going to be a king here because he is a top player and can make a difference on games			1
' he can score goals , his work - rate is amazing and there is no better player			0
