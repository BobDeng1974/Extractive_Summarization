by @entity0 published : 18:35 est , 16 november 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 17 november 2013 stamp of approval : the @entity3 have decided to commemorate @entity4 with a set of stamps ahead of the bicentenary of his birth in december following calls from @entity10 a commemorative set of stamps will honour @entity4 – the @entity13 novelist who introduced the pillar box to @entity15 – after an intervention by @entity10			1
the @entity3 is to produce the stamps as part of celebrations to mark the bicentenary of the author ’s birth in 2015			1
the decision comes just days after it said it had no ‘ current ’ plans to produce a stamp in response to a freedom of information request from this newspaper			0
last night a @entity3 spokesman said the organisation had decided to look again at the issue in the light of @entity10 ’s original request and subsequent enquiries			1
@entity4 is best known for his @entity34 and @entity35 series of novels – and his stories of political and ecclesiastical intrigue have made him essential bedtime reading for politicians , peers and members of the clergy			0
his fans include @entity46 former prime minister sir @entity45 , @entity48 creator @entity47 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
any failure by the @entity3 to honour the writer – who was also a leading figure with the @entity13 postal service – would have been a public relations disaster			2
lord @entity47 said : ‘ i am so glad to hear that the @entity56 now intends to mark his double centenary			0
it would have been odd if they had not			0
‘ i can think of no other instance where a world - famous , front - rank novelist has introduced a @entity15 icon in an entirely different area of our national life			2
’ he added : ‘ the first pillar boxes were tried in @entity15 – after he had seen them used in @entity70 – in 1852 , at the urging of @entity4 , who was then a @entity56 employee			1
‘ the red pillar box is still with us and has long since moved into the company of other @entity15 icons , like the double - decker bus and @entity77			1
’ novelist @entity4 introduced the ubiquitous red pillar box , now a @entity15 icon , in 1852 while working for the @entity56 @entity4 was 19 when he joined the @entity56 as a clerk and he wrote as he rose through its ranks to surveyor			1
@entity83 , chairman of the @entity84 , welcomed the u-turn and said : ‘ the society feels very strongly the bicentenary of his birth in 2015 would be an appropriate time to remedy this serious omission			0
’ a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ @entity3 receives hundreds of requests each year for subjects of stamps			2
‘ clearly , we ca n’t satisfy all of these			0
but we have given further consideration to @entity4 , a notable @entity15 author , but also a former employee of ours			2

@entity3 will commemorate novelist @entity4 with a set of stamps to mark the bicentenary of his birth in december
the author introduced the ubiquitous red pillar box to @entity15 in 1852
honour comes following enquiries from @entity10
