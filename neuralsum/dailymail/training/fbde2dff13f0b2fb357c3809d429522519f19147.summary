new figures show that 14 police forces in @entity2 have seen increased numbers of call - outs related to dementia patients at care homes police are routinely being called to restrain dementia patients in care homes because poorly trained staff can not cope , it emerged last night			1
the ‘ deeply concerning ’ trend is the knock - on effect of a lack of investment in care staff training and the increasing use of agency staff , charities say			1
at least one force has sent officers to attend a residential home armed with @entity22 and riot gear – but did not have to use them after negotiating with the patient			0
another force was accused of leaving a confused patient covered in bruises and treating him like a ‘ common criminal ’ after using ‘ fast straps ’ – unbreakable plastic ties for the wrists and legs usually used on violent criminals			0
chief constables claim they are becoming an ‘ extension of the @entity41 ’ and are spending increasing amounts of time responding to problems that were once dealt with by social services and the health service			0
figures obtained under the @entity43 reveal that 14 police forces have seen increased numbers of call - outs related to dementia patients , which in some cases involved the use of handcuffs			1
the numbers of @entity54 – orders which allow dementia patients to be sedated , restrained or locked in a room for their safety – granted after requests by hospitals and care homes doubled between 2009/10 and 2012/13 , figures from the @entity52 showed			1
but , while 6,355 restraint orders were applied for , only 2,979 were granted			0
last night @entity64 , of the @entity65 , said : ‘ this is deeply concerning			2
we have noticed that there has been an increase in numbers in terms of the police being called out to address similar situations			1
‘ this is something that should be concerning to the police , too – they are becoming an additional part of social services and in many cases we believe the involvement of police is unnecessary			2
’ ' with four out of five elderly care home residents suffering from some form of dementia , it was ‘ absolutely essential ’ all staff were properly trained , mr @entity64 added			1
‘ in effect , what we are experiencing in terms of our social care is a system which has n’t significantly invested in its workforce for many , many years			1
many homes are staffed by agency staff and not always fully equipped to deliver the best quality care			1
police have been called to care homes across @entity2 , including @entity98 in @entity99 , to restrain dementia patients			1
@entity64 , of the @entity65 , said the trend was ' deeply concerning ' ‘ there are different ways of dealing with this sort of behaviour and preventing it in the first place			1
training staff and being more understanding about the person , treating them as individuals , means understanding what caused the behaviour			2
it may be that they are struggling to communicate that they are in pain			0
’ @entity119 chief constable @entity118 said the force was having to recruit volunteer special constables to cover a 14 per cent cut in officer numbers at a time when half of police time was being spent on ‘ safeguarding issues ’ such as dealing with people who are mentally ill or vulnerable children in care			1
she said : ‘ crime is only a tiny part of what we do			0
friday afternoon becomes very busy			0
other services that are not 24 - hour go down over the weekend – the police end up picking up			2
’ inspector @entity136 , of @entity137 , said his team was called to a residential home at least once a week to restrain patients , including one occasion when they went equipped with @entity22 and riot gear			1
writing in his @entity144 blog , he said ‘ earlier intervention ’ would prevent police involvement in most cases			2
he added : ‘ what we bring that others do not is batons and handcuffs ; @entity22 and @entity155 spray – and arguably , that is all			0
‘ the legal powers we would have available to us are also equally available to others , the human ability to talk is not monopolised by the police			2
’ he was concerned there were ‘ more and more ’ incidences of police being called on to use force on passively resistant patients , adding that police were ‘ sucked into the vacuum created ’ by a lack of properly trained care staff			1
sir @entity169 , chief constable of @entity170 , said last year the problem had grown so large police were now an ‘ extension of social services ’			2
the equivalent of 400 officers in his force a year are taken away from traditional duties to deal with people who have mental health issues			0
a significant number of them are dementia patients			1
‘ we have seen a number of incidents where we feel our officers are called inappropriately to care homes and the wards of hospitals to try to restrain patients , ’ sir @entity169 said			1
@entity193 , 58 , ( pictured with wife @entity194 ) was restrained using ‘ straps ’ after becoming agitated an @entity197 's patient was restrained by police and ‘ treated like a common criminal ’ , his wife claimed last night			2
former it consultant @entity193 , 58 , was restrained using ‘ fast - straps ’ after becoming agitated at @entity98 , near @entity99			0
his wife @entity194 , 59 , a local authority employee , said : ‘ we ’ve only ever had two parking tickets between us and yet in a vulnerable state he was restrained by police			0
it must have been so frightening for him			0
‘ the police are n’t dementia specialists so why are they being used to deal with people who have a medical condition ? you put someone in a home believing they are able to cope			2
’ mrs @entity215 received a call from the home saying police had been called , but that her husband would not be charged ‘ this time ’			1
she said : ‘ i could n’t believe it			0
how could they consider charging a man who did n’t know what he was doing ? ’ 600,000 volunteer to become sufferers ’ friends nearly 600,000 volunteers have signed up to a scheme to support dementia sufferers			0
the @entity230 campaign – backed by health secretary @entity231 – is aimed at increasing understanding of the everyday difficulties faced by people with dementia and has trained businesses and individuals to recognise the condition			0
it was set up by @entity240 and the @entity65 last year , with the backing of author sir @entity242 , 66 , who was diagnosed with early - onset alzheimer ’s in 2007			0
it aimed to sign up one million people by may next year , with the hope that their understanding will make life easier for dementia patients			1
businesses including @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , catering firm @entity254 and advertisers @entity256 have all signed up to train their staff under the scheme			0
mr @entity231 is expected to call for more businesses to get on board today when he speaks at a @entity262 event			0
by 2015 , there will be 850,000 people with dementia living in the @entity2 and this is expected to rise to one million in the next decade .			1
