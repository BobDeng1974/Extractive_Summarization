@entity11 , who began stocking raw treats in local cafes and photographing them , only realised the serious demand for her sweet treats when she reached 80,000 followers within a year			1
healthy hippy : @entity11 said her choc bars satisfy her , even though she grew up on @entity66 and @entity67 @entity19 treats : ' i always crave something after dinner , so these @entity19 bars still give me the same satisfaction ' ' they just loved that i was portraying healthy versions of the chocolates they knew and loved			1

' @entity85 shares her top substitutes to eat healthy sweet treats ... 1			1
swap sugar for ... rice malt syrup ' it 's derived from brown rice and is milled down until it becomes syrup			0
swap caramel for ... nut butters ' i will mix almond butter with tahini , coconut oil and dates			0
swap flour for ... nut meal ' when making a biscuit base i like to use a mix of walnuts and almond meal ' 4			0

swap butter for ... coconut oil as a self - proclaimed chocoholic who grew up on a diet of @entity67 and @entity66 , @entity85 knows what those with a sweet tooth expect , but ever since she converted to healthy versions , she 's never looked back			2
' i always crave something after lunch or dinner , i get a sugar rush - we all need it			0
but i still get the same feeling having one of my @entity19 bars			1

but once you cut all the bad sweets and find healthy replacements there 's no reason to go back			0
' for @entity85 , her main criterion for all her chocolate bars are that they are beautiful tasting , using simple ingredients , easy to make , familiar to her followers and have a ' feel good ' taste factor			2
