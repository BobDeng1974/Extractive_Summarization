@entity0 insists @entity1 will not risk their @entity3 aspirations by embarking on another gruelling pre-season travel schedule			1
the @entity5 blamed last summer ’s money - spinning programme of games in the @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 for a damaging 4 - 1 qualifying defeat to @entity12			1
@entity1 command lucrative fees for pre-season commitments and have also taken on trips to @entity16 and the @entity17 in recent seasons			1
@entity0 and @entity19 walk off the pitch after losing to @entity12 in @entity3 qualifying a return to @entity8 for this july has not yet been ruled out			1
with £ 16million on offer just for returning to the @entity3 group stages , however , @entity0 says he has the blessing of chief executive @entity26 to scale down this summer ’s commitments			1
‘ it is not going to be the same , ’ he said			2
‘ we are going to play less games , travel less and really prepare for those games			0
‘ i want to do it differently than we did it last year			0
i think we did way too much travelling and way too much games			0
’ faced with over-turning the 4 - 1 first leg defeat in @entity37 last summer , @entity0 remained with his first team in @entity39 while a @entity1 development squad suffered a 6 - 1 thrashing to @entity42 in an exhibition game at @entity45 ’s @entity44			1
‘ it is not positive to play games with half a team and lose 5 - 1 and 6 - 1 , ’ said the @entity1 boss			2
‘ it is not positive for the confidence and the atmosphere in the club			2
we do n’t like to lose			0
when we play we want to prepare as well as possible and that is going to be the main issue now in pre-season			2
’ a @entity1 development squad were thrashed by @entity42 in a pre-season friendly last season the @entity60 champions recently secured a new kit deal with @entity8 manufacturers @entity62 , raising the chances of a return to the @entity8			1
despite the financial attractions of a packed pre-season programme , however , @entity0 says he has backing from @entity26 to do most of the preparation in @entity68			1
‘ he is with me			0
we are on the same lines so that has n’t been a problem			0
we are talking about the @entity8 but then everything has to be perfect there			2
‘ we have n’t decided 100 per cent but i think we are going to stay here for the first 14 days and have games around here			0
we will have a couple of games that we go away to play , maybe two or three			0
so less travelling , more calm			0
players will have been abroad on vacation and will come back and prepare the right way and play games here			0
’ acknowledging at the same time that overseas trips generate cash for the club , @entity0 responded : ‘ yes , but there is more money in the @entity3			1
’ @entity0 says @entity1 wo n't be travelling as much in pre-season as they look to qualify for the group stages			1

@entity1 travelled to the @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 last pre-season
the @entity68 club were then *beaten* in the @entity3 by @entity12
