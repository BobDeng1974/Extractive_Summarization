@entity0 is refusing to ' dream ' of seeing his @entity3 team crowned @entity5 champions for the first time on saturday night			1
the @entity7 have been installed as favourites to replace @entity9 as champions on a climatic final round that will conclude with @entity12 visiting @entity13 , yet they could finish as low as fourth in the table			1
@entity9 and @entity15 are also in the hunt with the staggered kick - offs - starting in @entity18 at 12.30pm and concluding when @entity3 take the field at 5pm - ensuring a nerve - jangling afternoon awaits			1
@entity3 coach @entity0 watches from the stands as his side beat @entity23 at @entity13 @entity3 skipper @entity24 could get his hands on the @entity5 trophy after lifting the @entity27 for a third successive year the title is set to be decided by points difference with @entity3 's cushion over the @entity31 of plus four placing them in pole position , although they arguably have the toughest fixture , even allowing for @entity12 's dismal record at @entity13			1
@entity0 is desperate to lift the first piece of major silverware of his reign but having finished runners - up for the last three years , the head coach is acutely aware of how best laid plans can be foiled			2
' to win at @entity13 would mean a huge amount , - for the players and the fans , ' he said			1
@entity46 passes the ball during @entity3 's training session at @entity49 @entity3 's @entity50 in action during the team 's practice session in @entity54 on monday @entity55 passes the ball as the team practice at their headquarters in @entity54 @entity59 runs with the ball during @entity3 's practice session at their @entity49 base @entity3 coach @entity0 oversees his team 's training session on monday in @entity65 ' i know how much hard work people have put in and also how much it hurt to come second for three years in a row			1
' but you ca n't start thinking about things like that until you get the detail of the game right			0
we 've got a huge challenge coming our way from @entity12			2
' they 're a high quality team - very big and physical			2
as they showed last year when they played @entity9 , they played right through for the full 80 in that last game even though they could n't win the championship			2
' it could still be the case they have something to play for , so we wo n't start dreaming yet , we 'll get our detail right			0
' @entity3 stepped up their preparations for their final @entity5 clash with @entity12 @entity3 coach @entity0 addresses the media at the @entity93 in @entity54 @entity94 tries to tackle @entity95 during @entity3 's training session on monday @entity3 forward @entity97 speaks at a press conference on monday in @entity54 @entity3 head into the final weekend of the @entity5 atop the table on points difference the schedule has presented @entity3 with the significant advantage of knowing exactly what their target will be against @entity12 when the last game of the 2015 @entity5 kicks off			1
@entity0 will inform his players of the results of @entity15 ' clash with @entity110 in @entity18 and @entity9 's match against @entity23 at @entity112 , but insists their over-riding ambition on must be to secure victory rather than chase a score			1
' there are lots of hypotheticals			0
you do n't know how the other two games will play out			0
clearly we 'll know the outcome before we start , which is an advantage on last year , ' he said			0
' we were in a similar position going into the @entity110 game last year when we knew points difference would decide it			0
the challenge for us was to score as many points as we could			0
@entity3 players @entity135 ( left ) , @entity130 ( centre ) and the @entity133 brothers pose with the @entity27 @entity136 scored @entity3 's late try which put them top of the @entity5 standings on points difference ' the emphasis on saturday will be the same as that day - to get the performance right first and foremost			1
' it 's impossible to insulate the players from the results of the previous games because 82,000 people are shouting it at them when they run on to the field			0
' but the critical thing is to ensure the players are all completely focussed on their own preparations leading into the game			0
' by the time the @entity9 game finishes we 'll know what the objective is and will feed that through to the key decision - makers			2
' everyone else should be concentrating on their job to get a win for the team			0

@entity0 's side beat @entity23 *25* - 13 at @entity13 last saturday
@entity3 , @entity9 and @entity15 can all win the @entity5 title on saturday
