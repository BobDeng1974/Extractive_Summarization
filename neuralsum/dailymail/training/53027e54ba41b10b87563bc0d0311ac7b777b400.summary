passion : mother - of - three @entity1 has re-discovered the joy of sex four times a week			1
if i told you i ’m a 43 - year - old mother of three children under ten and that ’s how many times i make love to my husband ( and no , i do n’t mean begrudgingly ) , would you believe me ? @entity10 , as little as six months ago i ’d have rolled my eyes in disbelief , too			1
well , it ’s true : i have stumbled upon a little - known fact			1
and like any good evangelist , i ’m keen to spread the word			1
speak to any mother of young children and she ’ll undoubtedly tell you that intimacy with her husband is not on her list of priorities			1
not for nothing does one of my friends call it the ‘ last job of the day ’			1
i used to be like this			1
i could eke out our sexual droughts for months , but my hubby @entity32 , 45 , would eventually get snappy and i ’d have to give in			1
but the truth i ’ve discovered is that having children eventually makes your sex life even better			1
i ’d go so far as to say that with a bit of work it can trigger a second honeymoon			1
it ’s like having sex at your parents ’ house ; the furtiveness makes it all the more thrilling , and those thrills bring you closer together			1
in many ways , our sex life is better now than when we first met			1
we know each other better , we ’re more experienced and our love life has been transformed			1
i met @entity32 at a wedding when i was 29 and he was 31			1
as clichéd as it might sound , it was love at first sight			1
the trouble was he lived in @entity59 and i worked at a music management company in @entity61 , so we could see each other only at weekends			2
the passion was palpable every time we were reunited			2
it was n’t long before we moved in together in @entity65 , @entity66 , and by the time we married in september 2002 , we ’d spoken about having children , which was a good thing because i conceived on our wedding night			2
but i did n’t find pregnancy easy			2
my skin erupted and i piled on three stone			2
for the first time in my life , i ’d look in the mirror and recoil			2
and it ’s true what they say about the link between a woman ’s self - confidence and her libido			1
but @entity32 was as frisky as ever			2
he ’d be all hands when i was vacuuming			2
instead of feeling flattered , i ’d swat him away			2
of course , things only worsened after our son @entity86 was born			2
i had an emergency caesarean			2
not only did i feel violated by the experience , it left me with angry scars across my tummy			1
then came the soul - drenching exhaustion of motherhood			2
@entity32 worked long hours at an environment consultancy , so that meant the vast majority of parenting and chores were left to me			2
i went from being a bouncy , flirty thing to an anxious , snappy creature who lived in a far from fetching t - shirt and tracksuit			2
however , @entity32 started getting amorous less than three months after the birth			2
when met by my distinctly cold shoulder , he ’d say : ‘ have you gone off me ? ’ i finally acquiesced after four months , with great reluctance			2
i just felt so unattractive and tired			0
sex four times a week : @entity1 and her beloved husband from then on , i ’d try to leave it as long as possible , but i ’d always give in eventually — usually in the missionary position and mainly because i did n’t want his needs being met elsewhere			1
after having children , a woman ’s needs become things such as her husband unloading the dishwasher or holding the baby			0
but a man ’s remain of the carnal variety			0
despite all of the above , i soon decided i wanted another baby			0
our daughter @entity126 was born in march 2005			0
@entity128 was the first thing to go again			0
and again , it only reappeared on my agenda when i decided on a third child			0
@entity32 was pleased we were active in the bedroom once more , but after our son @entity135 was born in november 2008 i really struggled with sex and my self - image			1
after a year of juggling three young children on my own , i found myself sobbing my heart out to my gp , who prescribed me anti-depressants			0
at last , @entity32 could see my froideur was n’t down to him			0
on one occasion , he even confessed he ’d feared i was having an affair			0
baby boom every day 120 million acts of sexual intercourse take place around the world — resulting in 910,000 conceptions now that he understood and supported me i could piece myself back together			0
within a year i was off the medication			0
by that time , i ’d built up a group of mummy friends and our main topic of conversation was how a house full of children left us doing all we could to avoid sex			1
but i knew my lovely husband deserved more			0
i wanted to satisfy him , but my confidence had been so shaken			0
could anything bring the fizz back ? after months of internal debate i took action			0
oddly enough , the trigger was a petty , domestic row			0
i stormed off with the joint credit card , determined to cheer myself up with some retail therapy			0
it was then that a lingerie store caught my eye — and i realised i ’d been wearing the same greying maternity bras for four years			1
what had i become ? @entity178 had always been a part of my character			0
now , a row was as near as we had got to passion in months			0
i found myself in the changing room trying on an exorbitantly expensive hot pink bra and knickers			0
i thought : ‘ i look all right ! ’ my breasts had changed and my hips were wider , but i ’d lost my pregnancy weight			0
i bought the undies and walked out of the shop with a spring in my step			0
i was about to re-ignite a long - dormant spark			0
imitating art : @entity1 and her husband once tried to copy a @entity197 plot by having sex every day for a week the next week , when i confessed to my girlfriends that i ’d decided to make the earth move again , they advised me to try waxing			1
the next day i had a @entity203 and it made me feel brilliant			1
and so , that night , while @entity32 was putting the children to bed , i changed into my new undies and slipped into bed			0
instigating sex for the first time in years was such a turn - on			1
when he saw me in bed , @entity32 ’s mouth dropped open			0
it was the best sex we ’d had in years			1
it felt like those early days when all that mattered was us			0
my libido had been kick - started			1
seeing how happy it had made us , i came up with a plan inspired by @entity197			0
i decided we should try to have sex every day for a week			1
and while we managed only three nights — exhaustion , tv and a tummy bug got in the way — we had fun trying			0
i realised what i ’d been missing : how making love unites a couple			0
the next morning we were far more demonstrative in our affections			0
sex is like going to the gym : you might not fancy it to start with , but once you make the effort , you get addicted			1
it became a naughty secret between us — we ’d send each other sexy texts during the day and gaze at each other over dinner			1
i suddenly remembered what i ’d found so attractive about my husband			0
it felt so daring : adults frolicking in the same house as the children ! before we had children , the fact sex was on tap made us complacent			1
today , @entity32 is beaming and i ’ve adopted a bit of a wiggle			0
the effect on my confidence is such that i even bought a racy basque the other day — something i would never have dreamed of in my 20s			1
to all those who read this thinking ‘ if only ! ’ , i ’d stress that if i can do it — after three children and ten years of non-existent libido — anyone can			1
and believe me , you ’ll want to shout about it , too .			0

@entity1 , 43 , *rediscovered* joy of sex after ten years of non-existent libido
racy lingerie and @entity203 wax helped her feel sexy again
' it *'s* like going to the gym , once you make the effort , you get addicted '
