by @entity0 published : 16:57 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 17:21 est , 8 june 2013 from the great @entity3 painter @entity2 to the science - fiction writer @entity4 , history is packed with great visionaries who have obsessed over what life will be like in the future			1
these thinkers , with varying degrees of success , have tried to envisage such matters as how our modes of transport , means of communication and homes will look in years to come			0
@entity19 architect @entity18 joined this long line of visionaries when , back in the early 1990s , he entered a competition to design a house for the future			1
bright idea : the prize - winning property , on the market for £ 345,000 , was constructed to reflect what future dwellings would look like his glass - and - timber design triumphed and the house was built in a quiet cul - de - sac in the town of @entity35 between @entity36 and @entity37			1
fifteen or so years later , the decision of the competition ’s judges seems vindicated			0
the house , which stands amid rows of typical suburban houses in @entity45 ’s central belt , still resembles a home fit for the future			1
‘ we fell in love with it because it was different , ’ says @entity48 , 51 – who with his partner , childcare assessor @entity49 , 45 – has lived in the house since buying it in 2008			2
they have now decided to downsize to concentrate on his electrical - contractor business , and the property is on the market for offers in the region of £ 345,000			1
the dominating feature of the house is its glass atrium			2
besides the clear aesthetic value of this vast structure , @entity18 obviously realised that energy conservation would be a key concern for people in years ahead and designed this section with that in mind			1
open air : the atrium in the house , located between @entity36 and @entity37 , has a glass ceiling and a staircase leading to the mezzanine home office the air in the atrium is warmed by the sun , so the whole house can be heated by opening the doors adjoining this space , and there are vents in the glass roof to help control the temperature			1
thanks to this – plus the facts that the hot water pipes run under the floor and the walls are very well - insulated – @entity48 and @entity49 ’s heating bills are well below average for this area			2
in keeping with the sustainability theme , all the timber in the house came from managed forests and the pond in the garden is filled with rainwater that is collected from the roof			2
@entity48 has used his background as an electrical engineer to install a coloured lighting system so that the atrium is not just an impressive feature in the day			0
‘ the house takes on a completely different personality at night : it becomes soothing and calming and has almost a gothic castle feel , ’ says @entity49			0
besides this , the couple have done little to the house in the five years they have lived there , leaving @entity18 ’s vision to live up to its futuristic promise			1
they did , however , find the interiors were ‘ a little twee ’ when they bought it			0
‘ @entity123 were hiding the woodwork and brickwork and rugs were hiding the beautiful @entity128 flooring , ’ says @entity49			0
‘ we felt it needed updating to suit the architectural aspects of the house and its features , such as its high windows and ceilings			0
’ time to downsize : mr @entity48 and miss @entity49 in their home in @entity35 , which they have decided to sell for business reasons they say it is an ideal dwelling for social occasions with one side – which they jokingly refer to as the ‘ @entity144 ’ – containing three bedrooms and two bathrooms , while the rest of the property includes a variety of living areas from a dine - in kitchen to a home office , which sits on a mezzanine level			2
‘ it is a great house for parties , especially in the summer when you can fold back the glass wall in the atrium and allow your guests access to the garden , ’ says @entity49			2
and while their house may stand out from the rest in the area , the couple feel part of a warm community			0
‘ we have a great social life here			0
‘ our neighbours have become friends and we often get together for dinner			0
’ the house is also ideal for golf enthusiasts as it is situated in the middle of the @entity179 - designed @entity178 course			1
prospective buyers will also be interested to learn of the merits of @entity35 , which is a mere 25 - minute drive from @entity36 and , with its range of shops , restaurants and theatre , has plenty to offer in its own right			1
@entity189 of selling agents @entity190 says : ‘ this is an exceptional , award - winning home set in the heart of @entity178			1
‘ it must be viewed to be fully appreciated			0
