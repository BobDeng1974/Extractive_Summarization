@entity9 , a @entity88 originally from @entity89 , went into hiding after he was identified as the man behind the trailer			2
the full story about @entity9 and the film is still very unclear			1
the movie was made last year by a man who called himself @entity9			2
after the violence erupted , a man who identified himself as @entity9 called media outlets taking credit for the film and said it was meant to portray the truth about @entity7 and @entity101 , which he called a cancer			1
the next day , it emerged that ' @entity105 ' was in fact @entity9 , a former gas station owner with a drug conviction and a history of using aliases			2
federal authorities later confirmed there was no @entity9 and that @entity9 was behind the movie			0
