admission : former @entity3 @entity2 psychologist dr @entity4 the man at the centre of the @entity8 ’s brutal interrogation regime has revealed @entity10 agents were present at torture sites around the world where detainees were questioned			1
the admission by former @entity3 @entity2 psychologist dr @entity4 comes after an explosive report by the @entity16 appeared to go to great lengths not to implicate @entity18 or the @entity19 in the torture programme			1
@entity4 , 62 , who went by the @entity21 , not only personally carried out countless torture sessions including waterboarding , on detainees , but was also responsible for devising the methods used			1
he set up a company , @entity27 and associates , with former @entity2 colleague @entity29 , which was paid £ 50 million to run the @entity8 interrogation programme			2
last week , @entity31 asked him if @entity10 agents were present during his torture sessions , or were aware of the methods used			1
at first he said : ‘ you will have to ask the @entity8 about that			0
i was moving around a lot			0
’ he then admitted : ‘ i would see their [ @entity10 ] special operations people at the sites i would visit			1
’ the admission came as other allegations emerged pointing to @entity10 knowledge and collusion in the @entity8 ’s torture programme			1
an @entity19 agent who reported abuse of detainees in @entity48 by his @entity3 colleagues in 2002 to his superiors in @entity51 was ordered not to intervene , according to a memo			1
the telegram from ‘ @entity55 ’ to an agent working with the @entity3 in @entity48 in january 2002 said : ‘ it appears from your description that they may not be being treated in accordance with the appropriate standards			2
torment : a prisoner of @entity3 forces is bound and hooded in @entity64 following a raid in @entity66 ‘ given that they are not within our custody or control , the law does not require you to intervene to prevent this			2
’ the telegram emerged last year during a truncated inquiry headed by retired judge sir @entity76			0
sir @entity76 raised 27 a number serious questions over the @entity10 ’s involvement in the abduction and torture of terrorist suspects , and flagged up 40 cases needing ‘ particular attention ’			2
but the @entity76 probe was replaced by an inquiry by the parliamentary @entity88 , which may not report until 2016			0
former security minister @entity89 also acknowledged @entity10 agents could even have been present during torture			1
he said there may have been the ‘ odd case ’ where agents knew about torture and failed to alert their superiors			0
he told the @entity97 : ‘ would we – as we dug around and had some huge inquiry – find that one agent or maybe two agents were once in a room when somebody was waterboarded ? possibly we might			0
’ @entity4 and @entity29 , who also went by the name @entity105 , developed their murky skills at the @entity2 ’s @entity109 school , where they taught servicemen how to resist torture			2
their chance to turn the tables came when they became involved in the @entity8 ’s ‘ black site ’ torture programme in 2002 after @entity119 suspect @entity118 was arrested in @entity120			1
he was reportedly taken to @entity121 , where a prison known as ‘ detention site @entity123 ’ was set up			0
when he pitched to the @entity8 , @entity4 had proposed 12 key techniques to be used in interrogation : the attention grasp , [ of the detainee ’s collar ] ‘ walling ’ , [ forcing the detainee against a wall ] , facial hold , facial slap , cramped confinement , standing , stress positions , sleep deprivation , waterboarding , use of nappies , use of insects and mock burial			1
last week , @entity4 claimed his treatment of detainees did not constitute torture			0
‘ waterboarding is not torture , ’ he said			0
‘ if it was torture , why does the military subject thousands of service personnel to waterboarding as part of training ? ’			0

dr @entity4 was responsible for devising waterboarding methods
said : ' i would see ( @entity10 ) special operations people at sites i would visit '
comes as other allegations point to @entity10 knowledge of @entity8 programme
@entity19 agent who reported abuse by @entity3 was ordered not to intervene
lord @entity89 also said @entity10 agents could have been present during torture
report by @entity16 did not implicate @entity18 or @entity19
