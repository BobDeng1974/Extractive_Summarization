trained raptor : the 15 - year - old bird is owned by @entity23 , who said the incident was ' terrifying ' prepares to swoop : as the trained bird ( right ) soars through the @entity6 sky , a wild female golden eagle appears from above and begins to circle the smaller animal sent spinning : the wild female dives into the smaller trained male , who is sent tumbling through the air moves in for second attack : as the 4.5kg captive bird struggles to regain its composure , the wild golden eagle prepares to launch another assault ' i have quite a connection with her and my heart was in my throat when i saw she was being attacked by a wild male			1
