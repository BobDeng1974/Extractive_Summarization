by @entity0 published : 20:06 est , 26 may 2012 updated : 20:06 est , 26 may 2012 it was a very public death			1
in the grey light of dawn , the body of a man was found hanging from scaffolding underneath @entity6 in @entity7 , his feet dangling in the water			2
he was wearing an expensive @entity13 suit and his pockets were weighted with bricks and stuffed with cash			2
family moment : @entity13 financier @entity19 ( right ) and his son @entity20 in a picture taken by @entity20 's sister @entity22 in 1982 , the year @entity18 was found hanging under @entity6 in @entity7 initially police believed that @entity13 financier @entity19 , known as ‘ @entity25 ’s banker ’ because of his close financial ties with the @entity27 , had committed suicide			1
but the dead man ’s son , @entity29 , commissioned an independent forensic report , which concluded in october 2002 that he had been murdered			1
in 2005 , @entity13 prosecutors brought murder charges against five suspects but all were acquitted after the subsequent trial in @entity37			2
now , 30 years after his father was found dead , @entity20 remains convinced that he was murdered and wants police to reopen the case			1
@entity20 believes that up to a dozen men from the @entity13 underworld were involved in the murder – and claims many are still at large in @entity7			2
‘ a long time has passed since my father ’s murder on june 18 , 1982 , ’ he said			1
‘ it is not unrealistic to believe that there are individuals involved in his death still alive			1
i want the @entity53 to pursue these individuals and put them where they belong			2
it is a matter of public interest			2
these people are still operating in @entity7			2
we should all know who they are and what they are doing			2
’ ' crime scene ' : the jury at the second inquest in 1983 visit the spot where @entity19 was found hanging under @entity6 @entity20 , aged 58 and himself a former banker , has dedicated his life to seeking justice for his father , who was the chairman of @entity13 ’s second - largest bank , @entity68			1
the bank subsequently collapsed with debts of half a billion pounds amid dark rumours of laundered @entity73 drug money , a link with the clandestine ‘ @entity77 ’ masonic lodge and secret political slush funds			2
now living in @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity20 spends his time travelling between his home and @entity7 , @entity82 and @entity83 – sifting through evidence , meeting secretive contacts willing to talk about @entity13 organised crime and poring over the transcripts of @entity73 trials			2
his obsession with finding the men involved in his father ’s murder has come at a price – both financial and personal			1
he has spent £ 15 million on fees for lawyers , private detectives and other experts in an attempt to identify the guilty			1
and his marriage to @entity101 , mother of his two sons , @entity18 , 18 , and @entity103 , 16 , broke up in 2000			2
he has also not seen his sister @entity22 , 55 , a lecturer at @entity105 , since their mother ’s death from @entity109 in 2006			1
‘ there ’s no doubt i have fixated on the case , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’m sure that played a part in my divorce and it has affected my relationship with my sister			2
she does n’t necessarily agree with the things i have done			0
’ call to re-open case : @entity20 believes up to a dozen men from the @entity13 underworld were involved in the murder of his father ( pictured ) and claims many are still at large in @entity7 @entity20 was a 28 - year - old post-graduate student at @entity126 ’s @entity125 when he recieved the telephone call that would change his life			1
his mother @entity129 , then 60 , and sister @entity22 , 25 , were staying with him in @entity126 , having been warned by his father that their lives were in danger			1
‘ my mother had been living with me in @entity135 for about six weeks because my father feared for her safety , ’ he recalled			1
‘ my sister arrived the day before he died			0
we were awoken by the telephone in the middle of the night when my uncle @entity142 , my mother ’s brother , called from @entity144 to say that he had heard the news on the radio			0
‘ he spoke to my mother who had a complete breakdown			0
we had to call a doctor			0
i remember telling my uncle that he could have been more careful with his words			0
i think he was a little too direct			0
’ within hours the family had been escorted by @entity135 police to a secret apartment in the @entity156 complex , famous for the break - in that brought about the fall of president @entity159			0
they spent the next few weeks under police guard before returning to @entity20 ’s home			1
‘ my mother never recovered from my father ’s death , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ she and my father had always dreamed of living near @entity166			1
they were very close and she remained very attached to her dreams			0
‘ the following year , she suffered the first symptoms of @entity109 ’s			0
i do n’t think she got it as a direct result of my father ’s murder – but surely it does n’t help if you have lived through such a shock ? ’ @entity20 ’s quest for the truth began a month after his father ’s death when a @entity7 inquest recorded a verdict of suicide			1
it was hardly a likely explanation			0
six days before his death , @entity19 had shaved off his moustache and skipped bail in @entity13 pending an appeal against a four - year suspended prison sentence for illegally transferring £ 18 million out of the country			1
fearing for his life , the 62 - year - old banker chartered a private plane and fled to @entity194 on a false passport with sardinian business tycoon @entity196 , a long - term associate who assumed the role of bodyguard			1
he was taken to a safe house in @entity200 , @entity201 – believed to have been organised by another @entity203 businessman , @entity202			0
@entity19 had already written to @entity204 warning him of the imminent collapse of @entity68 , saying that it would ‘ provoke a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in which the @entity208 will suffer the gravest damage ’			1
@entity19 ( back left ) , known as ' @entity25 's banker ' because of close ties to the @entity27 , with other top @entity13 financiers who appeared in court in 1981 charged with illegal export of funds abroad @entity19 also had close links to the @entity73 , the @entity218 – a @entity73 - like criminal organisation based in @entity220 – and the @entity221			1
the latter was described by @entity19 ’s former @entity68 mentor , @entity224 @entity223 , as a ‘ state within a state ’ because of its powerful members , including former @entity13 prime minister @entity228			1
@entity20 refused to accept the 1982 inquest ’s suicide verdict			0
he hired one of @entity194 ’s best - known barristers , @entity233 , to represent the family at a second hearing , which recorded an open verdict			0
still not satisfied , he demanded that his father ’s body was exhumed			1
@entity20 then commissioned the independent forensic report , which concluded in october 2002 that his father had been murdered as the injuries to his neck were inconsistent with hanging , there was no trace of rust and paint on his shoes from the scaffolding and he had not touched the bricks in his pockets			2
in 2005 , @entity196 and @entity202 were accused of killing @entity19			1
but the duo and three others – mafia financier @entity253 , businessman @entity254 and @entity202 ’s girlfriend @entity255 – were acquitted 20 months later			0
another name linked to @entity19 ’s murder was @entity73 ‘ supergrass ’ @entity20 , known as ‘ @entity258 ’			1
determined : @entity29 ( pictured ) has dedicated his life to seeking justice for his father according to @entity20 , the killers were @entity263 and @entity264 of the @entity265			1
‘ @entity19 was naming names , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ no one had any trust in him any more			0
he owed a lot of money			0
his friends had all distanced themselves			0
everyone wanted to get rid of him			0
i was in @entity37 and received a phone call from a friend in @entity224 telling me that a certain high - ranking @entity73 member had just been killed			0
‘ i will never forget the date because of this : it was june 16 , 1982 – two days before @entity19 was murdered			1
the friend told me that @entity253 was trying to get hold of me because he needed me to do something for him , ’ @entity20 claims			0
‘ when i finally spoke to @entity253 , he told me not to worry , that the problem had been taken care of			0
‘ that ’s a code we use in the @entity73			0
we never talk about killing someone			0
we say they have been taken care of			0
’ @entity29 believes that the supergrass is telling the truth			1
he agrees with @entity20 that his father ’s killers were @entity263 – the second - in - command of the @entity218 , who was murdered by a car bomb in @entity37 in 1983 – and his sidekick @entity264 , who was stabbed to death three months after @entity19 ’s murder			1
@entity264 was also a former tenant of @entity19 ’s last known home , the rented flat at @entity200			1
@entity20 points out that both his father and @entity263 had business cards belonging to @entity301 , a @entity218 associate , in their possession when they died			2
‘ i ’m not suggesting @entity301 was involved , but he definitely connects to some of the individuals involved in the case , ’ @entity20 said			0
‘ when my father died , he had @entity301 ’s business card in his wallet			2
‘ one of the first people to ring us when we returned to the house after my father died was @entity301			2
in general , i consider @entity20 a reliable witness			0
but i am more interested in what he has to say about the social network of the @entity13 underground in @entity7 during the @entity319			0
’ it is that underground movement that @entity20 is now hoping will be exposed – even if his own safety is jeopardised			0
calling for a third inquest , he said : ‘ the police have already admitted it was murder but i would like to see the case reviewed in open court and the remaining defendants in their jurisdiction pursued			0
‘ when i lived in @entity13 i had bodyguards but now i have to rely on my own judgment and instinct			0
‘ there have been instances when i have been concerned for my safety but i try not to be confrontational and protect myself			0
‘ if the worst happens , i am not the only person who has this information			0
i will not rest until i find out the truth about my father ’s death			1
