there is a @entity2 takeover going on in @entity3			2
they might like the taste of a @entity6 , or the feel of drizzly rain so thick it soaks you through			0
or perhaps @entity10 are big on that side of the @entity12			0
whatever the answer , @entity2 are flocking to a city in the @entity15			2
the @entity3 derby on sunday will bring together potentially 11 players from @entity2 at @entity18 and @entity19 , ranging from @entity20 to @entity21 to @entity22			1
the @entity19 and @entity18 likely starting xis for the derby with @entity2 highlighted there could well be a record set for the most amount of @entity2 starting a @entity29 match – currently standing at seven in the fixture between @entity19 and @entity31 last year			1
the record amount to feature over the course of a game is eight , when @entity18 played @entity35 earlier this season			2
@entity37 takes a look at who they are and who is most likely to have the biggest impact on the match ... @entity43 ( @entity20 ) - @entity19 the striker has fired two blanks in his last two matches , but that has barely put a dent in his scintillating goalscoring form this season			1
eleven goals in 13 appearances in all competitions , eight in his last seven , joint - top scorer in the @entity29 with @entity55			2
he will be favourite to net the winner			0
@entity43 has been in good form for @entity19 and celebrates scoring against @entity31 @entity59 ( @entity20 ) - @entity18 seven games into his @entity18 career and @entity63 is already proving to be the man to pull the strings from midfield for his side – as well as wading in with three goals			1
the £ 60million summer signing will be crucial to @entity18 's chances of beating their bitter rivals			2
@entity20 star @entity59 ( left ) , who has reinvigorated @entity18 , tries to beat @entity72 @entity73 ( @entity22 ) - @entity18 we are yet to see much of the frightening finishing of the forward since he joined @entity18 , with only one goal so far			1
but those who have played with @entity73 speak of one of the most lethal penalty area strikers			0
there is a reason the 28 - year - old has commanded more than £ 100m in fees			0
@entity73 could return from injury to play in his first @entity3 derby @entity87 ( @entity21 ) - @entity19 the @entity21 has been shouldering the burden of @entity90 's passive displays this season			1
his box - to - box running has tried to create the energy to drive @entity19 forward as well as providing cover at the back			0
they will need him to run tirelessly , yet again , if @entity90 fails to perform			0
@entity21 midfielder @entity87 is likely to partner @entity90 in midfield for @entity19 analysts @entity99 predict that a @entity19 win is the most likely outcome against @entity18 @entity102 ( @entity20 ) - @entity19 on his day , @entity102 can be as dangerous as any winger from right back			1
he has the stamina to get up and down that flank for the entire 90 minutes and pose a real threat to @entity18 's goal , as well as proving just as difficult to beat at the back			0
@entity102 ( right ) will be a threat for @entity19 up and down the flank @entity112 ( @entity20 ) - @entity18 questions have been asked of the defender 's ability since @entity116 brought him in to help the club 's defensive problems			1
he will face another huge task up against @entity43 on sunday			2
if he is not on top of his game , it could be an embarrassing afternoon			0
@entity112 ( left ) has started the last two games at centre back for @entity18 @entity126 ( @entity21 ) - @entity18 the @entity21 has been preferred at right back since @entity127 switched to playing four at the back instead of three with two wing backs			1
at times , he can be a real aid to @entity18 's attack , picking out team - mates with crosses			0
but by equal measure , he can be a liability , too			0
which @entity126 will turn up ? @entity21 defender @entity126 , challenging @entity137 , has been the first choice right back for @entity116 @entity139 ( @entity21 ) - @entity19 unlikely that he will start at the same time as @entity87 , but if he plays , @entity139 will be required to put in the same hard graft as his international counterpart			1
yet to prove his worth since moving from @entity143 in the summer			0
@entity19 's @entity139 , in action at @entity145 , is unlikely to start on sunday alongside @entity87 @entity146 ( @entity20 ) - @entity19 @entity146 appears to be getting edged out of the team by summer signing @entity148 but the new man 's inconsistent displays for @entity19 mean the @entity151 could be due to start at centre back in such an important match			1
often the target for flak , @entity146 was an asset for @entity19 in their title - winning campaign last season and could yet frustrate @entity18			1
@entity146 could come into the @entity19 starting @entity160 to replace @entity148 @entity161 ( @entity20 ) - @entity19 extremely unlikely he will play and is instead expected to watch from the bench			1
the goalkeeper has only been preferred once to @entity164 in the league , against @entity166 , and has conceded seven goals in his four appearances in all competitions			0
goalkeeper @entity161 played for @entity19 during their home @entity172 defeat by @entity173 @entity174 ( @entity175 ) - @entity18 @entity176 is recovering from a hamstring injury which ruled him out of their 1 - 1 draw with @entity181			1
but he has been back in training with @entity18 and @entity127 often called on him at the start of the season			2
this game will perhaps come too early for a starting place			0
@entity176 missed last week 's game with @entity181 due to a hamstring injury - but could be fit for sunday			0

@entity59 , @entity126 and @entity112 should start for @entity18 at the @entity191 on sunday
@entity73 and @entity174 are also in contention
@entity43 , @entity102 , @entity146 and @entity139 all likely starters for @entity19
current record of @entity2 starting a @entity29 match is seven
