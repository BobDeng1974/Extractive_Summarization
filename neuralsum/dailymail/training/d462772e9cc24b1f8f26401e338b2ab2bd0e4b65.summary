there has been a huge wave of positivity and excitement around @entity3 , after the appointment of @entity8 as our new head coach was confirmed			1
memories of last season ’s swashbuckling , confident @entity26 team live strong in the memory of most @entity3 fans , who seem excited to see what @entity8 can do with a squad full of players with more quality than was available at @entity33			1
new man in charge : @entity8 has been named as the new manager of @entity3 whilst @entity38 boss @entity37 was the man that most @entity3 fans wanted to see take the club forward , the excitement about @entity8 speaks volumes of how well he is thought of by @entity3 fans			1
i always felt that @entity8 was a much better fit to what @entity46 wants to achieve at @entity6 than @entity48 , so i am pleased that we have gone with the @entity50			0
@entity8 ’s high - tempo , attacking philosophy can , i believe , be easily translated to our squad , and @entity8 has managed in @entity54 long enough to have tailored his preferred set - up to suit the physical demands of the @entity57			2
on the attack : @entity59 can provide @entity3 with an outlet for getting forward the @entity8 way : @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 play the way the new boss likes benefit : @entity67 could thrive under @entity8 's guidance players like @entity64 , @entity62 and @entity63 have both the ability and work - rate to press the opposition how @entity8 likes , and in @entity74 , @entity59 and @entity67 , i really feel we have a young , creative set of attacking midfielders who could all benefit from playing in @entity8 ’s exciting system			1
whilst i am very happy to see the back of @entity82 , the work that @entity82 did to promote players from the academy was refreshing			0
i am hopeful that @entity8 will continue this policy at @entity6 , and there is no reason why he should n’t			0
young hope : @entity3 fans would like to see players like @entity92 given a chance time to go : @entity3 fans were glad to see the back of @entity82 as manager the likes of @entity92 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 are all exciting young players , and players who will be looking to get a chance under the new manager			2
i ’m excited ; the fans needed a change of atmosphere after the diabolic season we have just had to endure , and a manager like @entity8 is just what we needed			2
if @entity46 gives pochettino time , i am confident @entity3 will progress under his leadership			0
