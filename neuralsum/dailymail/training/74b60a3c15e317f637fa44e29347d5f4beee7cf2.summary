by @entity0 published : 07:54 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 07:57 est , 27 january 2014 @entity4 's @entity3 rover is experiencing mechanical problems and may not be able to finish its mission			1
the six - wheeled @entity8 vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years			1
it was designed to roam the lunar surface for three months while surveying for natural resources and sending back data , along with its stationary lander , @entity16			2
the soft - landing of the @entity16 lander in december made @entity4 the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the @entity21 and @entity22 the mission has been a popular success for @entity4 's space programme and the rover has attracted more than 150,000 followers on its microblog			1
it last posted on saturday saying repairs were underway and hope was not lost			0
‘ sorry to make you all sad			0
the engineers and i have n't given up yet , ’ the posting said			2
news of the rover 's troubles were splashed across @entity4 newspapers on monday and even featured at the @entity41 's daily briefing			2
the sky over the @entity43 appears inky black in this picture showing the @entity3 rover trundling across the lunar surface taken from the @entity16 lander the potential to extract the moon 's resources has been touted as a key reason behind @entity54 's space programme			1
the moon is believed to hold uranium , titanium , and other mineral resources , as well as offering the possibility of solar power generation			2
' @entity4 wants to go to the moon for geostrategic reasons and domestic legitimacy , ' said @entity4 space expert @entity63 , a professor of national security affairs at the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68			0
' with the @entity21 exploration moribund at best , that opens a window for @entity4 to be perceived as the global technology leader - though the @entity21 still has more , and more advanced , assets in space			2
' the problems appeared to be related to the solar - powered probe 's process for shutting down for the lunar night , which lasts more than two weeks			1
the temperature during that time drops to minus 180 ° @entity80 the probe had survived its first shutdown , during which it is unable to generate energy from its solar panels and relies on a radioactive power source to keep its delicate sensors and other equipment intact			1
the rover was traversing a relatively flat part of the moon known as @entity92 , or the @entity92 , at a speed of 200 yards per hour			0
the landing vehicle , which has already shut down for the lunar night , is designed to conduct scientific examinations for one year			1
online speculation focused on the possibility of lunar dust having blocked one of the solar panels from folding inward , leaving equipment exposed to the dangerously low temperatures			1

the six - wheeled @entity8 vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years it will not be known if the probe is able to function again until after the two - week break			1
@entity4 's space programme has made steady progress since the country launched its first manned spacecraft in 2003			0
it has launched a lunar orbiter , conducted space walks , and put into orbit a prototype space station , to be replaced by a permanent station at the end of the decade			0
already a source of enormous national pride , the programme has increasingly sought to connect with the public through social media and educational outreach			0
@entity4 's second woman in space , @entity138 , conducted @entity4 's first space classroom to students nationwide from the prototype space station , the @entity142			0

@entity149 's process for shutting down for the lunar night has *malfunctioned*
a lunar night lasts two weeks and temperatures can drop to minus 180 ° c
@entity43 dust may have blocked one of the solar panels from folding inward , leaving equipment exposed to the dangerously low temperatures
scientists wo n't know if probe will work until after the two - week period
