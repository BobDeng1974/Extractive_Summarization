@entity1 ’s hopes of @entity2 finally agreeing to meet him in a megabucks fight have been dismissed as an empty dream by @entity6 ’s legendary trainer			1
@entity7 has also poured cold water over speculation that his @entity6 might fight @entity1 , who has nominated @entity6 as his alternative opponent to @entity2			1
@entity1 , the victim of a broken promise by @entity2 once already , has been encouraged to believe that victory over former world champion @entity13 next month will lead to a @entity15 showdown with @entity16 next may			1
’ nor is he speaking out of sour grapes for @entity1 leaving him for another @entity23 trainer after losing the two world titles to which he had been guided by @entity7			1
in fact , @entity7 bases that assessment on his belief that @entity29 ’s favourite son would present problems to the boxer rated the pound - for - pound best in the world			2
@entity7 says : ‘ @entity2 knows that @entity1 ’s speed would trouble him			1
he is too careful with his choice of opponents to take that risk			0
@entity7 has also poured cold water over speculation that @entity6 ( above ) could fight @entity1 ‘ @entity2 also knows he himself does n’t possess the knock - out punch which would make him more certain of winning that fight			1
’ @entity6 , however , does carry concussive one - punch power and @entity7 reveals for the first time that he used it to ko @entity1 several times in sparring when they were training together in his @entity50 gym in @entity51			1
@entity7 says : ‘ @entity6 frequently put @entity1 on the floor , knocking him cold four or five times			1
’ since that was inflicted with gloves more thickly padded than those used in actual fights and @entity6 is as fast as @entity1 , @entity7 says : ‘ there ’s no point @entity6 fighting @entity1			1
the reality is that it ’s no big fight			0
’ @entity1 left @entity7 ( right ) for @entity61 after losing his two world titles @entity6 , always courteous and diplomatic , politely went along with the notion of a @entity65 fight when it was put to him			1
but he made clear later : ‘ i do not choose who i fight			0
that decision is always made by my trainer and promoter			0
’ @entity7 will advise @entity72 promoter @entity71 against taking @entity6 to @entity73 ‘ for a non-fight ’ , even though he expects @entity1 to edge @entity13 in @entity15 on december 7			1
he says : ‘ @entity1 can win this one because although @entity13 has good skills he does n’t have a big punch ’			1
@entity7 shares @entity71 ’s belief that only a phenomenal financial offer will lure @entity2 into boxing any opponent who would seriously imperil his cherished unbeaten record			2
@entity7 says : ‘ @entity6 is the one really big threat			2
that ’s why everyone has been wanting to see them fight for so long			0
and that is why this is the only fight which can raise enough money to get @entity2 into the ring with someone truly dangerous			2
’ @entity6 and @entity90 gear up for battle in @entity92 in front of the glare of the world 's media @entity71 is working towards an offer which no man who calls himself money and is so obsessed with the folding stuff can possibly refuse – namely a minimum £ 95million purse from an unprecedented @entity103			2
that depends on him pioneering pay - per - view television in the gigantic @entity107 market , which in turn relies on both @entity6 and the ring idol of the @entity111 @entity110 winning their fights here this weekend			0
@entity6 ’s catch - weight defence of his world welterweight title against @entity115 ’s undefeated light - welter champion @entity90 marks the second time @entity110 has been the @entity6 ’s chief support in @entity92 ’s @entity117			0
the 35 - year - old @entity118 revealed earlier this week he felt as fit as he did in the early stages of his career @entity110 , a gold medallist at the @entity122 and @entity121 , has his first 12 - round assignment in only his sixth professional fight			0
curiously , it is against an unbeaten @entity127 flyweight who looks so much like @entity6 that his appearance at the final press conference caused much amusement and we dubbed him @entity132			0
@entity110 , whose fights are watched by hundreds of millions on the mainland , is more crucial to the @entity107 pay - tv project – with its potential for generating more than half the billion dollar target – than even @entity6 versus the @entity140 man			0
@entity71 says : ‘ we ’re getting there with this deal			0
’ @entity2 poses with bundles of cash ( right ) - but could be set to earn even more if he fights @entity6 so he is trusting that @entity132 only resembles @entity6 in appearance , not explosive boxing ability			1
assuming all goes according to plan , @entity71 will then concentrate on the power of money			0
of @entity2 ’s luxury spending on an industrial scale – designer watches , diamond jewellery , luxury cars , nightclub ladies and now a gold - plated @entity158 golf cart for his son ’s birthday – @entity7 says : ‘ we are watching the way he gets through his money and at the present rate he ’s going to need a lot more			2
we hope that ’s going to be our trump card in getting @entity6 the fight. , ’ so does the boxing world			0
@entity171 will be televised live in @entity172 on @entity173 late saturday night .			0

@entity1 's hopes of fighting @entity2 have been dismissed by the @entity29 man 's former trainer @entity7
