by @entity0 it is always good form to wear a sunhat at the beach - but at one sandy spot today hard hats were more in order			2
in @entity10 , @entity11 , today hundreds of tons of gravel were sprayed from just off - shore by a giant dredger drafted in to repair the devastation caused by the huge storms this winter			1
miles and miles of @entity18 coast was battered by high winds and powerful waves , which has sped up the rate at which the beach is dwindling			0
the process of longshore drift - where natural tides gradually shift sand and sediment along the shoreline - was put into overdrive by the unnaturally fierce weather			0
in an attempt to restore the shrinking sands , the @entity30 and local councils have begun using the dredging vessels - such as the @entity35 pictured below - to suck up sediment from one point along the beach , mix it with water and spit it back out			1
the process , known as rainbowing , should help protect the beach in years to come			0

huge dredger was seen spraying mixture of sediment and water onto the beach at @entity10 , @entity11
