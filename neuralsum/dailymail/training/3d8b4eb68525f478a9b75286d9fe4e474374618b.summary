by @entity0 published : 05:17 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 10:14 est , 12 june 2013 town hall chiefs are spending £ 150,000 on accurately measuring the amount of grass , shrubs and hedges that need cutting in all of their borough 's green spaces , it was revealed today			0
@entity9 in @entity10 said it needs the nine - month exercise ahead of a re-tendering next year - with @entity12 , which has cut the grass since 2010 , coming to the end of its contract			1
land surveying firm @entity17 , based in @entity18 , @entity19 , has now been hired to measure the borough ’s greenery so the council can specify how much grass must be mowed			1
landscaping : @entity9 in @entity10 said it needs the nine - month exercise ahead of a re-tendering next year - with @entity12 , which has cut the grass since 2010 , coming to the end of its contract @entity26 , leader of @entity28 ’s opposition @entity27 , which opposed the council privatising the service in 2010 , said the expenditure ‘ does sound like a bit of a shambles ’			1
he added : ‘ we opposed the privatisation of the contract in the first place , and i think we have been proved right			2
it would have been so much better if it was council staff carrying out these jobs			1
‘ one hundred and fifty thousand pounds is a load of money to be paying out on top of a contract to another company afterwards and you need to wonder about the competency of the council			1
’ the council said it must make sure that cutting contracts offered to companies are accurate			2
this means that £ 150,000 must be spent before a new grass cutting company can even be employed			0
the re-measuring exercise will take nine months to complete , and also includes an assessment of what obstacles - such as bollards and pylons - could hinder the new grass cutting efforts			2
the last re-measuring took place in 2008 at a third of the cost - £ 45,000 - but @entity63 councillor @entity62 said that this was a poor job that led to issues with the @entity12 contract			1
@entity62 , councillor for leisure and arts , said : ‘ it ’s a lot of money , i make no bones about that , but we ’re talking about a huge project here			2
' it will go into the fine details rather than a finger in the air job			0
i do n’t want to spend £ 50,000 and then run into problems later down the line			0
what you pay for is what you get			0
’ eager gardener : the exercise is reminiscent of mr @entity88 from the @entity91 children 's book series , who always insisted on ensuring every blade of his grass was straight and that his flowers all grew in a straight line the council added that @entity17 has the specialist equipment required to carry out the project , and it is a sophisticated process with the data being recorded and stored electronically			1
the council served 61 rectification notices and 40 default notices to @entity12 in a six - month period shortly after the grass - cutting was privatised			1
@entity107 campaign manager @entity106 said : ‘ local residents will be absolutely aghast at the amount of money @entity9 is paying these expensive contractors for this ludicrous project			1
‘ taxpayers want to know that their council is spending their hard - earned cash on frontline and essential services , not on bizarre exercises like this			0
@entity9 needs to rethink its spending priorities at once , put local residents first and deliver far better value for money for local residents			2
’ ' it does sound like a bit of a shambles ' @entity26 , @entity28 's @entity27 leader the exercise is reminiscent of the green - fingered mr @entity88 character from the @entity91 children 's book series , who always insisted on ensuring every blade of his grass was straight and that his flowers all grew in a straight line			0
but a @entity9 spokesman told @entity137 : ‘ this is a major and vital piece of work that has to be done in preparation for the next tender exercise in 2014 which will be for a contract that has a value of up to £ 1.5million per year			1
' we have to recount obstacles and re-measure shrubs and hedges across the entire borough which is 42.5 sq miles			0
' this is to make sure the information we have is up to date and will ensure that we get value for money from the next contract that we award , which is worth millions of pounds			0
' the last re-measuring exercise took place in 2008 and cost around £ 45,000			0
however , the new re-measuring exercise is more expensive because it will be a much more sophisticated process , with information being recorded electronically			0

contract with @entity12 since 2010 is soon coming to an end
