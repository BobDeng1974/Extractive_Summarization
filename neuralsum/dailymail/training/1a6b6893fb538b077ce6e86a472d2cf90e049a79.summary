by @entity1 reporter published : 14:01 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 16:25 est , 11 march 2014 a divorce lawyer from @entity4 has been accused of bilking one of her clients out of more than $ 100,000 and is now facing felony theft charges			1
@entity9 prosecutors claim @entity10 made off with money that was awarded to her bus driver client , as part of a settlement			1
according to court papers , mrs @entity10 , 41 , raided a trust account that held the man 's money and used it to pay personal expenses			1
@entity10 , 41 : she is a divorce attorney accused of making off with more than $ 100,000 owed to one of her clients			1
@entity10 now faces felony theft charges after raiding the account where the cash was being held after being hired by @entity10 , the man was awarded $ 117,000 as part of the settlement			1
however , instead of receiving the money directly , though , the settlement payment ended up in a trust account held by @entity10			1
although @entity10 's bill for representing the man was less than $ 10,000 , she cleaned out the entire account			1
according to @entity34 , she is alleged to have done so without ever acknowledging the settlement had been paid			2
@entity36 : after @entity38 's client sued her and and won a $ 162,000 judgment , only a small amount of that debt has been paid with the court seizing her husbands ( pictured ) pay as part of the settlement her client ultimately sued @entity10 and won a $ 162,000 judgment but only a small amount of that debt has been paid with the court seizing her husbands pay as part of the settlement			1
@entity10 has been charged with first - degree theft			1
if the charges are proven , it would appear the attorney who has been practicing for 16 years took advantage of her client when they were at their most vulnerable			1
@entity10 even purports to be a great navigator during times of crisis on her website			1
' i have a great deal of skill helping to guide my clients through these confusing and overwhelming times with knowledgeable advice and representation , coupled with respect , understanding , and compassion			2
the legal process can sometimes be cold , confusing , and overwhelming , especially if you are already dealing with an emotional family situation			2
unlike a contract or business dispute , in family law , you are laying the most important and valuable people and things in your life before the court			2
' @entity10 's license is now suspended pending the outcome of the charged			1
many of her former clients would find the details of the current court beg to differ with the treatment they 've received according to some of her online reviews			2
' i do not recommend @entity90 , ' one client wrote who was having a will prepared			2
' it was incompetently done according to another attorney with mis - spelled names , lack of page numbers and most of all , did n't really qualify as a legal will since it was so incomplete			0
avoid this attorney - it was a humiliating and frustrating experience			0
' another client who used her to facilitate their divorce is even more damning in their judgement saying that calls at emails were not returned			2
' i feel that this attorney had only her own interests at heart			0
she gave every excuse for this from blaming her assistant to technology , just to name a few			0
she was home sick , on vacation or just plain gone more than not			0
when questioned why commitments made were not met , her responses were frequently quite defensive			0
paperwork , spreadsheets and letters took forever to get composed and many times were full of errors found by the opposing side , requiring much rework			0
she spent a lot of time fighting over small stuff that cost more in billing hours than the items were actually worth			0
the case was dragged out way longer than was necessary			0
' a final review has echoes of the current court case			0
' we feel very mislead with this attorney			0
our retainer was paid almost 4 months ago and after many promises , we feel we have been mislead			0
there still have been no papers filed or completed , we do not get timely ( if any ) return phone calls , we consistently have to call the office and leave messages without a response			0
