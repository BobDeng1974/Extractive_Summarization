by @entity0 walking just a quarter of a mile a day could save ageing adults from potential disabilities in old age a 20 - minute walk in the park every day could keep older people active and stave off disability , say researchers			1
the first study of its kind shows daily walking for about a quarter of a mile may mean the difference between staying mobile or becoming housebound			1
it found moderate physical activity helped ageing adults keep their ability to walk at a rate 18 per cent higher than older adults who did not exercise			1
the @entity22 - based life study from @entity23 , coordinated at the @entity24 , also showed regular walkers were a quarter less likely to become permanently disabled			1
researchers presented the results yesterday at the annual meeting of the @entity29 in @entity30 and it was published in the @entity32			2
they recruited 1,635 sedentary men and women ages 70 to 89 for the study			0
the volunteers could walk a quarter mile within 15 minutes but were at risk of losing that ability			1
the participants were randomly separated into two groups and followed for more than two years			0
the first group walked 150 minutes per week and did strength , flexibility and balance training , and were regularly monitored			0
the second group attended health education classes and performed stretching exercises			0
staff assessed participants every six months , checking their ability to walk , their body weight , blood pressure and pulse rate , among other measurements			1
they were not told who was assigned to physical activity or to the education classes			0
researchers showed that prescribed daily physical activity can prevent older adults ’ loss of mobility , defined in the study as the ability to walk 400 meters , or about a quarter of a mile			1
co-principal investigator @entity67 , professor of epidemiology and public health at the @entity70 , said the distance was an important figure for older adults			2
he said : ‘ four hundred metres is once around the track , or from the parking lot to the store , or two or three blocks around your neighbourhood			0
‘ it ’s an important distance in maintaining an independent life			0
’ the study by @entity23 found a daily walk could prevent people from being housebound @entity86 activity helped volunteers maintain their ability to walk at a rate 18 per cent higher than older adults who did not exercise and there was a 28 per cent reduction in people permanently losing the ability to walk easily			1
prof @entity67 said ‘ the fact that we had an even bigger impact on persistent disability is very good			0
‘ it implies that a greater percentage of the adults who had physical activity intervention recovered when they did develop mobility disability			2
’ @entity102 , professor of medicine in the division of geriatric medicine at the @entity106 , who helped review the scientific merit of the study , said ‘ there is a general belief among the public and the scientific and medical communities that we know exercise is good for you , so why do we need to do more research in this area ? ‘ however , we still do not know whether certain types or doses of exercise are better than others , particularly for specific health conditions or diseases			0
‘ @entity125 trial demonstrated that a modest increase in physical activity has the potential to help older adults maintain functional independence			2

@entity23 found walkers quarter less likely to be disabled
@entity134 walking of quarter of a mile kept ageing adults ability to move
researchers *encourage* people to walk to the shops or around the park
