by @entity0 @entity1 have abandoned plans to sell red grouse meat in many of their stores following a row over how the birds are hunted			1
the high street chain had planned to sell the game in shops around the country after it was successfully trialled in two stores in west @entity14			1
but the company have postponed the plans after ornithologists threatened to boycott the store over fears rare birds of prey were being killed to protect the grouse ahead of hunting			1
plans to sell red grouse meat in @entity1 have been postponed due to the fears of conservationists the chain is bringing in a code of conduct for suppliers before selling the game in a bid to allay concerns @entity1 became the first retailer to stock whole wild red grouse when it announced the game would go on sale for Â£ 10 in its flagship @entity38 and @entity39 stores last august			1
at the time , @entity1 's @entity40 said : ' our customers are telling us they are keen to try more game as an alternative to traditional everyday meats			2
' the birds , which have a distinctive rich flavour , were shot on the moors in @entity49 and @entity50 and transported to stores in time for the following morning			0
but the move has since been criticised by conservationists , who fear rare birds of prey like the hen harrier were being killed to protect birds for shooting			2
former @entity59 conservation director @entity58 has written to the company urging it to stop selling the meat			0
the @entity59 has said it believes hen harriers are being killed or driven off moorland by game keepers mr @entity58 wrote on his blog : ' the rare and threatened hen harrier hardly exists on @entity69 grouse moors these days because of illegal persecution by game - shooting interests			0
other protected wildlife is also killed by grouse shooting interests			0
' the @entity74 reported today that @entity1 has now decided not to sell the meat until a code of conduct can be enforced with all of its suppliers			1
the store 's @entity80 told the paper 15 estates in @entity49 and the @entity85 borders had agreed to comply with the new code and would supply the game once it had been independently verified that they are sticking to the rules			0
the decision was welcomed by the @entity59 , who likened it to the responsible sourcing of many other products the stores sell .			0

meat was planned for stores after customers in @entity14 snapped it up
but plans *angered* conservationists , who said hunting hit birds of prey
@entity1 have now agreed to wait until strict rules for suppliers can be enforced
