@entity1 pursuit of @entity3 centre - back @entity2 looks to have been successful after @entity5 coach @entity4 admitted he was resigned to losing his captain on friday			1
the 27 - year - old has a 10m euro buy - out clause in his contract and so @entity11 holders @entity5 are powerless to stop his departure			1
@entity4 said before the season kicks - off against @entity14 on saturday : “ there is no chance that he will be playing for us this weekend			0
i ’m happy for him			0
we want him to stay but this is what happens when you win things			0
” @entity1 coach @entity38 knows @entity2 from his time coach @entity40 side @entity40			1
the former under - 20 @entity3 international can play in holding midfield but it ’s in the centre of defence that he makes best use of his impressive 6ft 4ins frame and where he helped @entity5 to @entity49 glory last season			2
@entity5 signed @entity2 as a 19 - year - old in 2007 from @entity52 and his imposing physique but elegance on the ball drew comparisons with @entity57 at @entity58			1
injuries have not been kind to him since then and his career stagnated before @entity4 arrived at @entity5			2
experienced : @entity2 stands at 6ft 5ins tall and he has made 179 appearances for @entity63 side @entity5 international : the 27 - year - old @entity2 has played for @entity64 , representing his nation on two occasions this summer there were even questions asked of @entity58 by their supporters as to why they never looked at a player who would have cost them half as much as @entity72			1
he felt his form last season should have earned him a call - up to the national team and a place in the @entity79 @entity78			0
@entity80 was not a fan but new @entity64 coach @entity82 is , and the move to the @entity84 could now be his springboard to international football			0
@entity87 is to always believe - @entity38			0

@entity1 meet @entity5 defender *'s* £ 8m buy - out clause
spurs could *complete* the deal in next *24* hours
the 27 - year - old @entity2 has two @entity64 caps and is 6ft 5ins tall
he has made 179 appearances for @entity5 but is open to moving to @entity1
@entity4 accepts he has lost his captain to @entity1
