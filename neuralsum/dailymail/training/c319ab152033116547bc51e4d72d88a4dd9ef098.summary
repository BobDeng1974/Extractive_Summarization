@entity3 said she wanted to be ' nice ' to teachers to get the best out of them			2
her remarks are in stark contrast to her predecessor mr @entity15 who infuriated teachers and unions by attacking the education establishment as a block on change			1
allies of the former education secretary claim his demotion in last week 's reshuffle signalled that the @entity34 had lost its war against the teaching unions - which they refer to as ' the blob '			1

' if grammar schools want to expand , we ’re not going to stand in their way			0

' she rejected calls to perform a u-turn on rules to punish parents who take their children out of class during term time , saying the policy ' sends a firm signal '			1
mrs @entity13 also backed the policy of allowing lessons to be taught by people without formal teaching qualifications : ' if ( heads ) say that the best person to teach economics is somebody who has worked in a bank in the @entity116 , then fine			2
' @entity15 was hated by many teachers over his radical reforms to school pay , the curriculum and exam standards the education secretary also supported mr @entity15 's policy of allowing new free schools to be opened where there is demand , even if there is no shortage of school places in the area			1
' if there is parental demand for free schools , that 's where they should go , ' she said			0
