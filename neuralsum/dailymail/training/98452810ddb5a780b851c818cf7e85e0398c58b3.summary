by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 10:56 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 19:06 est , 10 january 2013 @entity3 tore into @entity5 's pledge to protect pensioner benefits for millionaires as neither ' explicable or justifiable ' @entity3 yesterday tore into @entity5 ’s ‘ completely irrational ’ decision to protect benefits for wealthy pensioners while imposing cuts on the rest of society			1
the @entity15 leader launched an extraordinary attack on the pledge made by his coalition partner that free bus passes , tv licences and winter fuel allowances would continue for all pensioners , including wealthy over- 65s like @entity23 and @entity24			1
mr @entity3 said he would be ‘ gobsmacked ’ if mr @entity5 repeated the promise in the @entity27 manifesto in 2015 , which he predicted would be the ‘ first full - blown scarcity election ’			1
ahead of the last election mr @entity5 told voters they could ‘ read my lips ’ as he vowed not all pensioner benefits would continue			2
but yesterday mr @entity3 said it was not fair on public sector workers or people on working age benefits who have been hit with real terms cuts to continue to fund giveaways for millionaires			1
mr @entity5 is coming under growing pressure from senior ministers to drop the pledge or risk appearing to be shelter traditionally @entity27 voters from cuts			2
in a contemptuous swipe at the @entity49 , mr @entity3 said : ‘ when you are having to make … unprecedented savings , the idea that you exempt millionaire and multimillionaire pensioners uniquely from further savings is completely irrational			1
‘ i would be gobsmacked in that context if any sensible , responsible political party will somehow think its explicable or justifiable that millionaire or multimillionaire pensioners are not going to be affected at all			2
’ mr @entity3 said it was ' irrational ' to protect benefits for millionaire pensioners like @entity23 and @entity24 while capping public sector pay and tax credits mr @entity3 claimed even most wealthy pensioners did not think they should be exempt from austerity			1
. @entity3 struck a blow for the cool reputation of onesies when he became the most high profile politician to date who owns an all - in - one			1
in the final question on his new @entity76 phone - in , mr @entity3 disclosed that he owned a ' big green ' onesie - but he had never worn it			1
' i was given a big green onesie which i have kept in its packaging			2
i have got one but i have n't worn it yet			0
it will be something i do in the privacy of my own home , ' he added			0
he later joked he was a ' @entity86 politician '			0
the prime minister 's spokesman declined to say whether @entity5 owned a onesie			0
‘ let me make a prediction			0
any political party who goes into the next general committing to not touch a single hair on the head of benefits for the most affluent pensions in this country will be found out very quickly , ’ he told journalists at a parliamentary lunch			0
‘ you can not ask people to take big cuts in their housing benefit , in their other benefits and say it ’s ok for @entity23 and @entity24 to be given a whole bunch of free benefits when they do n’t need it , paid for by other taxpayers			0
’ however , mr @entity3 insisted he did not back a call from former @entity15 minister @entity113 that the winter fuel allowance , worth up to £ 300 to over- 80s , be limited to just the 2million poorest pensioners			1
‘ the question is where do you have the cut off			0
we have n’t decided as a party , ’ he added			0
mr @entity3 predicted that parties would offer two - tier manifesto commitments for 2015 , to prepare for another coalition government			1
he said they would have to establish which policies they would ‘ die in a ditch ’ for , and which ones were negotiable			0
of his party ’s infamous u-turn on raising university tuition fees , he said : ‘ we ’re not going to make that mistake again			0
’ mr @entity3 said there was a ‘ principled case ’ that when doctors , teachers and nurses have had payrises capped at one per cent and benefits are capped at one per cent , it was wrong to say : ‘ oh and by the way @entity24 you carry on – whether he receives it or not - carry on with your tax - subsidised entitlement to winter fuel payments , tv licences … what a difference : it was all smiles on monday when @entity3 , left , and @entity5 presented their @entity153 ‘ the next general election in my view is going to be the first full - blown scarcity election			1
’ @entity158 should return to the @entity159 if he is cleared of making his ex-wife take his speeding points , @entity3 said yesterday			1
asked if he hoped the former energy secretary , pictured , would return to front - line politics , the @entity15 leader said : ‘ i would like to see @entity158 if he is cleared of everything			1
he ’s an old colleague and a friend of mine and i want to see him at the top table of @entity169 politics			0
’ mr @entity158 is facing criminal charges for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over claims that he persuaded @entity175 to take his penalty points for a speeding offence in 2003			0
he also backed another round of leadership debates featuring himself , mr @entity5 and @entity181 leader @entity180 – but resisted calls for @entity169 @entity184 leader @entity183 to be included , even though @entity184 ’s poll ratings are now nearly double those of the @entity15			1
‘ the format we had before [ at the last general election ] was a good one , ’ he said			2
yesterday @entity190 became the latest senior conservative minister to signal that the @entity27 pledge to protect universal benefits must be ditched in the next election manifesto			2
‘ before the election the @entity181 started putting out leaflets accusing us of planning to take away benefits from pensioners , ' he said			2
‘ very rapidly a promise was given that we would n’t reduce benefits to pensioners , ’ he told @entity200			0
' we actually tied ourselves down for this parliament not addressing them			0
' they , i ’m sure , when we get round , which we have n’t yet , contemplating our manifesto for the next election they ’ll be an agenda item			2
