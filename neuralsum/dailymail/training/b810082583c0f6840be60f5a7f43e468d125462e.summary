since this time , the circumstances of my case have become dire and the time for action on the part of the @entity1 government is now			1
' he added : ' as each day passes and circumstances continue to deteriorate i am pleading for your assistance to intervene and act on my behalf			0
i have been wrongly accused , taken away from my family and denied my human rights			2
my resolve is beginning to wane and my hope diminishing			0
i reach out to you in desperation as only government intervention will save me from a fate which i do not deserve			2
' mr @entity7 was taken to the prosecutor 's office in southern @entity18 this morning as police handed over a dossier naming him as a suspect			1
his family insist he is innocent and have called on @entity1 authorities to lobby on his behalf			1
according to his brother , @entity54 , the @entity3 @entity55 has said mr @entity7 's case has been sent forward for trial			1
he told @entity59 in @entity1 his brother will probably be moved to the @entity60 for the pre-trial period which may last a further four months			1
mr @entity7 's family claim the 45 - year - old teacher is innocent and called on @entity1 authorities to help mr @entity7 was arrested alongside @entity3 teaching assistant @entity64 , who is also being held without charge			1
the pair were arrested after an earlier allegation of abuse against cleaners who worked at the school following the arrests of mr @entity7 and mr @entity64 , the school issued a statement supporting the two men			1
according to the statement : ' we are distressed by this turn of events and are very frustrated that our staff members have been detained based on allegations against them that are absolutely false and are made without evidence			2
we will continue to stand by these staff members , both of whom have exemplary professional records			0
we appeal to the @entity3 police to reconsider their decision to detain both men			2
' i am writing as a follow up to a letter i sent to you august 14th			0
since this time , the circumstances of my case have become dire and the time for action on the part of the @entity1 government is now			1
the office of the attorney general announced wednesday , october 29th that they would be accepting my case for trial after rejecting the file on three previous occasions			0
no further ' evidence ' had been collected and additional requirements never completed , yet the file has been accepted			0
these developments are highly suspect and cause concerns about corruption and collusion between the prosecutors office and the police to move this case forward abandoning all considerations of proper legal protocol and procedures			1
it is my understanding that there is a legal precedence whereby the attorney general 's office can still review the file and make a decision to refrain from proceeding to trial			0
i am asking the @entity125 to use all its power to take immediate diplomatic action at the highest levels , where political influence is expected to have its greatest effect , to ensure the case does not move forward to trial			0
this is a critical time as a new government has been sworn in and a new attorney general is to be appointed within days			2
the selection of this attorney general is charged with the responsibility of eradicating corruption and eliminating injustice			0
i have been informed that the founding embassies of @entity8 , the @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 , are planning to meet the new attorney general within days of his / her appointment to lobby for the case to be thrown out			2
i expect the @entity1 @entity144 will be present as well			2
in addition to this lobbying , i am requesting that @entity151 reach out to this newly appointed government at the highest levels to make your concerns known			0
although i am relieved to know that status of the @entity157 female individual ( jis elementary principal ) remains that of a witness , it is difficult to accept that she has avoided being named a suspect			0
it is apparent that she has been afforded greater protection as an @entity157 citizen and i feel it is unacceptable that @entity1 has not made a greater effort to protect and stand up for an innocent @entity1 citizen			1
as each day passes and circumstances continue to deteriorate i am pleading for your assistance to intervene and act on my behalf			0
i have been wrongly accused , taken away from my family and denied my human rights			0
my resolve is beginning to wane and my hope diminishing			0
i reach out to you in desperation as only government intervention will save me from a fate which i do not deserve			0
