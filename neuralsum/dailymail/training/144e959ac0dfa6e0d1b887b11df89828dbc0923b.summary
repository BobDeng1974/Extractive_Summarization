@entity0 says antibacterial soaps could be at best , ineffective and at worst , a threat to public health the @entity0 said today there is no evidence that antibacterial chemicals used in liquid soaps and washes help prevent the spread of germs , and there is some evidence they may pose health risks			1
the agency said it is revisiting the safety of chemicals like triclosan in light of recent studies suggesting they can interfere with hormone levels and spur the growth of drug - resistant bacteria			1
the government 's preliminary ruling lends new credence to longstanding warnings from researchers who say the chemicals are , at best , ineffective and at worst , a threat to public health			2
under its proposed rule released monday , the agency will require manufacturers to prove that their antibacterial soaps and body washes are safe and more effective than plain soap and water			1
manufacturers will have a year to prove it after the @entity0 said : ' to put it simply , we need to collect additional information from the companies that make these products so that consumers can be confident about their effectiveness and about their safety			0
' if companies can not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their products , they would have to be reformulated , relabeled or possibly removed from the market			0
the agency will take comments on its proposal before finalizing it in coming months			0
' due to consumers ' extensive exposure to the ingredients in antibacterial soaps , we believe there should be a clearly demonstrated benefit from using antibacterial soap to balance any potential risk , ' said dr. @entity67 , director of the @entity0 's drug center			2
' the proposed rule covers only those antibacterial soaps and washes that are used with water			2
it does not apply to hand sanitizers , hand wipes or antibacterial soaps that are used in health care setting such as hospitals ' , the @entity0 said in their blog			1
they aim to have their final rule by september 2016			0
the agency 's proposal comes more than 40 years after the agency was first tasked with evaluating triclosan and similar ingredients			0
at least 2,000 different soap products contain triclosan or some other antimicrobial agent and it is also used in toothpaste to kill germs that cause gum disease , the @entity0 's dr. @entity86 said			2
@entity0 first tasked started evaluating triclosan 40 years ago - which is an ingredient in antibacterial soaps ultimately , the government agreed to publish its findings only after a three - year legal battle with the environmental group , @entity98 , which accused the @entity0 of delaying action on triclosan			1
the chemical is found in an estimated 75 percent of antibacterial liquid soaps and body washes sold in the @entity104 the @entity0 's preliminary rule only applies to personal hygiene products , but it has implications for a $ 1 billion industry that includes thousands of antibacterial products , including kitchen knives , toys , pacifiers and toothpaste			1
most of the research surrounding triclosan 's safety involves animal studies , which can not always be applied to humans			0
but some scientists worry the chemical can disrupt hormones in humans too , raising the risk of infertility , early puberty and other developmental problems			0
other experts are concerned that routine use of antibacterial chemicals like triclosan is contributing to a surge in drug - resistant germs , or superbugs , that render antibiotics ineffective			1
in march 2010 , the @entity136 banned the chemical from all products that come into contact with food , such as containers and silverware .			0

chemicals are , at best , ineffective , and at worst , a threat to public heath
chemicals like triclosan could interfere with hormone levels and spur the growth of drug - resistant bacteria
@entity0 is looking at only antibacterial soaps and body washes used with water - not hand sanitizers and hand wipes
