why does the top of a newborn baby ’s head smell so good ? can you train your baby to have healthy eating habits while still in the womb ? and why do babies insist on mastering ' @entity8 ' before ' mama ' ? these were some of the questions that intrigued science journalist @entity10 when she became pregnant for the first time			1
she set out on a quest for definitive answers , which developed into an 18 - month investigation into the science of pregnancy , birth and newborn babies			1
the result was her book @entity22 , a compendium of all things baby and bump - related ... @entity22 : all your pregnancy questions answered - and yes , that includes why newborns smell nice ! why do newborn babies smell so good ? there ’s something intoxicating about the milky smell of a newborn			1
many mothers admit to spending hours inhaling their baby ’s odour			2
and for good reason — several studies have shown that women can pick out the scent of their baby from other newborns just a few days after giving birth			2
parents may also be able to detect a similarity between their baby ’s smell and that of other close family members			2
we do n’t know precisely where these olfactory signals come from , but scientists think it may be the baby ’s sebaceous glands — the tiny oil producers which tend to be particularly active in newborn babies , especially on the head and face			1
body odour is influenced by what we eat , so breast - feeding may also contribute to that delicious new - baby smell			1
@entity65 taste your spicy takeaway ? many women believe eating curry in late pregnancy will bring on labour			2
the taste buds on a baby ’s tongue begin to develop 13 to 15 weeks into pregnancy , enabling him or her to detect simple tastes such as sweet , sour and salty in the womb			2
smells and flavours from a mother ’s food get into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby during the third trimester , and as a foetus breathes and swallows around a litre of this a day , which then passes over smell and taste receptors in the nose and mouth , unborn babies do get a taste of what their mum is eating			1
spicy : can unborn babies really taste strong flavours like these ? according to @entity99 , they certainly can @entity100 to have healthy eating habits in later life ? it seems that the memory of tastes experienced in the womb influences the foods babies like in later life			1
studies have shown that if @entity114 drinks a glass of carrot juice four times a week in the last trimester ( or the first two months of breastfeeding ) her baby will find cereal prepared with carrot juice appealing once weaned			2
babies whose mothers eat a lot of fruit during pregnancy are also more likely to enjoy fruit during weaning			1
trying to eat as many different flavours as possible should , therefore , expose your unborn or breastfeeding baby to different tastes and , in theory make them less prone to fussy eating			2
@entity137 in the womb ? how a mother feels during pregnancy can certainly affect her unborn baby ’s movements			1
in a study at @entity147 ’s @entity146 , ten women in their last trimester were shown an uplifting clip from the film @entity149 — in which @entity150 skips gaily through alpine meadows — while their baby ’s movements were monitored by ultrasound			0
the women also watched a tear ‑ jerking clip from boxing film @entity158			0
they wore earphones , so the baby could n’t hear the soundtrack			0
when the women watched the ' happy ' film , their babies seemed stimulated and waved their arms			1
but during the sad film their movements decreased			0
although the study included only a small number of women , it does at least hint that a baby can detect its mother ’s mood			1
it ’s thought this might occur because hormones , such as adrenaline , are released during times of stress or sadness and can redirect blood flow away from the uterus , which the baby picks up on			0
@entity187 factor : happy films such as @entity149 encourage babies to move around more blue for babies : all babies have them to start with but eye colour changes at 10 months why do newborns have blue eyes ? eye colour is inherited , determined by the amount of a pigment called melanin that we produce			1
people who do n’t produce much melanin have blue or grey eyes , while those who produce lots have brown eyes			0
at birth , however , very little melanin is produced — regardless of genes			0
this is why most babies ’ eyes appear blue or blue - grey			1
but as babies ’ eyes are exposed to the light , the body ’s production of melanin is ramped up			1
if a baby is genetically programmed to produce lots of melanin , their eye colour will begin to change as the months go by			0
a baby ’s eye colour will usually settle down around the age of six months and is unlikely to change much after this			0
are summer - born babies different from winter babies ? if a baby is born in the @entity233 between september and december , they are statistically twice as likely to become a professional football player as a baby born in the summer months			1
unfortunately they are also slightly more likely to suffer from panic attacks and , if male , to become an alcoholic in adulthood			0
meanwhile , if you ’re ambitious for your child to become a doctor , you might aim for an april - june birthday			1
the effect of our birth month on our health is small , but significant enough that it ca n’t be dismissed			0
for example , babies born in the northern hemisphere in february , march and april are 5 - 10 per cent more likely to develop schizophrenia ( one of the best - studied season - linked disorders )			1
different factors are likely to be at work here			0
some studies have suggested that the increased risk of schizophrenia among babies born in the springtime is the result of their mother being exposed to viruses such as influenza during a critical period of pregnancy			1
more recently , scientists have proposed that vitamin d deficiency caused by low levels of sunlight during an autumn / winter pregnancy may be to blame , or that varying levels of brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine at different times of the year may play a role			0
looks matter : babies fixate on faces that are attractive : @entity283 and @entity284 are sure to be popular do babies like some people better than others ? some people love babies , others ca n’t stand them — and little ones feel the same about us			1
given a choice between photographs of two faces — one that had been rated as attractive by a group of adults and one rated unattractive — a newborn baby will choose to fixate on the more appealing face			0
but babies do n’t just judge books by their covers			1
newborns get upset if people ’s facial expressions suggest they ’re not responding to them			0
experiments with babies as young as three hours old have shown that if their mother pulls a blank , expressionless face , the baby responds by decreasing their eye contact and showing signs of distress			1
this suggests that babies are born with certain expectations regarding the rules of communication — much like the rest of us			2
@entity322 ' ? learning to speak requires the coordination of more than 70 different muscles and body parts , so it ’s not until around seven or eight months of age that babies start to babble			2
@entity330 , of the @entity331 , travels the world trying to capture these first utterances and make sense of them using a tiny microphone attached to a bib			0
from @entity338 to @entity339 , @entity340 to the @entity233 and beyond , she says children are extremely alike during this babbling period			0
sounds such as ' b ' , 'd ' , 'm ' and ' g ' combined with ' ah ' seem to be easiest to make , so that ’s where babies start			2
although many parents assume that ' @entity114 ' and ' @entity8 ' are among babies ’ first words because these are the people who are important to them , baby babble does n’t start taking on meaning until around ten months			1
many babies do tend to say ' da ' before ' ma ' , though , because early speech sounds tend to be produced by moving the lips , jaw and soft palate simultaneously			2
this is how we make ' ba ' and ' da ' sounds			0
' @entity362 ' requires us to move the lips and jaw but relax the soft palate — a more complex operation			0
simple sounds : babies say ' @entity8 ' first because its easier to pronounce than the more complex ' @entity114 ' why do we speak to babies in a silly voice ? we ’ve all caught ourselves talking in a sing - song voice to babies , but does sounding silly really serve any purpose ? the fact is , parents across the world show a common pattern when talking to babies			1
they raise the pitch of their voice , speak more slowly , elongate the vowels , repeat themselves and exaggerate changes in intonation			0
and there seems to be a good reason why			0
recent research at @entity389 in the @entity390 showed that elongating vowel sounds when talking to toddlers enhanced their ability to recognise words			0
the exaggerated way we interact with babies seems to be important , too , for capturing their attention			2
