the co-op set up its first farm in @entity43 in 1896 and has had a pharmacy business since 1945			0
but the group has been forced to take the drastic action because of the parlous finances of its bank , which was rescued from collapse in december			0
this involved ceding control of the bank to institutional investors , including @entity56 hedge funds , to plug a huge black hole in its finances			0
the @entity59 is expected on march 26 to announce it made a loss of more than £ 2billion last year , mainly driven by losses at the bank			1
there are fears that thousands of staff across the group could lose their jobs as the co-op prepares to slash its costs by £ 500 million over the next four years			1
yesterday , one of the 200 staff at @entity72 accused the co-op of selling off its ‘ crown jewels ’ to prop up its ‘ floundering businesses ’			0
the worker , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ co-op is in a mess			0
i guess there will be a huge amount of redundancies across the business and i do n’t expect to be in a job in six months			0
’ he added : ‘ it is selling of the jewels in the crown to prop up the bank and the supermarket chain , both of which are floundering			1
’ the @entity59 is expected to announce next month that it made a loss of more than £ 2billion last year the @entity93 , which has almost five million customers , had to be rescued in december after a £ 1.5 billion black hole was discovered in its finances			1

the co-op ’s farms are spread throughout @entity117 and @entity118 , including @entity119 in @entity120 and @entity121 in @entity122			2
they are mainly arable , producing wheat and barley to make cereal , as well as vegetables			2
