we 're all guilty of it but there are some who do it more often than others			2
experts say snacking is an important way to control hunger ; and while we would like to think we reach for something healthy like carrot sticks , raisins or a handful of almonds , more often than not it 's salty crisps , sweet biscuits or cheap chocolate that we tend to munch on			2
ms @entity29 's research has revealed the habits which lead us to nibble needlessly , identifying the behaviours and reasons behind these three distinct snack tribes : ms @entity29 told @entity28 : ' @entity36 are mindless munchers who subconsciously snack , opening something and eating far more than they intended			1
' more often than not , these snackers have no concept of what or how much they are eating			1
according to ms @entity29 , those who are stressed out due to environmental or emotional pressures are @entity37			1
this tribe often have busy schedules which causes them to skip meals			1
then there are the @entity58			1
' they are the snack savvy , who recognise energy lows and tummy grumbles and plan ahead			1
this tribe only nibble sensibly , as and when their body tells them to , ' ms @entity29 said			1
ms @entity29 is encouraging women to revamp their snacking habits by trying the 21 day @entity69 challenge : a simply snack on a handful of almonds once a day for 21 days			1
' snacking is important to help control hunger and provide essential nutrients			2
we all lead such busy lives and juggle a variety of tasks and commitments every day , often resulting in long gaps between meals			1
' @entity83 works well because 21 days is the length of time it takes to form a habit , or swap a bad habit for a good one			2
planning ahead and arming yourself with a handful of almonds will really help to get you through the day			1
' ' as a high source of fibre and containing 15 essential nutrients , almonds are the perfect snack you can feel good about , ' she said			1

to fill up , the situational snacker will grab snacks throughout the day , whilst she can			1
nibbling on the children 's packed lunch leftovers for breakfast whilst she chops up the carrots , snacking in the car for lunch after doing the food shop , or quickly scoffing half a sandwich before the company meeting is common for this type of snacker			0
if you 're a ' @entity124 ' you might find that emotional pressures , stress and a particularly busy day can cause you to snack , even if not hungry , and you may be particularly prone to pick at food as a comfort mechanism			1
@entity29 ' advice : ' almost three quarters ( 73 per cent ) of women in the @entity33 said that stress lead them to overlook their nutrient intake			0
this is an issue i often see , and it can have a serious impact on health			0
if women are n't dedicating time to their diet and thinking carefully about their nutrient intake , they could be at risk of over or under eating			0
' the key is to snack sensibly and make sure you have something nutritious to nibble on at your desk , in the kitchen , in the car , or wherever the hunger pangs strike			1
the nutrients in almonds make them a perfect snack to enjoy between meals			1
almonds are also a high source of magnesium , which contributes to a reduction of tiredness and fatigue , so they really are the perfect snack to keep you going through a busy day			1
' if you are a snack - amnesiac : throughout her day , the @entity102 will graze on the foods closest to hand , without even realising she 's doing it			1
munching through a share - size bag of crisps whilst watching the telly when she only meant to eat a handful , reaching for the plate of biscuits during a lull in the board meeting and even waking up in the middle of the night and sleepwalking to the kitchen to nibble on some leftovers from the fridge are just a few examples of the mindless snacking habit in action			1
do you find yourself opening a packet of biscuits only meaning to eat one , but suddenly the packet is empty ? if you were asked to remember everything you 'd nibbled on throughout the day , would you remember every mouthful ? if you find yourself snacking on food without even realising , you could well be a @entity102 and you 're not alone – research commissioned by the @entity30 of @entity31 has shown that 90 per cent of women in the @entity33 admit to snacking mindlessly throughout the day			0
@entity29 ' advice : ' research has shown that women are typically lacking in fibre and often eat higher levels of the daily recommended allowance of saturated fat			0
' with 90 per cent of women suspected of suffering from @entity236 and eating anything close to hand without taking the nutrient content into account , it is n't difficult to see how diets become unbalanced			0
however , if you are a ' @entity131 , ' there are easy ways you can ensure you 're still achieving a balanced diet			0
almonds are a high source of fibre and just a handful ( approximately 30g or 23 almonds ) a day can boost your nutrient intake			0
these great little nuts are also high in unsaturated fat , and in fact , a recent study published in the @entity253 found that a mid-morning snack of almonds helped control appetite and resulted in reduced calorie intake by the participants during the rest of the day			1
if @entity262 keep a handful of almonds close by , this could help to curb the cravings and the mindless munching later in the day			2
if you are a @entity132 : the @entity132 is a woman who is well aware of her snacking habits and despite a busy day , or the odd sweet craving , she 'll do what she can to stay strong and find the foods she needs to help get her through – no matter what the day might bring			2
busy day of meetings and no time for lunch – the super snacker will ensure she 's got a steady supply of her favourite nutritional snacks pre-packed and close to hand to see her through			2
prone to an afternoon lull – the @entity132 will have a nutritious pick - me up ready to go			0
craving an evening treat after a long day – the @entity132 will reach for a snack from the well - stocked healthy snack jar			2
do you pack a snack in your handbag each day ? are you familiar with the times of day that you need an extra boost ? if so , like one in five women in the @entity33 , you could be a @entity132			2
@entity29 ' advice : ' well - balanced snacking is a great way to stay on top of your hunger pangs and ensure a daily dose of the nutrients that your body needs			2
but healthy and happy snacking need n't be difficult or dull			0
' as most @entity58 know , there are some simple tricks to help adopt happy snacking habits			1
mixing up different textures and flavours adds variety to your daily food intake			0
' pack a punch with a nutritiously crunchy handful of almonds added to some mango for sweetness , or even dark chocolate for a more indulgent snack			2
