guests staying at the hotel in 2007 told lawyers of the ' awful ' conditions including : looks nice : the @entity16 beach , near to the resort			2

mrs @entity91 said : ' the state of the hotel was really awful – we were told we were booking a four - star resort , however the hotel room did n’t even look like it had been properly cleaned			2
' the dining area was very off - putting as there were always birds flying around and landing on tables			1
the food on the buffet was left uncovered for long periods of time , exposing it to the insects that were constantly flying around and we often saw plates covered in flies			1
' after the honeymoon couple both fell ill , mr @entity80 went to visit the hotel doctor – only to find that there was a huge queue of people also waiting to be seen and who were complaining of the same symptoms			2
