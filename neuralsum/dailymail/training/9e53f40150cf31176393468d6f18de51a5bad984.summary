@entity9 , host of a sunday morning @entity2 show that bears her name , cut the promo spot to promote her program			1
and conservative pundits @entity14 and @entity16 are seeing red			1
' we have never invested as much in public education as we should have , ' @entity18 says in the ad , ' because we 've always had kind of a private notion of children : " your kid is yours , and totally your responsibility			2
" we have n't had a very collective notion of " these are our children			1
" ' ' so part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents , or kids belong to their families , and recognize that kids belong to whole communities			2
@entity14 , the former @entity53 governor and 2008 @entity55 vice presidential nominee , vented her outrage on @entity57			1

' the theme of collective child - rearing first most famously caused trouble for @entity65 liberals when @entity67 , then the first lady , made a similar argument in her book titled @entity70			1

' ' so , i do n’t really have responsibility for my kids			0
i can look to the state to also take that responsibility and , quite honestly , that burden from me			0
' @entity16 editorialized that @entity2 did n't make a gaffe but was consciously endorsing a socialist view of child - rearing			1
' this is not a mistake , ' he said on @entity98			0
' this is the announcement of where they ’re headed			1
' ' what ’s really horrible about this , ' @entity16 added , is the idea behind this is going to be so appealing to so many people			2
' @entity106 reported that according to an @entity108 report , the @entity65 already spends more money per pupil on education than any other country in the world @entity2 's ' @entity114 ; series of ad promos came under fire in 2012 for its similarity to the @entity121 re-election campaign 's use of ' forward ' as a slogan			0
