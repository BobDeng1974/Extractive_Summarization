@entity1 star @entity0 scored the winner as @entity3 beat @entity4 in @entity5 to continue @entity7 's perfect start as coach			1
the decisive moment came on the half - hour when @entity10 curled a free - kick over the defence to @entity0 , who controlled and finished with the outside of his right foot			1
@entity0 was part of a @entity1 trio on the pitch at the @entity18 , with @entity19 and @entity20 also impressing as @entity3 continued their recovery from the summer 's @entity23 nightmare			1
' there were n't any negative points , ' he said			2
' you have to take the positives from the negatives			0
you learn , you evolve			0
so for me it was all positive			0
' the players played well against two very good teams			0
the team raised its ability depending on how difficult the situations were			0
all the players on this team i felt made the most of their opportunities in these games			0
' @entity3 were some way from their best but with just seven survivors from the @entity23 squad on the @entity77 trip , it will take time to again forge a successful side			2
indeed , @entity4 could have come away with a draw when @entity110 's @entity109 struck the base of the post after beating goalkeeper @entity38 witha right - foot shot			1
denied : @entity10 sees a chance smothered by @entity4 goalkeeper @entity32 painful : @entity10 screams as he is tackled by @entity4 's @entity115 appeal : @entity10 gestures on the floor to referee @entity76 after being fouled taking a dive : @entity44 goes to ground under a challenge from @entity121 he also saw a looping header cleared off the line by @entity43 during the second half as @entity4 enjoyed a productive spell			1
but @entity10 could have made absolutely sure of victory in the 47th minute , only to miss an open goal from four yards with the goalkeeper beaten			2
@entity3 's defensive quartet of @entity39 , @entity42 , @entity41 and @entity43 performed well and @entity7 gave debuts to @entity131 striker @entity48 and @entity132 defender @entity40 from the bench			1
aerial battle : @entity4 's @entity62 goes up for a header with @entity3 's @entity42 ( left ) @entity136 to head : @entity10 is pushed off the ball by @entity56 not involved : @entity138 sat on the @entity3 bench but played no part in the match @entity10 , who has returned to action following the back injury sustained at the @entity23 , saw the best of the first - half chances with an ambitious shot and a free - kick that both cleared the crossbar			1
but @entity7 was pleased with how the star performed : ' he 's got a good personality and everybody is different			2
but players react differently to being a leader and he went out there tonight and showed he could play			0
' this is one of those games that he has played 90 minutes since the @entity23 , and i thought he played well			0
