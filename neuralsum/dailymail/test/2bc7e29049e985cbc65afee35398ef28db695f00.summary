with its blend of @entity2 and @entity4 culture , it did n’t take us long to discover the unique appeal of @entity7			1
soon after arriving by high - speed @entity8 from @entity10 , we were sitting in @entity11 , a beautifully tiled restaurant that could easily have been in @entity12			0
the food and drink was excellent ( owner @entity15 whips up a mean souffle ) , and the fado singing of entertainer @entity18 was truly memorable			0
it was run by @entity32 until 1999 when it became a special @entity33 of @entity4			1
wandering with our guide through @entity7 ’s @entity37 the next morning , it was evident how the @entity2 influence has been maintained through the architecture and cobbled streets			1
the highlights for us were the @entity42 ’s , elegant @entity43 , and @entity44 , which is more than 500 years old			0
my husband @entity45 and i were impressed by just how clean and tidy @entity7 is – they even have wcs for dogs with entrances marked in and @entity51			1
@entity52 and her husband travelled to the city and it did n’t take them long to discover the unique appeal of @entity7 after lunch at @entity59 ( a fusion of @entity2 , @entity4 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity65 flavours – it works ! ) we headed over to the @entity66 , which has the world ’s highest bungee jump			1
plunging 764ft in 17 seconds is not for the faint - hearted , but neither is @entity69 , where you are harnessed and take a thrilling – if that ’s the word – walk around the outer rim of the @entity66 with nothing to hold on to			2
we were disappointed that , for technical reasons , we were n’t able to see the multi-million - pound production of @entity77			0
incredible skyline ! view of @entity80 and @entity81 at dusk developed by the man behind many of @entity87 ’s dazzling shows , it features acrobats , motorcycle stunts and fountain effects			0
@entity91 and many people automatically think ‘ casinos ’			2
there are 26 of them , including the world ’s biggest , the @entity22			2
it looks the size of @entity100 and has about 500 baccarat , roulette and blackjack tables			0
contrasting scenery ! the peaceful @entity29 island is world 's apart from @entity7 gambling is illegal in @entity10 , except on horseracing , so thousands from @entity10 as well as mainland @entity4 try their luck here			1
free shuttle buses run between the casinos , and as the doorman at our hotel , the @entity116 , said : ‘ it ’s either that or a @entity118 ! ’ lord @entity119 is the home to the @entity2 egg custard tart the island of @entity29 , meanwhile , has green hills , small villages and a peaceful coastline			1
in the @entity128 we were intrigued to find lord @entity119 , home to the @entity2 egg custard tart			0
launched by @entity132 @entity131 in 1989 , the store is now run by his sister @entity133 , and it sells more than 3,000 of the delicacies every day			0
@entity7 has a typhoon season from june to september when the bridges can be closed , but a long tunnel keeps the traffic flowing			1
as a destination , it is far cheaper than @entity10 and there is plenty of accommodation			0
the food is wonderful , and when you stir in the @entity2 heritage and influence , you get a fascinating and colourful melting pot. @entity149 ( wendywutours.co.uk , 0844 875 2436 ) offers a five - day @entity10 and @entity152 tour from £ 1,099pp , including return flights , @entity155 accommodation , transfers , half - day @entity10 tour , @entity7 city tour with lunch and direct ferry to @entity7			1
