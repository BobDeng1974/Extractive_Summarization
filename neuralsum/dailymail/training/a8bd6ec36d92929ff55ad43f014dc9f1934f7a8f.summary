@entity0 has made the computer code behind behind its first operating system , @entity2 , available for free - and revealed programmers included jokes in their code			1
launched in 1982 , @entity2 , the ' @entity6 ' was @entity0 's first commercial operating system			1
it has now released to code the @entity9 ( @entity10 ) - prompting users to comb it for jokes left by the firm 's programmers			1
the @entity2 code also refers to @entity17			2
@entity18 went outside the company for many hardware and software components of their 1981 personal computer			2
though most vendors were kept in the dark about the project , code - named “ chess , ” @entity18 developed a unique relationship between their @entity30 - based team and @entity0 , then a small company based in @entity31			2
@entity0 , which was providing the basic language interpreter , agreed to also supply an operating system			2
without their own operating system already in place , they licensed a product from nearby @entity38 and worked closely with @entity18 to make the changes they wanted			0
it shipped as " @entity42 " for @entity18 and " @entity2 " for other pc manufacturers			2
the gags include references to programmers being ' gods ' , comments calling users ' dumb ' ; and references to @entity17 ' shake ' speare - along wiht liberal use of the word f * * k. they were found by internet user @entity56 , who posted them to his @entity59 account			0
the code was given to the @entity9 ( @entity10 ) in the heart of @entity63 's @entity62			0
it announced that it has , with permission from @entity0 , made available original source code for two historic programs : @entity2 , the 1982 ' @entity6 ' for @entity18 - compatible personal computers , and @entity69 , the 1990 @entity70 - based version of their word processor			1
' @entity73 fits an entire operating system – limited as it was – into only 12k bytes of memory , which is tiny compared to today 's software , ' said @entity78 , @entity10 chairman			0
the first @entity79 , the 5150 , that went to the market on august 11 1981			0
with a price of 3,280 dollars			0
it was a machine of 11 kg , 15 cm of height with a small black and green screen of 11.5 inches , and ran @entity0 's @entity2 software			1
' we think preserving historic source code like these two programs is key to understanding how software has evolved from primitive roots to become a crucial part of our civilization			1
' ' @entity2 and @entity69 built the foundation for @entity0 ’s success in the technology industry , ” said @entity97 , distinguished engineer and managing director , @entity100			1
' by contributing these source codes to the @entity9 archives , @entity0 is making these historic systems from the early era of personal computing available to the community for historical and technical scholarship			1
' @entity18 went outside the company for many hardware and software components of their 1981 personal computer			2
the in - jokes also include using the word hack repeatedly though most vendors were kept in the dark about the project , code - named “ chess , ” @entity18 developed a unique relationship between their @entity30 - based team and @entity0 , then a small company based in @entity31			1
@entity0 , which was providing the basic language interpreter , agreed to also supply an operating system			0
without their own operating system already in place , they licensed a product from nearby @entity38 and worked closely with @entity18 to make the changes they wanted			0
it shipped as " @entity42 " for @entity18 and " @entity2 " for other pc manufacturers			0
the code contains several gas , including this one claiming the programmers are ' gods ' one snippet of code slams users as dumb for using a network supplied by hardware firm @entity137			0
we are today releasing the source code of @entity2 version 1.1 from 1982 , and of version 2.0 from 1983			1
@entity0 's @entity6 - based version of @entity69 , first released in 1983 , was not a success against the dominant word processor of that era , @entity146			1
the 1989 release of @entity69 changed all that : within four years it was generating over half the worldwide word processing market revenue			0
it was a remarkable marketing and engineering achievement			0
we are today revealing the technical magic by releasing the source code to version 1.1a of @entity69 .			1

@entity0 has made the source code of @entity2 and @entity69 available for the first time
@entity2 was launched in 1981 for @entity160 first personal computers
code includes jokes left by programmers never before seen
