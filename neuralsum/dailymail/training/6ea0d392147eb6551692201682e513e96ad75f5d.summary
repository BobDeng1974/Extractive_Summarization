by @entity0 on a typical day , in the height of summer , around 30,000 flights travel through @entity4 airspace			1
to showcase the complex and detailed routes these flights take , and how they manage to fly across the continent without crashing into each other , @entity5 ( formerly known as the @entity5 ) has created a beautiful timelapse video			2
this video tracks the movement of flights over the course of 24 hours last summer and has been condensed to just two minutes			0
the visualisation , pictured , was created by the @entity18 air traffic controller @entity5 ( formerly known as the @entity5 )			1
it used @entity18 radar data from june last year , combined with @entity4 flight plan information from july , to showcase a day 's worth of air travel in just two minutes the data visualisation is an amalgamation of @entity18 radar data , taken on 21 june 2013 , combined with @entity4 flight plan information from 28 july last year			1
@entity27 , a @entity5 spokesman , told @entity28 : ' airspace is an incredibly valuable asset - just as important as the rail , road and utility networks that everyone relies on everyday			0
however , most people are n’t aware of the work that goes into managing and safely guiding aircraft through our skies			0
' that ’s why we created this visualisation to highlight the complexity of that work , the skill of our air traffic controllers and the @entity18 ’s strategic importance as the aviation gateway to @entity4 and @entity49			1
' to create the video , viualisation experts from a company called 422 @entity53 combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all @entity18 flights on one of the busiest days of last year , and blended it with flight schedules and routing information for the rest of @entity4 - reaching out into the @entity60			1
on 21 june 2013 , 5,675 aircraft departed or arrived from @entity18 airports , this included 847 from @entity63 and 1,041 from @entity64			1
the rest travelled to and from other @entity18 airports			2
a total of 1,532 were classed as overflights , which travelled over the country			0
this still from the video shows the level of traffic around @entity64 and @entity63 during a single morning computer artists then used specially developed programmes to convert the longitude , latitude and height data into luminous dots , which were accurately positioned over satellite images of @entity18 and mainland @entity4 , by day and by night			2
@entity27 continued : ' @entity4 airspace is some of the busiest and most complex anywhere in the world			0
every day thousands of air traffic controllers guide millions of passengers safely to their destinations			0
' yet to most people , the choreography going on above them is entirely unnoticed - it quite literally goes over their heads			0
some might say that is how it should be			0
but , that ignores one very important point			0
getting it right matters and we all have a stake in it			0
' according to @entity5 , of the 30,000 flights that travel across @entity4 airspace on a typical july day , approximately a quarter fly within @entity18 controlled airspace			1
to create the video , viualisation experts from a company called 422 @entity53 combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all @entity18 flights on one of the busiest days of last year , and blended it with flight schedules and routing information for the rest of @entity4 , pictured this data also extended into the @entity60 , pictured			1
computer artists then used specially developed programmes to convert the longitude , latitude and height data into luminous dots , which were accurately positioned over satellite images of @entity18 and mainland @entity4 , by day and by night the total distance flown by these aircraft is 25 million nautical miles - the equivalent to 998 times around the @entity126 or 104 trips to the @entity128			1
on 21 june 2013 , 5,675 aircraft departed or arrived from @entity18 airports , this included 847 from @entity63 and 1,041 from @entity64			1
the rest ( 1,532 ) were classed as overflights which travelled over the country			0
the @entity5 video is 1440x faster than real time			0
' a few highlights include the @entity60 tracks that connect @entity4 with @entity49 , the airways that run up the spine of the @entity18 , the holding stacks at @entity142 's capacity stretched airports and the military manoeuvres off @entity145 in @entity146 , ' said @entity5 in a blog post			1
@entity5 is the main air navigation service provider for the @entity18 that provides air traffic control services to flights within the @entity18 @entity151 as well as the @entity152			2
it also provides traffic control to fifteen airports in the @entity18 airports , plus @entity155 .			2

the visualisation was created by the @entity18 air traffic controller @entity5 ( formerly known as @entity5 )
it used @entity18 radar data and @entity4 flight information from june and july to showcase a day 's worth of air travel
highlights include the @entity60 tracks that connect @entity4 with @entity49 and military flights in @entity146
on a typical july day there are around 30,000 flights across @entity4 airspace and a quarter fly within @entity18 airspace
the total distance flown by these aircraft is 25 million nautical miles - equivalent to 998 times around the @entity126
on 21 june , 5,675 aircraft departed or arrived from @entity18 airports including *894* from @entity63 and 1,041 from @entity64
