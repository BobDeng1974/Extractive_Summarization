all eyes are on @entity1 right now - as two @entity3 youngsters are being asked to be the talisman for their team			0
@entity6 is seen as the man to rescue a sub-standard season at @entity9 and @entity10 is expected to take over from @entity11 as @entity13 's big hope			1
hang on , is n't it a bit unfair to be asking so much of these players ? @entity10 should look to move to @entity18 and become @entity20 's first real superstar @entity6 should head to @entity21 and be nurtured into a top talent in my view it might be best for both if they leave for pastures new			1
they 've both shown flashes of brilliance - you have to be in football denial to not recognise how talented these two are			0
saying they have the ability to shine at the top level in the future is one thing , making unreasonable demands on them on the pitch prematurely is something very different			0
@entity9 and @entity13 are both giants , and to place so much expectation on their shoulders at this stage of their careers is plain wrong			2
both had their breakthrough seasons in 2013 - 14 , and both have been patchy with their form this campaign - that 's to be expected given their inexperience			2
@entity9 have failed this season due to defensive weaknesses and because @entity56 has n't delivered value for money so far			0
but this highlights some major issues with the @entity9 squad : the defence is ageing , while the players they seem to be relying on to spark up their season are too young for that responsibility - both @entity56 and @entity6 are still only 21			2
in @entity6 's case i suspect that @entity68 will seriously consider trading him in for a fee of £ 30 - £ 40million in the summer so he can rebuild his squad			1
having splurged £ 28m on @entity56 with limited return so far , i ca n't see the board making much cash available unless the manager sells first			0
that price tag will bring its own pressures but as @entity77 showed 10 years ago , if you 're good enough you 'll be able to handle it			2
and let 's keep the theme going : @entity21 is exactly the right club for @entity6			1
the fans tend to back the youngsters there , and under @entity86 his education would be ideal			0
sure there are expectations at @entity21 , but he 'll be surrounded by better players who can take that pressure off him			1
that is n't happening at @entity92			0
@entity77 moved to @entity21 from @entity9 and has developed well - @entity6 should follow that path @entity10 seems set to sign a new deal at @entity13 but i ca n't help thinking he 's missing a great opportunity to do something very special			1
he could be the first young @entity3 football superstar to move to a @entity99 giant and make his mark			1
@entity13 might not make the @entity101 next year , and they 're already out of it this season			0
get that move to @entity105 or @entity106 , do your thing abroad and become one of the greats			2
see what @entity111 has done in a short space of time over there - why would n't @entity10 want some of that ? do what @entity117 did – it is not a crime to leave @entity13 and go elsewhere to win the @entity101			1
at @entity121 , @entity10 saw @entity122 leave last year , and he 'll lose @entity11 this summer			1
@entity122 was n't replaced , and it seems @entity124 is talking up @entity125 as @entity11 's successor			2
i like @entity125 , but @entity13 need big players , stellar names , if they are to get back to where they were			0
@entity111 ( left ) has matured brilliantly at @entity105 and there is no reason why @entity10 could not do the same all the pressure to provide the magic will be on @entity10			1
does he need that pressure ? he 's destined for bigger things than being the great hope at @entity13 , a club that might make it back to the big time every season , or might not			2
@entity10 should be one of several top players at a club firmly established as one of the most competitive in @entity18			0
i know @entity13 and @entity9 are giants , but right now those clubs are putting too much pressure on the shoulders of young superstars			0
they 've done great work developing these players , but that is being put at risk with the demands placed on them			0
@entity10 dribbles with the ball for @entity13 during their @entity158 draw with @entity159 neither club will make the top four this season , and unless one of them wins the @entity164 they wo n't be playing @entity101 football next term			1
@entity10 and @entity6 are n't bigger than the clubs they currently play for - they never will be			1
but right now they are too good for them			0
and that 's why they need to move away			0
@entity6 advances with the ball for @entity9 as @entity176 's @entity175 looks on @entity10 celebrates scoring for @entity13 during their @entity158 victory over @entity178 on @entity179			1

@entity10 and @entity6 are *hindered* by unrealistic expectations
@entity6 should move to @entity21 to develop like @entity77
@entity10 is expected to replace @entity11 as @entity13 's heartbeat
but he could become @entity20 's first real @entity99 superstar at @entity105
