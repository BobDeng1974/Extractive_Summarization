@entity1 stars are forced to hand in their mobile phones the night before a match under strict new rules from manager @entity5			1
the @entity6 has laid down the law since taking over from @entity8 this summer and also drops any player who is late for breakfast on the morning of a game			1
but so far , @entity13 's methods have failed to yield results with @entity1 failing to win any of their first three @entity16 fixtures			0
@entity13 has a history of taking a no - nonsense approach to management			2
in @entity37 's biography of his compatriot , he wrote that while in charge of @entity40 , @entity13 fined players if they were even a minute late for breakfast - it was doubled if it happened again			1
the squad also had to start eating together and @entity13 preferred that they only talk about football			0
at @entity1 , the 63 - year - old ordered the first team and the youth squads to eat together while he introduced a strict 1pm lunch and the installation of £ 500,000 worth of hd cameras at @entity1 's @entity54 training centre			1
training days : @entity13 had £ 500,000 worth of cameras installed at @entity1 's @entity54 training centre defender @entity58 said during the club 's @entity60 tour in pre-season : ‘ we have this system at the minute where he can watch us on the pitch			1
the manager is saying , “ you should be five yards to the right ”			0
‘ we went through a video last night and i was 10 yards out			2
there are things you are doing on the pitch , and the whole team will be feeling the same , where you are thinking , " am i in the right position ? " then the manager will show you in the video and you will know			0
' the mobile phone rule was introduced by sir @entity80 in an attempt to prevent the leak of team news			0
