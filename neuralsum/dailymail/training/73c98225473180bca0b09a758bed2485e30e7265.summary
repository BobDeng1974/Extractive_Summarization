@entity2 manager @entity1 's never - ending injury problems plummeted to new low after losing two more players			1
the @entity5 secured their passage into the @entity8 group stages with a 2 - 0 win over @entity10 - but their glee was tempered by injuries to captain @entity13 ( calf ) and @entity15 ( hamstring )			1
' the injury situation is a problem because we have many games , ' said @entity1			2
@entity13 injured his calf muscle during the second half of @entity2 's win over @entity10 @entity13 immediately signalled to the bench to confirm he was injured and would need to be taken off @entity13 looks in pain as he hobbles after picking up a calf injury @entity13 and @entity27 will be assessed at the club 's @entity28 on thursday to establish the prognosis			1
but the @entity32 's loss will spark a change in transfer strategy from the @entity5 when the january window re-opens			2
@entity37 's ankle injury had already forced @entity1 into rethinking his transfer plans			2
@entity15 scored @entity2 's first goal against @entity10 at the @entity40 on wednesday night @entity27 ( second right ) also had to come off injured himself , later in the game the @entity2 manager is still prioritising the capture of at least two central defenders ; a position the @entity5 have been dreadfully short this season			1
but , even prior to wednesday night , @entity1 is also now looking to sign a central midfielder to replace @entity37 - who could be out for four months if he needs surgery on his injured left ankle			1
@entity53 's @entity52 remains @entity1 's dream signing , but @entity55 understands they are also showing an interest in @entity58 's @entity57 , who could be cheaper option			0
their defensive targets include @entity62 's @entity61 , @entity64 's @entity63 and @entity67 left - back @entity65			0
but @entity13 's injury will only heighten @entity1 's desire to sign a new central midfielder when the window re-opens			1
@entity27 celebrates scoring his first goal for @entity2 - before picking up a hamstring injury @entity2 expect to discover whether or not @entity37 will require surgery when he sees a specialist			2
@entity13 , @entity76 and @entity37 join an already lengthy @entity2 injury list			1
@entity78 ( knee ) , @entity80 ( knee ) , @entity82 ( hip ) , @entity84 ( ankle ) , @entity86 ( groin ) and @entity88 ( thigh ) all missed the clash through injury			0
despite the setbacks , @entity2 produced a fine 2 - 0 win against @entity10 to confirm their place in the last 16 of the @entity8			1
on his side 's 15th consecutive qualification for the @entity8 knockout stages , @entity1 added : ' when you work at the football club we realise it 's not easy to have that continuity and consistency and i 'm very proud of that			0
' the club deserves a lot of credit for that			0
but it 's not enough , we want more than that			0
' the focus to defend well together			0
we had a similar game to saturday ( a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity64 ) but we focused really well			1
it was a committed game , and maybe defensively we were better tonight			0
' we have done our job			0
we want now to focus on the @entity117 and to wait now for who we get in the draw			0

@entity2 produced a fine *performance* to beat @entity10 2 - 0
@entity13 had to come off after injuring his calf during the game
@entity1 afterwards confirmed that he will be ' out for a while '
@entity15 scored for the @entity5 but also got injured himself
