by @entity0 published : 02:45 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 4 may 2013 before man became brave enough to conquer space himself , canine cosmonauts were sent in our place			2
it was a perilous job , with almost half of all dogs destined not to come home			2
but two female strays employed in the @entity12 space programme , @entity13 and @entity14 , proved to be remarkable survivors			1
canine cosmonauts : @entity13 , left , and @entity14 , right , survived a failed rocket launch in december , 1960 during a mission , the pair plummeted 125 miles to @entity20 after their rocket malfunctioned and remained trapped inside for four days in the @entity24 wilderness			1
to the astonishment of the @entity12 authorities , they were found alive			1
their incredible story , as reported by @entity30 , has only just emerged after being kept secret for more than 50 years			0
on december 22 , 1960 , the space dogs - who had been picked after surviving a rough life on the streets - were launched from @entity36 on board a @entity39 spacecraft			1
it was @entity13 's third space flight , having twice been sent into orbit the previous year			2
but this launch would prove to be disastrous			2
the rocket failed to reach orbit after suffering a malfunction in the third stage of the rocket			1
@entity49 , who was in charge of training the @entity12 space dogs , found @entity13 and @entity14 still alive inside the failed rocket capsule the emergency systems sprung into action and the rocket plunged back to @entity20 , crashing some 2,200 miles from the launch site			1
' at the beginning of the third stage the engine failed , ' said @entity60 , a close colleague of @entity61 , the lead @entity12 rocket engineer and spacecraft designer			1
' the control system gave the order to separate the ship , and according to the calculations it was to be found in @entity68			1
' was the ship damaged ? how did it land after the accident ? ' what happened to the dogs that were to be catapulted in their container on @entity77 frost ? these were the questions we had no answers for			0
' in temperatures of minus @entity84 , a search group from the @entity82 was sent to try to find the wreckage			0
four days later the remains of the rocket were found near the village of @entity89 , between the rivers @entity91 and @entity92			1
crucially , the two female dogs remained inside the insulated module due to failure of the ejection system , a fact which saved their lives in the perishing conditions			1
on christmas morning , rescuer @entity49 began to open the capsule and could hear quiet barking			0
' they were alive despite the most pessimistic forecasts , ' he said			0
@entity49 wrapped the frozen and exhausted animals in his coat and went back to @entity106 by helicopter			0
he described them as being ' in a state half death because of the shock after crashing down and ...			0
the cold in which they had to spend time till they were found '			0
the rocket 's ejection system failed , keeping the dogs trapped inside and protecting them from the perishing conditions of the @entity24 wilderness the rocket crashed some 2,200 miles from the launch site where temperatures were minus @entity84 records show @entity49 took them back to @entity125 where they were said to be ' feeling good ' the next day			1
the fate of @entity14 after returning to @entity125 is not known			2
but @entity13 was adopted by academic @entity128 , a specialist in aviation medicine , with whom she lived for 14 years			0
after her @entity24 adventure , she went on to have puppies			2
' she was such a cute , fluffy , fair - haired dog with a sharp nose , ' he said			0
' she was a hero , flying as many as three times - twice in rockets , and a third on board the satellite , the forerunner of the ship which was used for @entity145 's flight '			0
the spacecraft 's designer @entity61 wanted to make the news of @entity13 and @entity14 's faile flight public but was banned from doing so by @entity12 officialdom			1
as a result , their heroic adventure has not been properly recorded in many histories of space animals - until now			0
@entity13 was adopted by academic @entity128 following her adventures and went on to have puppies			0

@entity160 and @entity14 were launched into space in december 1960
@entity12 rocket failed and crashed back to @entity20 2,200 miles from launch site
dogs were found still in space capsule after ejection system also failed
despite four days in @entity24 wilderness they were still alive
