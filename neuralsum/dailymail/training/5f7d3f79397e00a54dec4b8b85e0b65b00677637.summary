by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 and @entity3 questioned the state of the @entity6 pitch following @entity8 ’s shootout victory over @entity9 in @entity10			1
@entity9 ’s @entity12 team @entity10 will play in the iconic stadium when they launch next year , but at times on wednesday night the players struggled to keep their footing on the sandy turf that had been laid over the baseball quadrant in one corner of the pitch			1
@entity2 could not help joking when asked about the state of the surface			1
‘ i thought three - quarters of it was excellent , ’ said the @entity8 boss			1
@entity25 sport : the part of the pitch used for the baseball quadrant was not in the best of conditions ( left ) poor show : part of the @entity6 pitch ( left ) was in bad condition for the friendly ‘ there was a patch over on the right - hand side which i presume might be where the pitcher stands			1
but i thought you saw a very good game of football			2
’ @entity3 admitted that the surface was too dry , saying : ‘ maybe it was not the best pitch to play football , but it was n’t so bad			1
we did n’t have any problems with the players			2
‘ it would be better to play with the pitch in better condition and maybe more wet			1
maybe it was a little bit dry and that ’s why the ball did n’t run so fast , but there was n’t any problem for both teams			2
’ meanwhile , @entity2 challenged @entity62 to hit double figures for the season after seeing him score @entity8 ’s first goal in a 2 - 2 draw			1
the @entity68 midfielder was also on target in the penalty shootout as he gave a man - of - the - match performance			1
asked if @entity62 needs to produce more goals , @entity2 said : ‘ yes , i think that was the objective when i spoke to @entity62 this year because he has the quality			1
that finish for the equaliser , he does that day in day out in training			2
he ’s so fit and strong , and such a team player , he does a lot of unselfish work for the team , but this year we ’re asking him to get into the box more			2
‘ i thought he had more opportunities when he played just round the corner in the last 20 minutes and then he was able to time his runs forward better going forward			2
he got in a few times and was unlucky			2
he can really penetrate the defensive line and he ’s an athlete who can run all day			2
more like this : @entity2 has called on @entity62 ( left ) to find the net more regularly get in : @entity62 ( left ) celebrates after drawing @entity8 level against @entity9 in @entity10 ‘ i would expect him to get upwards of 10 goals this season because he has the quality and the tactical nous to arrive in the areas to do that			1
’ @entity2 was delighted with his team ’s performance as they came from behind to win after @entity104 twice put @entity9 ahead			1
victory in saturday ’s last game against @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity109 , will guarantee @entity8 a place in the final of the @entity112 in @entity113 on monday			1
‘ i thought overall the players were excellent , ’ he said			0
‘ we scored two goals and could have scored three more			0
@entity117 made three outstanding saves			0
and then we showed composure to finish the penalties			1
‘ for us at this moment in pre-season it was a great game			0
@entity9 are a wonderful team and they will go close in the @entity125 again this year			1
‘ what we ’re overall is a trademark of this team over the last 18 months and that ’s character			0
even though it was a pre-season game it was highly competitive , the players showed the character to keep going and come back			0
it was a really good game			0
more to come : @entity2 ( centre ) has promised to make more signings before the transfer window closes ‘ i thought the goals we conceded were unfortunate			1
@entity104 is very bright and alive in the box			0
we were unfortunate with the first goal that deflected off @entity143 and he got a toe on it			0
the second goal as well was something similar			0
we have to respect the quality we were playing against			0
they ’re a top side , one of the best teams in @entity151			0
’ @entity2 confirmed that he expects to being in more new signings before next month ’s transfer deadline despite a busy summer in the transfer market			1
‘ we still have some business to do , ’ he added			0
‘ we have some positions that we want to fill so by the end of august we ’ll have a strong squad to go forward with			0
‘ we ’ve brought in specific players for specific roles , players who have the profile of how we work			0
of course it will them take a bit more time than normal in terms of their induction but the transition has been very smooth			0
‘ they ’re good characters with good personality who fit the criteria we want in terms of the model of our game			0
that should make the adjustment that bit easier			2
but of course some of them are young and coming from a different country like @entity183 so that will take a little bit of time			0

@entity9 and @entity8 drew 2 - 2 in @entity10
@entity8 won 3 - 1 on penalties
part of the pitch which is normally used for the baseball quadrant was in poor condition
@entity2 *vowed* to make more signings this summer
