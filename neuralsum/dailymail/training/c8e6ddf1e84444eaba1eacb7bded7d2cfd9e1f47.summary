by @entity0 it was a city known for its beautiful beaches and boasts one of the longest cherry blossom tree tunnels in @entity5			2
but after a tsunami and a nuclear disaster both struck in the space of 12 months , @entity6 was turned into a ghost city			1
these eerie images , captured by a drone , show what is left of the area near @entity16 that had to be abandoned overnight			0
more than 15,000 residents living in 6,000 houses were forced to evacuate in march 2011 because of safety fears concerning dangerous radiation levels			1
three years on , schools and business are still prevented from returning while parks , playgrounds , roads and the city 's train station have been left covered in overgrown grass			0
a total of 300,000 people have been evacuated from the east coast of the country since the disasters and 15,884 have died			0
the beach used to be popular with tourists in the summer stuck : a fishing vessel that was washed ashore during the devastating tsunami still lies on the side of the road isolated : the boat has been left there for three years on the outskirts of the deserted city , which was evacuated because of radiation fears following the nuclear disaster playground : a children 's swing set that has not been used since the city was abandoned lies in the middle of overgrown grass and below a cherry blossom tree worship : a group of statues line up along a footpath leading towards a shrine			1
it is surrounded by chains to prevent intruders from going inside last stop : the train station has become overgrown in the years after the town was evacuated			0
residents were asked to leave in 2011 for fears of their safety following the nuclear disaster empty platforms : the images , including those of the empty station , were caught on a drone which hovered over the abandoned community ruined : signs that would welcome people into the station are left hanging from the derelict platform			1
the overheard lines used to power the trains have also collapsed eerie : a home destroyed by the tsunami , which was triggered by an earthquake , is left surrounded by debris nature : the desolate buildings surround the city 's beautiful cherry blossom tunnel , one of the biggest in @entity5 broken : windows have been shattered in houses around the city and floors have been cleared away aerial view : the drone captures how the edge of the city , the train station and the coastline have been devastated by the natural disasters stripped away : storeys in homes are barely standing			0
many of the grass areas and gardens in the city have been left to overgrow cleared out : pieces of furniture and old toys are scattered over the floor in front of an abandoned building crumbled : a large hole in the side of a house created by the tsunami which struck in 2011			2
the city did have 15,000 residents living in 6,000 properties rusting : a set of monkey bars sits in a park next to a house			1
almost 300,000 people have been evacuated across the @entity16 coastal region empty : an abandoned car lies in the middle of a field in @entity6			1
an earthquake off the east coast caused the nuclear meltdown remains : clothes still hang from a line outside an empty apartment			0
it shows how quicky the residents were forced to leave power : a solar panel is still harnessing sunlight and generating electricity , despite there being no residents to use the resources			2
