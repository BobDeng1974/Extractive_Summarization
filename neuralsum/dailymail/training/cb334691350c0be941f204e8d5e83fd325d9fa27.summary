by @entity0 published : 20:32 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 07:55 est , 18 november 2013 help ? residents indicated they will call on their former neighbours , @entity3 , to fight fracking no sooner do i reveal that prince @entity6 is pining for a quiet refuge for his family on @entity9 than i discover he is in danger of being dragged into a row there over mineral and mining rights — and possibly fracking			1
it follows letters sent to 4,000 residents over manorial rights to the island , which were bought by a former policeman more than 20 years ago			1
@entity21 , 67 , bought rights covering 10,350 acres of @entity9 where @entity6 enjoyed his first two years of married life with @entity24 while working as a search and rescue helicopter pilot			1
but now the @entity26 has written to homeowners there , alerting them to the registration of the manorial title which , apparently , gives its owner interest in mineral and mining concerns			0
since this has never happened before , locals are worried , not least because they fear these might involve fracking			2
@entity38 says : ‘ it may be that @entity6 can help us in this			0
’ only last week there was a ‘ peasants ’ revolt ’ after the @entity44 , the former @entity46 leader in the @entity47 , sent a letter to homeowners in @entity50 claiming his rights in respect of ‘ mines and minerals ’ beneath their homes			0
in @entity59 , politicians have asked first minister @entity60 to end these ancient rights , which are often bought by wealthy eccentrics to give themselves a decorative lord of the manor title			2
the title for the @entity65 in @entity9 was bought in 1992			1
‘ i was at a property auction in @entity68 and by chance the title came up , ’ says @entity21 , who theoretically could call himself lord @entity66			2
‘ i bought it with no research purely for a commercial reason , which fell through			0
under attack ? @entity21 , who owns the 10,350 acres covering the royal home , has rights to mine neighbourly : the couple had a strong relationship with the community			1
here @entity24 is pictured accepting gifts ‘ i regarded it as worthless until the government , in recognising mineral values as a result of fracking , appear to have decided to put all the manorial titles in order and insisted they be registered			0
’ he says he is £ 40,000 out of pocket ‘ for something i bought on chance ’			0
@entity21 adds : ‘ i have spoken to some locals and told them i am happy to sell back the title to residents , some of whom are elderly and very distressed			1
‘ i would do this at a nominal figure if they joined together			0

royal couple *'s* @entity9 neighbours *warned* *landowner* has mining rights
@entity21 , 67 , bought the land and the power to frack if he wishes
worried locals hope the @entity112 can ' help us in this '
