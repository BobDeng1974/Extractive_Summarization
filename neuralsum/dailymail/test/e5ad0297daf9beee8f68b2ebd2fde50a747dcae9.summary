@entity0 has snatched two chocolate fingers from its famous packs – reducing the number to 22			2
the move is the latest evidence of how the nation ’s favourite brands and supermarkets are cutting back on pack sizes without a corresponding cut in prices			0
the ploy means shoppers are being subject to stealth price rises in what economists have dubbed ‘ shrinkflation ’			1
going down : @entity0 has snatched two chocolate fingers from its famous packs – reducing the number to 22 now 114 grams : @entity0 chocolate fingers have come down by 11g - the equivalent of two chocolate fingers in most cases , the price remains the same when the amount in the pack is cut , however in some rare examples the change comes with a price rise			1
packs of @entity0 chocolate fingers have come down by 11 grams – the equivalent of two chocolate fingers – to a weight of 114g			1
while the popular biscuits carry the @entity0 brand , they are actually made under licence by another manufacturer , @entity35 , which is responsible for the changes			1
@entity37 ’s said it did reduce the wholesale price of the packs to supermarkets to reflect the lower weight , but it had no say over whether this was passed this on to customers			1
the price at @entity48 has risen from £ 1 to £ 1.50 over the past year , however it has come down from £ 1 to 80p at @entity49 , according to figures from the @entity52 website			1
last month , the @entity53 revealed how the makers of @entity55 have reduced the amount of tea in its teabags – cutting the weight of a box of 80 by the equivalent of six teabags from the archive : boxes of @entity65 weighed 150g when this photograph was taken in march 2002 makers : the popular biscuits are made under licence by another manufacturer , @entity35 , which is responsible for the changes			1
its head office is pictured ( above ) in @entity73 , @entity74 we also detailed how the @entity76 is less chunky than it used to be after it was reduced in weight from 48g to 40g			2
when challenged , the manufacturer , @entity80 , claimed this was partly because of rising costs and partly because of its desire to help customers lose weight as its contribution to the government ’s anti-obesity campaign			1
in the news : the makers of @entity55 have reduced the amount of tea in its teabags – cutting the weight of a box of 80 by the equivalent of six teabags @entity49 reduced the size of cartons of pasta sauce , such as @entity101 , from 375g to 350g yet the price remained the same and it was still promoted as serving two people			1
@entity104 cut the size of its tins of @entity108 from 130g to 120g , but again there has been no corresponding fall in the price			2
@entity0 has something of a track record for shrinking packs in a move that protects its profits			2
it famously cut back on the number of crème eggs in its multi-packs ahead of @entity120 from five to six			0
before @entity121 , @entity37 ’s reduced its £ 5 @entity123 biscuits from 380g to 335g			1
in 2011 , @entity0 reduced the size of the 140g bar of @entity126 to 120g , so losing the equivalent of two chunks			0
it then cut the size of its traditional circular @entity130 tins from 975g to 850g – effectively snatching away 11 of the chocolate favourites			2
the firm was taken over by @entity133 of the @entity134 in 2010 in a deal worth £ 11.5billion , which has come under fire for a series of cost cutting measures that have undermined the historic @entity140 brand			0
the firm ’s @entity134 bosses have never been forgiven for reneging on a promise to keep open a @entity0 factory at @entity145 , near @entity146 , when it took over the company			0
they have also come under fire for shifting large parts of their chocolate production to cheaper facilities in @entity154			0
no corresponding fall in the price : @entity104 cut the size of its tins of @entity108 from 130g to 120g which ? recently highlighted a number of big brands that have been shrunk , such loaves of @entity162 ‘ @entity163 ’ bread are down from 800g to 750g ; @entity165 mixed vegetables down from 750g to 690g ; @entity168 ’s @entity167 are 50g lighter at 700g ; and @entity169 is down 20g to 180g			0
the executive director at which ? , @entity170 , said : ‘ shrinking products can be a sneaky way of putting up costs for consumers because pack sizes shrink but the prices do n’t			0
‘ it ’s now time for action on dodgy pricing practices that stops people from easily comparing products to find the cheapest			0
’ the @entity182 said : ‘ food and drink pricing always reflects the economic climate of the day , whether that ’s the impact of changing utility prices or ingredient costs which can be volatile			0
‘ businesses seek to offset these costs wherever possible through improvements in efficiency and productivity , but these actions can only go so far and in some cases companies will reduce the pack size rather than increasing the price for consumers			0
’ @entity37 ’s confirmed the reduction in the pack size and insisted the chocolate fingers remain good value .			2

packs of @entity65 have come down by 11 grams to weight of 114g
popular biscuits made under licence by another manufacturer , @entity37 **'s**
@entity48 **'s** price up from £ 1 to £ 1.50 in a year , but down to 80p at @entity49
