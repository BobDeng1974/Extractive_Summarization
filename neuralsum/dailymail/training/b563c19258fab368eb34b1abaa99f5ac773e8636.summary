humans have long been blamed for hunting the @entity2 mastodon - an ancient relative of the elephant - to extinction			1
but new radiocarbon dating of @entity2 fossils suggests that the animals became extinct before humans colonised the region			1
experts are still not absolutely certain why the animals died out , but now think that changing habitats from forests to tundra could have played a role			1
while it was traditionally thought that mastodons ( illustrated ) roamed areas in the @entity18 and @entity19 when it was covered with ice caps , scientists now think that that the area was only temporarily home to the animals when the climate was warm			1
they also disappeared before humans colonised the region it was popularly thought that mastodons lived in the @entity18 and @entity19 when the area was covered by ice caps			1
but , that view is at odds with what scientists currently know about the massive animals ’ preferred habitat of forests and wetlands abundant with leafy food			2
to examine the mismatch , an international team of researchers carbon dated fossils and now believe that the @entity18 and @entity19 were only temporary homes to mastodons when the climate was warm			1
the new findings , published in the journal @entity49 , indicate that mastodons suffered local extinction several tens of millennia before either human colonisation - the earliest estimate of which is between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago			0
new radiocarbon dating of @entity2 mastodon fossils suggests that the animals became extinct before human colonisation of @entity2			1
the researchers dated a collection of 36 fossil teeth ( pictured ) just as with the dinosaurs , scientists are not certain exactly why mastodons became extinct			0
but new data suggests that mastodons became extinct in pockets of eastern @entity69 around 75,000 years ago , following a habitat change from forest to tundra			2
mastodons occupied high latitudes between 125,000 and 75,000 years ago when it was covered with forests			0
but ecological changes led to habitat loss and population collapse			0
after this , mastodons were limited to areas south of the continental ice sheets where they suffered complete extinction over 10,000 years before the first humans crossed the @entity86 - or the onset of @entity89 climate changes			1
the study says that local extinction of mastodons were ' independent ; of their later extinction south of the ice			2
they also hint that the creatures died out before the onset of climate changes at the end of the ice age about 10,000 years ago , when they were among 70 species of mammals to disappear completely in @entity2			2
@entity103 , a curator in the @entity104 at the @entity105 , said : ‘ scientists have been trying to piece together information on these extinctions for decades			0
‘ was it the result of over-hunting by early people in @entity2 ? was it the rapid global warming at the end of the ice age ? ‘ did all of these big mammals go out in one dramatic die - off , or were they paced over time and due to a complex set of factors ? ’ over the course of the late @entity89 era , between about 10,000 and 125,000 years ago , the @entity2 mastodon ( @entity122 ) became widespread and occupied many parts of continental @entity2			0
@entity126 , a palaeontologist in the @entity127 , said : ‘ @entity122 teeth were effective at stripping and crushing twigs , leaves , and stems from shrubs and trees			0
‘ so it would seem unlikely that they were able to survive in the ice - covered regions of @entity135 and @entity136 during the last full - glacial period , as previous fossil dating has suggested			0
' the researchers used two different types of precise radiocarbon dating on a collection of 36 fossil teeth and bones of @entity2 mastodons from @entity135 and @entity136 - the region known as eastern @entity69			1
the dating methods , performed at @entity148 and the @entity149 , were designed to only target material from bone collagen			0
over the course of the late @entity89 era , between about 10,000 and 125,000 years ago , the @entity2 mastodon ( @entity122 ) which is shown in this illustration alongside other large furry beasts , became widespread , and occupied many parts of continental @entity2 all of the fossils were found to be older than previously thought , with most surpassing 50,000 years , which is the effective limit of radiocarbon dating			1
when taking mastodon habitat preferences and other ecological and geological information into account , the experts believe that mastodons probably only lived in the @entity18 and @entity19 for a limited time around 125,000 years ago , when forests and wetlands were established and the temperatures were as warm as they are today			1
mr @entity126 added : ‘ the residency of mastodons in the north did not last long			0
‘ the return to cold , dry glacial conditions along with the advance of continental glaciers around 75,000 years ago effectively wiped out their habitats			0
‘ @entity122 disappeared from @entity69 , and their populations became displaced to areas much farther to the south , where they ultimately suffered complete extinction about 10,000 years ago			0
’ the new report suggests that humans could not have been involved in the local extinction of mastodons in the north 75,000 years ago as they had not yet crossed the @entity182 from @entity183			2
the researchers dated a collection of 36 fossil teeth and bones of @entity2 mastodons from @entity135 and @entity136 - the region known as eastern @entity69			2

radiocarbon dating of @entity2 fossils suggests mastodons died out before humans could hunt them to extinction , as previously thought
experts are still not certain why the animals died out , but now think that changing habitats from forests to tundra could have played a role
@entity18 and @entity19 were only temporary homes to mastodons when the climate was warm , according to the new international study
