@entity1 chief executive @entity0 today revealed a £ 200 million scheme aimed at providing better care for the most vulnerable patients elderly and vulnerable patients will be offered longer gp appointments – including at weekends – in an attempt to reduce the chances of them ending up in hospital			1
they will have 30 - minute in - depth appointments with a family doctor in the hope that any underlying problems will be picked up before they require emergency admission			2
as part of a £ 200million scheme aimed at providing better care for the most vulnerable , some patients will also undergo consultations with @entity22 nurses via webcams to establish whether it is really necessary for them to go to casualty			1
@entity0 , the @entity1 ’s chief executive , yesterday announced the pilot scheme , which will be rolled out in 29 areas covering a total of five million patients			1
it is hoped the scheme will gradually expand across @entity32 with the aim of treating more patients at home , or at their gp surgery , rather than in hospital			1
the idea is to bring together hospitals , gps , community services and care homes to provide more joined - up care			2
mr @entity0 said the set - up of the @entity1 is too ‘ fragmented ’ , meaning patients are passed ‘ from pillar to post ’			1
specialist doctors , gps , nurses and physiotherapists do not work closely together nor spend enough time on preventative care , trying to avoid patients ’ conditions deteriorating			2
the present system also means that patients with several long - term conditions may have to go to a different hospital outpatient clinic 20 or so miles away , several times a month			0
in an interview for @entity60 ’s @entity62 programme , he said : ‘ in @entity32 we ’ve got a growing population and an ageing population and one of the big tests is can we provide compassionate , high - quality care for older people who have several different health problems at once			0
‘ too many parts of the service are quite fragmented			0
increasingly that ’s a problem			0
people are n’t getting preventative care they need			0
often people are being passed from pillar to post , or ending up in accident and emergency departments when they could have avoided it			0
’ eventually , mr @entity0 wants many of the complex procedures provided by hospitals to be routinely available at @entity82 a few miles from patients ’ homes			1
each area involved in this first phase of the scheme offers slightly different services depending on the needs of the population			0
in @entity93 , @entity94 , patients in care homes will be offered consultations via webcams with nurses in @entity22 units at any time of the day and night			1
if they suffer a fall , rather than calling an ambulance , staff at the care home will set up the internet consultation with a nurse at the hospital			1
the nurse will then liaise with a senior doctor and decide if the patient needs to come to @entity22 immediately or can wait for a @entity110 home visit			2
in @entity112 , the 7 per cent of patients deemed to be the most vulnerable will be offered 30 - minute appointments with their gp rather than the standard ten minutes			2
in @entity94 , patients in care homes will be offered consultations via webcams with medics working in @entity22 units at any time of the day or night , as part of the trial scheme announced today these patients may have several long - term conditions such as dementia , diabetes and heart disease and doctors will use the time to make more thorough assessments			1
in @entity130 , patients are being offered gp appointments at the weekend to prevent them going to casualty			0
surgeries will form local groups and ensure that at least one is open every saturday and sunday			0
although the appointments will be offered to all patients , they will most benefit the elderly and those with underlying conditions who see their doctor more often .			0

@entity0 , @entity1 chief executive , announced £ 200 million scheme
aimed at providing better care for the most vulnerable patients
hope it will stop patients *unnecessarily* ending up in hospital @entity22 units
complex procedures will be carried out at gp surgeries instead of hospital
care home patients will be able to have web cam consultations with @entity22
most vulnerable will be given 30 minutes instead of 10 with their gps
