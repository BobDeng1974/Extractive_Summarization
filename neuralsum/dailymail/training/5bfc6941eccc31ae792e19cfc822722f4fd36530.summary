by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 's week is going from bad to worse			2
first he was dumped from the @entity4 as @entity5 , then he lost his first vote in his new role as government chief whip			1
now it has emerged he became trapped in a toilet in the @entity11 and nearly missed another key vote in the @entity13			2
@entity2 was ousted as @entity5 in the reshuffle , to the delight of teaching unions , but his new job as chief whip does not seem to be going according to plan mr @entity2 ’s sudden departure from the @entity23 was one of the big shocks of the reshuffle , in which mr @entity20 promoted several women and @entity27			1
his demotion to chief whip , without a major department , leaves him outside the @entity4 and taking a £ 36,000 pay cut			2
as chief whip , mr @entity2 is charged with ensuring @entity34 mps turn up to vote on legislation			1
but on his first day in the job , he suffered a defeat over controversial plans for the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) to audit @entity41 ’s manifesto			0
in the @entity13 today it was claimed his attempt to make a good impression in the new job were put at risk after becoming stuck in a toilet			0
@entity48 , @entity41 's @entity13 leader , told @entity33 : ' i 'd like to welcome mr @entity2 ... he has n't had the most auspicious of starts			1
' yesterday , he not only lost his first vote but he managed to get stuck in the toilet in the wrong lobby and he nearly broke his own whip			2
' we know all about the former education secretary 's love of free schools			0
independent of any central authority - i wonder if he is keen to allow the emergence of lots of free @entity34 mps who do n't have to submit to his authority			0
' mr @entity2 ran into trouble as mps were preparing to vote on a @entity41 plan to have their manifesto audited by the @entity39 @entity68 , who quit as foreign secretary to become leader of the @entity13 , insisted : ' you made fun of what he was doing yesterday - knowledge of who is in the toilets in whatever lobby is a very important piece of information for any chief whip			1
' i take this as evidence he was carrying out his duties very assiduously			0
' the first vote of his tenure as chief whip came as @entity41 mp @entity87 launched a backbench bill to enshrine the plans into law , but they are opposed by the government			1
in a parliamentary ambush , @entity33 called both aye and no when asked to agree it to trigger a vote			0
with most @entity34 and @entity97 already heading to lunch after prime minister ’s questions , @entity41 won by 203 votes to 16			1
the vote is not binding , and the bill stands no chance of becoming law , but losing a vote within hours of taking the job is embarrassing for mr @entity2			0
earlier he was mocked in the @entity13 , as @entity41 leader @entity108 asked mr @entity20 : ‘ we have always said we will support the government when they do the right thing - so can i join thousands of parents across the country in congratulating you on getting rid of the education secretary ? ' why did you demote him ? ’ mr @entity20 hit back : ' let me tell you what the former education secretary achieved			2
a record number of academies , new free schools , standards rising across the country , and reforms that will endure			0
' but is n’t it extraordinary ... on a day of a record increase in the numbers at work in our country , you will do anything not to talk about economic recovery , deficit falling , economy growing , numbers in work rising - and i ’m not surprised you do n’t want to talk about people in work , your own job looks a bit shaky			0
' labour leader @entity108 yesterday mocked mr @entity2 , as he sat on the front bench next to @entity68 , @entity141 and @entity20 during @entity142 mr @entity20 heaped praise on mr @entity2 's record on academies , free schools and raising standards playing down his surprise shift yesterday , mr @entity2 said : ‘ demotion , emotion , promotion , locomotion , i do n't know how you would describe this move , though move it is , all i would say is that it 's a privilege to serve			1
’ but his removal as the face of the government ’s education reforms came after polls showed he was toxic for teachers – and voters			1
a new @entity167 / @entity166 survey yesterday showed just 22 per cent of voters say they like him , half the 44 per cent who like mr @entity20			2
a huge 58 per cent said they like @entity170			0
mr @entity2 has previously been tipped as a future @entity34 leadership candidate but the poll showed just 11 per cent of people think he has what it takes to be a good prime minister			1
almost a third ( 32 per cent ) backed mr @entity170 as a pm , followed by 30 per cent for @entity177 and 18 per cent who thought @entity179 has what it takes .			0

@entity2 was demoted to chief whip in @entity20 's *dramatic* reshuffle
*gloating* teachers *celebrated* the sudden demise of their @entity34 *nemesis*
*strategists* feared his ' toxic ' *reputation* was *damaging* the education reforms
@entity41 ambush him with surprise *commons* vote , and win by 203 to 16
as mps *walked* through the voting lobbies , he was trapped in a toilet
poll shows just 22 **%** of voters like him and 11 **%** think he would be a good pm
