@entity5 said monday that the @entity16 had informed the rating agency that it intends to file a civil lawsuit focusing on @entity5 's ratings of mortgage debt in 2007			1
the action does not involve any criminal allegations			2

but that argument has n't always succeeded in cases involving investments like those in the expected @entity5 suit , according to research by the @entity95 , a consulting firm			2
that 's because those ratings were n't published widely , as most bond ratings are			2
as a result , several courts have ruled that those ratings do not enjoy free - speech protection			0
