patients who have had a ‘ fair innings ’ could be denied life - saving drugs under proposed health reforms			1
the plans would mean experts taking into account whether there is a ‘ wider societal benefit ’ to giving a patient crucial medicines			1
the @entity12 rationing body , @entity13 , fears the @entity15 proposals could see younger people deemed a higher priority for drug treatments because they have more years ahead of them – potentially contributing more to the economy – than the elderly			1
controversial : the @entity12 rationing body , @entity13 , fears the @entity15 proposals could see younger people deemed a higher priority for drug treatments ( file picture ) doctors , mps and campaigners last night condemned the plans as ‘ barking mad ’			1
the move will also fuel fears that the elderly are receiving a worse deal from the health service than the young			1
cancer charities have already warned that ‘ cruel restrictions ’ mean older patients have been denied medical treatment , regardless of a proper assessment of their fitness levels and how likely they could benefit from treatment			1
sir @entity41 , the head of the @entity13 , said he was concerned about the new rules and feared they would lead to older patients being penalised in a ‘ hard - nosed ’ and ‘ crude ’ economic approach			1
concern : sir @entity41 , the head of the @entity13 , said he feared the rules would lead to older patients being penalised the reforms , which are being consulted on , would see new drugs assessed for the first time based partly on whether they would benefit society as a whole – not just the patient			0
for example , a drug that helped people to live longer in an expensive care home , or on welfare , might have a ‘ negative ’ social value not outweighed by the benefit to the individual , because such patients take more from society than they can put back			1
sir @entity41 said : ‘ there are lots of people who adopt the fair - innings approach : “ you ’ve had 70 years of life – you ’ve got to accept society is going to bias its investments in younger people			2
” there are people who subscribe to that , but it ’s not something we feel comfortable with			0
’ he said an initial assessment by @entity13 suggested that accounting for ‘ wider societal benefit ’ would inevitably tilt funding away from the old because younger patients had more to gain from treatment and more to give back			1
he added : ‘ we ’re really concerned that we do n’t send out a message that we value life less when you ’re 70 than when you ’re 20			0
’ @entity91 , chief executive of @entity92 , said : ‘ the @entity93 has some of the worst cancer survival rates in @entity95 and they are especially bad for older people			1
@entity98 strongly recommends against any action which could make this worse			0
the @entity13 board is right to reject the @entity15 ’s proposal			0
’ @entity103 , @entity105 mp and co-chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on ageing and older people , said any new rules on societal benefit would be ‘ absolutely wrong ’			1
‘ age should n’t come into it , ’ she said			1
‘ it ’s about you as an individual and what drugs work for you			0
you can not decide from someone ’s age , their ability to benefit from treatment			0
it ’s about them as an individual			0
’ priorities : the move will also fuel fears that the elderly are receiving a worse deal from the health service than the young ( file picture ) under the current system , @entity13 determines the cost of a new treatment by working out how much it improves and extends a person ’s life compared to existing treatments			1
it uses a formula known as ‘ quality adjusted life year ’ or @entity139			2
one @entity139 equals one year of perfect health , or two years of 50 per cent perfect health or four years of 25 per cent perfect health			0
generally , if the cost per @entity139 is below £ 20,000 , the treatment is deemed cost effective and approved			0
if it falls between £ 20,000 and £ 30,000 , @entity13 needs ‘ persuasion ’ to give it the go - ahead			2
if the cost is more than £ 30,000 , the drug is not normally approved			0
@entity150 , a @entity105 member of the health select committee , said : ‘ i am sure that [ restricting drugs to older people ] is not the intention of the rules			2
if it is , it would be barking mad			1
clearly people who have paid into the @entity12 should receive the support they need through their entire lives , including in retirement			2
’ @entity161 , a former adviser to the @entity162 on older people , said it was ‘ very frightening ’ that such a model was being considered			2
‘ it is quite orwellian that it is being said that if you ’re no longer fit for work , you are n’t owed anything by society , ’ she said			2
‘ it is wrong to say older people do not contribute to society			0
they do so much voluntarily for their local community and for their families through free childcare for grandchildren			0
all this saves us billions of pounds			0
’ leading prostate cancer specialist professor @entity179 said @entity13 was an organisation ‘ not fit for purpose ’			2
he added : ‘ @entity13 has been the main brake on the availability of cancer drugs during the last decade and caused considerable distress and deaths based on an opaque and unscientific evaluation system			0
‘ we need transparency about how these decisions are made			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity15 said changing the rules would ensure good value for money – without penalising the elderly			2
he added : ‘ that ’s why we have asked @entity13 to look at the way drugs are assessed so that patients can get the treatments they need at the best value for the @entity12			1
‘ the allegation that older people will miss out is absolutely not true			0
’ @entity105 mp @entity103 said the rules would be ' absolutely wrong ' while @entity150 , a @entity105 member of the @entity203 said the plans were ' barking mad '			1

plans would consider ' wider societal benefits ' when giving out medicines
@entity12 body fears the proposals would mean the young are a ' higher priority '
prompted fears the elderly are *receieving* a worse deal from health service
doctors , mps and campaigners condemned the plans as ‘ barking mad ’
