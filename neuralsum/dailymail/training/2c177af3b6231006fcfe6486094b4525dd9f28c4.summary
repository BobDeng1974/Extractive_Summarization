by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 5 december 2012 two thieves who stole a ' priceless ' artwork by the sculptor @entity3 and sold it at a scrapyard for £ 46 have each been jailed for a year			1
@entity5 , 22 , and 19 - year - old @entity6 stole the @entity7 - believed to be worth around half a million pounds - from the grounds of the @entity9 in @entity10			1
the pair returned to the artist 's former home four days later and tore another sculpture , known as @entity15 , from its bronze plinth before making off with the base , which was valued at £ 100,000			1
they sold it as scrap for £ 182.60			2
' selfish ' : @entity6 , 19 , and @entity5 , 22 , both from @entity21 , admitted stealing a @entity3 sculpture worth around £ 500,000 and selling it at a scrapyard for £ 46 @entity3 is widely regarded as one of the most important @entity26 artists of the @entity27 , and his creations have fetched millions at auction			1
neither of the men had any idea of the true value of what they had taken , @entity31 @entity30 heard			2
sentencing the pair today , judge @entity37 said : ' the value of @entity7 is put at something like half a million pounds , but the truth is it is actually priceless because it can not be replaced should it be lost			1
' these actions were utterly selfish thefts			0
you were stealing these items for a pittance as scrap regardless of any damage or impact your actions might have on others			0
' you took the risk of causing immense damage to the @entity9 and you were risking the permanent destruction of the items that , certainly in the case of @entity7 , are irreplaceable works of art , ' the judge added			0
stolen : @entity6 and @entity5 took @entity57 from the grounds of @entity3 's former home in @entity10 when the scrapdealer who had unwittingly bought the items saw an appeal for their safe return on the television programme @entity67 , he contacted police and returned both pieces before they were destroyed			1
@entity6 and @entity5 , both from @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity21 , pleaded guilty last month to stealing the 22 - inch tall @entity57 piece overnight on july 10			1
they also admitted returning to steal the plinth from another piece between july 15 and 16			2
' irreplaceable ' : the artist @entity3 , who died in 1986 , pictured with @entity7 the cost of repairing the damage to the artwork the pair tore from the bronze plinth , together with other necessary security works , is estimated at £ 13,000 , the court heard			1
@entity84 , prosecuting , added that the thefts had damaged the @entity9 's standing in the international art world			2
' perhaps of more significance to the members of the foundation is that sculptures had to be taken from public view , taken from access , ' he said			0
' @entity90 is concerned that this weakens its position in the international market			0
' if the reputation is that they can not look after their own works , why would it be safe for them to look after other works			0
' @entity3 is an artist who stipulated that no further works should be made from the casts of his works , so if they disappear and are melted down , that is it , ' he added			0
@entity109 , in mitigation for @entity5 , said the 22 year old ' wishes to apologise ' for the thefts			2
he said : ' they decided to take the metal from that location because they had been told it was a target for theft			0
it was never their intention to take it for its artistic value			0
@entity120 , in mitigation for @entity6 , said his client was ' drifting into delinquency ' and had been hit hard by his girlfriend ’s miscarriage , which happened shortly before the theft			0
@entity6 and @entity5 were each given a 12 month jail term , which @entity6 will serve in a young offenders ' institution .			1
