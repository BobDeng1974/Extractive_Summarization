by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 20:22 est , 6 september 2013 some brands of butter and supposedly ‘ healthy ’ spreads contain almost as much salt as seawater , a study shows			1
because of its high saturated fat content , butter is associated with health risks such as weight gain , clogged arteries and heart disease			2
however , research by @entity14 on @entity15 ( cash ) , suggests the salt content of some spreads is also a concern			1
@entity19 contains 2.5g of salt per 100g which makes it as salty as seawater seven in ten salted butters would receive a red traffic light label for salt under guidelines drawn up by the @entity26 ( @entity26 )			1
researchers found that fewer than four in ten spreads meet the @entity29 ’s 2012 salt reduction targets			1
the study warned that labels can be confusing			0
it pointed to @entity34 , which is described as ‘ slightly salted ’ , but contains more than the chain ’s @entity35			1
the study found that ‘ low fat ’ spreads can be higher in salt than the full fat versions , while one was as salty as some oceans			1
some of the saltiest butters available are @entity45 ( 2g salt per 100g ) , @entity47 ( 1.9g salt per 100g ) and @entity49 ( 1.7g salt per 100g ) the saltiest butter was found to be @entity45 at 2g of salt per 100g , ahead of @entity47 at 1.9g			1
among margarines and spreads , the highest level was in @entity19 spread at 2.5g salt per 100g – seawater is typically between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent salt			1
@entity59 , campaign manager at @entity60 , warned : ‘ just one slice of buttered toast can contain more salt than a packet of crisps			2
’ consumers generally eat spreads in relatively small amounts but their salt intake is boosted by eating processed foods such as bread and breakfast cereals			2
high salt intake poses few health problems in the short term			0
but continued high consumption is linked to raised blood pressure and the greater risk of a stroke and early death			0
@entity81 routinely consume more than the recommended maximum of 6g of salt a day for adults , resulting in an extra 70,000 heart attacks and strokes each year			0
@entity87 , chairman of @entity60 and professor of cardiovascular medicine at the @entity89 , said : ‘ it is a national scandal that there is still so much unnecessary salt in our food			0
‘ for every one gramme reduction in salt intake , we can prevent 12,000 heart attacks , strokes and heart failures , half of which would have been fatal			0
‘ it is vital that the @entity29 ensures that manufacturers reduce the salt in these products immediately			1
’ @entity106 , senior dietician at the @entity107 , said : ‘ shoppers clearly have to look twice when making the switch from butter to unsaturated spread			1
‘ manufacturers and supermarkets must cut back on the salt in their products so there is one less thing for shoppers to worry about			0
’ ‘ with so many varieties on offer , picking a healthy spread is confusing enough for consumers			0
‘ manufactures and supermarkets must cut back on the salt in their products so there is one less thing for shoppers to worry about			0
’ @entity60 has offered suggestions about how people can reduce their salt intake			0
it suggests that people opt for unsalted spreads and butters , that they think twice about diet spreads with less fat as they may contain more salt , that people reduce their butter and spread portions , and that people use olive oil when cooking instead of butter			2
graphic shows the amount of salt ( in grams ) in the saltiest butter and margarine on sale in supermarkets			2

@entity19 contains 2.5g of salt per 100g
this is the same as the salt content of the @entity155
just 8 **%** of butter and margarine meet @entity29 ’s @entity159
70 **%** of butters get a ‘ red traffic light ’ for salt as they contain more than 1.5g per 100g
