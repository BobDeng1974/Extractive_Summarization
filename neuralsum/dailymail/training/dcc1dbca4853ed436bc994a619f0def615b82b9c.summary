by @entity0 children should not be ordered to stand in naughty corners at school because it 's an abuse of their human rights , according to academics at the @entity7			1
the common practise of excluding disruptive students from classrooms , which has been used by 85 percent of teachers in @entity12 in the last week , has also been called into question by professors at the @entity7 's @entity15			1
dr @entity16 believes that removing children from classrooms because they are not behaving ' may be a breaching of their rights '			1
she told @entity20 that the practice is ' not effective and is often used on kids who are already disengaged '			0
excluded : dr @entity16 believes that removing children from classrooms and making them stand in naughty corners because they are not behaving ' may be a breaching of their rights ' she said there are two human rights in particular that could be affected by placing children on time out - the right to dignity and the right to education			1
dr @entity16 is holding a conference , called the @entity34 in @entity36 @entity35 on 16 july , in which academics will come together to challenge the way teachers currently handle behaviour in classrooms with a specific focus on human rights			1
dr @entity45 of @entity12 is organising a conference on how teachers handle ' naughty ' students in schools she explained : ' its intention is to be a bit provocative and ask the tough questions			1
we have to rethink things ' ' one of the most common practices schools use is the step system , ' dr @entity16 said			1
the step system involves warnings against misbehaving children which escalates into time out if they do n't respond			1
' increasingly we 're taking kids from the learning environment			0
then they disengage and do n't have a clue what is happening ... it 's exacerbating the problem , ' she explained			2
dr @entity16 said she is not saying to ban things like naughty corners but says teachers should n't ' rely on them ' as the first solution to an unruly child as they do not fix the problem			1
she recommends teachers use a positive approach and said that the university 's research has shown the best performing schools use engaged learning			1
' it 's all about prevention and how do we get the child to engage			2
we 're not saying what schools are doing is n't great work , ' she said			2
asked how she would handle a child who is screaming and shouting in the classroom she said she would try to ' diffuse the situation and get back on task			0
' ' you need to question is it because a child has something happen at home ? do they have angers issues ? or maybe the teacher needs to work with the whole group			0
' the @entity102 consists of 54 articles and is guided by four fundamental principles			0
it was adopted by the @entity106 in 1989 and was ratified by @entity12 in december 1990 but has not yet been incorporated into @entity36 law			2
the four key principles are : 1			0
@entity109 , everywhere : children should neither benefit nor suffer because of their race , colour , gender , language , religion , national , social or ethnic origin , or because of any political or other opinion ; because of their caste , property or birth status ; or because they are disabled.2			2
the @entity122 : laws and actions affecting children should put their best interests first and benefit them in the best possible way.3			0
@entity126 , development and protection : the authorities in each country must protect children and help ensure their full development — physically , spiritually , morally and socially.4			0
a voice : children have a right to have their say in decisions that affect them and to have their opinions taken into account			0
the focus on children 's rights at the conference comes comes as the @entity102 celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2014			1
@entity12 's government has committed to making sure every child in @entity12 has every right under each of 54 articles in the @entity102 and must report every five years to the @entity145 highlighting what they are doing to ensure children 's rights are being met			1
an event listing for the conference on the @entity7 's website said : ' this conference aims to challenge dominant thinking about behaviour and will examine approaches that respect students ' human dignity , treat students fairly rather than equally , and promote humanistic and inclusive policies and practices related to behaviour			1
' the conference aims to be a ' catalyst for collaboration ' between groups that have an interest in behaviour in schools			2
professor @entity169 , who will also speak at the conference , told @entity171 that ' some of the practices undertaken in schools from a conservative approach privilege the rights of the group over the rights of the individual '			1
professor @entity169 explained that he wants teachers to treat students ' fairly '			2
' you build relationships with kids , you treat them fairly , you talk to them a lot , you do n’t cause an escalation over minor things ( and ) you negotiate with them , ' he said			0
this is n't the first time the practise of putting children in a ' naughty corner ' has been called into question			0
in 2011 , a @entity199 education and parenting consultant claimed naughty corners and time out in bedrooms ' shame ' and ' humiliate ' children			0
@entity205 recommends parents and teachers let the child have quiet time to calm down rather than punishing them			0
' even when this strategy is framed as a request for children to " sit and think about what they have done and then apologise " , it is inappropriate			0
a child 's bedroom should be a safe happy place of relaxation , ' she told the @entity221			0
