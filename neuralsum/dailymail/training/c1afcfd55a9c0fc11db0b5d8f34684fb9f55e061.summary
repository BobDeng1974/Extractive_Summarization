by @entity0 published : 10:48 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 1 august 2013 live aid founder sir @entity1 is caught up in a row with his neighbour over plans for a garden gate linked to his 900 - year - old country estate			1
@entity8 wants to reinstate an old opening in the wall of the former rockstar 's mansion in @entity13 , but sir @entity1 says it is a security risk			1
ms @entity8 , 43 , says the gate will give her better access to the garden of her @entity20 - listed , end - terrace house which stands right next to sir @entity1 's land			1
but the ex-pop star is opposing her planning application and says putting a gate in his wall would allow people easy access to his home			2
row : sir @entity1 wants to stop his neighbour opening up an old gate ( circled ) linked to his property 's wall so she can get better access to her garden in his letter of objection , sir @entity1 , 61 , wrote : '' i oppose this application because permission will not be given to the applicant to undertake these changes to my property			1
' in addition , i will not allow any right of way over my land between the gateway and the rear garden			0
' i further object on grounds of loss of amenity			0
to open a ' gate ' at this point in the boundary wall of my property will be a tangible security risk to it			2
' during the three decades i have occupied the house it was only by reluctantly creating a fenced boundary onto @entity61 and by growing hedges [ ... ] that i have been able to finally stop repeated encroachments onto my grounds			0
' argument : sir @entity1 says he would not allow any right of way over his land at @entity69 in @entity13 , and argues that it will be unsecured if allowed ms @entity8 , 43 , wants to put the opening in an area where a gate previously existed before it was bricked over in the 1930s			1
she said : ' the land is not shared - it is my land			0
' i am proposing to re-instate a side access gate adjacent to my property to enable myself to have side access			0
' ms @entity8 ' cottage was once part of the @entity69 estate where sir @entity1 has lived for 30 years			1
aerial view : sir @entity1 's house is in red at the top of the picture and the gate would be in the circled area at the bottom villagers said they supported their famous neighbour 's opposition to the gate			1
@entity96 , 86 , said : ' in the past people have jumped over the wall into @entity1 's grounds			1
' if there is a gate directly into his land then there certainly would be a security risk for him			2
' there is no need to put the gate in			0
i can not understand why there is a problem with access to the cottage			0
' retired publican @entity113 , 66 , said ' @entity1 is n't usually up himself or anything like that			2
' he 's very approachable and does n't act like a superstar			0
he talks to people and is often seen walking around the town			0
' a decision on ms @entity8 ' application is due to be announced on august 22 .			2

@entity8 wants new entrance to her garden via sir @entity1 's wall
but the @entity129 founcer says the new gate would become a security issue
