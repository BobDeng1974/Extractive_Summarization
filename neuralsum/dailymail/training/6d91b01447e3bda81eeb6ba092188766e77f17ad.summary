the day will be forever etched into her memory - the moment @entity4 's youngest ever president was assassinated on the streets of @entity6 , @entity7			2
@entity8 and her friend had gone to the parade route with her new @entity12 camera , eager to take a snapshot when the president and @entity15 passed them in the motorcade			1
little did she know that she would capture the moment immediately before @entity19 fired the fatal shot that killed @entity21			1
tragic moment : @entity8 took this @entity12 photograph , showing the president and the @entity15 reacting after @entity21 had been hit in the throat			1
almost the instant after this photo was taken , @entity21 was hit in the head up close : @entity8 is seen in the @entity28 film , as she is in the blue raincoat taking a picture of the president and first lady in the foreground just as he was shot at first she did not know what was going on , thinking that the snap she heard was that of a firecracker			1
' that was my thought : " i saw his hair jump ! " but it was n't just his hair , it was part of his head , ' she told @entity47 on @entity48			0
' i heard @entity49 , " my @entity50 , he ’s been shot "			1
’ ms @entity8 was a 31 - year - old housewife at the time of the assassination			2
the @entity28 film - named after @entity28 , the man who captured @entity21 's assassination on a home camera - shows @entity8 standing in a blue raincoat next to her friend in a red raincoat on the grass between @entity60 and @entity61 as the president 's convertible drives by			1
what @entity8 did n't realize when she chose to wait for the motorcade was that her location was in line with the @entity68 , where shooter @entity19 was waiting on the sixth floor			2
then : @entity8 was rushed to a local newspaper office after a reporter saw she had taken a picture now : mrs @entity8 , 81 , sat down for an interview with the @entity48 and said that she believes there is ' more ' to be discovered about the true nature of the @entity21 assassination on their way : mrs @entity8 ( left ) and her friend ( right ) went to the parade together in matching raincoats ' i heard the shot , took the camera down , and i heard two more shots , ' she told the @entity48			1
' just pow , pow , pow			0
' in the hectic aftermath immediately following the shots , a local reporter approached ms @entity8 and accompanied her to his newspaper office so that they could take a look at the photo together as it developed			2
it shows @entity97 leaning in towards her husband as he appears to be falling back into the seat			0
' the though always comes back to me : i saw a man murdered right in front of my eyes			0
that thought is still present in my mind right now , ' she said			0
different angle : from where she was standing , ms @entity8 was closest to first lady @entity111 , and said that she could here her scream ' my @entity50 , he 's been shot ! ' orientation : ms @entity8 and her friend were standing on the grass between the point of impact and the location of @entity119 ( noted on this aerial photo as ' @entity121 ' )			1
other points marked are the @entity68 , where @entity19 was positioned , and th infamous ' grassy knoll ' she agreed to sell the original @entity12 through an auction house but it failed to meet its expected price of $ 50,000 to $ 75,000			2
ms @entity126 , who is now 81 - years - old , said she does not subscribe to any of the major conspiracy theories but many others actually used her photograph as part of their justification for their own versions of events - specifically the ' grassy knoll theory ' that suggests there was a second shooter			0
she said that she never ' delved ' into any of the different theories but continued to remain wary of the final conclusion that was drawn by the @entity140 , which in 1964 ruled that @entity19 had acted alone			0
' i do n’t think that i heard any more shots than three but so many of the things that i have heard makes me think that there 's a lot more to the story , ' she said			0

@entity8 took her @entity12 camera to the parade route and took a photo the moment before @entity21 was fatally shot in the head
she was so close enough to the convertible that she heard @entity49 scream : ' my @entity50 , he 's been shot ! '
