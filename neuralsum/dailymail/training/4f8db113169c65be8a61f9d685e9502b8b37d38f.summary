the difference 12 months makes			0
when @entity3 last visited @entity4 , his post-match debrief revolved around his frustrations that @entity6 lacked a top - class striker			1
he spoke about his side ’s evolving ‘ profile ’ , lamented the chances they had squandered in a 1 - 0 defeat and explained why it was the one area that was likely to hinder @entity6 ’s pursuit of honours			1
fast forward to the present and a £ 32million investment has transformed @entity3 ’s squad			1
goals after three games : @entity33 ( @entity6 ) 3 - @entity34 ( @entity35 ) 2 - @entity36 ( @entity37 ) 1 - @entity38 ( @entity6 ) 1 - @entity39 ( @entity40 ) 1 - @entity41 ( @entity40 ) @entity43 - @entity42 did score four in his first three games for @entity37 , but he had already been in the @entity25 for eight years			1
in @entity19 , @entity3 has found the missing link			2
if @entity19 arrived from @entity46 with some questions hanging over him , having seriously underwhelmed during @entity50 ’s wretched @entity49 campaign , he is swiftly providing emphatic answers that he is the real deal			1
his performance in a helter - skelter collision with @entity55 , one which finished with a score — 3 - 6 — more befitting a game of tennis , was everything you could ask for from a high - end forward : slick , strong , aggressive and clinical			2
‘ it ’s been nice to score goals but the most important thing is i help the team to win , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ hopefully that continues all season			2
we have had a great start but there is a long way to go			0
’ @entity19 tormented @entity55 ’s defence , driving them to distraction			1
there were some unedifying moments — his squabbles with @entity77 and @entity78 , for instance — but there was also undisputed class , like when he sidestepped his pursuers to finish the scoring late on			0
@entity3 , understandably , was keen to champion @entity19 ’s dazzling impact — to think selling @entity85 for £ 28million almost recouped the fee he spent on the 25 - year - old — but , inevitably , there was something else he wanted to say and his message was clear : @entity19 needs protection			1
‘ @entity19 is a mature guy , ’ @entity3 said			1
‘ he has played in some very big matches and comes from a situation where this is no pressure for him			0
roar : @entity19 tormented @entity55 ’s defence , driving them to distraction , and had spats with @entity77 caught : @entity19 created arguments with @entity77 and goalkeeper @entity78 but showed class at times grab : @entity3 , understandably , was keen to highlight champion @entity19 ’s dazzling impact on @entity6 words : @entity55 goalkeeper @entity78 grabs @entity19 by the scruff of the neck after the controversial celebration ‘ he comes to play football and to give a spectacle but people have been chasing cards for him like they did in this match and , in fact , the referees are moving in this direction , too , because he has had two yellow cards in three matches , which is hard to understand			1
‘ imagine the millions watching around the world and , because @entity55 players are chasing him to get cards , i take him off ? i do n’t think that is fair			1
‘ i do n’t think this is what the people want			2
i do n’t think this is what the @entity25 wants			2
so when people chase him for cards , give cards to these players			2
@entity126 , chased ! he has two yellow cards			0
he ’s scored four goals			2
he is one of , if not the best , player in the @entity25 in these three games			2
normally he has to get @entity132			0
but he has two yellow cards			0
’ sympathy for @entity19 was in short supply			0
he is not a shrinking violet and , when @entity55 pressed his buttons , he gave as good as he got , never shying away from the confrontation			0
@entity19 is a street - fighter and @entity3 may have to accept he will court trouble			1
‘ i ’ve been in the @entity142 game for almost 20 seasons and i know the football culture			0
with @entity50 and @entity145 , i know the players take time to adapt , ’ said @entity55 manager @entity140			1
exchange : @entity19 and @entity148 get involved in a heated debate during the controversial @entity6 win opener : @entity19 scored @entity6 's first goal after just 34 seconds at @entity4 on saturday evening ‘ but he needs to understand we are quite unique in our league : we are very honest and respectful			1
you do n’t see that sort of behaviour in our league ( @entity19 celebrated in front of @entity77 after the @entity55 defender ’s own goal )			1
‘ that ’s not a reflection of the class that he has			0
he ’s a top player and has had to fight for what he ’s got			0
it ’s a real shame when you ’ve got a childish reaction like that			0
’ after conceding 10 goals in the first three games , @entity140 has other things to worry about than @entity19 ’s behaviour but will take some solace that @entity55 wo n’t face a side of @entity6 ’s quality every week			1
‘ it was difficult for us to score away from home last season , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ but , in this game , we were brilliant in that aspect but were very bad defensively			0
we conceded too much and must be more solid from a defensive point of view , so we are far from perfect			0
' we have given people some nice feelings in these three matches			0
the @entity6 @entity186 have a feeling this team will be good in this competition all this season			2
but that is just feelings			0
we have a lot of work to do			0
we ’ve nine points from three games but so too do @entity197			0
’ save : @entity55 goalkeeper @entity78 sticks out his right leg to deny @entity19 yet another goal on saturday evening fallout : @entity6 boss @entity3 ( left ) defended @entity19 but @entity55 manager @entity140 was not happy			1

@entity19 *signed* for @entity6 for £ 32million from @entity46 and has had an instant impact under @entity3 in the @entity25
‘ it ’s been nice to score goals but the most important thing is i help the team to win . hopefully that continues all season , ' says @entity19
@entity3 : ‘ he comes to play football and to give a spectacle but people have been chasing cards for him like they did in this match ( against @entity55 ) '
@entity55 manager @entity140 says @entity19 ' needs to understand we are quite unique in our league - we are very honest and respectful '
