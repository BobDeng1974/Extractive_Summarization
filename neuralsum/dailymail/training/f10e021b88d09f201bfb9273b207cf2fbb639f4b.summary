at least one man spent the night sleeping outside of a @entity2 bookstore in order to meet @entity4 at a signing for her new memoir but he only got to spend five seconds with the former secretary of state			1
once the awaiting crowds were allowed inside the @entity10 in @entity11 , they were handed a list of rules that stipulated that she would not pose for photographs with them or personalizing their signed books			2
the event was held as a kick off effort for her new book , @entity22 , but apparently the buzz from a string of news interviews and personal appearances such this morning 's event at @entity10 are not helping a great deal			1
book trial : many have seen the release of her latest memoir and ensuing book tour as a preamble to a likely 2016 presidential run , though she says she has not made a decision about the race ( pictured tuesday at the @entity2 @entity10 ) on sale : all major bookstores are selling the 656 - page tome for 40 per cent off the sticker price , knocking it down to $ 21 from $ 35 a books a million store in @entity43 , @entity44 just outside of @entity45 has already marked the price of the tome down by 40 per cent for loyalty members and 30 per cent to the general public			1
@entity50 reporter @entity49 shared a picture via @entity52 that showed the markdown on the book , noting that a @entity56 manager said that it was ' very unusual ' to have a new book immediately marked off at more than 20 per cent			1
the manager said the sale ' really threw me '			0
they were not the only store to knock the price of mrs @entity4 's book down dramatically , as @entity65 is also selling the hardcover edition for $ 21 , which marks a 40 per cent cut to the sticker price of $ 35			1
even @entity69 and @entity70 was selling it at the same lowered price , and a spokeswoman from the bookstore told the @entity75 that the turnout did not stand out - even though there were a handful of die - hards who spent the night on the sidewalk to get a good spot			0
the spokeswoman said that the author of @entity85 and actor @entity84 drew similarly - sized crowds as well as @entity88 senator @entity87			1
get in line : the crowd wrapped around the block and a spokeswoman for the @entity10 said that it was about the same number of people who attended signings by @entity84 and @entity87 rallying support : the @entity100 political action committee has already raised millions in expectation of her run though she has repeatedly said that she will not have a firm answer until the end of the year that said , @entity108 and the @entity109 apparently drew bigger crowds when they had their own signings			2
@entity112 was one of the ones who stuck it out , however , and he is used to pulling all - nighters for authors he cares about			0
@entity120 spoke to the 41 - year - old @entity122 native who said that he has waited outside twice for two different signings by her husband , former president @entity126 , as well as the late @entity127 and all of the @entity129 releases			0
he , like many @entity126 supporters , knows full well that she has not officially announced her expected 2016 presidential run but mr @entity133 felt the urge to reiterate his support			0
' that 's what i 'm going to say to her if i get my five seconds as she 's signing the book , ' he told @entity120 reporter @entity142			2
' i 'm going to say that i know it 's really selfish , but we are selfish and we really need her to run			0
we do really need her to run			0

@entity65 , @entity148 and @entity56 are all selling the book with a sizable *discount*
the size of the crowd at her @entity2 book signing today was similar to the one that came for @entity85 author and @entity84
fans were given only ' five seconds ' with her and she *refused* to personalize her notes in the books or sign any other *memorabilia*
comes as the *launch* of a national book tour for her memoir ' @entity22 '
