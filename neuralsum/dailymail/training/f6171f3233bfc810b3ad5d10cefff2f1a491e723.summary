by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 19:07 est , 2 december 2013 breakthrough : the new test can distinguish between life - threatening tumours and less serious ones , allowing doctors to tailor treatment			1
file picture thousands of women could be spared unnecessary and invasive breast cancer treatment thanks to a test being developed by @entity13 scientists			1
the test , which could be available on the @entity15 within five years , can distinguish between life - threatening tumours and less serious ones			1
the technique is used for a type of tumour linked to breast cancer that affects 4,800 women a year			1
about half of patients with these tumours go on to develop breast cancer , which may later spread to other organs			1
but the other half have non-aggressive tumours that are n’t life - threatening			1
at present , doctors have no way of distinguishing between the tumours , so all women have surgery and most also have debilitating radiotherapy			1
this means about 2,400 a year are having operations needlessly , a fifth of whom will lose their entire breast			1
now researchers at @entity41 , @entity42 have discovered that women with aggressive tumours also have high levels of a certain molecule in the glands of breast tissue			2
they have developed a £ 200 test in which doctors check the levels of this molecule in a biopsy of the tumour through a microscope			2
those with high levels would be referred on to surgery and possibly radiotherapy , while those with lower levels would be advised to have regular check - ups			2
they believe that 2,400 women a year with this type of tumour – called @entity66 in @entity67 ( @entity66 ) – could be spared treatment			1
professor @entity69 , from the @entity70 at @entity41 , said : ‘ at the moment we treat everybody who has a diagnosis of @entity66 in exactly the same way , as though their disease is likely to progress			2
‘ they will have surgery and they may have chemotherapy and it ’s really quite distressing for women			2
‘ they are told , “ you have cancer ” – but it ’s not quite cancer – and some of them are also told , “ you need a mastectomy ”			2
‘ they find this very hard to understand and ultimately this disease may not have done any harm			2
’ just under 50,000 women develop breast cancer every year , making it by far the commonest form of the disease			1
it leads to 11,500 deaths annually presently all women with suspected breast cancer have a biopsy , in which a small sample of tumour is removed and sent away for further examinations			0
these let doctors know which type of cancer a woman has , and this determines her course of treatment			1
this new test would just be carried out at the same time as the existing ones , which is why it would be so @entity120 comparison , surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer costs between £ 3,500 and £ 6,600			0
breast cancer surgery is particularly upsetting for women – especially a mastectomy – as they can feel as if they are losing their femininity			0
around 70 per cent will have radiotherapy afterwards , which involves daily trips to the hospital for up to eight weeks and can lead to sickness , fatigue and pain			0
just under 50,000 women develop breast cancer every year , making it by far the commonest form of the disease			1
it leads to 11,500 deaths annually			0
baroness @entity138 , chief executive of the @entity139 , which funded the research , said it could be ' life - changing ' the researchers will now carry out thorough checks of the test on at least 600 women to ensure it properly distinguishes between the two types of tumours			0
if these go to plan , they hope the test will be available on the @entity15 in about five years			1
early trials of the test on 700 women have shown that , for those with @entity66 , it accurately diagnoses whether they have non-aggressive or aggressive breast cancer			0
baroness @entity138 , chief executive of the @entity139 , which funded the research , said : ‘ this research could be key to the hunt to develop a life - changing reliable prognostic test for women with @entity66			0
‘ such a test would mean women with @entity66 would finally be able to make informed decisions about their treatment			0
‘ they would no longer face the agonising choice between risking their breast cancer becoming invasive or facing treatment without knowing whether their @entity66 will become life - threatening or not			0
‘ a test wo n’t be available in the clinic overnight , but we ’re hopeful that ongoing research will allow this to happen in the future , which will signal a pivotal moment in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer			0
’ dr @entity180 , of the @entity181 , @entity182 , said : ‘ the exciting research makes significant steps forward in our understanding of the biology of @entity66 and its progression to invasive cancer			0
‘ these results , if validated by other research groups , could provide a new marker for identifying dcis that are more likely to progress to invasive disease , however more importantly may highlight a group of patients where no treatment is necessary			0
‘ this would be a major breakthrough in the management of @entity66 and although this research is not ready for clinical application yet it shows great promise for the future			0
’ but professor @entity204 , of the @entity205 in @entity206 , said : ‘ this is an interesting new scientific finding and could prove important in the future , but at the moment the results of the study need to be replicated by others , and so any potential prognostic uses and treatment related to this may be many years away			1

it could *prevent* around 2,400 woman a year from needless operations
@entity221 could be available through @entity15 in five years
