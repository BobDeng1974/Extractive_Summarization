security researchers have discovered a way to intercept a person 's fingerprints on a @entity4 running @entity5 4.4 and older fingerprint scanners are often touted as the future of security and an alternative to the notoriously flawed password			1
but experts have discovered they may not be as secure as first thought after a number of @entity5 devices , including @entity15 's @entity4 , were said to be potentially ' leaking ' fingerprints			1
the security researchers have found a way to intercept a person 's biometric data after it is captured by a built - in scanner , but before it becomes encrypted			1
@entity22 and @entity23 from security firm @entity24 are expected to discuss their findings at this week 's @entity27 conference in @entity28			0
the pair told @entity30 from @entity31 that the flaw lies in older versions of the @entity5 operating system , up to and including @entity5 4.4			1
subsequently , anyone running @entity5 5.0 or above are not at risk and the security experts are advising people on older models to update as soon as possible			1
the vulnerability means that a hacker can access the kernel , or core , of the @entity5 operating system			1
once inside they can monitor all data sent to and from the phone , as well as data recorded by the handset 's built - in sensors , including the fingerprint scanner			1
typically , when a fingerprint is scanned it is encrypted and separated from the rest of the device in a secure folder			1
hackers ca n't get access to this folder even with access to the kernel , but they can collect scans immediately from the fingerprint sensor before they reach this folder			1
in addition to using these fingerprints to access the phone , for example , they can be used to make payments with @entity68			1
when a fingerprint is scanned it is encrypted			1
hackers typically ca n't access this encrypted file , but the flaw allows them to collect scans from the sensor before being encrypted during tests , mr @entity22 and mr @entity23 confirmed the flaw was present on @entity4			1
they have not yet tested it on other @entity5 smartphones with built - in fingerprint scanners , including the @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 7			1
however , they believe the problem to be ' more widespread ' than the @entity4 and are planning to put this to the test			1
@entity24 's research is n't the first time the @entity4 's scanner has been exposed as vulnerable			1
in april last year a group of @entity102 hackers managed to spoof the scanner using a dummy print			1
@entity106 's @entity105 is n't without flaws either			0
it took hackers just two days and a small collection of everyday household items to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an @entity113 following its launch in 2013			1
@entity115 , based in @entity116 , took a high - resolution photograph of a fingerprint from the side of a glass			2
they then scanned it , before laser printing it onto a transparent sheet and covering it in woodglue			0
once the glue had dried , they peeled off the print copy and pressed it on the scanner			2
mr @entity22 and mr @entity23 said they have alerted @entity15 to the issue but not received an update			0
@entity15 told @entity136 ' it takes consumer privacy and data security very seriously ' and is currently investigating @entity24 ’s claims			2
security expert @entity141 said : ' it 's worth remembering that fingerprints are not secrets			0
' relying on your fingerprints to secure a device may be okay for casual security - but you should n't depend upon it if you have sensitive data you wish to protect			2
' this is n't the first time @entity15 's @entity4 scanner has been exposed as vulnerable			1
in april last year a group of @entity102 hackers managed to spoof the scanner using a dummy print			2
this situation is made worse by the fact that once a password has been initially used to access @entity68 and @entity15 phones , the fingerprint can be continually used for access without re-entering the password - even if the phone is rebooted			1
alternatively , on @entity106 phones a password is required following every reboot			0
that does n't mean that @entity106 's @entity105 scanner is without flaws			2
it took hackers just two days and a small collection of everyday household items to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an @entity113 following its launch in 2013			2
@entity106 's @entity105 is n't without flaws either			0
it took hackers just two days and a small collection of everyday household items to bypass the fingerprint sensor ( shown ) on an @entity113 following its launch in 2013 @entity115 , based in @entity116 , took a high - resolution photograph of a fingerprint from the side of a glass			2
they then scanned it , before laser printing it onto a transparent sheet and covering it in woodglue			0
once the glue had dried , they peeled off the print copy and pressed it on the scanner			2
@entity196 , global director of gadget insurer @entity197 told @entity136 : ' this underpins the importance of security research			0
' there ’s no room for flaws in fingerprint id systems now that mobile payments are becoming commonplace			0
in a survey we carried out , almost a third ( 31 per cent ) of @entity209 mobile users told us they want to wait until mobile payment technology is more advanced before trying it themselves and , with a step back like this , it may take even more time to assuage consumer fears over security and fraud			0
' @entity219 , senior manager in @entity221 's cyber security practice added : ' replacing passwords with biometric alternatives such as fingerprints provides better security , however it does n't completely eliminate the risk posed by cyber criminals			0
' the largest hurdle with biometrics going forward will be the establishment of consumer trust			0
a fingerprint was photographed using 2400 dpi resolution			0
the image was inverted and laser printed onto a transparent sheet with a thick toner setting			0
hackers then poured woodglue onto the print pattern , pictured top			0
after it dried , the sheet was lifted and pressed onto the sensor , pictured bottom , to unlock the phone ' trying to convince the average person to implant a piece of technology to increase security of their perceived already secure account is a battle unlikely to be won			0
' and @entity254 , co-founder and technical director at @entity256 said : ' biometric authentication is not yet near the level it needs to be for the majority of consumer facing organisations to implement it in their products			0
' fingerprint scanning , eyeball scanning , voice and face recognition are all at least a decade away from being reliable enough to use as authentication methods			0
' the technology simply is n't sophisticated enough .			0

experts have discovered a flaw in older versions of the @entity5 system
once a hacker has access to a phone they can monitor data from sensors
from this , they can potentially intercept a fingerprint from the scanner
vulnerability has been tested and confirmed on the @entity4
