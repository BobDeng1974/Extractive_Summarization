updated : 13:42 est , 5 december 2011 the @entity0 might have cost billions , but one facility has been lacking up till now - any kind of laundry			0
brave - and strong - stomached - astronauts usually wear underwear for three or four days before putting them in a capsule that is ejected and burns up in the atmosphere			1
other clothes are worn ' for months '			0
@entity9 has asked @entity11 - based @entity10 to build a low - power , low - water washer - dryer that can make life 250 miles up a bit more pleasant			1
previously , the inhabitants of the @entity0 had to wear underwear for three to four days at once - and other clothes ' for months ' @entity9 astronaut @entity19 : previously , dirty clothes were simply ejected from the @entity0 in a capsule which burns up in the atmosphere it would initially be deployed on the @entity0 , but also serve as a template for future missions such as to @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity9 commissioned the research because of the high cost of sending anything into space , which works out as between £ 3,100 and £ 6,200 per 500g			0
this has meant that astronauts were only allowed a limited number of underpants per trip to keep costs down			1
preliminary designs by @entity10 suggest that it plans to use air , jets of water vapour and microwave rays to clean the clothes			1
the @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 ) would also use a vacuum for drying the clothes off			0

the proposal for the device - which states it has already been successfully tested in zero gravity environment - claims that it would achieve ‘ greatly enhanced softness ’ over previous such machines			0
the proposal adds : ‘ @entity61 was achieved by an array of three air jets , two to generate a cyclonic effect and a third to induce tumbling by blowing perpendicular to the plane of rotation			1
’ @entity9 said it wanted to develop a machine that would work for ‘ long duration human missions beyond low @entity69 ’			2
it said : ‘ the system is suitable for use in any long term space mission where resupply logistics preclude routine delivery of fresh crew clothing and removal of disposable clothing articles			2
box of @entity79 : @entity9 's solution is rather more hi - tech , and involves bombarding clothes with microwaves ‘ while the proposed laundry system is microgravity compatible , the system will be completely functional in reduced gravity environments			2
’ @entity10 has also submitted a second proposal to @entity9 - a human waste incinerator			0
it describes its design as ‘ light , compact , simple , energy efficient , contains few moving parts , is virtually maintenance free - and requires little astronaut time			0

astronauts previously wore underwear for three days
system will use air , water vapour and microwave rays
may help missions to @entity27 be more *hygienic*
