so it seems a little odd that the @entity7 are paying tribute to the @entity9 by selling off an extraordinary array of tat , including mugs , baby grows and tea towels			1
the bizarre collection of @entity17 - branded goods went on sale at the party ’s conference in @entity21 , ahead of an official tribute to the late leader as part of what has been dubbed ‘ @entity26 ’			1
tribute : @entity13 grows are on sale at the @entity29 during the @entity17 party conference in @entity21 @entity2 died in april at the age of 87 , sparking a wave of tributes from senior conservatives			1
a 10 - minute tribute to the former prime minister opened the conference today , followed by a speech from party chairman @entity39 drawing heavily on her upbringing as the daughter of a grocer			1
but outside the conference hall the spirit of enterprise is alive and well , with the @entity9 ’s image , name and slogans used to sell a wide range of memorabilia			1
it includes an ‘ @entity58 ’ baby grow costing £ 15 , a £ 8 bib and t - shirts costing £ 12 featuring the words : ‘ the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of people ’s money			2
there is also a £ 7 tea towel with the slogan : ‘ you may have to fight a battle more than once to win it			0
’ however a £ 25 ironing board cover paying homage to the @entity9 was mysteriously withdrawn from sale			1
memorabilia : @entity72 displays a @entity74 bib on the @entity17 stand keys to power : these £ 4.50 key rings are on sale on the stand to @entity17 party members @entity81 lead the eulogies in the 10 - minute video , called @entity84 , which featured comments from leading @entity17 politicians past and present			1
on the weekend @entity2 's ashes were buried , mr @entity81 said the former premier 's greatest legacy had been to ‘ save our country ’			0
delegates all joined in a prolonged standing ovation at the end of the film which touched on key @entity97 policies of encouraging home ownership , privatisation and the " export of freedom " in the choice to stand against the @entity103 during the @entity104			2
the falklands war was also the focus of a major section of tributes			0
@entity2 died in april and received a @entity109 at @entity110 , attended by the @entity111			1
cheers : bottles of our @entity114 have been snapped up by @entity17 members to toast the former prime minister who died in april no bottler : the first day of the @entity17 conference was dubbed @entity26 , with a 10 - minute video paying tribute to the @entity9 hard labour : former @entity124 spin doctor @entity123 posed with a bottle of @entity126 , as part of his campaign against alcohol abuse in the film , mr @entity81 said : ‘ she was a conviction politician ... she did not believe in accepting the consensus			1
‘ she was a great conservative because she put @entity17 principles into action			1
‘ she knew it was not enough to debate , to think , to talk - you need to act			2
‘ that 's what she did - she reshaped @entity5 in a new @entity17 mould ... she saved our country , that is her true legacy			1
’ featured in the film were chancellor @entity147 , @entity2 's close friend @entity148 mp and @entity17 mp @entity149			1
off the cuff : these £ 12 cufflinks use one of @entity2 's most famous slogans to raise a smile no mug : there is almost no item which has not been branded by the @entity84 shop , including these £ 7 mugs taking notes : several @entity17 politicians have sought to echo @entity2 during their speeches in the main conference hall @entity2 became mp for @entity165 in 1959 and was conservative prime minister between 1979 and 1990			1
mr @entity39 used his speech opening the conference to draw inspiration from @entity2 ’s upbringing			2
he told delegates : ‘ we ’ve been busy making @entity5 the most attractive place to set up shop			2
because make no mistake – it ’s this party – once led by a grocer ’s daughter – which is and always will be the party of small business			0
’ mr @entity39 said @entity2 inspired him to set up his own print business			0
‘ i ’ll never forget lying awake at night worrying about paying the bills			0
‘ or going to the cinema with friends , only to find out later that i ’d missed the best bits of the film because i ’d been so deep in thought worrying about cash flow			0
there was a constant pressure to bring in enough print work to pay the wages at the end of the month			0
and as we grew , we took on more employees			0
@entity2 inspired me and millions of others to set up shop			2
‘ she never forgot the hard - working people of this country			2
’ inspiration : @entity17 party chairman @entity39 , pictured with wife @entity201 , used a speech opening the conference to @entity2 inspired him to start his own print business bitter : the @entity205 has also been targeted by the @entity17 party props department , with a range of satirically - labelled beer bottles including @entity209 and @entity210 he went on : ' what a remarkable woman			1
' i 'm enormously proud to be the chairman of a party once led by @entity2			0
' it 's a pride in her that we all share in this hall			0
shared by the tens - of - thousands who lined the streets of @entity225 back in april to show their respect to @entity5 's first female prime minister			2
' we 're the oldest democratic party in world			0
we 've had many great leaders - we 've got one now , and we 'll have many more			0
