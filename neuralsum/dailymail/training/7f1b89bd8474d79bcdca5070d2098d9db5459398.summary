by @entity0 last updated at 3:36 pm on 8th february 2012 @entity1 was six months into her pregnancy when she realised she was having twins - baby @entity3 was so small that she had not been picked up on previous scans			1
but it was not until six years after her birth that @entity3 was diagnosed with primordial dwarfism , a disorder which means she has had a smaller body size than others her age since before she was born			1
now 13 - years - old , four - foot - tall @entity12 ca n't help but look up to her sister , @entity13 who measures 5ft1in			1
and she will look up to her twin more and more over the coming years - as @entity13 is unlikely to grow any taller			2
close bond : @entity3 looks up to her twin @entity13 who is more than a foot taller than she is the blonde - haired , blue - eyed teens love shopping , wearing make - up and giggling about boys			1
but due to a rare brain abnormality @entity12 also has the learning age of an eight - year - old			1
@entity3 said : ' most of the time i do n't really care i 'm different - it actually makes me feel special			1
' @entity13 looks out for me and we do loads together - shopping , swimming and singing			0
' she can be bossy but she shows me how to flirt with boys , stands up for me if i 'm teased and reaches things when they 're too high			0
' the sisters were born three months prematurely , with @entity3 weighing slightly more than a pound			1
doctors warned their mother , @entity38 , 34 , that @entity13 had just a ten per cent chance of surviving			0
but after 108 days in neonatal intensive care @entity13 was fit enough to join her family at their home near @entity44 , @entity45			0
surprise : @entity12 , left , was only picked up on ultrasound scans six months into mother @entity38 's pregnancy because she was so small growing up together : the blonde - haired , blue - eyed teens love shopping , wearing make - up and giggling about boys			1
but due to a rare brain abnormality @entity12 also has the learning age of an eight year old it was only when she was six years old that @entity3 was diagnosed with primordial dwarfism , a rare form of dwarfism which affects around 200 people in the world			1
and @entity12 is the only primordial dwarf to have an average sized twin			2
' in a lot of ways @entity12 is just me , but smaller			2
like any sister , she 's annoying especially when she steals my clothes - even though my tops come down to her knees ' @entity38 , who lives with her daughters , their step - dad @entity73 and his son @entity74 , 17 , said : ' @entity3 was five weeks behind in development and they said she might not survive - but i refused to believe the worst			1
' i had a c - section at 34 weeks			0
it was terrifying , the girls were tiny and @entity3 looked like an alien			2
' she had a big head and her skin was see - though			0
we could hold her in one hand , she wore nappies that were smaller than an @entity86 , and we bought her dolls ' clothes			0
but the girls ' bond was immediate , ' on top of the world : @entity12 has special needs classes , but attends the same school as her twin where she also has lessons in @entity98 , hip hop dancing and cheerleading one pound @entity3 was so small that a wedding ring could fit around her arm			1
she immediately had surgery to correct a hole in the heart , and after overcoming chronic lung disease was allowed home			0
@entity12 still needs surgery to correct a curvature of the spine and the bones in her ears are so small she has to wear hearing aids			1
she has special needs classes , but attends the same school as her twin where she also has lessons in @entity98 , hip hop dancing and cheerleading			0
last year the sisters both entered a beauty pageant , too			0
@entity38 said : ' @entity12 does n't let it affect her - when she comes home she 'll often shout , " @entity121 in the house ! "			1
though it sometimes gets her down that she ca n't play volleyball like @entity13 and the boys do n't show as much interest in her			0
' @entity38 , pictured with her daughters and their step - dad @entity73 says : ' @entity12 does n't let it affect her - when she comes home she 'll often shout , " dwarf in the house ! " ' @entity13 said : ' in a lot of ways @entity12 is just me , but smaller			2
like any sister , she 's annoying especially when she steals my clothes - even though my tops come down to her knees			2
but i 'll always protect her			0
if she 's teased at school i 'll tell the bullies it 's not cool			0
' @entity38 , an insurance agent , added : ' as @entity13 gets more independent , i worry about how @entity12 will be affected - stuff like going shopping on her own just would n't be safe because she 's so small and has a lower learning age			1
' but i try to treat the girls as equals			0
@entity12 has a real passion for life and makes everyone laugh			2
i 'm so proud of both my girls			0

@entity3 was so small she was not *spotted* on scans until six months into her mother 's pregnancy
due to a rare brain abnormality , @entity12 also has the learning age of an eight - year - old
