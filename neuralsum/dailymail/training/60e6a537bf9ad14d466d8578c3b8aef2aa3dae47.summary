@entity0 , who is accused of passing classified military information to a @entity3 lover 32 years his junior @entity6 officials say a 27 - year - old university student from @entity3 started a relationship with a civilian defense contractor more than twice her age and then found out classified information on @entity6 nuclear weaponry , missile defenses and war plans			1
but is she a spy ? it is clear the @entity17 believes the woman 's boyfriend broke the law , but the criminal complaint that outlines the charges against him never formally accuses her of any crime			1
it just paints a picture of a young woman who seems to be involved in espionage			2
a @entity17 official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing says the government knows the woman 's location and is continuing to investigate her role			2
her identity and whereabouts have n't been released , and @entity6 authorities also have n't said publicly whether they believe she is working for the @entity3 government			1
she lives in the @entity6 as a student on a @entity43 , according to an affidavit the @entity45 filed this week by the @entity45 in @entity46 in @entity47			1
her boyfriend , @entity0 , a 59 - year - old civilian defense contractor who works at @entity49 , met the woman at a @entity52 conference on military defense issues			1
they began an intimate , romantic relationship in june 2011 , according to the affidavit			2
at the time , @entity0 was working at a @entity49 office that develops plans to deter potential @entity6 adversaries , according to his @entity72 profile online			2
@entity0 is scheduled to appear in federal court friday for a hearing on whether he should stay in detention while prosecutors pursue their case			2
@entity78 , @entity0 's attorney , said he planned to seek bail but was n't optimistic he would be successful			2
@entity78 declined to discuss details of the case , saying he had not yet spoken in depth to his client			2
a preliminary hearing is scheduled for april 1			0
the affidavit says the woman told @entity0 repeatedly she did n't want him to tell her anything classified but continued to question @entity0 about his work			0
@entity0 , on the other hand , told her he would n't give her any classified information but did so anyway , the document said			0
@entity0 , a lieutenant colonel in the @entity92 , is accused of telling her secrets about @entity6 nuclear weapons , missile defenses , war plans , early warning radar systems and other issues			1
last month , the woman asked @entity0 what western countries knew about a @entity3 naval asset			0
this fell outside the scope of @entity0 's work but he conducted open source record research for her and collected and reviewed classified information on the topic , the affidavit said			0
@entity0 's security clearance required him to disclose his contacts with foreign nationals , but the affidavit says he failed to let officials know about his relationship with the woman			0
the @entity45 declined further comment on tuesday			0
a @entity17 spokesman in @entity47 did not return a call seeking comment			1
@entity0 was married until last year , according to state documents in @entity122			1
his ex-wife declined comment when approached by @entity124 on tuesday at her home in @entity126 , @entity122			1
her neighbor , @entity127 , said it was clear @entity0 was having an affair with a @entity3 woman prior to the divorce			0
@entity132 , who said she is friends with the ex-wife , said the girlfriend was a university student in the @entity137 , though she did n't know which school			0
@entity132 said neighbors knew @entity0 worked for the government in @entity52 but were unclear on his exact job			1
@entity142 , a member of the @entity143 , said @entity3 has used sexual entrapment as a means to gather intelligence before and the allegations are n't surprising			0
as an army reserve officer and defense contractor , @entity0 would have received security briefings on this and understood ' how sex may be used for intelligence targeting , ' @entity142 said			1
whether @entity6 national security was damaged by any of the alleged disclosures would depend on how detailed the information was and whether the woman knew any of it was classified , said @entity159 , director of programs at @entity161			0
information on weapons could be harmful because it could tell a potential enemy what @entity6 weapons system can do as well as what capabilities the adversary would need to develop to counter @entity6 capabilities , he said			0
@entity0 's position would n't have given him access to specifics about weapons technology , though , @entity159 said			0
leaked details on military plans might also be detrimental			1
' that 's an important part , because if you divulge enough information about the planning process , you end up giving information that reveals a strategy and how you could counter that strategy , ' @entity159 said			0
the key issues for any trial will be @entity0 's intent and the sophistication of the information he passed on , @entity159 said			0
@entity0 is charged with one count of communicating national defense information to a person not entitled to receive it and one count of unlawfully retaining national defense documents and plans			1
@entity0 's home in @entity195 , @entity52 , where authorities found secret documents he was not supposed to have @entity0 's lawyer @entity78 said his client would never do anything to intentionally harm the @entity6			1

@entity201 , 59 , of @entity47 , charged with passing on secrets
the defense contractor met younger lover at military defense conference
he did not tell authorities about her as he should have done
a *covert* search of his home in @entity52 found documents marked ' secret '
