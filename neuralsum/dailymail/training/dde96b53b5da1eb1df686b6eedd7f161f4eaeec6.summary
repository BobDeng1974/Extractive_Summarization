members of the @entity2 ' aviation agency are holding high - level safety talks for only the second time in 70 years after hundreds of air passengers and crew were killed in a series of high - profile tragedies in 2014			1
the disastrous year has prompted government and aviation officials from dozens of countries to gather in @entity11 this week for an @entity12 ( @entity12 ) assembly to discuss the risks of flying over conflict zones and how to prevent planes from vanishing			1
@entity17 is leading a push for sweeping changes after its state - owned flag carrier , @entity20 , suffered two air disasters within five months last year			1
@entity17 wants mandatory reporting of conflict zone risks after a @entity20 plane was shot down the @entity27 country is pushing for real - time aircraft tracking and calling on the @entity2 to force its member states to warn airlines about the risks of flying over conflict zones			1
one of @entity20 ' planes disappeared and has not been located , and another was shot down over eastern @entity33 , where the @entity33 military and @entity36 rebels are still involved in a heavy battle for territory			1
all 298 passengers and crew were killed when flight @entity41 was shot down while flying from @entity43 to @entity44 last july			2
since that incident the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) has faced pressure to develop new systems to share intelligence and warn airlines about new threats associated with conflict zones			2
all 298 passengers and crew were killed when flight @entity41 was shot down over eastern @entity33 @entity54 , director general of @entity17 's @entity55 , said a proposal to create a central website where states and agencies could voluntarily publish warnings does not go far enough			1
speaking at the @entity12 assembly , he was quoted by @entity62 as saying that reports from @entity12 member states should be ‘ mandatory and timely ’			0
he added : ‘ we can not delay implementing changes in the way global commercial aviation operates			0
’ the @entity12 ’s proposal is backed by the @entity70 and @entity71 , which lost 196 citizens when flight @entity73 went down			0
the @entity12 is holding its second high - level safety conference in 70 years the @entity71 also wants airlines to tell passengers before take - off whether their flight will cross a conflict zone			1
the @entity70 said @entity41 was hit with a ground - to - air missile fired by rebels , but @entity82 insists that the aircraft was shot down by a @entity33 fighter jet			0
it was flying at about 33,000ft after @entity33 had warned airlines to remain above 32,000ft			0
@entity17 is also pushing for real - time aircraft tracking to become an industry standard , despite the costs			1
search teams have found no trace of flight mh370 despite scouring 25,000 square miles of ocean it follows the disappearance of @entity95 , which was carrying 239 people from @entity44 to @entity97			0
despite extensive search efforts in the @entity100 teams have been unable to find any debris or the plane ’s black boxes			0
in a working paper presented to the assembly , @entity17 said : ‘ we believe , based on our unfortunate experience , ( it ) will be offset by the benefits of enhancing the effectiveness of the alerting and search and rescue services			2
‘ the disappearance of @entity95 demonstrates the crucial need to improve aircraft tracking systems for the sake of safety and security			0
the @entity12 assembly is likely to endorse a plane tracking system that sends signals every 15 minutes ‘ in this day and age , the fact that an aeroplane could go missing and that the flight recorders could be so difficult to recover is unacceptable			0
’ despite @entity17 ’s demands the @entity12 conference is likely to back a less - costly system that sends tracking signals every 15 minutes , but would increase the intervals to every minute in an emergency or if a plane deviates from its route			1
current standards require long - haul flights over water to report their position about every 45 minutes			2
delegates are also studying how ejectable and buoyant black boxes would assist rescuers and investigators when a plane crashes .			0

more than 500 were killed in two tragedies involving @entity20
@entity17 says countries should be forced to report conflict zone risks
@entity2 agency is proposing a central website with voluntary warnings
