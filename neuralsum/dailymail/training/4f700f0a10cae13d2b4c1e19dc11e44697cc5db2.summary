researchers have found that more exciting a show is , the less likely women are to binge on calorie - laden food			1
a dull show , on the other hand , increases the risk of gorging on unhealthy snacks by 52 per cent			0
women who watch ' boring ' tv shows are 52 per cent more likely to binge as they watch , a study found scientists from @entity18 in @entity19 studied 18 women , analysing them as they snacked and watched a range of different programmes			1
the women were shown an ' engaging ' episode of a popular @entity19 comedy show , reported @entity26 , as well as a ' boring ' art lecture			1
as a control the scientists also monitored bingeing habits while the women took part in another ' boring ' activity - reading a text on insects living in @entity19			1
their findings revealed that boring content increased a women 's propensity to snack on unhealthy foods			1
instead , women watching tv should opt for healthy snacks , replacing crisps with vegetables , say the researchers while watching ' dull ' shows , the women taking part binged on 52 per cent more food than during the ' entertaining ' comedy programme			1
and the trend held up across different media , the researchers found			0
participants ate 35 per cent less when watching the ' engaging ' episode on tv , compared with reading about insects			2
the findings have prompted the team of scientists to question whether it is in fact how exciting or engaging the tv we watch is , rather than the act itself , that causes a person to eat more			2
' at very low levels of engagement , you kind of eat to engage yourself because you ’re bored , ' said @entity67 , a research associate at @entity69 ’s @entity68 and @entity70 ' it might also have to do with the pacing			0
' but he said the key is to ensure you choose healthy snacks while settling on the sofa for a night in front of the tv			2
he added : ' use pre-portioned snacks as opposed to endless bowls			0
' that means keeping the source of food out of sight , too			0
' if you know you have a tendency to overeat while watching tv just snack on something that ’s better for you			2
have veggies as a snack instead of chips			0
