but a row of luxury seaside chalets at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , were destroyed by bulldozers in a matter of minutes after they were condemned following a landslide			1
the wooden huts , worth at total of £ 1million , were left in a precarious positions after 500 tons of earth fell down the cliffs on which they were positioned			2
a bulldozer makes light work of the demolition work as it grabs wood and wires from one of the chalets the debris from the chalets was put onto the back of a lorry before being taken away today some chalet owners were insured but others will have to swallow the bitter pill that their holiday idyll is gone eleven chalets will not have their licences renewed because of the landslip having been deemed by the council to be unsafe , the owners were given time to retrieve what they could before demolition work began			1
pictures taken today show bulldozers moving in and knocking down what was left of the chalets which had to be removed to prevent them from falling onto other huts and causing further devastation			2
each hut is worth about £ 70,000 but due to the seaside location and the coastal views they enjoy their sell - on value is between £ 175,000 to £ 200,000			0
the steady deluge from the landslip built up behind the cabins and pushed them forwards until they were precariously perched on the sloping cliff , with one even tilted up at a 30 degree angle			2
the landslide has rendered the stretch of @entity65 ’s @entity64 so unsafe it has been closed off to the public			1
gutted : luxury seaside chalets worth an estimated one million pounds have been demolished after being condemned by a series of huge landslides the devastated owners were told by the local authority that the area was unsafe and had to salvage their belongings before bulldozers were brought in to level the chalets @entity76 , which owns the land , announced it will not renew the licences for 11 of the chalets			1
one owner said : ' some people are covered by insurance and some are not			0
luckily for us our property is			0
' we are only allowed to insure it up to £ 70,000			0
the total value of ours was £ 200,000 so the rest of the value is the location and the ongoing licence			0
the holiday homes , that overlook @entity93 , can only be lived in for nine months of the year and are empty over the winter			2
they are privately owned but the land they are on is owned by @entity76 which receives £ 2,500 a year in rent from each plot			0
@entity7 is named after the @entity100 , who landed there in 1685 during his attempt to take the crown from @entity104 following the defeat of the @entity100 , twelve locals were hanged on the beach			1
the huts , much sought - after thanks to the location , were heavily damaged by mudslides and condemned holiday nightmare : the beach below the chalets remains closed to the public up to 500 tonnes of sliding mud , caused by heavy rainfall , caused the damage disaster : the chalets at @entity7 in @entity9 were falling into the sea after huge landslides triggered by heavy rain this chalet is worth £ 200,000 but was so badly damaged it had to be pulled down before it fell into the sea the stretch of @entity65 's @entity64 at @entity7 in @entity9 is so unsafe it has had to be closed the beach remains closed to the public after huge landslides which has destroyed holiday homes the owners of 18 chalets were allowed into their one - bed holiday homes one at a time to clear out their belongings after the disaster some of the chalets are precariously perched on a cliff after mud built up behind the buildings and pushed them towards the sea devastated : one chalet owner had his holiday home for 60 years but it was written off following the landslide			1
