it was going to take something special to get things going again on the old sofa			1
for a month of glorious @entity7 football , we telly watching fans were held transfixed as the good stuff just kept on coming			1
of course , @entity9 had the chance to have us blowing the dust off of the remote control and flick over to @entity13			1
but that was a false dawn			1
i suppose we ’d just have to hunker down and wait for the new season to start ? not a bit of it			2
instead , a young @entity19 making his living in our green and pleasant land got the juices flowing again			2
@entity23 could not have timed his return to championship - winning form any better			1
triumph : @entity23 celebrates at the 17th hole shortly before winning the open championship we needed a homegrown hero to do it it on our turf just to remind us that great sport watching comes in all shapes and sizes			1
and the @entity37 really delivered our young hero			1
this truly was the @entity40			2
there was already something in the air as early as thursday morning			2
if you ’re ever looking for a man to be positively churchillian about sport in these @entity47 , then you need look no further than @entity48			1
before a ball had barely been struck he told us he was ‘ pawing the ground and sniffing the air like an old war horse ’ at the prospect of what was to come			2
it ’s as if he sensed something special was about unfold over the next few days			2
well , the old war horse was n’t wrong			2
and what did in fact come was delivered by the @entity37 in a manner that put the viewer straight in the comfort zone			1
led by the venerable , veteran commentator , he completed his rounds with a bagful of voices - essentially homegrown - who suited any situation			2
while the images generated could have been served up with free cream teas and scones			2
special day : @entity23 , the champion , celebrates with his mum after securing the win at @entity77 this was highlighted perfectly on friday lunchtime when the director launched into a dramatic super slo - mo ‘ hero package ’ of @entity83			1
@entity86 , in his gentle @entity85 lilt , followed it with a slightly awkward ‘ ladies and gentlemen			0
@entity83 ! ’ - sounding ever so slightly awkward that they ’d just been a bit too showy			0
similarly , on saturday evening , @entity23 was pieced together in a montage boasting a piece of music @entity94 in its heyday might have thought a bit over the top			1
yes , the @entity99 do it in their coverage			0
and it sits perfectly well in their tournaments			1
but here , well , @entity48 had only told us minutes earlier he ’d had a postcard from @entity106 who ’d been fed up with the football and could n’t wait for the @entity109			0
while on sunday morning , @entity110 was stood on a picnic table outside the fish and chip stall asking ‘ good people of @entity114 , who do you want to win this ? ’			0
i ’ll leave you to guess what the answer was			0
but the point is , our telly is n’t at its best when its full of bombast			0
it ’s just not , well , @entity125			0
( i should just point out here that i really , really like the graphic ribbon that accompanied some of the tee shots			0
so yes , if you need me , i ’ll be over there in hypocrites corner ) @entity94 moment : @entity134 , pictured with the @entity133 , had been pieced together in a montage for tv viewers in fact , all you really need , it would seem , is to just keep that camera set on @entity40			0
of course , this is where the @entity37 , and we , got lucky			1
because the young maestro was captivating stuff from shot one			0
and there was such a pep in his step , he was even compelling viewing inbetween shots			0
during the final round , the striding , imperious @entity23 was spotted in all manner of settings			1
there he was , at one point , stalking through the long grass like he was the subject of a @entity160 documentary			0
then he was just a white baseball cap , bobbing along in a sea of spectators			0
and in possibly the best telly shot of the championship , our young hero approached his standing ovation at the 18th green in perfect step with a chorus line of white polo - shirted ( what @entity173 called ) ‘ heavies ’			1
in fact , there was one more image			0
when @entity23 had won it			1
he left the green , went under the stand and across the footbridge to record his score			0
again , @entity184 was on , but now there was no crowd , just a young champion realising what he had just achieved			0
his face was an absolute picture as he allowed himself to really think about what had just happened			0
i tell you something , it was dear old @entity195 at the end of @entity197 good ! those heady days when @entity198 wore the sun like a halo as we said farewell to a magnificent @entity7 are only just over a week old			1
and my front room is better for having played host to them			0
but a few rounds of golf by the seaside up on the @entity209 means that great sport on the telly is already moving on .			1

@entity23 triumph continued a brilliant *summer* of sport following @entity7 in @entity216
@entity218 timed his victory perfectly as @entity37 delivered the hero
