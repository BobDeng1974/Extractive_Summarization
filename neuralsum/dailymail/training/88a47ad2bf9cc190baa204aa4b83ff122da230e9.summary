by @entity0 against my will , i 've become a bargain basement shopper			1
whereas i once frequented the hallowed halls of @entity6 , now it 's @entity7 and @entity8			1
just the lighting alone is jarring , to say the least			1
what 's interesting though , is that i frequently catch the eye of one of my well turned out peers who i 'm certain is making the same adjustment as me			1
@entity0 says it is possible to live a champagne lifestyle on a tighter budget in our case it 's a new baby that has made the difference , but for some it may be saving to get on the property ladder , expensive ivf treatments , school fees or buying a new home			1
whatever it is , it 's nice to know that i 'm not alone			1
having said that , although my formerly @entity33 lifestyle is rapidly downshifting into a @entity35 world - my tastes have n't changed at all			1
and whilst i find myself hurtling towards middle age in a home cluttered with @entity38 , i can tell you that i am not ready to swap my @entity40 for @entity41 and my @entity42 for @entity43			1
therefore , after careful investigation , i 've put together a guide to the best luxe - loving and glam values out there			1
and if , like me , your budget no longer matches your carefully cultivated taste levels , this one 's for you			1
i 'm a total bed linen snob and i can talk thread count with the best of them			1
the first time my 4 month old vomited on my 1200 count white @entity58 cotton i felt a physical pain			1
thankfully i 've now discovered a website called @entity62			1
they 've supplied top five - star hotels for over 20 years ; including @entity65 , @entity66 , and @entity67			1
best @entity62 supply bedding for luxury hotels such as @entity65 but there sets are available from £ 115 this is a 5 - star sleep experience in your own home			1
a set , which includes a flat or fitted sheet , duvet cover and 2 - 4 pillowcases starts at £ 115			1
@entity79 for those of us who like to cook , or in my case have fancy pots and pans i do n't use , on display - we all know how expensive @entity87 is			2
gorgeous , lasts forever and a true status symbol on the stove			2
check out @entity91 's new range that comes in a kicky aqua and fantastic lapis blue			2
a great alternative , cooks like a dream and looks v snazzy			2
@entity0 loves the @entity87 style pots available at @entity91 and what about the all important beauty upkeep ? @entity99 such as @entity100 have personal spray @entity101 who come to their home and give them a customised spray tan			1
no more streaking , no brown palms or stains in between fingers			2
and in @entity110 at least you can get a similar service on a budget			2
@entity113 , which sprays for tv shows like @entity116 and dancing on ice offers a bespoke spray tan for £ 40			1
and even better , they come to you ! this service is available across @entity110 ( call @entity121 or @entity122 ) i know @entity124 does well for clothes but i had no idea they made such stylish home accessories			2
recently bemoaning the costs of setting up a home office , i was delighted to discover a great range of options			2
this stylish lamp for £ 25 was a steal			2
@entity0 was pleasantly surprised by the range of stylish homewears available at @entity124 are you amongst those of us who can immediately identify @entity141 's @entity140 ( £ 78 ) ? @entity142 has made a very clever substitute			1
it 's called @entity145 and @entity146 and every time i wear it , i get asked if it 's the @entity141 signature scent			2
i am in love with it as much as i am the fact that it costs a mere £ 14			2
@entity0 says that @entity142 's @entity145 scent could easily be mistaken for @entity141 although i am not by any means an attachment parent , a new baby invariably made us long for a bigger bed			1
early morning play and sleep sessions , and just general exhaustion left us fighting for our corners			2
i got a tip off from a producer friend who works on a home design show			2
apparently this site is a major decorator 's secret with designer furnishings that look more expensive than they are			2
we ordered the @entity172 , and i can honestly say that in addition to saving more than 1000 pounds from others i had found , it 's the prettiest bed i 've ever seen			0
@entity0 saved more than £ 1000 on her bed from @entity177 i admit it , i am a total and complete candle snob			1
i can smell a @entity180 from a mile away , but at something like £ 40 , their role in my household expenditures is now taken over by @entity185 and @entity186			0
i have found some lovely , less expensive alternatives			0
check out @entity188 , lovely looking and at £ 22 , good value ( beautybay.com )			0
also the dotcomgiftshop has some beautifully elegant candles for just £ 9.95 - i loved the @entity192 and @entity193 @entity0 is a self confessed candle snob but is very keen on the dotcomgiftshop 's offerings at £ 9.95 i 'll never forget when a very famous @entity199 tv presenter confessed to me that her massive diamond wedding rings set was from @entity201			1
' everyone expects me to have enormous and expensive rings , but i 'd never spend that kind of money on jewellery			0
' her sparkling ' diamonds ' were so pretty and i 'd always envied them , i could n't believe they were n't the real thing			0
so , if your budget does n't allow for the ring from @entity215 's you covet , check out @entity201			0
some of their pieces are truly lovely - and would fool all but the most practiced eye			0
www.carat.co @entity201 is great for those of you without a @entity215 budget my feet changed dramatically whilst pregnant , so post baby i was faced with a priceless wardrobe of shoes that no longer fit			0
you can thus imagine my utter delight upon discovering @entity228 in @entity229 which does a mean @entity230 inspired white heel and a kicky pair that look like ' @entity233			0
however , it was this pair that really got me excited			0
they are very similar to the expensive wedges that @entity237 lives in and retail for £ 50 instead of @entity237 's £ 230 version			0
despite being grounded at home more these days , i still love a little night away			0
the free to download app @entity241 allows you to book a room in 250 destinations at a huge discount			0
@entity0 loves @entity228 in @entity248 's wedges that steal @entity237 's style for £ 50 the only catch is , you ca n't choose the hotel until the day of - but they have gorgeous properties in most major cities , and you are virtually guaranteed a lovely selection			1
we tried the swanky @entity258 hotel in @entity259 at a 50 % savings and loved it			0
and another cash saving trick is to look out for new hotel launches			0
ceo of luxury travel specialists @entity265 pr www.foxpr.co.uk @entity263 says , ' hotels traditionally offer great value when they first open			1
keep on top of local news in the location you 're interested in , watch for hotel openings and book early			0
travel specialist @entity265 recommends the @entity275 in @entity276 , @entity58 , for a spring break @entity0 stayed in the @entity278 on a recent trip to @entity58 and said it was great value for money ' you can often secure an incredible deal if you 're amongst the first wave of guests			1
' her pick this season ? @entity275 in @entity276 , @entity58 which opens in may			0
early bookings are now only £ 150 per night for the 5 - star , ultra glam , beach - fronted hotel , dresortgocek.com.tr			0
@entity0 says that although she is spending more and more time in @entity8 , she is a @entity6 girl at heart and for planning a trip for the whole family , if you want luxury without a massive hotel bill , consider @entity299 ( holidaylettings.co.uk )			1
we stayed at the @entity301 ( @entity302 76799 ) on a recent trip to @entity58 and were completely blown away			0
and at 222 pounds a night , a cost shared by 6 adults , it was incredible value			0
breath - taking sea views , roof deck terraces with sun loungers , fresh bread delivered each morning , maid service and chefs available , as well as an infinity pool and flat screened entertainment system to die for ; it was truly a-list living			0
it was ideal for a family and far less pricey than a hotel			0
for general pampering , look for ways to multi-task your treatments			1
@entity327 ' @entity326 salons offer 15 minute ' @entity328 ' for clients who want to use their down - time in the salon ( when colour is processing ) or whilst their hair is being shampooed and conditioned			0
at £ 20 each the mini-facials are combined with a hand and arm massage and a lie down on a reclining massage bed			0
if the treatments are booked with a colour service they are just £ 15			0
the bottom line : you may be more likely to spot me at @entity7 than @entity345 these days , but i still like the finer things in life			0
and until things change , you 'll find me dreaming of the day when @entity352 stocks @entity350 and @entity353 designs .			0

our style *blogger* @entity0 has had to make a few cut backs since becoming a mother
but she says there are ways to live a luxury lifestyle without the price tag
here @entity0 shows you how to cheat your way to the high end
