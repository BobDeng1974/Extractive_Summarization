by @entity0 @entity2 born photographer @entity1 traveled to 44 mini-mansions in five different continents to photograph the rise of the upper middle class across the globe and its impact on suburban home @entity10 's photography project , ' @entity13 ' documents suburban homes in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity22			1
his book , which he self - published this year and can be purchased on @entity24 , pays particular attention to these regions because they are the suburbs outside of the world 's developing economic hubs			1
@entity30 reports that @entity1 , who is now based in @entity31 , first had the idea to start the project while traveling to @entity34 where he was enrolled in a photography workshop			2
' i was stunned to spot a suburban sub development amidst the landscape outside of the city , ' he told @entity30 about looking out of the window of the plane while it was landing			0
@entity43 : a decadent home in @entity46 in @entity18 , @entity44 has a view of the tall buildings in the distance south of the cabinet : this is a photo taken inside of a home in @entity54 in @entity21 , @entity55 twin beds in @entity57 : this is a photo of a bedroom inside of a home in @entity61 in @entity34 , @entity57 if you break it you buy it : this is a photo of a bedroom inside of a home in @entity68 in @entity17 , @entity69 @entity16 score : this mini golf course is inside of a home in @entity73 in @entity16 , @entity74 his website says that the homes in @entity34 reminded him of the ' cookie - cutter houses that resembled structures in his home country of @entity2			0
' he told @entity30 he was allowed to go back to the suburb called @entity61 that he spotted on the plane			0
' in spite of the gates , i was allowed access without any question , ' he said			0
the project 's website states , ' @entity13 provides a fascinating window into one of the greatest structural changes of the 21st - century , the rise of the upper middle class in the developing world			1
exploring the search for identity among this new strata of society , @entity1 takes us where they live : the shiny , newly - developed suburbs surrounding the new economic centers of the world			2
' in 2008 , @entity1 received three grants for his project but was faced with the dilemma of gaining access to the suburban homes			1
after sending numerous letters asking for permission to photograph , he received some disheartening responses			0
play room : this is a photo of a suburban landscape in @entity119 in @entity17 , @entity69 @entity121 palace : this is a photo of a suburban home in @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity44 drive by shot : this is a photo of a suburban home garage in @entity129 in @entity20 , @entity130 all in a row : this is a photo of the @entity133 in @entity21 , @entity55 one day in @entity34 : this is a photo of a home in @entity61 in @entity34 , @entity57 ' responses ranged everywhere from no answer at all to " thank you for your request , we are reviewing it but we want final approval and full supervision , " and i realized that those restrictions would set the project in an entirely different and limited direction , ' he told @entity30			2
he decided to visit the homes , not as a photographer , but as an interested buyer			1
he went as far as to hire local residents to pretend to be his spouse or colleague			1
he would let his assistants so all the talking while he only had several minutes to shoot a few photos			1
' because the images were captured in this semi-clandestine way , there was nâ€™t much time reflect as i was working ; at most locations , i only had five or 10 minutes to shoot , ' he told @entity30			0
his website says of the project , ' his approach is best described as a combination of positively amusing and awkwardly eerie , as he documents a curious phenomenon that looks more and more like the constructed world of @entity167			0
' all @entity1 's photographs were taken with a slr camera without professional lighting			1
@entity1 attributes the quality of the photos to the fact that the homes have a sense of familiarity and are ' made to be easily captured			1
' ' there is a lot of uncertainty as the global economy expands and cultural borders continue to dissolve			0
people seek out common experience and comfort , and perhaps these model homes reflect pop culture as a uniting common denominator , ' @entity1 told @entity30			2
the artist also has an upcoming project called ' @entity190 ' which explores the relationship between the ever changing landscape and the society we live in			0
more information about @entity1 and his work can be found on his website			2
