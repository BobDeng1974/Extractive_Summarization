by @entity0 published : 18:11 est , 30 june 2012 updated : 18:11 est , 30 june 2012 @entity2 soldiers in @entity3 claim that new tactics are preventing them shooting at the @entity5 until they have been fired at themselves – resulting in an alarming rise in the number of casualties			1
the troops say they have had to change their procedures as part of @entity13 - led efforts to cut down on the number of civilians being wounded , but the new approach has made them more vulnerable			1
in the past three months , 11 @entity2 soldiers have been killed by enemy gunfire in @entity20 province , compared with just two in the same period last year			1
in the line of fire : @entity2 soldiers say a tactical change stopping them from firing first has left them at greater risk of death or injury while on patrol in @entity3 the @entity29 denied there has been any change in the rules of engagement for @entity2 troops			1
however , a spokesman for the multinational forces headed by @entity13 general @entity36 confirmed there had been a tactical review after which the @entity2 were told to alter their procedures			1
soldiers now say they are particularly vulnerable when they are manning checkpoints at road junctions or patrolling @entity5 heartlands such as the so - called ‘ green zone ’ , a densely vegetated river valley			1
in the past , they say , they could shoot first at armed insurgents but are now only allowed to return fire			2
one junior non-commissioned officer said : ‘ when i arrived in @entity20 , my officers said our tactics were going to change			1
‘ they said that if i saw somebody carrying a rifle or a rocket launcher , i should n’t fire at him			2
only if he shot at me or a member of my patrol , and i could see a muzzle flash from his rifle , could i use my weapon			2
‘ i was shocked and so were my mates			2
we are trained to close in and kill the enemy , not to let him stroll on , watch us and let him choose the best time to ambush us			0
‘ it has been hard to obey these orders while on patrol			0
there have been many occasions when we have come under fire from the @entity5 , who we ’ve seen following us through the green zone			0
‘ on previous tours , we would have engaged the enemy first to show them what we were made of			0
we ’re up for a fight but now we always have to back off			0
‘ it makes me question the point of us being here			0
‘ older guys like me have seen the tactics change over the years and 2012 is the hardest because we ’re taking so many backward steps			0
i really feel for the families of the guys who ’ve lost their lives , and i miss my mates who are dead			0
’ surge in casualties : @entity13 @entity86 @entity85 personnel carry a stretcher with a wounded @entity2 soldier from their helicopter into an ambulance in @entity91 conservative mp and former @entity94 officer @entity93 said : ‘ the @entity5 can move as they please , even when heavily armed , and we ’re not interfering with them			1
‘ currently there is a reluctance to engage and a preference for a policing approach			0
‘ soldiers i ’ve spoken to feel frustrated and vulnerable			2
the rise in fatal wounds from gunshots comes as no surprise			0
‘ i feel deeply for the soldiers placed in this perilous position			2
’ military sources say the timing of gen @entity36 ’s demands was unfortunate because the orders coincided with a tactical shift by the @entity5			0
it recently stepped up ambushes because of growing @entity2 success in thwarting mines and improvised explosive devices ( ieds )			1
change of strategy : general @entity36 , commander of the @entity119 gen @entity36 , commander of the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) , has also forbidden the firing of rockets into mud - brick compounds housing ordinary @entity3 but also used by the @entity5			0
soldiers say tactics have changed dramatically since @entity2 forces arrived in @entity20 in 2006			1
back then , they could engage anyone who posed a threat – whether or not they were armed			0
but in 2009 , @entity13 general @entity131 , who was then @entity119 ’s commanding officer , ordered @entity2 soldiers only to engage insurgents who were bearing arms			1
gen @entity36 ordered a tactical review after negotiations between @entity119 and the @entity3 government			0
the country ’s president , @entity138 , has criticised @entity119 for causing civilian casualties , with the @entity141 estimating that more than 3,000 were killed last year			1
an @entity119 spokesman said : ‘ we have conducted a number of conferences devoted to the reduction of civilian casualties			2
‘ these conferences have been a forum for passing tactics , techniques and procedures to the operational level and into practice			0
‘ gen @entity36 recently ensured all commanders reviewed and certified their troops on the updated tactical directives , with an emphasis on the prevention of civilian casualties			1
’ the @entity29 said : ‘ there has been no change to @entity2 rules of engagement , and our forces continue to have the freedom they require to operate in support of increasingly effective @entity3 security forces			1
‘ we have always been very clear , as has @entity119 , that our troops go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties			1
‘ recent amendments to the @entity119 tactical directive reflect that commitment , but in no way limit the use of fire support in situations of self - defence			0

11 @entity2 soldiers gunned down in @entity20 in past three months , compared to two in the same period last year
troops say they changed rules of engagement in *response* to @entity13 efforts to cut civilian shootings
