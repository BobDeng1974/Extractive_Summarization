morbidly obese workers should be treated as ‘ disabled ’ by their bosses , one of @entity3 ’s top lawyers ruled yesterday			0
@entity4 , advocate general at the @entity5 , said that ‘ extreme , severe or morbid ’ obesity prevents staff from a full ‘ participation in professional life ’			1
mr @entity4 ’s ruling on a test case at the @entity13 court could lead to bosses across @entity3 – including in @entity15 – being banned from discriminating against fat employees			1
controversial : @entity4 ( left ) , advocate general at the @entity5 , said that ' extreme , severe or morbid ' obesity prevents staff from a full ' participation in professional life ' ( file picture right ) the @entity17 was asked to rule on a case brought by 25st child - minder @entity23 , who was sacked by a local authority in @entity26 for being unable to perform basic duties due to his size			1
the council , @entity31 , claimed the child - minder was so fat that he required help from a colleague to tie up children ’s shoelaces			1
mr @entity4 found @entity37 law does not prohibit discrimination specifically on the grounds of obesity			2
but he said those with extreme obesity , classified as having a body mass index ( @entity44 ) of more than 40 , could be considered disabled			0
a healthy @entity44 score , which is based on weight and height , is between 18 and 25			0
he said : ‘ if obesity has reached such a degree that it plainly hinders participation in professional life , then this can be a disability			1
’ he added that just because obesity is ‘ self - inflicted ’ it is not any less worthy of being classed as a ‘ disability ’ than other afflictions			0
although his judgment is not binding , it will be used by the @entity5 as a basis for deciding whether mr @entity23 ’s obesity is a disability under @entity37 law , and whether his employer was guilty of discrimination by dismissing him			2
and if the @entity5 stick to mr @entity4 ’s ruling , it could result in widespread changes to workplace disability laws			1
@entity70 , of the @entity71 , said : ‘ if this opinion becomes the @entity5 ’s ruling , then the law is either an ass or barking mad			2
to give morbidly obese people the right to sue their employers if they become so fat that they can not do the job they have signed up to do is beyond belief			0
the mind boggles as to the likely cost to employers if the @entity5 decides to accept this opinion			0
’ decision : @entity4 ruled on a case involving 25 - stone child - minder @entity86 , who was sacked by a local council in @entity26 because he was unable to perform ' basic duties ' @entity90 , an employment law expert at @entity91 , said : ‘ it will be interesting to see how the @entity15 courts interpret this opinion as it seems to take us a little further down the road to obesity being recognised as a disability			1
‘ if being obese means that an individual can not perform the essential duties of their role and this condition is likely to be long - term , then the duty to make reasonable adjustments probably kicks in , even if there is no underlying cause or illness			2
‘ this could mean that employers could find themselves under a legal obligation to make adjustments such as providing car park spaces close to the workplace entrance for obese employees , providing special desks ... or possibly even ensuring that healthy meal options are provided at their staff canteen			0
‘ employers will certainly be looking at this opinion closely because the repercussions could be significant			0

@entity4 said the obese can not participate fully in professional life
@entity5 advocate general made ruling on case involving 25st child - minder @entity23 who was unable to perform basic duties
local authority in @entity26 said he could not bend down to tie shoelaces
