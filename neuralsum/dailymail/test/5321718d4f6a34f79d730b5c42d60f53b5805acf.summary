a mother sat in anguish yesterday as she heard how her two children died because of three blunders by staff maintaining a gas boiler at the holiday hotel			1
@entity7 listened intently as the details of how they were killed by fumes at the four - star @entity12 hotel were outlined at an inquest			1
@entity14 , seven , and her brother @entity15 , six , were overcome by carbon monoxide that leaked from a faulty boiler as a ‘ happy and relaxed ’ family holiday in @entity12 ended in ‘ appalling tragedy ’			1
@entity20 , seven , ( left ) and her brother @entity21 , six , ( right ) died from carbon monoxide poisoning during a holiday in @entity12 in october 2006			1
their father @entity24 – who is mrs @entity7 ’s ex-husband – and his partner @entity26 fell into a coma and were close to death when they were found the next morning by a maid , along with the bodies of the children			1
the couple recovered after emergency treatment			2
yesterday , @entity35 , 44 , sat in silence as the details of her children ’s final hours were related to the inquest jury at @entity40 , nine years after the tragedy			1
scenes of the youngsters playing together were shown on a large screen as the background was outlined			0
commenting on the inquest – which has been delayed partly because of ongoing legal proceedings – coroner @entity48 said : ‘ the family of these children have waited a long , long time for this day			1
’ the jury was told how mr @entity24 had booked the £ 2,000 holiday to the @entity55 island with @entity56			1
the family were put in a bungalow at the @entity59			0
on the third day of the trip in october 2006 , @entity20 felt ‘ unwell ’ and @entity21 tripped and fell after feeling dizzy			1
mr @entity48 said they went to bed at 11.30pm			0
in the night mr @entity24 , now 46 , went to his daughter when she was heard crying and @entity64 , who is now his wife , went to @entity21 who was ‘ whimpering ’			1
their father , @entity24 , and his girlfriend @entity26 , ( together , left ) who he has since married , were also almost killed by the fumes			1
pictured right is the children 's ' mother @entity7 , with her husband @entity71 the bungalow at the four - star @entity59 in @entity12 , where @entity21 and @entity20 had been staying with their father and his girlfriend the bungalow is taped off and examined following the discovery of the children 's bodies in october 2006 tests showed the family had suffered carbon monoxide poisoning			1
the cause was identified as the gas - fired hot water boiler in an outhouse next to the bedrooms			0
@entity88 , a boiler expert hired to investigate by @entity56 , discovered the boiler covered in rust from water leakage			0
he identified a series of blunders , the inquest heard			1
the boiler had been installed without a ‘ chimney ’ or flue to take out unwanted fumes			2
second , a ‘ protection device ’ designed to cut out the boiler if it overheated had been disabled as late as the day before the tragedy , to avoid a worker having to come and relight the boiler when it was tripped off , the inquest heard			2
third , a crude hole in the outhouse internal wall enabled fumes to pass into the bedrooms			2
the hole has been made for air conditioning pipes , but had not been sealed			0
there was also a water leak which caused the boiler to work longer and dangerous gases to build up			0
the leak should have been obvious from the rust but it was not fixed			0
mr @entity88 said tests showed a ‘ massive ’ concentration of carbon monoxide and the children were hardest hit because their room was closest to the source			0
commenting on the workmanship , mr @entity48 asked : ‘ was it bodged or botched ? ’ mr @entity88 replied : ‘ you would say it was bodged			0
’ the inquest was told problems with the boiler were first reported five months earlier			2
boilers at the hotel had been installed about eight years before the tragedy and evidence indicated dangerously faulty boilers throughout the site			0
the family were initially not supposed to have been staying in the bungalow but were switched to number 112 because the room they were allocated was unsuitable			0
the inquest heard 112 had become available because the previous occupants had become unwell and were detained in hospital for tests and treatment			2
no further details were revealed			0
