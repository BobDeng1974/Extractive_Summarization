when people move house they often refer to ‘ entering a new chapter of their lives ’ or ‘ turning a new leaf ’			2
for @entity8 and @entity9 , either expression could n’t be more apt , as the couple are now leaving a former library they have lived in for almost 40 years			1
and it ’s not just any old library			1
@entity15 , their @entity17 home , was built by the most eminent and fashionable architect of the time , sir @entity20 , the man who also created the @entity21 , the @entity22 at @entity23 and the @entity24 , all in @entity25			1
he was commissioned to build the memorial library for @entity28 mp @entity27 by his widow @entity29 in 1862 , and it was used by the town until 1958 and later turned into offices			1
striking : the @entity34 revival property 's clock tower , right , and left , the large octagonal atrium it then faced demolition in the 1970s before locals moved to preserve the building , and quantity surveyor @entity40 saw an opportunity to save the structure while turning it into his family home			2
but now , in their mid to late 80s , the pair are finding the huge , 2,800 sq ft two - storey home right in the centre of the historic town of @entity28 , @entity50 , just a little too much to cope with , and are looking to downsize while staying in the town			1
@entity15 is on the market for offers in excess of £ 1 million			1
‘ it was extraordinarily run - down and had been empty for six or seven years , ’ says the @entity56 ’ daughter , @entity55			2
with her brother and family friends , she helped her parents with the extensive restoration , which was to take five years after they bought it in 1976			0
sir @entity20 was commissioned to build @entity15 in 1862			1
@entity64 , the octagonal atrium ‘ there was a tree growing in the area that is now the atrium			0
my father had to design the new roof and decided on an octagonal glass one that floods the atrium with light			0
indeed , we ’ve always considered it as our internal garden , ’ says @entity55 , a teacher , whose former husband did much of the carpentry work on the renovation			0
creator : architect sir @entity20 the room she ’s referring to is the magnificent 36ft - high octagonal reception room , which has a stunning balcony running around it on the first floor , and a large fish pond as its centrepiece on the ground floor			1
‘ yes , that created a lot of debate within the family , ’ says @entity55			2
‘ some of us wanted it to be a small swimming pool but my father won that one			0
but lots of our children have ended up in it anyway , so i suppose it ’s doubled up in its use			0
’ @entity55 ’s father kept a weekly diary of his work restoring the library , which he sent to his daughter while she was away at university , and later wrote a book about his work , @entity109 , which is published by @entity111			2
the flexible layout could accommodate four bedrooms			0
there ’s an l - shaped kitchen / diner , four bathrooms , a large first - floor lounge , and various snugs , nooks and crannies , as well as a clock tower and a fabulous 18ft - high entrance hall with original vaulted ceiling , pillars and tessellated tiled floor			0
‘ that ’s my favourite place , ’ says @entity55 , who also lives in @entity28			1
‘ the ceiling is incredible			0
’ the house is at the heart of @entity28 , on the @entity130 and now part of the @entity132			1
the town ’s world - famous bonfire celebrations happen right outside the front door , with the various societies parading by every november 5			0
‘ that has always been one of the highlights of the year and we have a lot of friends then , ’ laughs @entity55			0
@entity143 £ 1 million @entity28 , @entity50 @entity144 unique features former library built by sir @entity20 , octagonal atrium with balcony and fish pond , clock tower with bell ‘ and it goes on very late , so that was always a party night , but , because of its size and where it is , the house has always been a big party venue			1
’ a bookshelf , two tables and two librarian stools are all that ’s left of the original library , and now the property is ripe for another renovation as it ’s in need of updating			2
‘ it ’s a real one - off , ’ says @entity55			0
‘ we ’ve made it a family tradition to visit other @entity20 buildings to see what else he created , and we ’ve found our tiles and some wrought iron work and certain colours he used at his more well - known buildings at our home , and that has made it very special			1
‘ but now it ’s time for someone else to put their mark on what is one of the landmark buildings in the town			2
