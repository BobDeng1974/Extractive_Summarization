as the man charged with ensuring the finer details of @entity4 ’s attacking game are in working order , it would have been understandable to find @entity6 in a much darker mood than he was on tuesday			1
three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against @entity11 , @entity6 bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at @entity16			2
with 11 tries in four @entity20 games so far — and @entity21 to come on saturday in a game that could see @entity4 break their run of three successive runners - up finishes by winning the championship — @entity6 believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope			1
@entity4 coach @entity6 wants @entity4 to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points ‘ ninety - nine per cent of the things were very good , ’ said the @entity36 winner turned skills coach			1
‘ obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with			2
‘ at international level , the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities			2
you might not get five or six like we had on the weekend			2
‘ we need to make sure we convert those into points			0
the players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water			0
it is all about us sticking to what we are doing , because it is working			0
’ @entity55 looks on as his @entity4 side prepares for saturday 's crucial clash with @entity21 @entity59 flanker @entity58 will want to see some action during the crucial @entity20 clash with three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers @entity67 , it is hard to argue , even considering their no - show in @entity70			1
@entity4 ’s build - up play was , at times , exceptional against @entity11 , even if their decision - making with the try line in view bordered on the dim - witted			1
@entity55 names his side to face @entity21 on thursday , when @entity79 duo @entity78 and @entity80 appear certain to be in the line - up for the first time in this championship			1
the @entity84 made countless errors in dispatching @entity86 on sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match , which kicks off last at 5pm and will see @entity4 knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of @entity93 ’s reign			2
@entity94 and @entity95 must be at their creative best to defeat a strong - tackling @entity84 midfield @entity4 ’s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing @entity86 as @entity67 narrowly beat @entity21 in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp			1
many believe the staggered kick - off times to suit television undermine the tournament			2
@entity6 added : ‘ we do n’t control it			0
it ’s very tough because international matches are brutal			0
and when you are travelling a lot of the time , that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery			0
it impedes you a bit			0
’ @entity4 will take comfort from knowing if @entity67 run up a big score against @entity11 to leave them needing to chase the game against @entity21 , they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons			1
@entity125 sets sights on @entity21 following @entity11 win @entity4 practice their scrummaging during the training session ahead of their upcoming physical battle @entity94 , playing because of injuries to @entity132 and @entity133 at the start of the tournament , has been a revelation			1
he is the championship ’s leading try - scorer with four in four games and , at 23 , looks to the manner born			2
his performances at outside centre have been so good he is now regularly compared to the prince of @entity145 centres @entity143 , and the @entity147 three - quarter is confident of @entity4 ’s chances , despite saturday ’s missed opportunities			1
captain @entity150 knows his side face a tough test against the @entity84 if they want to claim a crucial win @entity4 duo @entity154 ( left ) and @entity150 will be hoping they can lift the coveted trophy ‘ it was frustrating and a lot of negatives have been drawn from that game ( @entity11 ) , but as a team we created a lot , ’ he said			1
‘ we feel we have come on massively in terms of putting defences under stress			0
‘ we ’re happy with what we have created			0
now it is just a case of doing the last bit			0
the easier bit is the finishing			0
it ’s something we ’ll work on			0
i do n’t think there is any need to panic			0
’ @entity125 @entity4 v @entity11 - extended highlights @entity177 , who missed games because of injury , is a vital player for @entity4 and his return is a real boost			1

@entity4 can break their run of three successive runners - up finishes
they face @entity21 on saturday and could win the championship with *victory*
