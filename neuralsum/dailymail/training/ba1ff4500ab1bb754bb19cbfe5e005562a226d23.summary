@entity21 , gin and vodka have replaced sherry and brandy as our favourite drinks at @entity7 time it showed that we are also less likely to make traditional @entity7 food like @entity29 puddings			1
according to recent records , we have resorted to ordering takeout curry and pizza rather than making festive holiday dinner favourites like custard			1
and it wo n't surprise you that compared to the 1990s , we talk about calories twice as much as we used to			2
words do n't necessarily always translate to actions as our most talked about food item at @entity7 - as well as the rest of the year - is cake			2
the study also found that we have resorted to ordering takeout curry and pizza rather than making festive holiday dinner favourites like custard initial findings from the study revealed tea is our nation 's favourite drink , spoken an average of 255 times per million words			1

the nation 's favourite drink is tea , and was spoken an average of 255 times per million words the study shows we talk about family almost twice as much as we used to , as it seems that the concept of family is more noticeable in @entity73 @entity72 speech today than it was two decades ago			0

' this suggests @entity7 may be even happier this year - but perhaps this can be attributed to all the talk of champagne ! ' the team at the @entity98 are looking for people to send in their everyday conversations for a fee to aid the study further			2
professor @entity103 , from the @entity104 to @entity105 ( @entity106 ) at @entity98 , said : ' we need to gather hundreds , if not thousands , of conversations to create a full spoken corpus , so we can continue to analyse the way language has changed over the last 20 years			0
' this is an ambitious project and we are calling for people to send us mp3 files of their everyday , informal conversations in exchange for a small payment to help our team to delve deeper into spoken language and to shed more light on the way our spoken language changes over time			0
