by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 21:04 est , 8 december 2013 @entity3 : 21:04 est , 8 december 2013 hundreds of people with lung cancer have been diagnosed and given potentially lifesaving surgery as a result of a hard - hitting advertising campaign , say experts			1
anyone with a cough lasting more than three weeks was urged to see their doctor during the six - week @entity14 campaign in the summer			1
it led to around 700 extra patients being diagnosed with lung cancer - many at an early stage – and 300 more patients getting surgery which gives them the best chance of prolonged survival			1
advice : the six - week @entity14 on @entity14 campaign urged anyone with a cough lasting more than three weeks to see their doctor ( file picture ) fewer than one in seven of the 38,000 new cases every year are diagnosed early enough for effective treatment by surgery , radiotherapy or chemotherapy			1
although survival rates for other forms of the disease have significantly improved in the last 30 years , they have remained almost static for lung cancer – the biggest cancer killer			2
on average patients will live for just five months after diagnosis compared to nearly 10 years for cancers affecting the bowel and breast			0
dr @entity43 , lung cancer expert and consultant in respiratory medicine at the @entity47 , said ‘ we are starting to see a dramatic change in potentially curative treatments for lung cancer			0
‘ as a result of the @entity14 on @entity14 campaign we ’ve seen as much progress , particularly in the proportion of patients having an operation for their lung cancer , in those three months as in the previous two years			1
’ pleased : dr @entity59 , chief executive of @entity62 , said it was ' great news ' the campaign had raised awareness of lung cancer symptoms the £ 1.8 million campaign is part of a government drive to improve early cancer diagnosis in the hope of saving an extra 5,000 lives a year by 2015			1
adverts on the tv , radio and in newspapers and magazines in august urged people to go to the @entity80 if they had a cough lasting longer than three weeks			0
an analysis of the results by @entity62 charity found almost 10 per cent more people - around 700 - were diagnosed with lung cancer than in the same months the previous year			2
around 400 more patients had their lung cancer picked up at an early stage – the earlier cancer is detected the more likely treatment is to be successful			2
there was also a significant fall in the proportion of people diagnosed at a late stage			0
around 300 more of those diagnosed received surgery which is vital for better survival			1
the successful results mean the campaign is likely to run again next year			0
dr @entity59 , chief executive of @entity62 , said ‘ it is great news that this campaign has raised awareness of lung cancer symptoms among those most at risk of the disease			2
‘ by acting quickly if you notice a possible symptom , you can give yourself the best chance of survival			0
in many cases it wo n’t be cancer , but it is better to be sure and , if it is cancer , to detect it earlier rather than later			0
‘ dr @entity120 , chief executive of the @entity121 , said ‘ current lung cancer survival rates in the @entity123 are sadly very low , and it is an area in which we lag considerably behind the rest of @entity127 and the @entity128			1
‘ naturally , we wo n’t know for sure until subsequent years whether this impact will be a lasting one , but these very positive early indications seem to confirm that such awareness campaigns can make real tangible differences to people ’s lives			0
‘ coming when new figures revealed lung cancer surgery rates to be at a record high , the @entity14 of @entity138 findings tentatively suggest that we might finally be turning a corner in tackling a disease that has been killing too many for too long			1
’ @entity141 , @entity142 at @entity143 , said ‘ until recently a lung cancer patient in @entity145 was nearly 70 per cent more likely to survive their disease for at least five years than if they lived in @entity143			0
’ professor @entity149 , director of health and wellbeing at @entity151 , said ‘ to see such encouraging results from the first national @entity14 on cancer lung campaign is very reassuring			2
‘ we are now looking to re-run the campaign in 2014 which we hope will improve survival for even more patients			0
