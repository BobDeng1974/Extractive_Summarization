the deep web is a hive of illegal activity , rife with child pornography , drug deals and human trafficking			1
but because it is ' buried ' so deep it is considered out of the reach of mainstream search engines and many law enforcement agencies - until now			0
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) has developed an engine dubbed @entity13 - a combination of memory and index - that not only scours content on this so - called dark net , but also identifies subtle patterns in activity			1
@entity11 said : ' today 's web searches use a centralised , one - size - fits - all approach that searches the internet with the same set of tools for all queries			1
' [ but ] common search practices miss information in the deep web - the parts of the web not indexed by standard commercial search engines - and ignore shared content across pages			0
' @entity13 was designed to overcome these challenges by extending ' the reach of current search capabilities and quickly and thoroughly organise subsets of information based on individual interests			1
' the dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media			1
most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites , unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines			0
this has been likened to dragging a net across the surface of the sea , missing much of the information in the depths			0
the dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods , but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity			1
the @entity81 website , and its successor that were recently shut down , was used to sell drugs in exchange for @entity85			0
other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs , hacked information and credit card numbers			1
the @entity81 used an underground computer network known as the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) , which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users			0
it uses numerous layers of security and encryption , hiding the ip address and the activity of the user			0
it looks behind standard search results for patterns , links and similar behaviours			2
the software scours all aspects of the web - including those hidden in the dark net - to create data maps that might reveal clues about illegal activity			1
in particular , @entity11 wants to use @entity13 to uncover human trafficking rings by searching for patterns in the number of online sex adverts being posted from certain regions , or porn sites featuring the same email addresses or phone numbers			1
these patterns could reveal links that human investigators could miss , explained @entity32			2
' we 're envisioning a new paradigm for search that would tailor indexed content , search results and interface tools to individual users and specific subject areas , and not the other way around , ' said @entity137 , @entity11 program manager			2
' by inventing better methods for interacting with and sharing information , we want to improve search for everybody and individualise access to information			0
ease of use for non-programmers is essential			0
' the @entity13 program gets its name from a hypothetical device described in ' as we may think ' - a 1945 article for the @entity152			2
it was written by @entity154 , director of the @entity156 @entity155 ( @entity155 ) during @entity157 in the article , @entity13 was described as an analog computer that would supplement human memory			2
it would store and automatically cross-reference all of the user 's books , records and other information			0
this cross-referencing , which mr @entity154 called ' associative indexing ' , would let users quickly search large amounts of information , and gain insights from it			2
targeting the deep web is also an initiative being developed in the @entity174			2
the @entity13 program gets its name from a hypothetical device described in a 1945 article for the @entity152			0
in the article ( pictured ) , @entity13 was described as an analog computer that would supplement human memory to store and automatically cross-reference all of the user 's books , records and other information in december , prime minister @entity183 ( pictured ) said a specialist unit was being set up to hunt down paedophiles using the dark net to share child pornography			1
the @entity188 and the @entity189 ( @entity189 ) will use advanced technology to trace ' digital footprints ' of criminals in december , the @entity174 government said a specialist unit was being set up to hunt down paedophiles using the dark net to share child pornography			1
the @entity188 and the @entity189 ( @entity189 ) will use advances in analysing images and communications to trace the ' digital footprints ' left by the users who share them			2
@entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 will use proposed digital fingerprints , or hash values , of thousands of known child sex abuse images to prevent them being shared			1
@entity204 has also developed new technology that allows child abuse videos to be identified and blocked			0
@entity203 , @entity204 and @entity212 have also said they will investigate ways of placing restrictions within their browsers to block people from accessing child pornography			1
@entity204 and @entity203 have both also introduced a number of changes to their search functions globally			0
@entity204 claims to have seen a five-fold reduction in the number of searches for child abuse images since these changes were made			0
however , these changes are thought to be partly responsible for driving much of the trade in child pornography into the dark net			1
prime minister @entity183 said the new unit is aimed at ' shining a light on the web 's darkest corners ' as he announced a package of measures to tackle online child abuse			0
the @entity188 estimates that around 20,000 people from the @entity174 use secret or encrypted networks each day			1
the dark net consists of a network of encoded websites that sit behind the publicly available websites and can not be found with normal search engines			1
it came to prominence in 2012 when the @entity246 made a series of raids on @entity81 - an online marketplace described as the ' @entity250 for illegal drugs '			0
figures compiled by the @entity188 suggest that use of the dark net rose by two thirds in 2012			1
hidden capabilities that let users email and host file storage through encrypted and anonymous networks are provided by services the @entity92 ( @entity92 )			0
@entity92 users currently represent 0.18 per cent of the total number of internet uses in the @entity174			2
however , in a recent investigation , @entity189 and the @entity188 were able to track down a @entity174 man who had been maintaining chat rooms and websites in the @entity267 and @entity268 that were used to share child pornography around the world			1
he was also offering advice to other paedophiles about how to hide their behaviour and was using software to keep himself anonymous			0
analysis by experts at @entity189 allowed them to trace the man and he was later sentenced to three years in prison for making and distributing indecent images of children .			0

@entity13 was designed by the @entity11
it scours the so - called dark net to create data maps of links and patterns
this identifies associations between sites and criminal groups , for example
it follows the *announcement* of a @entity174 - based unit set up to track down dark net users sharing child pornography over secret networks
experts will use digital fingerprints left on dark net to hunt paedophiles
