doctors surgeries will be upgraded using a new £ 1 billion fund paid for by bank fines , @entity0 announced today			1
the chancellor said the cash would pay for a ' permanent improvement in gp services ' and comes on top of an extra £ 2 billion injection into the @entity12 budget set to be formally announced on wednesday			1
the funding will allow patients to undergo chemotherapy and dialysis closer to home			0
but @entity25 's shadow chancellor @entity26 this morning promised to spend an extra £ 2.5billion on top of the government 's £ 3 billion cash injection			1
speaking on the @entity31 ’s @entity30 show this morning mr @entity0 insisted that increasing funding for the @entity12 was only possible because the economy was growing			2
he said : ‘ because we have a strong economy and we 've got the public finances under control , we can afford to put £ 2 billion into the front - line of the @entity12 , across the @entity39			2
’ he added : ‘ indeed i can tell you we can go further and use those fines that have been paid by the banks for a permanent improvement in gp services			1
' this is a down payment on the @entity12 's own long - term plan			2
’ the new money for gps from bank fines amounts to £ 250 million a year for four years			1
the other £ 2 billion comes from £ 1.3 billion in new cash from the @entity51 – with £ 700 million from @entity52 ‘ reallocated ’ to the frontline @entity12			1
mr @entity0 ( right ) speaks with nurse @entity53 ( second left ) , accompanied by health secretary @entity54 ( left ) and @entity12 chief @entity55 , at the @entity56 in @entity57 today the chancellor visited a hospital this morning seeking to counter political attacks on his conservative party 's handling of the health service six months before an election mr @entity26 said a @entity66 plan for £ 3 billion injection into the @entity12 was “ crisis money ”			1
he said : ‘ the conservatives wasted £ 3bn on their reorganisation of the @entity12			2
so , this is a typical @entity66 pattern - a winter crisis and then crisis money coming after it			0
‘ the question is : is this a one off ? or is this going to be actual long - term investment in the nurses and doctors we need			0
‘ @entity25 has said we will have a tax on high value properties , £ 2.5bn over and above @entity66 spending plans for 20,000 more nurses , doctors , care workers too			0
we will save the @entity12			0
as you can see the @entity90 are really putting the @entity12 in danger			0
’ no 10 is acutely conscious that despite @entity93 ’s rock - bottom personal ratings , the @entity12 remains the only policy area in which @entity25 consistently polls ahead of the conservatives			1
the expected announcement in wednesday ’s speech comes after days of behind - the - scenes jostling between the @entity90 and @entity100 to claim credit for the @entity12 funding boost , with @entity100 health minister @entity100 publicly calling for more resources to prevent a ‘ crash ’ in services over the winter			1
it had previously been rumoured that the @entity12 boost would amount to only £ 1 billion			1

mr @entity0 ( right ) and shadow chancellor @entity26 speak on the @entity31 's the @entity121 this morning mr @entity26 told @entity30 that @entity25 would spend £ 2.5billion more than the @entity90 over the next @entity122 mr @entity0 will claim in the statement – his last major pre-election commons setpiece other than @entity125 – that his handling of the economy has enabled him to free up extra resources for the health service			1
‘ you ca n’t have a strong @entity12 without a strong economy to pay for it			0
if you do n’t have a long - term plan for the economy , you do n’t have a plan for the future of the @entity12 , ’ he is expected to say , adding : ‘ we have both			2
it ’s because our economy is growing , and we ’ve kept a tight control on the finances , that we can do more for the @entity12			0
’ the chancellor is also planning to make the political point that extra @entity12 funding should be allied to the more efficient management which he claims would be ensured by a @entity66 administration			1
‘ this will support the day - to - day work of our incredible nurses , doctors and other @entity12 staff ; but it is also a down - payment on the future of our health service			0
‘ this new money will be used to buy the new facilities and services that will help transform the @entity12 so it becomes more efficient for taxpayers and effective for patients			2
’ mr @entity0 will also claim credit for the fact that ‘ the @entity39 economy is growing faster than any other major economy in the world ’ – but will also repeat @entity166 ’s warning earlier this month about the risks of a new global downturn hitting the @entity39 economy			0
@entity25 fought back last night , with @entity170 , the party ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury , saying : ‘ this week @entity0 will have to admit that he has broken his promises			0
‘ he has failed to deliver rising living standards and that failure is why he ’s also set to break his promise to balance the books by next year			0
‘ we need a plan to save and transform our health service too			0
@entity25 will raise an additional £ 2.5 billion a year , on top of @entity66 spending plans , for an extra 20,000 nurses and 8,000 gps			2
