they have two children , @entity38 , four , and @entity39 , 18 months the pastor , who grew up on the @entity42 estate in @entity43 , @entity44 , said : ' i was n't far off being an antichrist - i just did n't care at all			1
' i genuinely felt dead on the inside and did n't feel anything apart from hate and anger and guilt			2
' where i was knocking about and the people i was hanging round crime was everywhere and everybody was doing it , so it was only a matter of time before i got involved			0
' he said : ' i got into drugs like cannabis , lsd and solvents and when the drugs trend moved on to the rave scene and ecstasy came about i got into that			0
' we were going out to all the illegal raves taking drugs , selling drugs so i could cover whatever i was taking			0
' then my drug habit escalated and with that the come downs were so bad i would smoke heroin to help me feel more normal			0
' ' at worst when i was around 16 i was using an 8th of heroin a day which is around £ 250 to £ 300 so started debt collecting for dealers to fund my habit			0
' a friend recruited him to steal a car and be the driver for an armed robbery at a wages depot but after the raid , one of their accomplices turned them in to police when he was held on a serious assault charge			1
mr @entity7 is now senior pastor at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 - quite a change from the confines of @entity30 @entity7 , pictured front , now gives talks about his experiences and works with young people as part of his ministry mr @entity7 was sent to @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , where he set out to be ' the best kind of bad ' he could possibly be			1
he said : ' even in prison i would go looking for opportunities to cement my reputation			0
' i would do violent things for no reason - i put a lad in hospital after setting about him with a snooker ball in a sock because i thought he looked at me in the wring way and i even assaulted a prison officer who i thought was being disrespectful			2
' he continued to sell drugs and spent time in segregation for the assaults			0
but an encounter in the welding workshop , where another prisoner was signing people up to a meeting in the prison chapel - which meant an afternoon out of his cell as well as free coffee and biscuits			2
mr @entity7 said : ' there were two nuns and i gave them a load of abuse but they were very patient and seemed to listen to what i had to say			1
' he said the nuns responded with compassion and were ' love bombs '			0
' i thought i would never have the capacity to feel any kind of love again - but the way they treated me stopped me in my tracks			2
' that night he said a prayer and vowed to devote his life to @entity25 if he would take away his demons			0
@entity7 and @entity143 on their wedding day in 2005 - only five years after his release from prison after serving a sentence for armed robbery the next morning , he threw away his tobacco and cannabis after trying to smoke it made him feel sick , and began walking away from fights			1
he was visited in prison by @entity155 - who would eventually become his father - in - law			1
mr @entity7 said : ' he spoke to me and said that the church would be a really good place for me to go after i was released			1

mr @entity155 said : " @entity7 is not the same person that went into prison for sure			1

it 's a radical change			0
' he 's enhanced all our community work - especially the drug awareness course			2
' it 's one thing getting information about a subject but it 's another thing when it comes from someone who has experienced it			0
