@entity0 was the surprise inclusion in the @entity3 side , coming in for his first start in 20 months			1
the @entity5 has twice beaten testicular cancer and only returned as a substitute last month			0
but , in fairness to the 31 - year - old , he was @entity3 ’s best player - not that he had much competition			0
@entity0 was not expected to start after twice surviving cancer , but was the visitors ' best player @entity0 gets up to challenge @entity15 during a good performance , but one that ended in defeat history was on @entity21 ’s side			1
the last two @entity23 managers – @entity25 and @entity26 – both enjoyed @entity28 victories in their second match in charge and the @entity31 kept alive that quirk of footballing fate			2
so whoever is the new boss at the @entity36 next season can only hope the @entity37 are game no 2			0
@entity23 's new manager won a derby in his second game in charge , just like his two predecssors @entity3 suffered an injury scare during the warm - up when emergency centre - back @entity46 limped off towards the dressing - room , although he did start the game			1
@entity49 , though , had no recognised defenders on the bench			0
however , rumours that coach @entity52 was set to start in the middle of the backline were probably wide of the mark			0
@entity46 's warm - up injury led to rumours of @entity52 filling in , but the @entity58 recovered @entity59 hardly helped in sparing @entity60 the gauntlet of hate from the home fans			1
the head coach started the former @entity23 midfielder at left - back , ensuring every time he took a throw - in supporters in the front row would vacate their seat and hiss insults in his ear			1
at left - back on the opposite flank was @entity75 , formerly of @entity3			2
however , a barely - memorable seven appearances in the @entity77 meant he avoided such scorn from the @entity3			0
@entity60 was not protected from the @entity23 fans ' ire , positioned by @entity59 at left back @entity60 was returning to face his former club after departing to join rivals @entity3 last summer both sets of supporters were united in the 17th minute as they applauded as one in tribute of @entity3 fans @entity88 and @entity89 who were killed when flight @entity90 was shot down above @entity92 last summer			1
@entity23 fans subsequently helped to raise nearly £ 33,000 in their memory and rivalries were forgotten during the minute - long tribute .			2

@entity0 was an *unexpected* inclusion , but performed well
@entity21 continued @entity23 's new managers ' *winning* *tradition*
@entity59 left @entity60 *exposed* to @entity23 hate at left back
