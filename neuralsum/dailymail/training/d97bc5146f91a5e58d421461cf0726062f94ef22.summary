historian @entity3 believes the legendary figure was actually @entity5 of @entity6 @entity2 did not rob from the rich to feed the poor in @entity8 , he was a freedom fighter attacking @entity10 invaders in @entity11 , a historian has claimed			1
the legendary figure , who is said to have resided in the @entity15 area , may have actually been @entity5 of @entity6 , according to historian @entity3			1
@entity5 conducted a guerrilla war against the @entity10 forces of @entity18 who invaded @entity20 in 1216			1
mr @entity3 has suggested that @entity5 led a band of archers who attacked the @entity10 forces in the forests of the @entity25 before the little - known 18 - month occupation by the @entity10 of a large part of @entity20 was finally thwarted			1
writing in the magazine @entity28 , mr @entity3 said : ' it ’s hard to find another contender for the @entity2 story from this age or afterwards who is both a hero and an outlaw			1
' in @entity5 we have both : a feted resistance fighter , loyally protecting the crown , but also , from @entity39 ’ perspective , an egregious outlaw defying the righteous rule of the imposed new regime			2
' the academic said that other contenders for the legend such as @entity46 were at the wrong time and were thieves and outlaws that lacked the hero status			0
he also said that @entity5 would have travelled to the @entity15 area because it was the main headquarters of the @entity20 army at the time			2
but mr @entity3 accepts that @entity5 could only be one of many inspirations for the famous story			1
' the most probable truth behind the @entity2 legend is that over time storytellers incorporated and conflated various characters from a range of stories and settled on the instantly recognisable name of @entity2 as the woodsman			2
' @entity66 , @entity67 at @entity68 , which manages @entity69 , said : ' @entity2 was a man of the people and his legend is shared today throughout the world , so challenges can come and go , but @entity15 will always celebrate its legendary association with the world 's most famous outlaw and continue to conserve the precious remnants of @entity8 where he once roamed			2
' it is not the first time that historians have speculated on the originator of the @entity2 story			0
in 2006 , @entity84 said the medieval outlaw was actually a @entity86 freedom fighter who never set foot in @entity15			0
@entity88 , with @entity89 as @entity90 , famously depicted @entity2 as @entity2 @entity84 said the folk hero and his band of merry men would have carried out their thieving in the @entity95 , a primeval forest in @entity86 in the 11th century , more than a hundred years before the @entity20 @entity2			0
the @entity20 @entity2 is first mentioned by name in the official documents for @entity99 of 1230 , where he is described as @entity101 fugitivis who has failed to appear in court			0
many believe him to be nobleman , the @entity103 , who was deprived of his lands by greedy churchmen			0
ancient stories tell how he even helped @entity107 reclaim the throne of @entity20 after his return from the @entity110			0
since then @entity88 and @entity1 have both portrayed the legend on the big screen .			0

historian @entity3 believes @entity2 was @entity5 of @entity6
@entity5 led a guerrilla war against @entity10 forces in 1216 using archers
