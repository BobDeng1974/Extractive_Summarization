by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 06:37 est , 4 march 2014 hundreds of rogue landlords in one @entity4 borough are illegally renting out ' beds in sheds ' to immigrants on an industrial scale			1
@entity9 chartered a plane with thermal imaging to fly over streets picking up heat and found four times more ' suspicious ' outbuildings than expected			1
aerial photos revealed that instead of 75 suspected illegal developments at the bottom of gardens or in garages , there were actually at least 319			1
welcome to @entity22 : this is a thermal image of a street in the @entity4 borough			0
at the bottom of the picture is a road , and then a row of houses with heat escaping from windows			1
the circled building is at the bottom of a garden , and is believed to be a illegally converted outbuilding housing immigrants caught : a spy in the sky aeroplane with thermal imaging was chartered to find conversions			2
they can be seen because sheds and garages are generally not insulated , but houses are , so heat is seen in blocks of yellow officials believe more than 1,000 people could be living in cramped and squalid conditions costing around £ 55 per week , because they can not afford a proper home			1
the results mean they are probably living there without planning permission or contributing any council tax			1
beds in sheds - ultra basic accommodation used by ' exploited ' immigrants paying reduced rents to rogue landlords who ignore planning laws - are believed to be an increasing problem nationwide , but especially in and around the capital			1
@entity9 flew over their borough at 3,379 feet between 9pm and midnight in january to gauge the scale of the problem			1
they were looking for buildings with escaping heat - a tell - tale sign that it is an uninsulated ' shed ' - as they are often hidden behind fences and can not be seen by passers - by			1
the council found one case with a person paying £ 55 a week to sleep on a mattress in a tiny room with two other people			2
concerns : although many of the outbuildings are habitable , some are described as being unsafe , with little or no heating , or do not comply with building or fire safety regulations the recent lift of immigration restrictions on @entity90 and @entity91 on january 1 has led to concerns that more beds in sheds will spring up			1
and there was also a net increase in migration to the @entity98 of 212,000 between september 2012 and september last year , according to @entity100 figures			0
@entity9 leader , councillor @entity101 , said : ' the pressures of migration in @entity4 , fuelled by recent waves of new arrivals from @entity106 , are creating new stresses on local authorities that we just have n't had to contend with before			1
' what was once thought even just 18 months ago to be a problem for the centre of big cities is now rippling out to the suburbs			0
' the beds in sheds phenomenon means there is a hidden community springing up in the back gardens of our cities - in our borough alone the thermal pictures we receive suggest there are four times as many as we first suspected			1
' these are people who use council services - like bin collections - but for whom we receive no extra funding			2
' in many cases the people in beds in sheds are at the bottom of a pyramid of exploitation			2
' but we get complaints from their neighbours that we can not ignore , and it is not fair on them that these houses should turn into cash cows for opportunist landlords			0
' illegal : councils want to crack down on rogue landlords turning sheds into illegal and often substandard living accommodation , such as this conversion in nearby @entity152 cut backs : people living in these illegal conversions use council services but do not contribute any council tax towards them - so town halls use thermal imaging to find them the planning enforcement department of @entity9 is now investigating 319 suspect properties identified from aerial photos			1
@entity163 , of @entity9 , added : ' it 's a @entity4 - wide issue			1
' some of these properties are okay , but in some places people are holed up and it 's an exercise to see how many people can fit into one property			0
' you can go from the quite nice and well looked after to places which are fairly grim and actually dangerous , with exposed electric wires			0
' the people in these buildings often come from abroad and they are at the bottom of a pyramid of exploitation			0
' a @entity91 man who was won the @entity180 - twice - has an illegal cabin in the back garden of his home that he rents out for as much as £ 10,000 a year			2
@entity184 , 46 , right , a former member of the @entity91 skydiving team , beat odds of one - in - 438 million when he picked up a £ 160,873 euromillions prize in march to add to the £ 1million sum he won in the @entity189 in september 2011			2
now a home he owns in @entity22 , north - west @entity4 , has been investigated by council staff after the cabin - which has a kitchen , toilet and bedroom - was discovered , pictured below			2
speaking at the time of his win , the property developer , who has lived in the @entity98 for 20 years , said : ' i 've always worked very hard and never spent more than i have so money has never been a major problem for me			0
' a neighbour , who did not wish to be identified , said a lot of people go to and from the property and claimed a fence was installed to hide the structure in the garden			0
harrow council served mr @entity184 with two planning enforcement notices			0
the house itself has been divided into four separate rooms , one of which is rented by @entity216 special educational needs teacher @entity215 , who lives in it with her two children , aged five and two			0
she said : ' @entity184 is a good landlord			0
he looks after us quite well			0
it was scary [ when the council came ]			0
i felt like a criminal			0

@entity9 found 319 suspicious sheds and garages *emitting* heat
at least 1,000 could be living in converted outbuildings without permission
plane criss - crossed streets , picking up heat signals from outbuildings
*analysis* of images from night *flight* revealed suspicious dwellings
they can be spotted because sheds are n't insulated so heat escapes
