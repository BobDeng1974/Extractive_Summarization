by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 14:25 est , 18 september 2013 novelist sir @entity1 has accused the government of ‘ pussy footing ’ around on dementia treatment and withholding vital research funds			1
in a damning blog , the top - selling author - who was diagnosed with @entity7 ’s in 2007 - said care services were left to ‘ paper over the cracks ’ of a lack of funds			1
sir @entity1 wrote a personal reflection on society ’s response to the disease alongside his own experiences in the inaugural article for the @entity21			1
sir @entity1 , 65 , has accused the government of ' pussy footing ' around on dementia treatment and withholding vital research funds			1
sir @entity1 was diagnosed with @entity7 's disease in 2007 he called for more investment into research and said science needed to deliver on its promises			1
the 65 - year - old said : ‘ technology and a trained and compassionate care system can help paper over the cracks , but , a decade since the last proclaimed development , science needs to deliver on its promises			1
' there ’s more money floating around the government for research , but barely enough to buy a middling @entity40 striker			1
‘ if we ’re serious about this thing , and want to match the fanfare with the funding , then more money needs to be found down the back of @entity48 ’s sofa			1
’ the author , famous for his @entity51 fantasy books , added : ‘ if there is indeed an emerging sense - finally - that we ’ve stopped pussy footing around dementia and can now bear to utter its name , we nevertheless find a cloud of unknowing persists			2
‘ people read , watch and hear more about it than ever before			2
they know it ’s out there			2
sir @entity1 said ' if we 're serious about this thing , and want to match the fanfare with the funding , then more money needs to be found down the back of @entity48 's sofa ' ‘ they know it will claim more of us as we continue to age			1
‘ dementia vies with cancer in an unsavoury battle of the scariest , but it must be said that some lucky people will survive cancer			2
‘ but i suspect many still do n’t understand dementia or , at least , understand it only as an insidious memory loss			0
the fear , perhaps , is a fear of the unknown			0
‘ there is n’t one kind of dementia			0
there are n’t a dozen kinds			0
there are hundreds of thousands			0
‘ each person who lives with one of these diseases will be affected in uniquely destructive ways			0
‘ i , for one , am the only person suffering from @entity1 ’s posterior cortical atrophy which , for some unknown reason , still leaves me able to write - with the help of my computer and friend - bestselling novels			0
’ sir @entity1 became a patron of @entity21 in 2008 , shortly after announcing his diagnosis with posterior cortical atrophy , a rare variant of alzheimer ’s disease primarily affecting vision			1
he went on to make a personal donation of $ 1 million to the charity , and has subsequently campaigned for greater research funding , including delivering a major petition to @entity107 and countless media appearances			2
the charity ’s blog , www.dementiablog.org , aims to share the ideas and experiences of people living with dementia			2
it also hopes to bring news on scientists working to improve diagnosis , prevention and treatment , and the fundraisers who support the @entity124 ’s leading dementia research charity			1
in a closing statement sir @entity1 , from @entity125 , @entity126 , said : ‘ the funding drum will continue to be beaten no doubt			0
sir @entity1 made a personal donation of $ 1 million to @entity21 , and has subsequently campaigned for greater research funding , including delivering a major petition to @entity107			1
image shows scans of a brain with @entity7 's ‘ in the meantime , donors to this charity and all of us as tax payers put faith in the scientists working their arcane magic with limited means			1
‘ we need to know that they are beating the odds , and this should be the place to come to find out			0
‘ believe me , i for one , will be looking over their shoulders and taking them to task			0
come on , get on with it ! ’ there are hundreds of thousands of people in the @entity124 living with dementia , and more than 40 per cent of the @entity124 population know someone close with the disease			0
@entity21 funds more than £ 20 million of dementia research across the @entity124 - including more than £ 1 million in the @entity162 - and is a leading commentator on new dementia research findings			1
to read the blog visit @entity165 a new brain scan which could be used to diagnose alzheimer 's disease has been hailed by experts			2
there are currently no fail - safe methods to test for the illness which affects around 500,000 people in @entity124			0
but researchers in @entity175 have developed a scan which could eventually help doctors accurately diagnose the disease			0
the technology allows them to detect a protein called tau which builds up in the brains of people with @entity7 's			1
dr @entity184 , director of research at @entity21 , said : ' this promising early study highlights a potential new method for detecting tau - a key player in both @entity7 's and frontotemporal dementia - in the living brain			1
' with new drugs in development designed to target tau , scans capable of visualising the protein inside the brain could be important for assessing whether treatments in clinical trials are hitting their target			0
' if this method is shown to be effective , such a scan could also be a useful aid for providing people with an accurate diagnosis , as well as for monitoring disease progression			0
' larger and more long - term studies are needed to confirm these findings and investigate how well these scans can track the build - up of tau over time			0
' he added : ' for results like these to be translated into a tool that would be suitable for widespread use , investment in research is crucial			2
' the different forms of dementia can be extremely difficult to diagnose accurately using currently available methods , and research to improve these methods is important if we are to help people access the right care and treatments			2
' share what you think the comments below have been moderated in advance			0
@entity227 , @entity228 @entity124 , 5 days ago sir @entity1 complains about lack of research but he ignores the research that has already been published			2
it is known that @entity7 's is mainly caused by toxic metals , autopsies prove this			1
it is also known that the brains of @entity7 's patients lack a fat called @entity241			1
if people with @entity7 's were to de-tox their brain of the toxic metals , and supplement their diet with @entity241 , their @entity7 's would go away			1
more details can be found in the book - " @entity249 : how @entity250 " , - by @entity251 and @entity252			0
@entity253 , @entity254 , 5 days ago do n't tell me you ca n't afford your own treatment terry , you have made millions from your writing career , do you live in a fantasy world ? @entity260 , cardigan , 5 days ago sir @entity1 is absolutely right , the government is great at bragging about what they 'll do , but useless as putting their money where their mouth is			1
at least he has donated a million - bet the @entity267 wo n't do the same ever			0
