@entity2 , general secretary of @entity3 , warned that industrial action over pay , pensions and cuts to public services is ' inevitable ' and will continue until the next polling day			1

meanwhile , members of the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) are striking today claiming job cuts are undermining efforts to clamp down on tax avoidance schemes			1
they will take action across the @entity10 , warning that the walkout will close offices and leave telephone calls unanswered			0
it comes as it emerged @entity15 does n't have the resources to deal with more than 20,0000 tax tribunal cases where billions of pounds of potential revenue is tied up			1
the backlog is so huge it will take 38 years to clear at the current rate , according to @entity45			2
in the past year there have been a series of national strikes held by public sector workers , while teachers are threatening co-ordinated action in the autumn and doctors took industrial action last week for the first time in almost 40 years , while police and prison officers have also staged demonstrations			2
' this campaign will run and run , probably up to the next election , ' said mr @entity2 ahead of @entity3 's national conference which opens in @entity62 on monday			1
' governments that do n't listen to the concerns of ordinary people tend to get turfed out of office			0
there will be further campaigns and further strikes and all this will be a major issue at the next election			0
' he told the @entity73 that further strikes were ' inevitable '			0
mr @entity2 said @entity4 has to ' get its act together ' and prepare for a general election in 2014 , a year earlier than the next poll is due			1
' the @entity4 would be sensible to prepare for an election			1
these are extraordinary times - none of us have been here before , no - one knows what is around the corner			0
' anything can happen , but i hope people do n't forget the ineptitude of this government and the blame they are trying to put on workers for the economic crisis			0
' strike : @entity93 , general secretary of the @entity31 union on the picket line at the @entity96 during the protest over pensions last year mr @entity2 who will make his keynote speech to delegates on monday , said workers desperately needed hope amid the government 's austerity measures and ' attacks ' on public services , adding it was ' frightening ' that most of the spending cuts have n't been implemented yet			1
he said the ' attack ' on millions of hardworking families is ' forfeiting the ( government 's right to rule '			0
he urged @entity4 leader @entity113 , who addresses the conference later this week , to give details of the party 's alternative to the government 's policies			1
@entity3 has been involved in a spate of industrial disputes this year involving fuel tanker drivers , public sector workers and @entity125 bus drivers , who went on strike on friday in a row over an @entity130 bonus payment			2

the pcs union say job cuts are undermining efforts to investigate tax avoidance schemes like the one used by comedian @entity137 the pcs union said 30,000 jobs have been axed since 2005 and a further 10,000 are set to go , ' undermining ' efforts to investigate schemes such as the one used by comedian @entity137 , which sparked a political row last week			1
the @entity31 said an estimated £ 120 billion was lost every year because of tax evasion and avoidance , claiming that @entity15 did not have enough resources to tackle the problem			1
the strike is also in opposition to ' creeping privatisation ' in the department , which is currently trialling the use of private firms to handle tax credit inquiries			0
the strike will be followed by other forms of action such as a ban on overtime			0
@entity31 general secretary @entity93 said : ' it is sickening to see millionaires in the cabinet wringing their hands about the immorality of tax avoidance when it is their lack of political will to act that means we lose tens of billions of pounds every year			1
' the case for investment in our public services as an alternative to austerity could not be more obvious than it is in @entity15			2
yet the government wants to cut 10,000 more jobs from the department , letting the wealthy tax dodgers off the hook and punishing the rest of us for a recession we did not cause			0
' an @entity15 spokesman said : ' @entity15 is disappointed with the decision to strike and will do everything it can to maintain services to the public			2
upset : protesters march with placards in @entity125 in november last year when more than two million public sector workers staged a nationwide strike ' we are seeking dialogue with the @entity31 to address their concerns and will work to minimise any disruption to our customers			2
' in our 2010 spending review the government made £ 917m available to us to tackle avoidance , evasion and fraud			0
' this is being used to increase our tax take from compliance work by £ 7bn a year in 2014/15 which we are on target to do			0
' last year alone we increased the yield from our compliance work to £ 13.9bn			0
