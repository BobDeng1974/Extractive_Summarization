by @entity0 this is the shocking moment a pair of drug addicts slumped on the floor of a public toilet after taking legal highs			1
the two addicts had injected themselves just yards from a popular park full of adults and children at lunchtime			1
the pair are thought to have bought the legal highs from a nearby shop before going into the toilet in broad daylight for a fix			1
when police arrived one of the men came around while it took around ten minutes to wake the other from his drug - fuelled daze			1
the incident took place around 2pm one monday next to @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 and just metres from the plush @entity39			1
@entity41 and @entity38 police condemned the druggies ' behaviour and said they feared it was only a matter of time before a child pricked themselves on one of their discarded needles			1
acting inspector @entity50 said : ' the public who pay their taxes should n't have this experience coming into @entity37			1
legal highs have seen an ' unprecedented expansion ' in @entity57 in recent years - with one in ten people in @entity57 now admitting they have tried the drugs			1
new types of the dangerous drugs are being detected at the rate of two a week , a report has found			0
and the unprecedented rise in the number of potentially toxic new chemicals has left police and drug agencies in the @entity57 struggling to keep up			2
the @entity71 's @entity70 report said 348 legal highs have been identified across the globe , with 97 new substances detected last year alone - up from 8 new ones a year earlier			1
legal highs are designed to imitate the effects of @entity79 drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy while having enough differences in their chemical make - up to get around existing bans			1
many new drugs are created in back - street laboratories in the @entity87 and are marketed as plant food or bath salts to try to skirt the law			2
police can not stop their sale in shops or at festivals because they are not prohibited			0
users of so - called designer drugs were warned that they are playing ' @entity97 ' with their lives after a huge surge in the number of deaths			2
doctors and nurses in @entity57 have been left ' powerless ' to treat casualties when they fall ill because they are unable to identify what substances they have taken so can not provide appropriate medical care			2
' it 's not right that people in that lovely area sit down to have their lunch and before they leave go into the toilets to see this			0
' our fear is that if people are injecting in public toilets in broad daylight , then children could go into the toilets , pick up a used needle and accidentally stab themselves			1
i can see it 's only a matter of time			0
' the number one shop for selling legal highs in @entity37 is @entity127 , which is part of a chain of three stores in the @entity130			1
on its website , the company describes itself as ' biggest and best selling @entity133 in the @entity134 '			0
there is no law against @entity127 selling legal highs - providing it is not suggested they are for human consumption			2
but the firm has been shrouded in controversy in recent years			0
@entity143 and @entity144 , the owners , were ordered to pay more than £ 210,000 in fines , costs and confiscation orders last year after admitting having banned substances at their shops			2
it is unknown whether the drug users photographed on the floor of the public toilets had bought their legal highs from @entity127			1
but one officer , from @entity157 , has said he believes most of the town 's 20 - 30 regular legal high users buy their product at the store			1
no one was from @entity127 was available to comment today			0
people ca n't be prosecuted for purchasing ' legal highs ' , which are often advertised as plant food and ' not for human consumption '			2
the latest official @entity57 figures show 68 deaths were linked to legal highs in 2012 , up from 10 in 2009 a recent report from the @entity71 showed there were now 348 types of legal highs - an increase of 100 in the last year			2
@entity41 and @entity38 police condemned the pair 's behaviour and said they feared it was only a matter of time before a child pricked themselves on one of their discarded needles @entity185 , a spokesperson for the @entity186 , yesterday blamed the government 's lack of action for the rise in the use of legal highs			1
he said : ' shops on high streets have been banned in @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 so why not in the @entity57 ? ' they might be billed as bath salts or plant food but we all know what they are sold for			0
' lots of the substances are n't suitable for consumption , but the shop owners do n't care , they are just in it to make money			0
' we have campaigned against new psychoactive substances ( legal highs ) but the government is just sitting on its hands			2
it is paralysis by analysis			0
' i question why these shops are allowed to be open on a @entity220 and why they ca n't just be banned			0
' police in @entity37 have been on a drug offensive after several problems in the area were linked to illegal drugs and legal highs			1
in order to combat the rising problem , @entity157 and @entity228 launched @entity231 and stepped up their efforts after multiple drug dealers were jailed and begging in the area was linked to drugs			0
earlier this month , a top detective in the area , detective inspector @entity235 , claimed that legal high shops were “ a disgrace ”			1
the number one shop for selling legal highs in @entity37 is @entity127 , which is part of a chain of three stores in the @entity130			1
on its website , the company describes itself as ' biggest and best selling @entity133 in the @entity134 ' the comments came after the legal high shop , hush , was linked to the death of a fully functioning man who took the legal high @entity248 and proceeded to repeatedly bang his head against a wall			1
this followed on from a rise in begging and anti-social behaviour throughout the area that were linked to the substances			0
police , using @entity259 , were urging people not to give money beggars , as rather than spending the money on food or shelter , they were purchasing legal highs			0
speaking at the time , @entity266 team 's sgt @entity50 said the operation is n't targeting the vulnerable			0
he added : ' our intelligence suggests a minority of people have become dependent on alcohol and the latest legal high drugs for a number of reasons			1
' in a minority of cases , they resort to begging to raise money to pay for these items			0
' while organisations such as @entity283 provide support and housing for those who find themselves homeless and suffering with related health issues , not all people necessarily wish to engage with them			0
' to disrupt and act in an anti-social manner in the town centre is n't acceptable and wo n't be tolerated			0
' several people have also been jailed over several months following drug offences			0
@entity292 was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of two counts of possession with intent to supply @entity79 drugs and two counts of possession with intent to supply class drugs in @entity37			1
the court also ordered him had to pay back £ 1,497.56			0
@entity302 also had similar success in the area , catching two people red handed of drug dealing			0
first was @entity307 , of @entity308 , @entity37 , who was caught dealing class a drugs such as @entity310 outside a drug rehabilitation centre			1
the 43 - year - old was jailed for five years on march 3rd after he admitted six counts of supplying class a drugs			0
@entity314 , 47 , of @entity315 , @entity37 , was also caught out by @entity231			2
