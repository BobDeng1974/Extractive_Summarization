mr @entity69 said : ' the best advice i can give is if you are going to use apps make sure you switch it off a good distance from your house			1
' personally , i would much rather lose a mile off my @entity2 record than have my house or garage burgled and my bikes stolen			2
' @entity2 , @entity4 and various other so - called ' cyclist apps ' work on a very similar basis			1
their point ? to allow riders to record their activity on a range of compatible gps devices , including @entity129 , @entity130 , some fitness watches and @entity132			2
the kind of data they can record include the distance and where the cyclist has been on a detailed map - pinpointing exactly where the rider has been from start to end			1
