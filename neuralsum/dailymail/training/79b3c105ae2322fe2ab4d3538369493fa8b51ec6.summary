a defiant @entity0 is refusing to curb @entity2 ’s attacking style despite rumblings of discontent over his management at @entity6			1
the @entity7 masterminded a fifth - placed finish in his first season on @entity10 , but he has seen @entity2 slump to 12th position this term after losing five of their last seven @entity16 games			1
@entity0 ’s side have leaked 31 league goals so far this campaign - only eight fewer than in the whole of last season			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 discuss @entity2 's style and @entity24 's injury @entity2 's @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 ( left - right ) appear dejected @entity2 boss @entity0 has seen his side make 10 errors leading to goals already this season @entity33 : midfielder has n’t made the same explosive start to this season as he did in 2013			1
granted , he has played six fewer games than at this time last season , but he has one goal from 13 shots , compared to three goals and 35 shots last year			1
@entity26 : right - back is suffering at both ends of the pitch this season			2
he has made 27 tackles ( 38 this time last term ) and 575 passes ( 729 in 2013 - 14 ) , but it is the five goals ( two this season ) and 15 shots ( seven this season ) that have been sorely missed			2
@entity56 : since his big - money move , the striker has yet to hit the heights of last season			0
at this stage last term he had nine goals and a 25 per cent chance conversion rate - this season it ’s six and 15.3 per cent			0
also , he has been flagged offside 20 times ( nine at this stage last season )			0
there are understood to be concerns around the club and even in the dressing - room that the manager ’s commitment to attacking football is leaving @entity2 exposed at the back , and there is little compromise to be found in @entity0 ’s single - minded approach			1
‘ you do n’t win games by changing the style , ’ said @entity0 ahead of thursday 's trip to @entity77			1
‘ changing only brings doubts			1
i ’ve been in this situation too many times			0
‘ maybe when i was a young manager starting out , you would start thinking about ( changing style ) after a run like this but it is very clear - in football you need to be outstanding at what you do			1
it ’s not good enough to be average			0
‘ are we going to concede goals ? of course we are			0
are we going to lose games ? of course we are			2
but it ’s important we know the way we want to play and that is never , ever going to be changed			0
our style is very clear			2
it was very successful last season , giving us the biggest points tally in the @entity16 in the history of our football club			1
@entity33 ( right ) has failed to hit the glittering heights of last season due to injury @entity26 ( right ) is not offering anywhere near as many goals as he did in the last campaign @entity56 signed for @entity2 permanently in the summer and has struggled to continue his form ‘ i ’m very much aware of the needs of the @entity109 game			1
i have been here long enough and i ’m not someone who works in percentages			0
i do n’t work on having a good defensive record to win things			2
‘ we work on other aspects and i like to have the talent that wins football games and try to build something that will allow the club to compete against sides that have spent a huge amount of money			2
‘ the players know what we are doing			0
we ’re stronger than ever			0
we know where we want to go and how we are going to get there			0
i will allow the results to speak for themselves			0
’ @entity128 's @entity127 ( left ) pounces on a mistake by @entity33 to score against @entity2 @entity0 is aware of the criticism after @entity2 conceded three goals at @entity132 and @entity128			1
but he is not about to let the pundits alter his way of thinking			0
‘ when you concede the kind of cheap goals we did against @entity132 and @entity128 then you are going to get those comments , ’ he added			0
‘ but the pundits are only assessing those two games , they have n’t got the deep information from watching that team over 18 months			2
that ’s part of the manager ’s job			0
‘ i ’m probably the most open manager in the league			0
i do n’t think anyone would have a conversation this open			0
i ’m always open to other opinions , but the reality is i know what out football style is			2
it ’s not about listening to opinions			0
’ @entity2 striker @entity56 ( fifth left ) scores at the wrong end against @entity132 as @entity24 dives there was more bad news for @entity2 on tuesday when it was confirmed that goalkeeper @entity24 will be out for up to six weeks with the calf injury he sustained against @entity162			1
the setback will almost certainly force @entity0 into the transfer market next month , with @entity7 @entity165 the only other senior keeper on the books			1
the @entity2 boss admitted centre backs @entity170 and @entity171 are unlikely to recover from ankle injuries in time to face @entity77 , while @entity174 ’s troublesome hamstring will continue to be monitored			1
@entity0 , a qualified physiotherapist , is known to be concerned that @entity2 players have suffered 18 hamstring or soft - tissue injuries in as many months , and it was confirmed on tuesday that the club ’s highly - respected head of medicine @entity181 has left @entity6			1
@entity24 has been ruled out for six weeks leaving @entity2 short on goalkeeping back - up @entity165 ( left ) is the only senior fit goalkeeper on the books at @entity6 right now			1

@entity2 have lost five our of their last seven @entity16 games
@entity0 refuses to change his attacking style , however
@entity2 boss *insists* they ' wo *n't* win games by changing the style '
