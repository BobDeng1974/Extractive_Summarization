her straw and mud hut looks more suited to @entity3			0
but unlike the wandering hobbit , @entity5 graduate @entity4 is staying firmly put			1
the 58 - year - old has spent the past 13 years living with no electricity in her self - built roundhouse , generating her own power and growing her own food			1
she gets her drinking water from a nearby stream and only rarely ventures to the shops for treats like rice and chocolate			1
her evenings are spent in the glow of her stove , cooking her dinner and playing music on her @entity15 harp			0
the vegetarian then retires to her wool - stuffed mattress and wool covers at about 7.30pm			0
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ this is how i want to live			1
this lifestyle makes me feel really happy and at peace and this is my ideal home			2
’ unassuming : the hobbit - like roundhouse has been named @entity53 which means ' spirit land ' in @entity19 living off the earth : @entity4 has banned modern technology from her mountain home the simple life : @entity4 keeps seven chickens , three goats and two horses at her eco-hut nestled in the mountains of @entity64 , she named her home @entity65 , which means ‘ spirit land ’ in @entity19			1
when her children , who are in their 20s and 30s and live in @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , visit , they , like all guests at the roundhouse , are banned from bringing technology such as phones or laptops with them			1
it is all a far cry from the conventional trappings of mrs @entity4 ’s background			1
her father was a violinist and her mother a librarian			0
after graduating from @entity5 with a degree in @entity85 , she married architectural historian @entity86			2
together they founded the @entity89 eco-community in the @entity90 near @entity91 , in @entity92 , round a 180 - acre farm in 1993			0
animal care : @entity4 milks one of her three goats as part of her daily routine one with nature : @entity4 gets her water from a nearby stream , chops her own firewood and only ventures to a shop to buy special treats such as chocolate for five years they enjoyed a simple life , then a survey plane chanced upon the ‘ lost tribe ’ and they were plunged into a decade - long battle with officialdom			1
officials were unable to find any records , let alone planning permission , for the mystery hillside village surrounded by trees and bushes and insisted the eight grass - covered buildings should be demolished			0
the eco-community endured a decade of inquiries , court cases and a planning hearing before their fight , backed by more modern support for green issues , finally ended in victory in 2008 when the roundhouses were given planning approval			0
but by then @entity131 and mrs @entity4 had divorced and the commune split into three entities , including hers			2
each community is independent and they co-exist as neighbours in a more traditional style			0
explaining why she set up her own home just before 2000 , mrs @entity4 said she felt a ‘ very strong pull to live life even more simply ’			1
teatime : @entity4 makes a brew on her open fire , adding milk from her own goat no stress : @entity4 relaxes in front of the fire in her hut before she heads to bed when it darkens outside at around 7.30 pm she is in the process of building a sixth roundhouse there and has permission from the council to build four more , as well as a sauna , workshop and community building			2
she runs a ‘ healing and retreat centre ’ on the site and usually has about five people living in the other roundhouses			1
they pay her a donation , which covers her £ 63 - a - month council tax payments , repair costs and supplies of grain			0
she said : ‘ i do n’t miss anything at all about what is normally called reality			2
the quality of life , in my view , is decreasing and everything is speeding up and becoming more stressful			0
‘ once or twice i have joked about getting a takeaway pizza delivered here when i am tired after a long day			2
but i do n’t think anyone would deliver a pizza across two fields anyway			0

@entity4 , 58 , has shunned *society* , living in a mudhut she built herself
the @entity5 graduate named her home @entity65 , which means ‘ spirit land ’ in @entity19 , where she has banned technology
she fetches water from a stream and keeps three goats , seven chickens and two horses
