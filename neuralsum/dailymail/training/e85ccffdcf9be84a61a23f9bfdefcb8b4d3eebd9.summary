mr @entity14 , from @entity60 in @entity61 worked with a design company in @entity63 to make his idea a reality			1
it is manufactured in @entity67 and the process took two years			2
‘ it 's similar to a mini-fridge but it will heat and cool , he said			2
‘ with modern technology there 's a little plate called a thermo - electric cooler - one side of it gets hot and the other gets cold			2
‘ what we have done is changed the polarity round so sometimes it heats and sometimes it cools			0
‘ generally you would keep the butter at about 18.5 ° c , or 19.5 ° c for unsalted butter			1

the dish ( pictured ) is designed to be constantly plugged in to the mains so that butter is kept at the perfect temperature all the time ‘ there 's a big trend back towards butter , i think something like 70 per cent of the @entity110 still use butter and that has grown four per cent over the last few years			1
’ mr @entity14 did lots of research and conducted focus groups to get the design right			0
‘ people do n't realise how much technology goes into it			0
the biggest thing was trying to get all the electronics into something small enough , because we did n't want something massive and unsightly , ’ he explained			0
‘ we wanted something small and pretty that could sit beside your kettle and toaster and look part of the kitchen			0

@entity134 , is the brainchild of friends @entity164 , 29 , @entity165 , 27 , and @entity166 , 48			0
mr @entity164 , from @entity167 , @entity168 , explained : ' this is a time saving gadget because you do n't have to wait for the butter to reach room temperate before you use it and stops you from tearing up the bread			0
