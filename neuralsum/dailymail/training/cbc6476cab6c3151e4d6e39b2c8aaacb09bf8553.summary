loving life : @entity0 is in high spirits ahead of @entity1 's friendly game against @entity6 giving directions : @entity0 talks to his players during a training session at @entity23 's @entity22 ' we worked yesterday in the pouring rain and i enjoyed myself - people say it 's a lot to do with the coach 's enthusiasm but it works both ways , ' @entity0 said			1
' the enthusiasm you get from the players keeps your battery going as a coach and i like working with them			1
' he added : ' the lads are full of enthusiasm , which is great , and it 's easy to coach when the players are like that			2

on the run : @entity61 striker @entity60 leads the way during a running session ready to go : @entity64 forward @entity65 ( right ) skips round coach @entity66 during training ' it 's not that complicated , football , ' he said			0
' you get the ball , you try to score			0
you have n't got the ball , you do n't let them score - it 's not that complicated			0
' people try to convince you it 's super-complicated and they can make miracles happen - it 's all about players			0
' @entity0 continued : ' we just have to keep trying to do the things we 've been doing			2
we want to try to be more positive , to get more people in the box			0
' that 's what we 've been working on over the last couple of days , we want to make sure the main striker is n't isolated			0

' it will take a wee while for them to get over that , ' @entity0 said			2
' but the best way to get over it is to play football			0
that @entity11 play - off final now is probably one of the most pressurised games in football			2
' it can be the best day of your life or the worst day of your life but we 've seen clubs in the @entity11 who have got close to promotion bounce back the year after			2
' we keep our fingers crossed that @entity104 will do the same because i thought they were a terrific side this year			0
