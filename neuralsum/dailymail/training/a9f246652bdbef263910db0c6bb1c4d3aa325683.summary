by @entity0 a former minister who once described the mp expenses scandal as ‘ a wonderful moment of @entity6 fiddling ’ was facing jail yesterday after pleading guilty to making bogus claims of £ 13,000			1
@entity9 is likely to spend @entity10 behind bars after admitting swindling taxpayers out of £ 12,900 in forged receipts for research and translation services			1
he used the money to fund jaunts to @entity18 , including a trip to judge a literary competition in @entity21			0
@entity9 ( pictured with @entity23 supermodel @entity22 when he was @entity24 's minister for @entity18 ) is facing a possible prison sentence after admitting he stole nearly £ 13,000 from the taxpayer the 65 - year - old pleaded guilty at the @entity28 yesterday , ending an extraordinary political saga which has raised questions about the protection offered to mps by parliamentary privilege rules			1
notably absent from court was twice - married @entity9 ’s girlfriend , @entity35 , ex-wife of former energy secretary @entity36			1
miss @entity35 , 60 , was released in may after serving two months of an eight - month sentence for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after she took the blame for speeding points that should have been picked up by mr @entity36 who was also jailed			0
absent from the court yesterday : @entity9 's girlfriend , @entity35 @entity9 ’s shock admission comes four years after @entity47 ’s sleaze watchdog launched an investigation into his expenses and a year after a police inquiry concluded there was no case to answer , before detectives changed their mind in the light of newly uncovered parliamentary evidence			1
the former @entity18 minister first came under scrutiny in 2009 as @entity59 was engulfed by the wider expenses scandal			0
@entity9 was initially dismissive of the furore , writing in @entity62 in may 2009 that : ‘ there will come a moment when moats and manure , bath plugs and tampons will be seen as a wonderful moment of @entity6 fiddling , but more on a @entity72 scale than the real corruption of politics			1
’ but two months later the commons standards commissioner , @entity76 , launched a formal investigation into his claims for laptops and translation services			1
in october 2010 mr @entity76 told @entity81 the invoices raised ‘ questions of possible criminality ’			0
however , officers were not given access to damning letters from @entity88 in which he admitted using a ‘ nom de plume ’ to forge invoices from a body he controlled , the @entity93			2
career : @entity9 served as @entity18 minister under @entity97 , here he is shown meeting @entity99 foreign minister @entity98 in 2004 the @entity24 mp said the @entity93 had been a ‘ convenient vehicle ’ to fund research trips to the continent and admitted in one letter drawing funds so he could serve on a book - judging panel in @entity21			1
the correspondence was withheld by the @entity110 authorities on the basis that it had been generated during parliamentary proceedings , and so was covered by the age - old principle of parliamentary privilege , intended to guarantee politicians freedom of speech			0
police dropped the inquiry in july 2012 on advice from prosecutors			0
then last november the @entity121 reopened its inquiry and recommended a 12 - month suspension from the @entity124 , castigating @entity125 for ‘ 19 false invoices over a period of four financial years which were plainly intended to deceive the parliamentary expenses authorities ’			1
the report also disclosed , for the first time , the incriminating correspondence between the commissioner and @entity9			1
he immediately resigned as mp for @entity135 and apologised but insisted he had never gained personally and that he had paid back the cash			1
police re-opened their probe in the light of the fresh evidence and @entity9 was charged in july , even though the letters were still covered by parliamentary privilege and would not be admissible in court			1
@entity9 continued to fight the charges , claiming he was given an assurance by police that he would not be prosecuted			2
but yesterday he finally pleaded guilty to a single count of false accounting between 2005 and 2008			1
trip : one letter , dated october 2009 , described how @entity9 drew funds from the @entity93 so he could serve on a book judging panel in @entity21 ( file picture ) warning him he may go to jail , mr @entity155 said : ‘ you will understand clearly i ’m sure that all sentencing options remain open to the court			2
’ following the hearing , @entity9 did not make any comment as he was released on bail , but he is understood to have accepted that he made a ‘ grotesque mistake ’			2
he is the sixth mp to face prosecution over the expenses scandal			0
@entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , and @entity169 were jailed in 2011 for fiddling their expenses			0
all four have now been released			0
@entity172 , who falsely claimed £ 53,000 , was given a two - year supervision and treatment order			0
@entity9 will be sentenced on december 19			2
former @entity24 minister @entity9 is the latest politician to face punishment as a result of the expenses scandal that erupted in 2009			2
in may 2011 @entity166 was the first ex-minister to be jailed when he was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment			0
the @entity180 mp for @entity181 pocketed £ 31,333 in claims for a ‘ phantom ’ mortgage and by grossly inflating the amount he was paying for another			2
punished : former @entity24 mps @entity166 , left , @entity168 were both given 16 month prison sentences other ex-labour mps @entity168 , @entity167 and @entity169 were all jailed for false claims			1
@entity167 , the former mp for @entity190 , claimed around £ 20,000 by submitting false invoices for services he never received , and was jailed for 18 months			1
@entity169 , @entity193 for @entity194 , wrongly claimed more than £ 14,000 and was sentenced to 12 months in jail			0
sentence : @entity169 wrongly claimed more than £ 14,000 , while @entity167 claimed £ 20,000 @entity168 , former mp for @entity197 , the only one of the four whose case went to trial , claimed £ 8,385 and was also sentenced to 16 months			2
in november last year former @entity24 mp @entity172 was found to have fiddled her parliamentary expenses and received more than £ 53,000 to which she was not entitled			0
she evaded a jail sentence because and has not received a criminal record because she was deemed unfit to stand trial because of depression and so the jury could not find her guilty of any crime			0
her false claims are so far the largest discovered in the expenses scandal			2
@entity212 @entity211 was jailed for nine months in 2011 after he was found guilty of illegally claiming £ 13,379 in parliamentary expenses , and the party 's first black peer , lord @entity216 was sentenced to 12 months in prison after he swindled £ 11,000 in false claims for travel and overnight subsistence			1
