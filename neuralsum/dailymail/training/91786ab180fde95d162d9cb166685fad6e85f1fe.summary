what 's black and white , slightly seedy and yours for about £ 1.50 ? meet the newest creation from @entity3 's in @entity4 , a pair of burgers that could almost be a pun on the ancient @entity8 symbol			1
while some have questioned the rationale behind the multi-coloured meat feast , it appears the answer may lie in a @entity4 saying			2
double the fun ? the burgers are certainly eye - catching , but some have claimed their appeal ends there ' @entity20 ' is an expression to describe someone who ' eats from both sides ' - meaning they have friends high - up in @entity27 ( the white side ) and in organised crime - referred to in @entity4 as ' black society '			1
according to local website @entity32 , ' the black burger has a black pepper sauce with bits of onions			0
the white burger was harder to place , but the sauce has a spicy kick with a sweet finish			0
' bun pun : the black and white burgers are apparently a reference to a @entity4 saying not all those who tried to burger combo thought it was a hit , and the website @entity50 posted a tongue - in - cheek review claiming it ' looks - and tastes - like hell			1
' ' i would sooner eat a century egg bathed in stinky tofu with a chicken - foot garnish than order this again , ' the mystery blogger declared			2
a deal for the burgers is available via @entity3 's website in @entity4 , the @entity60 reported			0
the set meal costs £ 2.60 ( @entity65 ) , but the set of burgers by themselves cost £ 1.55 ( @entity69 ) .			0
