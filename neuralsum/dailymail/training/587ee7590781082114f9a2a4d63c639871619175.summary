want to know just how terrible @entity1 ’s mobile phone network is ? take a trip to @entity3			1
last year on a research trip to @entity6 , i stood on a remote hillside hundreds of miles from any sizeable town and phoned home			1
incredible as it seemed , in the middle of nowhere , in one of the poorest countries in the world , my phone was showing five bars of signal			1
five bars ! up until that point , having used my phone only in @entity1 , i did n’t know that was possible			1
yet despite the strong signal , i did n’t manage to speak to my wife			1
she was camping with our daughter in the @entity27 and there was , of course , no signal			1
struggle : @entity32 as he revealed that he struggles to stay in touch with world leaders when holidaying in @entity35 due to porr phone signal the fact that i was forced to leave a voicemail thanks to @entity1 ’s often hopeless phone system spoke volumes			1
black spots , calls that cut out and half - snatched conversations are daily irritants for millions			0
the problem was highlighted this week by @entity32 as he revealed that he struggles to stay in touch with world leaders when holidaying in @entity35			1
the coverage is so bad that the most powerful man in @entity1 has to drive up the nearest hill to make a call			1
but it ’s not just @entity35 , rural @entity54 or the far - flung reaches of @entity56 where phone calls are impossible			1
much of our road network , railways and even parts of our large , crowded cities have no signal			2
so how did we get to the state where coverage is still so poor ? and can anything be done to force the phone industry to end the black spots ? problem : the coverage is so bad that the most powerful man in @entity1 , pictured with wife @entity72 in @entity73 , has to drive up the nearest hill to make a call the first @entity1 mobile phone call was officially made on @entity77 1985 by comedian @entity78 , and the first analogue service was updated to a digital network in the mid-nineties			1
that second - generation voice and text network began to be replaced in 2003 with a third generation — or @entity85 — network that could handle the internet , too			0
today , most phones use the 3g network			2
work on expanding the latest network — @entity91 , which promises broadband speed on your mobile — started in earnest last year			2
the speed of the mobile revolution was driven by the market — and the realisation that there were huge profits to be made			2
so operators creating the network of masts went for the easy targets of the densely populated cities first			2
smaller towns and transport links came next , and then finally villages and some of the more populated rural areas			2
with no financial incentive from customers or tough government regulation , there was little reason to extend the network to remote , sparsely populated parts of the @entity1			1
outreach : the government says it is investing £ 150 ¿ million in 500 new phone masts , such as this one in the @entity120 , in rural black spots where there is no coverage in 2000 , the sales of the newly available 3g licences to operators raised £ 24.5 billion			1
but those licences were given on condition that companies cover 80 per cent of the population with @entity85			1
that target rose to 90 per cent in 2010			1
the companies had until june last year to meet the higher target — and all did apart from @entity134 , which reached it in january			0
but while nine out of ten people sounds good on paper , the flaw with the @entity118 targets is that they cover population , not geography			1
out of the 63 million people in the @entity1 , 84 per cent live in @entity143 and a third live in the @entity145			1
thus mobile phone companies can meet their 90 per cent targets while leaving huge regions uncovered			1
talk to the four main mobile phone operators — @entity134 , @entity150 , @entity151 and 3 — and they ’ll tell you that coverage is widespread in the @entity1			1
about 99 per cent of the population has 2g coverage at home , while between 90 and 95 per cent have @entity85			1
but figures from the regulator @entity158 show that 23 per cent of the countryside ca n’t get @entity85 , while only 20 per cent is covered by all four 3g operators			1
about 13 per cent of @entity1 , including 4 per cent of roads , has no mobile signal at all			1
patchy : signal strength is worst in rural areas - in @entity35 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , west , central and north @entity54 , @entity169 and most of rural @entity170 ( pictured - signal strength is worst in rural areas — in @entity35 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , west , central and north @entity54 , @entity169 and most of rural @entity170			1
and those @entity158 figures describe only the strength of a mobile phone signal outdoors			1
once a signal has tried to barge its way through the bricks , concrete and steel of our homes , reception is even weaker			2
you might expect signals to be weak in remote mountain tops			2
but why are there signal failures in the heart of cities ? black spots are n’t just caused by a lack of masts			2
buildings or hills can block the signals from transmitters relatively close by			0
that ’s why it ’s possible for you to get a perfect signal out in the street but struggle at home unless you hang out of the bathroom window			2
equally , the sheer number of people in cities can cause a problem , even if you ’ve got three or four bars of signal			1
it happens during sports games , or after disasters			0
after the 7/7 bombings in @entity215 in 2005 , the network quickly became overloaded and went down for the millions desperately trying to ring loved ones			0
operators were forced to restrict calls to emergency services in the area around the bombings			0
mobile phone base stations are able only to cope with a set number of calls at a time			2
if you regularly find you get a signal but ca n’t get through , then your operator has failed to invest enough in new masts to keep up with demand			2
another major gripe for travellers is trying to use their phones on a train			0
there are technical reasons why it is harder for phones to connect while zooming through the countryside at 80mph , but mostly it ’s down to a lack of investment in trackside masts			0
a study published this year showed rail passengers are without a 3g signal 28 per cent of the time , while on motorways , passengers are without a signal for 24 per cent of the time			1
rated : @entity151 has the most reliable and best - quality coverage , according to the independent analysts @entity252 when it comes to coverage , @entity151 has the most reliable and best - quality coverage , while @entity134 ’s is the worst , according to the independent analysts @entity252			2
but your experience of your mobile phone company will vary hugely according to where you live , work and travel			1
the company 3 may do well in @entity252 ’ tests of 3g coverage			1
but if you live in a 3 black - spot in @entity267 , you may find it less impressive			2
the differences between providers are likely to get smaller over time with the advent of @entity91			0
@entity134 and @entity150 are working together on the creation of @entity273 , which should improve coverage			0
the signals should travel further and so could reach rural areas where you ca n’t get @entity85			0
@entity134 and @entity150 claim they will offer @entity91 to 98 per cent of the population by the end of 2014			0
@entity151 also says it can do that by the end of this year			0
the government says it is investing £ 150 million in 500 new phone masts in rural black spots where there is no coverage			0
the latest plan , announced last week , is to force companies to allow ‘ national roaming ’			0
so if coverage with one network drops , your phone will automatically seek out a rival			0
roaming is proven to work when abroad			0
but the operators say it will discourage investment in masts			0
why build a mast up @entity300 if your rivals will be able to use it ? there are technical problems , too , in ensuring calls do n’t cut off when your phone goes from one company to another			0
and working out billing and data limits could be a nightmare			0
if you have patchy coverage in your home , you can get two types of boosters			0
some plug into your internet router and act like a mini mast with a range of about 15 metres			0
others connect to the internet and smartphones using your home ’s @entity324 network			0
@entity326 , ceo of @entity252 , says some phones — such as @entity328 and @entity330 models — are better at picking up weak signals			0
‘ there are differences between handsets , even when the hardware looks the same , and it will affect your coverage , ’ he says			0
moving closer to a window also helps			0
phone signals struggle with brick walls , but do n’t object so much to glass			0
but ultimately , until the provision of a truly national mobile phone network is treated with the same seriousness as the @entity345 , your best bet may be to move to @entity3 .			0

@entity32 revealed he struggles to get mobile signal in @entity35
no financial incentive to extend coverage to remote areas of the @entity1
3g licences granted on condition that 90 ***%*** of population covered by 2010
but targets are not geographic , and a third of people live in the south east
about 13 ***%*** of @entity1 , including 4 ***%*** of roads , has no mobile signal at all
