@entity1 coaches have come under fire for keeping quarterback @entity3 in saturday 's game following a massive hit that left him barely able to stand			1
@entity3 suffered a series of blows during his team 's 30 - 14 loss to @entity10 but coach @entity11 failed to pull him - to the anger of @entity14 's game analysts , who branded the decision ' atrocious '			1
one tackle in the fourth quarter by @entity10 's @entity19 left @entity3 , 20 , limping on his left leg and turning to teammate @entity21 for support			1
then a monster helmet - to - helmet hit by @entity10 's @entity24 left him struggling to get up off the ground - and fans and commentators wondered if he had suffered a concussion			1
he remained in the game despite suffering a number of nasty hits still , he remained in the game			0
' that no. 7 is still in this game is appalling , ' @entity14 's @entity38 said			0
' it is appalling that he was left in on that play to throw the ball again as badly as he was hit by @entity24			2
' he can barely stand , they 've got to get him out ... that is terrible looking after a young player			2
' as the crowd booed , @entity3 threw an incompletion on the next play and @entity50 was eventually put in the game in his place			2
vicious : @entity3 ( 7 ) falls to the ground as he is tackled by @entity10 's @entity19 in the fourth quarter injured : he could be seen writhing around on the ground and reaching for his left ankle after the fall struck : next he was knocked to the ground by @entity10 's @entity24 and struggled to get up suffering : he stayed on the ground and grabbed his head after being knocked down - but his coaches said they did not know if he had suffered a concussion and that he could have come off if he wanted to but when @entity50 's helmet was knocked off during a play , @entity3 was entered again			1
' @entity3 can not be going back into this game , ' @entity63 said			2
' this young man looked groggy after that hit , he 's being put back on the field			2
he can barely stand up			0
' this is not good player management			0
we 've talked about player safety in this game , guys getting hit in the head			2
this is atrocious to me			0
' as the end of the game , @entity3 left on a cart			1
but @entity11 said he had n't known anything was wrong with his player and did n't see him get hit			1
' i do n't know if he had a concussion or not , ' he told the @entity84 after the game			0
dismissive : coach @entity11 , pictured right during the game , came under fire for failing to pull @entity3 from the game but he later insisted that the safety of his athletes was his top priority ' @entity3 's a pretty tough kid and @entity3 wanted to be the quarterback			1
believe me , if he did n't want to be , he would have come to the sideline , or stayed down			0
' he would not address the quarterback 's status following the game but after being lambasted for his decision to keep @entity3 on the field , he released a statement defending it			1
' the safety of our student - athletes is always our top priority , ' he said , @entity100 reported			0
' @entity3 was removed from yesterday 's game against @entity10 after further aggravating an injury to his leg that he sustained earlier in the contest			1
he was evaluated by our experienced athletic trainers and team physicians and we 're confident proper medical decisions were made			0
' the ( @entity112 ) has a distinguished group of @entity114 and team physicians who are responsible for determining whether or not a player is physically able to play			0
struggle : 20 - year - old @entity3 was eventually helped off the field by tackle @entity21 , right ' our coaches have no influence or authority to make determinations if or when an injured player returns to competition			1
the health and welfare of our student - athletes is and will continue to be a top priority			0
' the team was plagued with injuries throughout the game			0
cornerback @entity134 was injured in practice - his second injury of the season - and did not appear on the sideline , while lineback @entity137 missed the game due to an arm injury			0

coach @entity11 said he did n't see him get hurt and that @entity3 could have come off at anytime
but analysts called @entity160 ' atrocious ' for failing to look after his player
