by @entity0 last updated at 8:48 pm on 28th october 2011 it is becoming more and more apparent that @entity2 was destined to be a bad girl if you look at the example that has been set for her			1
with her father @entity7 having been arrested twice this week , giving him a grand total of six arrests under his belt , it is easy to see how @entity2 might have a very laissez - faire attitude towards the law			1
and now the 51 - year - old celebrity father has a fairly impressive collection of mug shots just like his 25 - year - old daughter			1
just like dad : @entity2 has racked up a collection of five mugshots over the past four years ( @entity21 ) october 2011 ( probation violation ) , september 2010 ( probation violation ) , july 2010 ( probation violation ) , july 2007 ( @entity25 and @entity26 ) and may 2006 ( @entity25 ) bad influence : @entity28 has a similar collection of booking photos ( @entity31 ) october 2011 ( @entity32 ) , july 2010 ( @entity33 ) , 2004 ( assault and @entity25 ) , 1997 ( probation violation ) and 1990 ( contempt of court ) @entity7 began his criminal history back in 1990 , when @entity2 was just four years @entity38 was investigated for insider trading and charged with contempt of court			1
sentenced to three years in jail , he was released in 1993 on five years probation			0
in 1997 , he violated his probation by travelling to see @entity2 out of state while she was filming in @entity45 , @entity46 and had been hospitalised for an asthma attack.the violation got him a further year in prison			1
in 2004 , he then got into a fist fight outside a party for his son 's birthday and was arrested on assault charges			2
while awaiting sentencing he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle after being involved in an accident			0
he then spent two and a half years in jail			0
in july 2010 , he was arrested in the @entity59 for domestic abuse after he allegedly pushed his on - off girlfriend @entity61 over a chair and then kicked her in the head			0
the pair were engaged to be married at the time and @entity61 later dropped the charges			0
serving the community : @entity2 , seen today having a cigarette outside her community service at the @entity70 however earlier this week , he was arrested again on similar charges after @entity61 called police in @entity74 , @entity75 claiming he had become violent towards her when she refused to perform oral sex on him			1
shortly after being released on bail , he was arrested again for violating the pre-trial terms set out by the judge stating that he was not to contact @entity61 , by repeatedly calling her - even when police were at her house taking a statement			0
he then tried to evade police by jumping off a third story balcony , breaking his foot in the process			2
he is currently in a @entity74 area hospital under police supervision , and will be formally arraigned this weekend on charges of violation of a pre-trial condition , two violations of a domestic violence injunction , and obstruction of an officer without violence			1
@entity2 , meanwhile , is due back in court on november 2 to find out whether she will be sentenced to jail for violating the terms of her own probation			2
the @entity103 star was arrested for the first time back in may 2006 for @entity25 after she ran her car up a curb and was found to be intoxicated			0
police also found a small amount of cocaine in her car - she was just 19 years old			0
then in july 2007 she was arrested for a second dui and booked for driving under the influence of alcohol , possession of cocaine and driving with a suspended license			0
in august she was sentenced to serve one day in jail , 10 days of community service and given three years of probation			1
@entity2 then failed to appear for a probation progress hearing in may 2010 and a warrant was issued for her arrest			1
her lawyers posted bail and she was ordered to wear an ankle monitoring device , undergo random drug tests and attend and alcohol education program			0
at a july 6 probation hearing the judge found her in violation of her probation after her @entity131 bracelet was triggered			0
she was sentenced to 90 days in jail but only served 14 days due to jail over crowding			0
in september of that year , her probation was revoked again after she failed a random drug test , resulting in a day in jail and then a three month stint at the @entity137			0
in february 2011 @entity2 was arrested and charged with the theft of a necklace stolen from a @entity141 store in january			2
it 's all going to be all right : when he was released yesterday , @entity7 pulled a thumbs - up sign and grinned for the cameras			2
he had been warned by the judge not to contact @entity61 trying to escape : @entity7 is said to have violated the terms of his release by contacting ex @entity61 , but tried to escape and hurt his foot by jumping three storeys out of his hotel she was sentenced to 120 days in prison , 360 hours of community service at the @entity154 , and 120 hours at the @entity156 morgue for misdemeanor theft and probation violation , to which she pled no contest			1
due to jail overcrowding , @entity2 served the sentence under house arrest , wearing a tracking ankle monitor , for 35 days between may 26 and june 29			1
on october 19 , judge @entity165 revoked @entity2 's probation , sent her to jail , and set bail at $ 100,000			2
@entity165 told @entity2 that if she wanted to avoid any further punishment , she must complete 16 hours of community service at the morgue before her next hearing , which is set for november 2 , 2011 .			1

@entity7 will add a sixth mug shot to his collection this weekend when he is formally booked
