it is the game which , ultimately , could define the success or otherwise of @entity2 and @entity3 ’s expensive @entity5 tenure			1
installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago , £ 1million - per - year @entity2 and his assistant keane – with a £ 600,000 salary - were given a remit of qualification for @entity12 , a task made easier by the expansion to a 24 - team format			1
defeat against @entity15 at the @entity16 on sunday , however , would all but render redundant any hope of automatic progression to next summer ’s finals in @entity20			1
it would be they and @entity23 left to do battle for the play - off berth			2
@entity26 jokes with @entity5 assistant @entity3 during a training session earlier this week @entity29 defender @entity28 catches a bib as the side prepare for the crucial qualifier against @entity15 the mood here in @entity35 is not one of optimism			1
an inquest , you feel , awaits @entity2 and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders			1
one newspaper described their manager as ‘ bookish and vaguely befuddled ’ , while the ‘ carnage ’ which follows @entity3 was also noted			2
certainly , there has been a definite effort to play down the chaos around @entity3 this week and the no 2 gave an untypically subdued and low - key performance in front of the press			2
@entity2 , meanwhile , has kept all talk to football			1
he has ignored the opinion pieces which have called into question his impact since his arrival			2
he has , though , recognised the magnitude of the outcome against the @entity61			0
‘ the importance of the occasion should not be missed , ’ he said			0
‘ defeat would be a big dent in our hopes of automatic qualification			2
it might not decide everything , but it is very significant			0
we have to try to win			0
@entity2 addresses his squad at the training session as they bid to go level with @entity15 in @entity73 the @entity5 players are out through their paces in preparation for the @entity12 clash ‘ i ’ve said all along that the home games will shape our destiny			1
this is the first of that group			2
we have to make them count			2
’ @entity2 , whose fourth - placed side trail @entity15 by three points , added : ‘ we can change all of that ( negative talk ) with one result and one fantastic performance			1
‘ we will not get very far with a pessimistic approach and i ’m not overly concerned with what people say before the game			0
‘ we have given ourselves a chance ( of qualification ) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match			1
’ one criticism of @entity2 is that he does not know his preferred xi or , indeed , formation			1
that much was obvious by him talking this week of players winning a starting place should they impress at their coastal training base in @entity105			0
@entity2 is hoping to banish all the negativity around the squad with a result against @entity15 one player not guaranteed to start is captain @entity110			1
he was dropped for the morale - shattering 1 - 0 defeat in @entity23 in november			0
the @entity114 striker , 34 , was sat next to @entity2 at saturday 's pre-match press conference and was diplomatic when pressed on his possible exclusion			1
‘ that ’s up to the manager ( if i play ) , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’ll be ready whether that ’s from the bench or starting			0
i ’m the captain , i have to set an example			0
‘ but i would n’t be here if i did n’t think i could make a difference			0
i still want to be the best			0
’ @entity3 , sensing the air of negativity in his homeland , added : ‘ it ’s up to us to make this a turning point for the team			0
@entity133 would give this squad and country a huge confidence boost			0
’ lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for @entity2 before they face @entity23 back in @entity35			1
win , and that £ 1m salary would look like a shrewd investment .			0
