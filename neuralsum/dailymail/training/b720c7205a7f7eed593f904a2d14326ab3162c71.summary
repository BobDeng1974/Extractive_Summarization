crocodiles and alligators might be more creative than first thought when it comes to catching their dinner			1
new research suggests the reptiles use tools , including collections of small sticks , to lure water birds to their death			2
while this is clever , mugger crocodiles in @entity13 and crocodiles and alligators in @entity15 and @entity16 , seem to be aware of the seasons as they employed their techniques at the time of year when birds build nests and collect twigs			1
a mugger crocodile balancing twigs on its nose to tempt birds collecting small branches to build nests with , at @entity29 , @entity30 in @entity13 crocodiles are not the only animals to display baiting behaviour			1
@entity35 herons use feathers and twigs to attract fish when the hunt and burrowing owls have been known to use faeces to attract dung beetles to eat			0
the @entity43 first noted that @entity35 herons bait fish using feathers , twigs or even berries			0
the study says : ' bait fishing was used most frequently by the individual which fished often in open water with fewer suitable rocks , where the heron has to overcome the handicap of being easily seen by fish			0
' only a few species of birds use the technique to try and catch their dinner			0
zoologists from the @entity62 monitored the behaviour of crocodiles and alligators , which balance twigs on their snouts to attract birds , which probably think the sticks are floating on the water			1
they saw this behaviour exhibited by replies living at rookeries in @entity16 and during the egret and heron nesting season , between the months of march and april , when the birds are trying to build their nests			2
the zoologists systematically followed the behaviour of crocodiles at four sites in @entity16 for one year to come up with their findings			1
the research is the first to detail tools used by any reptiles and the first known case of predators timing the use of lures to a seasonal behaviour of the prey			1
the scientists said it is common for some bird species to choose to nest in trees growing in ponds and surrounded by crocodiles and alligators , as they use the reptiles as protection against tree - climbing nest predators , including snakes , monkeys and racoons			1
however , the birds ‘ pay ’ for this protection as any chicks that fall into the water are usually snatched by the reptiles , as well as adults looking for nesting material who are seduced by the twigs balanced on stealthy crocodile noses			2
in the study , published in the journal of @entity112 and @entity113 , the scientists , led by zoologist @entity115 who has authored a book about crocodile behaviour called @entity118 , note the behaviour has been spotted in two crocodile species , which raises the possibility that the behaviour is widely exhibited within the group			0
they studied anecdotes and research about crocodiles at a rookery that was home to egrets near @entity132 , @entity13			2
here , an @entity134 alligator catches an egret after using its stick baiting technique			0
the scinetists saw this behaviour exhibited by replies living at rookeries in @entity16 , during the egret and heron nesting season , between the months of march and april , when the birds are trying to build their nest in 2007 , when researchers were observing the behaviour of large mugger crocodiles , they repeatedly saw them with small twigs balanced on their noses			1
on one occasion an egret moved to collect a stick and the crocodile lunged at it and later , similar activity was observed at large crocodile and alligator parks in @entity15			0
two of the authors of the study , who have worked at @entity161 in @entity15 for 13 years , which is home to 600 wading birds , said they had regularly observed alligators floating in the pond with sticks balanced across their snouts			1
they said the stick baiting behaviour was only observed during the bird ’s breeding and nest - building season from march to april , even though they were present at the rookeries until july			2
‘ using objects as hunting lures is very rare in nature , having been observed in just a handful of species , ’ according to the study			0
‘ at least one of them uses this method predominantly during the nest - building season of its prey			0
' this is the first known case of a predator not just using objects as lures , but also taking into account the seasonality of prey behaviour			1
‘ it provides a surprising insight into previously unrecognised complexity of archosaurian behaviour			0
’ crocodiles are not the only animals to display baiting behaviour , @entity195 reported			2
@entity35 herons use feathers and twigs to attract fish when the hunt and burrowing owls have been known to use faeces to attract dung beetles to eat .			0

zoologists from the @entity62 monitored the behaviour of crocodiles and alligators , which use twigs and sticks as bird lures
the animals balance a collection of twigs on their snouts during specific times of year in a bid to trick birds into *preparing* to nest with the wood
the research details the first known case of predators timing the use of lures to the seasonal behaviour of a prey
