@entity1 economy - class passengers of the future could enjoy almost as much luxury as those travelling in first class thanks to a revolutionary new kind of airline seat			1
@entity9 airline seats , brainchild of @entity12 - based engineering student @entity11 , are a low - cost , ergonomic approach to economy class cabin design			1
as anyone who has travelled in the cheap seats knows , today 's standard reclining models , which have not had a major design upgrade since the @entity20 , leave little space if the passenger in front decides to lean back			1
each seat in the @entity26 design has its own storage pod above the seat , which also contains the tray table and entertainment screen the aircraft seat of the future : the radical new design can give passengers more room - and stop the nightmare of reclining passengers i front causing problems to solve this problem , @entity9 seats sit in an independent space for each row - yet are so cleverly designed that they take up just 16 per cent more space			1
last year mr @entity11 , who studies at the @entity46 , won the @entity12 national @entity47 , an annual award run by the the @entity51 inventor 's foundation , for his groundbreaking design			1
he was inspired to come up with the elegant solution after a series of cramped and uncomfortable eight - hour flights back home to visit his family			2
' ergonomic features in economy class seats nowadays are limited to a mere reclining ability , ' said mr @entity11 , which , he explained , causes more problems than it solves			2
he told @entity65 of a typical flight experience in which the passenger in front reclines his seat , taking up ' one third of the space i have paid for			0
' what 's more , as well as the uncomfortable space invasion , such seating space interlopers also take screens and fold out tables out of suffering passengers ' control because of the way they are fixed to the seat in front , he says			0
' it gets worse when the person in front decides to recline his / her seat and the screen as well as the tray is then no more in your control , ' he said			2
to solve the problem , mr @entity11 designed @entity9 to not only give every passenger a minimum personal space , but also give them full control over their monitor and table without affecting others seated behind			0
each pod can be moved without affecting nearby passengers - and seats only take 17 % more space than existing economy seating the unique design includes both a tray table and drop down screen this he has done by separating the seat 's tray and screen from the seat in front , and instead having each floating from the hand luggage locker above the passenger			1
the back support of @entity9 is made of flexible , but strong nylon mesh which readily takes the shape of your body to avoid fatigue and whilst also preventing sweating			1
a set of 3 motors within the design of each chair allows passengers to customise the seating position to perfectly fit their posture - helping them to avoid neck and back pain			2
and instead of having a footrest on someone else â€™s seat , the footrest is now part of the passenger 's own seat and can be controlled to maximise comfort			0
the touch - screen through which the system is controlled is also meant for entertainment and is fixed independently from the seats , so passengers can easily move the arms to configure its position			1
the tray has a similar mechanism			0
of course , airlines are hardly likely to install new seats that take up more space just to make their passengers more comfortable , and mr @entity11 conceded that at first glance they would seem to come at significant cost			2
the cabin design claims to offer first class comfort , but in a much smaller footprint so airlines can use it as a new ' mid-class ' seat the back support of @entity9 is made of flexible , but strong nylon mesh which readily takes the shape of your body to avoid fatigue and whilst also preventing sweating seats taking up 16 per cent more floor space would leave airlines with 16 per cent fewer seats to fill			1
however , mr @entity11 said the bigger screens could allow the companies to make up for their lost revenue by selling a range of in - flight ' extras ' - in much the same way @entity178 makes money selling apps for their mobile devices			0
' the big screen for example can be used to encourage passengers to purchase a few dollar applications , movies , songs , games and books that could be used on their other devices elsewhere through cloud syncing , ' he told @entity65			2
' they [ the passengers ] can video chat with others and call home for small rates or they can choose to take part in surveys or watch advertisements to use these services free of charge			0
' they can connect to the local network and play matches against other passengers			0
' the possibilities are just countless			0
' mr @entity11 was the winner of the 2012 @entity12 national @entity47 award			1
the competition opens again this year on march 14			0
