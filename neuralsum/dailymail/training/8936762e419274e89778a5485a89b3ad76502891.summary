hate preacher @entity0 is expected to die behind bars after he was last night found guilty in the @entity2 of a string of terror offences			1
the hook - handed @entity6 cleric – who for years spouted evil on @entity9 ’s streets – was convicted by a @entity11 court of 11 charges after a five - week trial			1
the firebrand , 56 , had denied helping to organise a hostage - taking in @entity16 in 1998 when three @entity9 were killed			1
but a jury of eight men and four women took 11 hours to reach their guilty verdict			0
the trial took place just a few streets from the site of the attacks on the @entity35 on september 11 , 2001 , which @entity0 gloated was a ‘ towering day in history ’			2
@entity0 , also known as @entity38 headed the @entity39 in the 1990s , reportedly attended by 9/11 conspirator @entity40 and shoe bomber @entity41			2
the conviction marks the end of a relentless ten - year mission by the @entity2 authorities to extradite @entity0 , who only has one eye and stumps instead of hands			1
he cost @entity9 taxpayers millions of pounds resisting @entity2 justice and went all the way to the @entity52 but lost his case and was extradited to @entity11 in 2012			1
in court : @entity0 , pictured in a court sketch from last month , looked straight ahead as the @entity57 jury found him guilty of providing material support to @entity20 - linked organizations in @entity16 and @entity21 sending men to establish an @entity20 training camp in @entity25 , @entity2 one - eyed preacher : muslim cleric @entity38 addresses followers during prayer near the @entity39 mosque in 2004 finally : the hook - handed father - of - eight , formerly the imam of @entity39 in @entity67 , fought extradition to the @entity2 for eight years the jury at @entity57 ’s @entity70 agreed with the prosecution claims that @entity0 , 56 , was a ‘ trainer of terrorists ’ who recruited and indoctrinated young men at the @entity39 as part of his global empire			1
in his opening statement @entity77 , assistant district attorney for the @entity78 , also said that @entity0 used the cover of religion to ‘ hide in plain sight ’ under the noses of the @entity9 authorities for years			1
@entity0 was convicted of 11 counts of criminal conduct related to the taking of 16 hostages in @entity16 in 1998 that left three @entity9 and an @entity90 dead			1
he was also found guilty of advocating violent jihad in @entity21 in 2001 and conspiring to establish a jihad training camp in @entity93 , @entity25 , between june 2000 and december 2001			1
during the trial @entity0 ’s defence team tried to claim that the prosecution case , which included videos of his fiery sermons at the @entity39 , was just about ‘ words , not deeds ’			2
they portrayed him as an ‘ independent thinker ’ who was ‘ on his own island ’			0
they admitted the jury might not like some of things that @entity0 said but defence lawyer @entity110 told them : ‘ these are views , not acts			2
this is expression , not crimes			0
’ in his testimony @entity0 did little to enamour himself with the jury when he brazenly said that even today he loves @entity117 and that he thought 9/11 was a good thing			2
hiding in plain sight : @entity0 , sketched giving testimony earlier this month , was accused by the judge of hiding his terror message behind his religion @entity38 facing @entity2 terrorism charges , gives testimony in @entity57 federal court in @entity11 in this artist 's sketch ironically it was only due to his personal intervention that he spoke at all about such matters			1
@entity0 wrote a series of letters to district judge @entity134 saying his evidence would be ' important for historians ' and overruling his lawyers ’ objections to him talking about anything inflammatory not strictly to do with the case			2
a major defeat for @entity0 was the decision by @entity143 to ban him from discussing his supposed links with @entity145 or @entity146			2
mr @entity110 had had told the court that he had 50 pages of notes from meetings between @entity151 and @entity9 intelligence agencies between 1997 and 2000 which had been handed to him by the @entity9			1
mr @entity110 said this showed a ‘ constant dialogue ’ between them @entity0 - but the jury never got to hear it			2
as a result @entity0 was left claiming that he was just the ‘ mouthpiece ’ for the @entity16 kidnappers and nothing else , a role he likened to that of @entity164 with the @entity165			2
muslim cleric @entity38 in the street outside the closed @entity39 in @entity67 he claimed that he tried to ‘ de-escalate ’ the situation and told the jury he had nothing to do with the camp in @entity25 and did not send anyone to fight with @entity20 in @entity21			2
@entity0 - who had already claimed decades of disability benefit - cost @entity9 taxpayers millions of pounds fighting his extradition to the @entity2 but in 2012 the @entity52 ruled it could go ahead			1
during the trial there were moments of levity where @entity0 displayed an offbeat wit that was accentuated by his strong @entity181 accent			2
at one point @entity0 said that changing your name in @entity9 was so easy that ‘ if you want to be @entity185 , you become @entity185 ’			1
district judge @entity134 asked : ‘ and did you become @entity185 ’ @entity0 replied : ‘ no madam ’			0
among those the jury heard from were @entity189 , the former @entity20 operative turned @entity9 ‘ @entity191 ’ who told the court that he saw @entity194 , one of @entity0 ’s followers , at a terrorist training camp in @entity21			1
there was also moving testimony from @entity199 , one of the @entity16 hostages who flew to @entity9 and confronted @entity0 at the @entity39 mosque in 2000 - her interview proved to be a key piece of evidence			1
@entity38 was born in @entity205 , @entity181 in 1958 as @entity38 , the son of a naval officer and a primary school headmistress			0
after initially studying civil engineering he entered the @entity9 in 1979 on a student visa			0
he was granted @entity9 citizenship when he met and married his first wife , a @entity9 muslim convert , in @entity213 has previously said she was the one who got him interested in @entity214 and he converted after taking time off from his job as a nightclub bouncer in @entity67 ’s @entity217			0
@entity0 continued to preach near the @entity39 after the congregation was thrown out in 2003 as he found his new religion and his job incompatible , he instead resumed his civil engineering studies at @entity222 and @entity223 , gaining a degree			1
he then divorced his first wife , the mother of his oldest son , @entity226 , who at the age of 17 was convicted of being part of a bomb plot in @entity16 and imprisoned for three years in 1999			0
he met and married his second wife in 1984 in a @entity212 ceremony in @entity67 and had a further seven childen			0
heavily influenced by the @entity234 revolution , he took an interest in @entity214 and politics , in particularly the occupation of @entity21 by the @entity238			0
after meeting the founder of @entity240 in 1987 , he moved to @entity181 and then to @entity21 , and it was in the following years that he lost his hands and one eye			0
over the years , @entity0 has given several different reasons for the loss of his hands and eye			0
these include a road project in @entity248 , an explosion during a de-mining project in @entity251 , @entity21 , fighting the jihad as a @entity248 mujahideen , and working with @entity248 military in @entity255 when an explosives experiment went wrong			0
after spending time in @entity21 and @entity257 in the early 90s , he returned to @entity9 and adopted a new name - sheikh @entity38			0
it was in @entity67 that @entity0 began his rise to public notoriety as the @entity39 mosque imam , where he arrived in 1997			0

in 2000 , he set up a terrorist training camp in @entity93 , @entity25 , sending volunteers and money to @entity21 to support @entity20 and the @entity268			0
he firmly placed himself on the national radar in 2001 after speaking out in support of @entity117 following the september 11 attacks			0
his inflammatory speeches led to the @entity273 suspending him from his position at @entity39 the following year			0
in 2003 , legal moves begin to get @entity0 deported to @entity16 , a move which he appealed			0
