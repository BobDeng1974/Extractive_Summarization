for each increase in a person 's birth order , from eldest to youngest child , the suicide risk in adulthood went up 18 per cent , according to the study published in the @entity19			1
a study carried out at the @entity6 found younger siblings are more likely to commit suicide study leader @entity22 , of the university 's @entity23 , told live science : ' our findings are important , since they highlight that birth order should be considered an early - life circumstance that determines mental health across the life course			1
' the report said : ' recent studies have indicated that birth order is associated with suicide risk , with later - born children experiencing an increased risk of suicide			1
' it has been estimated that more than 20 per cent of suicides might be attributable to the combined effects of maternal age at child birth and birth order			1
' researchers say they still do not understand why younger siblings may be at a higher risk of committing suicide			2
it means there is little information researchers can pass on to family 's to help protect youngest siblings			2

' our findings are important , since they highlight that birth order should be considered an early - life circumstance that determines mental health across the life course ' - study leader @entity22 and the team found the link between birth order and suicide remained even when other factors , including the age difference between siblings , the number of siblings , their marital status and socioeconomic status was taken into account			1
@entity133 said the reasons are not clear , but suggested bullying by older siblings , and the fact parents rarely lavish as much attention on later - borns as they did their first child , could play a part			1
' lower levels of attachment to parents because of restrictions in quality time could give rise to emotional and behavioral problems , separation stress and psychiatric disorders , thereby contributing to a higher suicide risk among later - born siblings , ' @entity22 said			0
another possibility is that the risk is linked to a biological explanation			0
greater stress during later pregnancies could lead to the unborn child being exposed to higher levels of the hormone cortisol , which affects brain development			0
