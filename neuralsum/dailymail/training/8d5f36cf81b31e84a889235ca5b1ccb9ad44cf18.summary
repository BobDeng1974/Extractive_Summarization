the new @entity1 summer horror show @entity2 has come under vitriolic fire from none other than @entity2 itself			1
the @entity6 are taking aim at the show , which premieres tonight , for being portraying stereotypes and pretending to depict @entity2 when it was made in @entity10			1
‘ in reality , this faux - reality show was filmed on the other side of the world , in a @entity18 prairie province , ’ storms @entity12			1
‘ @entity29 viewers are conned into believing the action is in @entity2 , which is after all the name of the show			1
’ @entity2 , which is likened to @entity32 , shows sixteen contestants being dropped off in winter - time , somewhere in @entity2 , each trying to survive longer than the others without any equipment or food in the remote territory of @entity39			2
their host , @entity40 ( played by the real - life @entity40 , former host of @entity43 ’s 2012 reality competition , @entity44 ) informs them that they need to make their way to the remains of a primitive trading outpost that was found abandoned in 1908			2
when they reach the settlement they discover the fires are still burning and the food is still cooking on the stoves , but all the inhabitants have vanished			0
the mock reality series shows the participants , who are in fact actors , chasing the $ 500,000 prize for survival in the harsh conditions			2
the tv show @entity2 shows the contestants fight for survival in the @entity66 tundra tunguska event : @entity2 was struck by falling meteor pieces on july 30 , 1908			1
the energy of the explosion knocked over roughly 80 million trees the tv show pretends to be filmed on the site of the tunguska meteorite explosion nearly a century after the event in @entity2 , @entity6 @entity1 and the show 's @entity29 production companies are also being accused of ‘ censoring ’ @entity78 from seeing online trailers and a pilot episode which is supposedly full of thrills , spills and scare tactics			1
when they try to look at it , @entity6 viewers from the @entity85 to the @entity86 are shown a message reading : ‘ we 're sorry , but the clip you selected is n't available in your location ’ even though they trying to tune in from @entity2			0
the @entity12 accused the show of being ‘ in keeping with the @entity29 stereotype of @entity2 , mixed with a cocktail of @entity97 horrors and then frozen in a @entity99 time warp '			2
the pre-publicity for the show says the participants suddenly encounter a tiger , which brings more mockery from the news website			0
‘ it must have escaped from a @entity18 zoo because @entity39 would be some three time zones west from the habitat of the nearest @entity66 tiger			0
' the critique continues : ‘ @entity2 's image in the world which takes another hit , just at a time when it is rightly recovering a more positive image around the world , with inward investment and foreign tourism growing significantly			0
' these investors and tourists come in search of the real modern @entity2 , unlike the makers of this tv fake			0
' the @entity12 goes on to say : ‘ this clearly is of no interest to @entity1 and those who made this series in @entity10 , namely @entity127 in association with @entity129 and the appropriately named @entity130			0
