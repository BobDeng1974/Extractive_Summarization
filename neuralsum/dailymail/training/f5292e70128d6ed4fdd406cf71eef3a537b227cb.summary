@entity0 has launched an astonishing broadside against the party ’s green agenda , saying that it imposes too high a cost on industry			0
the business secretary said industries with high energy costs such as steel , are struggling against their international competitors because of soaring electricity costs			1
chancellor @entity13 has given £ 250million compensation to ‘ energy intensive ’ industries , but mr @entity0 admitted this ‘ does n’t go the whole hog ’			0
it is a surprise admission from a @entity19 , because the party is passionate about renewable energy which is funded by levies on households and businesses			1
his party colleague , energy secretary @entity25 , clashed with the @entity26 last year when they blocked his attempt to set an even more ambitious green energy target for 2030			1
but mr @entity0 told a conference fringe event last night : ‘ we do have an issue which should concern us as @entity19 because of our very strong environmental commitments			2
many of our manufacturing companies and exporters – particularly in areas like steel and cement and others which consume lots of electricity – are struggling against international competition because of the cost of energy			0
’ @entity13 has warned against imposing green taxes which leave @entity47 business disadvantaged he said his party had to recognise that forcing businesses abroad would simply ‘ export pollution ’ to other countries and not benefit the environment			1
mr @entity0 was talking about why , despite the economic recovery , @entity47 ’s exports have stalled			1
he said the main reason is that half of @entity47 exports go to the eurozone which is still emerging from the financial crisis			1
they have also been battered by the growing strength of the pound against the euro			0
but another reason is green energy			2
‘ they [ firms ] argue that because we are trying to be green we are imposing costs on them which their competitors do n’t have , ’ he said			0
‘ now of course a lot of that is unfair , and we have now introduced compensation schemes to offset some of those costs , but ... it does n’t go the whole hog by any means			0
' there ’s an issue here about the extent to which we are willing to tolerate the export of pollution because of our own system of taxing and charging industries which have a high energy content			0
’ @entity87 , director of the @entity88 , representing heavy industry which directly employs 200,000 people and contributes £ 15billion a year to the economy , said : ‘ the penny is dropping			0
’ he said : ‘ we have been used to hearing comments like that from minister in private , about their fears driving industry offshore			0
but it is really significant to hear those comments from a secretary of state at a party conference , particularly at the @entity19 conference because of their green agenda			1
‘ hopefully the penny is dropping both with those who have been enthusiastic about the green agenda that we have to temper our ambitions to keep manufacturing investment coming into the @entity47			1
the compensation available does not out us on a level with @entity115 competitors such as @entity116			0
mr @entity87 said @entity116 has some of the most ambitious green energy targets in the world – and much higher household bills than in @entity47 , but the government gives billions of pounds in support to heavy industry			1
he added : ‘ @entity47 business , however , is trying to compete internationally with one arm tied behind its back			2
’ @entity47 ’s revenue from green taxes was £ 43billion in 2013 – the second highest in @entity115 .			2

business secretary said levies on energy were *undermining* @entity47 exports
he said @entity19 had to recognise green tax meant pollution was ' exported '
remarks will be *seized* on by the @entity139 who have warned of green tax harm
