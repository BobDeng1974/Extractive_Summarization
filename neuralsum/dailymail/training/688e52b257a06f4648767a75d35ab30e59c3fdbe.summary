one of @entity1 's top health officials says there would probably already be a vaccine for @entity4 if it were not for budget cuts to scientific research , but his own agency has seen a 69 per cent annual budget increase since 2000			1
dr. @entity11 , director of the @entity12 , said a lack of money invested in research over the past decade has hampered the production of vaccinations for infectious diseases			1
and a new television ad claims that budget ' cuts ' enacted by @entity22 are responsible			2
but @entity11 himself presides over the decision - making on how much @entity12 funding is devoted to medical research , an insider told @entity28			1
and overall funding for the agency is up to $ 30.15 billion this year â€“ up from $ 17.84 billion in 2000			1
and the @entity31 , the sub-agency in charge of research to combat potential epidemics , has seen a whopping 220 per cent increase in the same period of time			1
' @entity12 has been working on @entity4 vaccines since 2001 , ' dr. @entity11 told @entity65			1
' it 's not like we suddenly woke up and thought , " oh my gosh , we should have something ready here "			0
' ' frankly , if we had not gone through our 10 - year slide in research support , we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would 've gone through clinical trials and would have been ready			1
' that ten - year slide , an agency insider told @entity28 , is not @entity80 ' fault			1
' say what you will about @entity80 , ' the 15 - year @entity12 veteran said on monday , but every government agency is always looking for more money and in the case of @entity12 , we usually get it			1
' ' i 've been around the block a few times , and i 'm surprised at how cynical this stuff has become now that we 're using @entity4 as an excuse to ramp up the budget next year			1
' a liberal advocacy group called @entity96 began running a 30 - second television ad on monday claiming that the @entity22 is responsible for cuts in @entity12 funding that led to a slow @entity4 response			1
' @entity101 , ' the ad blares , following a montage of @entity22 saying the word ' cut			1
' it 's unclear whether any of them were speaking about medical research funding when they made their comments			2
during the first two years of his presidency , president @entity111 had the benefit of a @entity80 with @entity114 in control of both houses			0
in the federal budget passed during the first of those two years , @entity12 funding increased 2.3 per cent			1
in the second , it was decreased by 1 per cent			2
the ebola virus epidemic has killed more than 4,000 people , mostly in the @entity124 countries of @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , according to @entity128 ( @entity128 ) figures published last week			2
clinical trials on potential @entity4 vaccines have been rushed into operation , including one drug trial for healthcare workers in @entity135			0
it could take months before its effectiveness is known			0
in the @entity1 , it takes an average of 12 years for a pharmaceutical company to clear all the regulatory hurdles associated with securing a new drug approval			0
@entity128 director - general @entity143 said 90 per cent of economic costs of any outbreak ' come from irrational and disorganized efforts of the public to avoid infection ' the @entity4 epidemic has killed more than 4,000 people , mostly in the @entity124 countries of @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , according to @entity128 figures speaking from @entity12 's headquarters in @entity153 , @entity154 , dr. @entity11 said some therapeutics to fight @entity4 ' were on a slower track than would 've been ideal , or that would have happened if we had been on a stable research support trajectory '			1
' we would have been a year or two ahead of where we are , which would have made all the difference , ' he said			2
dr. @entity11 ' words came as the @entity128 called the @entity4 outbreak ' the most severe , acute health emergency seen in modern times '			1
the organization also said that economic disruptions can be curbed if people are adequately informed to prevent irrational moves to dodge infection			0
@entity128 director - general @entity143 , citing @entity173 figures , said 90 per cent of economic costs of any outbreak ' come from irrational and disorganized efforts of the public to avoid infection '			1
staffers of the global health organization ' are very well aware that fear of infection has spread around the world much faster than the virus , ' @entity178 said in a statement read out to a regional health conference in the @entity188 capital , @entity189			2
' we are seeing , right now , how this virus can disrupt economies and societies around the world , ' she said			0
who describes the current @entity4 outbreak ' the most severe , acute health emergency seen in modern times ' but ms @entity143 added that adequately educating the public was a ' good defense strategy ' and would allow governments to prevent economic disruptions			1
she did not specify those steps but praised the @entity188 for holding an @entity204 last week which was joined by government health officials and private sector representatives , warning that the @entity208 country was vulnerable due to the large number of @entity188 working abroad			2
last week , @entity210 from @entity211 became the first @entity4 patient to die from the virus in the @entity1 while bracing for @entity4 , health officials should continue to focus on major health threats , including non-communicable diseases , she said			2
last month , @entity218 @entity217 ban ki - moon urged leaders in the most affected countries to establish special centers that aim to isolate infected people from non-infected relatives in an effort to stem the spread of @entity4			2
@entity217 has also appealed for international airlines and shipping companies not to suspend services to countries affected by @entity4			0
doing so , he said , hinders delivery of humanitarian and medical assistance			0
healthcare systems in @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , where the outbreak was first recorded in march , have been overwhelmed by the epidemic			2
the disease has also spread to @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 and the @entity1			0
last week , @entity239 from @entity211 , @entity240 , became the first @entity4 patient to die from the virus in the @entity1			0
dr. @entity11 , who spends his days almost exclusively on the disease , urged for calm when contemplating the possibility of an outbreak of the ebola virus			1
he said @entity4 is a highly deadly disease , but it is also only transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids or objects contaminated with the virus			0
' certainly there 's been a lot of fear [ in the ] response from people who are probably at essentially zero risk , that this might somehow take over our country , which is really not going to happen , ' he told the @entity65			0
dr. @entity11 said he the development of vaccines to fight @entity4 ' were on a slower track than would 've been ideal ' ' and despite all the assurances [ ... ] it still has n't quite sunk in			1
there 's still the cable news people who are whipping this up , and frankly sometimes using it for political purposes to sort of shoot at the government			0
' dr. @entity11 said he agreed with the comparison made by @entity273 , head of the @entity274 , of the current @entity4 crisis to the outbreak of @entity277			1
but the current crisis should be kept in perspective			0
' more people will die today of @entity277 than have died so far in the entire @entity4 epidemic , ' he said			0
' we 've somehow gotten used to that , and it does n't seem to be so threatening or frightening			0
certainly in the @entity1 , another 50,000 people will get infected with @entity286 this year , because that 's been sort of the steady number			0
' how many more people will get infected with @entity4 this year in the @entity1 ? ' he said			0
' i would guess you could count among the fingers of two hands , depending on what contacts of the guy in @entity211 actually turned out to get infected			0

@entity12 chief dr. @entity11 said stagnant spending has hampered vaccine production
his agency got $ 30.15 billion this year , up from $ 17.84 billion in 2000
@entity31 funding is up 220 per cent since 2000
