by @entity0 for @entity1 children belonging to our earlier ancestors did not develop as quickly as modern humans , researchers have found			0
researchers studied the @entity8 , a 3.3 million year old skull discovered 90 years ago in @entity10			1
they found the @entity8 , known as @entity11 , was not like an ordinary toddler of today - it did n't experience a spurt in brain growth in its first few months , as modern babies do , making it less human - like than previously thought			1
the first reconstruction of the @entity8 , a 3.3 million year old human ancestor , found it did n't experience a spurt in brain growth in its first few months , as modern babies do , making it less human - like than previously thought			1
found in @entity10 90 years ago , the roughly 3 million - year - old fossil is thought to have belonged to a 3 to 4 - year - old			1
the @entity8 has historical and scientific importance in the fossil record as the first and best example of early hominin brain evolution			0
when this 3 - year - old child 's skull was found in 1924 , it was among the first early human fossils to be found in @entity10 -- and the first early human fossil discovery to draw major attention to this region as a place of origin of the human family tree their findings disprove the idea that this early hominin shows infant brain development in the prefrontal region similar to that of modern humans			1
the @entity8 has historical and scientific importance in the fossil record as the first and best example of early hominin brain evolution , and theories have been put forward that it exhibits key cranial adaptations found in modern human infants and toddlers			2
by subjecting the skull of the first australopith discovered to ta ct scanner , researchers are now casting doubt on theories that @entity11 shows the same cranial adaptations found in modern human infants and toddlers			2
it is the first time that such a high - resolution scan has been taken of the fossil			0
this disproves current support for the idea that this early hominin shows infant brain development in the prefrontal region similar to that of modern humans			0
killed by an eagle ? the @entity8 's skull found in @entity10 , the roughly 3 million - year - old fossil is thought to have belonged to a 3 to 4 - year - old			1

the @entity8 ’s first molars had only just begun to erupt through the gum and become visible as teeth , indicating that the fossilized jaw belongs to a child			0
closer analysis of dental development , crown formation , and root length has estimated the child ’s age at death at 3.3 years			0
the @entity8 is thought have been attacked and killed by an eagle			2
scientists suspect an eagle killed the @entity8 because puncture marks were found at the bottom of the 3 - year - old ’s eye sockets to test the ancientness of this evolutionary adaptation , dr @entity103 at the @entity104 at the @entity105 , and colleagues performed a virtual dissection of the skull			1
' a recent study has described the roughly 3 million - year - old fossil , thought to have belonged to a 3 to 4 - year - old , as having a persistent metopic suture and open anterior fontanelle , two features that facilitate post-natal brain growth in human infants when their disappearance is delayed , ' said @entity103			2
dr. @entity118 in the @entity120 facility at @entity105 with the skull ' results of the new study show that there is still no evidence for this kind of skull adaptation that evolved before @entity128 , nor is there evidence for a link between such skull characteristics and the proposed accompanying early prefrontal lobe expansion , ' @entity103 said .			0

find makes it less human - like than previously thought
