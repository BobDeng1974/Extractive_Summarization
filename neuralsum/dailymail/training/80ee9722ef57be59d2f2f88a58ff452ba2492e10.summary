@entity8 backstop @entity7 secured his place in baseball lore when the cover came off an otherwise routine ground ball he hit during the sixth inning			1
@entity7 had a runner on second base when his blistering ground ball caught @entity6 third baseman @entity16 by surprise , and then everyone else in the stadium			1

‘ i have never seen that in my entire life , ’ said @entity8 radio announcer @entity41 – in his 41st baseball season as a player or broadcaster			1
' i feel like i hit it on the barrel , not on the end of the bat , ' @entity7 said after the game			1
' but when i looked down , i see that something was spinning			2
i never thought it was the ball uncovered			2
' i thought he threw it to second base			2

sure out , or not : what should have been a routine out became a baseball blooper for the ages as the ball 's cover flapped in the breeze while fluttering across the field @entity70 hit : backup catcher @entity7 , who hit the ball , was safe by quite a bit and was awarded a base hit ' just when you think you 've seen it all ' : @entity6 first baseman @entity76 shows the damaged ball to an umpire ‘ that ’s a new one for me , ’ @entity41 continued between chuckles			1
‘ [ @entity16 ] threw it anyway , and it rolled over there like a napkin			0
’ ‘ i ’ve heard of hitting the cover off the ball , i ’ve never seen it , ’ @entity39 continued , still in shock			0
‘ he literally hit the cover off the baseball , ’ a @entity6 announcer exclaimed			1
‘ just when you think you ’ve seen it all … you will not see that again			0

@entity76 then hands the ball to an amused umpire who gives it a quick inspection before tossing it away			0
@entity6 catcher @entity104 , in his ninth @entity103 season , did n’t know what to think when looking at the ball before handing it to bemused manager @entity108			0
shocked veteran : @entity6 catcher @entity104 has spent almost a decade in the @entity111 , he is clearly confused by the series of events announcers for both teams wondered aloud what the official scorer would rule the play – @entity7 was given a hit because he beat the throw to first base			1
what looks like an ordinary single in the box score is anything but			0
‘ you could watch a hundred thousand more games and never see that , ’ said the @entity6 announcer			0
