a breast cancer survivor who underwent a double mastectomy before giving birth to her first and only child has hit back at critics for shaming her for feeding him formula			1
journalist @entity7 , from @entity8 , was 32 when she was told she probably had breast cancer , and , since it ran in her family , she elected to do radiation and have a double mastectomy with reconstruction			1
due to the surgery , she was unable to to breastfeed when her baby @entity15 was born five years later - but that did n't stop mothers and nurses from pressuring her to do so			1
in one instance , while giving her then - three - month - old formula at a baby - and - me yoga class , one of the other mothers gave her the unsolicited advice : ' you know , breastfeeding is optimal			1
' and a @entity39 friend commented on one of her husband 's photos , which showed him giving @entity15 a bottle : ' so you 're not breastfeeding ? it 's better you know ? ' everywhere she went , women and mothers would shame her for not breastfeeding , propagating the commonly held belief that ' breast is best '			1
in reality , however , recent studies have shown that breast milk may be no better for a newborn than formula			2
but when @entity7 sent the study to her friends , hoping to open their eyes to alternative views , one friend even offered to give her some of her own breast milk that she had frozen			1
' the irony , of course , is that women who breastfed in the 1970s say they were judged for being crunchy @entity67 mothers by those who gave the bottle , ' writes @entity7			1
' now they are considered mainstream and judging formula feeders			2
ca n’t we all just get along ? ' @entity7 explains that the first instance of formula shame occurred in the hospital the day @entity15 was born			1
even after the new mom told the lactivists who came to her hospital room that she was going to use formula , they insisted : ' you really should breastfeed			1
' the angered mother recalls : ' so , holding my day - old newborn on what was one of the most blissful days of my life , i had to tell the aggressive band of well - intentioned strangers my whole cancer saga			2
' unsolicited advice : on one instance , a @entity39 friend commented on one of her husband 's photos , which showed him giving @entity15 a bottle : ' so you 're not breastfeeding ? it 's better you know ? ' one nurse persisted even after hearing @entity7 's story , telling her : ' it may come out anyway , or through your armpits			1
' but when she consulted her breast surgeon @entity107 , who works at @entity108 , she told her that the goal of a mastectomy is to remove as much breast tissue as possible			2
as such , ' there should be no milk production , ' explained the nurse			2
what 's more , pressuring a mother to breast feed when she can not or does n't want to - especially after a traumatic experience like cancer - can have negative effects			2
' i think that women who have made the difficult decision to have bilateral mastectomies have already grieved the loss of not being able to breast feed , ' she says			2
' no group should make a woman feel guilty about the decisions she made			0
or make her feel inadequate about not being able to lactate			0
' @entity131 : ' for me , formula has been so vilified that i felt as if i was constantly explaining my situation , ' @entity7 writes @entity7 is not alone in her frustration ; when she sent the study to her friends , some women responded that they , too , have been made to feel ashamed for not breastfeeding			1
' some women shared that they wished they could stop breast - feeding so they could leave the house for more than three hours at a time			0
or so the father or grandparent could give a bottle			0
or because it hurt , ' she writes			0
' or because they needed to work and could n't spend long breaks pumping			0
or because they adopted their child and could n’t			0
or because they just did n’t want to			0
' and reactions to her article have been mostly positive , with one fellow parent calling it a ' powerful ' story			0
another person commented : ' thank heaven people are finally coming to their senses about breastfeeding			0
women my age have put up with listening to this bunkum about the superiority of breast feeding for 40 years and it 's really getting old			1
' and a third commenter agreed : ' thank you for this article			0
i too am sick of the lactivists pushing their agenda down everyone 's throat			0
why the hell is it any of their business ? '			0

@entity7 had a double mastectomy at the age of 32 , which left her unable to breastfeed when baby @entity15 was born five years later
