but @entity2 leader @entity37 ordered him to issue an apology			0
in a carefully - worded statement mr @entity1 said : ‘ at a public speech in the @entity41 in early july , i used a term which i subsequently gather under certain circumstances could be interpreted as pejorative to individuals and possibly cause offence			1
’ he went on : ‘ although quite clearly no such personal usage was intended , i understand from @entity2 party chairman @entity47 and leader @entity37 that i must not use the terminology in the future , nor will i and sincerely regret any genuine offence which might have been caused or embarrassment to my colleagues			1
’ in the recording leaked to @entity55 mr @entity1 was heard saying : ‘ how we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month when we ’re in this sort of debt to bongo bongo land is completely beyond me			1
‘ to buy @entity19 sunglasses , apartments in @entity8 , @entity62 and all the rest of it that goes with most of the foreign aid			1
' we need a new squadron of @entity28			0
who ’s got the squadrons ? @entity24 , where we send the money			0

writing on @entity75 , mr @entity37 said : ' @entity76 % right over foreign aid budget but pleased he 's apologised over the wrong language he used			1
' during a series of interviews defending his remarks today , mr @entity1 said people in @entity83 would not think the term ' bongo bongo land ' was racist because there is no such country			1
asked why he used the term when the majority of people would think of it as racist , he told @entity90 : ' no , they would n't			1
they might in your @entity34 bubble , your little world of @entity34 , but out here in @entity96 and @entity83 , where we tell it like it is , they do n't feel it 's racist at all			1
@entity1 's use of the phrase ' bongo bongo ' is not the first time his outspoken style has landed him in trouble , nor is it the most controversial			1
a former economist , he was elected as an mep in 2004 and has been making headlines ever since with his views on women , climate change and @entity110			0

' if i 've offended anybody in bongo bongo land i shall write to the ambassador at the @entity157 and apologise to him personally			0
' the @entity2 leadership believes mr @entity1 was right to speak out about the amount of money @entity26 spends overseas – equivalent to 0.7 per cent of gdp – but feared the row risked tarnishing the party ’s image			1
@entity2 chairman @entity47 said : ' we are asking @entity1 not to use this phrase again as it might be considered disparaging by members from other countries			1
' however , foreign aid is an extremely important debate that needs wider discussion			1
' mr @entity1 's remarks emerged in the week his party is due to publish its list of approved candidates for next year ’s @entity177 elections – at which the party hopes to get the biggest share of the vote			1
two months ago @entity2 leader @entity37 ensured an @entity182 mep was expelled from @entity2 ’s @entity177 alliance for saying a black minister in @entity182 was part of a ‘ government of bongo bongo ’ who would want to impose ‘ tribal traditions ’ , and would be better suited as a housekeeper			0

he said : ' what i am suggesting is when a country has £ 1 trillion of debt and we 're cutting our hospitals , our police force and we are destroying our defence services , that the money should stay at home and people who want to give money to worthwhile charities			0
' what i would argue is that is for the individual citizens not for the likes of @entity202 to pick our pockets and send money to charities of his choice			1
' if i want to send money to charity , i will do it of my own accord , thank you			2
' if you 're fed up with £ 1 billion a month going abroad with no audit trail when we 're cutting our police and hospitals , vote for me			0
if you do n't believe that 's ( aid ) treason - treason , i use the word advisedly - that 's how i feel			2

@entity303 , from campaign group @entity302 , said : ' what i can tell you is that in the classrooms that i visit as an anti-racism education worker , these crude stereotypes that see @entity26 as a civilised place and overseas as tribal is an extremely homogenising sentiment and i think it 's incredibly damaging			0
