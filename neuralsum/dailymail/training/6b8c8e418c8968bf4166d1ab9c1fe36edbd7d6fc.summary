by @entity0 and @entity1 a @entity3 dad accused of shooting dead a drunk driver who fatally struck his two sons heads to court for the start of his trial today			1
@entity8 , 32 , denies killing new father @entity9 , 20 , in a fit of rage after he plowed down 12 - year - old @entity12 and 11 - year - old @entity13 on a rural road in @entity3 in 2012			1
as his case begins , the jury faces many complexities with the evidence : no weapon was recovered , no witnesses identified him as the shooter and no gun residue was found on his hands			1
but there are also the moral issues , including how many people in @entity8 ' community have said they might also have taken the law into their own hands if faced with a similar situation			1
tragic : @entity8 , pictured with his wife and their three children , heads to court this week accused of shooting dead the drunk driver who fatally struck his two sons in a car accident in 2012 @entity8 ' attorney said he is a good man , a grieving father and not a murderer - but his defense has n't failed to publicly suggest who else might be responsible for @entity9 's death			1
legal experts acknowledge prosecutors could face a greater challenge than simply proving who committed the shooting , similar to another @entity3 case from 2012 in which a grand jury declined to indict a father who killed a man who molested his child			1
' it 's not the right way to do it , but jurors a lot of times make judgments based on moral responsibility , not legal responsibility , ' said @entity61 , a @entity62 defense attorney not connected to the case			0
the trial will focus on prosecutors ' allegations that @entity8 shot @entity9 in the head in december 2012 near @entity68 , about 30 miles southeast of @entity62			1
minutes earlier , @entity9 's car struck @entity8 ' sons as they pushed the family 's broken - down truck down a dark , narrow road just 50 yards from their home			1
missed : @entity75 ( left ) had welcomed a baby girl with his girlfriend ( right ) two months before his death @entity12 , 12 , died at the scene while his 11 - year - old brother @entity13 died at a hospital			0
if convicted of murder , @entity8 faces up to life in prison			2
many in the community have rallied around the dad , including setting up a @entity89 page , ' @entity90 , ' which details fundraising events and where individuals have expressed their support			0
but @entity9 's family says their loved one 's fate should have been decided by the justice system and no one else			0
' @entity99 ( @entity8 ) did was n't right , ' said @entity100 , 22 , @entity9 's common - law wife and the mother of his daughter @entity102 , who was born just a few months before the crash			2
' for other people to say they would have done the same thing ... you do n't know what you would have done			0
' victims : @entity109 , 12 , ( left ) died at the scene and his brother @entity13 , 11 , ( right ) died later in hospital loss : after the boys were hit , witnesses saw a man shoot the driver but none could identify him as @entity8 @entity8 ' attorney , @entity118 , says claims that his client took the law into his own hands are untrue , noting that @entity8 did n't even own a gun			1
@entity125 district attorney @entity124 declined to comment			0
arrested : @entity8 was arrested for the killing and faces life in prison if convicted neighbors said they heard gunshots minutes after the crash , and authorities allege @entity8 went home , retrieved a gun and went back to the crash site , where he shot @entity9 in the head			1
toxicology tests later determined @entity9 had been driving while intoxicated			0
but @entity125 sheriff 's investigator @entity138 said that in the moments after the crash , there had been no way to know it was alcohol related			0
witnesses have identified @entity146 as the person who approached the vehicle before the shooting , @entity138 said			2
and other witnesses said there was a man opening fire but none could identify @entity8 as that person			2
investigators never found the weapon , and gunshot residue tests done on @entity8 came back negative			2
a search of @entity8 ' home found ammunition consistent with the bullet that killed @entity9 , but @entity138 said the missing weapon could still make ' a big difference in the case '			1
so could the perceived moral circumstances , which legal experts agree may influence jurors			0
in june 2012 , a grand jury in @entity170 decided not to charge a father who fatally beat up a man who was found molesting his five - year - old daughter behind a barn			0
crash : police cars gather at the site where @entity9 fatally hit the two boys in december 2012 collision : the boys had been helping push their father 's broken - down car when they were hit by the driver in that case , the father called 911 afterward and urged paramedics to rush to the scene , shouting , ' come on ! this guy is going to die on me ! ' from a strictly legal perspective , experts say the @entity8 case will be difficult to prosecute given the lack of hard evidence			1
' the prosecutor is starting from behind the eight ball , ' @entity62 criminal defense attorney @entity195 said			0
@entity118 would not speculate on who may have shot @entity9			0
' mr. @entity9 lost his life out there at the scene that night , somehow , ' he said			2
' that is not a good thing			0
but to suggest mr. @entity8 has anything to do with it is a far stretch of the imagination			2

@entity8 , 32 , is accused of shooting @entity9 , 20 , after he struck his two sons , aged 11 and 12 , on a rural @entity3 road in 2012
*members* of @entity8 ' community have said they would have done the same
there are also issues with evidence , including how no weapon was found , no witnesses identified him and he had no gun residue on his hands
but his defense team has failed to suggest who else could be responsible
his trial starts on monday and he could face life in prison if convicted
