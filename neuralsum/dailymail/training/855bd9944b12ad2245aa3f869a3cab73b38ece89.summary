crackdown : an 18 certificate will no longer be sufficient to protect some viewers from sexually deprived and barbaric films with some set to be banned or have scenes cut sexually violent horror films will finally face a crackdown by censors over fears they distort the way teenage boys view women			1
the ‘ long overdue ’ decision comes following research which found widespread public concern over the increasing number of sexually depraved and barbaric films being fed to @entity19 audiences			1
the @entity20 has announced it will tighten guidelines over such films which will see more banned , or scenes cut from the content to protect vulnerable viewers			1
@entity26 , director of campaign group @entity27 @entity19 , said : ‘ this decision has been long overdue			1
‘ films have become increasingly more violent and the regulations have allowed that to happen			2
‘ this is what the public wants			0
people are saying enough is enough			0
’ the decision follows anger last year over the release of @entity39 , a film which includes graphic torture , rape and mutilation			1
the @entity20 initially banned the film but then agreed to reverse the decision if significant cuts were made			1
campaign groups welcomed yesterday ’s move , branding such films as ‘ torture porn ’ which dehumanise victims of rape and violence			1
@entity52 , director of the @entity20 , said that there is no ' one size fits all rule ' when it comes to classifying films , but @entity58 , director of @entity59 says that anything that protects children and enables parents to manage what their children are viewing is a ' supportive move ' barbaric : the @entity20 has announced its decision to tighten guidelines following uproar last year over the release of the @entity39 , pictured , which was initially banned the report by the @entity20 found : ‘ [ @entity70 ] are concerned about young men with little experience , and more vulnerable viewers , accessing sadistic and sexually violent content , which could serve to normalise rape and other forms of violence and offer a distorted view of women			1
’ it found that cinema - goers supported @entity20 intervention – even with films rated 18 – to remove depictions of violence on the grounds that they may be harmful			1
brutal : the film antichrist by director and screenwriter @entity89 , pictured , was criticised for featuring scenes of genital mutilation viewers were particularly worried about films which make scenes of sexual or sadistic violence look appealing , which could reinforce the suggestion that victims enjoy rape			2
the research is all the more potent in the age of internet , where youngsters can access 18 - rated content online without having to prove their age			0
the @entity20 concluded its policy did not ‘ capture all the issues ’ and as a result has strengthened its guidelines for films by including a list of ‘ indicators ’ it has to assess the film against before suggesting cuts or classification			1
@entity52 , director of the @entity20 , said : ‘ there is no “ one size fits all ” rule for any theme under the @entity20 classification guidelines , as long as what is depicted is within the law and does not pose a harm risk			1
‘ once again the public have told us that context , tone and impact , and a work ’s overall message , can aggravate a theme , or make it acceptable , even in cases of sexual and sadistic violence			0
‘ the decision as to whether and how to intervene in scenes of sexual and sadistic violence is complex , but drawing out and applying these aggravating and mitigating factors is helpful in arriving at a decision which balances freedom of expression against public protection			2
’ in recent years there has been a trend for increasingly dark , violent and sexually violent films including @entity143 ’ antichrist , which had scenes of genital mutilation			2
there has also been @entity150 ’s @entity149 , which depicts brutal violence against women , and @entity153 , which showed rape , torture and crucifixion			0
mrs @entity157 added : ‘ we know that it is easy for youngsters to access this kind of material , either via dvd or streaming it online			0
they are vulnerable to this content			0
i have issues with films like @entity167			2
they are dehumanising the victims and treating them as lumps of meat			0
’ graphic : @entity153 features scenes of rape , torture and crucifixion while @entity149 shows violence against women @entity58 , director of parenting organisation @entity59 , added : ‘ anything that protects children and enables parents to manage what their children are seeing is a supportive move			0
‘ violent material can frighten people , it can make people curious and it can make them feel that something like that is acceptable for one person to do to another			0
‘ it ’s important to keep that regulation in there to protect impressionable minds			0
’ the @entity20 has banned only two films in the past three years – the @entity196 and @entity197 , because both featured ‘ sexual sadism ’ for its own sake			1
it said that giving either film a rating would involve a ‘ risk of harm ’ to viewers			0
the @entity20 rejects films only rarely , preferring to give advice about how appropriate cuts would achieve the preferred certificate			2
if a film is banned it means it can not be released in the @entity19 and showing or supplying it is illegal .			0

the @entity20 has announced it will tighten guidelines which will see more films banned
campaign groups said that the decision was ' long overdue '
the move follows outrage over the release of @entity39 last year which had initially been banned
