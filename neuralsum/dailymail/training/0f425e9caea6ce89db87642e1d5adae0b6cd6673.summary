by @entity0 my mum chased moths away from my bedroom when i screamed as a kid , gathering them up in her hand and throwing them out of the window , promising they turned into fairy dust			1
she sat up all night to finish knitting me a school jumper for the new term despite having a full - time job			2
when my baby son was rushed to hospital with suspected meningitis 26 years ago , @entity15 dashed there and gave me the hug i craved as my tears flowed			1
as her only daughter , we shared a special bond			1
and i always knew she loved me			2
so when @entity15 no longer recognised me and called me @entity27 , after her 2003 dementia diagnosis , it was the loneliest day of my life			2
happier days : @entity0 ( centre ) , with her mum @entity31 , dad ken and son @entity34 , then aged three nothing could have prepared me for that moment			1
my dad had just died from cancer , now my mum had @entity39 ’s and believed i was someone else			0
for the next eight years , i watched as the disease stripped her of every last semblance of humanity			1
because of that , i know if i had to choose , i would rather have cancer			0
that 's why i was so astonished when @entity47 wrote in the @entity48 last week that she would be happy to take a new blood test that can predict if you will get @entity39 's			1
why would you do that when you know there is no cure ? what benefit is there in foreseeing yourself , imprisoned in a mind that , slowly but surely , is closing down ? " yes , cancer is ugly			1
but it does n't have to end in death			1
caught early , there is hope of cure or remission			1
with @entity39 's there are no survivors , only victims			1
you ca n't fight it			1
it 's going to get you " by the time @entity39 had finished with @entity15 , she could not move , speak or see			1
her world had become a single bed in a small room			0
why would i want to know if this might become my future , too ? @entity81 may have died of cancer but he was still my dad right until the very end , telling me with his last gasp to ' shut up ' as i urged him to ' stay with me ' and ' hang in there ' - showing the flash of fighting spirit that made me so proud to be his daughter			1
yes , cancer is ugly			0
but it does n't have to end in death			1
caught early , there is hope of cure or remission			1
with @entity39 's there are no survivors , only victims			1
you ca n't fight it			1
it 's going to get you			1
when my dad @entity103 died of lung cancer in february 2003 - just 16 days after being diagnosed - it was only five months after my mum @entity106 had been told she had dementia			1
she 'd grown forgetful , had trouble counting out money to pay for groceries , despite having worked in a bakery all her life and being lightning quick at giving change			1
@entity15 had begun to switch off the freezer when she came over to help me around the house			0
i left a note reminding her not to , but every time i arrived home the plug was pulled out			0
in the end i taped the socket			1
what benefit is there in foreseeing yourself , imprisoned in a mind that , slowly but surely , is closing down ? asks @entity0 initially , i put this down to her age - she was then in her mid-seventies			1
one christmas day as we played cluedo she could n't remember any of the characters or pieces , but i fobbed it off			1
i just could not believe my darling mother - a bright , organised woman - could have dementia			1
@entity15 and @entity81 met at @entity141 's @entity140 in 1943 when she was 16 and he was 18 , readying himself for war			1
they married in 1947 - ' the same year as the @entity144 ' , @entity15 always reminded us - after his four years in the @entity145			1
they built a life together			0
my two older brothers were born in 1949 and 1951 , and i followed in 1961			0
when they left their council house in @entity141 after 40 years and moved a few miles away to the village of @entity153 to be nearer to me in 1993 , it was meant to be where they would spend a long and happy retirement			1
sadly , their dream was cut short			0
on a day trip to @entity160 , @entity15 , @entity81 , my teenage son @entity34 and i went for a cream tea			0
as i poured the tea , @entity15 asked for a knife and fork			0
' it 's a cream tea , @entity106 , ' @entity81 said			1
' you do n't need a fork			2
' but @entity15 was having none of it			0
shortly afterwards , in summer 2002 , we took @entity15 to the doctor			0
he asked her questions , such as her address , the name of the prime minister , and , as i was there , what date i was born			0
but she could n't remember , laughing to cover her embarrassment , offering @entity181 instead			2
i took her hand and said ' it 's ok , ' while @entity81 stared at the floor , stunned			2
in september , she was referred to a memory clinic , where a consultant confirmed , after many tests , our worst nightmare - mum had @entity39 's			2
it took a while for this to sink in			0
we tried not to think about what lay ahead , instead planning lots of trips out to distract us all			0
then , in early february 2003 , @entity81 was struck down			0
it seemed one minute he was putting up a shelf , the next he had collapsed and i was searching for his favourite cap to keep his head warm as we set off for hospital in the freezing depths of winter			0
loved parents : @entity0 's dad @entity103 died from cancer , while her mum @entity31 had alzheimer 's disease for the last years of her life the next few days were a roller - coaster of tests , diagnosis - then disbelief that he had lung cancer			1
my dad , an ex-council worker , did n't want to die , but after war service in @entity215 , always had a sense of living on borrowed time			2
his reaction was that while cancer would kill him , he 'd do it his way			2
he came home from hospital on a cold , frosty @entity223 , slipping his hand in mine as we walked down the garden path together one last time			0
the neighbours rallied around , bringing his favourite food - bangers and mash and home - made custard tart			0
he got to say his goodbyes			0
he told me i had been ' a wonderful daughter ' quite casually as we sat together doing the crossword			2
it meant the world to me			0
he treasured each night lying next to the woman he loved and had married almost 60 years before ; he reminded his grandson @entity34 that : ' it 's how you treat people , not what you earn , that really matters in the end			1
' " @entity246 's dominated our lives for years , taunting us daily with the reality of who she was becoming " @entity81 died at home on february 17 , the eve of his 77th birthday , in his beloved bungalow surrounded by those he cared about most			1
yes , he 'd been in pain but it was over very quickly and for that , i was grateful : @entity15 's @entity39 's dominated our lives for years , taunting us daily with the reality of who she was becoming			1
with @entity81 gone , i became @entity15 's carer			2
she had difficulty remembering he 'd died and would ask , ' where 's @entity103 ? ' over and over again			1
in the beginning i would tell her he was gone , and each time it was as if she was hearing it for the first time , searing pain etched her face as she sobbed or screamed			0
i resorted to saying he was in the greenhouse and would be back soon			0
when i moved house in 2004 , @entity15 became anxious at every visit and once ran straight into the road			0
i reluctantly locked the door when she came over			0
i bought her a pendant engraved with her name and my phone number , in case she wandered off			0
i felt great guilt - it was like tagging a dog			0
within a year , @entity15 lost track of whether it was day or night and had to have @entity286 carers			2
they called one day to say @entity15 had taken the azalea plant to bed , another time , she stuffed a bouquet of flowers down the toilet			0
test for @entity39 's : the red colours are a warning of @entity39 , while the green indicate a normal healthy brain after a few years she grew paranoid , terrified ' a tall man ' was trying to break into the bungalow			1
as her speech deteriorated , she would mumble or repeat a single syllable over and over again			2
people would turn away as if she did n't exist			2
yet she needed others more than ever			0
i ca n't imagine how afraid she must have felt			2
her face changed , a blankness overtook her eyes , as if she had been switched off from the inside			0
after three or four years , when she could no longer talk , i found new ways to communicate , playing @entity310 to conjure up the days with @entity81 and , when we could no longer go on trips , bought a box that played the sound of the sea			2
thankfully , her last few weeks were peaceful			0
classical music played , i slept by her bed in the bungalow and waited for her to pass away			0
i told her i loved her , and that she would be with @entity81 soon , dancing one more time			0
she died in november 2010 , aged 83 , eight years after she was diagnosed			2
but , unlike @entity81 , we never got to say goodbye			0
@entity39 's does n’t allow you that			2

@entity0 lost her beloved mother , @entity106 , to the disease that has no cure
she watched *helplessly* as she slowly deteriorated
by the end , she did n't recognise her own daughter
a new test can predict ten years in advance if you *'ll* get the disease
@entity0 says she 'd hate to know her future will *mirror* her mother 's
