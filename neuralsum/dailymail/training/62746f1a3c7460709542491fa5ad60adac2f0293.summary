many people need a gentle nudge to exercise , and what better motivation than saving money on your electricity bills			0
that 's the concept behind the wheel washing machine and treadmill , created by @entity10 designer @entity9			1
he envisages a large hamster - style wheel fitted with rubber that captures kinetic energy as a person runs on it , and uses this to power other home appliances			1
the wheel ( pictured ) was created by @entity10 designer @entity9 for the 2014 @entity21 competition			1
his concept collects kinetic energy generated by the treadmill , which is built into a large hamster - style wheel it uses this energy to power washers built into the wheel , to churn water and wash clothes as well as light up a display			1
realising at the last minute your favourite dress is dirty , or you do n’t have a clean shirt for an important meeting could soon be a thing of the past			0
the @entity40 is a washing machine and iron in one that refreshes clothes , removes odours and flattens out wrinkles at the press of a button			2
pods of liquid are sprayed directly onto the clothes , before a drier circulates air through the device , and a dirty item is ready to wear in just 10 minutes			0

‘ wheel is a crossover between gym bike and washing machine by using human kinetic power to save electricity and our nature , ' said @entity9			1
‘ the power generated from the spinning can be used to wash clothes and the unused power can be savedas electricity in the future			0
’ the concept also features washing balls inside the canisters , designed to shorten the washing time and save water in the process			0
the power generated can be used to wash clothes and the unused power can be saved to a battery			0
the concept also features washing balls inside the canisters , designed to shorten the washing time and save water , solar panels to generate extra energy , and a flexible display ( pictured ) the concept design has been likened to a hamster on a wheel ( stock image pictured ) ' the treadmill mechanism helps the user for better work out experience and healthier life , ’ continued @entity9			1
elsewhere , the wheel has a flexible display , which provides ‘ a visual experience ’ for the user - such as films or music videos			0
solar panels also help absorb ‘ solar energy from daylight ’ , and these panels can be a substitute energy source when the treadmill is n’t being used			0
@entity9 is a product design graduate from @entity106 and is now a freelance designer			2
the theme for this year 's @entity21 competition was @entity110 .			2

the wheel was created by @entity10 designer @entity9
his concept collects kinetic energy generated by the treadmill
the treadmill is built into a large hamster - style wheel
it then uses this energy to power a washing machine built into wheel
