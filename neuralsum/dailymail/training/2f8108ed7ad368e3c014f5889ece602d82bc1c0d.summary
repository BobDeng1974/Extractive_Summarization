disgraced @entity0 received a hero ’s welcome when he appeared on the balcony of his home after being kicked out of the @entity5			1
the shamed striker was sent back to @entity7 after being hit with a nine - game international ban and four - month suspension from all football for biting @entity13 defender @entity12 last tuesday			1
but standing on the deck of his home in @entity17 , near @entity18 , the 27 - year - old looked unperturbed by the ordeal			1
some might say he even looked happy to be home , giving a thumbs - up to admirers who had gathered			0
thumbs up : @entity0 gestures to fans from the balcony of his home , near @entity18 wearing a hooded grey top , smiling @entity0 was accompanied by his children @entity27 and @entity28			1
his return came as his team - mates trained in @entity31 ahead of their clash with @entity33 and news that @entity35 are set to sell him to @entity37 for £ 80million			1
earlier in the day fans flocked to @entity39 to greet the arrival of the banned striker			1
@entity43 president @entity42 was even there at one point but left when he heard @entity0 ’s flight from @entity47 had been delayed			1
because of the delay , the crowd of about 1,000 fans were moved from the airport terminal to an adjacent air force base to await his arrival			2
angry : @entity7 national coach @entity54 claims the forward has been made a worldwide scapegoat by @entity57 the @entity58 are preparing an appeal against the severity of the sentence , which also includes a £ 64,000 fine and national coach @entity54 claimed the forward had been made a worldwide scapegoat by @entity57			1
during an extraordinary press conference at the @entity66 on friday evening , @entity54 read a pre-prepared 13 - minute statement to claim that pressure from the @entity70 media forced @entity57 to ban him for four months			2
the @entity7 coach then immediately quit his position on @entity57 ’s technical committee and told @entity0 that he has the full support of his country ’s people			1
rapturous reception : @entity0 was joined by his children as he greeted the army of fans who had gathered @entity54 said : ‘ many times you forget the scapegoat is a person who has rights and that in this specific case , besides the mistakes and faults he has committed , he has made significant contributions on the pitch			1
it is the contribution made by great football players is essential			0
‘ as a coach and a professor , and as a former teacher , i am presented with the theory of the scapegoat			0
you know what i am talking about , of giving a punishment , to someone who commits a transgression , not a crime			0
‘ we know the protagonists and not only because of the profile he has because of the mistakes , but there is another side to him			0
that is a message : the severity was excessive			0
‘ perhaps i do have the answers but like many people , those who not only have to make disciplinary decisions - who wins ? who loses ? who benefits ? who is harmed ? who got things their way ? ‘ to one of these questions , i will not give you a final answer , but i will try to find a response			0
on the basis of these exaggerated decisions , only with decisions of this nature i doubt it			0
after the @entity0 and @entity12 episode we have seen other things measured with a different measure			2
‘ when that happens we have the omission because not all cases have to do with the transgression with indiscipline			0
unavoidably this leads to exaggeration in terns if punishment			0
acknowledging his fans : @entity0 cradled his daughter as he waved to fans from his balcony ‘ we should punish and sanction , but one must always give the opportunity to hear from the person			2
’ @entity54 was highly critical of the @entity57 ’s disciplinary panel after they failed to give @entity0 the chance to speak for himself after the incident with @entity12			2
@entity57 ’s strict regulations rule @entity0 from any involvement in football mean he can not even watch @entity35 or @entity7 in action — he is banned from football stadiums and must train alone away from @entity35 ’s @entity160 training ground			1
@entity0 can be sold during his spell in football exile — a strong possibility — but can not personally join in negotiations			2
@entity37 have made it clear that @entity0 ’s ban does not impact on their intention to sign him and @entity35 have already started to get replacements			1
@entity35 are taking specialist legal advice , while the striker ’s lawyer @entity170 was in @entity37 to discuss his client ’s future @entity174 will become a @entity35 player in the next 48 hours after @entity176 relented and accepted a £ 25million offer for the @entity178 forward , four weeks after receiving the call from @entity181 officials			1
showing their support : fans carrying banners waited outside @entity0 's home after he returned home from the @entity5 backing their man : @entity0 has been hit with a nine - game international ban and four - month suspension @entity35 have also launched a bid to sign @entity193 from @entity194			1
following this third , high - profile biting incident , it is no surprise that @entity0 ’s major sponsor @entity199 are thinking of ditching him			2
he has already been punished for racially abusing @entity200 and biting @entity201			0
a statement said : ‘ @entity199 does not condone @entity0 ’s recent behaviour and we will again be reminding him of the high standards we expect from our players			0
we have no plan to use @entity0 for any additional marketing activities during the @entity5			2
we will discuss all aspects of our future partnership directly with @entity0 and his team after the tournament			0
’ another of @entity0 ’s backers , 888poker , are likely to drop him , with a spokesman saying : ‘ 888poker is seriously reviewing its relationship with the player as we will not tolerate unsporting behaviour			0
’ the independent @entity57 disciplinary committee , chaired by @entity223 of @entity224 , reached the decision to hand @entity0 a @entity5 record ban after 10 hours of talks spread over wednesday night and thursday morning before it was announced at @entity57 ’s daily briefing at the @entity66			2
the player and the @entity7 @entity230 had been informed minutes beforehand			0
the suspension starts with immediate effect			0
causing @entity178 havoc : @entity0 scored the winner in @entity7 's 2 - 1 win over @entity237 's side the committee took into account that it was not the first time @entity0 had bitten an opponent			1
his first victim was @entity244 ’s @entity243 in 2010 , for which he received a seven - match ban , and then @entity246 ’s @entity201 in 2013 , which brought a 10 - game ban			1
@entity223 said : ‘ such behaviour can not be tolerated and in particular not at a @entity5 when the eyes of millions are on the stars on the field			0
the disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and the degree of mr @entity0 ’s guilt in accordance with the relevant provisions of the code			0
’ the @entity43 media claimed that @entity223 ’s committee had come under pressure from @entity267 chiefs , including the @entity70 - hating @entity269 football president @entity268 , not to punish @entity0 too severely			1
will @entity0 wear a @entity35 shirt again ? : despite the controversy @entity37 are still keen to sign the striker but @entity57 insisted that there was no interference at all in the process			1
the world body ’s president @entity276 had been in @entity278 watching @entity224 beat @entity279 and flew back to @entity31 while the @entity0 hearing was going on			2
meanwhile , the @entity281 , who made @entity0 their player of the year last season , decided not to strip the @entity35 star of his title			1
@entity7 face @entity33 in the last 16 on saturday @entity288 defender @entity287 said the team were ‘ more united than ever ’ , while the country ’s sports minister @entity290 commented : ‘ we are hurt by this excessive sanction			0
now let ’s see how we can help this human being and whether the group can show its class and its love for @entity7			0

@entity7 striker shows no sign of strain as he waves at fans
27 - year - old is seen smiling while cradling his son @entity27
@entity43 president @entity42 had been at the airport to greet him
@entity0 hit with a nine - game international ban and four - month suspension from all football
@entity35 plan to sell him to @entity37 for £ 80m
