by @entity10 reporter published : 10:59 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 12:06 est , 11 september 2012 few people will be able to accuse @entity0 and @entity1 of not having any onstage chemistry			1
the actors , who met 20 years ago and went on to marry and have a child , are appearing together as a couple for the first time in a serious case of art imitating life			1
' the play is about a marriage that is at least 20 years old			1
it 's about a marriage that has children , ' ms @entity22 , 50 , said of their respective parts , and instant intimacy			1
' if we come in with people we did n't know , there 's a period of time before you even start to build with that			2
with us , a lot of steps got cut out of the process			0
' chemistry : @entity0 and @entity1 , who met 20 years ago and went on to marry and have a child , are appearing together as a couple for the first time in a serious case of art imitating life @entity47 theatergoers be able to see the husband - and - wife team up close as they star in @entity49 's @entity3 , a new version of @entity7 's play opening september 27 on @entity4			1
mr @entity0 plays a public - minded doctor in a small town who discovers the water supply for the public spa is contaminated and may have made tourists - the community 's economic lifeblood - ill. but his efforts to clean up the mess pit his ethics against political cowards and the media			1
his family suffers - including his wife , played by ms @entity1			2
ms @entity1 said during a joint interview : ' you always want to work with people that are better than you			2
not only do i get to work with someone who is better - who 's really , really great to be onstage with - but i also feel safe			2
i do n't feel intimidated by it because it 's my husband			0
' however her four - time @entity76 - winning husband , 59 , takes issue with that			0
he said : ' i 'm certainly not better than she is			0
@entity81 knows that is not true			0
i 'm always dumbstruck by how creative @entity83 is and how much she brings to the table			0
' ' i do n't feel intimidated by it because it 's my husband ' fitting for a pair of actors , @entity0 and @entity1 first became smitten while onstage			1
they had been paired as the lovers @entity91 and @entity92 of @entity93 in the 1992 @entity95 production of @entity96 in @entity97			0
they had briefly met before while shooting the 1991 miniseries @entity99 , but it was really when @entity102 director @entity101 set up private meetings with his cast that they first connected			0
mr @entity0 went first to meet mr @entity101 and when he came out , ms @entity1 was waiting her turn			1
the director reintroduced them and asked the pair , ' so , do you think you can fall in love ? ' opening soon : the husband - and - wife team star in @entity49 's @entity3 , a new version of @entity7 's play opening september 27 on @entity4 ' we both shrugged our shoulders and went , " well , sure			1
we were going to act that , " ' mr @entity0 recalled			2
ms @entity1 , too , was game : ' i said , " sure , i 'll fall in love with him			2
" ' and after the show ended , they began dating			0
over the years , they have shared a stage only rarely			0
there was a two - night benefit on @entity4 in 2002 and a play at the @entity128 a year later			1
they also were in @entity131 's @entity130 in 2010 at the @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 but that 's about it , until now			0
why so few times sharing a stage ? ' first of all , @entity0 can do musicals and i ca n't , ' said ms @entity1			1
' well , they let me do them occasionally			0
i do n't know if i can do them , ' says her husband , modestly			0
' certainly not well .			0
