‘ @entity6 was passionately against the use of drugs and would never , ever , have taken anything that would have caused her harm or even worse risked her life			2
she innocently took a supplement which at the time was entirely legal , and widely available on the high street , and somewhat worryingly , apparently used by so many others			0
final preparations : @entity6 , pictured in her running gear the night before the @entity3 , right ‘ it ’s clear that there needs to be far better supervision of the so - called health foods and supplements industry so that no more tragedies like this happen again			2
’ he added that the almost £ 1.2million raised in @entity45 ’s name for the @entity107 had given her family and friends much comfort			0

she ran in memory of her brother @entity117 who died aged 25 from a drugs overdose in 2001			0
dr @entity54 added : ‘ i hope that the coverage of this case and events leading up to @entity6 ’s death will help publicise the potential harmful effects of @entity21 during extreme physical exertion			1
’ high spirits : @entity6 , pictured ( left ) the day before she ran the @entity3 last year , and smiling for a family photo , right @entity6 wanted to raise £ 500 for the @entity107 by running the @entity3 , but when news of her death became public last april , donations to her @entity131 page rocketed			1
within days , the total raised was more than £ 500,000			0
to date almost £ 1.2million has been pledged in her memory , and the @entity107 said several projects had been established in her name			0
to donate , go to @entity138 mr @entity23 told the inquest that @entity45 had taken the supplement once before but ‘ never really got on with it ’			2
‘ she said she was going to take one scoop of it in her water bottle and if she hit a wall she would take it to give her a boost			0
’ an off - duty paramedic said she saw @entity148 , who ‘ appeared tired and was slowing down ’ just before she collapsed			0
dr @entity149 , an @entity150 consultant at @entity151 who tried to save @entity45 , said @entity21 had been linked to the deaths of two @entity38 soldiers			1
she added : ‘ it would give someone a racing heart , increasing heart rate and make the heart work much harder than it naturally would			0
’ @entity21 has also been linked with high blood pressure , headaches , vomiting and strokes			1
professor @entity163 , medical director of the @entity3 , said : ‘ no - one , particularly athletes doing strenuous exercise , should take this supplement or indeed any performance - enhancing drugs			0
it should not be available to be bought either from shops or over the internet			0
‘ this is a tragedy that inadvertently cost a young girl her life			0
’ huge event : @entity6 was one of 37,000 people who lined up at the start line of the annual race video : @entity3 runner 's death blamed on supplement banned : @entity21 contains a stimulant called @entity21 @entity21 contained a stimulant known as @entity21 ( dimethylamylamine ) that has been linked to high blood pressure , headaches , vomiting , stroke and even death			1
the @entity22 ’s medicines watchdog @entity191 ( @entity191 ) ruled last august that it is unlicensed and that all other @entity21 containing products needed to be removed from the market to protect public safety			1
although @entity21 is not illegal to take or possess in the @entity22 it is no longer licensed so can not be sold			1
the decision followed similar warnings around the world , including in the @entity38 and @entity200 where a man died after buying @entity21 online			1
@entity21 is said to boost energy , concentration and metabolism			2
but @entity21 , most commonly used as a workout aid or dietary supplement , can have a physiological effect on the body by narrowing the arteries and raising the heart rate , said the @entity191			2
this has been linked to suspected adverse drug reactions worldwide , ranging from shortness of breath to heart attacks			0
an @entity191 spokesperson said at the time : ' @entity21 is mainly bought over the internet although it is also available in sports stores specialising in work out products			1
' if we find a shop selling it we will send them a written reminder asking them to remove it from their shelves			0
if they ignore this then our enforcement officers will move in and begin legal action			0
' it is the most popular sports supplement in the @entity22 because it is a stimulant that allows you to work out for longer			2
' but it is for people who are really into their fitness			0
your average person who goes to the gym once or twice a week is unlikely to have ever used it			0
' a spokesman for the @entity191 told @entity242 today it had tried to take it off the @entity22 market prior to last august but it was delayed by an appeal from one of the retailers of the product .			1
