by @entity0 by ’ eck it were steep			2
but even 40 years after @entity3 first pushed his baker ’s - boy bike up the dauntingly mountainous hill , he could n’t resist doing it again for old time ’s sake			1
and so , with a full basket of bread – and a considerable amount of middle - age huff and puff – he donned his cloth cap and set off up the most famous cobbled street in tv advertising			1
he is reminiscing about his days as a youngster when he did his bread round			2
to the sound of a brass band playing @entity38 's @entity37 , he states : ' last stop on round would be @entity42 's place			2
' t'was like taking bread to top of the world			0
' t'was a grand ride back though			0
i 'd knew baker have kettle on and doorsteps of old @entity21 ready			0
' " there 's wheatgearm in that loaf , " he 'd day			0
" get it inside you boy and you 'll be going up that hill as fast as you come down			0
' " the boy is seen in the advert struggling to push his bike to the top of the hill but is sat astride it and joyously freewheeling down it after making the delivery			2
he is then seen returning to the bakery and tucking into @entity21 bread			0
the @entity21 delivery lad was back in business			0
not to recreate the nation ’s best - loved ad though , but as a celebrity invited to turn on a town ’s @entity73 lights			1
he was 13 and at stage school in 1973 when he first scaled the hill to star in a commercial that earned itself a slice of @entity29 history			2
the short film by @entity81 – now an @entity84 - nominated @entity83 director – shows @entity3 slogging up the one - in - four gradient to a brass - band soundtrack of @entity38 ’s @entity37 , set against the backdrop of a fictional northern industrial town			1
fictional , because it was actually filmed on picturesque @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , one of the steepest residential streets in @entity29 and hundreds of miles from the grime and belching smoke of a bygone age up @entity96			1
it showed @entity3 with a pudding basin haircut beneath a flat cap , struggling with the fully laden bike to deliver a loaf to @entity103 ’s house at the top of the hill			1
in triumph , he then freewheels down at breakneck speed with his legs splayed out from the pedals			0
the advert won a clutch of accolades and was voted more than three decades later as @entity29 ’s all - time favourite			1
mr @entity3 was invited back to the @entity115 village this week to turn on its @entity73 lights although he was paid handsomely for his endeavours ( £ 60 ) , he did not go on to make the big time , preferring instead to earn his crust as a fireman			1
he recently retired from @entity121 after a 30 - year career			1
but the people of @entity23 never forgot the young lad who helped to put @entity22 on the tourist map			1
on monday they afforded him vip status to switch on the festive lights , and yesterday he recalled his moment of stardom			1
mr @entity3 said : ' the advert has been such a big part of my life and it really captured the hearts of the nation ' ‘ three boys were auditioned , ’ he said			1
‘ one could n’t ride a bike , one was n’t prepared to cut his hair , and i was happy to do both			0
‘ it was cold , but i soon warmed up – i had to push the bike up the hill many times for the best part of two days filming			0
’ he admitted that doing it again was more of a slog at the age of 54			2
surely going downhill was fun though ? ‘ i would n’t even consider doing it now , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s far too steep			0

@entity3 was 13 when he pushed his bicycle up @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24
now 54 , he *retraced* footsteps while in village to switch on @entity73 lights
