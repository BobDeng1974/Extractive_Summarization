the morning after she so memorably sashayed through @entity2 clad in a cream silk dress that showcased her famous derrière , the world seemed to be @entity7 's oyster			1
not only had the @entity8 of @entity10 's younger sister come dangerously close to upstaging her older sibling , her obvious lust for life and ever - ready smile swiftly won her admirers from across the social spectrum			2
but almost four years on from the @entity18 of april 2011 , things are looking very different for 31 - year - old miss @entity7			1
writing in the @entity32 at the time , reviewer @entity31 pointed to her less than original ideas ( pumpkins at @entity36 anyone ? ) and her lack of any obvious qualifications beyond penning the blog on her parents ' @entity40 website			0
' from the moment she appeared in butter satin at her sister ’s wedding , @entity7 has struck absolutely no one as the kind of girl you would always find in the kitchen at parties , ' continued @entity52			1
' and would she really have gained a lucrative publishing contract to write about something she calls " simple , creative entertaining " if her sister were not married to a member of the @entity57 ? ' it was n't the first time that the question had been asked and it certainly would n't the last			0
@entity61 came news of a column for @entity64 , which launched in april 2013 although not before a storm of criticism had broken over both magazine and writer 's heads			1
established chefs were appalled that a woman with no obvious cooking experience had been hired and accused @entity64 of publicity seeking , while @entity7 was once again charged with capitalising on her royal connections			1
at the time , editor @entity75 hit back , arguing that @entity7 ' will be an excellent contributor to the magazine , bringing with her a wealth of experience of entertaining , gained in part from working at her family 's party business			1
' critics disagreed and pointed to the 31 - year - old 's lack of kitchen experience and talent for stating the obvious , with lines such as ' regardless of how tired i might be , the moment friday lunchtime arrives i get that contagious pre-weekend excitement ' widely mocked			0
nevertheless , the @entity7 bandwagon rolled on , with the @entity95 's sister adding a @entity97 column and the role of contributing editor at @entity100 to her cv			1
then it all began to go wrong			0
first , in march 2013 , she was dropped by her literary agent @entity103 who had helped her launch celebrate ! royal relations : @entity7 , left , at the @entity18 and right , at the 2013 christening of @entity108 speaking after the news broke , he said : ' i am very sorry it has happened , but yes , it is true : i no longer represent @entity7 and i wish her every good luck			1
' then , with lacklustre sales uppermost in publisher 's minds , plans for a follow up to celebrate ! were quietly shelved			2
in january 2014 , her @entity120 publisher @entity118 dropped her altogether having sold just 18,000 copies of the book , with a source telling the @entity124 that ' @entity7 's celebrate sales are nothing to celebrate			1
' she was a superstar after the wedding , and everybody thought it would be a success			0
even @entity130 sold more books when she started her writing career			0
' just six months later , in june last year , her @entity97 column , only six articles old , was axed after the paper discovered that its readers ' just were n't into it '			0
a source , speaking at the time , added : ' there was a lot of negative mail coming in after each column and there were too many off - limit subjects for her			0
they ran out of ideas			0
' her @entity100 column , meanwhile , was laughed at , with the 31 - year - old once again accused of trading on her royal connections and of stating the obvious			2
passion : @entity7 's most recent column for @entity100 focused on the best places to ski problems : brother @entity157 , seen at the @entity158 , has also been accused of trading on his royal relations one particularly memorable line in a piece on @entity163 written in june 2014 read : ' @entity164 7 ( which is reserved for @entity166 members ) is also a lovely spot to soak up the atmosphere and watch people , their hats , and general activity pass by			1
' her most recent column focused on where to ski , with @entity175 , @entity176 and royal favourite @entity177 all coming highly recommended			0
but while @entity7 's foray into travel writing went relatively smoothly , her attempt to move into tv is apparently over before it even began			1
wooed by @entity120 broadcaster @entity22 after an interview conducted by host @entity184 proved a ratings winner , attempts to turn her brand of @entity7 magic into something more substantial hit the buffers when she apparently ' failed to convince ' in pilot scenes			1
according to reports over the weekend , talks over a £ 400,000 contract have ' stalled ' with sources describing a scene featuring @entity197 dancing as ' cringe - worthy '			0
not that you would know it from her december 2014 column for the @entity201			2
excitedly describing her visit to @entity203 , @entity7 gushed about her experience of line - dancing and talked of the ' stunning ' mountain scenery			2
' not convincing ' : @entity7 was a ratings hit when she appeared on @entity22 but contract talks have stalled ' @entity203 is real cowboy country , ' she continued			1
' everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big , non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards			0
' not one to claim the laurels undeserved , she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on @entity217			0
' it ’s easy to get carried away with the whole free - riding atmosphere			0
my dance partner was about 80 , and i did my best to keep up , ' she continued			0
' but it turns out i have two left feet , at least as far as moving to rhythm is concerned			0
and yet , sources say that the breakdown of talks is n't only because of @entity7 's ' two left feet '			1
indeed , as the more charitably minded have pointed out , she has plenty going for her in the @entity228 - a factor that has made her reluctant to relocate to @entity230			2
that she is so attached to @entity232 has more than a little to do with the increasingly busy role she has taken on at the @entity234 , a charity which she has long championed			0
taking priority : @entity7 has taken on an increasingly busy role at the @entity234 love : @entity237 lives in @entity238 and friends say @entity7 was reluctant to put more distance between them then there 's boyfriend @entity242 , 36 , who has been part of her life since 2012 , but lives in @entity238 - friends say she was reluctant to make the distance between them even larger			1
more reasons to stay include her job editing @entity250 , the online magazine belonging to her parents ' company @entity40 , and her continuing work for the @entity201 and @entity64			1
next month , @entity7 will become an aunt for the second time when her sister gives birth to a brother or sister for @entity108			2
in june , she has another big engagement coming up , leading the @entity232 to @entity262 charity bike ride as part of her work for the @entity234			0
indeed , it seems there 's no shortage of things to keep @entity7 , whose company recently posted a healthy £ 220,000 profit , busy			2
she might have lost a column and a £ 400,000 deal with @entity22 but while she is no longer the fresh - faced ingenue who burst onto the scene so memorably in 2011 , the younger @entity7 sister clearly is n't beaten yet .			1

@entity7 was seen as a breath of fresh air when she first appeared
became famous after nearly upstaging her sister during @entity18
was handed columns in @entity100 , @entity64 and the @entity201
but was *dumped* by her publisher after her party book failed to do well
talks between her and @entity120 broadcaster @entity22 have apparently broken down
@entity7 's attempt at presenting has been described as ' not convincing '
still has two columns and is *patron* of the @entity234
friends say talks broke down because @entity7 *wanted* to remain in the @entity228
