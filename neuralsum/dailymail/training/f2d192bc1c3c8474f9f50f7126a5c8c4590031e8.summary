by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 have completed the signing of @entity5 striker @entity4 for a fee in the region of £ 6million			1
the 24 - year - old put the finishing touches to his move at the @entity11 ’ @entity13 training base on wednesday			0
but despite being @entity5 's top marksman last term , very little is known of @entity4			1
here , @entity16 tells you more ... video : scroll down to watch @entity4 joins @entity2 another one ! @entity2 have added to their @entity20 contingent with the signing of @entity4 well then , who is he ? @entity4 is a 24 - year - old striker – born on the @entity20 - ruled @entity24 island of @entity25 - who has played for @entity27 at every level up to and including under - 21 , where he scored six times from 15 appearances			1
what is his club record like ? since moving to @entity5 in january of last year for a fee of around £ 3.5m , he has proved a one - in - three striker , returning 17 goals from 50 outings			1
he helped the cash - rich club to promotion in his first season but was in and out of the side last time around			0
his record before moving to the principality was n’t quite as impressive goals wise ; 19 from 85 for first club @entity47 and 10 from 47 for @entity48			2
how did he do last season ? well , he was @entity5 ’s top scorer in @entity50 with 10 goals – he bagged six in six at the start of the campaign - as they finished second to @entity55			1
to take that prize he beat off competition from @entity59 winner @entity58 and his @entity61 compatriot @entity60 , both of whom scored nine			0
@entity60 , in fairness , missed the second half of the season with a knee - ligament injury but @entity4 still netted his 10 from just 19 starts			2
@entity69 joins @entity2 competition : @entity59 winner @entity58 is @entity5 's star player price tag : the striker cost @entity2 in the region of £ 6m what sort of player are @entity2 getting ? the first thing to mention is his blistering pace and a lot of @entity4 ’s goals have seen him spring clear of the last defender			1
he is a physical type and can mix it with his minders as well as leaving them in his wake			0
he has likened himself to @entity88 , so clearly does n’t want for confidence and self - belief			0
any weaknesses ? it is said his finishing could be improved but , on the evidence of last season , he has started to sharpen that side of his game and nine of his goals were sniffed out inside the penalty area			0
there was one effort against @entity104 , in particular , where he rolled his marker before hooking into the far corner , leaving the goalkeeper with no chance			0
strength : @entity4 has a blistering turn of foot and enjoys a physical battle where will he fit in at @entity2 ? @entity2 ’s lack of striking options – they have the out - of - favour and out - of - form @entity116 and @entity120 youngster @entity119 – means they ’re likely to start with one up front next season and that man should be @entity4			2
at 24 his best years are ahead of him and @entity2 scout @entity123 has a proven track record of unearthing gems from @entity50			0
how did he end up in the @entity126 ? @entity4 has never hidden his desire to play in the @entity129 but , having talked of a ‘ dream ’ move to @entity131 , it was @entity2 , @entity133 and @entity134 chasing his signature this summer			1
@entity5 , with the fit - again @entity60 , @entity59 star @entity58 and @entity136 ahead of him in the pecking order were willing to sell and @entity2 matched their £ 6m asking price .			2

@entity20 striker is @entity142 's sixth signing of the summer
he was @entity5 's top scorer last season with 10 goals
he is quick and strong and could lead @entity2 's attack in the @entity129
