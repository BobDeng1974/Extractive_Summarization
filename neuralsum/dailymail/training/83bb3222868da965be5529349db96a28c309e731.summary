@entity0 may still be without a @entity2 goal since september , but the 20 - year - old can be pleased with his contribution following @entity6 's 2 - 2 draw against @entity7			1
sitting at the very top of @entity10 ' 3 - 4 - 3 system , @entity0 looked a constant threat during the first 45 minutes despite losing his early exchanges with @entity7 defenders @entity13 and @entity15			0
the @entity16 international spent most of the initial period drifting across the line and found space well , often pointing to where he wanted the likes of @entity23 to play the ball			0
meanwhile , after a poor first 30 minutes from @entity48 's side , @entity32 was switched to the left as the visitors reverted to a 4 - 4 - 2 with @entity51 and @entity52 coming away from the wing to help lead the line			0
the @entity55 seemed to attempt a dive midway through the first half after a tackle from @entity59 only for the ball to run out of play and referee @entity57 waved play on			0
@entity0 enjoyed a 100 per cent pass completion rate during the first 45 minutes while @entity32 made four more successful passes @entity0 ( left ) was heavily involved during the first half which ended 1 - 1 between the @entity2 rivals @entity0 led the line for @entity10 ' side , but spent much of his time out on the left just as @entity0 had indirectly helped his side take the lead , @entity32 was sure to have a say in @entity7 's equaliser just two minutes later			1
the @entity55 forward , who played the majority of the game from the right , won a promising free - kick for the @entity78 following a sharp turn away from @entity80			2
@entity32 's resulting free - kick may have been a poor one , but @entity6 's inability to clear led to @entity84 being allowed enough space to head towards team - mate @entity13 who jumped higher than @entity86 to pull his side back into the game			1
@entity32 seemed to dive after a tackle from @entity59 , but the @entity55 escaped punishment @entity32 struggled to make his usual impact on the game , but still helped his team to three points with @entity10 chasing the game after a second half strike from @entity51 , the @entity96 boss sent on @entity99 , sending @entity0 out into a left wing back position			2
@entity0 once again showed his knack of finding pockets of space in the second half as he ran down the left and unleashed a strike which @entity13 was able to block			0
@entity6 's cause was n't helped by the late red card for @entity99 during a frantic nine added minutes of stoppage time but @entity111 continued to push before @entity86 managed to head home a late leveller			2
@entity7 's @entity55 forward won and took the free - kick which resulted in a goal for the @entity78			1

@entity0 was @entity6 's bright spark during 2 - 2 draw against @entity7
@entity0 *threatened* throughout but failed to find end *product*
@entity32 had quiet game but @entity55 's free - kick led to @entity13 's first half header
@entity86 comes back from horrific head *injury* to score late equaliser
