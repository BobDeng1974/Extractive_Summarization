a dangerous ' death ring ' has been spotted around the @entity1			1
scientists say the lethal ring is leaving tens of thousands of creatures with severe , and often fatal injuries			1
now researchers have released an interactive roadkill map to show the trail of destruction being caused by @entity11 's state highways			1
to view the interactive map , click here pictured are the @entity15 regional highway roadkill hotspots			1
the ring of death refers to an area made up of made up of @entity19 ( labelled as 9 ) and @entity20 101 ( labelled as 13 and 8 ) the map uses data from the @entity23 , a volunteer - submitted database of instances where wildlife and vehicles collided over the past five years			1
it assigns different coloured markers for various sizes of species			1
clicking on the dots reveals the species - striped skunk , mountain lion , black bear , gopher snake , desert iguana - and where and when they were hit			1
animals can also be mapped individually			2
major hotspots include the @entity43 area where @entity19 and i - 5 run across bypasses along the @entity46			1
in the region , marshy areas attract birds during migration resulting in high rates of roadkill			0
where @entity19 and i - 5 run across bypasses along the @entity46 , marshy areas attract birds during migration and result in high rates of roadkill @entity43 area : where @entity19 and i - 5 run across bypasses along the @entity46 , marshy areas attract birds during migration and result in high rates of roadkill			1
@entity1 : ' it 's sort of a ring of death around the @entity1 , ' @entity56 said			1
@entity19 and @entity20 101 run alongside the bay , where high rates of wading birds and water birds are killed			1
large animals are more likely to be hit on @entity65 and @entity66 , particularly near areas of parks and open spaces			2
@entity11 : many areas along @entity71 in @entity72 have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat			1
@entity56 said @entity77 is planning to build five new wildlife - crossing structures in this area because the data demonstrate both an immediate need and locations where structures would be useful			0
@entity84 : highway 70 in @entity86 and near @entity87 has high rates of roadkill , particularly deer			0
@entity91 : both @entity92 and 20 show high rates of collision between @entity95 and @entity96			0
' it 's sort of a ring of death around the @entity1 , ' said @entity56 at the @entity100 , who led the study			1
@entity19 and @entity20 101 run alongside the bay , where high rates of wading birds and water birds are killed			1
large animals are more likely to be hit on @entity65 and @entity66 , particularly near areas of parks and open spaces			2
meanwhile , many areas along @entity71 in @entity72 have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat			1
@entity85 in @entity86 and near @entity87 also has high rates of roadkill , particularly deer			0
and on the @entity91 , both @entity117 and 20 show high rates of collision between @entity95 and @entity96			0
@entity56 , co-director of the @entity118 at @entity100 , says it is the largest wildlife monitoring system in the state			0
it features more than 29,000 sightings of more than 390 of @entity11 's 680 native vertebrate species			2
the report 's findings cover about 40 per cent of the total state highway system			0
meanwhile , the public are being encouraged to submit entries , including photographs , to add to the map			2
' these data help identify places where immediate action is warranted , ' says @entity56 , who is also a research scientist with the @entity100 department of environmental science and policy			0
according to @entity77 and @entity139 statistics , there are about 1,000 reported accidents each year on state highways involving deer , livestock , and other wildlife			0
there is one long hotspot in the circled area , representing 20 miles of @entity148			0
the 419 roadkill observations of 36 species within the hotspot were collected between april 2011 and october , 2014 many areas along @entity20 94 in @entity72 have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat the drought may be increasing the number of roadkill , as animals seem to be putting themselves at greater risk to find food and water sources , crossing roads they may not have in the past			1
while deer tend to use landscape ' corridors ' when migrating , most other species do not appear to be using them			2
landscape corridors , also known as wildlife corridors , are strips of land intended to connect parks and other wildlife reserves			0
but the roadkill data suggest that most animals tend to cross where they can , regardless of the location of these corridors			2
birds are among the most common wildlife group types killed by road collisions			0
for instance , there is a high rate of barn owl roadkill where @entity190 runs through agricultural lands of the @entity192			0
without trees or other elevated structures by the highways , the owls swoop down for prey without considering the trucks and other vehicles coming toward them			0
in what has not always been a popular suggestion , @entity56 recommends for these areas planting vegetation such as oleander and ice plant , non-native species that repel rather than attract wildlife to the roadsides			2
' you have a sterile , dangerous place - the roadway , ' @entity56 says			0
' you do n't want to attract animals there			0
' the drought may be increasing the number of roadkill , as animals seem to be putting themselves at greater risk to find food and water sources , crossing roads they may not have in the past the long continuous hotspot represents 681 roadkill observations of 57 animal species			1
this isout of a total for the highway of 899 observations of 66 total species collected by 7 roadkillobservers , between october 2010 and october 2014			0

death ring is made up of @entity19 and @entity20 101 which run beside the bay
other hotspots include @entity43 and @entity20 94 in @entity72
the map uses different coloured markers to *highlight* the species at risk
scientists believe the drought has caused animals to take bigger risks
