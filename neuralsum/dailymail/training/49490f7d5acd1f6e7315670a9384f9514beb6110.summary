by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 10:49 est , 14 august 2013 from a transsexual @entity2 to a nude scratching her itchy armpit , these paintings are so bad they are good			2
once destined for the trash , they were saved by a lover of odd paintings and are now on display to thousands of visitors a year at a museum dedicated to the worst art in the world			1
the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , has now grown to three galleries and houses a collection of 600 terrible pieces			1
the museum is the only one on the @entity41 dedicated to seriously awful art. @entity43 , executive director of the museum , said : ' our curators receive at least 20 submissions every month - but only about four or five make it into our collection			1
' the museum only accepts artwork that is sincere and original			0
' we look for pieces in which something has gone wrong - it can be the work of a skilled artist who was trying something new or made an unfortunate decision			1
' or it can be created by an artist who barely knows which end of the brush to hold			0
bizarre : a woman in a bikini stands unfazed stands in flames and this painting of a smiling woman gives her ' an air of frumpiness ' atmospheric : the baseball game painting is celebrated for the batter 's asymmetrical limbs and flexible bat haunting : the face ( left ) is the artist 's portrait of his partner @entity76 while the portrait ( right ) is an unflattering likeness of @entity79 ' in any case , the work must be interesting and compelling			0
we favour pieces that are clearly meant to communicate something to the viewer			1
' among the esteemed pieces are an unflattering portrait of @entity88 starlet @entity79 , an @entity89 woman who suffers an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction and two naked giants holding airplanes			1
the jewel in the crown is ' @entity95 ' , which inspired antiques dealer @entity25 to found the museum with his friend @entity97			0
he found the painting - of an elderly woman walking through a field of flowers - in a rubbish bin and realised it was so bad it was good			0
the piece is a commissioned portrait of @entity107 that hung proudly in the family home until her daughter 's death			0
the painting became the first in mr @entity25 and mr @entity97 's collection of odd works of art that would never find their way into a traditional gallery			1
family : the museum praised the ' astonishing emphasis on facial bone structure ' in ' @entity123 and @entity124 ' portrait of innocence : a young girl , dressed in white and wearing a straw hat , picks daisies in a green field provocative : a nude who ' can scratch her back and armpit simultaneously ' ( left ) and two naked giants play with blimps and planes ( right ) disaster - pieces : an @entity89 woman suffers an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction after sneezing the museum now attracts about 8,000 people a year who visit to see the art and the synopses written underneath by the curators			1
the inscription below @entity95 reads : ' the motion , the chair , the sway of her breast , the subtle hues of the sky , the expression on her face - every detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait , every detail cries out " masterpiece			0
" ' ms @entity43 said they write out of respect to the artist			0
she said : ' we are the first institution to collect , exhibit , and celebrate these works that would otherwise never receive the recognition they deserve			2
' we do this while being respectful of the artists , and offering our interpretations of these heartfelt pieces in which something has gone awry			2
' everyone has the experience of walking past a gallery when a friend says " wow ! look at that			2
" ' until you turn to look , you do n't know if it will be very good or very bad			0
either way , people want to share and talk about these pieces			2

the @entity14 attracts thousands of visitors a year
gallery the only one in the @entity41 to celebrate poor art and now has 600 pieces
receives about 20 submissions a month but only *chooses* five
