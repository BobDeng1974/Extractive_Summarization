with 11 children and 11 grandchildren , life for @entity1 , 43 , from @entity2 , used to be a struggle to make ends meet			1
but seven years after moving to @entity7 in @entity8 , mrs @entity1 says life is ' very nice ' - and it 's all down to the £ 430 a week she receives from the taxpayer			1
what 's more , mrs @entity1 , who has worked for a grand total of one month in seven years , says she has no plans to find work and spends her time caring for her grandchildren instead			1
shameless : @entity1 , 43 , came to the @entity19 seven years ago but has had a job for just one month and she is n't the only one			1
although husband @entity23 , a builder by trade , has had the odd job , he has n't worked for two years while all but one of mrs @entity1 's 11 children are unemployed and living on benefits			1
' we have a good life here , ' says an unrepentant mrs @entity1 , whose £ 24,000 annual income is six times what she would have received in @entity2			1
' we have everything that we want here			0
we did n't have flats like this [ council house ] in @entity2			2
we did n't have electricity or radiators			0
we did n't have anything - anything ! ' ' my country no have job , no food ... nothing , ' adds her husband			2
' no. i 'm not going back - no , not ever			0
i like it here in @entity50			0
big family : in the @entity19 with mrs @entity1 is her husband @entity23 and their 11 children and 11 grandchildren handouts : daughter @entity56 , 20 , lives in a nearby council house with her son @entity23 and is handed £ 650 a month ' @entity50 give me house , give me doctor , school , benefit			1
thank you so much @entity50			0
' daughter @entity56 , 20 , lives in a council house nearby with her son @entity23 , three , and also lives on handouts , which in her case , total £ 650 a month			1
' i get child benefit , tax credit , housing benefit , ' she says happily			0
' i 've got a better life here than in my country			0
i 'm never going to go back to @entity2 , never			1
' ' @entity50 is good , ' adds her father			0
' my country no good			0
no jobs , no anything			0
too many people from @entity2 coming @entity50 because my country no have job			1
' i go from my country			0
i have no house , i have nothing			0
i am very , very happy			0
' unfortunately for mrs @entity1 , her reluctance to find work has n't gone unnoticed by the job centre , which has threatened to cut her benefits - much to her fury			1
no work : @entity91 , right , is a builder by trade but has been unemployed for more than two years tension : @entity7 is home to an estimated 6,000 @entity97 gypsies - the cause of much tension in recent months ' it 's not fair to suspend money like this , ' she fumes			1
' is it right to do that ? no ! every time i go to sign on , they come up with something ... all the time			0
i am so cross ! so cross ! ' luckily , help is at hand in the form of the @entity113 , a community development charity with branches all over the @entity19			2
in @entity7 , much of the development work involves helping newcomers to settle in , which as translator @entity118 explains , often means helping them claim benefits			1
' @entity1 comes here quite often , ' he explains			2
' we try to help her with making phonecalls or filling in forms			0
' he adds : ' she has been suspended a few times from the @entity128 [ jobseekers allowance ] payments and the reason is that she is not actively looking for a job			0
' the problem with them is that they have been here a long time but they are not mixing with non @entity97 people			0
you have to go out there and try to learn @entity141			1
' hard times : according to translator @entity118 , many are trying to get a job but others want to live on benefits difficult : local paper , the @entity148 , has called for curbs on migrants as a result of tension not that mrs @entity1 needs to			1
@entity7 has one of the largest @entity97 populations in the @entity19 , with an estimated 6,000 already living in the city - the cause of tension earlier this year between locals and incomers			1
so why the @entity19 and why @entity7 ? according to @entity118 , benefits are a huge draw			1
' because the @entity19 is in the @entity162 , we [ @entity97 ] can work or claim benefits			1
' the @entity19 is a welcoming country , an easy country to be in			2
i think it 's easier to claim benefits here than in our countries , so if we have people in here , we help them to claim benefits			2
' but , he adds , not every @entity97 migrant has travelled to the @entity19 purely to benefit from taxpayer - funded handouts			1
' not every @entity97 is the same , ' he explains			0
' there are plenty of @entity97 people here trying to live better lives free of discrimination and racism and who are hard working			2
' then there are other @entity97 who may be abusing the system			0
and do n't get me wrong , there are some of the @entity19 people who could say " they do n't do nothing " and stuff like that			1
' a few of those people have got a point actually ... we 've got people here who are just on the take and the make			0
' among them is mrs @entity1 , who , thanks to @entity118 's efforts on her behalf , has managed to evade having her benefits cut once more			2
' she will get paid job seekers allowance of £ 500 a month , ' beams daughter @entity56			2
' very nice ! ' adds her delighted mother			0
the @entity1 family appear on @entity208 : life on the @entity210 , monday at 9pm on @entity211			2

@entity1 , 43 , moved to the @entity19 from @entity2 seven years ago
lives on handouts of £ 430 a week and **refuses** to look for work
in total , has worked for one month since arriving in @entity7
has had problems because she **refuses** to speak or learn @entity141
husband and 10 of her 11 children are also unemployed and on benefits
says she and her family , *including* 11 grandchildren , will never go back
@entity162 rules mean @entity233 have same rights to benefits as @entity19 people
