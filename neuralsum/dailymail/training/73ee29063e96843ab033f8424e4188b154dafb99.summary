by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity3 is reviewing its arms exports to @entity5 following the upsurge of violence in @entity8 , @entity2 said yesterday			1
over the past four years , arms export licences worth £ 42million have been granted to 130 @entity3 defence manufacturers to sell military equipment to @entity5			1
the equipment has included ammunition , drones and armoured vehicles , as well as weapon control and targeting systems , bullet - proof garments and naval gun parts			1
pictured are @entity5 soldiers firing a mortar shell towards the @entity8 in response to the crisis in @entity8 , however , the government has now established a review to check whether pending exports should go ahead			1
yesterday , @entity28 responded to the deadly attack on a school in @entity8 by saying that international law stated that schools and civilian targets should not be targeted			2
but he declined to say whether he believed the @entity5 had targeted the school , where 10 died , or whether the country ’s actions were ‘ criminal ’			1
it comes following a simmering row between the @entity39 and @entity40 over what @entity41 described as the prime minister ’s ‘ silence ’ over the action in @entity8			0
over the weekend , the @entity40 leader criticised mr @entity28 for his failure to tell @entity5 its conduct had been ‘ unacceptable and unjustifiable ’			1
but the conservatives hit by back by saying his ‘ ultra-critical ’ comments would hamper the search for peace			0
export : the equipment has included ammunition , drones and armoured vehicles , as well as weapon control and targeting systems , bullet - proof garments and naval gun parts the row came as an @entity5 strike killed 10 and wounded 35 at a @entity67 school in the town of @entity69 , which was being used as a shelter for people displaced by the 27 - day conflict between @entity5 and @entity73			1
on sunday , @entity67 secretary - general ban ki - moon described the attack as a ‘ moral outrage and a criminal act ’ and called for those responsible for the ‘ gross violation of international humanitarian law ’ to be held accountable			0
speaking yesterday , mr @entity28 said : ‘ i think the @entity67 is right to speak out in the way that it has , because international law is very clear that there must not be the targeting of civilians or the targeting of schools if that is what has happened			2
‘ the @entity67 as the international body is right to speak out in the way it has			0
’ but the prime minister declined to make the same accusations himself			0
pressed on whether he regarded the attack as a ‘ criminal act ’ , he told the @entity96 : ‘ i ’m not an international lawyer , so that ’s up to international lawyers			0
aftermath : @entity28 responded to the deadly attack on a @entity67 school in @entity8 ( pictured ) by saying that international law stated that schools and civilian targets should not be targeted ‘ but international law is very , very clear that the use of force always has to be proportionate and civilians should not be targeted			0
’ he added : ‘ we obviously do think it is appalling the loss of life that there has been			0
from the start , though , we have also made the point that if the @entity73 rocket attacks on @entity5 stop then that would be probably the fastest way to stop this conflict			2
’ pressed on whether there was a case for reviewing arms exports to @entity5 in light of the conflict , mr @entity28 ’s official spokesman said this work was already underway			1
‘ we are currently reviewing all existing export licenses to @entity5 , ’ she said			1
‘ clearly each one is assessed on a case - by - case basis anyway when it ’s granted , against strict criteria			2
we have one of the most rigorous systems in the world for licensing arms			2
’ she described the @entity69 attack as a ‘ particularly appalling incident ’ , adding that it was ‘ not appropriate to be attacking people who are seeking shelter ’			0
international development secretary @entity140 said the @entity3 is to provide an extra £ 2million in emergency assistance to help provide mattresses , blankets , nappies , cooking equipment and other essential supplies for nearly 8,000 families who have fled the conflict in @entity8			1
‘ however vital the food , water and shelter that we are providing , ultimately we need an immediate and unconditional ceasefire which is respected by all sides , ’ she said			0
‘ only when the fighting stops can people begin to address some of the underlying causes of this conflict			0
