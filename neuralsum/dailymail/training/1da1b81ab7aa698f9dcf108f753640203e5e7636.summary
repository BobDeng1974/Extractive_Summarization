@entity4 has since been released on $ 10,000 bond			2
‘ there was a report of a man who completely and totally did not match my client 's description as the alleged purse snatcher , ’ his attorney , @entity35 , told the @entity36			2
‘ it makes me wonder what is going on out there in @entity17			0
’ @entity4 was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the armed robbery of a @entity49 worker in @entity50 , just north of @entity17 , in 2000			1
he was arrested last year when it was discovered he was never sent to prison for a robbery conviction in a clerical mistake			1

@entity4 later started his own carpentry business , married , had children , coached youth football and volunteered at his church in @entity80 , a suburb of @entity17			1
when prison officials found the clerical error in july 2013 , as @entity4 's prison term was set to end , eight @entity82 marshals were sent to his home and took him to prison			1
he remained in jail until may			0
‘ you 've been a good father , ’ judge @entity89 said during a hearing may 5 , when he set @entity4 free			1
‘ you 've been a good husband			0
you 've been a good taxpaying citizen of the state of @entity3			0
‘ that leads me to believe that you are a good man and a changed man			0
’ speaking to @entity96 monday , @entity4 's father , @entity95 , said that his son was taken into custody upon leaving his employer ’s birthday party			1
past sins : @entity4 was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the armed robbery of a @entity49 worker in @entity50 in 2000 ' he did n't do it , ' said mr @entity4			1
' he was with 40 other people the entire evening			0
' @entity108 's lawyer reiterated that his client has a solid alibi , given that he had been at the party the entire night and left to go home with his wife only at around 1am			2
attorney @entity35 also took issue with the purse snatcher 's description , saying that according to police , the suspect was a black male dressed in a hoodie and @entity121 sneakers , while @entity108 was wearing a leather jacket , slacks and light brown boots that night			2
the lawyer noted that his client did not have the victim 's purse or any of her other personal effects in his possession at the time of his arrest			2
mr @entity35 and @entity4 's family have suggested that his checkered past and the notoriety surrounding his release have swayed the responding police officer to take the 37 - year - old man into custody			1
‘ the past is never the past , and the reality is , when they run his name and they see this in his record , he 'll never get the benefit of the doubt , ’ said the lawyer			0
on monday evening , circuit attorney @entity148 released a statement saying that the victim of the sunday night mugging identified @entity108 as her assailant on two separate occasions : the first time just steps away from the crime scene on @entity156 , and the second time during a formal police line - up			2
alibi : @entity4 's family and his attorney say that the 37 - year - old man could not have committed the robbery because he had spent the whole night at a birthday party , surrounded by as many as 40 people everything to lose : @entity4 's attorney said his client would not have jeopardized his life and family for a purse also , @entity148 asserted that the victim never described the purse - snatcher as sporting a pair of @entity172 and a hoodie , but rather a leather jacket and boots similar to the ones worn by @entity4 that night			1
@entity35 insisted that his client was ' 100 per cent innocent ' and questioned why the married father of four , who only recently has started putting his life back together , would jeopardize everything for a purse			0
‘ he ’s been working , spending time with the family , going to church , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s been doing very well financially , as a matter of fact			0
a purse snatching involving this individual is completely implausible			0
’ during an appearance on the @entity190 in may , a beaming @entity108 described his reunion with his family as a dream come true			0
' it 's still a dream			0
it has n't really sunk in yet , ’ he said , holding the hand of his wife , @entity60			0
' they got the wrong guy ' : @entity4 's supporters insist that the 37 - year - old man is 100 per cent innocent identified : the victim named @entity4 , seen here with his family , as her assailant just minutes after the robbery , and later picked him out from a police line - up @entity207 associate circuit judge @entity89 needed just a 10 - minute hearing in may before ruling that he was giving @entity54 credit for time served for all 4,794 days between his conviction and when he was arrested last year			1
‘ very happy , ’ @entity4 said as he climbed into an suv for the ride home to suburban @entity17 and a planned family celebration			1
‘ my faith has always been in @entity216			0
i 'm just so thankful			0
’ attorney general @entity218 said in a statement at the time : ‘ from the outset , i have proposed a solution that balances the seriousness of mr. @entity4 's crime with the mistake made by the criminal justice system and mr. @entity4 's lack of a criminal record over the past 13 years			1
today 's outcome appears to appropriately balance the facts as we understand them			0
’ the judge said that rather than grant parole , @entity4 would get credit for the entirety of the time he should have been in prison			1
the distinction is important because it means @entity4 does n't have to report to a parole agent			0
@entity4 had never been convicted of a serious crime before the robbery			2
he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the holdup , then told to wait for orders that would specify when and where he was to report to prison			1
but the orders never came			0
@entity4 suspected that his case had been overlooked and asked his former attorney what to do			2
‘ @entity253 , month by month , year by year , time passed , and they never picked me up , ’ he said in an interview in april with the @entity251			0
a court filing by the attorney general 's office said the mistake happened when a trial court clerk failed to inform the @entity259 that @entity4 was free on bond after his initial conviction .			1
