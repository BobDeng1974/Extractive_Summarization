the perfect camping holiday used to depend on the weather , but since the opening of the world ’s first indoor caravan park , not even the rain can get you down			2
the unique hotel experience can be found in @entity8 , @entity9 where classic caravans and wooden huts have been given a makeover to suit even the choosiest hipster - glamper			1
the @entity14 , or ' @entity16 ' features all the classic caravanning accessories , from ' outdoor ' communal areas to lights in the ‘ trees ’ to help you find your way around the campsite at night			1
it is located in an old vacuum cleaner factory where the pair have incorporated the static wooden cabins and mobile touring caravans in place of traditional hotel rooms			2
@entity30 said : ‘ we wanted to preserve the integrity of the building but also create a communal atmosphere for guests where people can actually meet each other			0
‘ we thought about a ' room - in - room concept ' and decided to build little wooden cabins in the hall			2
' retro sleep : the 70s style caravan on the right comes complete with a table and orange chairs on the ' grass ' in the fake garden out front outside but inside : although it may lack the fresh air of the outdoors , there is no risk of rain , hail or snow mobile home : the interior has been stripped out of the caravan and it has been converted into a cozy double - bed ‘ but we wanted more flexibility inside the place so it could be used for events of all kind as well so decided to put wheels under the cabins			0
‘ it was then we realised there are already cabins with wheels - caravans			0
' before we knew it we had three caravans in @entity82			0
’ that 70s show : no ultimate hipster experience in @entity8 would be complete without staying in a 70s inspired cabin			1
just do n't forget your moustache wax into the cave : one caravan has been covered in white stone mosaic off the rails : if a life on wheels feels a bit too wild and crazy , the hotel offers wooden cabins safely the ground the pair have stripped the caravans of all the original utilities and redecorated each one with its own unique theme			0
one of them has been completely transformed into a cocoon - like hideaway with a wooden mosaic interior while another has been beautifully lit and fitted with a full size double bed			0
the third caravan has been provided with its own scenery , surrounded by birch trees and its residents are spoiled with a view - of the street outside			1
the ' ultimate urban camping ' only costs € 60 a night ( around £ 50 ) and when you feel like breakfast , a little bag of fruit and croissants are hung on one of the branches outside your window .			1

lights hang from trees and there is even a *washing* line - just like a traditional camp site
it is described by the owners in @entity8 , @entity9 , as ' urban camping '
