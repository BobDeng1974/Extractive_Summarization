@entity1 mps could be given a ‘ veto vote ’ over laws which do not apply to the rest of the @entity5 under radical constitutional reforms to be published next week			1
@entity7 will publish proposals aimed at delivering @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws and rectifying the growing imbalance with the devolved nations			1
@entity14 sources said the plans would give @entity1 mps a ‘ decisive say ’ in laws which applied only to their constituents and not to @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
following a committee stage of @entity0 , @entity31 could then be amended by mps from the rest of the @entity5 in the @entity28			0
but @entity1 @entity0 would then get a further veto vote before a @entity31 became law			2
and after @entity38 had previously called for the issue to be referred to a constitutional committee , @entity37 yesterday made its first significant step towards accepting some form of @entity43			1
shadow ministers @entity44 and @entity46 backed the idea of an @entity1 - only committee for @entity31 that will not apply elsewhere in the @entity5 , as it would ‘ strengthen @entity1 ’s voice ’ at @entity50			1
however this option lacks the critical final veto			0
@entity37 yesterday made its first significant step towards accepting some form of @entity43 @entity37 ’s plan was initially suggested by former commons clerk sir @entity55 in his government - commissioned report on the issue last year			1
@entity14 chairman @entity58 said : ‘ the situation since has moved on now that more powers are being devolved to the @entity61 but sir @entity55 himself has questioned whether his proposals are still relevant given the further devolution to @entity18 following the independence referendum			2
he said they would need a ‘ hefty tweak ’			0
a @entity14 source said @entity37 had ‘ spent months denying there was a problem and then latched on to a plan even its author says is outdated ’			2
@entity14 chairman @entity58 said : ‘ the situation since the @entity55 report has moved on now that more powers are being devolved to the @entity61			0
the case for @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws can no longer be ignored and must be delivered			1
‘ and we believe it should happen in tandem with further devolution to @entity18			0
’ he added that @entity37 was simply trying to ‘ kick this issue into the long grass ’			2
details of the government ’s other two proposals were not clear last night			0
however @entity14 backbenchers will be consulted over the plans in the coming weeks , and ministers are negotiating further with @entity92 to put the final choice to a vote before the @entity95			0
last month the @entity96 set out a new deal for @entity18 following its rejection of independence that will see it control income tax , vat revenues and the introduction of new benefits .			0
