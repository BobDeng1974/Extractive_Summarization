the @entity13 immigrant , who was naked except for her gym shoes and socks is thought to be the victim of a serial killer akin to the ' @entity18 ' who killed 16 people over 30 years ago			1
murdered : @entity6 , 26 , was found naked and bound with tape , beneath a bridge in @entity23 , a village near @entity2 , @entity24			1
a man has now been arrested on suspicion of murder and rape since then prostitutes have been lining up at the police station to help bring the killer to justice			1
one , a @entity13 called @entity32 , described her terrifying ordeal after being picked up two years ago from the park @entity35 in @entity2 where she meets her clients			1
she told @entity24 newspaper @entity39 : ‘ i was tortured by that maniac			2
he was like a beast			2
but not even a beast would be capable of such brutality			2
’ the man , who called himself @entity46 , arrived in a light coloured small car before taking her to a field			0
he did n’t initially ask for any special requests , she said			0
‘ but once we arrived he transformed			0
but as soon as he got out of the car he became a monster			0
i ran off but he chased me and caught me			0
at that point i said to him , ‘ i ’ll do what you want			0
’ the scene where the woman 's body was found stripped naked and crucified in a village near @entity2 in @entity24 he told her to strip naked			1
in the car boot there was a wooden pole , some electric cables and tape , she said			0
‘ he tied me to a pole standing up , my arms crossed in front of my face			0

luckily he stopped and got into his car			0
’ she later identified the suspect as a short , chubby , balding man in his 50s with a white car , who spoke @entity24			0
he left the girl bound , taking her clothes , bag , money , phone and everything that she owned			2
but miraculously she managed to free herself after several agonizing hours pulling at the tape with her teeth			0

i would pay any sum to get this person			1
' the net could be closing in as police have found matching dna traces at the scenes of three of his maniacal attacks			1
in all the cases the killer apparently left traces of saliva on the tape that he used to bind his victims , probably as he used his teeth to break the tape			2
@entity150 scientists have found the identical @entity136 in three cases where the maniac has attacked , tortured and raped prostitutes			1
the attacks took place in july 2011 , march 2013 and 21 february 2014 in the @entity2 area			1

offices have begun house - to - house inquiries in a bid to track down ms @entity6 's killer			1
the victim had a criminal record in @entity24 for prostitution , and was identified through her fingerprints			0
sources in the investigation said evidence shows that the dead woman was sexually abused before she was taped to the iron bar and then abandoned			1
the allegations are supported by numerous bruises on her arms and back , showing that she tried hard to free herself			0
ms @entity6 was found by a cyclist beneath a motorway flyover at the end of @entity192 after they spotted her body taped by the wrists to a road barrier , with her head slumped back			1
her clothes and handbag were found half a mile down the road near the @entity202 capital			0

he used a 22 @entity206 gun each time , often then mutilating his female victims , and prayed on couples in lovers ' lanes in and around the picturesque @entity24 city			0
despite four local men – @entity214 , @entity18 , @entity215 , and @entity216 – being arrested , charged , and convicted of the different crimes over the years , it is believed the real perpetrator was never caught			1
the ' monster ' first struck on august 21 , 1968 , when he killed lovers @entity220 , 29 , and @entity222 , 32 , with the gun in @entity224 , a small town to the west of @entity2			1
@entity222 's son @entity227 , six , was asleep in the back seat of the car at the time			0
on september 15 , 1974 , teenage sweethearts @entity231 , a 19 - year - old barman , and @entity233 , an 18 - year - old accountant were shot to death and stabbed in a country lane near @entity237 while having sex in @entity240 's @entity239			1
then on june 6 , 1981 , engaged couple @entity241 , a 30 - year - old warehouseman , and @entity243 , a 21 - year - old shop assistant , were shot to death and stabbed near @entity245 , where they both lived			2

on july 29 , 1984 , sweethearts @entity270 , a 21 - year - old student , and @entity272 , a 18 - year - old barmaid and cheerleader , were shot to death and stabbed in @entity270 's @entity275 parked in a woodland area near @entity277			1
finally , on september 7 – 8 , 1985 , @entity279 lovers on vacation @entity280 , a 25 - year - old musician , and @entity283 , a 36 - year - old tradeswoman , were murdered			2
@entity283 was shot to death and stabbed while sleeping in their small tent in a woodland area near @entity288			0
but @entity280 was killed a short distance away from the tent while trying to escape			0
because they were travelling foreigners nobody reported them missing			0
this led to the killer posting a piece of @entity283 's breast and a taunting note to the state prosecutor , @entity299 , informing her of the murder and setting a challenge to find the victims ' bodies			1
however , ms @entity283 and mr @entity280 's bodies were found a few hours before the letter arrived on the prosecutor 's desk .			1
