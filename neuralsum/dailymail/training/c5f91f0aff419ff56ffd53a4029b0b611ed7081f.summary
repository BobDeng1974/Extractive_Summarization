long - hailed as a role model to @entity1 , @entity4 ’s much - lauded high speed tgv trains are ‘ running out of steam ’ according to a damning report by @entity4 financial watchdogs			1
some 33 years after the launch of the first @entity8 or ‘ high speed train ’ - 40 per cent of the trains still travel on conventional track rather than the specially built high - speed lines			1
watchdogs say the system often fails to meet its key stated aims on what is described as an ‘ incoherent ’ network			1
' running out of steam ' : watchdogs say the high - speed rail network often fails to meet its key stated aims on what is described as an ‘ incoherent ’ network			1
above , a file picture of a @entity25 train these are ‘ to link large population centres , within one and a half to three hours , few or no intermediate stops , a frequent service , a high user rate and good connections to other forms of transport ’			0
the report will make alarming reading for the @entity37 on the day it announced its own ambitious new plans for an @entity41 high speed rail – dubbed @entity42 – in addition to the already controversial planned @entity44			1
@entity4 ’s @entity45 blamed local authorities for pressuring the state to allow the @entity25 to pass through their towns , creating an ‘ incoherent ’ network			1
as a result , there are now a total 230 tgv stations across @entity4 , many on lines which are loss - making for the state - run @entity55 company			2
in the @entity1 cities like @entity58 and @entity59 have also been pressing to be part of @entity1 ’s high speed network , with @entity62 wanting a stop in the city centre rather than at the @entity66 out - of - town shopping centre			0
alarming : the report was released a day after the @entity37 announced its own plans for an @entity41 high speed rail – dubbed @entity42			1
above , @entity69 pictured today after a conference on the rail network @entity4 ’s @entity45 highlighted a steady drop in @entity25 profitability since 2008			2
decision - making processes are only ‘ partly rational ’ in the cases of the @entity78 - @entity77 line , which is due to open in 2017 at an estimated cost of £ 7billion			0
£ 7billion is also the mooted cost of the @entity42 route from @entity59 to @entity82 via @entity83 and @entity84			0
@entity4 auditors recommended a gradual reduction in the number of @entity25 stops , improved planning and greater transparency with passenger statistics			0
@entity4 ’s state - owned rail operator @entity55 is already considering closing some stations			0
but a @entity4 business website says the rail company is also considering increasing first class fares and putting restrictions on ticket refunds and exchanges in standard class , and axing the buffet car , in a bid to restore profitability			0
the @entity4 rail users ’ association vice-chairman @entity105 , told @entity106 on sunday that axing high speed stations was “ going in the wrong direction ’ and would complicate things for the traveller ’			2
it would also be ‘ scandalous ’ if @entity55 changed its ticket policy and scrapped the buffet cars , he said .			0
