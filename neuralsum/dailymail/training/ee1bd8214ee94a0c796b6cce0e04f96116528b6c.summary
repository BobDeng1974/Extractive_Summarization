since the car radio was born 85 years ago there 's been one golden rule - the driver picks the music			1
now that could finally be about to change , thanks to technology which reportedly splits the family saloon into four ' personal sound zones ' with no need for headphones			1
it works by having an array of speakers - in headrests and the car roof , for example - which direct a different set of sound waves towards each ' corner ' of the car			1
pioneering : the rule of ' my car , my music ' could finally be over - thanks to a set of headphones which can reportedly split the family saloon into four ' personal sound zones ' each with noise - cancelling technology noise - cancelling systems , which are already common in personal headphones , then monitor unwanted background noise in each corner and add ' inverse ' sound waves to cancel it out			1
such technology has been a long - held dream of audio engineers across the world , and a more primitive prototype was unveiled by @entity44 researcher dr @entity43 in 2013			1
dr @entity43 , of the @entity46 at the @entity47 , said his system provided two ' listening zones ' - one for the front seats and one for the back			2
but the latest system is said to promise four zones - a major coup if so for its designer @entity55 , a @entity58 audio firm which provides stereos to names including @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
details of the new system are scant but it features today in the @entity69 , where it is claimed @entity55 will unveil it this week at the @entity71 in @entity72			1
fight : music choices prompt regular rows on road trips - though getting lost is still worse ( posed by models ) the effect , researchers claim , will be a car where each passenger listens to their own choice of music but can still hold a conversation over the din			1
the background noise could be cut by 20 decibels , equal to reducing a normal voice in conversation to a whisper			2
according to the @entity69 report , the system could go into production in as little as a year - though it is so far unclear what it would cost			0
@entity93 , @entity55 's general manager of global automotive audio , told the newspaper : ' today , when a navigation prompt comes on , it interrupts the music for everyone			2
' now only the driver will hear " @entity100 left in 100ft "			0
the music does n't stop for other passengers '			0
based in @entity103 , @entity104 - the down - on - its - luck former heart of the @entity58 car industry - @entity55 employs more than 16,000 people and made sales of £ 3.65billion last year			0
sit down ! researchers say drivers could soon hear sat nav instructions only for their corner of the car its revelation could help stop arguments over music , cited by an @entity120 survey as the eight - biggest cause of in - car fights after driving too fast and not knowing the route			2
getting it in your current car might be a bit tricky , though - since the most advanced hi - fi systems can already cost upwards of £ 10,000			0
dr @entity43 presented his previous theory to a 2013 conference in @entity133 , @entity134			0
he said at the time it ' would allow , for example , the driver to listen to a navigation system while the rear passengers watched a film '			0
he added : ' personal audio systems have previously been implemented in mobile devices and monitors , for example , however , the investigation of the effects of an enclosure on the generation of personal listening zones has been limited			0

technology is latest step in race for headphones - free personal music
it will reportedly be unveiled at global conference in @entity72 this week
speakers direct music and noise - cancelling ' inverse ' waves to four areas
