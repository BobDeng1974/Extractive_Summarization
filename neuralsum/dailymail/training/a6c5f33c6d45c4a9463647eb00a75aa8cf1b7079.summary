it was the difference between life and horrific certain death - a decision to use urine from latrine bucket as part of an escape plan , which helped save @entity9 ’s life			2
@entity9 was one of many on a guarded train packed with @entity12 , which left @entity13 and for @entity14 on november 5 , 1943			1
with the latrine overflowing and located in the middle of the floor on the railway cattle wagon headed for the death camp in @entity21 occupied @entity22 , @entity9 used its contents to help him jump from the train , the @entity15 reported			1
he was one of at least 764 people who escaped the @entity25 by leaping from trains , a surprising figure drawn from new research			1
jews wearing the star emblem , arrive in @entity14 , in @entity31 - occupied @entity22 in june 1944 a freight car , used used to transport @entity12 , gypsies and other political prisoners to concentration camps , where many were killed @entity9 , then 21 , and friend @entity36 tried desperately for hours to force apart iron bars a small window in the side of the wagon in the hope they would pass out of them			1
despite their best efforts using pullovers as ropes , the bars refused to give			2
another person on the train proposed they soak the makeshift ropes in urine , as it could strengthen their grip on the bars			2
desperate to escape , @entity9 said he put aside feelings of sickness and nausea in the next steps he took			2
' i bent down and soaked my pullover in urine			2
there were bits of excrement floating in it			2
it was the most disgusting thing i had ever done , ' he said			2
with the fellow passanger 's advice working , @entity9 and his friend successfully pulled the bars far enough apart for them to squeeze their way out			2
but their battle for survival was far from over once they were on the outside the edge of the wagon , with the two young men trying to avoid the guards ' searchlights			1
it was not until the train passed a corner that the pair used a concave shadow to hide them as they jumped			1
getting a second chance at life , the two miraculously survived the escape and risky jump , with @entity9 spending the rest of @entity94 evading the @entity95			0
escape : @entity9 , who died last week at 93 aged 93 , @entity9 died in the @entity97 a week ago , coinciding with new historical research published in @entity21			1
the work tells the unheard stories of about those who cheated death by jumping from @entity21 trains leaving from @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 for death camps			1
historian @entity108 spent four years interviewing people and researching archives in @entity111 and @entity112 for her study @entity114 from @entity115			0
she said was shocked at the number who survived the @entity25 by jumping trains			1
' i was amazed that this happened at all			0
i had always assumed that the wagons were stuffed full prior to departure and simply opened on arrival and that not much could happen in between , ' she said			0
during her research , the author found this was not the case , with desperate attempts by passengers trying to break free from the @entity21 trains with the aid of smuggled tools in some cases , or by people improvising , such as @entity9 with the urine - drenched pullovers			1
but would - be escapees often faced anger from fellow passengers , who feared for their own lives if others successfully got away			1
their concerns were on the back of threats that everyone would be shot if someone escape and fears over who would care for children , the old and the sick			2
this placed the escapees in a deep moral dilemma , torn between leaving someone behind and fighting to live , dr von @entity108 said			1
for this reason , the author said many survivors kept silent in the years following the war , including @entity157 , 82 , kept quite about his jump to freedom for almost 60 years			0

it is believed 2.5 and 4 million people , mostly @entity12 , were killed here by the @entity21 regime until the end of @entity94 in 1945 death camp : the snow - covered train tracks lead to the gas chambers of the @entity14 concentration camp			1
the @entity21 's had the concentration camp established in 1940 and enlarged to an extermination camp in 1941 after hearing about people leaping off trains , he used his bunk bed in the @entity21 camp to practice jumping in preparation for his own escape			1
in march 1943 , @entity157 and his mother were among those packed onto a cattle wagon with @entity14 awaiting them at the end of their journey			0
getting his chance to beat death , the young boy was encouraged by a group of resistance fighter 's raid , which freed 17 @entity12 from the train			1
a group of men in @entity157 ’s wagon were able to force open the door , but with the train building speed , the young boy paused while hesitating			0
taking the jump off the train , his mother ’s last words to him were that the train was going too fast			0
while he survived , his mother was murder in @entity14 shortly after			0
@entity217 was 25 when he was imprisoned aboard an @entity14 transport travelling through @entity105 - but he did not jump			0
part of a group of six young male prisoners , they broke open a cattle wagon window , which enabled them to escape one by one			0
watching anxiously as the person before him climbed through the window , @entity217 was next , but as he pulled himself through , was confronted with a ' horrible sight '			0
' the boy was caught between two wagons and his head had been crushed between the buffers like a melon			0
' @entity217 said in hindsight , if he knew what awaited him in @entity14 , he would have jumped , but unlike thousands of others , he survived the camp			2
@entity157 lost his sister in @entity14 and only resolved his traumatic experiences in 2002 , when he had a reunion with the armed guard who forced him and his family on to the death camp train in 1943			0
