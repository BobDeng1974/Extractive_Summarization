by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 07:34 est , 8 august 2012 drinking a glass of grapefruit juice a day could dramatically increase the effectiveness of cancer drugs , according to a study			1
patients who combined the fruit with a specific anti-cancer drug received the same benefits as they would have from taking more than three times of the medication by itself			1
researchers from the @entity14 said the combination could help patients avoid side effects associated with high doses of the drug and reduce the cost of the medication			1
@entity21 affects the enzymes in the intestine , preventing them from breaking down certain medications grapefruit juice is known to prevent enzymes in the intestine that break down certain drugs , meaning more can enter the blood stream			1
this means doctors often tell patients to avoid the fruit when taking particular medications as it can cause serious side - effects or overdose			1
scientists now wanted to see if they could harness this effect			2
study leader dr @entity40 said : ' grapefruit juice , and drugs with a similar mechanism , can significantly increase blood levels of many drugs			1
' but this has long been considered an overdose hazard			0
instead , we wanted to see if grapefruit juice can be used in a controlled fashion to increase the availability and efficacy of sirolimus			2
' sirolimus or rapamycin is used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation but is also being tested as a treatment for certain tumours			0
in a study published in @entity62 , the @entity60 team showed that patients who drank eight ounces of grapefruit a day increased their sirolimus levels by 350 per cent			1
certain substances in grapefruit juice are known to stop an enzyme in the small intestine from breaking down some medications			1
this allows more of the drug to enter the blood stream and could cause serious side - effects or accidental overdose			1
@entity77 oranges affect the same enzyme			2
while most drugs to not interact there are around 50 that do			0
the affected drugs include some used to treat high cholesterol such as statins , some medications for high blood pressure , depression , pain , erectile dysfunction , @entity90 and allergies			0
always check the medication bottle for potential interactions and check with your gp or pharmacist if you are uncertain			2
for more information visit a drug called ketoconazole that also slows drug metabolism increased sirolimus levels by 500 percent			0
the effect of grapefruit on the enzymes in the intestine begins within a few hours of consumption and gradually wears off over a few days			0
dr @entity40 and colleagues organized three simultaneous phase - 1 trials of sirolimus			0
patients received only sirolimus , sirolimus plus ketoconazole , or sirolimus plus grapefruit juice			0
they enrolled 138 patients with incurable cancer and no known effective therapy			0
the first patients started with very low sirolimus doses , but the amounts increased as the study went on , to see how much of the drug was required in each setting to reach targeted levels , so that patients got the greatest anti-cancer effect with the least side effects			1
the optimal cancer - fighting dose for those taking sirolimus was about 90 mg per week			0
at doses above 45 mg , however , the drug caused serious gastrointestinal problems , such as nausea and diarrhea , so patients taking sirolimus alone switched to 45 mg twice a week			0
the optimal doses for the other two groups were much lower			0
patients taking sirolimus plus ketoconazole , needed only 16 mg per week to maintain the same levels of drug in the blood			1
those taking sirolimus plus grapefruit juice , needed between 25 and 35 mg of sirolimus per week			2
no patients in the study had a complete response , but about 30 percent of patients in the three trials had stable disease , meaning a period when their cancers did not advance			0
one patient receiving grapefruit juice had a partial response - significant tumor shrinkage - that lasted for more than three years			2
' this is the first cancer study to harness this drug - food interaction , ' the authors noted .			1

@entity21 stops an enzyme from breaking drug down so more enters the *bloodstream*
study is first to harness this usually dangerous drug interaction with grapefruit
could reduce side - effects as less medication needed
