the fight to clinch a third world title shot for @entity2 will be as expensive as the one which just saw him claim the @entity7 super-middleweight title was unexpectedly arduous			1
it will begin this bright monday morning			0
@entity9 , the @entity11 ’s @entity10 promoter , will call @entity13 headquarters in @entity14 to press the claim for @entity2 ’s mandatory challenge to @entity17 to take precedence over a voluntary defence			1
@entity2 lands a strong right fist on opponent @entity21 @entity2 ' promoter hopes to persuade @entity17 to open up a world title fight but @entity17 ( right ) , taking on @entity24 here , will take some convincing to take the fight that decision is likely to rest with @entity17 and @entity9 knows he will have to make the @entity32 ‘ an offer to come to @entity30 which is too good for him to refuse ’			1
he adds : ‘ it will be about the cash and fortunately we have the resources to deal with that			0
’ having invested heavily in saturday night ’s promotion at @entity39 — even to the extent of flying in mc @entity41 from the @entity32 to make his rumbling announcement of the main event — @entity9 is prepared to dig deep again in the interests of a @entity30 he proclaims as ‘ one of the most exciting young boxers in the world ’			2
still , it is by no means certain that @entity17 will take the bait			2
he has made it clear that he considers @entity2 to be unworthy of another chance so quickly after being stopped twice by @entity56 world champion @entity55			1
@entity17 goes so far as to suggest that the @entity11 should prove himself by giving @entity59 rival @entity57 a rematch			0
@entity2 launches a ferocious attack on @entity21 @entity21 protects himself from a @entity2 left hook @entity2 celebrates his belts with @entity65 stars @entity66 ( left ) and @entity67 in monetary terms , @entity17 ’s position is not as simple as the @entity2 camp would wish			1
a long - term strategy of a reasonable pay - night against a handpicked opponent he can be sure of beating , followed by a big bucks trip to @entity76 , would put even more cash in his bank account			2
since @entity2 is determined to keep busier now , that scenario would require him to find an interim opponent in the new year			2
it is important that he should get back into the ring by then , now that he has dealt with the stress of returning from his shattering ko by @entity55 on that may night at @entity85			0
it is never easy to come back from such a loss and @entity2 admitted he was ‘ tense ’ going into the ring to face @entity21 , adding : ‘ you can never be sure what will happen in the first fight back after a defeat but my confidence is still there and i felt good			1
’ he was impressive in the first half of the fight , starting at a furious pace in an attempt to secure an early stoppage and winning the first seven rounds on my card			0
but when the knockout failed to materialise , there were tell - tale signs of him fading again and the obdurate @entity21 enjoyed some success in the closing stages			0
@entity2 was twice stopped by @entity59 rival @entity55 @entity55 is adamant @entity2 would lose to @entity17 if the pair entered the ring @entity2 in training for his bout with @entity21 the decision was comfortably unanimous — with @entity21 agreeing he was well beaten on points — but not as emphatic as @entity2 would have liked against a second - tier super-middleweight			1
the only rematch which interests him is a third rubber with @entity55			0
the @entity117 , a ringside commentator , discounted that possibility and advised @entity2 to take another rebuilding fight rather than rush in against @entity17			2
@entity55 — still considering his own future — added : ‘ @entity2 still looks easy to hit at the moment			1
he might have been in some trouble against a heavier puncher than @entity21			0
@entity17 would grind him down over the 12 - round stretch			0
’ that is a niggling worry but @entity2 says : ‘ the plan is to get @entity17 over here early next year and win my world title			1
’ @entity11 is back , as brash as ever — which is good for @entity59 boxing — but as he concedes : ‘ there is still a long road to go			0

@entity2 beat @entity21 to claim the @entity7 title
he is now the mandatory challenger to world champion @entity17
wants to bring @entity17 to @entity76 but concedes there is a long way to go
the @entity32 thinks @entity2 is an *unsuitable* opponent
and @entity55 thinks @entity17 would win because @entity2 is ' easy to hit '
