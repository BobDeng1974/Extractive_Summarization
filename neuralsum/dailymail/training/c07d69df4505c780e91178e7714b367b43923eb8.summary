the longest - serving @entity1 spacecraft is beginning a plunge into the atmosphere of the solar system ’s hottest planet on wednesday , after a hugely successful eight - year mission			1
@entity8 ’s @entity7 has far outperformed expectations , with initial estimates for the mission expecting it to last not even two years at 500 days			1
but now , as the spacecraft runs out of fuel the mission is finally being brought to a close in the most dramatic of fashions - by sending it into the atmosphere of one of the most volatile planets we know			1
on wednesday , @entity8 's hugely successful @entity7 spacecraft will begin lower and lower forays into the harsh @entity1 atmosphere ( illustration shown )			1
the series of aerobraking maneuvers will see the spacecraft lowered to an altitude of just 80 miles ( 130 kilometres ) above the surface - but it 's unknown if it will survive @entity7 was launched back on 9 november 2005 and arrived at @entity1 on 11 april 2006			1
@entity1 is slightly smaller than @entity32 but has a similar mass. it is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles ( 108 million kilometres )			0
one day on @entity1 lasts as long as 243 @entity32 days			0
its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen , with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets			0
it 's believed that its atmosphere contributed to a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet inhospitable			0
the planet 's extreme high temperatures of almost 480 ° @entity49 ) make it seem an unlikely place for for life as we know it			0
it has since been orbiting @entity1 in an elliptical 24 - hour loop that begins a distant 40,000 miles ( 66,000 km ) over the south pole , affording incredible global views			0
its orbit then takes it to an altitude of around 155 miles ( 250 km ) above the surface at the north pole , close to the top of the planet ’s atmosphere			2
each orbit , however , required more and more fuel to be spent as the spacecraft battled against radiation exerted from the sun to maintain its speed			2
now the fuel supplies necessary to maintain the orbit are running low , reports @entity74			2
in may , routine science operations of the spacecraft ceased , with efforts shifted to making lower passes through the atmosphere			2
from 18 june until 11 july so - called ‘ experimental aerobraking ’ will take place , with the spacecraft ’s altitude gradually lowered			2
' we have performed previous short " aerodrag " campaigns where we ’ve skimmed the thin upper layers of the atmosphere at about 165 kilometres [ 100 miles ] , but we want to go deeper , perhaps as deep as 130 kilometres [ 80 miles ] , maybe even lower , ' says @entity88 , @entity7 mission manager it is not known , however , if the spacecraft will survive these risky operations - the fuel may or may not run out , while the electrical components may not handle the strain			1
whatever the outcome , the endeavour will provide some invaluable science about the composition of the @entity1 atmosphere			0
shown here is the minimum altitude the spacecraft is expected to reach			0
the spacecraft has been in orbit around @entity1 for eight years but , as it is running out of fuel , a decision was made to send it on a risky but potentially science rich mission deep into the atmosphere of @entity1 it will also prove a useful experiment into the limits of aerobraking			1
@entity7 is not the first spacecraft to journey this far into the @entity1 atmosphere			1
that honour is bestowed to a series of @entity121 spacecraft in the 1960s , 70s and 80s called the @entity124 probes			0
about a dozen were sent on daring missions to the surface of @entity1 , with only a handful being successful			0
the intense heat and atmospheric pressure crushed each of the probes in up to about an hour once they had penetrated the atmosphere - but a few managed to survive long enough to return data and images			0
the @entity124 probes were succeeded by the @entity137 spacecraft , high - altitude balloons that were sent into the atmosphere of @entity1 on scientific missions			1
@entity141 can be used as a way of getting into orbit around planets without having to carry quite so much fuel , thus reducing the launch mass. but spacecraft are typically not subjected to intense aerobraking , instead only ‘ brushing ’ the atmosphere of a planet			1
if @entity7 survives this mission , it could allow for more extreme aerobraking manoeuvres in future - allowing for spacecraft to carry more advanced instruments at the expense of additional fuel is not needed			1
but if the spacecraft is still healthy afterwards , its orbit will be raised again to an altitude of 300 miles ( 475 kilometres ) in @entity161			0
limited operations will continue for several more months but , by the end of the year at the latest , the fuel will have been exhausted			0
this will mean that as 2014 draws to a close , the decay of the spacecraft ’s orbit will continue until it deteoriates completely ; there is no chance of it surviving into 2015 , according to @entity8			1
in its time orbiting @entity1 , @entity8 's spacecraft has returned huge amounts of scientific data			1
this included observational evidence for past and present volcanoes on the surface , possibly accounting for the runaway greenhouse effect that gave the planet its thick atmosphere and scorching temperature in its eight years it has found volcanoes on @entity1 , tracked extreme weather , seen evidence of extraterrestrial lightning and much more			1
with a suite of seven instruments , the spacecraft has provided a comprehensive study of the ionosphere , atmosphere and surface of @entity1			2
' @entity7 has taught us just how variable the planet is on all timescales and , furthermore , has given us clues as to how it might have changed since its formation 4.6 billion years ago , ' says @entity200 , @entity8 ’s project scientist			2
and there could be more surprises in store yet , if its communication equipment survives the foray through the atmosphere and is able to send data back to @entity32 .			0

@entity8 , *headquartered* in @entity209 , is beginning the *descent* of its @entity1 probe
the @entity7 craft will begin reducing its altitude on wednesday
until *mid-july* it will orbit lower and lower into the thick atmosphere
it will likely be the spacecraft 's last mission as it is running out of fuel
the hugely successful @entity7 probe entered orbit on 11 april 2006
