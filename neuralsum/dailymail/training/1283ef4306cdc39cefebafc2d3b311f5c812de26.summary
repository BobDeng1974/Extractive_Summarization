by @entity0 a woman escaped an explosion after an e-cigarette plugged into a faulty charger set her family home on fire			1
the woman was alerted to the blaze in an upstairs bedroom of the house in @entity11 , @entity12 , by her smoke alarm - which had only had its battery changed the previous week			1
she managed to escape downstairs before the explosion , caused by the heating of a pressurised canister of an air horn that was in the room			2
@entity40 , group manager from the service , said : ‘ we discovered that the woman ’s son had lost the charger that came with the e-cigarette kit he had bought , so he had plugged it into a different usb charger and then gone out			1
‘ this then overheated and caught light to the bedding , and the fire then caused the canister to expand and explode			2
’ he added : ‘ plugs need to be appropriate for the device they are charging and not all can be transferred between devices			0
‘ the consequences of using the wrong charger with the wrong device can be devastating and we are extremely relieved that on this occasion no - one was harmed			0
’ it is the latest in a string of incidents in the @entity32 involving the use of cheap or inappropriate chargers			1
in may , a @entity67 woman was burned after her e-cigarette exploded when it was plugged into her phone charger and a barmaid in @entity71 was also injured earlier this year when a charging e-cigarette overheated			1
while e-cigarettes can be susceptible to overheating due to the type of battery they contain , @entity12 ’s @entity72 have stressed the importance of using the right charger for all devices and raise awareness of the dangers of cheap alternatives			1
a spokesman from @entity84 said : ‘ the message is do not buy cheap or unbranded chargers for use with e-cigarettes , mobile phones or any other devices			1
they are invariably dangerous and illegal			0
‘ at the least , they are capable of destroying your device			0
at worst , they have the potential to give a fatal electric shock or cause a very serious house fire			0
‘ our officers regularly stop and destroy large quantities of unsafe chargers as part of their work at ports			0
this is a widespread problem , with many being sold through internet sellers			0
‘ always make sure that the rated output of your charger is matched to the product you are charging			2
’ electronic cigarettes are said to be ' susceptible to overheating due to the type of battery they contain '			0
