questions have been raised over the delay in the arrival of an ambulance to treat critically injured batsman @entity4 at the @entity5			1
a day after the 25 - year - old was struck by a bouncer bowled by @entity10 ' @entity9 , there have been conflicting reports about when an ambulance was called and when one arrived on tuesday			1
@entity5 officials confirmed on wednesday they had called for an ambulance about six minutes after @entity4 collapsed face first on the pitch , not 14 minutes as initially reported earlier on the same day			1
that it took 23 minutes to arrive at the ground has raised serious concerns about the responsiveness of the @entity24 service , prompting state health minister @entity25 to demand an explanation from the ambulance commissioner , @entity5 's @entity18 reports			1
warning : some pictures and video in this story may be distressing @entity32 was critically injured during @entity34 's match against @entity10 at @entity5 the batsman was struck in the head by a bouncer from @entity9 , which led to a brain haemorrhage @entity41 coach @entity40 ( right ) and @entity42 leave @entity43 after visiting @entity4 @entity44 and @entity45 arrive and embrace outside the @entity5 hospital before spending time with @entity4 visitors were seen coming in and out of the hospital throughout tuesday and wednesday former @entity41 cricketer @entity49 leaves @entity51 's hospital after visiting former team - mate @entity4 @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 leave @entity51 's hospital on wednesday afternoon @entity56 and wife @entity57 also visited @entity4 , where his family is maintaining a bedside vigil cricketers @entity63 ( left ) and his wife @entity64 ( right ) arrive with @entity41 batsman @entity42 ( centre ) horrified onlookers , including @entity4 ' mother and sister , at @entity5 witnessed @entity4 felling to the ground at 2.23pm on tuesday as players rushed to his side to help him out			1
in photographs , they are seen gesturing to officials , asking them to phone emergency services			0
2.23pm : @entity4 is hit by a bouncer bowled by @entity9 and falls to the ground 2.29pm : @entity5 staff raise the alarm and phone triple - 0 for an ambulance 2.37pm : another call is made to @entity24 2.44pm : an ambulance that responded to the second call for help arrives at @entity5 2.52pm : the ambulance responding to the first call made 23 minutes ago finally arrives at the scene on wednesday morning , @entity24 said it did not receive a triple - 0 call until 2.37pm , but later clarified the first call was made by ground staff at 2.29pm			1
the confusion appears to have come about because the ambulance that responded to the 2.37pm call arrived first at the @entity5 at 2.44pm			1
the ambulance called out at 2.29pm did not arrive until 2.52pm , @entity24 said			1
' a doctor provided treatment to the patient until paramedics arrived and assisted in stabilising him , ' @entity24 chief executive commissioner @entity94 said in a statement			1
a helicopter , with a specialist doctor and paramedic on board , as well as another road ambulance were also dispatched			2
@entity43 was identified as the closest hospital , and road the fastest and safest route			0
cardiologist dr @entity109 said he had ' no idea whatsoever ' why it took six minutes for the first triple - 0 call to be made			1
' you could see he staggered for a few seconds then went flat down , completely unconscious - that should have prompted a call to the ambulance immediately , ' dr @entity109 told @entity118			1
' one of the things we say in medicine is that " time is tissue " and the longer you wait to treat any acute injury or acute problem , the more tissue is damaged			0
' and that 's clearly the case here , because there was a time delay he 's had now very severe brain injuries			0
' but dr @entity109 said @entity4 might have sustained the same injuries regardless of response time			2
' because by the look of it he was cracked in the back of the skull over a place called the cerebellum , which is very close to the brain stem , and the brain stems a really important place for vital things like breathing and consciousness , ' he said			0
' and so if you get swelling into that area straight away and you rupture an artery and bleed into the area the brain stem can actually be compressed down through what we can the foramen magnum into the spinal cord which is where all this sort of stuff happens			0
' dr @entity109 added that he believed the ambulance took so long to arrive because ambulance services are overstretched			0
@entity162 and @entity163 defended its handling of the incident			0
' @entity5 staff followed the venue 's emergency management plan quickly , calmly and professionally , as did staff from @entity171 and the @entity172 , ' communications director @entity166 said			2
@entity4 , 25 , remains in a critical condition at @entity43 at @entity174 - in @entity5 's inner - city @entity4 was put in an induced coma at @entity5 's @entity43 but tragically died on thursday			1
@entity178 neurosurgeon dr @entity177 told @entity5 's @entity18 time was of the essence when it came to injuries of all kinds but it was even more integral when it came to swelling on the brain			2
she said the best thing for that was for paramedics to get the patient to the hospital as soon as possible			0
' if there is a blood clot that has been created by an injury it will cause significant pressure on the brain , which is what causes death and injury , ' dr @entity177 said			0
' unless that is relieved quickly your chances of recovery are slim			0
' health minister @entity25 will meet with the ambulance commissioner on thursday over the delays			1
' due to the conflicting information distributed today [ wednesday ] by @entity24 regarding yesterday 's [ tuesday 's ] response to the @entity5 , i will be meeting with @entity24 commissioner @entity94 tomorrow [ thursday ] to discuss the circumstances surrounding the incident , ' she said			1
doctors say the minutes after he was hit with a cricket ball were crucial as paramedics need to get patients to a hospital as soon as possible if they have a brain injury ' my thoughts remain with @entity32 and his family , who i know are receiving the very best care at @entity43			0
' this came as friends and family were seen flooding into the hospital where @entity4 was staying on wednesday while his relatives maintained a bedside vigil , awaiting any changes in his condition			2
on wednesday , relatives including his brother @entity231 who introduced him to the sport , were joined at @entity4 ' bedside by close friend and @entity34 â€™s team captain @entity235			2
the national skipper returned to the hospital about 7am on wednesday morning after spending seven hours supporting @entity4 in the intensive care unit on tuesday night			2
@entity235 left the hospital at 10.20am and appeared downcast as he walked to the carpark with sunglasses on and his hands in his pockets			0
he drove away in a white @entity245 sedan			0
fellow teammate @entity44 spent 40 minutes with the fallen batsman , coming out visibly distressed			0

initially the @entity24 said it did not receive a call until 14 minutes after @entity4 collapsed at the @entity5
it was later clarified it had received a triple - 0 call at 2.29pm not 2.37pm
confusion appears to have come about because the ambulance that responded to the 2.37pm call arrived first
the one called for at 2.29pm did not show up until 23 minutes later
@entity10 's health minister will meet with the ambulance commissioner on thursday over the delays
