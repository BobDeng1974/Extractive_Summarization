a high court judge today ruled that a little boy with brain damage should be taken off a life - support machine despite his parents ' pleas to keep him alive			1

however , the boy 's devout @entity15 parents - who can not be identified for legal reasons - disagreed			1
today the youngster 's father said no - one had the right to take away the ' privilege ' of life from his son			1
in words that echoed those of the parents of five - year - old cancer victim @entity30 , whose family fled the @entity32 after disagreements with the @entity34 over his treatment , the baby ’s father had said they had been made to feel ‘ our child is not our child anymore ’ by doctors who gave ‘ no consideration ’ to their feelings			1
a mother told the @entity44 ( pictured ) that ‘ miracles do happen ’ as she pleaded for the life of her son ms @entity7 analysed the one - year - old boy 's case at a hearing in the @entity44 of the @entity44 in @entity51 today - after an application by the @entity34 foundation trust which runs the hospital where the youngster is being cared for			1
the judge gave the trust permission to withdraw life - sustaining ventilation - and said she had reached the decision ' very sadly ' and with ' great reluctance '			1
ms @entity7 today thanked the parents for speaking to her and for the ' dignified ' way they had conducted themselves			2
' this case is unbearably sad , ' she said			2
' the parents do n't agree to the withdrawal of ventilation			2
they love their son and believe that he responds to them			0
' as committed and devout @entity15 they do n't feel they have the right to agree to life - sustaining treatment being withdrawn			1
' it is their belief that given time @entity75 may work a miracle			1
i have nothing but sympathy for them and admire the love and devotion they have shown			0
' the parents believe in the possibility of recovery			2
that is not the opinion of the medical experts			0

the restriction relating to the naming of the trust would remain in force as long as the boy was alive			0
lawyer @entity106 , representing the trust , told ms justice @entity7 that the boy was born prematurely by emergency caesarean section in ' poor condition ' and he required resuscitation and ventilation at birth			0
ms @entity106 said in late 2013 he had suffered an ' acute cardio - respiratory deterioration ' , which required him to be ' mechanically ventilated once again '			0
she said he was ' ventilator dependent ' and his condition had not improved despite ' on - going intensive care '			2
doctors had concluded that there was no prospect of recovery			0
however , ms justice @entity120 also said there had been ' multiple failures in the multi-disciplinary team caring for him ' and the boy went into a period of cardiac arrest lasting about 20 minutes			0
the case echoes that of five - year - old cancer victim @entity30 ( pictured ) , whose family fled the @entity32 after disagreements with the @entity34 over his treatment ms @entity106 told the court that an investigation was carried out and said the ' trust have endeavored to be entirely transparent about what has gone wrong '			1

the boy 's mother told ms justice @entity7 : ' at the end of the day he is still alive			1
the ventilator is helping and supporting that life			0
where there is life , i do n't think you should get the right to determine whether that should be taken away			0
' she said she had seen her son 's eyes move and added : ' we believe that ( he ) does respond to us as parents			2
we do n't feel that the trust has the right to end his life because he has got brain damage			2
' the mother said she believed that her son might recover to the point where he could experience the ' pleasures of life '			0
' he is still alive , ' she told the judge			0
' the boy 's father told the judge that no one knew a child better than their mother and father			1
he said : ' even though he is going through all these problems , he still knows ... what is going on			0
i spend a lot of time with him , talking to him			0
i know when he is listening ... we know he is reacting to certain things			0
' he still has life			0
we do n't have the right , as parents , as individuals , to take this privilege from him			2
