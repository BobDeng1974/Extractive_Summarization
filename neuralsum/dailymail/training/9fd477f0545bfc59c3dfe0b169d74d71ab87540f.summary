removing @entity17 on earth is a very tiny work for our group which is a worldwide organization			1
and what we have done so far is only a small part of our further @entity61 's your false if you if you think this crisis will be over after some time			2

bad news : more bad news in the @entity1 hack as it has been reported that 47,000 social security numbers for past and current employees were leaked , including actress @entity94 victims : among those who had their information taken were @entity98 ( left ) and @entity99 ( right ) ' nobody can prevent us , but the only way is to follow our demand			1
if you want to prevent us , make your company behave wisely			0
' it comes after the details of @entity1 employees including director @entity98 and actors @entity94 and @entity99 were leaked from the firm 's system			1
the leaked numbers belong to both past and current employees of the studio juggernaut			1
the studio had no comment on this most recent leak according to the @entity118			0
it came shortly after it was revealed that financial records had became public that detailed how much stars like @entity123 and @entity124 were making , as well as studio heads @entity126 and @entity127			1
the hackers also uploaded five yet - to - be - released films to file - sharing websites , including the @entity132 film @entity133 , still in theaters , and @entity135 , the much - anticipated remake set for a december 19 release			1
millionaires : @entity17 co-chairman @entity127 ( left ) and @entity17 ceo @entity126 ( right ) both make $ 3million a year , according to the leaked documents the company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease - and - desist orders			2
pay information for more than 31,000 employees at @entity146 , a financial firm hired by @entity1 , were taken in the hack as well			1
the pay information from 2005 revealed that there are far more men than women with high - paying salaries			1
the list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site fusion			2
@entity157 , reporting for @entity158 , who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source , said : ' when i sorted the list by ' annual rate , ' i noticed something notable : a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most			0
' based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of @entity17 with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men			0
' @entity173 reviewed almost @entity174 of leaked internal data and reported it included ' employee criminal background checks , salary negotiations , and doctors ' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence			2
' it reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by breaking @entity189 creator @entity188 as well as ' email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing , while one disciplinary letter details a manager 's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate			1
' the leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive			1
one aspect of the leak , which probably has the @entity1 it team reeling , is the several spreadsheet and text documents where employees stored their passwords ... under the name ' password '			1
the hack is thought to be carried out by those allied with the @entity31 regime , unhappy with the country 's portrayal in the film			1
in june , a @entity31 official appeared on the state - run news station to say the country would pursue ' a strong and merciless countermeasure ' if @entity1 released the film			1
despite the threat , @entity1 has continued to roll out promotion for the movie ahead of it 's december 25 release date			1
paydays : @entity123 took home $ 8.4million working on @entity33 , compared to the $ 6.5million his co-star @entity124 made ( left ) , according to information revealed in the recent cyber attack on @entity1 responsible ? sources close to the internal investigation of the hack at @entity1 say they believe a @entity31 group is behind the attack			1
officials in @entity31 previously threatened action exactly one month before it was set to be released , @entity1 confirmed that the company had been hacked , and that the mysterious group behind the cyber attack released hundreds of company documents online			1
the day before , an alleged warning posted to @entity242 read : ' this is just the beginning '			0
@entity1 has yet to officially name @entity31 as the source of the cyber attack , but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out on wednesday to say they believe a group known as @entity247 is to blame			1
the group associated with @entity31 was thought to be behind the large - scale march 2013 attack on @entity251 banks and broadcasters			1
other evidence from the hack points to the regime , including @entity31 - language coding , in similarities to other attacks by @entity247			1
the results of the internal investigation into the attack , currently being carried out by @entity264 's @entity263 forensics unit , are expected to be announced later this week			0
earlier this week , a @entity31 spokesperson refused to deny claims that it was behind the move and would only say ' wait and see ' when asked if @entity269 was involved			1
