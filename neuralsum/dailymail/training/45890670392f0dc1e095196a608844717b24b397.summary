by @entity0 for @entity1 an incredibly rare sighting has been captured by @entity4 scientists of a rare @entity6 dolphin species			1
the elusive aquatic animal shows some rather unusual behaviour is known for by beaching itself in order to feed			1
a pod of @entity6 humpback dolphins was spotted by the scientists in the @entity15 estuary of @entity16			1
‘ we soon realised we were witnessing an incredible event , ’ she said			0
‘ the humpback dolphins were observed swimming a few metres away from the shoreline			0
’ this behaviour allows dolphins to concentrate fish against the mud bank before charging at them at high speed			2
on some occasions the fish were washed onto the shoreline by the wave of water associated with the dolphin 's beaching , resulting in a full body exposed beaching			2
while other times it was only partially beached with more than half of their body exposed			0
‘ in these shallow waters the agility of the dolphin ’s neck region enabled them to reach for the stranded fish before sliding back into the deeper water , thanks to the soft mud			2
’ three years ago , the research team spotted a similar occurrence at the @entity15			2
the rare @entity6 humpback dolphin 's fin breaks the water in the riverlands of the @entity15 the dolphins show ' herd ' the fish they are hunting towards the shoreline then force them out of the water where they slide out of the water then eat their prey they saw an animal which appeared to be stranded and dead on a mud bank however upon a closer look they realised the animal was alive as it slid back into the water			1
the @entity15 ’s network of narrow deep creeks and channels with steep muddy edges provides the perfect habitat for the display of this behaviour			0
prior to this , the only other written report of beach hunting behaviour in @entity6 humpback dolphins was in 2007 near @entity93 in the @entity94			1
dr @entity21 and her team ’s discovery shows that hunting and foraging techniques have advanced from just hunting in the comforts of the water but are able to corner their prey out of the water			0
the behaviour also shows evidence of social learning or even a learning culture			0
until now , the rare ‘ beach hunting ’ behaviour has been documented in only two species : the @entity110 in @entity111 ; and bottlenose dolphins in @entity113 and @entity114 in the @entity115 , @entity116 in @entity117 , and @entity118 and @entity119 in @entity120			1
the research team will keep collecting information to better understand the factors promoting this behaviour .			0

a rare @entity6 dolphin species which sometimes beaches has been spotted for the second time in three years
@entity4 scientists recorded the unusual behaviour of the species that is near - *threatened*
the species is known for beaching themselves in order to feed
