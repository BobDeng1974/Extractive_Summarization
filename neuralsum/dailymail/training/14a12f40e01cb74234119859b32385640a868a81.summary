by @entity1 reporter published : 12:50 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 13:30 est , 29 november 2013 violent @entity4 drug cartels have muscled in to the country 's lucrative mining industry during a mafia - style takeover of great swathes of the economy , officials warned			1
the criminal gangs looking to diversify their businesses long ago moved into oil theft , pirated goods , extortion and kidnapping , consuming an ever larger swath of the country 's economy			1
but the true extent of their penetration into @entity4 's massive mining and iron ore exporting industry , which feeds many @entity26 mills , has now been revealed			1
pressure : the @entity4 authorities have been under intense pressure to crack down on the drug cartels operating in the country			1
( @entity32 picture ) such large - scale illegal mining operations were long thought to be wild rumor , but federal officials confirmed they had known about the cartels ' involvement in mining since 2010			1
they also revealed that the military takeover of @entity41 , @entity4 's second - largest port , in november , this year , was aimed at cutting off the cartels ' export trade			1
that news served as a wake - up call to @entity4 that drug traffickers have penetrated the country 's economy at unheard - of levels , becoming true @entity52 - style organizations , ready to defend their mines at gun point			1
three @entity56 state detectives were wounded in an ambush earlier this week when they were traveling to investigate a mine taken over by criminals			0
when reinforcements arrived , those officers were also ambushed , part of a string of attacks on police in @entity56 on wednesday and thursday that left two officers dead and about a dozen wounded			0
@entity68 : @entity4 authorities have been waging a bloody war against the drug cartels for decades the @entity73 cartel and its predecessor , the @entity76 drug gang , have been stealing or extorting shipments of iron ore , or illegally extracting the mineral themselves and selling it through @entity82 coast ports , said @entity56 residents , mining companies and current and former federal officials			1
the cartel had already imposed demands for ' protection payments ' on many in the state , including shopkeepers , ranchers and farmers			1
but so deeply entrenched was the cartel connection to mines , mills , ports , export firms and land holders that it took authorities three years to confront the phenomenon head - on			0
federal officials said they are looking to crack down on other ports where drug gangs are operating			1
' this is the terrible thing about this process of ( the cartel 's ) taking control of and reconfiguring the state , ' said @entity111 , the former head of the country 's top domestic intelligence agency			2
' they managed to impose a @entity52 - style control of organized crime , and the different social groups like port authorities , transnational companies and local landowners , had to get in line			1
' new tricks : drug cartels are diversifying their business , away from narcotics , a tonnes of which are burnt by authorities after being seized in this image , to illegal mining , oil theft , pirated goods , extortion and kidnapping			1
( @entity32 picture ) @entity135 said that even back in 2010 , the @entity76 cartel would take ore from areas that were under concession to private mining companies , sometimes with the aid or complicity of local farmers and land owners , then sell the ore to processors , distributors and even , apparently , foreign firms			1
@entity4 's @entity149 said the problem was so severe that it prompted the government to quietly toughen rules on exporters in 2011 and 2012 and make them prove they received their ore from established , recognized sources			1
in 2012 , the department denied export applications from 13 companies , because they did n't meet the new rules			0
and the problem was n't just limited to @entity56 , or the @entity73 cartel			0
' since 2010 , evidence surfaced of irregular mining of iron in the states of @entity170 , @entity56 and @entity171 , ' the department said in a statement to @entity173			1
' that illegal activity was encouraged by the great demand for iron by countries such as @entity26 , to develop their industries , ' according to the department			0
' many trading companies began to build up big stockpiles of legally and illegally obtained iron ( ore ) , that was later shipped out for export			0
' profits : the @entity4 cartels , which have built up a massive arsenal of weaponry are making huge profits by moving away from drugs and into other lucrative operations , including kidnapping , mining and extortion a @entity4 federal official , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the cartels would use a combination of threats and outright theft to get the ore from mines			1
he said the nexus between the cartels and export companies was key			2
' they extort the merchandise from mining companies and then export it through legal companies , or they rob trucks full ( of ore ) that later turn up in a legal manner , ' the official said			2
@entity215 , a resident of the @entity56 mining village of @entity217 , said that since 2012 , the @entity73 cartel has demanded residents hand over part of the royalty payments from a local iron ore mine operated by @entity223 , a @entity224 - based consortium			2
@entity215 , a member of a self - defense group that rose up in arms in @entity217 this summer to kick the cartel out , said the cartel also had been hiring people to extract the ore without permits , and then exporting it through another @entity82 coast port , @entity232			2
' they were n't content with getting our money and robbing our trucks , so they began secretly extracting our minerals , ' said @entity215			0
under attack : bullet holes are seen over a police vehicle and a police station wall after an attack by members of a local drug cartel - one of many which is seizing control of swathes of the economy			1
( @entity32 picture ) @entity223 said in a statement that it has received reports of irregular mining near its operations in @entity217			0
' those have been passed on to the appropriate authorities , ' the company said in a statement			0
government figures show the amount of iron ore being exported to @entity26 quadrupled between 2008 and the first half of 2013 , rising to 4.6 million tons per year , precisely during the period the @entity76 cartel and later the @entity73 cemented their control over @entity56			0
in 2008 , @entity41 handled only 1.5 percent of @entity4 's iron ore exports to @entity26 ; by mid- 2013 , the seaport was shipping out nearly half			1
in 2010 , the attorney general 's office estimated the cartels shipped 1.1 million tons of illegally extracted iron ore abroad that year			2
officials said the export scheme may have involved other sea ports , and that more military takeovers may be necessary			2
the cartel mining issue also resurfaced last year in the coal - mining state of @entity276 bordering @entity277			0
the former governor , @entity278 , called a press conference to claim that @entity280 , leader of the @entity282 cartel , was running illegal coal mining ventures and partnering with legitimate ones			0
so far , none of the accusations have been proven			0
the only known arrests related to cartel mining operations occurred in @entity56 in 2010 , when @entity290 , an alleged member of @entity76 , was accused of selling ore illegally to @entity26 , the federal attorney general 's office said at the time			2
but the arrest apparently came to little ; the attorney general 's office could not say whether @entity290 had been tried or convicted of that crime , nor could the @entity173 determine if he is represented by a lawyer or is still in custody			0
the @entity26 @entity297 did not immediately respond to requests for information on companies that have been involved in buying ore from cartels , knowingly or otherwise			0
the @entity302 declined to comment on whether @entity26 had any measures in place to ensure the legal provenance of such imports			0
the iron ore , meanwhile , has both swelled the cartels ' bankrolls , giving them more money to buy guns and bribe officials , and fed the hunger of @entity316 steel mills			2
and it may be a two - way trade : precursor chemicals the cartel uses to make methamphetamines often arrive from @entity26 at both the @entity41 and @entity232 ports .			0
