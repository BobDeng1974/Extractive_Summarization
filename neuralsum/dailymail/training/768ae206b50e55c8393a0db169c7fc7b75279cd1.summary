@entity0 felt the @entity2 game would be the biggest of @entity3 ’s week			1
after an extraordinary night in @entity5 on tuesday , it has now become bigger than even he could have imagined			2
i was in @entity5 as a fan			2
these occasions sum up what @entity3 are about : the @entity11 , a capacity crowd in a magnificent stadium , supporters travelling in vast numbers , dreaming they will be able to say in years to come : ‘ i was there the night we beat @entity5			1
’ it turned out to be a game that will live in the memory but not for the reasons anyone hoped would be the case			2
the team sheet that @entity0 handed in before kick - off — and the relentless debate that followed — has seen to that			1
some of his decisions i did n’t agree with , others i could completely understand			1
this is how i saw it			2
when we got into the @entity31 before kick - off , the full extent of how much @entity0 had altered his team had circulated and it left many high up in the away section , who already viewed the fixture with trepidation , fearing a night even more painful than the one @entity5 inflicted at @entity54			1
so then i began to study the team sheet			2
@entity56 instead of @entity57 ? i could understand that			2
@entity56 has been @entity3 ’s best right back this season			1
@entity61 for @entity62 ? again , no problem			2
@entity62 ’s erratic form meant he did n’t deserve to be picked			2
@entity65 for @entity66 ? no issue there			2
@entity65 covered more ground in one game than @entity66 had done in 10			0
the absence of @entity72 did n’t bother me , either , as he ca n’t be trusted to deliver in big away games			0
those players who came in all deserve to start against @entity2			0
@entity61 ( left ) had one of his best games in a @entity3 shirt , frequently frustrating @entity5 's stars the ever - willing @entity65 ( centre ) put in more effort than the mercurial @entity66 @entity0 , remember , was n’t ripping up a team that had won six straight matches			1
nobody knows what @entity3 ’s best xi is at present , not even the manager			1
and if we think the best he had were on show when @entity5 came to @entity54 , being on the end of a 3 - 0 battering weakens those claims			0
what ’s more , @entity3 were never going to attack @entity5 , so the changes did n’t alter tactics			1
anyone who believes @entity3 , under @entity97 and @entity98 , took on top teams away in @entity101 are living in a dream world			1
neither did the all - conquering sides in the 1970s and 1980s			0
yet what i could n’t fathom were the omissions of @entity108 ( @entity0 ’s captain ) , @entity110 ( his vice-captain ) and the best attacker , @entity112			1
those three , along with @entity113 and @entity114 , were the reason they came so close to winning the title and returned to @entity101 ’s elite			0
after their efforts last season , they deserved to start in the @entity31			1
the reason players love the @entity11 so much is the thought of playing in an arena such as the @entity31			1
what are the chances of @entity128 playing there again ? will @entity110 and @entity112 ever have the opportunity in the future ? you believe that you will get plenty of chances but i played for @entity3 for 17 years and a trip to the @entity31 only came around once			1
@entity137 ( right ) stifles @entity138 with @entity140 's help during @entity3 's 1 - 0 win in @entity5 in 2009 @entity108 ( left ) watches from the bench , alongside @entity57 and @entity110 i felt those three deserved to be in the team and it had nothing to do with sentiment			1
they deserved to play because they are part of @entity3 ’s best team			1
i can imagine how they would have felt when @entity0 told them they were out			1
they would have been professional but they would have been devastated			0
when you grow up , you dream about playing against @entity5 in the @entity31			1
during my career , i won several big trophies but , believe me , nights in the @entity158 , the @entity159 and the @entity31 , three of football ’s cathedrals , are up there in my memories ; victories against @entity167 ( february 2007 ) , @entity165 ( march 2008 ) and @entity5 ( february 2009 ) were special			1
this squad had a similar opportunity			0
yes , @entity3 played reasonably well and showed more than they had for a number of weeks but relief that they did n’t suffer a heavy defeat is not what following @entity3 in @entity101 should be about			1
what confuses me is the importance the @entity2 game has been given			0
it is big , of course it is			0
but there are 28 matches to go			0
winning wo n’t guarantee @entity3 ’s place in the top four this season , in the same way a defeat wo n’t leave them with too much ground to make up			1
@entity108 ( left ) and @entity112 were introduced in the 69th minute			1
both should have started the game the travelling fans were in good voice as ever , but left the @entity31 with a narrow defeat it baffles me when teams are more interested in qualifying for the competition next season than doing their best in the competition they are already in			1
@entity2 is n’t make or break			0
had @entity201 — a side with no @entity203 commitments — been the visitors to @entity54 and @entity3 had played abroad on wednesday night , i could have seen why @entity0 wanted @entity108 , @entity110 and @entity112 refreshed , but not on this occasion			1
they are playing a @entity2 side who have been away in @entity101 and had 24 hours less to recover			0
@entity3 stayed in @entity5 after the game to train on wednesday , too , so the players have n’t had a disrupted night ’s sleep to contend with			1
the physical demands have n’t been so severe			0
this , however , is where we are			0
when you are involved with @entity3 , things can be moving along quietly when an issue explodes and takes over			1
this is one of those times			0
@entity2 were held by @entity220 in @entity221 and played a day after @entity3 in midweek when @entity223 makes an appearance at @entity54 , it is usually an eventful one @entity227 ’s @entity226 excuses just do n’t stack up @entity227 now need a miracle to reach the @entity11 knockout stages			1
we keep hearing how they are unlucky because they have been drawn in tough groups but that does not wash			0
@entity235 has enough quality at his disposal and should have got out of this group with @entity239			0
why are they behind @entity241 ? the @entity242 have improved in the past two seasons but their squad does not boast the depth of @entity227 ’s			0
why have they failed to beat @entity246 over two games ? last season , @entity227 did the double over @entity246 , who lost five out of six matches			2
@entity252 is in disbelief during @entity227 's costly @entity11 defeat to @entity246 @entity255 sums up the mood after @entity227 concede a second early goal to @entity258 in 2012			2
they drew 2 - 2 @entity259 leads the troops as they trudge off after @entity227 sank to a 1 - 0 defeat in @entity262 in 2012 this is n’t like how it was for @entity201 and @entity265 when they were new to the competition			2
in the 1990s , they had @entity269 squads who were not used to playing in @entity101 , and it took time to adjust			0
yes , @entity227 have had some tough draws against @entity262 , @entity5 and @entity239 but they were knocked out of a group by @entity273 and failed to beat @entity258 , home or away , in 2012 under @entity275			0
city have men who have played in @entity11 and @entity279 finals			0
they should be able to negotiate these tests			0
the excuses do n’t stack up			0
i said last week @entity227 ’s squad needs to be broken up			0
defeat by @entity246 provided confirmation			0
this week i 'm looking forward to ... seeing @entity285 continue to dazzle @entity286 have a rich history of building teams around influential central midfielders , headed by the ‘ @entity290 ’ of @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293			2
in the 1980s , the team i grew up watching was inspired by @entity295 and @entity296 , and it is looking more and more like @entity285 , the @entity297 international , is going to keep up past traditions			2
he has the potential to be one of the best in the @entity302			0
@entity285 was outstanding in thursday ’s 3 - 0 @entity304 triumph over @entity305 and he will have a key role again at the @entity307 , as @entity286 look to apply pressure to the teams near the top			2
@entity285 ( left ) was again impressive in midweek as @entity286 strolled past @entity305 in the @entity304 @entity295 ( right ) is challenged by @entity312 's @entity311 during 1985 's @entity313 semi-final @entity296 controls the ball during the 1989 @entity317 final , which @entity286 lost to @entity318 @entity3 wanted to sign him when he was 16 and the better he plays for @entity286 , the more it is looking like a mistake that we allowed him to slip through our fingers			1
he did n’t want to leave @entity323 at that age but @entity3 ’s loss has been @entity286 ’s gain			1
i am a big fan of @entity285 and i never fail to be impressed when i see him			0
i do feel he needs to add more goals to his game but , if he can do that , he will be the real deal			0
@entity286 have a top player on their hands .			0

@entity0 has been *widely* criticised for his team selection in the @entity31
i am not going to join the chorus of disapproval . some of his decisions i did **n't** agree with , others i could completely understand
nobody knows what @entity3 's best xi is at present , not even the manager
what i could **n't** fathom were the omissions of @entity108 , @entity110 and the best attacker , @entity112
it baffles me when teams are more interested in qualifying for the competition next season than doing their best in the competition they are already in
