by @entity0 and @entity1 there are few clubs in the @entity4 who want to see the back of this season more than @entity8			1
they have struggled for form since the turn of the year , their fans staged a protest walkout against owner @entity14 and manager @entity15 last week and the local paper is campaigning for the manager to be sacked			1
@entity18 would be an understatement for this club			0
@entity23 , needing a win to keep any faint title hopes alive , could not ask for better opponents at @entity25 on sunday			1
feeling the heat : @entity8 boss @entity15 is under pressure from the fans after his team 's poor season making their point : @entity8 fans display a banner in protest against @entity15 and owner @entity14 during last week 's 3 - 0 win over @entity37 not impressed : @entity8 fans let @entity14 and @entity15 exactly how they felt during last week 's win over @entity37 at @entity39 the verbal abuse was so strong during last week ’s 3 - 0 victory over @entity37 , which ended a run of six straight defeats , that @entity15 did not leave the home dug - out			1
two thousand fans , aggrieved by the lack of signings and bad results , walked out after 69 minutes , chosen because the last time the club won a trophy , the @entity51 , was in 1969			1
the contrast could not have been more stark this week as @entity14 marched in his sports direct staff for the company ’s annual conference of free beer and games			1
@entity8 will finish the season in the top 10 , with at least eight points more than last season , triggering a staff bonus and most likely keeping @entity15 in a job			1
@entity15 will meet the owner for talks next week but the club distanced themselves from reports on friday that they have made an approach for @entity70 manager @entity69 , with sources claiming the 47 - year - old @entity72 had been offered to them			1
asked if he expects to be @entity8 boss next season , @entity15 said : ‘ i hope so			1
there was a lot of frustration and i understand that			0
hopefully i can prove , as i ’ve done at previous clubs , that i can come back stronger			0
’ linked : @entity8 were reported to have made an approach for @entity70 boss @entity69 feeling the love : @entity15 did find some fans who were keen to have an autograph before the @entity37 match but the majority are not keen on him the fans want him out			1
@entity15 is said to be devastated at the abuse he faced last week and will no doubt have noted the front page of the powerful @entity90 on tuesday : ‘ @entity91 to @entity15 , go now ! @entity15 ’s case has n’t been helped by the lack of investment in his squad			1
@entity14 has not bought a player since january 2013 and the club ’s best performer , @entity97 , was sold to @entity99 in january			2
there have been problems among the players , too			0
after a 4 - 0 defeat by @entity105 last month , @entity103 was thrown out of the dressing room by a team - mate , and @entity108 and @entity109 have not started a game this year			2
going back home : @entity72 @entity97 joined @entity99 in january from @entity8 troubled campaign : @entity8 winger @entity103 has endured a poor season out of favour : @entity109 , left , and @entity115 have not started a game for @entity8 this year the three , who cost in excess of £ 10million , are unlikely to play again for the club			1
those who have played have been poor			0
only four teams have conceded more than @entity8 ’s 57 goals and no team have won fewer points after going behind than their three			1
‘ in the second half of the season we have not been good enough , ’ said @entity15 , who still seems to bear mental scars from his infamous butt			1
‘ i ’ve not been good enough			0
i let myself down on the touchline			0
i think i ’ve made some calls this year where i could have been more positive tactically			2
it ’s time for reflection			0
’ fans are furious at @entity14 ’s refusal to spend money and chase @entity139 football and cup success			1
they argue he is in a position to do so			0
since the @entity144 owner took control of @entity8 in 2007 for £ 134m , the share price of his sports stores has rocketed from £ 1.60 to £ 7.70			2
in contrast , the club ’s turnover in that period has fallen from £ 129m to £ 106m			0
frugal owner : @entity14 has come under fire from fans for his lack of investment in the team @entity15 let his frustrations show during an interview in october on @entity159 ’s goals on sunday , hinting @entity14 might sometimes hinder the club ’s progress			1
‘ he loves football but he sometimes ca n’t understand how it works , ’ said @entity15			2
‘ it confuses and upsets him , and when he is upset , he does things that are n’t brilliant for the club			0
’ @entity14 was furious and @entity15 ’s position was in jeopardy , far more so than after events at @entity170			1
he was warned about his conduct but survived			0
this week he held the @entity144 annual conference at @entity39			0
employees played darts , whizzed remote - control cars around a track , played table football and watched cricketer @entity178 and @entity180 curler @entity179 in a version of @entity182			0
there was a free bar and @entity185 , once part of the @entity187 , sang to the delighted staff			0
@entity190 legend : @entity191 was voted as fifth most important @entity192 of all time by @entity8 's local paper teams from all over the country played on the pitch as advertising hoardings rolled through a series of messages urging staff to make even more money			2
‘ the sign is red , the sign is blue , the £ 300m is there for you			0
@entity207 for 2014 - 15 £ 300m , the three oh oh , here we go			0
’ ‘ @entity14 ’s @entity209			2
another year another target smashed , bring on the next			0
’ @entity14 revelling in such success will surely rile @entity8 fans further			1
they feel @entity14 is using the club , not helping it			2
across town , a talk was being given on @entity216 , a former @entity8 captain listed as the fourth most important @entity192 of all time in the local newspaper ( @entity191 was fifth )			2
@entity216 helped @entity8 to three @entity219 titles , one @entity220 and another four @entity220 finals at the start of the 1900s			2
what this club would do for a sniff of a trophy now .			0
