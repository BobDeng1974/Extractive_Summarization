@entity0 , director of the @entity2 's @entity1 , oversaw the drafting of the @entity5 's immigration bill			1
her former employer , the @entity7 , stands to reap a windfall as a result a former senior policy analyst at the @entity7 supervised the drafting of a @entity5 bill , passed on june 27 , that would give an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants a path to citizenship if the @entity16 goes along			1
and @entity7 figures to enlarge its budget significantly , thanks to slush funds buried deep in the legislation			2
a bombshell report published thursday by @entity22 shows that the immigration reform bill would set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for @entity7 and other liberal immigrants ' rights groups , which the federal government would contract to assist future @entity28 citizens with applications and offer them legal advice			1
in a separate little - noticed section of the legislation , senators propose to rewrite the laws against counterfeiting passports and the materials used to obtain them			1
those new laws would set a legal threshold of 10 phony passports before a fraudster could be prosecuted for buying , selling or using counterfeit materials used to produce such fake documents			1
another section would exclude serial drunk - drivers from gaining a path to citizenship , but only after they rack up a third dui offense			1
the report came from the @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , an investigative journalism service			0
but ' [ t ] wo prior convictions for this offense , ' the @entity50 reported , ' would not disqualify an immigrant for legalization			0
' and of the language that applies to ' selling or forging materials used in making passports , ' the organization adds , ' the bill says 10 such instances are verboten , [ but ] that nine wo n't be a problem			1
' the slush fund language , however , ' may be the real point of the legislation , ' @entity50 contends			0
' this seems likely since the bill was steered through the @entity5 by the @entity55 @entity2			2
overseeing a team of executive branch bill - drafters ensconced in the @entity93 , guiding the legislative process , was @entity55 director of domestic policy @entity0 , the leading presidential staffer on immigration issues			1
before joining the @entity55 administration , @entity0 was @entity7 's top policy analyst			2
@entity7 did not return a phone call on thursday seeking comment			2
@entity102 @entity101 sen. @entity101 said on thursday that his immigration bill does n't permit any passport counterfeiting , although the legislation 's text says otherwise @entity55 ( @entity107 ) has had his hands full trying to persuade @entity2 @entity109 to endorse the @entity5 bill , while @entity2 spokesman @entity111 ( r ) fends off reporters ' questions about its chances for survival @entity50 calculated that several different pots of taxpayer dollars set aside for immigrants ' rights groups , all on the political left , ' would total almost $ 300 million over three years and grow over time			1
' those include a $ 50 million set - aside for grants to organizations that will advertise benefits available to illegal immigrants , and to help them fill out paperwork			2
another $ 100 million , over the first five years , would be distributed to groups that can set up ' @entity132 ' to help formerly illegal immigrants ' integrate ' into communities in which they may already have lived for years			0
after five years , that amount is at the discretion of the @entity136 , a division of the @entity138			0
$ 120 million more would be spent over three years to mount a campaign educating newly legalized immigrants about ' employer and employee rights , responsibilities and [ legal ] remedies ' available under the new law			0
again , the federal government would ' contract with public and private organizations ' to execute the campaign			0
those groups likely will include @entity7 and the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , says @entity50			2
@entity7 will be ' arguably be at the head of the line to receive new funding , ' it says			0
@entity61 told the organization that it would likely qualify for subsidies if the immigration bill becomes law			1
cutting corners to get one of these ? do n't counterfeit too many if the @entity5 immigration bill becomes law : two will do , but the third could make you a jailbird illegal - immigrant minors exempted from deportation by the @entity55 administration , and their parents , took a mock citizenship oath during a july 10 rally on @entity170 aimed at pressuring @entity171 in addition to language allowing counterfeiters to escape prosecution if their phony materials impacted fewer than ten illegal passports , other language in the @entity5 bill addresses those who actually produce the finished forgeries			1
a 20 year jail sentence is a possibility , but only for a criminal who ' produces , issues , or transfers ... forges , counterfeits , alters , or falsely makes ... [ or ] secures , possesses , uses , receives , buys , sells , or distributes 3 or more [ fake ] passports			0
' current federal law prescribes up to 25 years in federal prison for unauthorized persons who produce or issue ' any passport ' - meaning a single one			2
but under the @entity5 proposal , ' three such instances are forbidden , meaning two would be permitted , ' the @entity22 story concluded			0
sen. @entity101 , an @entity102 @entity101 who supported the bill , told the conservative @entity202 a different story on thursday			0
' i do n't think that we stand for any forgeries , ' @entity101 said			0
@entity7 highlighted this stroller - brigade immigration protest on @entity208			1
in future years , taxpayers could be subsidizing the group to help these immigrants learn how to apply for citizenship benefits note : the reporter participates in the @entity50 's media advisory board .			0

the @entity7 is likely to benefit from grant money set aside in an immigration bill drafted by its former policy director
legislation passed in the @entity5 would exclude three - time @entity223 *offenders* from a path to citizenship , but two - time drunk drivers would be *acceptable*
passport forgers would no longer be prosecuted for making a single fake travel document , with the bar being set at three
document counterfeiters whose materials are used to obtain passports would only be jailed if they contributed to at least 10 phony passports
