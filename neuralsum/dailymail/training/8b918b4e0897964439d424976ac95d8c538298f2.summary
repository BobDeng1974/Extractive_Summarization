by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:55 pm on 30th october 2011 after being call all kinds of names and had their industry demonized , it does n't come as an exact shock to hear that the country 's wealthy are donating the least to the @entity10 protests			1
online fundraising site @entity11 said that people earning over $ 250,000 have only donated 1.39 per cent of the cause 's cash , falling very closely in line with their representation as the country 's wealthiest one per cent			2
this news comes as protesters face increased police opposition across the country			2
getting handouts : donations of cash and various food have helped sustain protesters who are staying in @entity30 's @entity29 the site has accumulated a total of $ 325,000 to the protesters , with the majority coming from the self - proclaimed middle class			1
people that decided to make donations online were asked by the site to give their annual income to allow for demographic analysis			2
of those donations , 60 per cent were given by people who claim that they make between $ 35,000 and $ 100,000			2
' the middle class is really giving the bulk of the money , ' said @entity46 , the ceo of @entity11			0
' in the last 30 days , donations have really snowballed as more movements have joined @entity10 , ' he continued			1
manhandled : a protester is grabbed by police officers during the unrest in @entity52 on saturday the donations are spread across the country and the world , as sympathizers in 36 different countries , including @entity58 and the @entity59			1
all 50 states are financially represented , and the geographic break down helps to paint a clearer picture of where the country stands on the movement			0
@entity66 residents have given the most , with the average donation coming in at $ 65.15 , with @entity68 and @entity69 following suit staying within a dollar above and below the $ 60 mark respectively			0
@entity73 had the lowest average donation with only $ 16.25 , and @entity75 came in second to last with $ 20.50			0
interestingly , those figures fall along party lines : the three highest paying states voted for the @entity81 @entity80 in the 2008 while @entity82 and @entity75 voted for @entity83 , the @entity84 nominee			2
staying power : though many protests have come since the original , @entity30 seems to have the most momentum as they hit the one month mark on october 17 anniversary dates - like @entity30 's one month mark on october 17 - and big media spectacles - often caused by police violence - prompt more people to open the purse strings , serving as big money days for the site			1
given the weekend 's incidents at some protests , it seems like there will be many more of those days to come			1
a tense standoff between occupy @entity52 protesters and authorities near the @entity107 @entity106 erupted saturday with a surge of demonstrators being met with police force that included pepper spray and rubber bullets			1
grounded : a man is arrested after clashing with police during the @entity52 protest after a march through the downtown district the clash came as @entity10 protesters and state officials in @entity121 squared off for a third consecutive night saturday , even though a local judge has refused to jail demonstrators who have been arrested and said the state lacks the authority to set a curfew on the property			1
these violent blow ups come at the same time as groups of over 30 people were arrested in both @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 , @entity134 in the late hours of saturday night and early morning of sunday			1
arrested : @entity52 police handcuff a man after a tense standoff on the steps of the state @entity106 and @entity139 in @entity30 , where the @entity10 movement began last month , a mix of snow , rain and slush made for sheer misery at the encampment in @entity29 in lower @entity147			1
drenched protesters hunkered down in tents and under tarps as the plaza filled with rainwater and melted snow			0
technically , tents are banned in the park , but protesters say authorities have been looking the other way , even despite a crackdown on generators that were keeping them warm			2
' i want to thank the @entity163 , ' said 32 - year - old protester @entity164 , decked out in a yellow slicker and rain pants			0
' we 're not supposed to have tents			0
we 're not supposed to have sleeping bags			0
you go to @entity171 , they do n't have it			0
you go to @entity174 , you do n't have it			0
' weapons raised : mayhem as the protesters face the wrath of heavily equipped police officers			0

donations tend to rise and fall depending on the state 's *politics*
comes as protests grow violent and police use rubber bullets in @entity52
over 30 arrested in @entity131 and *38* in @entity133 as police crackdown
