@entity0 has fallen out of a list of the top ten most powerful people in the world for the first time since he became prime minister			1
@entity6 now ranks him less important than @entity7 , chief executive of @entity8 , which owns @entity9			1
now ranked 11th , having fallen one place , mr @entity0 is derided by the influential @entity12 business magazine for ‘ a flip - flop approach to green taxes ’			1
supermarket sweep : @entity0 has dropped out of the top 10 of the @entity18 list for the first time since becoming prime minister , making way for @entity8 president and ceo @entity7 it added : ‘ @entity24 guides the world ’s sixth - largest economy and was once hailed as the second coming of @entity28			1
’ it marks a dramatic drop for mr @entity0 , who only two years ago was ranked seventh most powerful person in the world after sweeping in to power			1
confirming his position at 11th on the list , the magazine added : ‘ he has recently been criticised for a flip - flop approach to green taxes after he pledged to slash the tax on household energy bills amid soaring gas and electricity prices			2
‘ he has two years to galvanise the @entity44 ahead of a 2015 general election			0
’ top two : @entity48 president @entity47 is ranked number one most powerful person in the world , while @entity12 president @entity52 is number two @entity55 's chancellor @entity54 is number five , down from number two last year pope @entity58 has moved up one place to number four 1			1

@entity0 , @entity79 prime minister ( 10 ) mr @entity0 will also feel uncomfortable that in the 500 - word citation , the magazine also notes that he is and ‘ @entity82 graduate and ( illegitimate ) descendent of @entity84 ( 1830 - 1837 ) ’			1
three years ago @entity6 said mr @entity86 's determination to slash government expenditures ’			2
but since then it has grown increasingly unimpressed with the @entity91 leader , warning last year how he faced a ‘ disillusioned electorate and rumblings from his own party over @entity79 's future ’			2
by comparison the 2012 @entity96 notes how mr @entity7 is chief of the world 's number one retailer and biggest private employer , with 2.2 million workers			1
it adds : ‘ @entity8 can make or break a company simply by deciding to stock its product			2
’ @entity8 bought @entity79 supermarket chain @entity9 in 1999 , and it now employees 175,000 people in the @entity79			1
@entity6 ’ annual list , chosen by the influential magazine ’s editors , has also demoted @entity52 who had been number one every year since he was elected @entity12 president in 2009			1
he has become a ‘ lame duck ’ , says the magazine which puts him at number two behind @entity60 despite the @entity48 leader ’s terrible record on human rights			0
@entity120 , executive editor at @entity6 , said : ‘ there is a fundamental difference between a good person and a powerful person			1
if we were doing a list of the most palatable people in the world it would be very different			2
’ @entity65 premier @entity62 is at number three in the list up from ninth last year , pope francis number four , up one , and @entity55 chancellor @entity54 was the top - placed woman at number five , down from number two in 2012			2
@entity135 tycoon and philanthropist @entity67 takes the sixth place , down from fourth , @entity12 @entity72 chairman @entity70 is at number seven down from sixth and @entity138 's @entity73 is down one at eight and @entity77 president @entity75 down one place at nine			2
the magazine ranked the 72 people on the list - one for every 100 million people on earth - according to how many people they have power over ; the financial resources they control ; if they have influence in more than one sphere ; and how actively they wield their power to change the world			2
in the @entity152 today , mr @entity0 was accused of going from ' @entity153 to @entity154 ' in just four years			1
labour leader @entity155 claimed @entity0 had once spoken of tough action to make sure household bills fell when wholesale prices dropped			1
but he claimed the so - called @entity159 should now be called the @entity160 because mr @entity0 backed them			0
ridicule : the prime minister was accused of going from ' @entity153 to @entity154 ' by @entity163 leader @entity155 mr @entity155 said : ' in opposition , you said there was a problem in the relationship between wholesale and retail prices and you went on to say , the first thing you 've got to do is give the regulator the teeth to order those reductions are made			1
and that is what we would do			0
' why , when it comes to the energy companies , has it gone from @entity153 to @entity154 in four short years ? ' but mr @entity0 replied : ' who was it gave us the @entity159 ? yes , when @entity163 first looked at this there were almost 20 companies but because of your stewardship we ended up with six players			1
' you talk about a price freeze but down the corridor , they ( @entity163 ) have been voting for a price rise - that is right			0
they voted for a de-carbonisation target that everyone accepts would rise prices			0
