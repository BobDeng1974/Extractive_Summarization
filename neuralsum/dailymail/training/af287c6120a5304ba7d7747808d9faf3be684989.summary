a grandmother from @entity1 has completed a gruelling 1,460 mile run across @entity3 for charity			1
during the ultra run , @entity5 , 52 , had to pull on her trainers every morning for 32 consecutive days and run through challenging terrain			1
her journey followed the @entity10 , an off - road route starting in @entity12 and finishing in @entity13 , just outside @entity14			1
@entity5 was joined on the epic journey by @entity17 ultra runner @entity16 , 29 , and their route took them over mountains , across rivers and through private game reserves full of wild animals including leopards , rhinos and wildebeests			1
two generations united in one cause : @entity5 , 52 , left , and @entity16 , 29 , ran 56 marathons back to back for charity @entity33 journey on foot : aided by a support crew including @entity36 , centre , the pair had to navigate their own route along the @entity10 in @entity3 along with a support crew , the pair had to navigate their own way to complete the challenge that involved running a total of 56 marathons back - to - back			1
speaking after completing the 32 - day run , @entity5 told @entity48 how difficult it had been thanks to the conditions			1
she said : ' there are sections along the route where tracks simply do n't exist , so we would find ourselves going through thorn bushes , crawling in the undergrowth and at one point even walking down a river as it was easier than trying to trudge through seven feet high thick reeds			0
' during the first week we climbed to the highest point along the route of 2,700m above sea level , the wind was so strong that we nearly got blown off our feet , but the views from the top were worth the long tough 8k climb up , it was like standing on top of the world			0
' at one point we got to the top of a very high hill and it looked as though the only way down was to fly			0
thankfully we discovered an extremely rocky , very steep decent down to the valley floor , in places we were on our bottoms in order to continue down			0
' she added : ' on the last day it took us six hours to do 10k , the terrain was nothing but rocks , very steep ascents and decents , climbing down waterfalls to get back down to the river , fighting our way through dense undergrowth and finishing with a very steep climb out of the valley , again at points having to use our hands for help			2
' gruelling : the challenge involved scaling mountains and running on uneven terrain			0
pictured with @entity5 , centre , and @entity16 , right , is another of their support crew , @entity99 , left @entity5 is no stranger to distance running having completed ultra races including the @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 ( she did ' the double ' at the latter two by turning around and running the route back as soon as she finished )			1
she also holds the @entity107 for the fastest crossing of @entity109 on foot and fastest time run by a female from @entity112 to @entity113			0
but despite her many accomplishments , @entity5 said her latest challenge was ' one of the hardest things she has ever done			1
' speaking about why she wanted to do it , she said : ' running an average of 80km per day for 32 days is n't something to be taken lightly and technical running is n't my forte			2
' but i believe that in order to grow as a person we all need to do things that take us way out of our comfort zone , each time pushing just that little bit further – this project will push me further than i have ever pushed myself before , in many ways			0
' super gran : @entity5 has previously run the double @entity133 in soaring temperatures in @entity136 's @entity135 among her other achievements pushing limits of endurance : @entity5 , pictured taking part in the @entity141 , said the 1,460 mile run across @entity3 was her toughest challenge yet @entity5 and @entity16 put themselves though the long - distance run with the support of @entity147 in order to raise money for girls and women in @entity3			1
so far they have raised 40,494 @entity17 dollars ( £ 22,000 )			2
' both of us felt that if we were to take on a challenge as big as this we wanted to raise money to help @entity3 girls and women			2
@entity16 is 29 and i 'm 52 , two women , two generations and two pairs of legs supporting others , ' @entity5 said			1
they are aiming to raise awareness and funds to set up of a social enterprise business in the @entity167 of @entity3 that will employ a dozen @entity3 women to make re-usable sanitary pads in order to keep girls in education			2
the pair were shocked at how many girls are missing out on school because of a lack of adequate sanitary products			0
@entity5 explained : ' once they reach puberty , one in three @entity3 girls miss out on four or five days of school per month because they can not afford to buy sanitary pads			1
instead they stay at home and use anything from old rags and rolled up newspapers - anything they can get their hands on			0
eventually they drop out of school altogether			0
' the grandmother - of - three said thinking of the charity kept her pushing on when the going got tough during the run			2
despite the gruelling nature of the event , she was delighted to finish without sustaining any injuries			0
she said : ' luckily for me i had no real issues apart from a small blister on my left foot , my 52 year old body held up really well ! ' donations to @entity204 can still be made at @entity205			0

she had to pull on her trainers every morning for 32 consecutive days
