in her new book , the alpha woman meets her match , dr @entity4 says that @entity9 women have never had it better , except they are looking for love in all the wrong places			1
instead of trying to find a similar @entity9 boyfriend , strong women should look for ‘ @entity15 ’ men ; those who are n’t threatened by her success and are just as happy at home changing nappies than thrashing out a @entity21 presentation			1
power struggle : @entity9 women are attracted to strong , assertive men just like them , but should seek a beta male partner , says new book , the alpha woman meets her match ‘ more and more women are making more money than men now , ’ says dr @entity4 , who has been a therapist in @entity28 for 30 years			1
‘ these are the social and economic conditions into which the @entity9 woman has come into her own and , just like the @entity9 man , she is strong , confident , goal - oriented and assertive			0
’ dr @entity4 explains that @entity9 women in the @entity37 tend to think that they ’ve missed the chance of marriage because they ’ve spent so long concentrating on their careers			1
but this is not the case			0
in fact , getting married later can actually have its benefits			0
uncoupling : was the reason couples @entity47 and @entity49 ' @entity48 ' @entity46 , left , and @entity50 and @entity51 , right , split up because they are all @entity9 ? ‘ women are now leaving it until they are more mature , until their career has developed and they ’re in a better place to choose their partners , ’ she tells @entity52 of the @entity53			2
‘ they just need to start looking past the competitive , domineering alpha male			0

’ the book , published in the @entity81 on 22 may , promises to help you find mr @entity83 , not mr @entity84			2
dr @entity4 argues that some @entity9 women struggle to find the right partner because they are attracted to @entity9 men but , ultimately the relationship ends in a power struggle			1
‘ @entity9 women may believe the @entity59 is their natural partner - a breadwinner , similar to her , ’ she tells the @entity53			1
‘ but although they might make an exciting relationship , they do n’t make a good relationship because one will always want to assert their authority			0
