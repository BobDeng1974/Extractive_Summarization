@entity0 has admitted to enduring sleepless nights before realising he no longer had the answers to halt @entity4 ’s slide in form			1
the 50 - year - old released an emotional open letter to supporters on the @entity4 website , reflecting on both the remarkable achievements of his four - year spell at @entity12 and the thinking behind his decision to step down			1
@entity0 resigned as manager on sunday evening , 48 hours after his side suffered a fifth successive defeat with a 2 - 1 loss at @entity19			1
@entity0 quit as @entity4 manager after failing to halt his side 's slide in recent weeks @entity4 's defeat to @entity19 was their fifth in succession and proved to be @entity0 's final game the former @entity28 midfielder feared his own despondency at being unable to turn results around could have a further negative impact on the squad			1
that led him to the conclusion it was best to step aside , with assistant manager @entity36 in caretaker charge for friday ’s visit of @entity39 while the process of appointing a replacement begins			0
‘ i struggled to sleep after friday ’s game with @entity19 then woke up again during the night , saturday into sunday , thinking about the @entity39 game and i just could n’t come up with any answers , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i felt that with the international break coming up , now would be a good time to step aside to allow the club time			1
‘ i have a hope that with a fresh voice and maybe some new ideas , it will give the players that little boost they need			0
i felt that if i did n’t have the same hunger or desire , if i was deflated , then the players would sense that and that ’s not what they , or the club , needs at this point			1
‘ this season has been difficult and when you become apprehensive about the next game , that ’s your body ’s way of telling you that maybe things have come to an end			2
‘ both as a player and manager , you should work all week and really look forward to matches , but if you have that negativity in your head , it ’s difficult and i do n’t want that to make our situation any worse			0
i care too much about the place and the people who work here			0
’ while his last few months in charge were painful , @entity0 ’s tenure will go down in @entity4 ’s history as one of great success			1
back - to - back runners - up finishes in the league were joined by continental adventures in the @entity85 and @entity86 , as well as an appearance in the @entity88			2
@entity0 helped @entity4 to the qualifying stages of the @entity85 where they lost to @entity90 @entity0 also took @entity4 to the @entity88 final where they lost to @entity92 at @entity93 ‘ it ’s fair to say that the last 24 hours or so have been incredibly difficult and emotional for me personally , ’ he said			1
‘ however , it has also given me time to reflect on what has been four wonderful years			0
‘ seeing what getting to a national final meant to the fans , and also the town itself , is something that will live with me forever			0
‘ i think back to the night we beat @entity104 to qualify for the @entity85 , then the atmosphere at @entity12 for that game against @entity90			0
for a lot of our players , that was the highlight of their career , playing at that level			0
‘ i remember coming back from 2 - 0 down at @entity113 to win and no one will ever forget that game at @entity116 ( on the last day of last season )			2
that will go down as one of the best days i ’ve ever had in football			0
‘ i just hope the amount of highs cancel out some of the disappointments when people look back at what we ’ve achieved here			0
’ @entity0 paid glowing tribute to his players , backroom team , club directors , office staff and supporters for their ‘ invaluable ’ assistance			1
‘ i would ask you all to rally around the club and the players in the next few weeks and months , ’ he added			2
‘ nothing would give me more pleasure if i am back up the road next may with my claret and amber scarf , with the team having picked up in the league , watching @entity4 at the @entity88 once again			2

@entity0 brought an end to his four - year reign as @entity4 boss
