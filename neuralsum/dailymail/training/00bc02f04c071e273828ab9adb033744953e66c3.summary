he said he had hoped for a still longer sentence — but , he added , a decade is better than a month @entity1 district judge @entity9 pronounces a 10 - year prison sentence with another five years suspended for former teacher @entity8 convicted of raping one of his students tragedy : the victim @entity36 killed herself while the case against @entity8 was pending ' the criminal justice system worked today , ' he said			1
@entity57 , the father of the victim , had hoped for a longer sentence but said it was better than the one - month previously serviced by @entity8			2
during the hearing , @entity50 asked judge @entity9 to reject defense attempts to make the victim 's conduct in the case a factor in @entity8 's sentencing			2

' there has to be punishment			0
' @entity8 's attorney , @entity102 , responded that there was no statute preventing the court from considering @entity36 's conduct			1
he pointed out that similar objections were never raised by prosecutors during @entity8 's first sentence , and said they were seeking a ' do - over , ' which @entity111 asserted was not allowed under state and federal law			1
outrageous : @entity8 has previously said that his 14 - year - old victim @entity114 ( pictured here ) was responsible for his actions because she appeared older than her actual age district judge @entity118 : baughsentenced @entity8 to one - month in jail in 2013			1

' i do not mention this for the sake of sympathy , but it has been hard			0
' @entity50 asked the court to impose a 10 - year prison sentence with another 10 years suspended			1
that is the same sentence prosecutors sought last year when the case was before @entity45 , who instead adopted the much more lenient term suggested by @entity8 's defense attorney			2
without @entity36 , their primary witness , prosecutors struck a deal with @entity8 that initially allowed him to avoid prison altogether			1
@entity8 , however , violated that agreement by having unauthorized visits with relatives ' children and entering into a relationship with an adult woman without telling his counselor			0
as a result , the case was revived and @entity8 pleaded guilty last year to the count of sexual intercourse without consent			2
@entity9 sentenced @entity8 ( pictured here ) after a 90 - minute hearing that included testimony from the victim 's mother and father and @entity8 's probation and parole officer tthe victim ’s age , @entity8 ’s position as a teacher and his response to being warned by school officials all factored into his sentencing			1
@entity8 did n’t force himself on his victim and has completed sex offender treatment during the first sentencing , @entity45 suggested the victim had as much control over her rape as the defendant and said she ' appeared older than her chronological age			2
' he gave @entity8 a 15 - year term with all but one month suspended			1
that triggered an appeal from prosecutors and ultimately resulted in the case being reassigned to @entity192			0
@entity45 's comments and the lenient sentence he handed down landed him before the state @entity41 for disciplinary proceedings , which resulted in a 30 - day suspension from the bench and a public censure for his misconduct in the case			1
in a sentencing memorandum filed this week , @entity50 wrote that a tough sentence for @entity8 was warranted given his position of authority over @entity36			2
' his position of trust as a high school teacher , abuse of that position , and violations against the victim overshadows all mitigating circumstances , ' @entity50 wrote .			0

@entity8 , 55 , was sentenced to 30 - days in jail in august 2013 for the rape of 14 - year - old @entity36
@entity218 outrageously said that @entity36 shared responsibility for the rape because she seemed older than she was
@entity36 took her own life in @entity223 was *47* when the crime *occurred*
an appeals process has now resulted in a re-sentencing
the prosecution had been pushing for 20 years in a state prison
