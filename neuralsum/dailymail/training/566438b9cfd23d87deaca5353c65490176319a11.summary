by @entity0 published : 20:23 est , 25 january 2014 updated : 20:49 est , 25 january 2014 backlash : @entity3 addresses the @entity4 yesterday @entity5 was facing a damaging split last night after allies of @entity8 accused @entity9 of taking the party back to the 1970s when it vowed to ‘ tax the rich until the pips squeak ’			1
the backlash came after shadow chancellor @entity3 said that a future @entity15 would raise the top rate of income tax from 45p in the pound to 50p for those earning over £ 150,000 , reversing a cut made by @entity20			1
mr @entity3 claimed the increase was vital to reduce the budget deficit ‘ more fairly ’			1
@entity23 and union leaders hailed the initiative as a ‘ populist vote - winner ’ that could propel the party into power at next year ’s general election			1
but the tax hike was attacked by powerful figures close to mr @entity8 , who claimed it was a ‘ lurch to the @entity37 ’ reminiscent of @entity33 , when the top rate of tax rose to 83p – and 98p when unearned income was added			1
one of mr @entity8 ’s key supporters said : ‘ this takes @entity5 back to the 1970s			1
it ’s goodbye to the enterprise economy with knobs on			1
' it is a return to the outmoded idea that you are for or against the poor			1
the whole point of @entity5 was it showed you could help the poor and wealth creators at the same time			1
‘ @entity9 and @entity49 are turning their backs on that			1
@entity9 thinks he is redesigning capitalism with the same fervour that @entity54 did , and talks grandly of helping the low - paid by the “ predistribution ” of wealth instead of redistribution			2
‘ the trouble is they are economically illiterate and have no understanding of business or profits			2
’ former labour city minister @entity64 said : ‘ we need to encourage productive enterprise and effort rather than resort to predatory taxation			2
it ’s not clear how this is going to help the @entity73 economy compete with the world ’s growth economies			2
' the @entity73 already has an income tax system that is more progressive than most of our international competitors			2
’ his comments were echoed by business leaders , including @entity82 , director - general of the @entity83 , who urged @entity5 to ‘ drop its practice of knee - jerk reversion to the old @entity87 nostrums that so damaged @entity73 ’s economy in the past ’			1
why is @entity3 announcing this plan now ? @entity5 argues that , with 15 months to go until the 2015 election , it is time to set out its core economic policies			1
the @entity94 say that mr @entity3 has been thrown into crisis by the success of @entity97 ’s deficit - cutting , and needs to rescue his career with an eye - catching @entity100 proportion of total tax revenue comes from the highest earners ? the top one per cent – those earning more than £ 160,000 – accounted for 30 per cent of all income tax last @entity108 top earners contributing more than they used to ? the proportion of income tax paid by the top one per cent has risen from a fifth to a third in a @entity111 the 50p rate raise extra money ? balls claims that between 2010 and 2013 , when the 50p top - rate applied , the tax take from £ 150,000 - plus earners rose by more than £ 3 billion a year			2
@entity97 says the additional revenue from 50p was just £ 500 million a year – with the rest coming from crackdowns on tax - dodging and a surge in the economy			2
the @entity124 says the lost tax revenue from cutting the rate from 50p to 45p last year was just £ 100 million			2
how does the @entity73 compare with other countries ? @entity128 has the top rate – those earning more than € 1million pay 75 per cent			2
the @entity73 ’s 45p rate is the 11th highest in @entity132 – but it ’s still above the @entity134 top rate of 39.6 per cent and the @entity136 average of 37.9 per cent			2
how many people will pay the top rate ? in 2011 , 236,000 paid tax at the 50p rate , out of 31 million taxpayers in the @entity73			1
and sir @entity141 , the former @entity142 chairman and current head of @entity144 , added : ‘ this is a very bad idea – it will put in jeopardy all the good work that has been done to put the economy back on track			1
‘ it will send out worrying messages to the wrong people , and will risk confidence and investment			1
my biggest single worry is why , when we have come all this way , would you want to risk that with a move like this ? ‘ interest rates remain low and the government says they will continue to do so ; confidence is returning , people are coming back to work			1
the signs are the economy is improving			2
‘ this move is tokenistic			1
it ’s a small amount of money coming from an income bracket that contributes heavily to income tax with a potentially damaging effect on confidence			2
’ mr @entity49 ’s speech yesterday came after accusations that he miscalculated by claiming the @entity176 ’ ‘ austerity @entity73 ’ package of savage spending cuts would make the recession worse			1
instead , there is growing evidence that the economy is on the mend			0
mr @entity3 said the last @entity15 ’s decision to lift the top rate to 50p resulted in those earning over £ 150,000 paying an extra £ 10 billion in tax over three years			0
but the @entity176 pointed out that the @entity189 disputes this , claiming it raises less than £ 1 billion a year and has a damaging effect on job creation			0
mr @entity3 said @entity5 also wanted a lower 10p starting rate of tax for those on middle and lower incomes			0
‘ when the deficit is still high and for ordinary families , real incomes are falling and taxes have risen , it can not be right for @entity20 and [ @entity97 ] @entity97 to give the richest people in the country a huge tax cut , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s why the next @entity15 will reverse the top - rate tax cut			0
‘ we will create a fairer tax system , crack down on tax avoidance and reverse the cut for hedge funds			0
those with the broadest shoulders should bear a fairer share of the burden			0
’ @entity5 has already indicated it plans to impose a ‘ mansion tax ’ on homes worth over £ 2 million			0
his speech to the @entity5 - supporting @entity4 follows a series of rows with mr @entity9 and other colleagues			0
last november , @entity222 revealed how an email from mr @entity9 ’s office described mr @entity3 as a ‘ nightmare ’			0
and earlier this month we disclosed how mr @entity3 had to be ‘ dragged apart ’ from shadow foreign secretary @entity226			0
furthermore , @entity176 @entity23 have taunted mr @entity3 for abandoning his ‘ flatlining ’ gesture – in which he waved the palm of his hand horizontally at mr @entity20 and mr @entity97 in @entity232 clashes – representing the ‘ flatlining ’ economy			0
the recent rise in growth figures has forced him to keep his hands by his side			0
on the face of it , @entity3 ’s plan to raise the top - rate of tax to 50p is a vote - winner			0
it is supported by six out of ten adults overall , with fewer than one in five against			0
even @entity176 supporters favour it by a small margin			0
but the problem for mr @entity3 and @entity5 leader @entity9 is that voters do not trust them – or their motives			0
that is the deeper picture that emerges from a @entity256 poll for @entity222 carried out immediately after mr @entity3 ’s dramatic announcement yesterday			1
nearly half of voters say the 50p plan stems from @entity5 ’s desire to target the rich for its own sake , with just 32 per cent siding with mr @entity3 ’s claim that it is a vital source of extra revenue for the public purse			0
and if mr @entity3 thought his pledge to balance the books by 2020 would convince people the economy is safe in his hands , he has more reassuring to do – 57 per cent say he will not achieve it , with 22 per cent won over			1
voters are evenly divided on claims made by some business leaders that the tax hike for the well - off will force entrepreneurs to flee @entity73 , as a wealth tax has done in @entity128			0
a total of 38 per cent say this will happen against 40 per cent who say it wo n’t			0
regardless of its populist appeal , mr @entity3 ’s 50p tax plan has not seen his ratings overtake those of @entity97			0
a total of 28 per cent trust @entity3 balls to run the economy , with mr @entity97 on 34			0
@entity256 pollster @entity290 said : ‘ the 50p income tax proposal is clearly popular in itself – even a fair number of conservative voters approve of it			1
but the problem for mr @entity3 is he lacks credibility			0

@entity8 allies accuse the @entity299 of ' economic illiteracy '
they say ' @entity87 ' move takes the party back to days of @entity305
