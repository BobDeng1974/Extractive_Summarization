for years , @entity1 ' parents were sure they knew who had kidnapped the first - grader on his way to school in 1979 , and they devoted themselves to trying to hold him accountable			2
testimony will soon start in the murder trial they so long awaited — with a different man at the defense table , a man never suspected until he gave a 2012 confession he now disavows			2
the trial partly reflects @entity15 and @entity17 ' efforts to keep the investigation going and make missing children a national priority			1
but it stands to be both searing and complex for the parents , who had pressed authorities to prosecute the earlier suspect — a convicted @entity28 child molester — and even brought their own wrongful - death suit against him			1
agony : the @entity17 's long pursued convicted child molester @entity31 ( left ) in the disappearance of their 6 - year - old son @entity33			1
they pressed authorities to pursue charges against him and even filed their own wrongful death suit			1
however , now a different man -- @entity40 ( right ) -- is headed to trial in his death ' sometimes i think the worst thing that could happen , ' @entity17 once said , ' would be never knowing what happened to @entity33			1
' jury selection is underway for @entity40 ' trial in one of the first missing - child cases ever featured on milk cartons			1
@entity40 , a former shop worker in the @entity52 ' neighborhood , denies the charges			0
his lawyers say his confessions were fiction spurred by mental illness			0
horrific : @entity40 gave police a videotaped confession to luring @entity33 to a basement with a soda , choking him and dumping his still - living body in a box with some curbside trash the @entity52 declined to comment on the case last week			1
@entity17 is expected to testify ; it 's not clear whether her husband will			1
the @entity52 — he a photographer , she a day care provider , together parents of three — became the very visible center of an exhaustive investigation after 6 - year - old @entity33 vanished while walking two blocks to a school bus stop on may 25 , 1979			1
their loft in @entity78 's then - edgy @entity77 neighborhood became a makeshift police command post and media center , their phone an ever - ringing hotline			1

' they were unassuming people who were living their lives , being part of their community , being friends with their neighbors , raising their children			0
and this happened to them , ' says @entity97 , the author of 2009 's ' after @entity33 : the @entity98			2

complex case : @entity15 and @entity17 went to the painful step of having @entity33 legally declared dead so they could sue @entity31 , who 's no longer a suspect the crime			1
they 've not commented on the case against @entity40 but are likely to testify ' his brave parents have fought to increase our awareness of this tragedy ' and improve enforcement , president @entity134 's 1983 proclamation said			1
meanwhile , police came across a new suspect : @entity142 , who had dated a woman who sometimes walked @entity33 home from school			0
@entity31 would later be accused of sexually assaulting boys in @entity28 and serve over 25 years on his convictions			1
and he told authorities about interacting with a boy he thought could be @entity33 on the day he disappeared , though @entity31 said he had n't killed the boy			1
he has since denied having anything to do with @entity33 's disappearance			2
the @entity99 took the painful step of having @entity33 legally declared dead so they could sue @entity31			2
after he stopped cooperating with questioning , a civil court held him responsible for @entity33 's death			2
but prosecutors said there was n't enough evidence to charge anyone			0

the prosecution team , led by veteran @entity78 assistant district attorney @entity199 , has n't alluded to any physical evidence against @entity40 , and his defense has said there is none			2
it recently emerged that an inmate informant will testify against @entity40 , but the person 's identity and details of the prospective testimony have n't been released			2
in his video - recorded confessions , @entity40 tranquilly recounts offering soda to entice @entity33 into the convenience store basement and choking him			1
he says he put the still - living boy into a plastic bag , boxed up the bag and left it on a street			0
prosecutors call the confessions credible , and @entity78 state @entity221 @entity220 ruled they could be used at trial			0
the decision followed a weekslong hearing on whether @entity40 was properly advised of his rights to stay silent and mentally capable of understanding them			0
the defense @entity40 's defense maintains his confessions are the false imaginings of a man who has an iq in the lowest 2 percent of the population and has problems discerning reality from fiction			2
he has taken anti-psychotic medication for years and has been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder , which includes the characteristics of social isolation and odd beliefs			0
the defense — led by @entity244 , who has handled other murder cases involving psychiatric issues — and the prosecution differ on the extent and implications of @entity40 's mental problems			2
the defense may ask the jury to consider that police questioned @entity40 for more than six hours before reading him his rights and turning on recorders			0
the defense also wants jurors to hear about longtime suspect @entity142 , a convicted @entity28 child molester			1

@entity40 's attorneys maintain his confessions are the false imaginings of a man who has an iq in the lowest 2 percent of the population @entity286 got involved in @entity78 district attorney races to make his disappointment known			1
current @entity289 pledged to take a fresh look at the case after he took office in 2010 , and publicity about investigative efforts in 2012 helped unleash the tip that led police to @entity40			0
