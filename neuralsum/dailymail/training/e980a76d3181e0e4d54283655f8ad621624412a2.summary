by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:36 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 26 june 2013 @entity3 , pictured at the @entity4 in 2011 , was allegedly taped when he met officers with his legal counsel			2
neither he nor his lawyer were aware they were being recorded , according to a police source who spoke to the @entity11 @entity12 was last night investigating new claims that its officers secretly bugged meetings with @entity17 ’s best friend			1
@entity3 , who was with the teenager on the night he was murdered , was allegedly monitored as he met detectives with his lawyer			1
sources claimed the force was given permission to record two meetings as they hunted those behind the 1993 racist murder			1
but details of the clandestine operation raised further questions about the treatment of the @entity17 family and their supporters			1
it came as sir @entity32 said he would support a public inquiry into claims undercover officers were used in a smear operation			2
but the @entity38 chief warned that it could be slow and inconclusive , with any criminal allegations sent back to police for investigation			1
@entity17 ’s father @entity43 has demanded a judge - led inquiry , dismissing as ‘ completely unsatisfactory ’ plans to examine the allegations within the scope of two ongoing inquiries			1
his second son @entity50 said the expensive process could be avoided if sir @entity32 answered ‘ 13 questions ’ about the controversy submitted by his lawyer			2
claims that police bugged mr @entity3 will inflame the crisis at the @entity38 over its use of undercover officers and secretive tactics			1
now a councillor in @entity63 , @entity64 , mr @entity3 ’s life was thrown into turmoil in the wake of the killing			2
the two teenagers were standing at a bus stop when a gang of youths attacked them and stabbed @entity17 to death			1
it is claimed that the bugged meetings were held in an interview room at the offices of @entity77 , in @entity78 , @entity79 , in 1999 or 2000			2
just weeks after @entity17 ’s racist murder , the teenager ’s distraught parents publicly accused extremists of trying to make political capital out of his death			1
@entity43 and @entity97 accused @entity98 of using the killing as an excuse for political violence			0
in may 1993 , they called for a march planned by the @entity104 and the left - wing organisation @entity106 to be cancelled			0
the two groups are likely to have been among those monitored by undercover officers in case they resorted to violence			0
mrs @entity97 told the @entity112 : ‘ when the @entity106 people came to me , i was really frightened of them			0
we told them to back off			0
we do not want to know			0
’ mr @entity17 added : ‘ we are aware there are people who want to make this into something else			1
they have organised these demonstrations without consulting us			0
’ she said : ‘ that is very worrying for @entity3 and for ourselves because it is quite sinister			2
why covertly record a meeting that you have asked for ? ‘ why unless it is part of something much bigger , why unless in fact covert recordings were happening of @entity3 and ourselves in different situations ? that is what we want to know			0
’ one former @entity12 detective said : ‘ there is no reason not to record a significant witness , in fact it ’s good practice			0
' but officers should be open about it , and ask the witness and his lawyers first			0
doing it covertly is underhand and could later undermine trust			0
’ earlier this week a police whistle - blower claimed senior officers wanted him to help ‘ smear ’ the @entity17 family			1
former undercover officer @entity149 said he was sent in to infiltrate anti-racist groups that supported the @entity17 family			1

mr @entity149 said he was asked to provide intelligence on ‘ subversives ’ , which included young students with links to radical politics			0
he said they included mr @entity161 and @entity169 mps @entity168 and @entity170			0
mr @entity3 was paid £ 100,000 compensation seven years ago after a marathon legal battle over his treatment by police			0
a @entity38 spokesman said an investigation was launched yesterday after a letter was received from mr @entity3 ’s lawyer			1

follow this link to order a copy police chiefs feared there would be year - long riots if they went public about trying to smear the @entity17 family			1
@entity149 , the ex-police spy turned whistleblower , said senior @entity38 officials had discussed whether to disclose the undercover operation to the 1998 @entity196			1
but he claimed that , fearing a huge backlash against such abhorrent tactics , they opted for a cover - up			2
mr @entity149 , who personally spied on the @entity17 family , said the view of special branch commanders was that ‘ if the public was to find out you were undercover there , they ’d still be battling on the streets for about a year to come ’			1
former home secretary @entity161 said the claim was ‘ very serious ’			2
ex-met commissioner @entity210 , who was in charge at the time , said he did not authorise or condone any withholding of information from @entity214			0
