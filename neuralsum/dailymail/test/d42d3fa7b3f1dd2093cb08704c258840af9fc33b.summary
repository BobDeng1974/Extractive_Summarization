@entity1 secretary of state @entity0 and @entity3 foreign minister @entity2 met monday for the first time since world powers and @entity3 sealed a framework agreement on april 2 that would limit @entity3 's ability to build a nuclear weapon			1
they now have little more than two months to meet their own deadline of june 30 to sign a comprehensive accord , which hinges on both sides coming to an agreement on the timing of sanctions relief			1
the @entity17 administration moved on two fronts today to advance its nuclear diplomacy with @entity3 , with talks between top @entity1 and @entity3 diplomats at a @entity23 conference in @entity24 and an aggressive effort to sell the emerging deal to skeptical @entity1 lawmakers and constituencies in @entity29			1

@entity0 and @entity2 met today at the @entity23 on the sidelines of a conference on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in which both men are participating for the first time since a framework agreement was reached earlier this month @entity0 and @entity2 reconvened at the @entity43 home of @entity3 's ambassador to the @entity23 today after their marathon negotiations in @entity35 with several questions outstanding			1
@entity0 is pictured here today giving remarks at the @entity23 nuclear proliferation conference in @entity24 in the nation 's capitol , lead @entity1 negotiator @entity49 told a conference of reform jews that diplomatic collapse would leave @entity3 perilously close to nuclear weapons capacity			1
energy secretary @entity56 said a final agreement would in some ways be tougher than what the @entity1 has outlined thus far			1
all the activity was taking place as the @entity62 begins debate over empowering @entity64 to review and possibly reject any nuclear pact			0
@entity67 presidential candidates are lining up to oppose any deal with a government the @entity1 considers the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism and to show their support for @entity74			1
@entity75 of @entity76 wants to require @entity3 's leaders to publicly accept @entity74 's right to exist , a nearly impossible mandate			2
@entity80 of @entity81 hopes to put the onus on advocates to win congressional approval of a deal , and not on opponents to gather enough votes for rejection			0
but even as the legislation moves forward , house speaker @entity90 privately acknowledged to a gathering of the @entity93 over the weekend that his party does n't command enough votes to override a presidential veto of any resolution disapproving of an @entity3 deal , @entity89 reported			1
@entity90 's spokesman , @entity99 , did n't dispute the report			2
' obviously , it takes only a fraction of the @entity104 and @entity62 @entity103 to sustain a veto , but it is impossible to say whether they will or not until we know what the final ' deal ' looks like , ' @entity99 told the @entity111			0
president @entity17 is pictured here showing @entity113 prime minister @entity112 the @entity114 on the @entity115 today			0
his administration moved on two fronts today to advance its nuclear diplomacy with @entity3 , with talks between top @entity1 and @entity3 diplomats at the @entity23 conference in @entity24 and an aggressive effort to sell the emerging deal to skeptical @entity1 lawmakers and constituencies in @entity29 prime minister @entity112 is in the nation 's capital to discuss a range of economic , security , and global issues , including progress on the @entity133 , @entity113 's expanding role in the @entity135 , and climate change			1
the two national leaders are pictured here from behind , still at the @entity114 , facing the @entity140 @entity0 and @entity2 reconvened at the @entity43 home of @entity3 's ambassador to the @entity23 today after their marathon negotiations in @entity35 with several questions outstanding			2
particularly problematic for president @entity17 and his team are how quickly sanctions would be eased for @entity147 in exchange for nuclear concessions , and how to snap economic restrictions back into place quickly if @entity3 is caught cheating			1
at a breakfast meeting with journalists , @entity56 , a former @entity154 physics department head , provided some new detail on the combination of technical limits that the @entity1 says would keep @entity3 at least a year away from assembling enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon for at least a decade			1
hours after the framework was announced , the @entity1 said @entity3 would be permitted to keep 6,104 centrifuges installed			2
of these , a little more than 1,000 could be kept at @entity3 's deeply buried facility at @entity163 that may be impervious to @entity1 or @entity74 air attack			1
none of those would be permitted to enrich uranium , material that can be used in a nuclear warhead			0
@entity56 said no advanced centrifuges can be installed or developed at that site for 15 years			0
and in a new twist , he said only one - third of the 1,000 centrifuges there can actually ' spin ' over that period			0
the rest will be ' just sitting there , ' he said			0
the details are significant because they provide another piece of how @entity1 officials calculate that they 'd have enough time to detect any @entity3 push toward a bomb and respond			2
@entity147 says its program is solely designed for energy , medical and research purposes , but @entity29 and many other governments distrust @entity3 's motives			1
@entity191 chairman @entity190 , center , and the committee 's ranking member @entity193 , are seen here speaking to reporters on @entity196 in @entity29 on the day their bill empowering @entity64 to review and potentially reject any @entity3 nuclear deal won approval of the panel			1
they must now win a battle in the full @entity62 with some colleagues determined to change the legislation in ways that could sink it nowhere does skepticism seem higher than on @entity196 , where lawmakers are wrestling with how tough to make legislation on @entity3 that has gained the tacit approval of @entity17			2
proponents of the bill are trying to discourage any changes to the legislation			0
they recognize that politically driven amendments could undermine @entity103 support and sink the carefully crafted measure			0
' anybody who monkeys with this bill is going to run into a buzz saw , ' @entity217 sen. @entity217 of @entity218 , a possible @entity104 candidate , warned ahead of this week 's debate			0
@entity223 , the @entity224 's undersecretary for political affairs , said if talks fail to produce a final deal , @entity3 would be two to three months from being able to produce enough material for a weapon			1
speaking to the @entity231 in @entity29 , she said the president would reconsider support for the bill if it is distorted by amendments			0
' there will be a lot of pretty awful amendments , quite frankly , and we 'll see where we end up , ' @entity223 said			0
the bill was approved 19 - 0 by the @entity191			0
it has 62 co-sponsors from both parties			0
the legislation would block @entity17 from waiving congressional sanctions for at least 30 days while lawmakers weigh in			0
and it would stipulate that if senators disapprove the deal , @entity17 would lose authority to waive certain economic penalties â€” an event that would certainly prompt a presidential veto			2
among proposed additions to the bill are demands that @entity3 release any @entity1 citizens it is holding and refrain from any cooperation with nuclear - armed @entity257			2
another insists that any agreement be treated as an international treaty , requiring two - thirds ratification by the @entity62			0
another set of amendments would block any sanctions relief for @entity3 until it meets goals the @entity1 set years ago as negotiating stances and has long since abandoned			1
the bill must receive 66 votes in the @entity62			0

it was their first meeting since world powers and @entity3 sealed a framework deal on april 2 that would limit @entity3 's ability to build a nuclear weapon
final agreement hinges timing of sanctions relief - something both sides have said they wo n't budge on
@entity17 administration is also engaged in an aggressive effort to sell the emerging deal to skeptical lawmakers and constituencies in @entity29
@entity67 presidential candidates are lining up to oppose any deal with a government the @entity1 considers the leading state sponsor of terrorism
house speaker @entity90 has acknowledged that his party does n't command enough votes to override a veto of any resolution , though
