the bizarre - looking cars have been designed and built by student teams from 24 countries as part of the @entity12 2013 , which came to a close in @entity14 today			1
the event challenges the students to make the most energy efficient cars , through using conventional fuels such as petrol , diesel , ethanol and @entity24 fuel , as well as alternatives such as hydrogen and electricity			1
thousands of students from across @entity29 took part in the @entity31 in @entity32 , which finished today			2
pictured is @entity34 , a prototype running on an electric battery , competing for the @entity37 the challenge sees students compete to see who can drive the furthest on the equivalent of 1 kwh or 1 litre of fuel the @entity44 4 , in the @entity46 category , running on diesel , competing for team @entity44 from the @entity48 , in @entity49 results are measured on who can drive the furthest on the equivalent of 1 kwh or 1 litre of fuel			1
this year 's event saw winners from nine countries scooping the prizes , while no less than five new records have been set			1
@entity57 , chief executive of @entity58 , said : ' it 's always inspiring to see the leaders and engineers of the future put their bright and creative ideas into action			0
' this year 's @entity12 again showcased new innovations and promising creative technologies			0
' we are looking back at a successful event which attracted over 50,000 visitors and 3,000 students from the @entity71 and beyond to support the teams and visit @entity73 ' i found it encouraging to see so many people enjoying the attractions around innovation and the future of energy			2
' the @entity82 prototype , running on gasoline , competing for team @entity84 from @entity86 , @entity87 this year 's event saw winners from nine countries scooping the prizes , while no less than five new records have been set the @entity91 , in the @entity46 category , running on hydrogen , competing for team @entity94 from @entity94 , @entity87 in the @entity46 category , team @entity94 from @entity87 achieved a new record with 145.7 km per kwh in the battery electric fuel class - an improvement of 41.7 km per kwh from last year ; while @entity49 team @entity99 from @entity98 improved on a record with 315.4 km / l. @entity94 ’ team leader said : ' we ’ll definitely come back next year to improve this year ’s record			1
