@entity6 , from @entity7 , was used to spending her entire day in darkness , until she realised that bursting into song could relieve her of the condition			1
the 66 - year - old suffers from focal dystonia - a rare muscle complaint which causes her eye lids to spasm shut			1
scroll down to see amazing video of @entity17 ... @entity6 has a painful eye condition which causes her eyes to close against her will			1
she used to spend her entire day in darkness until she realised bursting into song could relieve her of the condition mrs @entity6 said : ' my eyes used to get incredibly red and inflamed and were always itchy and sore			1
' then i began to realise that my eye lids would just involuntary close			1
there was no way i could move them - apart from prising them open with my fingers			1
i had to give up my job as a careers advisor , i could n’t drive			0
but then one day at my local choir practice , i was singing my heart out and all of a sudden i realised i could see the conductor			2
my eyes were open ! focal dystonia is a neurological condition which affects the muscles around the eyes , causing muscle spasms that make them close , twitch and blink			1
mrs @entity6 now walks with the aid of a stick and wears dark glasses and a visor			1
she said : ' it all started off with extreme light sensitivity			0
i did n’t question it at first but then my eyes started to get really sore and dry			2
' i went to an optician and they thought i had inflammation of the eyes , but any medication i was given just made no difference			1
mrs @entity6 suffers from focal dystonia , a rare muscle complaint which causes her eye lids to spasm shut			1
the only way she can see is by prising them open - or singing ' it was hard because i ’d explain to my doctor what was happening but he had no idea what it was			1
i had so many referrals and appointments			0
' except for when i ’m singing i almost feel like i ’ve got sand in my eyes every minute of the day			1
they ’re gritty and dry all the time			0
' they do n’t open properly but they do n’t close properly either so that adds to pain			2
' various over-the - counter remedies have failed to work			2
mrs @entity6 also has @entity78 injections every 10 weeks to relax the muscles around her eyes , but the success is variable			1
thanks to her remarkable discovery , mrs @entity6 says she has a new lease of life			2
' singing just lets me forget about my problems and recharge my batteries for a bit , ' she said			2
' i suppose it is quite unusual			0
as soon as we stop singing and there ’s the piano accompaniment or the introduction of the song my eyes are closed			2
and then as soon as i start singing , they open again			2
it 's thought that activities such as singing can act as a distraction , causing the symptoms of dystonia to disappear temporarily ' there seems to be something to do with music that forms a connection with me			1
i feel an incredible bond to it			0
i even find myself singing all the time now just to get a bit of relief			0
' focal dystonia is just one type of the condition which affects at least 70,000 children and adults in the @entity118			1
@entity119 , chief executive of the @entity120 said : ' dystonia is a neurological condition where incorrect messages from the brain cause muscles to become over-active			0
' it can affect many different parts of the body - and causes disabling and often painful postures or movements			0
' for reasons that are not fully understood , shifts in attention can sometimes cause the symptoms to disappear temporarily			0
this can lead to people affected by dystonia finding relief in unexpected ways			0
' other examples we ’ve been told about include being able to shout at the dog but not talk properly , being able to dance fine but not put the foot down flat normally , and being able to run for the washing when it ’s raining , but find it extremely painful to walk			0
' unfortunately , the symptoms tend to reappear as soon as the activity causing the distraction finishes			0
' @entity6 now hopes to set up a support group in @entity150 to help others affected by the condition			2
thanks to her new found love of singing , @entity6 has even got her family and friends to get involved in belting out a song or two			1
' my family are so proud of me and they see how happy singing makes me			0
i even managed to get my husband , @entity163 , to join the choir			0
' the other day my grandson wanted to see my eyes			0
so i sang a little song and they popped open			0
it ’s marvellous ! for more information on dystonia visit the @entity120 website at @entity173			0
