you might think they ’d be slightly chillier – but children born from frozen embryos turn out to be warmer and more sociable			1
a study found that boys and girls born through @entity7 were just as chatty and independent as those whose mothers conceived naturally			1
however , when the @entity7 children were divided into two groups , there was a clear difference			2
those created from embryos that were frozen before use were more sociable than those used when still ‘ fresh ’			2
children born from frozen embryos are more sociable , chatty and independent than those born from embryos used when still ' fresh ' , a study found normally in @entity7 , the embryos thought to have the best chance of making a woman pregnant are used in treatment just a few days after they are made in a dish			1
any that are left over can be frozen to allow her to try again if the treatment is n’t successful or if she wants to add to her family in a few years ’ time			0
one in every 50 babies born in @entity30 is the result of @entity7 – and many of those will have started out as frozen embryos			1
dr @entity34 , a @entity35 fertility expert , said it is n’t clear what ’s behind the phenomenon			0
however , it may be that only the strongest embryos survive being frozen for several months before being thawed			1
@entity41 , an @entity42 ivf doctor , said it is possible the delay caused by freezing gives the woman ’s body - including the delicate lining of her womb - time to recover from the powerful drugs given at the start of @entity7 treatment to boost egg production			0
another possibility is that given that fresh embryos are normally used first and the frozen ones later , the ‘ ice babies ’ will be younger siblings			2
younger brothers and sisters are often more laid back and more sociable than the more responsible eldest child			1
normally in @entity7 , ' fresh ' embryos thought to have the best chance of making a woman pregnant			2
researchers hope the finding will allay fears that children born from frozen embryos ( pictured above ) are somehow inferior professor @entity66 , a consultant gynaecologist at @entity67 , said studies have suggested @entity7 babies are more sociable as adults			1
this may be because they tend to be born to older parent and so spend more time in adult company from a young age			0
he was sceptical that the finding is due to birth order			0
he said : ‘ in my experience , when the first child was born from a fresh embryo and the second from a frozen one , the second child tends to be less socially integrated and a bit more stroppy			0
’ researcher @entity85 , of @entity87 in @entity88 , studied 250 kindergarten - age children			0
she hopes the finding will allay fears that children born from frozen embryos are somehow inferior			1
she presented her research at the @entity96 ’s annual conference in @entity97 .			0

@entity7 children were just as chatty and independent as those born naturally
children created from frozen embryos were more sociable , experts found
this was compared with children born from embryos used still ' fresh '
it *'s* thought fresh embryos give a woman the best chance of having a baby
may be because only the strongest embryos survive being frozen
could be because children from frozen embryos tend to be the second child
younger children tend to be more laid back and sociable than the first child
