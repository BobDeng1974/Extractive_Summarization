if you 're an @entity3 customer in the @entity4 your future online purchases could arrive at your home or office by drone			1
frustrated with how long it is taking to get approval for its flying delivery service in the @entity11 , @entity3 is said to have approached the @entity12 to launch a trial of the technology in @entity4			1
transport minister @entity15 revealed the plans at a press conference for driverless cars and wider technologies earlier today			1
@entity3 has approached the @entity12 about trialling its flying @entity20 in the @entity4 , transport minister @entity15 has confirmed			1
one of its prototype delivery drones is pictured ‘ i had some people from @entity3 coming to see me the other day ; they want to replace van deliveries with drone deliveries , and they ca n’t do any trials in the @entity11 because they ’re over-regulated , ’ he said			1
‘ so my favourite word is deregulation , and we need to make sure that wherever you are in the world , and if you want to innovate and you want to invest in this sort of technology , come to the @entity4 because we ’re here to help you			1
' the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) in the @entity11 last week approved @entity3 ’s plan to begin testing drones for online deliveries , though the e-commerce firm first made the request in july last year			1
but in the time it took to approve the use of its first - generation drone , @entity3 has developed a new version , which makes the ruling ' obsolete '			1
so the firm is setting its sights on foreign markets			0
the project , called @entity20 , was first revealed in a @entity53 video in late 2013			2
the company is developing drones that can fly at speeds of 50 miles per hour ( 80 kph ) , operate autonomously and sense and avoid objects			0
@entity3 ’s @entity59 wrote in a letter to the @entity35 in december : ‘ without approval of our testing in the @entity11 , we will be forced to continue expanding our @entity65 footprint abroad			1
’ under @entity11 law , operating drones for commercial purposes is illegal , however it is allowed in the @entity4 if permission is granted by the @entity71 ( @entity71 )			1
the @entity35 is said to be currently reviewing its rules on drones , with new regulations expected to be announced in the near future			0
@entity3 is developing aerial vehicles as part of @entity20			1
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds ( 2kg )			0
about 86 per cent of @entity3 's deliveries are five lbs or less , the company said			1
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making @entity20 available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' @entity3 has said			1
in the @entity11 , the flying of unmanned aircraft , including recreational drones , is banned above 400ft ( 122m )			0
any flight that takes place within five miles ( 8km ) of an airport can also only occur once air traffic control has been notified			0
the @entity4 ’s @entity71 has laid out guidelines for drone users that specify that unmanned aircraft must always be flown within the ‘ line of sight ’ of the pilot , which it generally measures at 1,600ft ( 488m ) horizontally and 400ft ( 122m ) vertically			2
this remains a stumbling block for @entity3 and other companies as it means they would only be able to deliver items within 1,600ft ( 488m ) of their warehouses			2
so far , law enforcement of drone regulation breaches in the @entity4 appear to have been relatively tolerant			2
chief inspector @entity106 , of the @entity107 , told a @entity108 select committee on piloted aircraft systems that tourists had been caught flying drones in parts of central @entity114 , despite laws restricting use close to buildings and congested areas			2
‘ we have decided not to enforce the legislation that exists , even though they were in contravention of it , because it did not seem proportionate , ’ he said			0
@entity125 internet giant @entity124 is also currently carrying out its own private trials of drone technology for deliveries			0
a new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones			0
' @entity135 is the first site in the @entity4 to introduce the vast benefits which the drone industry will inevitably bring , ' says @entity139 , its managing director			2
' in fact the service is intended to benefit the public , the drone industry and the @entity12			0
' our hope is that in allowing the public to request that their property become a no fly zone , then this will address the privacy concerns which have been mooted by the relevant authorities			0
' a new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones			0
an example of a map marking such zones is shown the company will monitor and record drone traffic so its service can provide a ' rapid drone intercept solution ' to prevent hostile incidents such as a terrorist attack			0
mr @entity139 , who has previously served in @entity166 and in the @entity107 , believes the service will allow the @entity168 ( @entity168 ) industry to establish itself in the @entity4			2
' as our database grows , it will help services such a @entity3 ’s @entity20 , @entity171 ’s drone delivery service and @entity173 ’s @entity172 among others realistically get a foothold in the @entity4 while simultaneously addressing current security and privacy concerns , ' he added			1
@entity135 will be able to monitor and track all drone , @entity168 , @entity182 ( @entity182 ) and @entity168 ( @entity168 ) flights and share this information with the public .			0

transport minister @entity15 confirmed @entity3 asked for the trial
he seemed to *encourage* the trials and innovation in @entity4
@entity192 was first unveiled in 2013 with the idea that parcels could be delivered to remote areas by drones reaching 50mph ( *80km/h* )
