by @entity0 television reality shows normally pulsate with optimism			1
participants greet one another with air kisses and whoops of delight			1
they look ahead to fame and riches			1
that 's reality tv , right ? not quite			1
not in the case of a new @entity14 series called my last summer			1
its participants hobble and weep			1
not for them the possibility of years on the hello ! magazine circuit and chat shows			2
for all these people are - or were - terminally ill. all the participants from my last summer suffer from a terminal illness , left - right : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 they decided to talk about their shared predicament in front of the cameras and the result is powerful , emotionally draining television			1
it may also help us as a society to be a little less distant about death , something i wish i had known earlier			2
the five sorry souls who took part , three of whom have died before the series starts next wednesday , were taken to a manor house in @entity52			1
the opening programme shows the uneasy bonhomie , soon followed by sobbing tears and bursts of bleak anger , as they welcome one another to this most unwelcome of clubs			2
breast - cancer sufferer @entity29 , 58 , has a penchant for wine , laughter and lipstick			2
at first encounter she 's irrepressible , determinedly insisting that she will keep her head held high			1
@entity28 seems to be the opposite			2
he was told at 41 that he had leukaemia			2
he nearly overcame the illness , then he developed lung complications which , inescapably , will kill him			2
@entity28 has a family and money worries ( shortly before his diagnosis he stopped paying into a crucial insurance policy )			2
he walks through the gardens and stoically wonders if he 'll be buried there			2
folksy mother of four @entity31 , whose motor neurone disease is expected to kill her within a year , is just 38			2
her youngest daughter , who 's six , will not utter the word ' dead '			1
instead she says ' chocolate '			2
' when you 're ... chocolate ... can i have your phone ? ' she asks her darling mum			2
somehow , @entity31 manages to laugh at this innocent question			2
i 'm afraid it made me bawl			1
' @entity31 's , daughter will not utter the word ' dead '			1
instead she says ' chocolate '			2
" when you 're ... chocolate ... can i have your phone ? " she asks her darling mum			2
i 'm afraid it made me bawl ' former disc jockey @entity32 , 48 , was once a dude , quite the @entity32 about town ( he had 11 children by ten women )			1
that was before he learned he had prostate cancer			2
@entity32 is now struggling to contain his despair			2
he is supported by his girlfriend of 16 months , 46 - year - old @entity103 , a woman of eloquence and beauty			1
we see them having a searingly upsetting row			0
' i just want to give up , ' says @entity32 , who is in terrible pain			0
' i ai n't got the fight in me			0
' @entity103 leaves the car in fury , her saintly patience fraying - and who can blame her ? is terminal illness not sometimes as hard for those who watch their loved ones dying ? i suppose there could be an argument that the cameras should have been turned off - as @entity103 at one point requests			0
yet there is public value in the insights we gain			0
junior is now in a better place but the grieving @entity103 has done a noble thing in baring her emotions so that we may understand better the maelstrom people in her position must endure			1
finally we meet @entity30 , 57			0
he 's a former ferry worker who says he 's smoked himself to an early death			1
@entity135 , he hopes his fate will alert others not only to the dangers of cigarettes but also to the needs of terminally ill people to be allowed some normality			1
' i 'm not dying of cancer , ' he told me - shortly before he died			0
' i 'm living with cancer			0
' @entity30 may look the least healthy of the five but appearances can be misleading			0
we soon see how the amazingly chirpy @entity29 is at the end of her thread			0
quentin with his father @entity151 in 2004			1
@entity151 was also diagnosed with terminal cancer she breaks down as she discloses that her husband of 25 years could n't cope with her illness			0
on the day she was going for her test results , he reportedly sat in his chair and said , ' i 've just made a tomato sandwich ' and let her go to the doctor alone			1
when she returned with the news that she was terminally ill , he allegedly said , ' oh ' , and left the room			1
@entity29 adds , ' if you ca n't talk to your family and friends about it , who can you talk to ? ' gosh , that question hurt			0
you see , my dear , quiet , undemonstrative father went through a terminal illness before his death at 82 four years ago			1
he refused the treatments that might have given him a couple more months			1
he faced the demon death with the greatest dignity			0
watching my last summer forced me to revisit that time - a period , for our family , of heightened memories , an exhausting time when all other life seemed suspended - and i saw how i could have done better			1
what did this series do to me ? i nearly write that it shamed me , but perhaps it is truer to say that it showed me , too late , how i might have behaved in a different way			1
@entity191 was diagnosed with terminal cancer one november afternoon			0
i was on a train when my mobile rang and one of my sisters gave me the news			0
i hastened to my parents ' house and found my mother on the phone and my father reading the paper			1
' oh , hullo , ' he said , as though it was any normal day			0
' your mother should n't be long			0
' should n't be long			0
to this day the words toll in my mind			0
should i have flown to his arms and given him a hug ? he was not that sort of father			1
yet maybe he would have liked it			0
the participants in my last summer say it 's a relief to meet people in the same boat			1
at last they find they do n't have to explain all the time how they 're feeling			0
@entity29 talks of being momentarily ' free from people who just do n't know what to say '			1
' watching my last summer forced me to revisit that time - a period , for our family , of heightened memories , an exhausting time when all other life seemed suspended - and i saw how i could have done better ' @entity29 says her husband went through ' @entity234 ' syndrome - poor little old me ' - and dwelt on his own misfortune at being left behind			1
it may have been more complicated than that - somewhere out there he will be nursing his grief			0
but @entity29 's words do illustrate the loneliness of the terminally ill and the way that they 're denied so much normality			1
@entity31 voices a worry that will , i suspect , make viewers gasp with tears			0
she knows that her husband @entity248 will never be able to play the mumsy role for their girls			0
' daddy 's not going to be able to plait their hair or give them motherly chats about periods , ' she says with the anguish of knowing another woman will bring up her daughters , yet ' not knowing who they are now			1
you do n't know if they 're going to do it right			0
if they 're going to love them right			0
i want to choose them now			0
but @entity248 will have a fit ! ' my father and i had never had a chatty relationship but i wish , in those final months , i 'd assured him he had been a fine father			1
i wish i 'd told him how much i respected him			0
i regret that i allowed my @entity273 reserve to trump the imperatives of love			0
my mother assures me he knew we all loved him and i 'm reasonably sure she 's right			1
even so , i would now feel more complete if i had described to him the depth of my regard			0
' look , ' said @entity30 , as we finished our conversation , ' i 've had a bloody good life			0
i do n't mind sharing the end of it			0
' thank you , @entity30 , and all who took part in my last summer			0
it may be hard watching for those who have lost loved ones to terminal illness but like the best tragic drama , it leaves you with a sense of catharsis and of understanding better this vale of tears we call life , not least when we know it must soon end			0
