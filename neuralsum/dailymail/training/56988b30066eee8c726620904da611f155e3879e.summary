by @entity0 the deputy leader of a council has been suspended after sending messages to a radio station pretending to be different people – so he could praise his own authority			1
@entity7 used names including @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 as he sent in texts during debates on @entity14 backing @entity15 and criticising the opposition			1
in messages sent in to the breakfast show with @entity19 and @entity20 , the @entity21 councillor of 11 years also pretended to be from different areas of @entity23 including @entity24 and @entity25			1
' hi , i 'm @entity10 ' : ( aka @entity7 ) ' hi , i 'm @entity11 ' : ( aka @entity7 ) ' hi , i 'm @entity9 ' : ( aka @entity7 ) but after six months , @entity14 staff eventually became suspicious after they spotted that the messages - around 16 of them - were coming from the same mobile number under names such as @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
mr @entity7 , who will now face a council standards board hearing , has since admitted sending the texts and apologised ‘ fully ’ for his actions			1

’ @entity7 will now face a standards board hearing at the @entity15 headquarters , pictured mr @entity7 was not at a meeting of the council 's cabinet held on thursday night but the council 's leader @entity75 has taken on his cabinet responsibilities			1
