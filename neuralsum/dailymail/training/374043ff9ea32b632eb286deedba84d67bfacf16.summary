@entity0 promised to take nothing for granted after opening an enormous six - shot lead with another brilliant performance at @entity4			1
the @entity5 shot a third - round 68 at @entity7 and is closing in on a momentous piece of @entity10 golf history			1
victory today would make him the first @entity10 to win three different majors since the @entity14 was founded in 1934 — and at the age of just 25			1
even legends such as sir @entity17 and @entity18 won only two of the four			2
only one man in the long history of majors has ever lost such a big final round and that was @entity32 to @entity17 at the masters in 1996			0
but @entity0 said : ‘ i wo n’t be taking anything for granted			1
i came back from seven shots with a round to go to win the @entity37 at @entity38 in may so i know it can be done			2
‘ i ’ve got to make sure i do n’t get ahead of myself and keep the big numbers off my card			0
‘ a lot can happen — i ’ve been on the right side of it and the wrong side of it , that ’s why you ca n’t let yourself think about winning , you ’ve just got to stay completely in the present			2
‘ that ’s what i ’m going to try to do for all 18 holes tomorrow			0
you have to think about how you ’re going to control your emotions and focus on what you need to do			0
’ winning combination : @entity54 ( left ) could bank £ 50,000 should @entity55 this year @entity0 , who began with a four - shot lead , was caught by @entity58 @entity57 at the 13th , but an amazing finish to his round saw him muster two eagles in his last three holes to open up his sizeable advantage			1
he received a rapturous reception from the 7,000 fans packed into the grandstands at the 18th and the thousands more who had followed him on every hole			0
‘ it ’s just a pleasure to play in front of people who give you so much support and i hope i can give them something to cheer tomorrow , ’ he said			0
@entity0 ’s father @entity54 should also be in the money today , for he is in line to claim on a bet he made a decade ago , when he placed £ 100 on his son winning @entity4 by the age of 26 — at odds of 500 - 1 .			1

@entity0 leads by six shots after day three of @entity4 at @entity7
his father @entity54 put £ 100 at 500/1 on @entity0 winning @entity4 by age of 26
