by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 01:44 est , 11 september 2012 new @entity2 enforcer @entity1 has leapt to the defence of health minister @entity4 after backbenchers warned she was a ' train wreck waiting to happen '			1
ms @entity4 , promoted into government by @entity8 last week after less than two and half years as an mp , sparked a storm after branding the law on assisted suicide ' ridiculous '			1
she demanded greater ' honesty ' about whether or not prosecutions would be brought against people who help relatives to die			2
@entity4 was appointed health minister in @entity8 's reshuffle but angered @entity2 mps with remarks on assisted suicide her comments were publicly criticised by a number of @entity2 mps			1
@entity25 said ms @entity4 ' displayed a profound ignorance of the vulnerable position many of the disabled , elderly and chronically sick would find themselves in should she get her way '			1
@entity30 warned of ‘ an almighty parliamentary row ’ if attempts were made to change the law			2
now furious backbenchers have demanded mr @entity1 , the new chief whip , rein ms @entity4 in			1
one @entity2 mp told him : ‘ she is a train wreck waiting to happen			0
' the mp added later : ' just a nightmare			0
i do n’t know what the @entity38 was thinking			0
’ a second mp said : ‘ we have been told to bite our tongues but she is making the government look ridiculous			0
' however it is understood mr @entity1 has rebuffed the rebels , telling them to give ms @entity4 ' a break and time to find her feet '			1
new chief whip @entity1 has told angry backbenchers to give @entity4 ' a break ' mr @entity1 - nicknamed ' @entity50 ' - was promoted from international development secretary to take charge of the @entity53 , at a time when @entity2 backbenchers are increasingly willing to rebel			1
the row illustrates the major headache caused by mr @entity8 ’s first unforced reshuffle since becoming prime minister in 2010			0
@entity2 mps elected in 2005 are furious at being overlooked for promotion , while ms @entity4 was among several who entered the @entity64 in 2010 to join ministerial ranks			1
the former barrister was one of six @entity2 women to join the government in response to complaints that mr @entity8 is failing to connect with female voters			0
@entity72 hope her no - nonsense style , honed as a presenter on @entity76 's @entity75 in the 1980s , will resonate with the electorate			0
but the furore triggered by her remarks on assisted suicide over-shadowed ministers today unveiling a new £ 1.5m suicide prevention strategy			1
ms @entity4 said in an interview at the weekend : ' i think it ’s ridiculous and appalling that people have to go abroad to end their life instead of being able to end their life at home			1
' the rules that we have about who we do n’t prosecute allow things to happen but there ’s a good argument that we should be a bit more honest about it			0
' asked about ms @entity4 ’s comments , @entity72 today hinted that @entity99 could look again at the issue			1
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ there has obviously been some debate over the last week and the @entity106 family case has raised some very profound moral and ethical issues			2
‘ i think there are very strong arguments on both sides of the debate and it ’s an issue that no doubt will be debated further			2
it ’s an issue for @entity99 to decide , it ’s an issue of conscience too			0
' this is one of those issues which is likely to be subject to further debate in the coming weeks and months			2
' it comes after locked - in syndrome sufferer @entity121 died a week after he lost his legal bid to end his life with a doctor ’s help			0
@entity121 , a sufferer of locked - in syndrome , died a week after losing his legal battle to end his life with help from doctors his widow , @entity132 , has said she would continue his fight to win a landmark ruling for the legal right to die			0
mrs @entity136 , whose lawyers say she has a ' compelling ' case to be allowed to continue her husband 's legal fight , welcomed ms @entity4 's willingness to ' stick her neck out ' but said rights should not be restricted to the dying			1
since new guidelines for prosecutors in assisted suicide cases were brought in in february 2010 , anyone acting with compassion to help end the life of someone who has decided they can not go on is unlikely to face criminal charges			2
@entity154 , the @entity154 minister at the @entity155 , today backed reform of the law on assisted dying , while stressing that it is not something the government has policy on			0
he told @entity164 's today programme : ' i think there is a case for a debate			2
' that 's my personal view , it 's nothing to do with my position as a minister in the @entity155			0

chief whip says @entity4 must ' find her feet '
