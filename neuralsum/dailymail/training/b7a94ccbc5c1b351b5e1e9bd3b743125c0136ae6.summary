@entity1 can make your lungs look younger - and could even help fight tuberculosis , researchers have found			1
new research shows that the lungs become more inflammatory with age			2
however , an @entity9 team found that ibuprofen can lower that inflammation			2
researchers say that @entity1 can make your lungs look younger - and could even help fight tuberculosis			1
the researchers gave old and young mice ibuprofen in their food for two weeks and then examined their lung cells			1
old mice in the study were 18 months old – equivalent to about 65 in human years – and young mice were 3 months old , a similar age to human young adults			1
after this diet modification , several pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of old mice had been reduced to levels identical to those in the lungs of young mice , and the macrophages in old mouse lungs were no longer in a primed state			1
in fact , immune cells from old mouse lungs fought tuberculosis bacteria as effectively as cells from young mice after lung inflammation was reduced by ibuprofen			1
the ibuprofen had no effect on the immune response to @entity47 in young mice			1
' very few researchers have linked inflammation to infectious disease in old age , even though @entity47 in particular will drive that inflammation even further , ' said @entity53 , associate professor of microbial infection and immunityat @entity54 and senior author of the study			2
' the inflammation - associated changes that we saw in the lung were a small finding , but an important finding because the implications are great , ' @entity53 said			0
' we should be able to modify the environment in the lung			0
' if we can reverse the inflammatory environment in a very straightforward way , that is a positive			0
' the research is published in the @entity70			0
though this line of work might someday support the use of ibuprofen as an adjunct therapy for elderly people with @entity47 , researchers said they are not recommending use of the drug for the purposes of lowering inflammation			2
' you can actually reduce your inflammation as you age by being lean , eating well and exercising			0
and we know that in the elderly , people who are fitter live longer , ' she said			0
' inflammation is associated with sickness and frailty			0
' though the research was conducted in mice , @entity53 co-led a previous study indicating that both mouse and human lungs develop the same profile of pro-inflammatory proteins and fatty molecules with age , creating an environment that impairs the immune response to infection			0
' essentially , ibuprofen made the lungs of old mice look young , @entity53 said			2
researchers said they are not yet recommending use of the drug for the purposes of lowering inflammation ' putting young mice on ibuprofen had no effect because they had no lung inflammation , which implies the ibuprofen reduced the inflammation and changed the immune response in the old mice , ' @entity53 said			1
' it might be that ibuprofen works on specific pathways to lower inflammation , and that might help with control of @entity47			1
' more than 9 million people worldwide are estimated to have active tb infections , and about 1.4 million people die of tuberculosis each year			0
the researchers gave old and young mice ibuprofen in their food for two weeks and then examined their lung cells			1
after this diet modification , several pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of old mice had been reduced to levels identical to those in the lungs of young mice , and the macrophages in old mouse lungs were no longer in a primed state			2
most previous research establishing inflammation 's links to aging and disease has tested blood for elevated proteins that signal an inflammatory environment			0
these researchers found the same proteins in the lungs of old mice			1
research has already established that the inevitable inflammation that comes with aging is linked to such conditions as type 2 diabetes and heart disease			0
@entity53 and colleagues have extended the work to test whether ibuprofen affects the elderly mouse immune response to @entity47 infection .			0

researchers found lungs become more inflammatory with age
@entity1 can lower that inflammation
old mice on ibuprofen were able to fight the disease like young mice
