by @entity0 the president of the @entity2 , @entity3 , said some students are better off with a trade school leavers should consider going into trades rather than university as a deregulated fee system threatens to almost double the cost of a degree			1
that 's the view of @entity2 president @entity3 , who said there are ' too many people ' already enrolled in universities in @entity17 and more should learn skills for the workforce			1
universities will set their own fees from 2016 , making tertiary education unaffordable for some			1
prof @entity24 said the introduction of deregulated system could see more people undertake vocational education training as they weigh up the benefits and costs of various types of education			1
' i would say there are too many people going to university and not enough going through the @entity39 system , ' ms @entity3 told the @entity40			2
' i just think some students would be better off with vocation and skill training and having work experience			2
' vocational education trade providers such as @entity46 could offer substantial benefits to some school leavers her comments , made before a @entity52 universities meeting at the @entity53 last week , come after education experts predicted back in june that the @entity56 's changes to higher education could force the cost of degrees to increase to more than $ 120,000			2
the high cost of education could deter people from furthering their studies at university and some have predicted loan repayments will almost double from $ 6.6 billion this year to $ 12 billion in 2018			0
the @entity67 has modeled its own dire forecast for tertiary graduates , claiming that 65,000 people , or 30 per cent of graduates , will be without a job four months after finishing their studies in 2016			0
@entity52 universities chairman @entity73 told the @entity53 last that many elite universities , such as his own @entity75 , would probably enrol fewer students under a deregulated fee system			0
the @entity78 could be one of @entity17 's leading institutions which set their own fees from 2016 he added that a decline in enrolments would allow them more personalised learning experience for students at research universities , and would free - up positions for high - achieving students and academics to attend regional and suburban universities			1
@entity17 's leading research universities typically enrol up to two thirds the number of @entity97 universities , because under a capped fee system universities need student numbers to subsidise research programs			1
institutions such as @entity75 , @entity103 and @entity104 , can enrol up to 50,000 students whereas @entity106 , in the @entity97 , enrol just 15,000			0
education minister @entity107 has justified fee deregulation by pointing out there will still be benefits to having a degree			0
he said graduates will be earning about 75 per cent more than non-graduates - or about $ 1 million more over their lifetimes , but @entity116 higher education spokeswoman @entity114 disagrees			0
she said : ' it beggars belief the government would introduce these changes when their own department 's figures show fewer graduates will be employed			0

business *council* president said more people should consider a trade
@entity3 believes they would be better - off with work experience programs
she believes too many people are enrolled in universities
a deregulation system would help people weigh - up education prospects
in 2016 @entity17 universities will be able to charge their own fees
