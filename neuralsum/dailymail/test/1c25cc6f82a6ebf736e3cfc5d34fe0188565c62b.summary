president @entity0 has ordered the release of 22 drug dealers - including eight who were serving life sentences			1
nearly all of the offenders who @entity0 granted clemency to were convicted of dealing addictive , hard drugs like crack cocaine , methamphetamine and heroin			1
eight of those whose sentences were commuted - an act the @entity16 said continues @entity0 's push to make the justice system fairer - were serving terms of life in prison			1
the effort is aimed at reducing harsh sentences for those who faced outdated guidelines at their time of sentencing and would be serving shorter punishments had they been convicted today			1
@entity0 has granted clemency to 22 drug offenders who were sentenced under outdated guidelines in december , mr @entity0 issued his first round of commutations under new guidelines that were put in place to cut costs by reducing the growing prison population and grant leniency to nonviolent drug offenders sentenced to years long terms of confinement away from society			1
a commutation leaves the conviction in place and ends the punishment			2
@entity46 , the @entity16 counsel , said many of the 22 people whose federal sentences will be cut short by mr @entity0 's action would already have served their time and paid the debt they owed society had they been sentenced under current laws and policies			1
' because many were convicted under an outdated sentencing regime , they served years - in some cases more than a decade - longer than individuals convicted today of the same crime , ' mr @entity46 said in a post on the @entity16 blog			1
the 22 individuals , whose punishments will expire on july 28 , were sentenced between 1992 and 2006			2
mr @entity46 said tuesday 's commutations underscore @entity0 's ' commitment to using all the tools at his disposal to bring greater fairness and equity to our justice system			1
' mr @entity0 has now approved a total of 43 commutations during more than six years in office			1
mr @entity46 noted that @entity0 's predecessor , @entity76 , had commuted 11 sentences during his two terms			1
@entity79 ( left ) from @entity80 , was imprisoned for 235 months for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in a letter , the president urged each individual to take advantage of the second chance he is giving them			1
the @entity16 said it was the first time @entity0 had sent such letters			1
' i am granting your application because you have demonstrated the potential to turn your life around			1
now it is up to you to make the most of this opportunity , ' he wrote			2
' it will not be easy , and you will confront many who doubt people with criminal records can change			2
perhaps even you are unsure of how you will adjust to your new circumstances			0
' but remember that you have the capacity to make good choices , ' @entity0 said			1
the nonprofit @entity109 , which advocates for less stringent drug sentences , praised the commutations			1
' the president 's actions today are welcome , ' said @entity114 , policy manager at @entity109 's office of national affairs			1
he called on @entity117 to ' act quickly on substantive sentencing reform , ' adding , ' it 's time to rectify the @entity121 's embarrassing record on mass incarceration			0
