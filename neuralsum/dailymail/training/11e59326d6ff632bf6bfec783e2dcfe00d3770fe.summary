@entity0 went undercover on a marital affair website to find out reasons men cheat @entity4 recently said : ' marriage does n't need sex			1
' but one sexpert begs to differ , saying a marriage may not need sex - if you do n't mind your husband playing away			1
now @entity0 , author of controversial tell - all book the @entity13 , has gone undercover to ascertain exactly why men stray from long - term relationships - and to lift the lid on how to prevent it			1
@entity0 undertook the project as research for her new book , @entity20 , in which she explores modern models of relationships as alternatives to marriage			1
she worked along with adult lifestyle website @entity26 to discover why men stray from long term relationships and reveal how to deal with it			2
@entity0 says : ' while researching my next book i spoke to hundreds of men and women about their relationship blips , successes , affairs or their choices not to commit at all			1
' i ’ve targeted men on the @entity40 ’s largest cheating website , maritalaffair.co.uk and even been undercover on that and so - called sugar daddy websites to get to grips with common male motivations for straying			1
' @entity0 found that sexual dissatisfaction was the most common ' complaint ' cited by men as a reason to stray , with men saying things like , ‘ the physical side has faded , ’ or ‘ our sex has become routine ’			1
in this case @entity0 advises you need to make time for sex - and the more you orgasm , the more you 'll want to			1
she also says if you have relationship problems - another big reason men cheat - try counselling before splitting			2
but some of her findings are a lot less predictable			2
sexual dissatisfaction was the most common ' complaint ' , with men saying ' the physical side has faded ' here , femail reveal @entity0 's top five surprising reasons why men cheat ... 1			1
feeling surplus to @entity70 amongst new fathers and the partner of someone with a demanding job			2
the less busy partner feels unneeded			2
think bored housewife and a husband who does n’t even notice when she gets a haircut			2
or the hard - working husband whose weekend is filled with nothing but more chores			2
these types complained that their relationship had become functional			2
they craved the freshness of new romance and went elsewhere to find it			1
what to do : relationships should make us feel loved and energised otherwise we ’re better off alone			1
so make your partner feel that way			1
stop keeping tabs on who ’s done what			2
in the long run it does n’t matter			2
take time every day to talk and listen to each other - even if it ’s just for 15 minutes over dinner or while you have pre-bedtime cup of cocoa			1
' take time every day to talk and listen to each other - even if it 's just for 15 minutes over dinner ' 2			1
in love but lacking romance i was surprised by how many men said they loved their wives deeply and were not looking to end their marriage , but wanted ‘ something extra ’			1
not necessarily sex but the romance - dinners and dates			1
many expressed they wanted to ‘ feel like they looked forward to seeing someone again			2
’ what to do : sadly familiarity can cancel out passion even though familiarity is what we all want from a relationship			0
it ’s easy to steer your relationship away from dreary domesticity though and become fascinated in each other again			0
many expressed they wanted to ' feel like they looked forward to seeing someone again ' 3			0
partner health @entity136 one partner has health problems which limit their sexual life , the other partner may consider this as an amnesty on fidelity			1
any previous guilt is removed by the fact that their partner can no longer fulfil roles in the relationship that they once could			0
i met several men who claimed their wives had consented to them seeking sexual - but not emotional - fulfilment outside of marriage			1
what to do : consent is key here			0
just because you think you ’re not cheating , does n’t mean your partner would n’t feel cheated			0
there ’s nothing wrong with a negotiated open relationship but for those that ca n’t handle the thought of that , you ’ll have to address the sex imbalance some other way			1
just because you think you 're not cheating , does n't mean your partner would n't feel cheated 4			0
the ‘ one last time ’ @entity166 amongst men and women who are about to get married or make a similar commitment			1
they feel they can hold onto their previous identity with one last experience of their old life			0
they mistakenly believe that one final memory will sustain them for years ahead of ‘ being good			0
’ what to do : this is just a fantasy			0
‘ one last time ’ wo n’t make them feel any more experienced than they already felt when they committed			1
if you suspect your partner is daunted by the idea of long - term sexual fidelity , embrace their sexual appetite rather than try to repress it			1
encourage them to talk about things they would like to try and to share their fantasies so they feel you will help them fulfil them rather than hanker them			0
why not organise a naughty weekend away with sexy lingerie and some fun masks and ropes and pretend you ’ve just met			0
even if it ’s just ten minutes from home			0
opportunism is rarer than people may think 5			0
opportunismthankfully more rare than people may think			0
a man or a woman is out of town and a new , exciting and novel experience comes up and they think ‘ no one will ever know			0
’ it does happen but not often			0
to act on a fantasy usually requires mental preparation and lots of suppression of guilt so it ’s unlikely a quick chat on a bar stool in a strange hotel will make someone jump into bed			2
in my experience , people who stray on a whim have done it before or already given it some thought			0
what to do : it ’s easier to say what not to do			0
do n’t keep tabs on your partner			0
do n’t be controlling or demand they phone			0
too much control only makes someone want to break free			0
trust builds respect and there ’s no better defence to cheating than respect .			0
