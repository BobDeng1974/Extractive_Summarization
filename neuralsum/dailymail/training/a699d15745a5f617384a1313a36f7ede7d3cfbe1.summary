@entity0 is achieving something at @entity2 this season which eluded @entity4 at @entity5 and , more recently , @entity6 at @entity7			1
how does a manager integrate so many new recruits - many from abroad , who do not speak the language well and have to adapt to the culture - into a side and get results immediately ? @entity2 ’s win against @entity16 on saturday turned their surprise start to the season into a run with a bit more substance			1
@entity21 was on the scoresheet for @entity2 as they beat @entity24 take a look at the side which lined up at @entity27 in the league against @entity16 this time last year — which was demolished 3 - 1 - and @entity0 has gutted the squad			1
there were eight changes to the starting xi on saturday and five of those were summer signings			2
it cost @entity4 his job at @entity5 when he failed to get the most out of £ 100million worth of new players and @entity6 is now experiencing a similar difficulty at @entity41			2
@entity0 has done a good job working in the new players at @entity2 into the existing squad but a key advantage @entity0 has over those men is his experience as a manager — 20 years , 13 of those in the @entity50			1
@entity21 is the second player in @entity50 history to score in his first six starts in the competition , after @entity54			1
‘ learning from the early days of the @entity50 with @entity55 , an influx of eight , nine , 10 , 11 players , 75 to 80 per cent foreign , taught me one lesson particularly : do n’t just think about the player , think about family , ’ @entity0 explained			1
‘ how you integrate them into the culture			2
provide all the needs for them to settle as quick as possible			2
‘ the player settles quicker , they come into the club environment and are accepted by the captain			0
but the outside , when they go home , is very important ; girlfriend , wife , family , make sure they settle into the right area			0
@entity75 celebrates at the final whistle with @entity77 after @entity2 beat @entity16 2 - 1 ‘ it ’s hard to do , particularly if they do n’t speak @entity80 well			1
i get a feel about a player when i speak to them			0
there are players i ’ve spoken to and decided not to sign because of that last interview			0
better doing it then than getting them here and having problems			0
’ two summer signings , @entity21 and @entity91 , are forging one of the most frightening strike partnerships in the league			1
with a greater focus on attacking football this campaign , facing @entity2 is a different prospect to last season			1
this is reflected in the difference between @entity0 ’s starting xi from last season ’s home defeat to @entity16 and saturday ’s win in the corresponding fixture - only three players started both games			1
only three players played for @entity2 against @entity16 last season ( left ) and on saturday ( right ) @entity21 headed the winner against @entity16 , to score in his seventh consecutive game			1
@entity112 , meanwhile , set up the first with a lightning run down the right to roll the ball to fellow recruit @entity117 to tap in			0
the show was run by @entity77 , on loan from @entity120			0
full back @entity121 , the fifth new player starting , crossed deep from the left for @entity21 ’s winner			1
@entity0 added : ‘ we give them the tools , then it ’s down to them			1
if they are determined and have that much desire they take it up from there			0
’ to help integration , the players take breakfast together every day at their @entity140 training ground			0
club captain @entity141 and @entity142 take the lead on helping the players adapt and a @entity146 - speaking physiotherapist helps with communication			0
@entity117 opened the scoring for @entity2 as they moved to within a point of @entity16 it is not one way , either			1
@entity117 sat an @entity80 exam while flying to an away game recently			0
‘ it ’s good they have come here and are making a real effort to speak our language , ’ @entity142 said			0
‘ whether it ’s giving encouragement in training , or asking if they need anything , it ’s about keeping them happy			0
’ right now , everyone is happy at @entity2 - even @entity166 is learning to love them			2
‘ @entity166 has just text to say “ well done big man ” , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ this shows how important it was for him , never mind us			0
the result was n’t for him			0
it was for us and everyone at @entity2			2

@entity0 is drawing on his experience at @entity55 to get his foreign stars settled at @entity2
new signings @entity21 and @entity91 played a key role in @entity2 *'s* win over @entity16
@entity2 are in the top four and just one point behind champions @entity16
