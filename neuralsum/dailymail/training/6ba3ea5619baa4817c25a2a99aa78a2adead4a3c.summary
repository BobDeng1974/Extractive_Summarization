however , she claims she did not receive correct care throughout her pregnancy and claims this amounts to the child in effect being ' murdered			1
' lawyers for the 23 - year - old revealed she is planning to sue the prison believing the link between her not being allowed to fulfill her cravings and the stillbirth to be ' substantial '			1
in march she spoke about how it was ' pure torture ' waking up with cravings for everything from bananas on toast through to cheese flavour crisps - none of which were possible to satisfy in jail			2
she said : ' these cravings are a way for a woman 's body to tell her what foods are needed to satisfy the mineral and vitamin requirements of the unborn child			1
' by denying me access to those foods they are causing mental torture to myself and physical risk to my unborn child			2
' the cravings make me really sick because i ca n't get the food i crave for unless i get visits from my family , and the only thing i can do is keep on suffering			2
what pains me most is that my child is in pain also - i fear i could lose the baby because of these cravings , but i have the feeling nobody cares			2
' @entity63 's baby was conceived during one of the ' intimate visits ' allowed under @entity9 law			2
the father is her husband , @entity67 , a convicted drug dealer that she met while on remand			1
doctors had previously said the child was developing normally			2
@entity72 , a medic from the @entity74 penitentiary who took care of the pregnant woman , says the malformations were due to stress			1

@entity63 has told prison officials that it was ' pure torture ' waking up with cravings for everything from bananas on toast through to cheese flavour crisps - none of which were possible to eat in jail ' then they said it was a girl			0
i do n’t think they even bothered to look at the scans properly			0
it was all just superficial			0
how can it be that the baby was allegedly fine and is then born with no hands and died shortly after delivery ? ' when @entity63 was told her baby was born she repeatedly shouted out ' they killed my baby ' @entity9 daily @entity118 reported today			0
it was also reported @entity63 went into a deep shock before dissolving into floods of tears			0
