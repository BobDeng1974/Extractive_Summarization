by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:15 est , 20 february 2014 with his sporting prowess and undeniable good looks , @entity3 is widely regarded as one of the most desirable men in the world			0
but what would he look like if he did n't have the luxury of all the grooming products and stylists that fame brings with it ? one company decided to look into what some of the biggest celebrities would look look like if they had n’t found fame - and the team of hair stylists , make - up artists , cosmetic surgeons and fashion consultants that come with the package			0
what would @entity25 say ? international sex symbol @entity3 has been treated to a make - under by a team of experts who wanted to see what celebrities would look like if they had n't found fame the design team created some concept images using existing pictures of a selection of celebrities showing what they may look like if they lived in the mundane world and the results are hilarious and ridiculous in equal measure			1
the best makeunder of the bunch is undoubtedly 38 - year - old @entity3			0
with his fluffy hair , bushy unkempt beard and furrowed brow , @entity3 looks more like a loveable and rugged hillbilly than an international sex symbol			0
can you beliebe this ? without his trademark quiff and million dollar bling , teen heartthrob @entity52 is akin to a small alien not so super : @entity56 has been stripped of her model makeover and looks like your average girl next door rather than a world - famous model teen heartthrob @entity52 too has been treated to a ' unbeliebable ' transformation			1
without his diamond earrings , quaffed quiff and @entity66 smile , the 19 - year - old popstar resembles a tiny alien			0
complete with a giant afro and more natural beauty look , superstar @entity70 looks more like her less famous sister @entity71 in her make - over			1
supermodel @entity56 has also been given a makeunder and is shown with blotchy skin ( perhaps from all the partying ) , chapped lips and badly - dyed hair			1
not so flawless : without her perfectly styled locks and impeccable make - up , @entity78 @entity70 would n't be @entity81 with this look what a poker face ! @entity84 , known for her eccentric style , looks like an average 20 - something without her ice - blonde hair and heavy make - up speaking about the project , www.vouchercodespro.co.uk , who helped create the images , said : ' have you ever caught yourself in the middle of a daydream wondering how you would look if you had millions in the bank and an endless amount of fashion and beauty help at your fingertips ? ' no wonder the a-listers all look so perfect when you take into the account the ridiculously long list of people whose job it is to make the @entity66 elite look effortless whilst they walk up and down the red carpet			1
' this time around , we decided to focus on some of the most famous a-listers in the world , and the elements of their image that signify their international fame			0
' examples of this included reducing @entity56 and her prominent eyebrows , as well as highlighting how @entity3 would look if he embraced the more rugged look of a beard and scruffy hair			2
' @entity84 was indeed a tricky one , we attempted to emphasize how she may look with less make - up and a plain , brunette hairstyle , although i ’m not sure if that woman could ever look normal if she tried ! ' just your average girl : the same design team decided to create what they think @entity130 would look like if she was n't famous - and the result went viral not such a bad gal now : @entity133 looks fresh - faced and innocent in the design team 's ' non famous ' version of the singer @entity137 , is that you ? mrs o , who has admitted to having plastic surgery , looks much older with her grey hair and winkles in the images taking it too far : the design team focused on features on the celebrities that they believed had clearly been professionally worked on , such as @entity151 and his perfect teeth haggered : @entity153 , 50 , looks old beyond his years in the virtually adapted image			2
