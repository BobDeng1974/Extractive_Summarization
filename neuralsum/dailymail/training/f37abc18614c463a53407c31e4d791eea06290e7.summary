a mysterious @entity1 's - like illness , which appears to be spreading uncontrollably among teenage girls at a @entity4 high school , has left doctors totally baffled			1
so far 14 girls and one boy at @entity8 in @entity4 have shown symptoms including facial tics , sores , involuntary twitching and uncontrollable verbal outbursts			1
at first the bizarre outbreak was put down to mass - hysteria - a peculiar stress related condition which has been known to occasionally affect groups of girls			0
mystery : 15 students at @entity22 , many of them cheerleaders , have spontaneously begun showing signs of a @entity1 's - like illness frustrated : @entity26 , 16 , ( left ) and @entity27 , 17 , ( right ) are among 15 girls at @entity29 in @entity30 suffering sudden uncontrollable outbursts and tics the school then brought in brain specialist dr @entity34 who diagnosed an illness called conversion disorder which can cause symptoms similar to those caused by @entity1 's such as partial loss of muscle function , paralysis and speech problems			1
now leading environmental activist @entity45 has been called in to investigate suggestions the youngsters may have been poisoned by a chemical spill			1
some parents have reported sightings of an orange substance oozing up through the soil onto the school playing fields			1
on the case : campaigning lawyer and environmental activist @entity45 is investigating reports of an orange substance oozing onto the school playing fields @entity45 , 51 , famously played by @entity61 in the 2000 movie , believes the mysterious ooze may be the result of a chemical spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the school			1
according to a 1999 report by the @entity72 @entity71 , almost one tonne of cyanide crystals spilled to the ground in the derailment , along with 130,000 litres of trichloroethene			0
the crystals were removed but the trichloroethene was absorbed into the ground			0
in 1996 , @entity45 fought and won a mass lawsuit for an estimated $ 333 million dollars against @entity80 , who allegedly contaminated drinking water in the town of @entity84 , @entity85			1
she claims to have received more than one hundred emails about the school and has now sent a team of scientists to collect soil samples			1
she said : ' there are reports from parents that at the atheletic field where all the children have been there is an orange yellow substance oozing up from the ground			1
' when i read reports like this that the @entity4 @entity103 and state agencies were well - aware of the spill and you do n’t do water testing or vapor extraction tests , you do n’t have an all - clear			1
' we do n’t have all the answers , but we are suspicious			0
they have not ruled everything out yet			0
the community asked us to help , and this is what we do			0
' one victim 17 - year - old @entity115 , described how she ca n't stop her arm swinging across her face and suffers uncontrollable face twitches			0
she said : ' i started twitching constantly			2
sometimes it gets me to the point i want to cry from twitching so much			2
' i do n't like even going into stores any more because i feel like people are staring at me			0
unexplained : the teenagers , mostly girls , have developed tics and seizures			2
the majority of sufferers attend @entity8 another victim 16 - year - old @entity129 added : ' a lot of people say we are faking it			0
' i 'd like to see anyone do what we do 24 hours a day and try to fake that			0
if i could stop i would			0
' school administrators would not disclose exactly what they think has caused the outbreak but insist it is not a case of mass hysteria and that none of the girls are making the illness or symptoms up			1
earlier this month , the school held a forum for concerned parents			2
about 150 people attended , demanding to know what was wrong with the students			2
expert : dr @entity154 , with the @entity4 @entity103 , said he is unable to disclose what the cause of the symptoms are due to privacy laws dr @entity154 , with the @entity4 @entity103 , said : ' i can assure you these children have all been seen by professionals that have come up with answers and they are all being treated and they 're actually doing pretty well			2
' dr @entity154 revealed that tics like this can be caused by a number of factors such as genetics , head trauma , drugs for adhd and ocd and antihistamines			2
through tests over the last few months , they have been able to rule out a number of environmental factors , infections , illegal drugs and carbon monoxide poisoning			0
but @entity183 believes @entity4 officials might have prematurely ruled out environmental reasons for the teens having neurological symptoms			1
according to @entity190 , the @entity188 in @entity189 has been consulted , along with @entity191 , as well as the @entity192 and the @entity193			0
dr @entity154 assured parents that these cases have been seen nationwide and they come and go in individuals			0
@entity1 's syndrome affects the body 's brain and nervous system by causing tics - repeated , uncontrollable movements or involuntary vocal sounds			1
strangely two other girls who attend a school in @entity206 , @entity207 , around 250 miles away , have reported the same symptoms .			1
