facebook heads are considering incorporating most of its 1 billion - plus members ' profile photos into its growing facial recognition database , expanding the scope of the social network 's controversial technology			1
the possible move , which @entity10 revealed in an update to its data use policy on thursday , is intended to improve the performance of its ' @entity15 ' feature			1
the feature uses facial recognition technology to speed up the process of labeling or ' tagging ' friends and acquaintances who appear in photos posted on the network			1
the technology currently automatically identifies faces in newly uploaded photos by comparing them only to previous snapshots in which users were tagged			0
facebook users can choose to remove tags identifying them in photos posted by others on the site			0
