although @entity3 did some light training in the gym over the weekend , after sitting out the defeat by @entity13 , he is taking no chances just six days before @entity18 names his provisional squad for @entity20			1
it promises to be an emotional night , with @entity5 captain @entity22 making a farewell appearance at @entity7 before he joins @entity24 on a free transfer — and interim boss @entity26 is believed to be considering the option of naming himself in the squad			1

we ’ll have to wait and see			0
' the 40 - year - old will ' take into consideration ' the fact tuesday ’s game could be his last at @entity7 , but insists : ' i want to do what ’s best to win			2
' a number of other @entity5 stars could also be playing there for the last time , including @entity49			2
like @entity22 , the @entity50 will be out of contract at the end of the season more than eight years after they joined the club at the same time in january 2006 , from @entity56 and @entity57 respectively			2
the pair have since won five @entity60 titles , the @entity61 and three @entity62 together , but @entity49 and the man he calls ‘ @entity64 ’ could not have got off to a worse start			0

i ’m really sad to lose @entity64			0
’ although 40 - year - old @entity26 ’s future at @entity7 is unclear , @entity6 manager @entity86 believes @entity5 would be foolish not to offer him a significant role when @entity89 takes over as manager			1
@entity86 , a former team - mate of @entity26 at @entity5 , even joked that he ’s got a job at @entity6 if he finds himself out of work in the summer			1

’ with @entity60 safety sealed , @entity86 plans to make several changes to his team tonight as he plans for the @entity105 final on saturday week			2
