@entity0 is ready to play for @entity1 in next summer 's @entity2			1
and the @entity4 wonderkid could be joined by @entity6 midfielder @entity5 , who 's confirmed he is open to being included in @entity8 's squad for the tournament in the @entity10			1
@entity0 's decision to inform senior manager @entity12 that he was suffering of leg weariness ahead of last sunday 's clash in @entity15 has divided opinion this week - with some even questioning the youngster 's commitment to @entity1			1
@entity0 ( above ) came off the bench for @entity1 against @entity15 last week after saying he was tired @entity0 and @entity5 ( left ) want to play for @entity8 's @entity1 next year @entity0 faced criticism for telling @entity12 ( left ) he was fatigued before @entity1 's match against @entity15 but @entity22 understands @entity0 , provided an agreement between @entity4 and the @entity24 is reached , will show he is fully committed to @entity1 by sacrificing his summer break should southgate select the @entity4 star			1
@entity0 feels the prospect of tournament football can aid his football development			1
@entity8 's men booked their place in the tournament , which kicks off on june 17 , with a play - off win over @entity34 earlier this week			1
@entity22 has led calls for @entity8 to pick the strongest possible squad available to him , meaning a number of players who have established themselves in @entity1 's senior set - up taking a step down to under 21 level for the tournament			1
the likes of @entity44 , @entity0 , @entity45 , @entity46 all qualify for the @entity1 - as do @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , who all have full international caps			1
@entity0 replaces @entity4 team - mate @entity52 in the 64th minute for @entity1 against @entity15 @entity0 responded to criticism via @entity54 ( above ) with the message : ' be yourself do n't please anyone ' @entity0 has been in superb form for @entity4 this season , scoring three times already @entity44 has become the first to publicly reveal he will play for the @entity1 21s this summer , if asked			1
speaking ahead of his appearance on the @entity63 on @entity64 1 on thursday night , the @entity6 star said : ' would i play for the @entity1 21s this summer if asked ? yes , you ’d never turn your nose up at something like that			1
' but there ’s a lot that goes into that because the national team have two games around the same time as the tournament			0
' so it ’s up to @entity12 to decide if he wants			1
there ’s a lot of players in the @entity1 squad at the moment that could drop back down and play for the @entity1 so it ’s up to the manager to decide			2
' i do n’t know the dates			0
when that time comes around i ’ll have to think about it			0
@entity8 might not even want me			0
' it ’s a discussion that will be had closer to the time with the @entity1 manager , someone at @entity6 and @entity8			2
' @entity22 have led the calls for @entity8 ( above ) to have every player available for next summer @entity50 ( right ) dropped into the @entity1 for their qualifying play - off wins over @entity34 @entity8 could have as many as eight extra players available to select for the @entity94 next year : @entity0 , @entity4 @entity45 , @entity6 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity48 , @entity6 @entity50 , @entity95 @entity46 , @entity95 @entity49 , @entity96 @entity47 , @entity96 the clamour for @entity1 's eligible senior players to feature in the next year 's tournament was reinforced by @entity100 and @entity101 - who have both worked for the @entity1 - on thursday			1
@entity103 manager @entity101 , a former under 21 boss , said : ' if you want a successful international side , you ’re going to have to make sure your best players go to tournaments , which i ’ve said time and time again			0
' i 'm not going to change my tune now			0
the bottom line is our best players should be going to a major tournament if they ’re age appropriate and available in my opinion and that does n’t change			0
' @entity118 boss @entity100 , who worked as @entity101 's assistant in the @entity1 set - up in 2007 , added : ' i do n't think there is a debate			1
we have it completely the wrong way round			0
the question that needs to be asked is whether the @entity24 invokes the rule it could do			0
' every other federation does it but unfortunately this country we seem reluctant			0
that stems from the fact the @entity24 do n't have the clout other federations have			0
clubs basically run football in this country			0
@entity118 manager @entity100 ( above ) has insisted @entity8 should be able to pick any eligible player ' they can call them up , every other country does			2
i 'm stating what the facts are			0
i 've worked for the @entity24 and it 's very frustrating when you ca n't get your best players			2
' the prospect of established senior international 's playing for the @entity1 next summer will not please everyone , though			1
managers will be eager for their young stars , especially those who were part of the @entity155 squad earlier this year , to have maximum time off ahead of next season			2
it is likely any decision that will see full internationals take a step back to @entity1 will only come after lengthy discussions with clubs			2
@entity45 ( above ) and @entity48 are also eligible from @entity6 to play in the tournament but @entity165 ( above ) has said publicly he is not happy with the idea of them playing next summer and @entity6 manager @entity165 , who could see three of his senior players named in @entity8 's squad , says he would prefer for @entity5 , @entity45 and @entity170 to miss the tournament			1
' you know my thinking on this , once a guy has moved up to the full national team , you put him down ( again to the @entity1 ) he is never good , ' insisted @entity165			2
' apart from on the selfish front for us , when a guy has played 50 games , it is better a guy has a good rest during the summer			0
' but most of the time , when they move down , they are not completely at their quality			0
' @entity189 rest row rumbles on			0

@entity0 proves commitment to @entity1 by asking to be included
@entity4 star joins @entity5 in wanting to be involved
@entity0 *slated* for telling @entity12 he was tired before @entity15 game
the *19* - year - old was left on the bench for @entity1 's 1 - 0 win on sunday
@entity45 , @entity48 and @entity47 among others eligible
