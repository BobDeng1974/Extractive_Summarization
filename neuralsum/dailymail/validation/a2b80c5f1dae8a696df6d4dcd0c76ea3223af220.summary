health secretary @entity0 is to issue a humiliating apology after @entity2 exposed him for misleading the @entity3 over who will foot the huge compensation bill for victims of @entity7			1
in a statement to the @entity3 last week , mr @entity0 pledged that @entity7 ’s charities are responsible for paying up to £ 40 million due			1
but this newspaper can reveal that the charities are exempt – and that it is the @entity12 which is liable			1
the @entity2 has also learnt that a further bill , which may eventually be as large , will be met by @entity15 licence fee payers			1
‘ he will be writing to the @entity24 to correct it , ’ she said			0
she said the @entity12 had not set aside a ‘ specific pot ’ of money , but added : ‘ we are committed to picking up any claims the estate can not cover			1
’ the @entity31 estate is already effectively bankrupt			1
mr @entity0 addressed the @entity32 after the publication of reports which detailed @entity7 ’s abuse of victims at @entity37 in @entity38 and elsewhere			1
he told @entity39 that a total of £ 40 million was still ‘ under management ’ in two charities @entity7 established and ‘ that money will be made available to meet claims made by @entity7 ’s victims ’			1
mr @entity0 added : ‘ if it is not enough , the government will meet any further claims through the @entity48			2
’ @entity7 founded the charities , mainly to fund healthcare , they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate , which is already effectively bankrupt however , although @entity7 founded the charities , mainly to fund healthcare , they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate			1
last year the @entity58 and the @entity59 made clear that they can not be asked to meet any compensation costs or damages			2
and yesterday it emerged that neither charity held anything close to £ 40 million anyway			0
the @entity7 @entity65 had around £ 1.75 million when it was wound up in 2013 , and the accounts to december 2014 show the @entity7 held £ 3.4 million			2
@entity67 , the charities ’ solicitor , said : ‘ there is no way funds in a charity can be used to pay compensation to victims , as this is not permitted by charity law			1
the only funds that can be used to pay compensation are the estate funds			1
’ the @entity15 has also agreed to pay the legal costs and damages for those abused on its premises			1
yesterday a spokesman refused to reveal how much the @entity85 had earmarked , saying only : ‘ the terms of the scheme were agreed with lawyers for the victims , as well as the @entity12 and the @entity31 estate			1
’ as of november last year , the @entity31 estate was worth £ 3.2 million			0
but almost all of this is certain to be eaten up in fixed payments to lawyers agreed under a ‘ fast track ’ compensation scheme for which about 200 people have applied			2
so far just 39 claims have been rejected			0
as this newspaper reported last year , under the scheme each claim will trigger payments of up to £ 16,000 to lawyers			0
further payments will be made to law firm @entity104 , which runs the scheme on behalf of @entity7 ’s executors , @entity107			2
the firm had already been paid £ 500,000 when the scheme was approved by the @entity59 in november , and will be due more			0
in many cases , the damages paid will be less than the legal costs			0
the @entity7 @entity65 had around £ 1.75 million when it was wound up in 2013 , and the accounts to december 2014 show the @entity7 held £ 3.4 million but this is not the end of taxpayers ’ liability			0
as well as claiming under the fast track scheme , alleged victims can also sue @entity7 ’s estate directly in the @entity58			2
in last year ’s court hearings it emerged that numerous actions are being considered – with damages and costs likely to be higher			0
however , bedevilling these is a lack of documentary records , and evidence of some false claims by individuals			0
ms @entity67 added : ‘ it seems impossible to quantify the potential bill			0
the number of abuse allegations greatly outweighs the number of claims being brought under the scheme			0
it could be years before the @entity12 knows the total cost			0
’ shadow health secretary @entity139 said : ‘ it is of great concern that @entity0 could give such misleading information to victims and the @entity32 on a matter of this significance			2
he needs to return to the @entity32 at first opportunity to apologise to victims and correct the record			0

@entity0 is to issue an apology after misleading @entity3
last week he pledged @entity7 's charities would pay compensation
but it has been revealed that the charities are exempt and @entity12 is liable
a further bill , which may be as large , will be met by @entity15 licence fee payers
@entity7 estate is effectively bankrupt , while @entity15 agreed to pay damages
