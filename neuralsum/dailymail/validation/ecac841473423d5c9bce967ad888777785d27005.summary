former @entity1 defender @entity0 has picked his # one2eleven of stars he has played alongside throughout his career , on the @entity5			1
it is no surprise that @entity0 's team is dominated by @entity1 players past and present , as the left back played in the side that won the 2005 @entity11			1
but @entity13 winner and @entity15 's long - standing captain @entity14 gets a worthwhile mention with team - mate @entity17 , and @entity19 's @entity18 also gets a look in too			1
watch # one2eleven every friday evening on the @entity5 , @entity21 1 or catch up on demand			1
@entity0 - @entity0 said his former @entity1 team - mate @entity23 ( centre ) was ' always trying to make jokes ' goalkeeper : @entity23 ' he 's the funny one			1
he 's always trying to make jokes and has so much confidence in himself , which to be a goalkeeper you really need to have			1
' right - back : @entity32 ' the most calm person i 've ever seen ; never stressed			1
not the most defensive right back but i really enjoyed playing with him and never seemed to make any big mistakes			1
' the quartet of ( left to right ) @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 were all included defender : @entity40 ' i remember one game against @entity47 [ in 2003 ] and he broke his leg			0
he did n't want to get carried off , he wanted to walk off			0
he wanted to carry on playing			0
he 's a proper , proper defender			2
he 's an easy choice			2
best defender i 've ever played with			2
defender : @entity39 ' great right foot			0
good in the air because he 's 2 metres tall			2
one of the nicest guys i 've ever met in football			0
' @entity59 team - mate @entity18 took up a place as left back as @entity61 also featured left back : @entity18 ' he was a machine			1
very quick , strong , powerful , offensive , defensive			0
even if you pass him he was so quick at turning he 'd catch you up again			0
he gave me a big fight [ for my position ]			0
' defensive midfield : @entity61 ' he 's a dog			2
i know the opposition hated playing him because he 's always on your toes and always tackling you			2
' defensive midfield : @entity17 ' sees openings and passes that maybe not many other players could see			1
he will go down as one of @entity15 's greatest players			1
' @entity0 ( second right ) described his 2005 @entity11 winning skipper @entity42 as ' the perfect captain ' defensive midfield : @entity41 ' probably the pass master			1
nobody can pass the ball like him			0
i remember on his debut at @entity87 , it probably took him about 39 minutes before he misplaced a pass			0
' @entity90 : @entity42 ' best player i 've played with without a doubt			2
i 'm really privileged to have played with him because @entity95 will go down as the greatest of all time			0
he 's an amazing person also and for me he was the perfect captain			0
' @entity15 legend @entity14 ( left ) was one of three @entity99 players to be named in @entity0 's dream team striker : @entity14 ' the @entity102 of @entity103			1
i 've never seen anything like it			0
as a football player he 's not quick and he 's 38 - years old now but he has his technique and ambition , and a touch that 's @entity102 's gift			1
' striker : @entity112 ' he has got a bit of stick since he left @entity1 and still has to come back to his best form , but while i was there he was a scoring machine			1
i think the pressure was too much for him at @entity120			0
i think it got to him a little bit and it was too much to handle			0
i think he 's back where he belongs [ at @entity126 ]			0

@entity0 - @entity0 named his # one2eleven xi on the @entity5 on @entity21
eight @entity1 players past and present make the cut in @entity0 's team
five of those players played in their *famous* @entity11 win in 2005
@entity14 and @entity17 also make the @entity139 's xi
