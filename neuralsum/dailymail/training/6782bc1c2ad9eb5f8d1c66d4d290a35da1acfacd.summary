by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 14:00 est , 29 january 2014 a @entity3 magazine has apologised and pulled their february issue after seemingly copying a distinctive front page tribute to the victims of the @entity8 bombings			1
the cover of @entity11 ’s february issue features dozens of running shoes arranged in a heart shape to promote the @entity16 city ’s upcoming half marathon			1
but the design is nearly identical to one used by the @entity18 to honor the three people killed and more than 250 injured when the @entity21 race was targeted by terrorists			1
insensitive : the @entity11 has provoked outrage with a front cover that copies the design of a tribute issue by @entity8 magazine commemorating those killed in 2013 's terrorist atrocity an emergency responder and volunteers , including @entity34 in the cowboy hat , push @entity36 in a wheel chair after he was injured in the explosion near the finish line of the @entity8 @entity34 ( left ) and @entity36 ( right ) were invited by president @entity40 to hear his @entity41 on tuesday , january 29 the cover - which featured real trainers used by runners in the doomed race - raised more than $ 125,000 for those injured by the atrocity last year			1
@entity18 editor @entity48 is now demanding its @entity11 counterpart make a ‘ significant donation ’ to the fund			1
in a scathing web message posted on its website addressed to the @entity11 he said : ‘ last spring , as we tried to figure out how best to honor the resilience of our city in the wake of the @entity8 bombings , we asked runners to lend us the shoes they wore in the race			1
‘ in turn , their shoes , and the cover we produced , helped us to raise over $ 125,000 for the one fund , the charity established here to benefit those affected by the bombing			1
‘ you liked the shoes cover so much that you borrowed ( others have used less charitable phrases ) the concept for your february issue on the half marathon in @entity11			1
‘ we ca n’t speak for the dozens of runners who donated their shoes to us for that image			2
@entity83 firefighter @entity82 carrying an injured girl away from the scene after the bombing near the finish line of the @entity8 respect : a shrine on @entity90 , @entity83 , to the victims of the bombing accused : brothers @entity93 ( left ) , who died in a shootout with police after the bombing , and @entity98 ( right ) are both suspected of carrying out the atrocity ‘ we ca n’t speak for the runners who are preparing to run this april			1
‘ but we hope that if you were so bold as to borrow our idea , you will also borrow the spirit of that cover - and make a significant donation to the one fund in the name of those who were unable to finish the race			2
’ at first the @entity11 tweeted an apology - but did not say whether it would make a donation to the fund			1
a message sent on tuesday said : ‘ we would like to make an unreserved apology for any upset or offence caused by our latest cover			2
this was clearly not our intention			0
‘ we are truly sorry and embarrassed for what has happened			0
we shall be looking into this immediately and post a full apology in due course			0
’ @entity21 took to @entity123 to slam the stunt			0
@entity125 from @entity126 said : ‘ what an amazingly insensitive " apology " i hope @entity128 [ the photographer ] holds you accountable for copyright infringement			0
’ @entity132 from @entity83 tweeted the @entity11 organisers and said : ‘ hey @entity11 , who died in your marathon ? ’ responding to the online backlash , the magazine tweeted added : ‘ we do n’t mean to bring up bad memories , just supporting our runners in @entity11			1
’ but it only served to provoke outrage from one @entity83 resident who said : ‘ @entity8 killed three people and injured at least 264			1
" bad memories " ? are you kidding me ? ’ @entity147 replied : ‘ by ripping off a cover we made to honor the victims of the marathon bombing ? nice one			1
’ condemnation was echoed on this side of the @entity154 by @entity155 , from @entity156 , who said : ‘ it ’s inappropriate to copy a tribute to people who have died to advertise tourism			1
’ @entity161 from @entity156 added : ‘ will the @entity11 now face a boycott similar to @entity164 ’s boycott of @entity165 ? for a cover and ‘ justification ’ like that , it ’s due			1
’ the @entity11 eventually published an open letter of apology from publisher @entity172 to the @entity8 magazine on its website			1
it said : ' late in the process of creating our front cover we were made aware of the @entity83 magazine cover , and while we were inspired by it , we realize we have made an error of judgment by not fully realising its connotations in the @entity182			1
' our intention was to create a front cover that reflected the twin themes of the inclusive nature of the @entity187 and @entity188 , this being our february issue			2
so we had the idea to feature a heart on the cover but with a running theme coupled with the message on loving the @entity187			2
we started to search for an image from the usual stock libraries , then we decided to create our own			0
' the letter stated that the magazine would be making a contribution to the @entity200 and asked the city to ' accept our apology from one community to another '			0
however , some considered this second apology offensive , too			0
@entity207 wrote : ' i 'm from @entity83 and honestly i do n't believe this is a sincere apology			2
you 're like a child who got got caught taking a cookie from the sweets jar			0
i know it 's a business but next time be more considerate			0
' a final tweet on wednesday afternoon from the magazine said that they would be pulling the edition and reprinting it with a different image on the front			0
' open letter to the @entity18 : the @entity11 publisher @entity172 would like to offer his sincere apologies to anyone who found the similarity between our image and the @entity18 cover in any way upsetting , as clearly we did not wish to cause any offence			1
we are proud to be supporters of the @entity187 , and indeed members of our staff are running in this year ’s race			0
our intention was to create a front cover that reflected the twin themes of the inclusive nature of the @entity187 and @entity188 , this being our february issue			2
so we had the idea to feature a heart on the cover but with a running theme coupled with the message on loving the @entity187			2
we started to search for an image from the usual stock libraries , then we decided to create our own			0
we invited runners to lend their trainers for our photograph and interviewed them about their motives for running the half marathon			0
you can read some of these moving and inspirational tales inside the magazine			0
mr @entity172 said : ' late in the process of creating our front cover we were made aware of the @entity18 cover , and while we were inspired by it , we realize we have made an error of judgment by not fully realising its connotations in the @entity182			0
' ' on a personal note , i ran the half marathon last year during which time i met many runners , each with their own battle to fight and individually determined to finish			0
some had suffered personal tragedies and were doing what they could to raise money and beat their own demons			0
' i am running the @entity187 on march 2nd and as well as supporting many of our local charities , the magazine will be making a contribution to the @entity200			2
' please accept our apology from one community to another and accept that our intentions were well meant			0

the 2013 @entity83 bombing killed three and injured more than 250 people
@entity8 magazine produced a charity tribute issue using running shoes
the @entity11 magazine provoked outrage with a design that looks very similar
many have been left angered by the apologies offered by @entity3 publication
backlash prompts @entity11 magazine to pull cover
