@entity1 prices are falling all over @entity2 as the property market ends the year with a whimper			1
the value of the average home fell in nearly a third of @entity2 postcodes in the three months to november , according to property website @entity9			1
this compares with declines in less than one in five areas last spring , and is further evidence to suggest the housing market is now cooling			2

a quarter of @entity17 post codes areas are now experiencing falling prices — up from about 5 per cent in may prices fell in a quarter of the capital ’s postcodes in the three months to november – compared with just 5 per cent in the three months to may			1
among the worst hit areas of the @entity2 are @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 near @entity30 , @entity31 in @entity32 and @entity33 in @entity34 , where prices were rising strongly earlier in the year			1
in @entity17 , the worst - affected markets include previously booming @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 – as well as @entity41 , home to the rich and famous			1
the softening of the market follows a clampdown on risky mortgage lending by the @entity47 , and worries that some areas have become overpriced			2
‘ everything is coming off the boil very quickly , ’ said @entity9 ’s @entity49			2
‘ we have had a huge surge of pent - up demand coming into the market from january 2013 onwards , but we are now running out of people who want to move or can afford to move			0
’ despite the recent slowdown , house prices are still up on this time last year , with @entity60 figures last week showing the average home is now worth £ 271,000 – up 10.4 per cent year on year			2

but as rising prices in the capital have pushed more homeowners out , surrounding areas remain popular			1
the report shows demand among buyers in the @entity2 is highest in the @entity17 borough of @entity109 , where 71 per cent of homes up for sale have been sold			2
the next strongest is @entity34 at 67 per cent followed by @entity112 , in south @entity17 , at 65 per cent , @entity113 at 64 per cent and @entity114 , @entity115 , at 63 per cent			2
‘ the property market in @entity17 has cooled right down , ’ said mr @entity116			1
he warned the capital will ‘ continue to stagnate and possibly even drop ’ , but added : ‘ a staggering number of northern locations are enjoying a rise in demand			2
’ the new figures come after forecasters said house price growth would slow next year as tighter mortgage rules and stagnant wages continue to bite in much of the country			0
despite falling house prices in a quarter of post codes , the cost of buying a home continues to rise on average across the country the @entity135 forecast that house prices would rise by 3 percent next year on average , with increases of as much as 5 percent in much of northern and central @entity137 but stagnant prices in @entity17			1
‘ the recently announced and long overdue reform of stamp duty is likely to provide a tonic for the market across many parts of the country , particularly for first - time buyers , ’ @entity139 , the @entity135 chief economist , said			0
‘ that said , the bigger affordability issue is not going to go away , highlighting just how important it is to speed up the supply pipeline of new homes over the coming years			0

prices grew 10.8 per cent in @entity137 , 5.7 per cent in @entity156 , 4.9 per cent in @entity28 and 4.9 per cent in @entity157			0
in @entity137 , prices grew fastest in the @entity153 and @entity159 – up 11.9 per cent and 9.6 per cent respectively			0
