two years ago , they were nobodies			0
@entity1 was a scrappy political candidate			2
@entity2 was a revhead from @entity4			0
but the @entity6 and @entity7 senators could fast become ' very , very powerful ' , political operatives said , if they split from @entity9 and set out on their own			1
that 's exactly what the senators did on wednesday , when they flexed their muscles , breaking away from @entity6 by announcing they would vote to stop the government 's @entity17 rules			1
going against a deal @entity6 had previously signed with the government , @entity1 and @entity2 linked up with @entity45 , the @entity46 and maverick senators @entity47 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 to almost certainly defeat the proposal			1
it could be a sign of things to come , thanks to the maths in the @entity57			2
political strategist @entity58 told @entity59 and @entity2 could become an influential voting bloc in their own right , particularly as the government needs 39 votes to pass laws , or at least six crossbenchers			1
' if they 're smart , @entity66 and @entity1 could form their own little alliance , ' said political strategist @entity58 , known as the ' preference whisperer '			1
mr @entity58 , who used to work for @entity2 , said the two senators could bounce between the @entity6 bloc consisting of @entity6 senators @entity72 and @entity73 , and the four other crossbenchers			1
' by moving between the day - @entity76 bloc and the @entity6 bloc they could put themselves into very strategically important positions			1
' if they do team up and become a little bloc on their own , and work with the other power blocs , they are potentially very , very powerful			0
' @entity9 this morning demoted the rebellious senator from @entity6 's senate leadership and barred her from party room meetings following weeks of internal warfare			2
the @entity88 senator has become a vocal critic of her own party 's policies recently , particularly @entity6 's stance on a pay deal for @entity95 personnel			0
missing someone ? @entity1 's visage has vanished from this @entity6 webpage split : mr @entity9 described ms @entity1 's demotion as a ' sad situation ' in a radio interview this morning happier times : @entity9 stands with senator - elects @entity1 ( middle left ) , @entity72 ( far right ) , @entity73 ( left ) and the @entity106 's @entity2 following the 2013 federal election explaining her @entity23 flip to reporters today , ms @entity1 said : ' sometimes when you make a wrong , you have to go back in there and make it right			1
and that 's exactly what i 'm doing			0
' in an interview with @entity118 on wednesday morning , mr @entity9 described it as a ' sad situation ' for ms @entity1 but denied his party was unravelling			1
' well , we 're 100 per cent united			0
' that 's just one person , one member out of thousands , who 's having a particular problem , who has n't resigned from our party			0
' he also accused mr @entity2 of ' backflipping ' , saying : ' after he ’s got the government to accept all the changes he ’s wanted he ’s decided to change his mind when it comes to him delivering on that arrangement			2
' @entity6 's @entity72 told reporters he was hoping things would stay together and that ms @entity1 would not leave the party			1
signs are n't good she will change her mind			0
senator @entity1 has scrubbed the @entity6 name and logo from her website			2
and she is not talking to her @entity6 colleagues , mr @entity72 said			0
' i love @entity1 , i think we get on really well , and the party has achieved quite a number of things throughout the year , ' he said			0
' i 'm just a bit bewildered about the fact that she wo n't talk to us			0

@entity1 and @entity2 today broke with @entity9 , announcing they would vote to disallow government financial rules
there is *speculation* ms @entity1 will soon quit the @entity6
political strategist @entity58 says both senators could ' potentially become very , very powerful ' if they strike out on their own
@entity57 maths means they could ' put themselves into a very strategically important position , ' mr @entity58 said
