@entity0 speaks during a news conference in @entity2 fierce laws brought in to protect the @entity5 language in @entity2 are under the spotlight after a recent spate of rulings - including a restaurant that was condemned for using the word ' pasta '			1
the @entity12 is the body responsible for ' safeguarding ' the region 's @entity5 language , which is spoken by 94 per cent of people in the region			1
but recent rulings have prompted ridicule from the @entity21 - speaking minority			2
it follows a spate of draconian decisions , including : many of the area 's @entity5 speakers are equally dismissive of the crackdown on foreign languages			0
the backlash prompted @entity12 president @entity31 to resign from her role , as @entity0 , the @entity2 minister for language , ordered a review of the latest incident where ' pasta ' was deemed one of ' too many ' foreign words used by an @entity39 restaurant			1
' it was a big crisis , ' admitted @entity41			0
' we had 60 countries report on this issue , and we were n't all very proud about it			0
but at the same time , this was also an opportunity			0
' quit : @entity31 , pictured presenting an @entity48 peacekeeping certificate , has stepped down from her role she promised that the language office will be 're - structured ' following the latest embarrassment , and the body will be conducting an internal review in the face of negative media coverage			1
but the aim of the @entity12 will still be to protect the @entity5 language , which is seen as being under constant assault by @entity21 speakers across the rest of @entity60			1
the recent evidence suggests that the @entity63 campaign has stepped up a gear in recent years but there has been no shortage of ridicule over the years - and not always because of @entity12			2
many people do support the bid to protect @entity5 , and it is not unheard of for members of the public to threaten taking organisations to court for not respecting the language			0
in the @entity77 , a pet shop owner was threatened with legal action because it had a parrot named @entity81 that only repeated @entity21 phrases .			0

latest embarrassment for the @entity12
*previously* ordered a restaurant to cover up the word ' redial ' on phones
a @entity91 themed restaurant being ordered to rename fish and chips as *poisson* frit et *frites*
another restaurant being ordered to mask the word ' redial ' on its telephones with tape
a third restaurant being ordered to remove the letters @entity102 from the *lavatory* doors - despite the *abbreviation* 's *popular* use in @entity107 , and
a *distribution* *company* taken to court because it only *provided* @entity21 *instructions* for its @entity113 *sex* *toy* .
