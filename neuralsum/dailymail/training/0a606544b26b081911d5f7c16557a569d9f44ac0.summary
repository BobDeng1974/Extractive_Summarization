it is the racing game set to send shivers down @entity4 's spine			1
and with @entity7 boasting visuals like these , it ’s not hard to see why			1
there are 29 confirmed cars set to feature in the game , including the @entity12 and @entity13			1
breathtaking : many felt underwhelmed when seeing the @entity15 racing exclusive @entity4 in action			0
@entity17 5 , however , is a marvel in full flight there are also – for the first time in the game ’s history – open - wheel cars including the @entity25 and @entity27 cars such as the @entity28 and @entity29			1
so far , there are four confirmed tracks – including @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			2
the addition of the latter stage is likely to please @entity17 fans most			0
nestled in the @entity41 countryside of @entity42 , the 4.3 - mile spa track is home to legendary corners like ' @entity45 ' and ' @entity46 ' and has been one of the most requested tracks from fans since the @entity17 series ’ beginning			1
to ensure maximum authenticity , the environment has been laser - scanned and meticulously recreated at 1080p and 60fps			1
in comparison , the @entity52 looked remarkably last - gen - with muddy textures and the demo riddled with environmental ' pop up '			2
developers turn 10 studios have also overhauled the physics engine			2
working closely with @entity59 – the leading tire testing organization in the world – they have developed a completely new and unique set of tire data , including tests and parameters that have never before been utilized in racing games			2
' developing and improving the driving physics has , in many ways , become the central pursuit for the @entity7 series , ' said @entity7 creative director @entity71			0
' we are always chasing that perfect simulation where we can accurately recreate the infinite variables of driving in the digital world			0
at the same time , that pursuit is always tempered by the limits of what we know about the science of vehicle dynamics and the properties of high performance materials			0
tour - de - force : the @entity17 games have always pushed the boundaries with regards to realism , and the new physics system will do the same again ‘ we are implementing truly cutting edge scientific understanding of tire physics , suspension geometry , and aerodynamics – we ’re not implementing the recommendations of last year ’s text books , we ’re running the tests that will write the vehicle dynamics text books of the next several years			1
' for the player , this boils down to new level of immersion and challenge each time they play the game			0
