admission : @entity1 with his partner , @entity2 a senior @entity3 has revealed that he was approached dozens of times by wealthy supporters who offered £ 1million or more to buy seats in the @entity7			1
in remarks that threaten a new cash for honours controversy , the party ’s former treasurer @entity1 admitted yesterday he told business people who made such approaches ‘ several times a year ’ to ‘ keep quiet ’			1
the peer said he had advised would - be donors it would be against the law to sell an honour , but conceded there would be quasi-corruption in the political system until party funding is reformed			2
‘ in politics a lot of people particularly give big money because they want something , ’ said @entity1 , who was in charge of @entity3 finances for 12 years			1
‘ they either want to influence the party ’s policies , or they want access to the leader , or in a lot of cases they want some sort of honour , which of course is a criminal offence			2
‘ unless you restrict the amount of money that can come into the political process , you will always have quasi-corruption			0
’ asked if he had been made ‘ dishonourable ’ offers , the peer told @entity49 : ‘ oh @entity50 , yes			1
‘ anybody who has been a party treasurer of any of the three parties will tell you , if they are honest , that there are numerous people who came to you and said , “ i will give you a million pounds as long as i can go into the @entity7 ”			1
‘ there ’s nobody to who that has not happened , and everybody knows what you have to say , which is , “ i ’m terribly sorry , that ’s a criminal offence			0
would you mind keeping quiet ? ”			2
’ asked how often wealthy individuals attempted to buy honours over his 12 years as treasurer , @entity1 replied : ‘ i should think several times a year			1
‘ if you were to ask the treasurer of the @entity71 party or the treasurer of the @entity70 , and get them to be honest , they would say exactly the same			0
’ under the @entity75 , it is a criminal offence to offer ‘ any gift , money or valuable consideration as an inducement or reward for procuring or assisting or endeavouring to procure the grant of a dignity or title of honour ’			0
but asked why he failed to report offers of cash for honours to police , @entity1 said : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s an offence , no. ‘ the offence would be to procure an honour for somebody in return for a payment			1
‘ all i can say is that a lot of treasurers would have to spend a lot of time at the police station if we had to report anyone who said that to us			0
’ @entity1 said he was approached dozens of times by wealthy supporters who offered £ 1million or more to buy seats in the @entity7 earlier this year former @entity106 spokesman @entity105 – who quit the party after being exposed as being involved in a plot to oust its leader @entity109 – also raised questions about donors			1
he complained that his efforts to ‘ expose and end cash for peerages in all parties , including our own ’ , had failed			0
@entity116 , former chief executive of the @entity117 , said : ‘ this is further evidence that the @entity7 is a totally undemocratic body and the sooner we make it elected or scrap it altogether the better			1
’ non-domiciled peers who do not pay tax in the @entity123 were banned from peerages in 2010 under @entity70 , with cross-party support			0
but deputy prime minister mr @entity109 ’s plans to slash the number of peers from more than 800 to 450 , with 80 per cent elected , was dropped after 91 @entity128 rebelled and @entity70 refused to back the move			0
the original cash for honours scandal saw several businessmen who loaned money to @entity70 – which unlike a donation did not have to be declared – nominated for life peerages			0
a police investigation saw then prime minister @entity137 questioned by detectives and @entity70 forced to repay the loans , although no charges were brought			0
it is a criminal offence to offer ‘ any gift , money or valuable consideration as an inducement or reward for procuring or assisting or endeavouring to procure the grant of a dignity or title of honour ’ ( file picture ) the @entity3 have been heavily dependent on millionaire backers who have been made peers			2
of all cash donations to the party in 2012 , more than £ 600,000 – or 40 per cent – came from wealthy supporters who were subsequently appointed to the @entity7 by mr @entity109			1
they include @entity158 owner @entity157 – now @entity159 of @entity160 – who has donated more than £ 500,000 to the party			2
and @entity163 ’s pizza tycoon @entity162 was made @entity164 of @entity165 after handing over £ 770,000 , some via his company @entity167 there is no suggestion that any of the peers has done anything wrong			1
party leader mr @entity109 has said businessmen are ‘ perfectly ’ entitled to give the @entity3 large sums and it is unfair to suggest they should not separately be nominated for peerages			0
a party spokesman said : ‘ the @entity3 have robust procedures in regards to handling donations that comply with all legal requirements			0
‘ all staff involved in the process are aware of the rules and regulations surrounding donations and these are always made clear to the donor at the outset			2
