by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:34 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 17:39 est , 24 january 2014 @entity5 ’s attempt to enshrine his promise of an @entity8 referendum in law is a ' dead parrot ' , mps warned tonight			1
@entity12 and @entity13 peers in the @entity14 united to defeat the @entity15 in key votes today , plunging the legislation into a parliamentary quagmire			1
it means it stands little chance of becoming law before the 2015 election , leaving @entity23 to liken it to the dead parrot in the infamous @entity26 sketch in which a pet shop owner repeatedly pretended there was still life in it			1
blow : @entity5 , who used a speech at the @entity32 today to attack the @entity8 , wants an in - out referendum by 2017 mr @entity5 today launched a fresh attack on @entity35 , claiming @entity36 fear if they do not produce more rules and regulations they are ‘ not doing their job ’			1
he said @entity42 workers risk becoming ‘ unemployable ’ because @entity8 red tape means foreign firms will take their business elsewhere			2
he urged global firms to bring jobs back to @entity42 , but warned that ‘ complex and overwritten directives ’ impose such heavy burdens on business that those looking to relocate will opt for countries outside the @entity8			2
mr @entity5 promised that if he is prime minister after the next election he would claw back powers from @entity35 before holding an in - out referendum by 2015			1
@entity15 peer @entity56 said the legislation was suffering ' death by a thousand cuts ' however , he could not bring forward government legislation on the idea because @entity63 said the @entity13 would not back it			1
instead , @entity15 mp @entity65 took it through the @entity67 but it has floundered in the @entity14			0
today peers voted by 245 votes to 158 , majority 87 , to amend the wording of the question that would be put to voters in the referendum in 2017			1
it means the @entity76 will have to go back to the @entity67 for further consideration - eating up more of the little remaining parliamentary time for its consideration			1
eurosceptic @entity15 mp @entity80 said : ‘ as i understand it from the @entity14 , the @entity81 is now , in effect , a dead parrot			0
’ lord @entity84 , @entity85 leader in the @entity14 , added : ‘ @entity12 and the @entity13 have today done yet another u-turn on their position on an in - out referendum on the @entity76			2
‘ having accepted this @entity90 in the @entity91 , they are now trying to kill it in the @entity14			0
having stayed mum in the @entity67 , they have now been revealed in their true colours			0
‘ although they dare n’t admit they do not think the @entity42 people should have their say , they are trying to do their dirty work unnoticed in the @entity14			0
‘ voters will see through this subterfuge and realise that only the @entity85 will give them their say on whether they should remain in the @entity76			0
’ the @entity90 has already passed its @entity67 stages			2
peers were under pressure to pass it speedily and without amendment to ensure it could proceed before the end of the parliamentary session			1
but peers voted to amend it after more than two and a half hours of impassioned and sometimes angry debate in the @entity114			0
@entity115 , who is trying to steer the @entity116 , warned it risked suffering ‘ death by a thousand cuts ’			0
he said : ‘ we know some of the opponents of the @entity90 are determined to use any means to kill it			0
‘ we can not deny the presence of an elephant in the room and a very large and unreasonable elephant - those who have no intention whatsoever of working to improve this @entity90 but who are solely intent on trying to kill it			0
‘ if this @entity90 is to survive and we are to give the people the referendum they want , we have to get this @entity90 through this @entity14 in reasonable shape and very short time			2

lords torpedo legislation to ensure referendum is held by 2017
@entity5 wanted law passed before the @entity141 in may
but amendments mean it is now *bogged* down in parliamentary quagmire
