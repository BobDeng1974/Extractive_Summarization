their plight was summed up on the whistle			2
after a game @entity4 just had to win in order to retain any hope of survival , the supporters warmly applauded as they trudged off			1
the fans realise what dreadful circumstances interim manager @entity10 has pitched up in			1
it was better but ultimately not enough			2
the @entity13 looked every bit a side to have scored just three goals in their previous eight games ; plenty of huff , but very little puff			1
had @entity21 ’s @entity20 not crashed the bar from 25 yards and later blazed wildly over , it might ’ve been worse			1
@entity4 now look consigned to relegation and upbeat @entity10 will treat the remaining eight fixtures as an audition for when the club make a permanent decision on @entity29 ’s successor in the summer			1
@entity4 's @entity30 ( right ) and @entity21 's @entity31 ( left ) battle for the ball @entity35 winger @entity34 ( right ) dribbles with the ball during the match against @entity21 at @entity38 @entity4 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity30 ( @entity44 73 ) , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity34 ( @entity47 81 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 73 ) , @entity50 subs not used : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 booked : @entity34 , @entity48 @entity21 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity20 , @entity60 , @entity31 ( @entity61 45 ) , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 75 ) , best ( @entity66 75 ) subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 referee : @entity73 attendance : 9,105 ‘ the boys could n’t give me any more apart from a goal , ’ he said			1
‘ the support they gave was absolutely terrific			0
we ’re just trying to give them the belief , to get the fans back onside			0
’ @entity10 believes this is already a side the fans can identify with again after disaffection under @entity29			1
‘ i was n’t always the best player on the pitch here but i played with my heart on my sleeve , ’ he added			0
‘ we maybe lacked a little bit of creativity in the final third and we ’re searching for a goal to kickstart us			0
‘ the league table does n’t lie - games are running out			2
you have to start somewhere			0
we need to add to that			0
‘ we ’re in a difficult position but we ’ve got games to win			0
’ this is n’t fair on the young boss			0
it could well be a case of right job , wrong time for the man who ’s adopted the club for which he appeared in the 2004 fa cup final and who stood right behind him when beating testicular cancer			2
@entity21 defender @entity111 ( left ) slides across to challenge @entity4 's @entity30 ( right ) on the wing @entity21 striker @entity113 ( left ) prepares to cross the ball ahead of @entity4 's @entity43 ( right ) the caretaker has brought more intensity and , while @entity21 ’s @entity113 drew a smart save from @entity39 at the near post , the better opportunities fell to @entity46 and @entity119			1
these were small steps in a mission to rejuvenate themselves , and something @entity123 has noted			0
‘ they started well , ’ the @entity21 boss said			2
they ’ve got a very good club man in the job at the moment			0
’ @entity132 means @entity10 wo n’t be implicated in the probable relegation , and for now he ’s just intent on putting smiles back on some faces			1
@entity21 forward @entity136 ( left ) and @entity4 's @entity137 ( right ) tussle for the ball at @entity38 @entity21 's @entity31 ( left ) tackles @entity4 's @entity30 during the @entity140 match at @entity38			1

@entity4 's *chances* of beating relegation continue to look unlikely
