both bills are expected to receive approval from the legislative branch but its unclear if they would receive enough votes in the @entity54 to nullify a veto			2
@entity0 said today that the bills provided @entity32 with the opportunity to begin his last two years in office by signing into law measures that would advance the economy			2
' unfortunately the president 's been taking steps towards more confrontation rather than bipartisan cooperation on jobs , ' he said			1

' let ’s keep the voters in mind who sent us here , and let ’s remember what they told us in november			0
one of the things they told us is that they ’d like to see more teamwork across the aisle , ' @entity83 said on the @entity54 floor			0

' ' this frustration that 's out there , they need to take it out on somebody			0
take it out on the president , take it out on me ... it comes with the territory , ' he said , brushing off attacks from supporters of his own political party			0
but @entity0 pooh pooh 'd accusations that he 's part of the problem			0
the @entity5 speaker pointed out that he he supported the earmark ban and brought the lower chamber back to regular order			1
he said he 's also allowed more members from both sides of the aisle to participate in the political process than any other speaker			2
' i 'm pretty conformable in my own skin , and i 'm gon na do my best to show all our members , @entity142 and @entity1 , and those members who voted against me , that i 'm up to the job that i was given , ' he said			1
@entity0 narrowly survived a challenge to the gavel on tuesday after 25 conservative members of his caucus revolted			0

allies of the speaker what him to exact retribution on more of the dissenters in order to ward off future ambushes and ban them from chairing subcommittees in the @entity5			1
other representatives think such actions would be too heavy - handed , however , and @entity0 promised before the vote that he would not retaliate against @entity1 who voted against him			2
@entity0 told reporters on wednesday that the @entity1 would work out its issues during a ' family conversation			2

' i 'll tell you what pains me the most is when they describe me as the establishment , ' the @entity1 leader said .
' i 'm the most anti-establishment speaker the @entity5 has ever had '
addressing the the @entity5 's threats to veto @entity39 pipeline legislation and a change to @entity193 , he *criticized* the timing
' at a minimum he could have waited a few hours ... . we were taking our oath of office , and they were issuing veto threats . come on ! '
