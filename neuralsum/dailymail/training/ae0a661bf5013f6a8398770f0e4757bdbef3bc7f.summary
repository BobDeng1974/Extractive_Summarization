@entity0 turned travel expert to write her latest column for glossy magazine @entity3 , listing ' what she deems to be ' the very best of the world 's top ski resorts			1
inviting her readers to ' boot up , clip in , and make fresh tracks ' , the 31 - year - old contributing editor proceeds to recommend a series of luxury locations in the mountains , from @entity14 in @entity15 to @entity16 in @entity17 , a favorite with the @entity19 - who are , of course , ms @entity0 's in - laws			1
' come wearing either a party hat or powder skis ; there 's never a dull moment at this resort , ' she writes about the @entity17 resort			2
' on - piste skiing here is n't too challenging			0
' @entity48 , @entity17 @entity49 , @entity50 @entity51 and @entity52 , @entity53 @entity14 , @entity15 @entity54 , @entity55 @entity42 , @entity56 @entity57 , @entity58 @entity59 , @entity50 @entity16 , @entity17 @entity60 , @entity17 @entity61 , @entity62 indeed , only last week prince @entity68 , his daughter @entity65 and prince @entity67 's former girlfriend @entity66 were pictured enjoying a weekend getaway at the @entity17 resort , staying in a luxury £ 22,000 - per - week chalet			1
ms @entity0 , who began writing for @entity3 in june 2013 , is widely known to be a skilled and enthusiastic skier			2
she has even competed in a number of cross country races at some of the very resorts featured in her recent column			0
in march 2013 , the socialite and her banker boyfriend @entity41 took part in the 26 - mile @entity82 in @entity60 , @entity17 , alongside ms @entity0 's younger brother @entity83			1
the following year the couple slowed things down a bit in order to enjoy a more relaxed getaway in @entity89 , @entity56			0
both resorts are included in her @entity3 piece			0
royal favorite : @entity16 in @entity17 is favored by many members of the @entity19 , including @entity68 ( @entity94 ) and his daughter @entity95 ( r ) , who were both there last week luxury living quarters : the @entity67 and his daughter stayed in this luxury £ 22,000 - per - week chalet in total ms @entity0 recommends eleven resorts in the @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 , highlighting their various positive attributes of each one and in some cases suggesting which ability levels would be best suited to different resorts			1
but while the author , who published her own party - planning book celebrate in 2012 , details her own personal trips to several of the resorts - praising the traffic - free roads in @entity48 , @entity17 and the pristine powder in @entity89 , @entity56 - she does n't actually make clear whether or not she has visited all of the locations included in the column			1
unsurprisingly however , given her fondness for the speedy snow sport , she still writes with authority when it comes to describing the pros and cons of each resort - even sharing her own unique observations about her preferred places			0
' @entity61 ] has a decidedly @entity129 feel , with lots of people wearing cowboy boots , ' she says of the @entity62 - based resort , before recommending that visitors try out the @entity136 sleigh rides			0
rising star : ms @entity0 is reported to have signed on as a correspondent for the today show she adds that visitors to the @entity17 resort of @entity60 should try and ski across the area 's beautiful frozen lakes , saying : ' [ the frozen lakes ] go on for miles , and a big highlight of the year is the @entity149 marathon , which happens in march			1
cover star : the new column features in the latest issue of @entity3 ' the @entity154 toboggan run , which i attempted five years ago on ladies ' day , is not for the fainthearted but is fun to watch			0
' she also praises the ' ambiance ' of @entity14 in @entity15 , the ' long runs ' of @entity53 's @entity51 resort and the ' good shops and restaurants ' that can be found in @entity54 , @entity103			0
interestingly , although she is one of @entity3 's star contributing authors , alongside the likes of @entity169 and @entity170 , ms @entity0 's column failed to be featured on the cover of this month 's issue			1
instead , the royal in - law has been relegated to the 76th page of the publication - perhaps an indication that her column , once revered as one of the highlights of the magazine , has fallen out of the highest favor with her editors			2
but that may not bother ms @entity0 particularly as it has been widely reported that she has been signed up as a correspondent for @entity187 's today show			2
in november last year , the @entity188 paid a visit to @entity190 , reportedly to meet with executives from the show and discuss her provisional contract , believed to be worth an estimated $ 500,000			0
following her meeting , ms @entity0 jetted off to @entity61 , @entity62 - another location which is featured in her latest @entity3 column - where she was spotted at a hoedown dance with locals surrounded by cameras			1
it is believed that she was filming a test piece for the today show .			0

the 31 - year - old recommends resorts in the @entity102 , @entity50 , @entity17 , @entity56 and @entity58
ms @entity0 , who is the *duchess* of @entity207 's younger *sister* , is one of the publication 's contributing editors
despite her celebrity status however , her newest column failed to be featured on the magazine 's cover
