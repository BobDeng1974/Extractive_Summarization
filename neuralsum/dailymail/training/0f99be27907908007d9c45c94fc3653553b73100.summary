by @entity0 for @entity1 it ’s a well - known fact that a dog is a man ’s best friend , and one baby girl has got a pretty close bond with her canine companion too			1
two - year - old @entity9 plays with her huge pet @entity11 mastiff like he ’s a big cuddly toy and despite his daunting appearance , he ’s happy to go along with it			0
called @entity16 after the @entity17 , the huge dog simply lolls on the floor blissfully while the little girl crawls around in his golden mane , cooing gleefully as this cute video shows			1
@entity11 mastiffs were originally bred as guard dogs by nomads who wanted to protect their camps in @entity28 , but now they 've become a status symbol in @entity30			1
one man recently paid a whopping £ 1.2 million for one of the golden - haired beasts - who really must have had a mane of gold to warrant that sum			0
the puppy went under the hammer at a luxury pet fair in @entity41 in the eastern province of @entity43 earlier this year and is believed to be the most anyone has ever paid for a pet dog			2
what 's clear here is that this little girl is in the lap of luxury as she plays in her pet 's gorgeous fur coat			0
do n't mind me ! @entity9 clambers over @entity16 while the big dog snoozes , nonplussed by the little girl			0
