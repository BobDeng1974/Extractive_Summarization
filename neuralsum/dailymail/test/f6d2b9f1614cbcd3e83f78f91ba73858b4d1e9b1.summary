two @entity4 parents whose hands - off ' free - range ' parenting got their children picked up by police yet again on sunday are now vowing to file a lawsuit			1
@entity8 and @entity9 have been cited multiple times for allowing their son @entity11 , 10 , and daughter @entity13 , 6 , roam free in their suburban neighborhood			1
but the @entity16 , both of them scientists , say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up @entity11 and @entity13 and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents			1
picked up : officials seized @entity13 , 6 , ( far left ) and 10 - year - old @entity11 ( left , blue hat ) on sunday in a @entity4 park			1
the parents @entity8 and @entity9 ( right ) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours attorney @entity31 , of the firm @entity32 , is representing the @entity16 and on tuesday sent a ointed letter regarding sunday 's events			1
@entity35 wrote : ' the actions of @entity37 and @entity38 violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children			1
' this fundamental , constitutional right of parents can not be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent ’s reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children			2
' the firm declined to say who the suit would be against , exactly , when asked by the @entity50			0
however , the attorney has vowed to pursue ' all legal remedies ' to protect the rights of the @entity4 parents			2
the @entity16 made headlines just before @entity56 when police found @entity11 and @entity13 walking the sidewalk on their own			1
picked up again : the @entity16 say they were left to panic for hours by @entity37 workers after their children -- who they raise with a so - called ' free - range ' approach -- were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone ' besides the policeman pulling up ... no ' : asked if he was scared during the hours - long ordeal sunday , 10 - year - old @entity11 admitted he was , but not because he 'd been left alone with his sister free - range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parenting '			1
' helicopter parents ' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring , micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe			0
however critics believe this creates under - confident , over-reliant children , while also causing the parents stress			0
free - range parents advocate a more hands - off approach , where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own			1
instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe , the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time , and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves			0
on sunday , a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home			0
the children were picked up by police , who say they followed protocol by turning them over to @entity37			1
meanwhile , mrs @entity109 tells @entity110 that @entity37 workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe			2
what 's more , the elder child , @entity11 , insists the scariest part of the hours - long ordeal was being picked up by police			1
‘ they kept the kids for hours , ’ a shaken @entity109 told @entity110 5 after being reunited with them			0
‘ it ’s 10:30 at night			0
they ’ve been missing since 6 o’clock … somebody called 911 and the police called @entity37 and they decided to bring the kids here and they did n’t call us			2
’ according to mrs. @entity109 , the children were expected home no later than 6:30			0
when 6:30 came and went , they became frantic			0
they would not receive a call from @entity37 until 8pm			0
even then , they say they were n't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours			1
in the interim , @entity11 tells @entity110 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift			2
@entity11 said : ‘ the policeman said “ we ’ll give you a ride home ” when we were like two blocks away			0
and two and a half hours later , after sitting in the car two and a half hours , he said “ i ’ll bring you home ” and , instead , he brought us here			0
’ ' here ' was @entity150 , @entity11 said			0
and as he and his sister sat waiting to go home , their parents say ' upper management ' at @entity37 was involved in keeping that from happening			2
only at 10:30pm did mrs. @entity109 say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash			0
parenting style : the @entity16 believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age guarantees : as part of their free - range parenting philosophy , the @entity16 make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street ‘ they made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up , ' and i ’m not gon na risk my kids being snatched again like this by @entity37			1
' when questioned , the @entity16 say they believe in a so - called ' free - range ' approach to parenting , which encourages independence from infancy			1
in march , the @entity37 found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone			1
it meant the agency would start a file on the family 's activities and whereabouts for at least five years			0
the @entity16 hit back at the ruling , insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences			2
unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge , but is in most cases a prelude to such charges			0
it usually comes when the @entity37 has deemed parents to have neglected their children , but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action .			2

police seized @entity11 , 10 , and @entity13 , 6 , in a @entity4 park on sunday and their parents say they were n't reunited by @entity37 for hours
scientists @entity8 and @entity9 believe in ' free range parenting ' meaning the children are afforded total independence from infancy
the @entity16 were found guilty of neglect in march . after sunday 's *incident* they were forced sign a paper *pledging* not to leave them unattended
