by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:50 est , 8 november 2013 @entity3 : 19:51 est , 8 november 2013 an outbreak of a measles - like virus affecting @entity8 dolphins has become the largest in history - resulting in 753 dolphins washing up on beaches along the @entity11 since july			1
and it 's only getting worse			0
as @entity8 herds migrate south for the winter , they may spread morbillivirus to local groups in @entity18			2
the only other time an outbreak this bad happened was between august 1987 and april 1988 when the virus killed 740 dolphins			1
the current outbreak has already exceeded that death toll and if it plays out on the same time frame - it is n't even halfway over			1
outbreak : since july , 753 dolphins have washed up dead on @entity30 beaches , most having died form a strain of a measles - like virus spreading : researchers now fear that the outbreak will get worse with herbs moving south for the winter			1
above , researchers conduct a necropsy on a dead dolphin in @entity41 , @entity42 in august largest in history : the current outbreak has already eclipsed the last largest outbreak of morbillivirus which killed 740 dolphins between august 1987 and april 1988 while the virus has n't impacted other species of dolphins in the @entity51 and @entity52 , there is evidence that it may be killing some whales after the bodies of three humpback whales and two pygmy whales were recently found decaying on beaches			1
researchers at the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) have n't been able to confirm yet whether these whales were suffering from the same virus since their bodes were ' very decomposed '			1
@entity64 , of the @entity65 , said in a conference call today that the number of dead beached whales is ' slightly ' elevated ' from usual but that it 's too early to know if it 's an outbreak in the whale population			2
bottlenose dolphins continue to wash up on beaches on the @entity11 , but more and more are showing up further south as the herds migrate to @entity18 for the winter			1
researchers are now afraid that the outbreak will worsen and spread to local populations of dolphins in warmer waters			2
the virus spreads with contact and shared air			0
' we do n't know how this is going to play out , ' @entity64 said			0
whales as well : researchers believe that the virus may be spreading to humpback and pygmy whales , though it is n't impacting other species of dolphins too early to tell : @entity60 researchers have n't been able to confirm a whale outbreak since the five stranded bodies were so decomposed , making it hard to analyze their tissue unfortunately , all researchers can do is watch the outbreak unfold			1
' there is no vaccine that can be deployed for a large bottlenose dolphin population or any cetacean species			0
currently there is nothing that can be done to prevent the infection spreading , or prevent animals that get infected from having severe clinical disease , ' she said			0
while the disease ca n't be spread to humans , it does have the potential to impact people			2
the virus leaves the dolphins susceptible to secondary diseases or viruses which have the possibility to infect humans if they come into contact with the rotting sea creatures on the beach			0
the @entity60 recommends that any beached dolphins or whales be reported to local stranding coordinators			0
' what we 're trying to prevent people from doing is push them back out , ' @entity64 said			0
no help : researchers say there is nothing they can do to prevent the outbreak from spreading			0

*hundreds* of dolphins have washed up on @entity11 beaches since july
researchers say the *problem* has n't stopped and that bottlenose dolphins *threaten* to spread the disease during their *yearly* migration south
the bodies of five whales have also washed ashore , and may be suffering from the same measles - like virus
current outbreak of morbillivirus is largest in history , recently eclipsing previous outbreak in the late *80s* which killed 740 dolphins
