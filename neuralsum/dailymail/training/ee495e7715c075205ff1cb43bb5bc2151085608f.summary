click here for your ultimate stats guide , including how @entity4 's opening goal was all his own work and right here was the reason the @entity9 seedings have got to change next year			1
@entity10 are about as close to being among the top eight teams in @entity12 as @entity14 ’s mighty and magnificent @entity13 is to a wet wednesday at @entity15 , @entity16			1
they were outclassed in @entity18 , outplayed , at times torn apart , reduced to an imitation of a team that @entity12 blithely placed in @entity22 when the draw was made earlier this month			1
@entity10 have no business sitting beside the champions of @entity12 and the goliaths of the strongest @entity28 leagues right now			1
@entity14 striker @entity4 finishes off a great run by steering the ball past @entity31 and into the net @entity14 's @entity33 scores his side 's second goal after streaking clear of the @entity10 defence @entity37 ( left ) and @entity4 , @entity14 's two goalscorers , celebrate after the latter 's strike put the hosts two up @entity14 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity42 6 ; @entity43 7 , @entity44 6.5 , @entity45 6 , @entity46 7 ( @entity47 79 ) ; @entity48 7 , @entity49 6.5 ( @entity50 46 , 6 ) ; @entity51 7.5 , @entity52 8 , @entity53 7 ; immobile 7.5 ( @entity54 86 )			1

@entity10 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity62 6 ; @entity63 5 , @entity64 6.5 , @entity31 6 , @entity65 6 ; @entity66 5 ( @entity67 77 ) ; @entity68 6 , @entity69 5 ( @entity70 62 , 5 ) , @entity71 6 , @entity72 5 ( @entity73 62 , 5 ) ; @entity74 5			1
subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79			0
man of the match : @entity84 referee : @entity86 ( @entity87 ) 6.5 ratings by @entity89 at the @entity13 they have been allowed to make the most of an impressive run of qualifications and the odd foray into the last eight , but this can no longer hide the reality			0
the scoreline did not flatter @entity14			2
their margin of victory could have been doubled , even trebled , without complaint			0
their opening goal , in the final minute of the first - half , was their 15th attempt – and if anything their chances after half - time were better , if less frequent			1
they totalled 22 by the time referee @entity86 of @entity111 called a halt to a very one - sided contest			0
quicker , sharper , more intelligent , with greater determination at the back , quite simply @entity14 should not be this far ahead			2
@entity61 is a fine coach , but he presides over a club that is constantly battling to keep its finest players , often without success			0
the best are picked off , by @entity121 or the elite of @entity124 ’s @entity123 – @entity10 would fancy their chances of getting a player out of @entity14 every time , as they once did with @entity78			1
yet the @entity18 were on a different plane			0
only mistakes in front of goal stopped this being a painfully sobering rout			0
as it was , even the appearance of a 19 - year - old rookie , @entity63 , at right back can not excuse @entity10 ’s inferiority			2
nothing that happened was @entity63 ’s fault ; and @entity14 were missing @entity139 and @entity140			2
yes , @entity10 had the odd chance , too – but even this meagre resistance raised more questions than answers , all falling to new signing @entity74 , who did little to refute @entity147 ’s criticisms of him			1
the @entity148 , not reluctant to back his judgement even in the worst of times , may be saying that he told us so			0
@entity10 were desperate for a striker to supplement the injured @entity153 , but their problems run deeper than that			1
@entity66 was deployed to guard the back four , but that is not his natural role and it showed			0
@entity14 were too quickly into the heart of @entity10 ’s defence ; any team of attacking quality will enjoy playing against them now			1
@entity81 was once invincible with men like @entity164 in midfield			2
it seems incredible that he no longer finds such physically imposing figures relevant to how @entity10 play			2
the goals summed up @entity10 ’s malaise			2
the first was horridly soft and come from a bungled visitors ' throw - in			0
possession was lost , the ball was cleared and @entity4 picked it up inside his own half			1
@entity72 ( right ) , back in his native @entity18 , tries to get away from @entity14 's @entity46 early in the first half @entity14 midfielder @entity53 ( left ) goes for the ball with his foot up as @entity71 watches on intently @entity44 gets the better of @entity10 's @entity68 in an aerial duel during the match at the @entity13 @entity68 is pursued by @entity45 as he tries to get away from the @entity14 defender @entity14 's midfielder @entity52 takes the ball past @entity66 and looks as if he has been clipped in the area the @entity183 throws himself to the floor in an attempt to win a penalty for the hosts @entity52 hits the turf and cries out to signal that he has been fouled , but the referee @entity86 took the opposite view @entity52 reacts with disbelief after being cautioned - rather than being awarded a penalty - by the @entity87 official for his dive @entity10 @entity81 signals to the referee that the @entity14 star dived confounding those who love to mock his rather unfortunate surname , he began a run that took him through a very half - hearted @entity10 midfield and into the path of @entity31			1
the centre half – outstanding here last season – put in a lame challenge which @entity4 shrugged off easily , before striking the ball across @entity62 in goal			1
it was no more than @entity14 deserved			2
they had been by far the best team until that point			0
the second was little better from @entity10 ’s perspective			2
@entity33 , @entity212 born but playing for his father ’s country , @entity215 , had been wasteful in the first half but he made amends three minutes after the restart			1
a ball from substitute @entity50 caused unnecessary confusion in the @entity10 ranks , allowing @entity33 to nip in ahead of @entity64 , round @entity62 and finish smartly as @entity31 collided with a post in a frantic attempt to block on the line			1
and , yes , it could have been worse			0
immobile nearly grabbed his second , forcing an outstanding one - handed save from @entity62 , @entity33 had another shot hit the bar , and @entity52 lashed one over when a cooler head would surely have netted @entity14 ’s third			1
@entity63 ( right ) , making his first start for @entity10 , gets away from @entity14 forward @entity53 @entity10 goalkeeper @entity62 comes and clears everything out as @entity14 pile on the first - half pressure @entity45 somehow gets his leg above @entity74 's head as he challenges @entity10 's new £ 16m striker @entity74 stumbles at the back post under pressure and misses a chance to give @entity10 the lead @entity74 lies on the turf as he watches the ball go past @entity14 keeper @entity42 and the wrong side of the post @entity74 is on his knees after missing @entity10 's best chance of the first half @entity4 wheels away to celebrate giving the home side a thoroughly deserved lead at the end of the first half in @entity14 the @entity255 striker ( centre ) jumps for joy after scoring his first @entity9 goal and giving @entity14 the lead the first - half had been equally frustrating for @entity14 , not least after 27 minutes when @entity37 failed to take advantage of a lovely move that saw his team - mates switch the play from right to left			1
@entity43 , @entity49 and @entity53 were all involved before the ball found its way back into the centre where @entity33 was charging towards the target			2
he shot first time , but straight at @entity62 from close range			2
soon after , again picking up on a pass from @entity49 , @entity33 forced another good save from the @entity10 goalkeeper			1
@entity45 and @entity52 also wasted decent chances			0
@entity10 barely got a look in			0
when they did , @entity74 disappointed			0
after 31 minutes a cross from @entity68 eluded @entity14 goalkeeper @entity42 , only for the ball to get trapped beneath @entity74 ’s feet at the far post			1
his second miss was more glaring			0
put through by @entity69 , with only @entity42 to beat , his finish was snatched and wide			0
in the second - half , he had a last chance to apply pressure but demonstrated only the inconsistency that supports @entity287 ’s decision to sell			0
everything about his build - up play – his run , his touch – was lovely , but the finish was that of a novice , panicked , and a long way over			0
@entity14 were equally loose but their sheer volume of goalmouth opportunities ultimately won the game			0
with chances limited , @entity74 ’s misses stood out			1
there is a way to go yet , obviously , but @entity10 may already be eyeing second place in @entity303 are the next opponents , at the @entity305 , and a win is vital , if only to regain their confidence in @entity28 competition			0
this was a humbling night			0
@entity33 bobbles the ball into the empty net after rounding @entity62 early in the second half @entity33 celebrates doubling @entity14 's lead after a mistake by @entity62 , who was caught miles off his line and stumbled ( below ) @entity33 raced clear of the @entity10 defence for @entity14 's second goal ... for more go to our brilliant @entity318 @entity10 stars @entity74 ( centre ) , @entity69 and @entity71 look dejected after @entity14 's second goal @entity86 ( right ) , in the new officials ' kit for this @entity9 season , uses the vanishing spray @entity71 lies hurt on the turf after a hefty challenge but he was able to finish the match @entity72 scratches his head as he walks into the dugout after being substituted following another disappointing performance @entity74 gets into another good shooting position late on but blazes the ball over the bar @entity18 's @entity336 winner @entity67 came on for the last 13 minutes and missed this opportunity to test @entity42 @entity14 's players celebrate the victory in front of their delirious fans at the @entity13 @entity62 ( centre ) , @entity64 ( left ) and @entity73 trudge off after the humbling defeat video disappointed @entity81 bemoans counter-attacks			1

@entity4 scored the opening goal for @entity14 after a solo run which started inside his own half
@entity33 rounded @entity62 to score a second early in the second half
@entity74 missed three good chances for @entity10 as they looked to equalised
@entity355 got worse for @entity81 when @entity71 *twisted* his right ankle late on
@entity14 belied their status as second seeds and made @entity10 look anything but a ' @entity22 ' team
