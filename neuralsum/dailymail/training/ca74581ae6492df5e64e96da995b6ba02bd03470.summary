@entity2 defended the steep hike in cost - up from 46p to 60p for first class and 36p to 50p for second class - saying they would still be half the price of posting letters in @entity16			1
the prices were some of the lowest in @entity19 and had not kept pace with inflation , and the core business was still losing money , she said			0
the announcement of the huge increase , the biggest since 1975 , prompted a stampede , with one customer ordering 10,000 second - class as panic buying spread			0
@entity3 even rationed stamps , prompting growing anger			1
however , ms @entity2 - whose total pay for her first nine months , including her salary , bonus ( of £ 142,000 ) , benefits and pension , was reported last year to be £ 777,611 - told the annual conference of the @entity40 that the company faces a ' spiral of decline ' unless conditions are imposed on competitors planning to deliver post			1
ms @entity2 voiced strong concerns about the impact of unregulated competition , which the @entity3 believes poses a huge risk to the six - day - a - week , one - price - goes - anywhere universal service			1
she became the first @entity3 chief executive to address the annual conference , warning that competition for so - called end - to - end deliveries is an ' immediate threat '			1
rival firm @entity57 has launched a trial delivery service in west @entity59 following a previous trial in @entity61 , saying it wanted to roll out a broader service			0
rising : the price of stamps is to go up next week from 46p to 60p for first class and 36p to 50p for second class ms @entity2 told today 's conference in @entity68 : ' i am fearful that competition , if it does not have conditions imposed , will soon begin a spiral of decline in @entity3 that will be very difficult to staunch			1
' she warned the union that @entity3 faced ' hard years ' ahead , highlighting fears that if firms were able to compete in the more profitable parts of the business , other parts would become more expensive to service			1
ms @entity2 said @entity3 had become an ' easy target ' for criticism as she urged people to stop treating the company as a ' spectator sport '			1
she told delegates that when she took over from previous chief executive @entity88 21 months ago , @entity3 was effectively bankrupt and had to operate under a regulatory regime under which there was ' no way ' it could be successful			1
the firm was cash negative , pensions were in jeopardy and officials were telling her it could run out of cash within four months			0
' it was scary , ' she said , detailing some of the changes that have been made in recent years , including the loss of 5,400 jobs last year , taking the total to 50,000 in the past decade			0
sorted : but the daily postbag is now less than 60 million compared with 84 million in 2006 ' this is still a very difficult time for @entity3			1
this is a great company which has struggled for over a decade from chronic under - investment			0
' ms @entity2 added that at a time of ' economic turmoil ' in the country , with fewer letters being posted , it was ' amazing ' that the regulatory regime was allowing increases in the capacity for sorting post			1
in a question and answer session later , ms @entity2 faced anger over the planned privatisation of @entity3 , with one delegate saying private firms would only be interested in profits , rather than quality of service or the pay and conditions of workers			1
ms @entity2 said @entity3 needed a lot of capital in the next five years and questioned the success of the company being owned by the government			1
' i am not sure that government ownership has been as great as you think it might have been , ' she said , pointing out the level of job losses and regulatory regime she believes has held back the company			2
she added that many parts of the government do not even use @entity3			1
government ownership was not a panacea for future success , she told delegates , continuing : ' if we do not beat the competitors , we will not be successful , regardless of who owns the company			2
' we need profits to continue to have good , secure employment and all the technology we need to be a successful company			0
' ' it 's clear that the more delivery work which is done by private companies , the less there will be for @entity3 , and core services could suffer with higher prices and lower service standards			2
' we do n't want a race to the bottom in the postal industry - we want secure , quality jobs with recognised trade union representation			0
' competition and privatisation bring uncertainty for everyone in the industry , as the pursuit of profit comes before services to the public			0

the amount of mail posted has fallen by 25 per cent in the past five years , with the daily postbag now less than 60 million compared with 84 million in 2006			1
ms @entity2 received polite applause from delegates to her speech			2
@entity3 has warned that @entity57 's pilot service underlines the fact that competitors can ' cherry - pick ' the most profitable , high population density routes , leaving @entity3 to deliver to unprofitable areas			2
the move also raises the prospect of competitors being allowed to deliver fewer than six days a week , said @entity3			2
@entity175 , deputy general secretary of the @entity40 , said : ' @entity57 's end - to - end deliveries are the obvious next step in postal competition , but we fear this could lead to downgrading of services and jobs across the industry			0
' we share many of @entity3 's concerns about how this will affect the universal service and deliveries for everyone			2
' it 's clear that the more delivery work which is done by private companies , the less there will be for @entity3 , and core services could suffer with higher prices and lower service standards			2
' we do n't want a race to the bottom in the postal industry - we want secure , quality jobs with recognised trade union representation			0
