by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 's two largest ice sheets are now dumping an ' incredible ' 120 cubic miles of ice into the oceans each year			1
this is equal to an ice layer 1,970ft ( 600 metres ) thick that would stretch over an area half the size of @entity13 , researchers claim			1
overall , the rate of ice loss from the @entity16 has doubled			2
meanwhile the rate of volume loss from the @entity19 has tripled since 2009			0
the team has produced elevation models for the ice sheets			0
in @entity25 , the volume of ice loss is about 31 cubic miles ( 128 cubic km ) per year and thinning is concentrated in the area of the @entity29 the discovery was made using the first ever maps of elevation changes in @entity33 and @entity35 glaciers created by the @entity37 satellite			1
a team at @entity39 , @entity40 for @entity41 and @entity42 used two years ' of data collected by @entity37 in 2012 and 2013			0
they were then able to build 14 million individual height measurements of glaciers for @entity16 and another 200 million for @entity25			1
the maps reveal that @entity16 is now losing about 90 cubic miles ( 375 cubic km ) of ice each year			1
in @entity25 , the volume of ice loss is about 31 cubic miles ( 128 cubic km ) per year and thinning is concentrated in the area of the @entity29			1
the rate of ice loss from the @entity16 has doubled ( right ) , and the rate of volume loss from the @entity19 ( left ) has tripled since 2009			2
pictured above are the surface slopes of the ice sheets the maps reveal that @entity16 is now losing about 90 cubic miles ( 375 cubic km ) of ice each year			1
the discovery was made using the first ever maps of elevation changes in @entity33 and @entity35 glaciers however , some thickening has been seen in the @entity65 , where colossal snowfalls have been reported			1
the scientists claim , however , that this snow fall is not enough to offset the losses in @entity25			2
' the contribution of both ice sheets together to sea level rise has doubled since 2009 , ' said @entity73 from @entity74 's @entity39			0
' to us , that 's an incredible number , ' she told @entity77 at @entity78			0
@entity37 was launched in 2010 and uses a radar instrument to measure the shape of polar ice surfaces			1
' the new elevation maps are snapshots of the current state of the ice sheets , added dr @entity86 , glaciologist at the @entity39 in @entity25 , the volume of ice loss is about 31 cubic miles ( 128 cubic km ) per year and thinning is concentrated in the area of the @entity29 ' the elevations are very accurate , to just a few metres in height , and cover close to 3.8 million miles2 ( 16 million km2 ) of the area of the ice sheets			1
' launched in 2010 , @entity37 carries a radar altimeter that can ' see ' through clouds and in the dark , providing continuous measurements over areas like @entity25			2
the radar can measure the surface height variation of ice in fine detail , allowing scientists to record changes in its volume with unprecedented accuracy			2
' although we are fortunate to now have , in @entity110 , a routine capability to monitor the polar ice sheets , the increased thinning we have detected in @entity25 is a worrying development			1
' said professor @entity113 , of the @entity115			0
' it adds concrete evidence that dramatic changes are underway in this part of our planet , which has enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than a metre [ 3.3 feet ]			0
' a flourishing ecosystem has been found a mile and a half beneath @entity35 ice in a lake cut off from the outside world for millions of years			2
the discovery was made by @entity132 scientists who found tiny organisms that generate energy for growth from the natural ammonium and methane in the environment			0
this is the first direct evidence that life can be found deep below the @entity35 ice sheet and could have implications for finding life in extreme environments in our solar system			0
' we were able to prove unequivocally to the world that @entity25 is not a dead continent , â€™ said lead scientist professor @entity150 , from @entity151			0
many of the organisms found belong to a primitive extended family of microbes , distinct from bacteria , called the @entity157			0
archaea form one of the three great ' domains ' of life on @entity3 , the other two being bacteria and eukayotes - organisms with their @entity163 contained in a cell nucleus - to which humans belong .			0

@entity16 and @entity25 are dumping 120 cubic miles of ice each year
this is equal to *1970ft* ice layer that would stretch over half of @entity13
maps of changes in @entity33 and @entity35 glaciers created by @entity37
@entity37 satellite uses a radar to measure the shape of polar ice surfaces
some thickening from snowfall has been seen in the @entity65
but this snowfall is not enough to offset the losses in @entity25
