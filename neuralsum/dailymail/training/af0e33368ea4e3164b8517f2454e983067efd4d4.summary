by @entity0 @entity1 has insisted that his sudden decision to quit this winter ’s @entity4 tour was due to physical and mental burnout , rather than depression			1
he admits , however , that the stress of the trip led to repeat headaches , and to him hiding away from his team - mates at breakfast while being unsure about how he would feel when travelling to the ground			0
after getting home , he feared that people might view him as a ‘ nutcase ’			1
in a @entity20 documentary to be broadcast on sunday evening , the @entity18 batsman differentiates his case from that of @entity23 , and he emphasises that he wants to resume his international career as soon as possible this summer			1
video : scroll down for @entity1 on the @entity4 and a comeback mental burnout : @entity1 's face tells the story after he was dismissed by @entity30 at @entity31 a weight off his mind : @entity1 revealed the reason behind his decision to quit the @entity4 tour on @entity20 focused on a return : @entity1 wants to resume his international career this summer admission : @entity1 says he was consumed by guilt watching his @entity18 colleagues struggle without him giving what is his first account of the circumstances that saw him fly home after november ’s first test in @entity47 , he concedes that he was consumed by guilt watching his colleagues struggle when back in @entity18			1
nonetheless , he is convinced that he did the right thing by leaving @entity51 , after a recurrence of feelings he has experienced before			1
‘ i knew i was n’t helping anyone by being there , i would have been a passenger basically , ’ he tells interviewer @entity54			1
‘ i was trying everything to get myself in the right frame of mind to contribute , i was working hard in the nets , but emotionally it was hard to keep myself in check			0
‘ just coming down to breakfast i ’d sit on my own , away from the guys with my cap over my head , because i did n’t know how i was going to react to having to go to the cricket ground again			0
’ he states that the brief gap between unprecedented back - to - back @entity4 contributed to the condition building up			2
although he does not blame anybody , there is the implicit suggestion that the players were pushed too hard , given the highly unusual schedule			0
face facts ; the relentlessness of the international schedule contributed to @entity1 's exhaustion opening up : @entity1 spoke to @entity54 in an exclusive interview with @entity20 nothing left to give : @entity1 spoons the ball to deep square leg in the second innings at @entity31 and ( right ) walks off despondent after giving his wicket away ‘ you end up going back to your room and it ’s difficult			1
you feel sort of hopeless , it ’s the opposite end of the spectrum to how it felt three years ago or at the beginning of the @entity93 summer			0
it built up through the end of the ashes in @entity18 , through the @entity97			1
the three weeks in between was n’t time off because i was working hard in the nets			0
‘ it was pretty relentless , getting to @entity51 a month before the first test , and i think we had two days off before the first test			1
‘ i tried my hardest and ended up finding out myself that i had nothing left to give			0
it was very difficult for me to operate close to 100 per cent or even 50 per cent of what i was capable of			0
i did n’t have the emotional energy or the mental energy to get out there			2
throughout ( last ) summer i was getting to 40 and 50 and i just could n’t watch the ball as hard as i normally do			0
‘ even in the @entity4 series in @entity18 there were times , especially towards the end of the series , when i just had a headache for three or four days , just constantly in a bad place really			1
i remember driving from @entity117 to @entity118 for the fourth test , it ’s normally quite a nice drive and i just was n’t feeling right			2
i was just constantly thinking about cricket			0
’ headache : @entity1 admits that even in the winning @entity4 series in the summer he found it duifficult could n't switch off : @entity1 admits he was ' constantly thinking about cricket ' during the summer matters did not improve in @entity51 , and he recognised that there was a problem			1
‘ going to the cricket ground was quite hard to do , keeping emotionally intact and in the right frame of mind			0
starting at the end of @entity133 and @entity134 ( @entity4 warm - up matches ) it was getting to that point , and then i realised at @entity47 because of the scrutiny of five @entity138 matches i was n’t going to be in the right space			0
’ he is sure that his condition was different to that of @entity23 , who similarly departed an @entity142 seven years previously			1
‘ i spoke to @entity23 and he wanted to know how i was			1
there are a lot of similarities people can probably draw from it , i understand people thinking it but it ’s a completely different situation			2
. we were both very upset and confused but also at the same time very different			0
‘ in @entity47 i spoke to the @entity151 and on one of the last nights he said , " you know , if i was a gp i ’d sign you off for three weeks from work and say come back and see me in three weeks ’ time " , but we ’re on an @entity4 tour and you ca n’t do that , so i did n’t have anywhere to go really			2
not a factor : @entity1 says he was ' already out ' by the time @entity163 made his comments , but the added that he ' did n't have the mental energy to fight it ' it all felt the same : @entity1 concedes people may think @entity30 's bowling helped send him home but insists it did not matter who was bowling , or how quickly ‘ i remember day two or three ( of @entity47 ) , it was a bit of a blur			1
i was getting headaches and i was n’t eating properly towards the end , and that ’s when the sleep started getting disruptive and emotionally that was when i was worst and it just boiled over really			0
i had nothing left in the tank or battery – mentally and physically pretty drained			0
’ he is insistent that @entity163 ’s derogatory comments in @entity47 were not a factor , and nor was the full frontal assault of @entity30			1
of @entity163 ’s comments he responds : ‘ no , i was already out so it did n’t make a difference			1
those sort of things do n’t really bother me , ’ although he then adds : ‘ i did n’t have the mental energy to fight it			2
’ on @entity30 , he concedes that observers will put two and two together and conclude that the paceman helped send him home : ‘ i ’m sure people will think that , and people have said it , but to me it did n’t matter who was bowling and that ’s the hardest part to accept			1
it does n’t matter if it was 100mph , 90mph or 60 mph , it all felt pretty much the same			0
’ the rock : @entity1 has been @entity18 's calming influence at @entity202 for five years there was clearly a feeling of release immediately he left @entity51 , although after that it became difficult to watch from afar , with concerns about how the public would perceive him			1
‘ leaving @entity47 , i flew to @entity209			0
i ’ve never slept on a plane , but as it took off i slept for eight hours straight			0
it was really weird , i woke up in @entity209 and the news was about to break in @entity51 so it was really strange			1
and then the guys walked out at @entity215 and things did n’t go well and a feeling of guilt started kicking in			2
that was the hardest thing , for me to be in contact with the guys and them thinking he ’s at home with the central heating on and watching it on tv			2
‘ i was a little bit worried about going out in public because people look at you and you do n’t know what they are thinking			2
" there goes that nutcase " or whatever , and you ’re not quite sure what perceptions are			2
people come up to you and say , " it ’s good to see you out and about " and i ’m like , " i ’m not crazy i was just burnt out "			2
’ different : @entity1 says his case was not the same as that of @entity23 , who left the 2006 - 07 @entity4 tour after suffering from depression while pledging that he wants to come back , and wants to tour again , he admits that this was not the first time he has experienced such a state of mind			1
‘ i ’ve never really spoken about it but on my first tour i went to @entity245 and i had probably a little bit similar feeling towards the end – it was a 10 - week tour and i ’d never been away and i ended up having not a disaster … but at the wanderers i was n’t feeling great			0
' i learnt from that mistake for the next couple of years but probably got myself in a similar spiral and situation in the last couple of months before i had a break			0
’ @entity1 reaffirms that he is targeting @entity259 ’s match against @entity260 at the start of next month as his comeback , and that he wants to get straight back into the @entity18 set up when the international treadmill cranks up again			1
bear necessities : @entity1 will play for @entity259 in their friendly against @entity260 next month ‘ i know there ’s a @entity268 game at the beginning of may			1
i think that would be a good game to get back into the mix , and then at the end of the month there ’s @entity275			0
i do n’t want to be one of those cricketers that picks and chooses , i want to be available from the word go			0
' i remember almost to the day six weeks after i got back thinking that if i had to go out and bat now at @entity47 six weeks later i ’d feel a lot more confident than i did when i actually played			0
‘ i ’ll probably be under a cloud for a bit , " he left an @entity4 tour , is he going to be ok ? " i think as long as i ’m feeling ok with myself and where my game ’s at i think playing international cricket is fine , there ’s obviously scrutiny but it ’s how i feel about my own game and how i feel going forward			0
’ * watch the full programme @entity1 : burn out , on sunday march 16 at 7pm on @entity20 1			1

@entity1 's sudden decision to leave @entity51 after the first test was down to physical and mental burnout , not depression
batsman feared people back in @entity18 would view him as a ' nutcase '
@entity1 insists his case is different from @entity23 's
he was consumed by guilt watching @entity18 struggle without him
however , @entity1 insists he ' would have been a passenger ' if he *'d* stayed
@entity163 's comments and @entity30 's pace ' were not factors '
@entity1 wants to play again for @entity18 ' as soon as possible '
