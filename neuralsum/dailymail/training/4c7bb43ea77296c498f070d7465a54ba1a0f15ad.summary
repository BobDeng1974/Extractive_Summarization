a petition has now been started by students , and the culprits , to have the librarian reinstated as she was ' not in the position to stop it '			1
ms @entity0 was working there that night but had nothing to do with organising the event and had not been asked if it could go ahead			1
in the video , posted on @entity15 , a group of around 30 students are shown studying quietly in the grand surroundings of @entity37 's			1
then a youngster dressed as an @entity24 footballer is seen dancing before the film cuts to all the students doing the @entity6 craze in fancy dress			2

at @entity37 's @entity96 weekly meeting , students passed a motion calling for the immediate reinstatement of the librarian			0
as a result of the vote the @entity96 president @entity102 is to ' ask for a written reason for the decision from the @entity105 , and also to bring the matter to the attention of the governing body , calling in the strongest terms for @entity79 to be rehired			0
' battle : students at @entity37 's ( pictured ) have started a petition to have miss @entity0 reinstated as she was powerless to stop it miss @entity102 will also be writing to the @entity67 to seek the fines imposed being overturned because ' the @entity115 did not cause a disturbance coming as it did at 11:30 pm on a sunday evening - and that the event - only lasted roughly seven minutes			1
' @entity118 , a student at @entity37 's , said : ' the situation seems ridiculous			0
' @entity120 had nothing to do with the protest ; she just happened to be there at the time			0
' another @entity37 's student said of @entity79 's sacking : ' she was not in a position to stop them at the time ' @entity96 secretary @entity130 said : ' we are not trying to deliberately undermine any decisions made by college authorities , but we , and the rest of the @entity96 , believe that the dismissal of the librarian in question was unfair			0
