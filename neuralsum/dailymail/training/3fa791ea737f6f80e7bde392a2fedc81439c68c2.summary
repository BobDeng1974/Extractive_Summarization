@entity0 will be at @entity1 on saturday aiming to pen a footballing fairytale with a @entity5 team chasing a first @entity7 victory since 1980			1
but it ’s not that long ago the 41 - year - old was dreaming of the silver screen and not silverware after co-writing a pilot episode of a ribald sitcom called @entity13			1
@entity0 ’s younger brother , @entity14 - a tiler to trade - played the lead role of @entity16 , a working - class @entity17 player catapulted into a world of wags and money after joining a fictional @entity23 club			1
@entity5 manager @entity0 ( right ) holds the @entity7 ahead of the weekend @entity5 will face @entity24 in the semi-final of the @entity7 at @entity1 this weekend @entity26 , who starred in @entity27 and @entity28 , played the manager while @entity31 actor @entity30 - who co-wrote the project - portrayed the chairman			1
nine episodes were drafted in total by @entity0 in 2011 in the twilight of his playing days before he went on to manage @entity37 and then @entity5			1
drawing heavily on his playing career with @entity40 , @entity41 and this weekend ’s opponents @entity24 , the pilot was never picked up by a television studio			1
however , screen - writing remains a hobby of @entity0 ’s to this day - and even if @entity13 had been a roaring success he still does n’t believe it would have taken him off the path that led towards saturday ’s last - four clash			1
‘ if @entity13 had been picked up would i be sitting here today ? absolutely , yes , ’ said the 41 - year - old boss with a smile			1
‘ i did all that before i started on my coaching badges			2
i was doing it as a book			2
a lot of former players do biographies or autobiographies and it was kind of my way of doing certain things in a certain way			0
i do n’t believe you can do a biography without hurting people ! not if you want to be honest , anyway			0
@entity0 co-wrote the pilot episode of a sitcom named @entity13 before becoming a coach ‘ it was just a side track , for me			1
but it ’s something i might go back to			0
i have gathered a lot more material since then			0
i ’ve certainly dealt with a lot more characters ! ‘ i still write little notes here and there to this day , as i did as a player			0
but i do n’t sit down and write scripts just now , no. ’ with his ability to pen dialogue , is @entity0 ever tempted to write and perform a churchillian speech before a big match like this one at @entity1 ? ‘ i do n’t script my team - talks , no , ’ he said			1
‘ everything i do or say to the players before a game or at half - time has not been written down			2
the stuff i do n’t remember from matches i do n’t see as important			2
‘ instead , i do little team - talks , speaking to each player individually or to small groups of players			1
when i was a player , a manager would go through the whole team on the tactics board			2
‘ but if he was talking to defence alone , the midfield and forwards did n’t have his attention			0
they ’d be looking at their boots			0
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity24 boss @entity101 ( right ) stand with the cup at @entity1 ‘ so i try to get it so i ’ve got their attention and i know they ’re listening			1
whether it ’s the two full - backs and who they ’re up against , or how the striker or strikers should be moving up front			2
it ’s just the way i like to do it			0
whether that ’s right or wrong , who knows ? ’ for @entity0 , the manager ’s office at @entity119 has emerged as his very own @entity120 , or certainly one in need of a psychiatrist ’s couch			1
because his team could be said to suffer from a split personality			2
a thrilling attacking unit they may be , but after beating @entity41 they ’re just as likely to lose to @entity129 ; or dish out an historic 6 - 2 thumping to fierce rivals @entity131 and then draw at @entity37 or with lowly @entity132			2
in his role as manager and amateur psychologist , @entity0 - who won four leagues , and each domestic cup three times at @entity41 - is trying to weed out the fear he believes hampers his side ’s performances			1
it ’s one that presents a clear and present danger to @entity146 dreams of winning the @entity7 for the first time in 35 years			1
he said : ‘ for me , the biggest thing is the mental side of it , the expectation and the fear			0
there ’s a difference between expectation and actually being able to handle it			0
‘ when we drew with @entity132 recently , i felt fear and negativity in our play			0
we were in good positions and the ball ended up back at our goalkeeper			0
@entity5 players celebrates after @entity167 ( hidden ) scored against bitter rivals @entity131 ‘ when i came in two years ago , we could not win at home			1
we ’d only won two games in the first bit of the season until we won at home to @entity174 in my first match			0
‘ now we ’re winning most of our matches at home but struggling at times away from home			2
it ’s about trying to create an environment where there is no change playing home or away			0
and that , i believe , is about mentality			0
‘ it ’s about getting the balance between fear and expectation right			0
we need to handle it and be positive			0
for instance , our younger players have not experienced that ( fear )			0
they do n’t think about expectation			0
they just go out and play like normal			0
it ’s what i want to see			0
’ despite their mental frailties , @entity0 points out that his team still have a tendency to rise to the big occasion			1
as such , he rates saturday ’s match with an @entity24 side unbeaten in their last nine games as being too close to call			1
‘ we ’ve handled the big games well , ’ said @entity0 , who is set to hand former @entity204 defender @entity203 a debut to remember against the @entity24			1
( from left ) @entity41 's @entity207 , @entity174 ' @entity208 , @entity210 managing director @entity209 , @entity24 's @entity101 and @entity5 's @entity0 stand and pose with the @entity7 at @entity1 ‘ but we ’ve been in winning positions against @entity37 and @entity129 and dropped crucial points which have cost us in terms of our league position			1
‘ we dropped five points in those games and another two at @entity132 but we have nine wins out of 11 at home			0
@entity24 are the only team to beat us at @entity119 this season			1
‘ @entity24 have had a terrific season so far and they ’ve done consistently well , especially when it comes to not conceding			2
‘ but we ’re just three points behind them and i believe we ’ve done well to hang in there with them			0
on saturday , it will all be down to whoever does better on the day			2
’ @entity0 ’s screenwriting days may be temporarily behind him - but he has n’t given up on scripting some happy endings with @entity5 .			1

@entity5 face @entity24 in @entity7 on saturday

@entity5 boss co-wrote a pilot of sitcom named @entity13
but @entity0 says he does ' not script ' his team - talks before matches
