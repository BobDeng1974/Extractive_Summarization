up from the deep : an extremely rare species of shark has been discovered off the @entity2 tiny teeth : however , this little critter is more likely to get you cooing than crying out in fear the first pocket shark was found 36 years ago in the @entity27 off the coast of @entity29 and it 's been sitting in a @entity31 museum since			1
it 's believed the newly - discovered pocket shark was just a few weeks old as he is extremely small and only weighs a mere half ounce			1
strangely , this type of shark has two pockets next to its front fins ; their purpose is not known			2
it 's not quite like a kangaroo , which uses its pouch to carry young , but few species have pockets this large - about 4 percent of the shark 's body			1

a couple of times , the lab with the freezer lost power			0
once identified , the shark was shipped to @entity103 and @entity104 for high - tech examinations that would n't puncture the specimen			2
dissection : the truly strange thing about this species strange is its twin pockets - while no one knows what they are for , some experts believe that they may secrete some kind of glowing fluid or pheromones the shark also has unusual belly patches not seen in most sharks			2
the only other pocket shark was a female adult about 17 inches long ; it is believed that adult females may be larger than males			1
but the truly strange thing about this species strange is its twin pockets			0
while no one knows what they are for , based on the @entity31 specimen @entity86 and @entity50 speculated that they may secrete some kind of glowing fluid or pheromones			1
