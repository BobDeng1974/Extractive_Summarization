mr @entity17 added he received the information in a letter from ms @entity28 ’s lawyer			0

mr @entity2 told @entity74 : ‘ this has a bad smell about it and looks like some sort of @entity6 attempt to cover over the truth of what really happened			1
‘ the public is being misled about what the most senior person in the @entity6 knew about @entity10 when the @entity6 were running tribute programmes and keeping evidence of @entity10 ’s crimes under wraps			2
’ a @entity6 spokeswoman said : ‘ we made clear to @entity2 mp that he should raise his concerns with @entity17 , as a first step			1
