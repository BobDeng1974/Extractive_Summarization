ten @entity4 universities are selling @entity6 meat , where animals are not stunned before they are slaughtered - without telling consumers			1
pictured , chickens after ritual slaughter in a @entity6 abattoir in @entity25 , @entity26 the findings were unearthed through a @entity29 request which was sent to 126 establisments			1
but just 25 responded - meaning the problem could be more widespread than currently thought			1
the news comes after it was revealed last week that leading restaurants were serving @entity6 meat without informing their customers			1
halal meat comes from animals which have had their cuts slit while still alive , in accordance with @entity40 traditions			2
but some animals are not stunned beforehand , leaving them in pain			0
now - according to student newspaper @entity47 - nearly half of the universities that responded to the request are serving @entity6 meat without making students aware			1
@entity49 - one of the top universities which has admitted serving up @entity6 meat on the quiet at @entity54 , 70 per cent of the meat served is unlabelled @entity6 while at @entity18 and @entity19 , all the chicken is served @entity6 - style , but is not labelled as so			1
@entity56 and @entity57 were also found to be among the universities serving significant quantities of the meat , without telling consumers			1
of the 35 @entity63 colleges that responded to the @entity65 request , only two did not serve any @entity6 meat , according to the paper			1
@entity10 @entity11 @entity68 @entity69 @entity70 @entity71 @entity72 @entity54 @entity73 @entity74 and when the suppliers were contacted to see if they supplied stunned or unstunned meat , many suppliers did not know			1
a spokesman for meat supplier 3663 , which serves @entity54 and @entity80 , said : ' currently , we do not collect information on the method of slaughter			2
' fears over the correct labelling of @entity6 meat came to light earlier this month when it was revealed several leading chains were serving the meat to unsuspecting customers			1
@entity93 was one leading chain which had decided to secretly swap meat for @entity6 products , while @entity96 was exposed for failing to inform consumers that some food they were purchasing contained halal			1
it was also revealed that leading supermarkets are selling @entity102 lamb killed in accordance with halal ritual without providing labels			1
the @entity106 condemned this method of non-stunned slaughter and the unethical practice of non-labelling being carried out at several @entity4 universities			1
a spokesperson said : ' scientific research has clearly shown that slaughter of an animal without stunning can cause unnecessary suffering , and so we are opposed to the slaughter of any animal without first making it insensible to pain and distress			2
' ' our concern has nothing to do with the expression of religious belief but with the practice of killing by throat cutting without pre-stunning			0
universities should only be serving meat that is stunned prior to slaughter			1
' we are calling for labelling to refer to stun or non-stun slaughter rather than a method of ‘ religious ’ slaughter			0
' 85 per cent of the meat served at the @entity11 was unlabelled @entity6 meat , according to the @entity65 requests this call for change in current legislation is being championed by the @entity142			1
president @entity143 said : ' @entity142 is campaigning for an end to the practice of non-stun slaughter which compromises animal welfare at the time of death			2
' we would like to see all universities taking a proactive approach on animal welfare and only sourcing their meat from abattoirs that pre-stun before slaughter			1
' @entity156 , president of the @entity157 , said : ' the fact that students are consuming non-stun meat without their knowledge is appalling			2
' while non-stun slaughter continues it is absolutely imperative for students to be able to make choices based on both religious and animal welfare grounds			2
' @entity68 is one of the ten universities which admitted secretly serving @entity6 meat to their customers			1
the news comes after it emerged some supermarkets and restaurants were not labelling their halal meat a spokesman for @entity73 said : ' we work closely with all of our suppliers to source high - quality ingredients to serve our customers			1
' there is no legal requirement for @entity6 meat to be labelled			1
however , two of our suppliers - @entity180 and @entity182 - label all products where they contain halal meat ingredients			2
' we continue to work with our suppliers to make all labelling as clear and informative as possible for our customers			0
' a @entity11 spokesman said : ' the university uses a well - established local catering butcher and a large @entity4 - based catering company to supply its meat and food products containing meat			2
' the proportion of @entity6 meat served on campus is indicative of how the animal was slaughtered but we only label products as @entity6 if they have been transported , stored and prepared according to @entity40 dietary laws			1
' there is no national certification scheme for halal and meat slaughtered in a way that complies with @entity40 dietary laws is consumed widely across the @entity4			0
for example , chicken used in packaged sandwiches is commonly slaughtered according to @entity6 standards , as often is @entity102 lamb			2
' the @entity6 meat market in the @entity4 is worth around £ 2.6billion per year and is still expected to soar the @entity6 meat market in the @entity4 is worth around £ 2.6billion a year – and it is expected to soar			1
earlier this month , it was revealed that @entity93 has removed ham and bacon from almost 200 fast food outlets and switched to halal meat alternatives in an attempt to please its @entity217 customers			2
@entity223 ‘ ham ’ and turkey rashers will be used instead in 185 of its stores , where all the meat will now be prepared according to @entity6 rules			2
the chain , which has around 1,500 outlets across the @entity4 , explained its decision by saying it had to balance animal welfare concerns with ‘ the views of religious communities ’			0
traditional @entity6 slaughter has animals having their throats slit before bleeding to death			1
in @entity236 the word @entity6 means ‘ permitted ’ or ‘ lawful ’ and defines anything that is allowed or lawful according to the @entity238			2
it is often used to indicate food – particularly meat – that has been prepared in accordance with @entity217 principles and techniques			0
in @entity4 , killing an animal without prior stunning is illegal , but the law gives special exemption to @entity217 and @entity249 meat producers on the grounds of religion			2
in the @entity4 there are thought to be around 12 abattoirs dedicated to unstunned slaughter , while hundreds practise stunned halal slaughter			0
muslims are forbidden from eating any @entity259 food and meat from pigs and @entity93 said customers can identify those stores selling halal food by the special ‘ all meats are halal ’ sign , which must be displayed in participating branches			0
halal refers to any object or action which is ' permissible ' according to @entity40 law			0
the term covers not only food and drink but also matters of daily life			0
halal foods are those that @entity217 are allowed to eat or drink under @entity40 @entity278			0
the criteria dictates both food which are allowed and how the food must be prepared			0
the foods most commonly addressed are types of meat and animal tissue			0
the most common example of non-halal , or forbidden food is pork			0
it is the only meat that must not be eaten by @entity217 at all , due to historical , cultural and religiously perceived hygienic concerns			0
other meats can be forbidden , depending on their source , the cause of the animal 's death and how it was processed			0
to be halal , the food must have come from a supplier that uses halal practises			0
specifically the slaughter must be performed by a muslim , who must invoke the name of @entity305 prior to killing the animal			0
commonly a person will say ' @entity308 ' ( ' @entity308 ' ) before repeating ' @entity309 ' ( ' @entity310 is the greatest ' ) three times			0
the animal is then slaughtered with a sharp knife , by cutting the throat , windpipe and blood vessels in the neck without cutting the spinal cord			0
the blood must then be drained from its veins			0
traditionally and according to @entity40 scholars , an animal must be conscious while slaughtered			0
however the majority of halal abattoirs stun the animals before killing them			0
muslims must also ensure that all foods , particularly processed foods , as well as non-food items like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals , are halal			0
the opposite of halal is ' haraam ' , meaning forbidden .			0
