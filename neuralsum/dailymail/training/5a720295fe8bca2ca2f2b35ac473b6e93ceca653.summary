department store @entity3 , which is owned by its staff , was named the overall winner , climbing from second position into the coveted first - place slot			1
consumers praised the company for its service and the quality of its products , as well as its overall integrity as a brand			1

and one iconic @entity15 brand managed to make something of a breakthrough this year – with @entity54 rising from 165th to 14th place in the table			2
historically , the company was known for its redcoats and a rather cheap and cheerful approach to hospitality			0
however its owners have spent millions developing new upmarket hotels and apartments , to make it a competitor to the likes of @entity67			0
@entity42 director @entity68 explained that @entity33 had been tarnished by its decision not to make a bigger contribution to public services in the @entity15 this year			2

’ he added : ‘ unquestionably , there is a bit of an aura around @entity3			2
the fact that it is owned by its employees has given it a halo effect			0
‘ customers have a feeling that the staff try that bit harder and make an extra effort , so they view it as a brand that they can trust			1
’ small @entity15 companies to win plaudits included the online wine retailer @entity124 , founded by @entity125 in 1969 and the cheap mobile phone tariff provider @entity126 , founded by @entity129 graduate @entity128			0
mr @entity68 said : ‘ these are brands that are both @entity15 , but are also identifiable by their owners			0
