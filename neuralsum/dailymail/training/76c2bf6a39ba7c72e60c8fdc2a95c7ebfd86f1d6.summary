@entity0 is a big number at @entity2			2
larger still is the amount of money the club have spent pursuing it			0
since @entity8 won @entity2 ’s ninth @entity9 in 2002 , the cash sprayed across the continent chasing no 10 has totalled an astonishing £ 999million			1
that , of course , includes two players bought for £ 80m or more in @entity13 and @entity14 and three times breaking the world record transfer fee ( twice in one summer )			1
cheques were written for the best and the rest at an average of £ 83.5m per year			0
in for £ 13.4m came @entity42 , who scored an own goal and received a red card on his debut ; in for £ 22.8m came @entity46 , last seen getting relegated with @entity47 ; in for £ 11.5m came @entity48 , who scored twice in 24 appearances for @entity50 this season			0
big money : @entity2 spent £ 80m on their star man @entity13 in 2009 brilliant orange : @entity2 topped the @entity13 transfer with the £ 86m signing of @entity14 in the summer flashing the cash : @entity2 spent big in 2009 , signing @entity58 ( left ) for £ 56m and @entity59 for £ 25m yet there was also @entity58 at £ 56m , once world footballer of the year ; there was @entity59 at £ 25m , one of the most sought - after young strikers in @entity66 ; and , at £ 39.6m , there was @entity69 ronaldo , the first player bought after @entity2 ’ s last @entity71 triumph			1
the most outlandish splurge came in 2009/10 when more than £ 220m was spent as @entity13 joined from @entity73 , @entity58 from @entity74 , and @entity59 from @entity75			1
despite all this the furthest the club had progressed in the @entity9 in 11 seasons prior to this season was the semi-finals			1
for six straight years they failed to get beyond the last - 16			0
that is an astonishing feat when you count the number of @entity9 winners ’ medals amassed by players either before or after their stay at the @entity89			2
icon : @entity91 moved from @entity73 to @entity2 for a fee of £ 25.5m saving not spending : @entity93 was a rare free transfer for the @entity96 side in 2007 @entity91 won with @entity73 before he joined in 2003			1
@entity97 did it with @entity99 in 2005 before moving to @entity2 four years later			2
@entity101 and @entity102 were both shifted on in the summer of 2009 after the arrivals of @entity13 and @entity58 as @entity2 searched for that elusive breakthrough			2
they could have looked closer to home			0
@entity101 went on to lift the @entity9 that season with @entity107 , while @entity102 scored the winning goal in the final for @entity110 last may			0
in total @entity2 have had nine @entity9 winners on their playing staff in the last 12 barren years , almost a full starting xi – including wobbly - legs himself @entity116			1
@entity117 had won the @entity118 with @entity119 the summer before he signed but was unable to bring the biggest piece of club silverware to @entity2			0
were they to beat city rivals @entity124 and claim their 10th @entity9 , the exorbitant cost would still be questioned – but it would then become an afterthought as celebrations began			0
