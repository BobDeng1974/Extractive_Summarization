by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:34 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 11:20 est , 26 july 2012 the @entity4 flag blunder which sparked a diplomatic row has been blamed on a video producer in @entity7 , it was reported today			1
@entity9 's women footballers walked off in protest before their match with @entity12 yesterday when the flag of bitter rivals @entity15 was mistakenly shown on the big screen in @entity18 's @entity17			1
the @entity9 were only persuaded to play the match an hour later once the foul - up had been rectified			1
@entity17 organisers had no input in the video , which introduced @entity9 's side by showing a @entity23 player and flag , according to @entity49			1
@entity50 has refused to name the person responsible , but the official in question has since offered their resignation , according to the @entity55			1
games organisers have issued an apology over the incident , while prime minster @entity59 today said it was an ' honest mistake '			2
not a good start : @entity9 return to play after players walked off the pitch back on the pitch : the @entity4 women 's soccer team poses for a photograph before the group b match between @entity12 and @entity9 @entity68 : the @entity4 team did eventually take to the field after the right flag was displayed in action : @entity9 's @entity73 controls the ball against @entity12 's @entity75 , captain @entity76 and @entity77 shock result : @entity9 's players celebrate after winning 2 - 0 against @entity12 speaking on a visit to the @entity81 , mr @entity59 said : ' this was an honest mistake , honestly made , an apology has been made and i 'm sure every step will be taken to make sure these things do n't happen again			1
' we should n't over-inflate this episode			0
it was unfortunate , it should n't have happened and i think we can leave it at that			0
' @entity9 went on to win the warm - up match 2 - 0 , but coach @entity94 stressed the gravity of the incident and said he planned to take up the matter with @entity98 organisers @entity50 and @entity99			1
mr @entity94 said : ' the national flag difference is a big @entity102 team was not going to participate unless the problem was solved properly			1
' unfortunately it took some time later for the broadcast to be done again properly and we made the decision to go on with the match			0
' asked whether he believed the wrong flag had deliberately been used , mr @entity94 said : ' that was the question i was going to ask @entity50 and @entity99			2
' @entity50 said : ‘ the @entity23 flag was shown on a big screen video package instead of the @entity4 flag			1
' clearly this is a mistake			0
we will apologise to the team and the @entity118 and steps will be taken to ensure this does not happen again			0
’ @entity9 are @entity15 are neighbours but have a far from harmonious relationship			1
the countries were formally established as separate entities in 1948 , and the @entity125 began in 1950			0
the animosity continues today and the two countries share the world 's most heavily fortified border			2
@entity130 celebrate first win after women 's footballers beat @entity134 victory cheer : winning goal scorer @entity136 of @entity137 celebrates victory on the final whistle as @entity140 of @entity141 looks dejected there was a much better atmosphere down in @entity144 , where a crowd of 24,545 saw @entity130 ’s women footballers chalk up the country ’s first victory of the @entity98 yesterday with a 1 - 0 win over @entity141			1
the first @entity40 action on @entity152 soil since 1948 began at 4pm with a blast of the referee ’s whistle at the 74,500 - capacity @entity156 in @entity158			1
the winning goal that took @entity130 one step along their way to @entity162 came in the 63rd minute from a free kick from @entity164 ’s @entity136 , 27			1
this was the first time a women ’s team has represented @entity137 at any @entity40 , even though the fairer sex has been playing the beautiful game since 1895			1
one day a future @entity170 may insist on calling it simply football , but right now the women are still the underdogs			2
that was effectively underlined yesterday when @entity176 , whose father @entity177 is the face of football on the @entity49 , referred on @entity180 to the triumphant side as ‘ birds trying to play football ’			2
he told his followers the opening event was making him ‘ lose the will to live ’			0
blokishly , he added that he was heading off down the pub. but here in @entity158 it was a dramatically different atmosphere , in which patriotism overwhelmed sexism			0
hoofin it for @entity130 : @entity137 's @entity136 scores the opening goal of the game during the @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity199 match against @entity141 at the @entity156 what a goal : @entity136 celebrates with her team mates @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity137 's @entity205 after scoring @entity130 's men football team face @entity208 tonight at 7.45pm in a first - round @entity211 match			1
the game will take place at @entity215 's home ground , @entity216			2
players including @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 will be hoping to make up for being beaten 2 - 0 by pre-tournament favourites @entity222 in their final warm - up match last friday			1
the only other events today are the other first - round men 's football matches , including @entity227 vs @entity222 at @entity158 's @entity156			1
@entity228 , 47 , who coaches youth teams at her home in @entity231 , @entity232 , and is a big fan of the women ’s game , said : ‘ they ’re technically better than the men , probably because the pace is a bit slower			1
‘ they ’re not such big drama queens either			2
if they get caught they just get back up and get back on with it			0
’ the crowd was n’t the biggest women ’s football has ever seen but it carried a distinct buzz			1
there were chants of ‘ @entity250 , @entity250 ! ’ no one ate all the pies			0
no one questioned whether the referee knew both her parents			0
there were only two yellow cards and no red ones			0
as far as i could detect , no one felt the need to spit , swear , or aggressively challenge decisions that went against them			0
so there are clearly a few things the blokes can learn from these young women			2
newcomers to the sport might be surprised to see that they are not strapping great lasses			0
some are barely over 5ft tall			0
nor are they big money - earners			2
top players command only around £ 30,000 a year – it would take @entity275 and former @entity277 captain @entity276 less than 36 hours to top that			0
but now there ’s some glory in which to bask			2
team coach @entity281 said : ‘ we wanted them just to go out there and have fun			0
but they made history today , and that will never change now			0
’ clearly , she needs some coaching in footy - speak at this level			0
what she meant , of course , is that the girls done well			0
there were plenty of seats to choose from as @entity137 and @entity141 emerged into the @entity156 to get the @entity298 underway fans get ready for the start of the @entity40 at the @entity156 in @entity158 , but there were plenty of empty seats at the @entity137 versus @entity141 women 's football match			1

@entity7 - based video producer ' at fault ' for yesterday 's blunder
official ' has since offered to resign ' after technical gaffe
@entity9 walked off the pitch for around an hour
sides were then *announced* again and correct flag shown on big screen
coach said he would take up the matter with the @entity98 organisers
@entity130 ’s women footballers chalk up the nation ’s first win of the @entity98 by beating @entity141 1 - 0
