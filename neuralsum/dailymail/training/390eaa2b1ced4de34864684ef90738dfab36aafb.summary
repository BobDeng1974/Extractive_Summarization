by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 16 november 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 16 november 2013 young brother and sister lion cubs squabble in a play - fight as their father relaxes nearby			1
when one of them picks up a stick , the other gets jealous and takes the fight to its sibling			0
but @entity12 is in a tolerant mood and joins in the action , wrestling with them on the floor as his six - month - old cubs climb all over him			1
get off me ! the cubs playfight like squabbling children , says award - winning photographer @entity21 paws and claws : wrestling teaches the young cubs paw - eye co-ordination award - winning wildlife photographer @entity21 watched the cubs at play in the late afternoon sun in the @entity31 area of @entity32 in @entity33 in southern @entity34			1
after a long daytime nap , the cubs became restless , which meant mr @entity21 was treated to a fantastic insight into their behaviour			1
mr @entity21 , from @entity40 , said : ' the brother and sister are wrestling and squabbling much like children do whilst the parents continued to nap ahead of nightfall			0
' in addition there are some images with the cubs having a wrestle with @entity12			2
' when cubs are small , males generally remain at a distance from the pride but older cubs are fascinated by their fathers , often approaching them and trying to play			1
get your paw out of my eye ! one of the cubs clambers over his father 's face get off ! while @entity12 is helping his cubs to learn to fight and hunt , one day he and his peers will replaced as the coalition leading the large pride when i 'm grown up ... : @entity12 's paw is n't much smaller than his young cub 's head come on , @entity12 : the cubs ' father must have been in a tolerant mood , observed mr @entity21 ' this often results in either the lion telling the cub to go away or , if the cub is lucky and the lion is in a good mood , the male will play while teaching the cub fighting skills in the process			1
' here , the cubs were just with @entity12 , who was in a very tolerant mood			2
' the family belong to an unusual 35 - strong pride of lions which is run by a coalition of five males			0
according to mr @entity21 , once a coalition has taken over a pride , they usually have two years before losing to a younger coalition			0
however , the larger the coalition , the better , because a coalition of four to six lions may last up to four years			0
take that ! brother and sister playfight in the cool of the late afternoon in @entity33 's @entity32 he said : ' @entity103 are intensely social cats while others are quite solitary which is largely an adaption of cooperative hunting strategies			1
' for that reason , lions are the cats you 're most likely to see socialising and playing with each other in large groups			0
' like many animals , lion cubs learn from playing as they learn how to coordinate , control , and develop their muscles such as eye and paw coordination			2
@entity103 down : after a long daytime nap the cubs had become restless in training : the future top cats were learning skills that would stand them in good stead for hunting ' essentially it is preparing to learn on how to hunt			2
' there were plenty of sticks around but once one had been selected , they both wanted it			0
' it 's likely the stick resembles prey or a toy and the wrestling over the stick is a cat way of demonstrating social ranking			0
