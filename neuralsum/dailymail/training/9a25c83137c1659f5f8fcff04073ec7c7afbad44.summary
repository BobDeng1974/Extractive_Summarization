the interaction was filmed by the @entity12 for his online series , @entity29 , where he gets coffee with a celebrity shock : an incredulous deadmau5 gives @entity47 a funny look after he orders the caffeine - packed drink @entity46 had first reached out to @entity47 to be part of the show by tweeting at him in april , and on monday , with @entity47 settled back to work following his visit to rehab , he picked him up from @entity55			1
during the 30 - minute clip , the two men cover a range of topics - peppered with plenty of expletives			1
they chat about football , @entity2 's pot holes , the city 's new $ 4.5 million bmx track - which @entity47 brands a ' scam ' - and how after work , he goes home , sees his kids and plays risk			2
