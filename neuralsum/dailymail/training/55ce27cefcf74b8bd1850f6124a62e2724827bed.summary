comedian @entity0 loved a good pun heard the one about @entity3 ’s introducing an @entity5 chocolate bar to its range ? could be a @entity8 @entity7			1
that ’s not my joke			1
it belongs to comedian @entity12 and it has just won the annual award for @entity14 at the @entity15 , as voted for in a public poll			1
but it ’s also , like most of the @entity19 gags in the poll , a pun — an old - fashioned , straightforward play on words			1
indeed , it ’s so old - fashioned that i can remember my sister reading out a similar joke from @entity27 magazine in the @entity29 : ‘ why did @entity30 have chocolate on his face ? ’ — ‘ he was careless with his @entity7 ’			1
is @entity12 ’s line really the funniest joke of the year ? there ’s probably two dozen equally good puns in the average edition of @entity39 ’s @entity40			1
but puns always dominate the @entity43 list , because they require no context			1
they ’re always quotable ( and @entity46 ) in a way that other jokes , requiring a long set up or an element of visual humour , may not be			1
last year ’s winner was ‘ i ’ll tell you who gives kids a bad name : @entity56 and @entity57			1
’ it was n’t particularly ground - breaking , it was perhaps a little out of date , but it had immediate , widespread appeal			1
the runner - up was @entity66 ’s ‘ crime in multi-storey car - parks — that ’s wrong on so many different levels ’ , which , for me , is a better joke			1
you only have to look at @entity70 , or read the headlines in the tabloids , or listen to gags being told in pubs and playgrounds up and down the country , to realise that we @entity76 love puns			1
great writers : @entity80 loved puns while @entity82 could never resist them they have been embedded in @entity85 life and language for as long as we have spoken @entity88			1
in fact , before we spoke @entity88			2
in the 6th century @entity94 , pope @entity91 ’s reaction to seeing fair - haired @entity88 boys for the first time was ‘ @entity95 , sed @entity96 ’ — ‘ they are not @entity98 , but @entity99 ’ — proving that even @entity100 love a good pun			1
and any student of @entity88 literature quickly realises that even our greatest writers have had a weakness for double - meanings			2
@entity82 could never resist them			2
it ’s always satisfying to hear the audience groan in a @entity112 when @entity113 , magically given the head of a donkey , responds by saying ‘ this is to make an ass of me ’			2
you ’d think , with such a literary heritage , that puns would be a highly regarded art , but quite the opposite is true			2
puns are more often than not seen as an embarrassment			2
i remember a lecturer at @entity128 talking about @entity82 ’s ‘ fatal weakness for puns ’ , as if it were a major flaw in the @entity82 ’s credentials			2
indeed , in the world of comedy , puns are seen as the lowest form of wit			2
oddly @entity138 allowed some truly egregious puns into @entity140 ‘ a pun , ’ said @entity138 , of @entity141 and @entity140 fame , ‘ is a substitute for a joke			1
’ @entity138 would get famously angry at the pun - laden scripts of the @entity149 @entity148 radio hit @entity146			1
oddly , though , he allowed some truly egregious puns into @entity140			2
one hotel guest , discovering that the salt cellar is full of sugar complains that he has just sprinkled it ‘ all over the plaice ’			2
‘ all over the place ? ’ explodes @entity138 as @entity156			2
‘ what were you doing with it ? ’ even those who hate puns sometimes just ca n’t resist ’ em. radio comedy in the @entity164 and @entity165 revolved around puns , because radio comedy has to be about words rather than physical comedy			0
the biggest post-war wireless hit , take it from here — which launched its writers , @entity173 and @entity174 , towards decades of tv stardom — contained some famous ones , including the line ‘ infamy ! infamy ! they ’ve all got it in for me ! ’ which was later pinched for @entity178 , and delivered by @entity179			0
it was an age of much greater censorship , and the @entity148 were particularly stringent			0
in 1948 , the @entity148 ’s @entity184 , known as @entity185 , placed an ‘ absolute ban ’ on ‘ suggestive references to : honeymoon couples , chambermaids , fig leaves , prostitution , ladies ’ underwear and lodgers ’			0
puns were used to smuggle rudeness into scripts , both in broadcasting and on stage			0
everybody from @entity201 to @entity202 used puns to get round the censors			0
many of @entity201 ’s are still too rude for polite company and would be banned before the 9pm watershed			0
@entity208 , meanwhile , wrote a character called @entity210 into the @entity211			0
classics : old favourites @entity214 ( left ) and @entity208 ( right ) often used puns supposedly , he and @entity216 waited for the @entity148 to cut the line , but the bosses did n’t get the joke , and it stayed in			0
( the rhyming slang @entity221 was a reliable staple of @entity85 comedy			0
) then there were the @entity226 sketches of the mid-sixties			0
these characters were two highly camp and clearly gay unemployed actors who were forever trying out different jobs			0
the writers , @entity233 and @entity234 , gave them puns of exquisite cleverness that constantly tested the boundaries			0
as lawyers , they claimed ‘ we ’ve got a criminal practice that takes up most of our time ’ — a line delivered in the very year , 1967 — that homosexuality was decriminalised , and a rare example of a pun being used to make a satirical point			1
later generations , not subject to the same restrictions of subject - matter , did n’t understand the subversive role of the pun , and came to regard puns as just old - fashioned and feeble			1
the punning songs of the @entity252 were mercilessly satirised by alternative sketch show not the @entity254 , and critics regularly used ‘ pun - laden ’ as a term of abuse			1
puns were seen as childish			0
indeed , they are usually the basis of the first jokes children learn			0
today , the @entity148 ’s guidelines for sitcom writers expressly warn against puns			0
which makes it all the more heartening for lovers of the @entity88 language , with all its glorious potential for verbal mischief , that in 2013 puns are alive and well and thriving in the stand - up routines of comics like @entity12 and @entity66			1
but if you think puns are cheap or easy laughs , you ’d be wrong			0
think of the story of the headline writer on a @entity281 newspaper confronted by the news that @entity283 had comprehensively beaten a poor @entity285 side			0
this was an unexpected result , and @entity283 were delighted			0
the editor thought about it for a bit , and then wrote the headline @entity292 , @entity293			0
that ’s not an easy laugh			0

@entity12 won annual award at @entity15 for @entity14
like most of the top ten gags in the poll , it was a pun
