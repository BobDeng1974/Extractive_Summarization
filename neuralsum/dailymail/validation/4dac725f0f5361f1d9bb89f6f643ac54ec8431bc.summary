the sim card that helped revolutionise the mobile industry in the early days of bulky car phones is now approaching its 25th birthday			0
but while the handsets they are used in have developed and evolved significantly during that time , @entity4 still look the same - albeit smaller - and are still lodged inside devices			1
a @entity8 computer science experts believes the small microchips ' days are numbered and we should be signing into our phones in the same way we log into online accounts			1
dr @entity14 from the @entity8 said the @entity4 ( stock image ) could have been replaced long ago			1
he believes alternatives include typing in a user identifier and password directly into a phone ' the fact is , the @entity4 could have been replaced long ago with a simpler alternative : typing in a user identifier and password directly into the phone is an option - just as we do to access @entity27 , ' said dr @entity14 from the @entity8			1
or qr codes - the square , 3d barcodes - are a more convenient alternative for smartphones with cameras , where an app can read the details encoded in the @entity36 straight from the camera			1
dr @entity14 continued : ' sim cards were a useful feature when they came onto the market in 1991			1
' at the time mobile phones were bulky devices , usually mounted in cars [ and ] a @entity4 would help customers quickly and easily transfer their phone number and contacts from one phone to the next , without the need to type in long identifiers and access codes each time			1
alternatively , qr codes ( example pictured ) are a convenient way to store and access data using a smartphone camera ' but the days of huge or rented car phones are gone , and today smartphones are lightweight , personal devices that we entrust with passwords to many sites and services - access to @entity27 , email , social networks , app stores , and online shopping			1
' he believes replacing sims with passwords or extra software would make it easier to have multiple several pay - as - you - go contracts from different providers on a single phone			2
they could subsequently switch to the cheapest rate depending on where they were , and apps that functioned as brokers could even negotiate which network to select based on best price automatically			2
customers would also not be hindered by the complicated switching process currently used when moving phone numbers across networks			2
in terms of security , dr @entity14 explained that sim cards are also vulnerable to attack			1
@entity93 , the @entity95 sim card manufacturer , was reportedly the victim of an @entity98 and @entity99 attack for example			0
although the firm said that little information was stolen , ' the reality is that sim cards are now more of a drawback than a benefit , ' added dr @entity14			1
the @entity8 lecturer also believes the time is right to switch from sim cards because modern cryptographic techniques mean passwords no longer have to be very long			1
a @entity113 ( @entity113 ) network was established in the late 1980s to create a communication standard throughout @entity115			0
in 1991 , @entity117 smart - card maker @entity116 sold the first 300 sim cards to @entity120 operator @entity119			2
in 2014 5.2 billion @entity4 ( different sizes shown ) were sold making them lucrative for manufacturers @entity4 stands for subscriber identity module , which is the name of the integrated circuits found in the chips			2
phone numbers and other files can be added to these chips too			2
these modules store data that lets a phone identify who , and which device , it belongs to and connects it to the network			0
each card has a serial number as well as network information , and users can remove the card from one phone and install it in a new one without registering the device			0
the first sims were credit card - sized but has become smaller in recent years			2
in particular , many new handsets take micro-sims and @entity149 devices use nano - sims			0
the next level is embedded sims that can be attached directly to circuit boards			0
dr @entity14 said sim cards were a useful feature when mobile phones were mounted in cars ( pictured ) and customers wanted to transfer contacts from one phone to the next			1
but as phones have become more mobile , he believes the technology is outdated and should be replaced with a modern alternative password - authenticated key exchange ( @entity165 ) techniques exist that use passwords as a five - digit pin to create highly secure encrypted connections that even the supercomputers of eavesdropping intelligence agencies ca n't break			1
meanwhile , app stores use modern authentication technique and these could be used to easily transfer all the functionality of a sim into the phone using an app. ' all that â€™s needed is a new standard interface for mobile operating systems such as @entity181 or @entity182 that would allow software to take over the functions of the @entity4 , said dr @entity14			1
' technically , a mobile network login is no more challenging than similar applications such as payment wallets , online banking , digital rights managed content , and so on			0
' but he recognises that operators prefer the sim model because they can lock customers to their network , preventing easy access to competitors			0
plus , in 2014 5.2 billion sim cards were sold , making it a lucrative business for manufacturers			0
' manufacturers are understandably against anything that would eliminate their business			0
modern sims are tiny , difficult to access , and easy to lose once taken out of the phone			0
' in fact many users may not even know how to find or remove theirs , because it was inserted for them when they bought the phone			0
' this inconvenience allows providers to charge high roaming fees when customers use their phone abroad , when using a local operator would be cheaper			0

dr @entity14 said the @entity4 could have been replaced a long time ago
he believes one alternative could be typing in a user identifier and password directly into a phone - like we do with @entity27 networks
or details could be encoded in @entity36 *photographed* by a phone camera
the @entity8 lecturer also believes the time is right to switch because of recent advances in cryptographic techniques
