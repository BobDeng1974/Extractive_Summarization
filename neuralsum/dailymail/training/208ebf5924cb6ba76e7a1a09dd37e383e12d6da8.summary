by @entity0 @entity1 was left red - faced last night after voters rejected his boast that he is ‘ more intelligent ’ than @entity4			1
according to a @entity7 poll , the prime minister is seen as more than twice as intelligent as the @entity9 leader , who is lagging behind @entity11 ’s @entity10 in the brainbox ratings			2
even more embarrassing , @entity1 is regarded as ‘ thicker , wetter and more sexless ’ than @entity4 , the @entity13 ’ @entity13 and @entity10			1
@entity4 was described in the poll as cruel , bullying and phoney the ‘ political insults poll ’ was commissioned by this newspaper after a week in which @entity1 launched a provocative twin assault on the conservatives			1
he argued he is ‘ more intellectually self confident ’ than @entity4 and followed it up with a @entity9 tv broadcast that portrayed the pm as rich , uncaring and out of touch , and @entity13 as his feeble puppet			2
however , the @entity28 poll suggests @entity1 may have been better advised to heed the adage about people in glass houses and stones			0
asked to judge the four main leaders on ten less than flattering character traits , @entity1 comes top in three – ‘ thick ’ , ‘ wet ’ and ‘ sexless ’			2
@entity4 hardly has anything to shout about , with first place in the five categories of ‘ cruel ’ , ‘ remote ’ , ‘ phoney ’ , ‘ sanctimonious ’ and ‘ bully ’			2
deputy prime minister @entity13 is seen as more ‘ naïve ’ than the others , while @entity10 is the most ‘ cocky ’			2
asked who is the most ‘ intellectually self confident ’ , @entity4 wins by a country mile on 33 per cent , with @entity10 on 16 , @entity1 14 and @entity13 a meagre six			1
a total of 31 per cent of those polled did n’t know			0
labour leader @entity1 was described as wet , sexless and thick a total of 17 per cent said @entity1 is ‘ thick ’ with @entity4 seen as ‘ least thick ’ of the four on nine per cent			1
asked which leader is most ‘ wet ’ , @entity1 comes top again , on 27 per cent , with @entity13 on 25 , @entity4 13 and @entity10 seven			1
a total of 19 per cent say the @entity9 leader is ‘ sexless ’ with @entity10 on 12 , @entity4 11 and @entity13 nine , making the @entity13 leader the sexiest of the four			1
@entity4 ’s ‘ cruel ’ image will do little to help him shed the ‘ @entity51 ’ tag that has dogged the @entity50			0
and the perception of him as a ‘ remote bully ’ has echoes of his membership of @entity57 ’s notorious @entity56 in his student days			0
however , @entity61 mp friends of the prime minister said he could draw some comfort from the findings			0
one said : ‘ given the choice of being seen as a hard b * * * * * * or a wet rag , most leaders would choose the former			0
@entity69 may not have been loved by millions , but millions voted for her because they respected her			0
’ @entity13 leader @entity13 was described by those who completed the questionnaire as naive if the key to winning the next election is to convince the electorate you are a ‘ nice guy ’ , @entity1 may have the last laugh			1
a tiny five per cent regard him as a ‘ bully ’ and six per cent as ‘ cruel ’ , compared to 25 and 18 for @entity4 respectively			0
the two highest individual scores in the survey go to @entity13 and @entity10			0
one in three say the @entity11 leader is ‘ cocky ’ , with 28 per cent stating @entity13 is ‘ naïve ’			1
but @entity4 ’s big lead in brainpower has failed to overhaul @entity9 , which remains at the top of the poll to win the next election on 33 per cent , with the @entity50 five points behind on 28 , @entity11 on 20 and the @entity13 10			1
@entity85 interviewed 1,005 people online on friday and saturday			0
potential voters described the @entity11 leader @entity10 as ' cocky ' @entity1 opened up an aggressive new front in his class war against the government last week , using a controversial party political broadcast to portray the prime minister and his @entity94 as privileged , out - of - touch toffs			1
@entity1 , who is considered to be a member of @entity97 as the son of celebrated @entity100 academic @entity99 , lives in a £ 2.4 million @entity102 home and has an estimated joint annual income of £ 350,000 with his barrister wife @entity104			0
and what about the rest of his team ? here we profile some of @entity9 ’s top figures to reveal their wealth , private school backgrounds and family connections to rival anyone in the @entity61 .			0
