the head of the world 's economic watchdog delivered a stunning endorsement of the coalition 's record last night - saying @entity6 was setting an example to the rest of the world			1
@entity10 , director of the @entity11 , said in much of the world growth was ' too low , too fragile '			1
but completing an extraordinary volte face on the government 's austerity measures - which as recently as 2013 were being attacked by the @entity16 as ' playing with fire ' - she called on other countries to look to the @entity6 's example			1
' the @entity6 is leading in a very eloquent and convincing way in the @entity34 , ' she said			2
' a few countries , only a few , are driving growth : one is the @entity37 , where growth is solid , anchored and where we foresee a 2015 that will be also a good year			0
and the @entity6 where clearly growth is improving , the deficit has been reduced , and where the unemployment is going down			2
miss @entity10 said mr @entity23 's coalition government was setting an example to the rest of the world ' certainly from a global perspective this is exactly the sort of result that we would like to see : more growth , less unemployment , a growth that is more inclusive , that is better shared , and a growth that is also sustainable and more balanced			1
' miss @entity10 's endorsement will be greeted with delight by senior conservatives and @entity58 , who were angered by previous @entity11 criticism of their policies			1
in 2013 , the organisation warned that persevering with strict austerity policies risked denting @entity6 's economic prospects			1
@entity65 , chief economist at the @entity11 , said @entity66 was ' playing with fire ' by pressing ahead with austerity , insisting : ' in the face of weak demand it is really time to reconsider an adjustment to the fiscal consolidation plans			2
' shadow chancellor @entity74 , also in @entity29 , said @entity6 and the @entity37 were doing ' better than the @entity75 ' but had ' stagnant living standards '			0
people would be worse off in real terms by may 's general election than they were in 2010 , he said			0
mr @entity74 also insisted that exiting the @entity34 under a re-elected @entity81 government which has pledged to hold an in / out referendum was now the biggest risk to @entity6 's economy			1
former @entity37 treasury secretary @entity85 said : ' @entity6 's place is for the @entity6 to decide			1
but as an @entity37 friend of @entity6 i think it would be a disaster if @entity6 were to leave @entity91			0
one of the central themes of our report is the importance of collaboration between countries in making the global economy work for everyone			0
' otherwise you 're going to have taxes cut rapidly for the very wealthy , who are able to move , which is going to force them to be increased on working people			0
you 're going to see regulatory standards cut in an effort to attract businesses			0
' we need systems of cooperation , that enable the global economy to be managed , and that will be much less likely if @entity6 is on its own and is not part of the @entity34			2
' mr @entity23 also met with @entity37 president @entity115 at the @entity116 in @entity29 last night the two leaders chat as they walk the colonnade from the @entity116 to the @entity119 at the @entity120			0
