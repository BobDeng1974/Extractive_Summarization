the wonderful weather means open windows , eating outdoors and - unfortunately - lots of flies , wasps and mosquitoes			1
simply press the button on the handle and take a swing at the annoying flying insect of your choice to kill it			2
not suitable for children under eight			0
pros : this racket is sturdier and gives off a more powerful charge than some i 've seen			0
and of course , as soon as you get it out , everyone wants to have a go			0
@entity35 : it 's cruel			1
although the racket zaps all manner of bugs with a satisfying sizzle , it does n't always kill them , so you end up having to put flies out of their misery with your flip - flop			1
some get stuck in the wires			0
verdict : 1/5 cute but ineffective : lovebug @entity52 lovebug @entity52 , £ 9.95 , @entity53 designed to protect babies from mosquitoes , this cute , battery - operated , clip - on device emits a low - level tone that imitates the sound of a dragonfly 's wing beat - mosquitoes ' natural predators			1
@entity62 : there are no insecticides or chemicals involved			0
neat and well - made			1
it looks good , too			0
@entity35 : we took this to a lakeside restaurant , where my 12 - year - old son had been bitten badly by mosquitoes a couple of weeks ago			1
i clipped the @entity73 to the top of his sock ... and he was bitten again almost immediately			0
verdict : 0/5 the waspinator : not pretty but could keep wasps away @entity79 , £ 9.50 for a set of two , qvc.com this sinister - looking grey bag is designed to deter wasps by mimicking a real nest			1
the theory is that when foraging wasps see the @entity79 they will mistake it for another colony 's nest and stay well clear			1
@entity62 : a cheap and natural way to deter wasps			0
they did seem to keep their distance with the @entity79 hanging from a garden parasol			0
@entity35 : if there is an established nest in your garden this is unlikely to work , as the resident wasps will assess the threat of the ' new ' nest and realise it is not real			0
it 's not pretty but who cares if it keeps the wasps away ? verdict : 3/5 useless : plastic bag filled with coins and water plastic bag filled with water and copper coins , 10p if the thousands of online testimonies and the butchers in some of @entity117 ’s poshest farmers ' markets are to be believed , you can deter flies by hanging up clear , plastic bags filled with water and a few copper coins			1
no one seems to know how they repel flies , but most seem to agree that the refraction of light from the water and shiny coins in the bags upsets their vision and sends them packing			1
@entity62 : cheap and cheerful , this is a fly deterrent that anyone can make			1
@entity35 : it did n't work - at all			1
i hung two bags of water and copper coins next to the open @entity140 doors that lead from our garden into our kitchen			0
i was inundated with just as many annoying flies as usual , leaving me feeling distinctly short - changed			2
verdict : 0/5 small but powerful : the @entity147 candle @entity147 , £ 5.99 , from @entity149 stores this is a small tin containing seven tiny candles and a ceramic ring infused with pyrethrin - an insect repellent extracted from chrysanthemums			1
the candle is placed in the centre of the ceramic ring , and when lit its heat releases the pyrethrin into the air to repel mosquitoes , flies , midges and wasps			2
the manufacturer claims one candle will clear an 8m x 10m space of flying insects for up to 24 hours			0
this will also keep bugs away if you burn it at a picnic or barbecue			0
@entity62 : small but powerful , this almost odourless set - up is just the thing for camping , eating alfresco or keeping a hotel room mosquito - free			2
when i burned one during an evening meal outdoors , bugs did not bother us			0
@entity35 : as with any candle you have to be very careful where you burn it - and make sure you extinguish it afterwards			2
inhaling any sort of insecticide is never going to be a good idea , so make sure it 's not too close to you while it 's alight and you are in an area where there is plenty of fresh air flowing through			2
verdict : 4/5 useful but unattractive : @entity198 adjustable @entity198 , £ 3.79 , lakeland.co.uk this tea tree and citronella fragranced block contains permethrin , a powerful insecticide - so it 's not just a repellent , as @entity206 describe it , but also promises to kill bugs , too			1
the block is saturated with the fragrance and the insecticide , so when opened it should keep a small room free of flies , wasps and mosquitoes for up to 60 days			0
@entity62 : the compact shape and pleasant fragrance of this product make it an ideal table companion for eating outdoors			0
the smell of citronella has been scientifically proven to repel mosquitoes and flies - and it did seem to drive a random fly out of my office quite quickly after i placed it on my desk			1
@entity35 : the block is pictured in a tasteful , pale green on the @entity206 website , but when it arrived it turned out to be a horrible , cheap - looking bright yellow			2
insects have to come into contact with permethrin for it to kill them , so i ca n't see how this product - with its insect - repelling fragrance - could actually annihilate many bugs			2

the @entity13 is a battery - operated fly swatter
it 's cruel but fairly effective
