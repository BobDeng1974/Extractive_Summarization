by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 12:56 est , 7 may 2013 it took a lot of planning and manpower to build @entity5 and @entity6			1
and 22 years of labour went into constructing the @entity8			0
but now , you too can achieve the same , in a fraction of the time ... out of @entity11			2
@entity12 , one of the very few professional @entity11 builders in @entity14 , has designed a series of cityscapes remade in miniature			1
these include @entity19 in @entity20 ( 20,000 bricks ) ; the @entity8 ( 28,000 ) ; and the @entity22 ( 13,000 )			1
it contains 180,000 bricks and is 5ft tall and long mr @entity12 's book shows you how to build mini marvels , such as this 20,000 - @entity11 brick version of @entity19 in @entity20 the original @entity8 , in @entity32 , @entity33 , took 22 years to build			1
this one should take just several hundred hours to help fellow enthusiasts , he has written a manual , @entity37 : @entity38 - which reveals how to make mini versions of @entity40 , the @entity41 , the @entity42 and also street scenes of @entity44 , to name but a few			1
one of his masterpieces - @entity6 and @entity25 - was unveiled yesterday and will be on display at @entity49 in @entity50 , central @entity51 , for a month			2
the 180,000 - brick model is 5ft long and 5ft high - and includes six @entity54 platforms , complete with working trains			1
the 36 - year - old @entity56 ( that 's ' adult fan of @entity11 ' ) has even left part of the building exposed to show details such as commuters running down escalators and a guest in a hotel bath			2
@entity12 is one of only three or four adults who have a full - time job making structures from @entity11			1
above , @entity5 the building , which took 500 hours to make , was a two - year labour of love for mr @entity12 , who gave up his job as an it consultant half a year ago			1
he is now one of only three or four adults who have a full - time job making structures from the plastic bricks			0
just last week , mr @entity12 was paid £ 1,500 for making an 18in - long corporate logo out of @entity11 - and charges up to £ 25,000 for replicas of monumental buildings , such as the @entity79 of @entity80			1
not bad for 300 hours ' work			0
a street scene in @entity44			0
mr @entity12 sometimes pops down to @entity83 to buy his plastic coloured bricks and if you 're wondering where he buys the materials to create his intricate artworks , the answer is simple			0
' i buy my @entity11 from the same outlets as you do			0
occasionally i pop down to @entity83 , ' he told the @entity93			0
another source he uses is bricklink.com - an online marketplace where people trade around 200million different types of @entity11 parts			2
as well as long - term projects geared towards adults , mr @entity12 's book also caters for children			2
his guide shows how a 10 - year - old can make a red @entity51 telephone box , @entity107 junk or @entity109 taxi in about an hour			2
and the key to thinking the @entity11 way ? imagination			0
' the only restriction is your imagination			0
you really can build anything you like , ' he said			0
