delivery driver @entity0 , 22 , was on the @entity19 near @entity20 in the early hours of saturday morning , when his van left the road and ploughed into a tree on his passenger side , before veering to the right and crashing into another tree			1
the second tree stopped the vehicle rolling further down an embankment , but the double impact sliced the roof off mr @entity0 's @entity31 and reduced the van into a twisted heap of metal			1
the twisted remains of @entity0 's van after it left the @entity19 near @entity20 and crashed twice into trees mr @entity0 , who lives in @entity38 , @entity39 , said he did not remember what caused the crash , but recalled finding himself wedged within the battered van			1
miraculously , he did not break a single bone in the impact and came away with superficial wounds			2
he said : ' apparently , the police , ambulance and firefighters did n’t expect to find me alive			2
i ’ve seen pictures of other crashes and the cars do n’t look half as bad as mine			2
' i ca n’t believe i made it out without major injuries			2
' all i suffered was a cut to my forehead , a few grazes on my legs and a bruised foot , nothing really			2
' the worst injury i had was a cut on my hand from windscreen glass , but even that happened after the crash when i was trying to get out of the van			1
' mr @entity0 , who started working for his father 's @entity69 - based delivery service , @entity71 , had begun his shift at midnight			1
he said : ' the last thing i remember is making a delivery in @entity75 earlier in the night			0
at the time of the crash i was on the @entity19 , apparently driving from @entity78 to @entity20 , but i do n’t remember being there			2
' mr @entity0 came round after the impact to find a @entity82 truck driver , who had passed by the accident , calling 999			1
when ambulance and fire services arrived on the scene they removed him from the wrecked vehicle			0
the roof of the @entity31 was sliced off in the impact , but miraculously driver @entity0 escaped relatively unharmed he explained : ' they did n’t even have to cut the roof off as it was already gone			1
they just cut some of the steering wheel so i could be pulled out			0
' the lucky driver was taken off to @entity97 with a neck brace , as a precaution , but a ct scan and x-rays revealed that incredibly , @entity0 had not suffered any fractures			1
he has suffered some memory loss , but doctors have told him he may get his full memory back at some point			0
police believe the accident happened around 4am , the same time his @entity108 navigation system stopped working , but it is still unknown what caused it			0
lucky : @entity0 escaped from the crash with a few superficial cuts and bruises mr @entity0 added : ' the @entity108 system records speed and i was n’t driving over the speed limit			1
it was very wet and windy so it could have been that i skidded , and the police say i could have fallen asleep			0
“ but i was talking to my friend on my hands free kit at 3.50am , so i would have been quite alert and the doctor thought it was unlikely that i would have dropped off so quickly			0
' looking at pictures of the written - off van , which is undergoing tests to determine if there was a fault with it , mr @entity0 credited wearing his seat belt for his miraculous escape			1
he said : “ i ca n’t believe how lucky i was			0
i just keep thinking , if there had been anyone in the passenger seat , they would n’t have stood a chance			0
“ my girlfriend @entity141 usually comes with me on my friday night and saturday morning shift , but luckily this week she came on wednesday instead			0
it ’s just so lucky she was n’t with me			0
” mr @entity0 added : " when i look at pictures of the wreckage , i ca n't believe i was n't more badly injured or killed			1
if there had been anyone in the passenger seat , they would n't have stood a chance			0
