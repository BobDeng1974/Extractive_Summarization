@entity0 delivered for under - fire @entity1 as the @entity4 striker scored a brace in @entity7 's 2 - 0 win over @entity8 in their opening @entity10 qualifier			1
the former @entity12 outcast found the net after breaks in the 58th minute and in time added on as @entity7 , much maligned after their uninspiring 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity18 , got off to a perfect start against their main @entity21 rivals			2
here , @entity23 's @entity22 gives his verdict on the performance of the players			1
confidence : @entity0 was man of the match against @entity8 after scoring twice winner : @entity7 players crowed around @entity0 after the @entity4 signing scored against @entity8 cool finish : @entity0 takes his chance four minutes into time added on with aplomb @entity7 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity36 : made a good save with his feet in the first half and did well to stop another in the second just before @entity7 ’s goal			1
7 @entity42 : still something of an emergency right back but will be pleased with his night ’s work when under pressure			0
6 leg out : @entity7 goalkeeper @entity36 saves an excellent @entity48 chance with his out - stretched right leg @entity50 : consistent , solid and made a match - saving clearance in the second half to block a certain @entity48 goal on the line			1
7 @entity56 : a mixed bag			0
solid but at times too theatrical with his defending but unlucky not to score with a textbook header			0
6 strong : @entity7 's @entity56 gets a good connection on a header but sees it well - saved by the @entity48 keeper @entity63 : would have liked to see him get forward more but an improvement on the @entity18 game and did well defensively			1
6.5 @entity67 : not sure he ’s the one for that deep - lying role and occasionally ran into trouble with nobody to cover him			0
6 too deep : @entity67 was put in a holding role that he was n't entirely comfortable with @entity73 : would like to see him more on the ball but his energy can not be questioned			0
he did n’t stop running all night			0
6 @entity76 : an over-enthusiastic start but played with great responsibility and unlucky not to win a penalty on debut			2
6.5 mixed night : @entity76 got off to an over-zealous start but justified his inclusion on his starting debut @entity84 : not his best night and did n’t run at people like he does for @entity86 but a fantastic pass for @entity0 ’s first goal			1
6.5 @entity89 : showed good touches , reliable in possession and did well to drive forward and release @entity84 for the goal			2
6.5 @entity0 : seems like his move to @entity4 has instantly given him the confidence to be the main striker			0
8 danger man : @entity84 finds space as he threatens the @entity48 defence but did n't have a great game skipper : @entity7 captain @entity89 fires a header over the top substitutes @entity104 ( for @entity67 73 , 6 ) @entity105 ( for @entity56 77 ) @entity106 ( for @entity89 90 ) not used : @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 @entity112 - @entity1 : under more pressure than anyone else but brave to pick @entity76 and using the @entity86 system worked to great effect			1
8 @entity117 : 6.5 perfect timing : @entity0 arrives to meet @entity84 's cross to give @entity7 the 1 - 0 lead @entity8 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) @entity121 5.5 @entity122 6.5 defiant : @entity8 keeper @entity123 , of @entity124 , made a number of great saves going in hard : @entity48 defender @entity127 makes a sliding tackle on @entity76 @entity129 6 @entity130 5.5 @entity131 6 @entity132 6.5 ball security : @entity135 midfielder @entity134 protects the ball from @entity89 @entity134 7 @entity137 6 ( @entity138 64 5.5 ) @entity139 7 ( @entity140 74 5.5 ) @entity141 7 @entity142 7 keeping tight : @entity48 danger man @entity141 is marked closely by @entity7 's @entity63 ( left ) subs not used : @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153			1
manager : @entity155 5 @entity117 : 6.4 @entity157 - @entity156 ( @entity158 ) : should have booked @entity76 for his first challenge			2
got the penalty shout from @entity161 after @entity56 ’ challenge right but called it wrong when @entity129 wiped out @entity76			0

@entity0 the star man after goals on 58 minutes and in time added on
@entity76 impressed after an over-zealous opening to his starting debut
@entity7 's @entity36 and @entity48 keeper @entity123 made *important* saves
under - fire boss @entity1 *praised* by @entity23 's @entity22 for brave selection of @entity76 and using @entity86 system to great effect
@entity84 and @entity89 had moment but not at their best
@entity50 made match - saving clearance off line to deny @entity138
@entity104 made his 50th @entity7 appearance off the bench
