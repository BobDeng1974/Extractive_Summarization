by @entity1 reporter published : 09:19 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 06:05 est , 2 june 2013 hundreds of animal welfare supporters marched through @entity3 today in protest at @entity5 plans to cull thousands of badgers			1
@entity8 guitarist @entity7 and @entity10 presenter @entity9 led calls for the plan - hatched to stop the spread of @entity14 - to be abanoned			1
a group of protesters set fire to a pile of newspapers , causing smoke to drift over the grounds of the @entity22			1
police officers arrived after a few minutes to put the fire out			1
the cull is designed to run for six weeks in order to kill at least 70 per cent of badgers in each area			2
in total about 5,000 animals will die			1
trained marksmen will either shoot them with rifles or shotguns in fields or after they have been trapped in cages			0
dogs on leashes will be used to find injured badgers but will not be allowed to drive them from below ground			0
a government agency will carry out sample post mortem examinations to see if the badgers have been shot humanely			2
if the cull is deemed a success in reducing @entity14 infection rates , further culls will be rolled out in other areas			1
the protests were made as two pilot kills in bovine tb hotspot areas in @entity75 were due to start			1
if successful , the government plans to roll out culling more widely in a bid to stop the disease , which is spread between badgers and livestock and between cattle			1
but experts , including scientists behind the long - term trial , have raised concerns the policy will have ' unimpressive ' results in reducing @entity14 and suggested it does not make economic sense			2
mr may , a long - time supporter of the campaign to spare badgers from execution , said : ' the great bit of new information is it has now been demonstrated that the cull can not make economic sense			2
it will lose the taxpayer money rather than save it			0
' that was really the last shred of reason that you could give for this cull going ahead			2
' it is a very good time for mr @entity107 to reconsider and withdraw from this monstrous cull , in the public interest			2
' the protesters say there is no evidence a cull will help eradicate the spread of bovine tb to cattle and fear it will wipe out entire populations of badgers in affected areas the badgers will be killed either in fields or after they have been trapped in cages by trained marksmen mr may said the cull calls into question whether @entity126 really is a nation of animal lovers the pilot culls aim to ensure free - running badgers can be killed humanely , with marksmen observed by independent experts to check they are killing the protected animal swiftly , and post-mortem examinations carried out to assess speed of death			1
' @entity14 is spreading at an alarming rate and causing real devastation to our beef and dairy industry			0
( the cull ) is an important step towards taking the action we need to tackle the spread of this disease in wildlife			1
' these pilot culls are just one part of our approach to control and eradicate this dreadful disease			2
we are using everything at our disposal to get to grips with @entity14 including new tougher controls on moving cattle , increased herd testing and working to get effective vaccines ready as soon as possible			0
' the pilots will also assess whether sufficient badgers can be killed in an area to have an effect in reducing @entity14 in cattle , following a long - term study which found culling 70 per cent of badgers in an area could reduce the disease in herds by 16 %			0
the government said the cull is necessary as part of efforts to stop increasing outbreaks of @entity14 in dairy and beef herds , which saw 28,000 cattle slaughtered in @entity176 last year			1
without action , infection and costs would continue to soar , officials said			0
@entity181 , which opposes the government - sanctioned plan , have tabled an @entity185 debate for wednesday			0
mr may said : ' it would be very rude of the government to start a cull when there is a major debate coming up			1
' our point is to save wild animals from abuse and there is no doubt this cull is going to cause intense pain on a massive scale to badgers			1
you can not call it humane , which is apparently what these pilot culls are about			0
' it has become increasingly apparent to me that , although we call ourselves a nation of animal lovers , we treat them appallingly			0
' a poll released yesterday revealed that the public is divided on the issue of culling , with around a third ( 34 % ) opposing the policy , and almost as many ( 29 % ) backing it			0
the remainder of those questioned did not know or had no strong views on a cull			0
a sign has been put up on the @entity223 near @entity224 ahead of the cull a poll said nearly a third of people were against the cull the @entity230 , which is supporting the cull , urged protesters not to hinder the pilot schemes , so information could be gathered by independent experts to assess if shooting free - running badgers could be done humanely			0
@entity237 , the government 's chief veterinary officer , told @entity239 how badgers would be killed ' quickly , without causing suffering ' .			0
