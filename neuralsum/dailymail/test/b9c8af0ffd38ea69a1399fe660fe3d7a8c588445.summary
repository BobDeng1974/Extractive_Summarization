if a picture is worth a thousand words , then @entity0 figures a picture can also span a thousand years			1
@entity0 , a @entity4 writer and self - described experimental philosopher and conceptual artist , has designed a ' millennium camera ' that he intends to mount in a churchless steeple on a college campus			1
he hopes the resulting photograph will chronicle climate change by taking a 1,000 - year exposure of a western @entity14 mountain range			1
@entity0 , an experimental philosopher , hopes to capture 1,000 years of changes at a mountain range in @entity14 with his ' millennium camera ' the camera , which is made of cooper and allows light to enter through a tiny hole and change paint inside , will create one image that @entity0 says will display centuries of changes to the environment if it seems far - fetched , consider that some of @entity0 ' previous endeavors include selling tracts of real estate in the theoretical extra dimensions of space - time and opening a photosynthetic restaurant that serves gourmet sunlight to plants			1
he has also been involved in choreographing honeybees ; copyrighting his own mind to give his ' intellectual property ' a 70 - year post-life extension ; and , controversially , joining in a bid to genetically engineer @entity42			0
even at his quirkiest , @entity0 notes he always has a serious message to deliver			1
in the case of the millennium camera — a cylindrical device small and light enough to hold in one hand but hopefully durable enough to survive the centuries — it 's encouraging people to think beyond their own human lifespan to what geologists call deep time , the lengthy periods in which the world changes on a grand scale			2
' we need to find a way to think in deep time if we are to responsibly make use of the technologies we have , ' he says			0
' so the camera is intended , in a sense , as a mental prosthesis , as a way of creating some sort of a feedback loop in deep time , where setting up the camera now , looking out into the far future , allows for people who are alive in the far future to see the decisions we made through the effect that they had			2
' but will it work ? the camera will be place on the @entity81 , and the @entity82 at @entity83 plans on holding an exhibition to show the resulting photo in the 3015 @entity0 hopes that the long - term photograph will make people think about time frames longer than their lives , such as the centuries that it takes for nature such as the @entity94 mountain range ( pictured ) to transform even @entity0 ca n't say for sure			1
nor is he certain humans will be around in 3015			0
nor , assuming they are , that someone will know to retrieve the camera and open it			2
a thousand years is , after all , a long time			2
in 1015 , the @entity99 of @entity100 was still more than 50 years away , the first crusade was more than 80 years away , and @entity102 would not reach the @entity103 for another 477 years			0
the camera , @entity0 explains , is very simple , so simple that nothing mechanically should fail			1
' which of course is the wrong thing to say , because then it will , ' he quickly adds			0
it begins as the old science fair standby , the pinhole camera , which allows light to enter through a tiny aperture			1
but since pinhole cameras are n't designed to last a thousand years , @entity0 made his of copper because of its resistance to corrosion			1
the pinhole he pierced through a rugged 24 - karat gold plate			0
to capture the exposure , @entity0 adapted a renaissance art technique by using rose madder , a sturdy , organic - based oil paint , applied directly to the copper in the back of the camera			1
digital photography was impractical , and he ruled out using film because it would deteriorate too quickly and besides , there 's always the chance by 3015 that society will revert to another dark age , without photochemical processing skills			0
' all you have to do is open up the camera and you 'll see the image , ' @entity0 says			1
that image will be of the @entity137 , a modest but picturesque mountain chain that scientists believe has existed for 200 million years			1
what a denizen of the 31st century would see is not a before - and - after image , not what today we might call time - lapse photography , but rather one picture depicting a millennium of change			0
for example , if the now heavily forested area were to gradually turn to grasslands , the trees , @entity0 predicts , will linger on the photograph as ghostly reminders of a prior period , set against the bolder outline of the more recent landscape			2
' so what you 're getting in a sense is ... a movie of the full period , of the full thousand years , but all compressed into a single frame , ' he says			0
@entity81 at bucolic @entity83 , where @entity0 studied philosophy in the 1990s , will serve as the camera 's tripod of sorts			1
@entity0 says that his ambitious project to make people think about ' deep time ' may be a failure			2
above , he explains his project at @entity83 the philosopher and journalist hopes that citizens of the 31st century will look at his image taken from a camera on @entity81 at @entity83 once part of @entity180 , the @entity178 steeple was retained as a freestanding structure after the church was demolished in 1949			1
@entity0 hopes such resiliency bodes well for its long - term survival			1
the camera is currently on display steps away from the steeple at the school 's @entity82 , where it has generated a mix of interest and skepticism from visitors , according to the museum 's curator , @entity193			0
' it might seem silly , and people might say , ' what 's the point of a camera with an exposure you 'll never see in your lifetime , what 's the point of any of it ? '' @entity193 says			0
' but the fact that it is provocative in that way is what 's so powerful about it			0
' later this spring , @entity0 will ascend a harrowing set of wooden stairs inside the dusty steeple , position the camera and open its shutter , beginning what he believes will be history 's longest exposure			1
he has n't sought a patent for the device , which he estimates costs about $ 100 in raw materials to build , saying he wants others to copy it and place their own millennium cameras strategically around the world			0
' i 'm well overstating the case for these cameras , ' he concedes			0
' i realize ( it ) may seem like a supreme act of egotism			0
it 's probably also an extreme act of naivety on my part			0
but i think you just have to give it a try			0
' he says it may take 10,000 years for humanity perfect the process of 1,000 - year photos			2
the philosopher set up a similar 1,000 - year camera at the @entity248 's sculpture garden as part of an effort to capture how the next millennium change @entity252 , @entity248			1
the @entity83 museum and the @entity248 museum both plan to exhibit the photographs in 3015			2
he also gave 100 - year cameras to some resident of @entity259 , @entity260 , last year , he told @entity261 .			0

@entity0 , experimental philosopher , plans to photo @entity137
he hopes pinhole camera will capture the gradual environmental changes in the mountains near @entity83
camera , which is filled with paint , will create image showing 1,000 years
