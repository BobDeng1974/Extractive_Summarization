by @entity0 published : 19:12 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 02:48 est , 22 february 2013 backlash : @entity2 has been criticised by aid charities for his decision to divert millions of pounds towards military operations aid money should be spent on ‘ schools , not soldiers ’ , charities said last night – as @entity2 faced a backlash over moves to divert hundreds of millions of pounds to the @entity12			1
charities reacted with alarm after the prime minister revealed he wants to use part of the vast aid budget to help pay for military peacekeeping operations			1
but former defence minister sir @entity19 hailed a ‘ welcome first step ’ and said security was an ‘ essential precursor to the provision of aid ’			2
the move will help protect the @entity12 from further spending cuts and also help the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) spend a 30 per cent budget increase due in april			2
mr @entity2 ’s plan was warmly welcomed by @entity30 who have raised increasing concern about the policy of cutting back defence spending while pouring billions more into foreign aid			1
but aid charities warned diverting money was potentially a major backward step			2
@entity39 ’s head of policy , @entity38 , said the aid budget should be spent on ‘ hospitals and not helicopter gunships ’			1
he went on : ‘ the millions of people up and down the country who support the fantastic stance the government is taking , protecting the aid budget when every other @entity50 nation is not doing that – they expect this to be spent on schools and not soldiers			1
‘ so we can not see any penny diverted into the military			0
’ however sir @entity19 said : ‘ @entity58 ’s armed forces contribute enormously to the provision of security and capacity building , which are essential precursors to the provision of aid and it is entirely appropriate to make those changes			0
‘ i have not come across a single conservative who is in favour of increasing aid at a time when we are cutting the @entity12 so this is a very welcome first step			0
’ spending : the prime minister revealed yesterday how he wants to use part of the aid budget to offset cuts to the defence budget clash : the head of policy at @entity81 , left , criticised @entity2 's plan but the move was welcomed by former defence minister @entity19 , right and @entity85 mp @entity84 , a former @entity86 officer , said security and overseas aid were ‘ inextricably linked ’			1
@entity89 insisted the switch would not affect mr @entity2 ’s controversial target of spending 0.7 per cent of @entity58 ’s total income on aid			0
money will be spent on peacekeeping and conflict prevention work rather than weapons , so should still count towards the target			1
the new approach means aid cash could be used to pay for troop training in @entity102 , demobilisation in @entity104 and providing assistance to rebel fighters in @entity107			0
much of the money could be channelled through the ‘ conflict pool ’ - a joint initiative between @entity27 , the @entity110 and the @entity111			0
overall aid spending will rise in april as the percentage of @entity58 ’s income spent on foreign aid rises from 0.56 per cent to hit the 0.7 target			0
meeting the target will require an increase from £ 8.65billion to £ 11.3billion in the coming year – a rise of more than 30 per cent .			0

money should be spent on ' schools not soldiers ' says head of @entity39
funding for military peacekeeping operations will offset defence cuts
