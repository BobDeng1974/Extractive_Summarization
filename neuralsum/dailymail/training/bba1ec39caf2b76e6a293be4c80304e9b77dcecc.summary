it is a quiz traditionally associated with the finest minds in the country			2
but media watchdog @entity3 has ruled that @entity4 was right to brand one mastermind contestant ' astoundingly thick '			2
@entity6 recorded one of the show ’s lowest scores in the history of the programme , but took umbrage when comedian @entity13 mocked him on a comedy show			1
struggle : @entity6 ' appearance on one episode of @entity18 did not go to plan , leading to one of the lowest scores ever and mocking from comedian @entity13 on his show @entity6 was nicknamed ' @entity23 ' in his home town of @entity25 , @entity26 , after his appearance on the @entity28 show in 2006			1
he scored just one point on his chosen subject - the @entity31 actor @entity30			2
the 47 - year - old claimed he was treated unfairly in an episode of @entity13 ’ @entity34			1
running commentary : @entity13 used his show @entity37 to mock @entity6 , claiming that he was ' astoundingly thick ' as he spoke over his attempts to answer the questions the programme , which was shown on @entity4 in january , included a clip of mr @entity42 which was introduced by @entity13 who said : ‘ sometimes in life , you have to know your limitations ... if you ’re not , let ’s say , very bright , it ’s probably not a good idea to go on a quiz show that tests your mental agility			1
‘ and by not very bright i mean , astoundingly thick			2
’ @entity13 then gave a running commentary as mr @entity6 passed on the first questions			1
the probation worker complained to @entity3 that he was portrayed as being of ‘ low intelligence ’ and that he had not given his consent for it to be shown			2
he was also unhappy the show did not mention the clip was from the semi-final of the famous quiz show - which means he had won a previous round			0
mr @entity6 , who is a self - confessed quiz addict , had already won £ 250,000 on @entity62 ? in its defence , @entity4 said that it was obvious mr @entity6 was not literally ‘ astoundingly thick ’ as he was on mastermind in the first place			1
but it added : ' this was the worst specialist subject performance ever seen on @entity18			0
’ @entity3 agreed and refused to uphold any of mr @entity6 ’s complaints			1
it ruled : ‘ we recognise that these comments carried the potential to be offensive and insulting to mr @entity6			1
‘ however we took the view that it would have been clear to viewers from the beginning of the programme that mr @entity13 - himself best known as a comedian - intended to provide humourous and light hearted opinion and comment on examples of past television clips			0
’ quiz addict : @entity6 took umbrage at @entity83 because he failed to mention it was a semi-final , meaning he had previously won an episode of the show viewers were left stunned by @entity6 ’ performance on the first round of @entity18 – in which he passed eleven times and got three answers wrong , before securing just one point			1
he had more success in the general knowledge round and had a final score of eight			0
quizmaster @entity96 said : ‘ i think his mind just went blank			0
you get people who are immensely knowledgeable and then it wo n’t come			0
you feel a bit sorry for them			0
' but mr @entity6 is not the worst performer on @entity18			1
last year @entity104 , a software analyst , posted the worst total in the show ’s 37 - year history - a paltry five points			0
his first round score of four out of 14 on his specialist subject - @entity112 of @entity113 [ founder of modern @entity115 ] - was followed by just one out of 15 in the general knowledge round			0
the 28 - year - old from @entity118 scored two fewer than the previous worst total , passing 11 times and giving 13 wrong answers .			0

@entity6 was nicknamed ' @entity23 ' in his home town
