by @entity0 it is the roo that could change history : a tiny drawing depicting what looks like one of @entity7 ’s most famous marsupials nestled among some branches has been discovered in a 400 - year - old @entity10 manuscript			1
the sketch of what is thought to be a ‘ canguru ’ ( kangaroo in @entity10 ) was found in the document , dated between 1580 and 1620 , which was acquired by the @entity16 in @entity17 from a rare book dealer in @entity19			1
the @entity21 ship @entity22 , which landed in @entity7 in 1606 , was thought to been the first @entity24 ship to dock on the mainland			1
however the discovery of the long - lost manuscript has led historians to believe that images of kangaroos had been circulating for decades before then			0
a tiny drawing of a kangaroo curled in the letters of a 16th - century @entity10 manuscript could rewrite @entity7 history the 16th century drawing was proof that the artist had either been in @entity7 or heard reports about the country and its native animals from other western @entity24 travellers , according to @entity16 researcher @entity42			1
‘ a kangaroo or a wallaby in a manuscript dated this early is proof that the artist of this manuscript had either been in @entity7 , or even more interestingly , that travellers ' reports and drawings of the interesting animals found in this new world were already available in @entity19 , ’ ms @entity42 told the @entity55			1
‘ @entity19 was extremely secretive about her trade routes during this period , explaining why their presence there was n't widely known			0
’ the manuscript also features of male figures adorned in tribal dress , baring naked torsos and crowns of leaves in the text , which ms @entity42 said could depict @entity68			0
native : kangaroos are one of @entity7 's most distinctive animals and experts believe that the drawing could prove @entity24 landed in @entity7 earlier than first thought the pocket - sized manuscript contains text and music for a liturgical procession			1
it is inscribed with the name @entity83 , who is believed to be a nun from @entity85 in western @entity19			0
@entity21 explorer @entity86 has long been credited with being the first @entity24 to discover @entity7 when he docked the @entity22 at the mouth of the @entity89 on the @entity90 in @entity91 in 1606			1
some historians , including author @entity93 , have long debated that the coast of @entity7 was actually first mapped by a @entity10 maritime expedition nearly a century before the @entity21 landing			2
‘ it is not surprising at all that an image of a kangaroo would have turned up in @entity19 at some point in the latter part of the 16th century			0
it could be that someone in the @entity10 exhibition had this manuscript in their possession , ’ mr @entity93 told the paper			0
other historians theorised that the drawing could be the result of expeditions made by @entity10 explorer @entity112 to @entity114 – which has similar flora and fauna to northern @entity91 where the @entity22 landed – in 1526			2
@entity119 curator of maps @entity117 said the kangaroo - like image was not proof enough to rewrite history as it could actually depict a number of other animals from south - east @entity126			0
‘ people will continue to look , but for now , unfortunately the appearance of a long - eared big - footed animal in a manuscript does n't really add much , ’ he told the paper			0
the @entity16 gallery will exhibit the manuscript - valued at $ us15 , 000 ( $ 16,600 ) - as part of a new exhibition @entity135 : chanting the @entity136 in the @entity137 and @entity138 .			2

drawing was found in a document which was bought by a @entity17 gallery
experts believe that the manuscript is dated between 1580 and 1620
they say that it could prove @entity24 landed in @entity7 before 1606
the book , which is worth $ 16,000 , will be on display in @entity17
