mothers are paying up to four times the recommended price for formula milk after two popular brands sold out in shops last month			1
@entity5 and @entity6 are marketed for babies who show signs of colic or constipation			2
some infants have become hungry and distressed since the shortage began , leading parents to take desperate measures			1
these three 900g tubs of @entity6 were going for £ 82 , but still had 12 hours and 30 minutes left bidding war : this tub of @entity31 formula milk was going for £ 63 , but bidders still had 35 minutes to increase their offers on @entity27 , one lot of three of the 900g tubs – officially priced at £ 10.99 each – had yesterday attracted 23 bids and was being sold for £ 100 plus £ 8 postage			1
babies raised on a particular formula are often extremely reluctant to switch to a new product or brand because they reject the taste and consistency			2
as a result , feeding – which can often already be extremely stressful for parents – may become even more difficult			2
one mother , @entity51 , from @entity52 , said that she had resorted to feeding her 11 - month - old daughter @entity53 with a replacement formula when she had fallen asleep			1
the 31 - year - old mother of three said : ‘ this is an absolute nightmare			1
parents had no warning that there was a problem			0
’ both @entity61 and @entity5 are owned by @entity63 firm @entity62 , who say that the shortage is due to problems in the supply of a crucial ingredient , maize starch , which is used to thicken the milk			1
mrs @entity51 said : ‘ my daughter has a slight lactose intolerance , which means i ca n’t put her on other types of formula			0
i tried alternative products and brands , but she just refuses to drink milk now			1
must have : babies become used to a certain milk , which has seen mothers go to extreme lengths to get the same formula ‘ i have had to take to feeding her while she is asleep , because that is the only way she will take it			0
‘ i feel very let down by the company			0
you ca n’t bring out these products only for them to suddenly disappear off the shelves , especially when you are dealing with the health of new born babies			1
’ the shortage has sparked an outcry on parenting websites			1
on the @entity99 website , one mother said that she had called more than 100 outlets in her search for the products			1
another wrote : ‘ does anyone know where i can get some dodgy @entity6 on the black market , i ’ll pay good money ! ! ! ’ it had been feared that the products would not return on to the shelves until mid-march , but @entity62 said that it has responded to parents ’ demands to bring forward the date to next week			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we very much regret that we are currently experiencing a shortage of these two milks which means parents are experiencing low and patchy availability			2
‘ we would like to apologise to parents who are using these milks as we are very aware of difficulties they are experiencing			0
unfortunately we have experienced a production delay due to the shortage of one key ingredient			1
‘ our careline operates 24/7 and as a priority we are helping parents to locate retailers who have these milks in stock			0
we recommend parents contact their health care professional if they need further advice			0
’ @entity62 spokesperson @entity135 said the company had been ' let down ' by its maize starch supplier			1
she said : ' we only use pre-approved suppliers , we do n't buy our ingredients from the open market because babies have to have the best quality standards			0
' unfortunately on this occasion we were let down by our supplier , however , we have pulled all the stops out and we have made more of that formula and it will be coming back on to shelves next week			0
' @entity149 , also known as corn starch or cornflour , is used as a thickening agent in liquid - based foods including soups , gravies and sauces			2
better times : a healthy - looking crop in an @entity160 corn maize field			2
last year the industry was hit by the worst drought in decades , leading to a shortage of the crop but @entity160 farmers were last year hit by the worst drought to affect the industry in decades , which has led to shortages of corn			2
earlier this month it was reported two dozen ethanol plants had been forced to halt production due to the shortage of the crop			1
going into 2012 , corn producers had high hopes and record harvests had been predicted , but the weather dried up before planting and the drought meant that even though more acres were planted compared to the previous year , 13 per cent less corn was harvested			0
just this week however , the @entity160 @entity180 said it expected a rebound in production and predicted record corn and soybean harvests for 2013 , in its official forecast for the year			0
parents across the country have been taking to social networking sites throughout the week , desperate to get hold of the popular brands of formula milk , since the shortages came to light			0
earlier this week , @entity194 was searching for the @entity17 formula when he wrote on @entity99 : ' we have been through @entity197 and called over 100 places @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206			1
' out of those places we found 4 with stock giving us enough milk for 5 weeks , they are now out of stock			0
' meanwhile , @entity212 wrote : ' i am in exactly the same position as everyone else			0
we have had @entity6 for the last 20 weeks which my little girl is really happy on			0
have been forced to try @entity217 but she 's not happy as her tummy is making funny noises again , she 's windy and does n't drink her whole bottle again ! ! ! ' now i ca n't get either of them anywhere in my local area , we have called every possible store / supermarket / independent chemist absolutely everywhere and no one has any comfort milk			2
' it 's a nightmare and i ca n't believe that two huge companies like @entity61 and @entity5 and @entity229 have allowed this to happen			0
' @entity231 also took to @entity99 yesterday to write : ' grrr i have been trying to get hold of @entity5 and @entity217 for the last week and we are now down to the last few bottles worth of formula ...			2
i cant believe they did n't announce anything ! ! ! ' parents this morning were continuing to panic after being unable to buy any of the formula milk			0
one @entity241 user called @entity242 wrote : ' i 've just checked online and apparently @entity244 milk is unavailable everywhere ! ! ! ! what am i supposed to do now ? ' meanwhile , @entity246 yesterday tweeted : ' urgent ! can anyone get hold of any @entity5 and @entity217 formula milk ? there 's a shortage and we know a baby who ca n't feed on anything else			1
