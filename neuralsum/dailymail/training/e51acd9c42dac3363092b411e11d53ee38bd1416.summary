@entity6 owner @entity5 , 77 , also allegedly told the @entity7 that ‘ jewish people chase money more than everybody else ’			1
the former owner of @entity12 – who is thought to be worth around £ 200million – is reported to have made the remarks as he defended his appointment of @entity15 as the new manager of the club			1

in another , he referred to @entity40 agent @entity39 , saying : ‘ nothing like a jew that sees money slipping through his fingers			2
’ and in a third , @entity15 said there were ‘ enough dogs in @entity36 to go round ’ after he signed @entity50 international @entity49			2
@entity5 ( right ) , who owns @entity6 , made the comment a day after sparking anger by hiring @entity15 ( left ) as the club 's new head coach defending the manager ’s appointment , mr @entity5 said he did not regard @entity15 ’s comments as offensive			1

’ he is also reported to have said : ‘ i think @entity40 people do chase money more than everybody else			1
i do n’t think that ’s offensive at all			0
’ today , mr @entity5 ( left next to @entity69 ) , the former owner of the @entity12 chain , claimed the scandal surrounding the texts and emails was a ' mountain out of a molehill ' mr @entity5 's decision to hand @entity15 a return to football has been widely criticised mr @entity5 claimed he did not think there was ‘ a lot wrong ’ with what @entity15 said , adding : ‘ i did ask @entity81 questions about the problems he ’s had on the racist thing			1

but a spokesman for mr @entity5 said : ‘ the quotes were taken out of context and twisted			1
’ mr @entity5 later apologised for his remarks			1
on the @entity110 if any @entity2 said he has never called a chinaman a chink he is lying			0
there is nothing bad about doing that			0
it is like calling the @entity116 , or the @entity118 paddies			0
