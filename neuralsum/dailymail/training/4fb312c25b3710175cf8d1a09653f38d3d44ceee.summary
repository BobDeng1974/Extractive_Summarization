by @entity0 the @entity1 has carried out ground breaking tests of its unmanned drone @entity5 alongside a manned @entity7 fighter jet			1
the tests were conducted on the carrier deck of the @entity10 in the eastern @entity11 on august 17			1
it was the first time that the two aircraft have operated from the same carrier			2
capt. @entity15 said : ‘ today we showed that the @entity5 could take off , land and fly in the carrier pattern with manned aircraft while maintaining normal flight deck operations			2
’ tests : a @entity23 drone , similar to this one , underwent tests alongside a manned @entity7 fighter jet aircraft carrier : the tests took place aboard the @entity29 in the @entity11 @entity30 : two f / a 18 jet fighters fly over the @entity1 cruiser @entity33 the @entity1 carried out ground breaking joint tests of its unmanned drone @entity5 along with a manned @entity7 ' this is key for the future carrier air wing , ’ he added			1
capt. @entity15 - the program manager for the @entity1 's unmanned carrier aviation office - along with @entity1 officials said that the test flights were a milestone in carrier - based naval aviation			1
on sunday morning , the drone flew in the landing pattern with the @entity7 at speeds of 120 mph , at a pattern altitude of 1,200 feet , according to manufacturer @entity50 after a short flight , the @entity5 came in for an arrested landing where a deck - based operator used a deck handling control to manually move it out of the way and taxied it out of the landing area			0
the @entity7 then touched down , close behind the drone			0
‘ this cooperative launch and recovery sequence will be repeated multiple times over the course of the planned test periods , ’ a @entity1 spokesman told the @entity58			2
‘ the @entity5 performed multiple arrested landings , catapults , flight deck taxiing and deck refuelling operations			0
’ combat drones are mostly used by the @entity69 and @entity70			0
landing : after a short flight , the @entity5 , similar to this one pictured , came in for an arrested landing where a deck - based operator used a deck handling control to manually move it the drones have a range of more than 2,400 miles and can be navigated by a human pilot even if they are located thousands of miles away – making it a military asset			1
it also means that missions carried out by drones can be conducted by a computer to chart its course			2
@entity1 fighter pilots fly missions for over 10 hours , but drones can fly for three times that long			1
the @entity5 is jet - powered and has a weapons bay with a payload capacity of 4,500 pounds			0
the drone has a 62 - foot wingspan and can fly higher than 40,000 feet			0
its nickname is ‘ @entity95 502			0
’ built by @entity50 , it looks like a @entity98 stealth bomber			0
but the @entity5 was designed as an experimental jet and stands at the cutting edge of technology showing how an automated system can work			0
the @entity1 has confirmed that it will carry out similar tests to the one done on sunday , in the near future			1
however while the exact cost of the test is unknown , there are estimates that the entire programme costs as much as $ 6billion .			1

the tests were carried out on the carrier deck of the @entity10
@entity1 officials said it signified the ' future for the carrier air wing '
the @entity1 said it will carry out similar tests of drones and jets in the future
the cost of the ground breaking programme is thought to be $ 6 billion
