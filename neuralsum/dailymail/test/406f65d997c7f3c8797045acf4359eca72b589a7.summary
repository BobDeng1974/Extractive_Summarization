sales of a @entity2 poncho carrying a personal monogram and costing more than £ 1,000 have helped boost profits the poncho originated as a rather humble garment worn by @entity9 tribes and later featured on the back of @entity11 in the spaghetti westerns			1
however , sales of a designer - label version carrying a personal monogram and costing more than £ 1,000 have been central to a sales boom at the very @entity18 prestige brand @entity2			1
the ponchos - together with heritage trench coats and scarves - have boosted @entity2 sales by 10 per cent over the winter			1
the wool - and - cashmere designs , which were first modelled on the catwalk by @entity26 , were a huge success among celebrities before @entity29			0
famous names including @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 were all seen sporting the ponchos , each monogrammed with their initials			1
and while the original inspiration for the designs may have been a rather modest attempt to keep out harsh weather , there was nothing modest about the @entity2 version			2
the basic asking price was £ 895 , while 70 per cent of sales went to customers who wanted their initials monogrammed on to the weave at the cost of an extra £ 200			1
the firm said its scarves and trench coats were a hit with customers and ‘ investment and innovation in ponchos drove exceptional growth ’			1
chief financial officer , @entity59 , described the impact of the ponchos as ‘ phenomenal ’ and suggested new variants are in the pipeline adding : ‘ there ’s lots more to come from the poncho story			0
’ the @entity18 brand has become a global success with sales up 10 per cent for the six months to the end of march compared to the year before , taking from up to £ 1.42 billion			1
sales were particularly strong in the @entity18 and @entity71 , not least because hordes of tourists from @entity74 flocked here to buy designer clothes and bags			0
currency fluctuations meant its trademark coats and scarves were up to 50 per cent cheaper in @entity71 cities than @entity83 , where the @entity74 traditionally shop for luxury merchandise			2
actresses @entity34 ( pictured left ) and @entity33 ( right ) both own the @entity2 poncho model @entity90 ( pictured left ) and socialite @entity93 ( right ) both have monogrammed versions such was the price gap that @entity74 entrepreneurs have been snapping up huge quantities of luxury label merchandise in @entity71 and then shipping it back to @entity74 to sell at a profit on the grey market			1
today bosses at @entity2 suggested they plan to follow other luxury brands , such as @entity103 and @entity104 , and harmonise prices around the globe to stop this happening			0
this could mean some price increases in @entity71 and falls in the @entity111			0
@entity2 ’s success has leaned heavily on a marketing campaign featuring celebrity @entity18 models			0
@entity26 starred in commercials for its trench coats and also appeared alongside @entity119 promoting the new @entity2 fragrance			2
around 70 per cent of the @entity2 bottles were monogrammed , a service the brand offers for free , suggesting personalisation of luxury products is a huge draw for consumers			1
twelve - year - old @entity128 featured in a popular pre-christmas campaign and @entity90 , the @entity131 model and actress , was the face of the brand ’s beauty range			0
@entity2 saw ‘ double digit ’ sales growth in the @entity138 and @entity71 and trading was particularly buoyant in @entity18 , @entity140 and @entity141 , from both locals and tourists			2
models led by @entity3 wear the poncho on the @entity2 catwalk ( left ) while @entity18 model @entity147 wore hers on a recent shopping trip , specially monogrammed with her initials @entity151 , of @entity152 , said : ‘ @entity2 remains in fashion following a trading update which underscores its ability to capitalise on its chosen markets			1
‘ the overall picture is extremely healthy – the strength of the digital contribution , particular product growth in the likes of the iconic trench coats and scarves and pleasing performances from the @entity165 and most of @entity71			0
‘ in addition , the company is well positioned for future , selective growth in terms of both stores and lines , such as beauty			0
‘ it seems that everything about @entity2 is premium – its brand , its products and perhaps of late its share price – a 25 per cent increase over the last year compares to a 7.5 per cent rise for the wider @entity180			2
’ chief executive @entity181 , who took over from @entity182 in may last year , said new products had helped to boost sales			0
‘ we are pleased to report a robust second half performance , despite an uncertain external environment , ’ he said			0
‘ we anticipate external challenges will continue in the current year , but remain confident in our long - term strategy to build the @entity2 brand and business globally			0
’ chief executive @entity181 ( pictured ) said new products have helped to boost @entity2 's sales			1
