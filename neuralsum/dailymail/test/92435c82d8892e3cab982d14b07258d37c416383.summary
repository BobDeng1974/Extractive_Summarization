a terminally - ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders			1
@entity7 , 61 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , wanted to marry his long - term partner @entity10 after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home			1
but , instead of having the magical day they had planned , the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly			2
guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over , and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two			1
@entity7 , 61 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , wanted to marry his long - term partner @entity10 , 54 , after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple 's special day ( pictured ) was full of blunders guests at the couple 's ( pictured ) wedding were forced to listen to the song ' @entity36 ' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on , rendering it invalid mr @entity7 , who died weeks after the ceremony in november last year , was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he 'd let her down			1
in fact , the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to @entity50 , which is based at @entity51 in the city centre , where the pair said their vows			1
mrs @entity55 , 54 , said : ' @entity7 was heartbroken by it all			2
he kept apologising to me and saying he 'd wished we 'd got married years earlier and done it properly			0
' he was devastated , as the way he saw it , this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness			0
' the couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once mr @entity7 discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal			1
however , the landlord of the @entity71 's @entity70 pub , in @entity8 , was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely			0
the pair then settled upon the @entity9 venue as it was not too far from their home			2
it took three people two hours to get mr @entity7 ready for his big day and , determined to make the day perfect for his bride - to - be , he battled through pain to make it to the venue			1
mrs @entity55 , 54 , said every guest at the ceremony - held in november last year in @entity9 - wrote a letter of complaint			2
she has three marriage certificates ( pictured ) as the first two were riddled with errors the couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony ( pictured ) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date			1
an amended version posted later was full spelling errors however , it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began			1
they said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down			1
then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows , which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar			0
mrs @entity55 , a mother of three , said : ' there was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after i asked i was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day			0
@entity7 and his wife @entity10 endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day			1
' it felt like they were merely using us a practice go , like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them			0
' after the bride and groom said their vows , guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music ' @entity36 ' while the registrar went out of the room			0
unbelievably , almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before mrs @entity55 was compelled to take action			1
she said : ' everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on			0
we could n't believe it			0
' it had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now			2
' after the ceremony , as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant @entity158 , the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate			1
they were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected , otherwise their marriage was invalid			2
mrs @entity55 told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead			0
however , when the second certificate arrived in the post , it was addressed to @entity55 in her maiden name ' @entity177 ' and included spelling errors on the document			1
a third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple			2
mr @entity7 ( above ) passed away in january this year , just weeks after his wedding to long - term partner @entity10			1
the couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year mrs @entity55 ( left ) said her new husband ( right ) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down			1
she has received £ 137 from the @entity9 register office following the calamity day mrs @entity55 said : ' it felt like they did n't recognise we were married and that really hurt @entity7 before he died			1
' it made if feel like the whole thing did n't happen , like it meant nothing at all			0
' the guests were all in tears for us			0
they were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously			0
' the newlyweds were offered a £ 137 refund but mrs @entity55 said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough ' loss ' to warrant compensation			1
she said : ' it was n't about the money , but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband			0
' it was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more			0
they said " we all make mistakes and we are only human "			0
' that 's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone 's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man 's dying wish and the most special day of our lives , that attitude is not acceptable			0
' the wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to @entity50 , which is based at @entity51 ( pictured ) in the city centre , where the pair said their vows the family has since received an apology from @entity241 , which runs the register office based at @entity51			1
a spokesman said : ' i 'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to mrs @entity177 as the ceremony did not meet her expectations			0
' these types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious			0
they understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple 's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding			2
' however , tragically , mr @entity7 died on january 4 this year before receiving the apology			2
his wife added : ' @entity7 was determined not to die over @entity261 because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come , and he did n't want that for us			2
the energy it took from him to hang on , i could n't believe			0
