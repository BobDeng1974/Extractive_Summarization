secretary of state @entity0 ' is delusional ' if he expected to claim the @entity1 agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they did n't and get away with it , says the chairman of the @entity8 , @entity7			1
' i think @entity0 tried to come back and sell a bill of goods , hoping maybe that the @entity1 would n’t say much about it , ' the @entity10 lawmaker told radio host @entity15 during his thursday program			1
@entity7 , responding to the supreme leader of @entity1 's proclamation yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is ' instant , ' said he had ' sympathy ' for @entity1 ayatollah @entity24 , because @entity0 ' must have known ' what the perimeters were for a long - term accord ' and yet chose to interpret it in another way			1
' launching a rare attack from his official @entity36 @entity35 account , president @entity32 's spokesman @entity31 in turn said it was ' naïve and reckless ' for @entity7 ' to believe every word of the @entity41 's political speech			1
' ' he should n't , ' @entity31 added			0
and the president 's deputy national security adviser told reporters traveling with the administration abroad that it 's ' very clear and understood that sanctions relief will be phased			2
' secretary of state @entity0 ' is delusional ' if he expected to claim the @entity1 agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they did n't and get away with it , says the chairman of the @entity8 , @entity7 @entity0 , is flanked here by president @entity32 and national security adviser @entity54 at the bilateral meeting between president @entity32 and @entity58 president @entity57 today in @entity59 , @entity58			1
the @entity32 administration is in @entity58 to attend the @entity61 of the @entity62 ' the fact of the matter is , we have framework , ' @entity63 said , according to the @entity68			0
' the president has said if the details do n't bear out , we wo n't have a deal			0
' @entity32 , @entity0 , national security adviser @entity54 and other members of the president 's kitchen cabinet are in @entity58 for the @entity75			2
backed into a corner by reporters , the @entity36 on monday indicated that negotiators left @entity79 last week without coming to an agreement about the pace at which sanctions would be removed			0
the administration had stated in a fact sheet that nuclear - related sanctions would be ' suspended ' if @entity1 complied with the terms of the deal			1
the president said in a live statement they would be ' phased ' out over time			0
the framework , however , he said would remain in place so sanctions could be snapped back into place if need be			0
@entity1 's foreign minister , @entity95 , immediately cast a cloud over the @entity98 's assertions , pointing out that the statement released by the @entity101 ' negotiating partners made no reference to either the gradual lifting of sanctions			2
@entity95 indicated that his country was under the interpretation was that sanctions would be ' terminated			0
' asked the next day about @entity95 's claims , the lead spokeswoman for the @entity109 shrugged them off and said she was n't too concerned with how @entity1 leaders sold the deal in their own country			0
barraged with questions at his monday briefing about who was lying - the @entity101 or @entity1 - @entity36 press secretary @entity31 suggested that the timing of sanctions relief remained a topic of discussion - a major revelation given the dispute 's potential for derailing a written agreement			1
@entity24 reaffirmed on thursday his country 's vow not to sign an agreement unless negotiators kowtow to @entity1 's demands and promise the ' instant annulment of all sanction , ' according to a translation			2
@entity1 president @entity135 similarly said , ' we will not sign any agreement , unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal			2
' @entity24 further stated @entity1 would not allow an ' unconventional inspection or monitoring			2
' ' foreign monitoring on # @entity1 's security is n’t allowed , ' he said on @entity35			0
speaking to reporters in @entity58 today , @entity63 also dismissed @entity1 officials ' rhetoric about the agreement as spin			0
' they have their own hardliners who are skeptical of this deal , ' he said			0
' the test of whether or not that framework can be memorialized is not a comment on any given day by an @entity1 leader , the test will be if by the end of june we have a document			0
' responding to the supreme leader of @entity1 's announcement yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is ' instant , ' @entity7 , above , said he had ' sympathy ' for @entity1 ayatollah @entity24 , because @entity0 ' must have known ' what the perimeters were for a long - term accord ' and yet chose to interpret it in another way ' @entity7 ripped into former colleague @entity0 on @entity15 's radio show for mischaracterizing preliminary talks with @entity1			1
' it ’s probably in black and white that the @entity24 is probably right , ' @entity7 said			2
' @entity177 , the @entity179 senator said , ' i think you ’re going to find out that they had never agreed to the things that @entity0 claimed that they had			0
' ' so in a way , i ca n’t blame the @entity24 , because i do n’t think they ever agreed to it			1
' @entity10 senator @entity10 on thursday said , ' it ’s increasingly clear that @entity1 , in fact , failed to reach agreement with the @entity101 and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement			1
' at best , @entity1 agreed to disagree with the @entity101 on key nuclear weapons - related issues and to continue talks , ' the @entity195 lawmaker said			1
@entity7 told @entity200 's behavior ' reveals that a number of things ' about his ' negotiating capabilities and also his candor with the @entity101 people			0
' he also said he believes @entity8 @entity10 are ' extremely close ' to winning enough @entity207 ' support to push through a veto - proof bill giving @entity209 the power to review the formal deal with @entity1 that is scheduled to materialize by june 30			1
@entity24 further stated that @entity1 would not allow an ' unconventional inspection or monitoring ' even with out that legislation , @entity7 claimed that the @entity8 has the @entity215 authority to reject an accord because it is technically treaty			1
@entity32 should ' read the @entity218 of the @entity101 , ' @entity7 said			2
this is clearly a treaty			0
' and even if the president ' disregards the @entity218 ' @entity7 said - ' which he certainly did with executive orders concerning immigration ' - @entity209 should have a say in an issue of this scale			0
@entity228 senator @entity227 , a member of the @entity8 who is exploring a presidential run , said in a statement friday afternoon that ' the @entity24 and president @entity32 appear to be talking about two separate agreements			1
' unfortunately , i ca n’t say i ’m surprised , ' he added			1
' president @entity32 wants a deal way too badly , and his administration has been trying to sell a deal which may not actually exist			2
' @entity227 said the @entity32 administration should tell @entity1 ' in no uncertain terms – that should we come to an actual agreement between both parties , sanctions relief will not be immediate			1
' ' any realistic agreement must preclude sanctions relief from being granted until @entity1 proves it has ended its military nuclear program			1
' drawing on @entity24 's comment about supervision , @entity227 said he would ' never ' lend his support to a deal that does n't allow for inspections ' anytime and anywhere			0
' with ' @entity1 ’s history of cheating , ' he said , ' it would be incredibly dangerous not to require @entity1 to abide by an ‘ anytime - anywhere ’ inspections regime			0

@entity0 ' is delusional ' if he expected to claim the @entity1 agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions when they did n't and get away with it , he said
