travelling to work by @entity0 diaries are private places — places where the writer can take off whichever mask they put on to face the world and let their naked selves run around for a while			1
‘ i make no apology for exposing my doubts and fears , ’ declares @entity0 at the start of his third volume of diaries			1
yet , for the most part , the private @entity0 turns out to be a lot like the public one			1
if you ’ve gone through life under the impression that he ’s a fundamentally decent , cheery , ever - so - slightly bland sort of chap , then you wo n’t find much evidence here to the contrary			1
@entity0 is publicly known as a comedian but the former @entity27 star has also enjoyed a career presenting travel documentaries occasionally , though , you catch a glimpse of something else , and the shock is so great that you find yourself wondering if there just might be another more complicated , less likeable @entity0 lurking in the shadows			1
at the start , he ’s about to embark on his first big jaunt — @entity37			2
a comparative novice as a presenter , he worries about how much contrivance is involved in trying to be himself on camera			2
‘ i try to be as natural as possible , and yet time and time again i have to act			2
i can act — i can act — but i ca n’t act me			0
’ @entity0 , pictured with fellow @entity43 @entity42 and a cardboard cutout of @entity45 , whose death deeply affected @entity0 by the end of the decade , he ’s an acknowledged telly star , winning @entity49 in 1998 and being presented with @entity49 @entity50 — for @entity51 — by none other than @entity53			1
‘ @entity53 is small , bony , her face white and waxy , her handshake cool but a little damp at the same time			0
’ but however successful @entity0 has become , an air of melancholy still creeps in around the edges			1
some of the best writing here , both spare and vivid , is about death			0
@entity0 was with his great friend and fellow @entity43 , @entity45 , when he died in 1989			1
‘ a single tear emerges from his right eye and rolls down his cheek			0
the great ridge of @entity68 is still			2
there is no more noise from him			0
’ a few days later @entity0 and the other pythons attend @entity45 ’s funeral			1
at the end , after the congregation has sung @entity74 , he sees @entity76 sitting silently , his eyes full of tears			0
‘ that i shall remember for a very long time			0
’ four months later , @entity0 ’s mother dies of a stroke			1
‘ the little body is crouched round like the @entity82 , but her strong face remains beautiful though sallow now and silent			0
i bend and kiss her and thank her for giving me life			0
’ what becomes increasingly clear is that like a lot of comedians @entity0 takes himself very seriously			1
he has a seemingly inexhaustible appetite for praise , solemnly quoting someone telling him that his play , @entity92 , ‘ will be around in 200 years ’ even though it ’s just been given a terrible pasting by the critics			0
and while he can be fiercely self - critical , he does n’t stint when it comes to giving himself a congratulatory hug			2
referring to his series @entity98 , he writes : ‘ it is the @entity100 episode , number four , which i think will become a classic			0
’ there ’s also a faint but unmistakable lordliness about the way he soaks up compliments			0
at a drinks party @entity0 is introduced to the novelist @entity108			1
it turns out that @entity108 is ‘ a big enthusiast of my work , [ he ] recognises special qualities of naturalness and ease which he finds affecting			0
’ the @entity43 reunited ( from left to right ) @entity0 , @entity116 , @entity45 , @entity117 and @entity76 at the same time it ’s plain that @entity0 drives himself extremely hard			1
in the rare gaps between jobs , he always seems to be discussing other projects , some so strange that they sound like things @entity123 might have dreamed up — ‘ an interesting film idea , ’ he notes			0
‘ a proposal that i should be seen in the @entity126 trying to track down @entity127 ; using his songs as clues			0
’ amid this furious activity , his famous niceness wears intriguingly thin in places and an altogether bitchier @entity0 shows through — as when he refers to @entity133 as looking ‘ for a brief moment , like @entity76 in drag ’			1
what ’s clear , too , is how close — or closely tethered anyway — the @entity43 have always remained			1
scarcely a year goes by without some talk of a reunion and while it never happens , no one appears particularly resistant to the idea			0
@entity0 is particularly proud of his achievements with his television travel documentaries the surprise , in retrospect , was how long it took			1
that said , there are frequent quarrels too , mainly over the running of their film company , @entity151			0
after one meeting , @entity0 finds himself thinking glumly that @entity153 might be a better name			1
but even when relations are strained , he ’s fiercely defensive of the @entity43 and does n’t try to hide how irked he is that they ’ve never received any official recognition			2
‘ i can only assume the @entity43 are on some sort of blacklist , otherwise the group ’s work would have been recognised as having as universal an effect on tv comedy as the @entity164 did on music			2
’ the message is unmistakable : here is a man who longs to hear the words ‘ @entity170 ’ ringing in his ears			0
meanwhile life goes on , albeit in what now seems like an absurdly sepia - tinged fashion			2
in december 1991 , @entity0 tries to master the new word processor his wife has just bought him and which takes up half the room : ‘ @entity178 and smooth , an easy keyboard , no paper to insert , no crossing out or @entity181 - ing ’			1
it all adds up to an awkward mix. although there are some revealing and affecting passages here , there is also a lot of flannel , as well as entries that do n’t really hack it on any level — saturday , may 6th 1996 : ‘ @entity195 has been sacked as @entity194 captain			0
’ like @entity0 ’s tv documentaries , his diaries slip down easily enough , but seldom touch the sides .			2

@entity0 was with his great friend and fellow @entity43 , @entity45 , when he died in 1989 and write about it *poignantly*
his mother also died four months later
@entity0 comes across fundamentally decent , cheery , ever - so - slightly bland
the @entity206 won @entity49 and his *programme* @entity51 was awarded @entity208 in the 1990s
