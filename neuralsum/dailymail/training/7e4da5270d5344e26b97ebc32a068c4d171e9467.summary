@entity1 sen. @entity0 joined in on @entity3 sen. @entity2 's annual ' airing of the grievances ' on @entity5 this year , playfully suggesting that the @entity7 lawmaker shed his curly locks ahead of his probable presidential campaign			1
@entity2 , a likely but unconfirmed @entity10 contender , was sending the tweets as part of the fictional ' @entity14 ' holiday , made popular in the 1990s ' @entity16 ' sitcom when he teased @entity17 for not retweeting him more often			1
@entity0 responded in kind and said he had only one grievance for his colleague in the @entity21			2
plus if running for a higher office u 'll be far more aerodynamic , ' he joked			0
earlier in the day @entity2 had mocked the media for obsessing over his hair and questioning the authenticity of his curls			1
the two senators of opposing political parties have bonded over their support for criminal justice reform @entity2 is an unconfirmed presidential contender but is expected to join a broad @entity7 field in the coming months , but he could just be referring to his @entity21 re-election bid after @entity2 teased @entity0 for not retweeting him more , the @entity1 senator - who is bald - mocked @entity2 's curly hair ' the hair is real & mine			1
do n't know why ur fascinated with it or compare it to alien life forms , ' he tweeted along with a photo of himself with his hair circled in red			0
@entity0 and @entity2 are on opposite sides of the political divide but they have bonded in the @entity21 over their support for criminal justice reform			1
after his initial tweet sharing his artificial grievance with @entity0 , @entity2 noted that in the past year the two had ' discussed hemp , med marijuana , crim justice reform			1
some of that has now passed , all of it we 've worked on together this year			0
' @entity2 added , ' my grievance there though remains the same			2
not enough looking for agreement in @entity71			2
@ @entity72 and i will keep trying			0
' @entity0 also followed up his lighthearted message with one that was serious in tone			2
' @entity2 , in honor of # @entity14 , here 's to u & i with our colleagues showing a true feat of strength & passing crim justice reform , ' he said			1
' @entity14 ' is a made - up secular holiday that the cantankerous ' @entity16 ' character @entity85 forced on his family each year two days before @entity87 as an alternative to @entity87 and @entity89			1
its celebration , he explained on the show , included a @entity14 dinner during which people told their family members ' all the ways they 've disappointed you ' during the year			1
instead of a tree or menorah , the @entity85 family erected an unadorned silver ' @entity14 pole			2
' the day - long event also included ' feats of strength ' and ' @entity14 miracles ' – which were ordinary events with simple explanations			1
earlier in the day @entity2 had pondered the media 's obsession with his hair and confirmed its authenticity @entity2 's grievances included ribs at his political opponents , including @entity3 secretary of state @entity114 , outgoing @entity115 and @entity116 sen. @entity116			1
in a tweet directed at @entity114 , who unsuccessfully challenged incoming majority leader @entity118 in the last election and will likely challenge @entity2 in the next one , @entity2 made of the @entity17 for refusing to acknowledge her support for @entity123 during her last campaign			2
' i am still wondering who @ @entity126 voted for , ' he said , facetiously			0
@entity2 also rubbed salt in @entity131 's election - inflicted wound , tweeting , ' to my friend @ @entity133 , wishing you a long and fruitful tenure as minority leader # sorrynotsorry ' as a result of @entity7 gains in november @entity131 was demoted and @entity7 @entity139 ascended to the @entity21 's top leadership post			1
@entity2 mostly left his @entity7 colleagues alone , save @entity116 , who he has been feuding with for the past week over the @entity143 policy			2
' tempting to air a grievance @ @entity145 again , but we 've done that enough for this week			0
instead i will say an early @entity87 , ' @entity2 said , laying down his sword in the holiday spirit			1
taking a jovial tone , @entity2 joking griped that ' no matter how many times i ask [ @entity139 ] he wo n't let me borrow this awesome sweater vest			2
' ' we all know having a fashion forward campaign is important to success , as [ former @entity155 sen. @entity154 ] showed us in 2012 # festivus , ' he said in a tweet accompanied by a photo of @entity154 on the campaign trail			0
@entity2 's ' airing of grievances started with a jab at incoming senate majority leader @entity118 's fashion sense before he posted his own @entity164 shirt did a @entity166 senator just announce he 's running for president on @entity5 , or is he toying with us ? @entity3 @entity7 @entity2 tweeted this photo on tuesday but what started as jabs about sweater vests worn quickly switched on @entity71 's buzz machine when @entity2 added a photoshopped pic of a turtleneck sporting a ' @entity176 ' slogan			1
' of course , everyone has to be themselves , and i have my own style , ' he tweeted			0
' i think this will be a popular item this year			0
' many who follow the senator on @entity5 took him seriously			2
' strangest way to announce you 're running for president , achieved , ' tweeted one user			0
' if @entity2 just announced his presidential campaign vis a vis a @entity14 rant , i have to vote for him			1
no choicem , ' wrote another			0
but others noted that @entity2 is also up for re-election to the @entity21 in two years			0
asked whether the senator was really making a campaign announcement about the presidency , a @entity2 spokesman wrote back – complete with a smiley - face emoticon : ' senator @entity2 is running for the @entity21 in 2016 :-) ' ' @entity199 got a lot of problems with you people ! ' : @entity2 quoted @entity85 , a ' @entity16 ' character , who berated his family members around the dinner table two days before @entity87 on ' @entity16 , ' @entity85 , the crusty father of @entity206 , created @entity14 as an alternative to @entity87 and @entity89 he has signaled , however , that he could run for both the @entity21 and the @entity10 simultaneously , a prospect that @entity114 has said she will try to block			1
@entity114 lost her own @entity21 bid to @entity139 in november by a 15 - point margin			0
' the law is clear , ' she told @entity212 a week ago			0
' you ca n’t be on the ballot twice for two offices			0
' ' at the end of the day , we ’re not going to be bullied , ' she pledged			0
@entity114 herself could be a @entity21 front - runner if @entity2 were forced to choose and picked a presidential bid over running for a second six - year term in @entity223			1
making a big political announcement on social media is n't unprecedented			0
last week former @entity227 gov. @entity226 used @entity228 and @entity5 to declare that he was launching a presidential exploratory committee .			0
