during the @entity2 period 470 million years ago life on @entity1 thrived , but why ? it 's a question scientists have struggled to answer , but now an ancient meteorite found in a quarry in @entity7 could be the missing link that explains what happened			1
the fossilised space rock is thought to be the remains of one of two asteroids that crashed between @entity16 and @entity17 , the debris of which later bombarded @entity1 and kickstarted the variation of life			1
scientists say they may have found the ' missing link ' that explains the biodiversity of life on @entity1 470 million years ago			1
the ' mysterious object ' ( right ) was found at the @entity24 in @entity7 ( left )			2
the meteorite is 8 × 6.5 × 2 centimetres in size			0
it was found in the youngest quarried bed of the @entity30 quarry the find was made at @entity32 , where about 100 other fossil meteorites have also been found before			0
the @entity2 period covers the time on @entity1 between 485 and 443 million years ago			1
during those 45 million years the area north of the tropics was almost entirely ocean			1
most of the world ’s land , meanwhile , was part of a southern supercontinent called @entity44			0
the period is synonymous with a general biodiversity of life on @entity1 - in the early @entity2 period life on @entity1 thrived			2
the reason for this is unknown , but some theories suggest the arrival of meteorites such as the l chondrites could have kickstarted the resurgence			0
it was n’t all fun and games during the @entity2 period , though - towards its end massive glaciers formed on @entity44 as it shifted towards the @entity60			0
this drained shallow seas and caused sea levels to drop , ultimately resulting in the mass extinction of 60 per cent of marine invertebrates on @entity1			0
another theory for the mass extinction , however , suggests a ten - second gamma ray burst blasted @entity1 ’s atmosphere , exposing life to deadly levels of radiation			2
the international team of researchers in their paper published in @entity1 and @entity76 , however , say this particular rock is unlike anything ever found			2
and it could be the ' missing link ' for an asteroid collision that had previously been thought to have been vapourised			2
over 500 million years ago a small asteroid crashed into a larger one between @entity16 and @entity17			1
this impact resulted in the creation of many fragments that eventually bombarded @entity1 470 million years ago			1
these fragments are known as l chrondrites , and they are the second most common type of meteorite on the planet			1
it 's believed these impacts may have kickstarted the resurgence of biodiversity on @entity1 , when life became more varied and complex			1
this occurred during the @entity2 period , prior to which biodiversity had gone through a lull			0
however , while the meteorites are thought to be the remains of the larger asteroid , scientists had been puzzled as to why there was no sign of the smaller asteroid			2
until now , no evidence of the other asteroid had been found on @entity1 , putting a damper on the theory			1
some had suggested the second asteroid simply vapourised on impact			0
the find was made at @entity32 , where about 100 other fossil meteorites have also been found before			0
the international team of researchers in their paper published in @entity1 and @entity76 , however , say this particular rock is unlike anything ever found the meteorite is thought to be the second of two asteroids that collided between @entity16 and @entity17 470 million years ago			1
evidence for the larger one has already been found in the form of l chondrite meteorites , the second most common meteorites on @entity1 , but this new find is the first evidence for the other asteroid in the collision the meteorite found in @entity7 has reignited interest , however , because it 's possible it is a piece of that second asteroid , as it appears to have been part of the same meteor shower as the l chondrites			1
if true , it will add a great deal of credence to the entire theory that seeks to explain the sudden resurgence of life during the early part of the @entity2 period			2
the meteorite was found by quarry workers three years ago			1
other meteorites have been found in the same quarry before , but all of them were l chondrites			0
this new rock was different from the others the researchers noted after studying its crystals , but was in the same rock layer and dating in the lab , suggesting it arrived during the same time period as part of a wider meteor shower			0
while still in the same class of primitive achondrites as l chondrites , it 's not exactly the same because of small differences in its elemental composition			0
the team is hopeful that the finding suggests that others will be found , hopefully some that can offer more evidence of their origin			0
the unique meteorite has not been given an official name yet - for now it 's simply being referred to as the ' mysterious object '			0
and it could just be the missing link that explains one of @entity1 's greatest mysteries			1
the asteroid collision resulted in the creation of many fragments that would eventually bombard @entity1 470 million years ago ( illustrated ) , called @entity183 , the second most common type of meteorite on the planet			1
it 's believed these impacts may have kickstarted the resurgence of biodiveristy on @entity1 the @entity2 period covers the time on @entity1 between 485 and 443 million years ago			1
during those 45 million years the area north of the tropics was almost entirely ocean			2
most of the world 's land , meanwhile , was part of a southern supercontinent called @entity44			0
illustrated are squid - like @entity199 from the period			0

scientists in @entity7 have found a rock that may explain @entity1 's biodiversity
the discovery is thought to be one of two asteroids that collided in space
these asteroids crashed into each other between @entity16 and @entity17
the larger of the two formed l chondrites , the second most common type of meteorite on @entity1
these are also thought to have kickstarted the *biodiviersity* of life on @entity1 470 million years ago
no evidence for the second asteroid had been found , though , calling the theory under *scrutiny*
but this new find could be the first evidence for the other in the collision
