@entity0 produced a storming final leg to win @entity3 gold for @entity5 's men in the 4x400 metres relay			1
the 19 - year - old , competing at his first senior major championship , picked up the baton in second , but passed @entity11 and @entity13 's @entity12 with 200m to go and , just when it seemed he had saved nothing for the finish , managed to hold off @entity17 of the @entity18 to take the title			2
the quartet , which also featured @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , came home in three minutes 00.46 seconds to win by 0.05secs at a drenched @entity26			1
cruising : @entity0 crosses the line to win the 4x400m relay final at @entity26 is that a smile ? @entity0 looks confident as he beats @entity17 ( left ) on the line the @entity5 quartet were missing @entity33 , who finished fourth in the individual , but his absence was not felt			2
@entity0 's performance continues his meteoric rise from complete unknown to world - class one - lap runner			0
he came into 2014 with a personal best from indoors of 48.76secs , having been predominantly a 200m sprinter , but has stepped up in distance and he proceeded to batter that time into oblivion			0
his @entity46 went down to 45.80s in may and then to 44.97 at this very stadium last month			0
get me a flag ! @entity21 laps up the acclaim after @entity5 pulled off a shock victory we 've done it ! @entity0 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 pose for photographs afterwards in between times he was disqualified at the @entity56 , but he has bounced back in some style			1
his split on saturday night was timed at 44.56			0
raw emotion : the quartet could n't believe it after @entity0 pipped the @entity18 on the line it 's a team game : the @entity5 women 's relay squad ran on to the track in order to congratulate the men			1
