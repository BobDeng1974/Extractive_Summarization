' a @entity14 spokesman said : ' we take the safety of children very seriously and school crossing patrols exist to make sure children can cross roads as safely as possible			1
' to do this they must hold out the lollipop with one arm and hold their other arm outstretched to signal that all traffic must stop , this is well established signalling that should be understood by all drivers			0
