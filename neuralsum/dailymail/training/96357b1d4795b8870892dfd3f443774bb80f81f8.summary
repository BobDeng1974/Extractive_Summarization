from across the ocean , an @entity1 woman inspired an obese @entity4 alcoholic to lose 365lb , ditch the alcohol and embrace life in just over a year			1
to distract himself from the depression that saw him drinking heavily each night and eating to fill the void , @entity8 man @entity7 played @entity12 , a @entity13 - inspired app , which matched him randomly with opponent @entity14 in @entity15 in the spring of 2012 @entity7 was 30 , morbidly obese , and an alcoholic , with nagging medical problems that were only getting worse			1

when he was n't drinking , he was eating			2
' my typical fast - food meal was a double cheeseburger with a large pop and large fries , ' @entity7 writes in his blog			1
