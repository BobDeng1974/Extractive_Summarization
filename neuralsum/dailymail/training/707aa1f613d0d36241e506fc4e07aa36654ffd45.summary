the amphibian - version of @entity1 appears to be a hit with these leopard frogs			1
a recent video shows the creatures in a frenzy after discovering an @entity7 at the back of a shed			2
footage of wiggling worms is then played to the crowd of hungry frogs who leap , pounce and hurl themselves at the glass			1
it shows an iphone placed behind a sheet of glass			2
a clip of worms is then played on the device to a crowd of frogs throughout the video , the crowd increases in size and at one point there are more than 17 frogs all scrambling to get the best view			1
and it ’s lucky the phone is shielded , because frogs have been known to pull three times their own body weight using just their tongue			0
while worms are part of their staple diet , leopard frog have also been known to eat other small frogs , and their large mouths can even swallow small birds and snakes			1
the video , which already has 12,000 hits on @entity20 , was uploaded four days ago by @entity53 - based @entity21			1
' quite a crowd gathers only moments after i put it on their favorite channel ! ' mr @entity21 wrote on his @entity61 page			2
' i had to put the glass cover over it or they kept changing the channel			0
' throughout the video ( grab pictured ) the crowd increases in size and at one point there are more than 17 frogs all scrambling to get their tongues on the worm			1
and it ’s lucky the phone was shielded , because frogs have been known to pull three times its body weight using just its tongue the leopard frog is most often recognised as the specimen used in science classes for dissection			1
their name comes from the pattern of irregularly shaped dark spots that cover their backs and legs			0
they are greenish - brown in colour with a white underside and light - coloured ridges on either side of their backs			0
the frogs can reach lengths of three to five inches ( 7.6 to 12.7cm ) with the males slightly larger than females			0
while worms are part of their staple diet , leopard frog have also been known to other small frogs , and their large mouths can even swallow small birds and snakes			1
it is n't the first time the animal kingdom has become engrossed in video footage			0
a recent study found monkeys in the wild not only love watching videos , but they also tend to copy the behaviour seen on screen			0
when scientists showed marmosets footage of a monkey opening a box to get a banana , they were able to replicate what they saw and open the box themselves			0
the study , undertaken in @entity129 , @entity130 , revealed new insights into how monkeys learn from each other in the wild , according to @entity136 and @entity137 researchers			0
while leopard frogs may be more enticed by flickering lights than footage of worms , scientists believe wild monkeys could prove that ' how - to ' videos work just as well in the wild			1
‘ how - to ’ videos have been a success when shown to monkeys in captivity , but this is the first time they were used to train creatures in the wild twelve of the marmosets were able to open the box , 11 of which had seen it done first in a video			2
one monkey could do it after just seeing the still image			0

the video was uploaded to @entity20 by @entity53 - based user @entity21
it shows an iphone behind glass playing a video of wiggling worms
at one point , more than 17 leopard frogs scramble to get best view
as well as worms , leopard frog sometimes eat small birds and snakes
