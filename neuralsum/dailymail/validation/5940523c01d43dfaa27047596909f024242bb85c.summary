' four of @entity9 's most prized cover - ups include a lion design that was transformed from some squiggles into a fierce inking			1
@entity9 says he transforms ' plain bad ' ones , adds to some - like this seemingly unfinished lion tattoo - or makes dated ones more modern more straightforward renovations include a robin playing card , left , which @entity9 re-vamped by changing it into a sparrow and adding a border , right speaking about the renovation work , he said : ' the lion was done by an amateur artist and because it was only partially done , it was possible to salvage it and cover it up			1
' he also worked his magic on a faded design by transforming it into a bold and colourful rose			0
another botched design he fixed was a faded @entity28 inking			0
' the cover up worked because the client researched a design he wanted , his original @entity28 was faded and the new design had lots of detail and shading so lent itself well to a cover up , ' said @entity9			1
he also worked his magic on this faded design by transforming it into a bold and colourful rose , right more straightforward renovations include a robin playing card , which @entity9 re-vamped by changing it into a sparrow and adding a border to give a splash of colour to the new piece			1
' the cover - up process depends on various factors like the size of the tattoo , how faded it is and the density of the dark pigments in it as darker colours are harder to cover , ' he explained			2
' the amount of clear skin around it is also a consideration as this can open up the opportunity to incorporate the cover - up in a bigger piece			0
the placement of the tattoo on the body can also be a major factor in whether or not a cover up can be done			2
