@entity7 , who was cleared of a string of child sex offences this week , said @entity10 also ' refused ' to take evidence that the @entity13 star had a cache of child porn			1
later ms @entity7 was herself accused of possessing indecent images of a child , sending vile pictures to the singer and demanding that he send her illegal pornography			1
but following a trial at @entity23 , a jury found the 39 - year - old not guilty on all charges after she claimed she was trying to entrap her former lover and trick him into revealing his crimes			0
the court heard that she reported @entity45 to the authorities in 2008 , 2009 , 2011 and 2012 to raise the alarm over his child sex crimes			1
she told police he had sent her images of a ' very young girl being raped ' , but they refused to examine her phone or computer , the jury was told			2
today she said she had tried to contact @entity58 ' chief constable @entity57 in 2011 , which was passed on to other officers who she claims failed to properly investigate her claims			1
speaking about her ordeal on @entity65 's @entity64 she said : ' i reported the images that he 'd sent me , i went straight to the chief constable in 2011 , and was in touch with a detective sergeant who i had previously dealt with			1
' i kept asking how i was going to get these images to you , and then three more times after that i took my laptop into the police station and they refused to take it			2
and finally when one of the officers did see the images they swore blind it was over 16 - i was so confused , thinking ' no it is n't '			2
and told me to get on with my life			0
' she added , ' it was literally like walking into a wall			0
and from the documentation i 've now had disclosed to me from the @entity90 - there is actually a note from one detective sergeant and it says " although the images are alarming , we 're reluctant to investigate because it would be high profile and would create a lot of press interest "			0

two women were jailed alongside him for assisting his crimes			0
ms @entity7 , from @entity109 , told the jury during her trial that she reported @entity1 to the police , but they ignored her because she was a prostitute who was regarded as a ' nut job '			1

the prosecution had claimed that she was obsessed with the singer , and would do anything to fuel his desires , but the jury acquitted her			0
she said : '' i do n't feel anything at the moment because i 'm still a bit numb from it all			0
