by @entity1 reporter heartbreaking dilemma : @entity3 , 63 , says she was declared a ' suppressive person ' by the @entity5 for not ending her relationship with her apostate son @entity3 , a one - time high - ranking member of the @entity5 , claims she was given an impossible ' @entity8 ' by her superiors that ended up tearing her close - knit family apart			1
according to mrs @entity3 , 63 , from @entity12 , church elders pressed her to sever ties with her son , @entity14 , who was accused of being connected with @entity16 apostates			1
when the woman refused to willingly ' disconnect ' from her renegade son , as church teachings dictate , she was put on trial at the @entity16 compound in @entity23			2
according to @entity3 , who had been a devout scientologist for more than three decades , she was presented with a choice : she could either turn her back on her son , or become a pariah and be estranged from her daughter			1
' you 're giving me @entity32 's choice , ' @entity3 reportedly said at her trial in july , as @entity34 reported in its detailed expose			0
the @entity5 defines the practice of ' disconnection ' as the act of breaking ties with a person who is hostile to the teachings of @entity41 , and whose antagonism could impede the spiritual progress of those around him			0
according to the organization 's website , there are two ways of dealing with a ' suppressive person ’ who wishes to harm the church : one either ' handles ' the troublemaker by presenting him with factual data about @entity16 , or ' disconnects ' from the person by refusing to communicate with him			1
the latter technique is described as a ' last resort ' that is to be employed only when all other attempts to ' handle ' the ' suppressive ’ fail			0
in his writings , @entity41 compared ' disconnection ' to the way the broader society deals with criminals			0
‘ in other words , they remove the guy from society and put him in a prison because he wo n’t handle his problem or otherwise cease to commit criminal acts against others , ’ the @entity16 founder explained			0
rebel with a cause : @entity3 's son , @entity14 , ran into trouble with the @entity5 when he started communicating with known apostates ; as a result , he became a pariah @entity3 's choice : @entity3 was presented with a choice : she could either sever all ties with @entity14 ( far left ) , or face the possibility of being shunned by her daughter and granddaughter ( right ) it is important to note that the @entity5 stresses that there is no policy on the books that requires congregants to disconnect from family members and friends who hold different beliefs			1
' the @entity5 encourages excellent family relationships , @entity97 or not , and family relations routinely improve with @entity16 because the scientologist learns how to increase communication and resolve any problems that may have previously existed , ' the statement on @entity103 reads			2
but according to mrs @entity3 , she was forced to cut ties with her own son , who was labeled a suppressive person - or ' @entity108 ' - for his ties to @entity16 whistle - blowers - or face the possibility of being alienated from her daughter , @entity112			1
in the end , @entity3 , who had reached the highest rank in the church hierarchy , refused to turn her back on @entity14 and was ejected from the community that she had been a part of for 36 years			1
@entity3 first became interested in @entity16 in her late 20s when she sought spiritual counselling – known as ‘ auditing ’ in @entity16 parlance - following a painful break - up			2
as time went on , @entity3 became increasingly drawn to the religion , quickly rising through the ranks of the organization , marrying a fellow scientologist and raising her two children , @entity14 and @entity112 , in the church			2
following her divorce in the late 1990s , @entity3 married another scientologist , @entity130			0
together , the couple attained the highest level of spirituality known as @entity134 always faithful : both @entity3 and her second husband , @entity136 , refused to turn their back on @entity14 ( far left ) , even as his sister , friends and even his biological father ' disconnected ' from him as punishment for his subversive activities @entity3 ’s daughter , @entity112 , was also an active member of the church who followed in her mother 's footsteps by marrying a second - generation scientologist			1
the couple have a young daughter			0
everything was going well for the family until @entity3 's son , @entity14 , began running into trouble and breaking church rules			1
growing increasingly skeptical of @entity16 , the renegade teenager began spending time with known critics of the church , among them @entity160 and @entity161 , who had been shunned for leaking damaging information about the inner workings of the religious organization to newspapers			0
when news of @entity14 's affiliation with the circle of apostates became known to church officials , he was forced to stop communicating with them			1
in response to the pressure from the community , the 22 - year - old turned to alcohol and drugs			0
he entered a @entity16 rehab center and returned home clean , but soon renewed his acquaintance with a church defector			0
fall from grace : last year , the once - elite members of the @entity5 were declared ' suppressive persons ' for their refusal to turn their back on @entity14 when the elders caught wind of @entity14 's behavior , he was punished by being labeled a ‘ suppressive person			1
’ the consequences were disastrous : one by one , @entity14 's sister , brother - in - law , childhood friends and even his biological father turned away from him			2
but his mother and her husband stood by his side			0
at first , church officials encouraged the @entity201 to try and ' handle ' their wayward offspring by bringing him back into the fold			0
@entity14 told @entity34 that he had made a good - faith effort to reconcile with the church by turning his back on the enemies of @entity16 , revealing information about their activities and taking re-education courses in a bid to lift his ' suppressive person ' classification			1
despite his efforts to make things right with the church , @entity14 felt that @entity16 officials were stone - walling him			2
he finally stopped trying to get back into the good graces of the powerful organization			0
things came to a head in the summer of 2012 , when an increasingly anxious @entity130 asked his stepson to move out of their house			0
@entity14 responded by getting drunk and threatening to end his life			0
the church continued ratcheting up the pressure on the @entity201 to disconnect from the malcontent young man , but @entity3 said in no uncertain terms that she would not turn her back on her child when he was at his most vulnerable			2
during her trial several weeks later , a tearful mrs @entity3 declared to the judges : ' i 'm not leaving my son			1
' over the next few months , mrs @entity3 devoured news reports about allegations of wrongdoing against high - ranking church officials , doing so in violation of a strictly enforced policy that prohibits its members from looking up @entity16 on the @entity245			1
finally , in july 2013 , @entity246 and @entity3 received a letter from the church declaring the couple ' suppressive ' for refusing to disconnect from @entity14			2
within hours , the woman 's world came crashing down when her daughter , @entity112 , confronted her and said that her entire family , including @entity3 ’s only granddaughter , must disconnect from her			0
mrs @entity3 , 63 , told the paper that her final message from her daughter came in the form of an email asking her not to contact her again until she makes things rights with the church .			1

@entity3 , 63 , and her husband were declared ' suppressive persons ' by the church for refusing to sever ties with her son , @entity14
@entity14 was ousted from @entity16 for having ties with known apostates and whistle - blowers
' @entity274 ' doctrine dictates that @entity97 must stop communicating with *people* who seek to harm the church
mrs @entity3 's devout daughter ' disconnected ' from her mother over her refusal to turn her back on her son
@entity3 had been part of the church for 36 years and reached the top rank of @entity286
