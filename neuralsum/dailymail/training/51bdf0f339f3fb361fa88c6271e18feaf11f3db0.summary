@entity0 is currently playing for @entity1 on loan from @entity3			1
the defender was captain at @entity5 but fell out of favour towards the end of last season and moved out on loan to @entity10 in october			1
a product of the famed @entity13 academy at @entity14 , @entity0 has also played for @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
the defender also has 15 caps for @entity21			1
in his second appearance in the @entity24 ’ @entity22 , he talks about last season at @entity3 , @entity21 ’s terrible @entity26 and his hopes for the future			1
things can go up and down in football really quickly as i discovered at @entity3			1
if someone goes and someone else comes in [ @entity34 was replaced by @entity35 in april ] with a different mindset your situation changes			2
you can see the difference between the way it was and the way it is			2
but i 've dealt with it			2
it ’s now in the past and i do n’t want to go in to the situation again			2
it is part of my career			2
@entity0 gets to grips with @entity50 of @entity51 in an @entity53 tie with @entity3 last season @entity0 shadowing @entity56 striker @entity55 during a @entity58 match at @entity59 @entity0 celebrates scoring for @entity3 at @entity60 back in november 2012 with @entity61 of course it was disappointing to see @entity3 relegated and i was sad not to play in the games near the end			1
as regards the future , i do n’t want to think about it			1
when the time comes , i will talk about it			2
i am just enjoying playing regularly , i am grateful for the chance and i want to be 1,000 per cent focused for @entity1			1
it 's been so far , so good at @entity1			1
i 'm really happy here , especially after not playing for a while			0
i 'm enjoying competing at the top of the championship			0
we are an attacking side and when we are performing we are capable of scoring plenty of goals			2
i do n't know what will happen when my loan ends in january			1
i will talk to @entity3 and i will talk to @entity1			1
for the moment , i am just trying to focus and get my rhythm back			0
@entity1 have a really ambitious owner who is trying to do good things			1
step - by - step we are getting there			2
we all want to do well and i feel we are on the right path			0
@entity0 ( left ) in action for new club @entity1 against @entity90 striker @entity89 @entity1 are flying high in the @entity74 , one of a cluster of teams with promotion ambitions it 's always difficult when the club is changing managers , as happened at @entity1 earlier in the season , but as players you have to cope with it and the squad here has coped really well			1
all you can do is focus - you know what you have to do and that 's win games			2
it ’s a bit awkward when you have four managers but this happens in football			0
it can be very short - term for managers these days			1
the @entity26 left every citizen of @entity21 disappointed about the results and the incidents that happened			1
it went against the @entity21 culture and you ca n’t defend what is indefensible			1
the @entity123 people could not wait for it all to finish			0
if i am to get my place back in the national team , i do need a run of games			2
that did n’t happen for me before the @entity26 and i did n’t get picked			1
but it is not a big deal			0
@entity21 and the national team is in my dna and i am always available to them			1
@entity21 's defence stands motionless as @entity138 's @entity137 celebrates in their 4 - 0 @entity26 win @entity139 sees red in @entity21 's @entity26 group match with @entity138 in @entity142 bassong in action for @entity21 against @entity144 at the last @entity26 in 2010 the championship is a very competitive division			1
there are many , many teams who could go up			0
it is very physical and it is demanding because you are often playing saturday then tuesday then saturday			0
the pace and the level is different to the @entity58			0
i can understand why many players can struggle with the intensity			0
at @entity1 , we are trying to find that consistency week - in , week - out , get back to the top and open up a gap			1
i did find it physically tough at first as i had to get my body used to playing every week again			0
with the games so close together , it is important to get enough rest but i like the fact that the busy schedule allows the players to bond			0
@entity169 came here with a winning mindset , a mindset that suits the club and that is shared by the players too			0
we play from the back and like to play good football			0
he ’s not against me going forward either ! @entity169 has enjoyed a fairly successful start to his tenure as @entity1 manager @entity180 has found the going tough at @entity0 's old club @entity17 this season @entity0 closes out @entity182 's @entity181 during his @entity17 days it can only improve at @entity17 – they have a great squad and manager			1
it is 50 - 50 when someone new comes in and @entity180 had an alright start			1
but things can very quickly change and not go so well			0
but they ’ll get back up there			0
@entity192 look really , really strong in every area from the goalkeeper to the strikers			0
they have experience , strength , style and quality			0
they will be confident they can go the entire season unbeaten but the magic of the @entity58 is that there is a long way to go and anything can happen yet			2
which defenders do i admire ? @entity210 at @entity211 is very , very talented and still so young			0
i also really like watching @entity212 at @entity213			0
@entity0 is a big admirer of the @entity211 and @entity216 defender @entity210 @entity212 , of @entity217 and @entity213 , has also impressed @entity0 @entity0 's former @entity17 team - mate @entity218 has enjoyed an excellent start to life at @entity211 @entity218 has had an outstanding impact at @entity211			1
he is a part of @entity211 now despite the pressure of his transfer fee			0
for me , his first season was amazing			0
few leave the country at all but he did and he is learning @entity228 and on the pitch he is just flying			0
he is doing his part , scores great goals and has had a special impact			0
there were loads of rumours about the threat of @entity237 at the @entity238 but it is good that the tournament had now been moved to a safe place for the players and the fans			2
the likes of @entity245 will always be the favourites but sometimes you can get a surprise – look at @entity249 when they won in 2012			0
i hope that @entity21 can do well , they will go there and try to win it			1
after the difficulties of the last six months , i just want to stay healthy and play week - in , week - out			2
if i can stay injury free , i believe i ’ll do well and my team will do well			0
my future is a little bit cloudy and i may have to go back to @entity3			1
but it ’s not in my hands , let ’s wait and see			0
stay at @entity1 ? why not			1
i am enjoying my football here and why would i want to leave when i ’m having fun ? @entity263 brings fans top - flight @entity266 football from the @entity58 , @entity53 and @entity268 alongside @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity272 ’s @entity271 , @entity216 ’s @entity273 and the @entity275 @entity274			2

the @entity21 defender is currently on loan at @entity1 from @entity3
he lost his place in the @entity3 side and they suffered relegation
@entity0 went on loan to @entity1 at the start of october
he admits his long - term future is still up in the air
@entity0 was n't picked for @entity21 at the @entity26 in @entity217
but he describes their *performance* as ' embarrassing '
