@entity0 is seen as a tiny speck surrounded by an enormous magnetic ' bubble ' surging through space in this image released by @entity5			1
far from the usual view of a blue and green globe spinning peacefully in the solar system , the dramatic picture illustrates the speed and energy of the magnetosphere that surrounds @entity0 as it moves around the sun. scientists studying data collected by @entity5 's wind spacecraft have used it to create a more detailed snapshot of the way solar particles streaming in from the sun bounce off the bubble			1
a complex system of charged particles from the @entity24 and magnetic structures piles up in front of the @entity0			1
scientists now hope to better understand this area in front of the @entity31 shock , known as the foreshock , as it can help explain how energy from the rest of space makes its way into the magnetosphere @entity5 researchers have been examining data from @entity16 - which travelled through the region at the boundary of the magnetosphere 17 times between 1998 and 2002 - to find out more about the ' dramatic ' changing conditions within the complex , turbulent system called the foreshock			1
as the magnetosphere ploughs through space , it sets up a standing bow wave or bow shock - much like that in front of a moving ship			0
the foreshock lies just in front of this bow wave			0
conditions in the foreshock change in response to solar particles streaming in from the sun , moving magnetic fields and a host of waves sweeping through the region , according to @entity5			1
@entity65 , deputy project scientist for @entity66 at @entity5 's @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , explained how ' cool squiggles ' she stumbled upon in the data ' turned out to be a special kind of magnetic pulsations called short large amplitude magnetic structures , which we call @entity76 for short '			0
studying the region around these ' rogue waves ' and how they propagate may help to establish what accelerates narrow jets of charged particles back out into space and away from @entity0			2
serene : @entity0 , seen here in a less dramatic image , ploughs through space surrounded by a giant magnetic bubble known as the magnetosphere @entity89 , a space scientist at @entity91 who is co-author of the paper , explained how space weather events that seem small can have ' profound effects downstream ' , from affecting gps satellites to prompting solar storms			1
' the front of the magnetosphere is right in the line between sun and @entity0 , so it 's a crucial place to understand which small things can lead to big results , ' he said			2
' what happens to @entity0 's magnetic field depends on what 's happening here at the front of the bow shock			0
' and what 's happening there is dramatic			0
' it 's going to affect how much energy moves into the magnetosphere			0
once inside the magnetosphere , it can create powerful solar storms and impact communications and gps satellites that we depend on daily			0
' according to @entity5 : ' the more we know about what happens in the frothy , turbulent area in front of @entity0 , the more we know about how the solar wind and other material bursting off the sun may be able to penetrate into near @entity0 - space			2

@entity0 is surrounded by giant bubble known as the magnetosphere
scientists created dramatic picture to show how solar particles bounce off
