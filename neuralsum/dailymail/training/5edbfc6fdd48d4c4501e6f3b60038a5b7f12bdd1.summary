the archbishop of @entity1 says vicars should avoid preaching ' moral claptrap ' about being nice in their sermons adding @entity6 's message is as radical as a call for violent revolution			1
speaking at an event in @entity11 , where he delivered a homily , the most reverend @entity9 called on people to ' get their hands dirty ' if they are to tackle inequality in society			1
he said that the old sermons he often heard while growing up @entity19 , all urged people to be nice , but he explained that @entity21 would n't allow his followers to accept this given that the ' weak ' are often excluded from society			1
the archbishop of @entity1 , the most reverend @entity9 , who says vicars should avoid preaching ' moral claptrap ' about being nice as @entity6 's message is as radical as a call for ' violent revolution ' mr @entity9 also explained that the message of @entity6 could be mistaken for a call to ' violent revolution ' if it was n't for the religion 's emphasis on peace			1
he was visiting @entity11 to speak at the ' @entity37 ' conference organised by the @entity38 at @entity39 on the city 's @entity40 in the heart of the financial district			1
in a speech , published online by @entity45 , he told the congregation : ' @entity21 does not permit us to accept a society in which the weak are excluded , whether because of race , wealth , gender , ability , or sexuality			1
' nor did he permit us and does he permit us to turn religion into morality			2
' the old sermons that we have heard so often in @entity19 , which i grew up with , which if you boiled them down all they effectively said was : “ would n't the world be a nicer place if we were all a bit nicer ? ” ' that is the kind of moral claptrap that @entity21 does not permit us to accept			1
' mr @entity9 was speaking at an event at the @entity39 on @entity40 , @entity11 , pictured , which was focusing on inequality in society he then said that the church has mistaken the way in which they should challenge such inequality saying it began to turn into an ' exclusive little tribe			1
' the archbishop then explained that if were n't for @entity21 being described as the ' @entity21 ' , @entity6 would almost be a call to a ' violent revolution '			1
he added : ' we are , by contrast , as @entity78 to be caught up in a revolution of expectation and of implementation			2
' were it not for the fact that he is in title @entity21 , and lived out his mission in service and foot - washing , ending it in crucifixion and resurrection , this would be a call to violent revolution			1
' he also spoke of his experiences of living in @entity95 , where he was @entity97 of the city 's cathedral for four years			1
he told of how the former @entity101 , @entity100 worked together with his @entity103 counterpart @entity102 to tackle appalling poverty in the city			0
the archbishop 's latest comments come after he has been repeatedly outspoken about deprivation in @entity110 cities and how the gap between the rich and the poor is becoming wider since taking up the post in 2012			2
just last week , mr @entity9 , a former oil trader , spoke out about pay inequality telling all employers they should pay the living wage			2
he said that most businesses can afford to pay the living wage - which is at least £ 1.35 an hour more than the minimum wage , saying firms should : ' just get on with it			0
' he added : ' it can be done , it should be done			0
' meanwhile last year the archbishop appeared to be on course to clash with prime minister @entity127 after calling on him to reverse his decision not to take @entity130 funds to boost @entity110 food banks			2
talking about his experiences of visiting @entity133 , where he saw starving children , and then returning to the @entity110 to see a similar situation involving a young family , he said : ' i was talking to some people - a mum , dad and one child - in a food bank			0
' i found their plight more shocking			0
it was less serious , but it was here			0
and they were n't careless with what they had - they were just up against it			0
' it shocked me that being up against it at the wrong time brought them to this stage			0
there are many like them			0
but we can do something about it			0
' in 2013 , he also warned against dismissing all people on benefits as scroungers and challenged government claims that people were using food banks simply because they were there			0
he said it was important that ministers do not use ‘ derogatory language ’ to describe people who are poor .			0
