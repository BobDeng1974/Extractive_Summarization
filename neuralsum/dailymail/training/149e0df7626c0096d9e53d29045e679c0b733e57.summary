a @entity1 couple unwilling to destroy their frozen embryos that went unused following fertility treatments chose to adopt them out to a like - minded family suffering from similar woes			1
@entity8 and @entity9 of @entity10 were blessed with two sets of twins with the help of in vitro fertilization -- they also had 11 unused frozen embryos carrying their dna			1
since they believe life begins at conception , simply getting rid of the embryos was out of the question			2
sharing the git of parenthood : @entity24 and @entity25 adopted frozen embryos from a family across the country who had 11 left over following successful @entity29 who did not want to destroy them @entity24 and @entity25 across the country in @entity32 , @entity33 -- another @entity35 couple desperate to be parents			1
the @entity37 had wanted an embryo and the @entity39 had too many			0
soon after @entity42 became pregnant with a third child -- this one an unassisted ' miracle baby ' -- she and her husband signed away the 11 frozen embryos to the @entity37			1
' we have been blessed with three when we did n't think we 'd have one , so , what kind of awesome thing is it to bless another couple and let them experience the same kind of joy we did ? ' @entity46 told @entity54			0
after the @entity39 had identical twins @entity56 and @entity58 , they paid a few hundred dollars per year to store the 11 leftover embryos			2
the @entity37 gave birth to @entity61 two years ago with an egg implanted in @entity25 's womb that was donated from the once they were blessed with an unexpected third child conceived naturally five years later , they decided three was enough			1
there are two major embryo ' adoption ' agencies , @entity66 out of @entity69 and the @entity70 of @entity71			0
both groups cater largely to people like the @entity37 and @entity9 whose decision to ' adopt ' an embryo is faith - based			2
' it was kind of like a joining of hearts , ' @entity25 told @entity54			0
the @entity39 ' twins are now 8 and have met the eldest @entity25 kid , @entity61			2
the two families exchange photos on @entity83 and the kids even spend time together on @entity85			0
meanwhile , having been blessed with the two children they always wanted , the @entity37 have actually returned the remaining embryos to the @entity39			0
the @entity39 , in turn , have identified yet another family with whom they can share the joys of parenthood			0
the @entity37 ' two children have a relationship with the @entity9 twins via @entity85 and @entity83 and the couple even gave back the remaining embryos , which the @entity39 plan to ' adopt ' out to another @entity35 couple			1

@entity8 and @entity9 of @entity10 , @entity1 believe life starts at conception and found a like - minded couple who also had fertility woes
they signed over 11 embryos to @entity24 and @entity25 of @entity32 , @entity33 after successfully conceiving twins and having unassisted ' miracle baby '
the @entity37 have since had a *son* named @entity61 , now 2 , and *daughter* @entity110 , 9 mos. from the donated embryos
