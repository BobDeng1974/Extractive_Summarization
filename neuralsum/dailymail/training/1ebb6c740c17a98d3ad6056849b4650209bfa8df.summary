her underwear collection was the fastest selling in the group ’s history and the one shining element from a set of distinctly grey sales statistics from @entity5			2
miss @entity6 ’s relationship with @entity11 has worked remarkably well for both parties since the fashion label ’s chief creative director , @entity48 , first picked her as the face of the brand in 2008			1
