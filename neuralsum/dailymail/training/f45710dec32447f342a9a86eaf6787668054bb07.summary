by @entity0 have you ever wanted to see what lies at the bottom of the sea ? well , now you can , thanks to a live stream provided by the @entity7 ( @entity7 )			1
they ’ve unveiled the real - time video footage from a new deep - sea mission , letting you ride along for the rest of the expedition			2
live footage immediately below last week the @entity15 vessel set out on its expedition			2
until 1 may it will be mapping and observing a region in the @entity19			1
here it has also been deploying a remotely operated vehicle ( @entity22 ) named @entity23			1
this is the third part of a 59 - day expedition that is gathering data from areas of special interest on the sea floor identified by the scientific community			0
february 24 – leg 1 mapping transit from @entity32 , @entity33 , with transit mapping operations conducted en route to the @entity19			1
march 4 – primary mapping operations started at the southwest @entity37 in the @entity19			1
march 15 – leg 1 in @entity40 , @entity38 concluded			0
march 19 – the @entity15 departed @entity40 to begin @entity41			0
march 20 – started primary leg 2 mapping operations in the @entity44			1
april 3 – concluded leg 2 in @entity46 , @entity47			0
april 10 – @entity46 and commenced transit to the @entity51 operating area			1
april 12 – @entity52 3 remote operating vehicle ( @entity22 ) dive			0
april 24 – last @entity22 dive in @entity44			0
april 26 – first @entity22 dive at the @entity57			0
april 31 – last @entity22 dive of @entity48			0
may 1 – ship arrives in @entity61 , @entity37 ; leg 3 ends			0
these areas are being mapped by the @entity15 while the @entity23 dives underwater to observe interesting features			2
these will include cold seeps , deep coral communities , undersea canyons , shipwrecks and possibly also mud volcanos and brine pools			0
‘ despite its importance to @entity76 national energy , food , transportation and recreational economies , and decades of exploration ; significant gaps remain in our basic understanding of the deep @entity19 , ’ the @entity7 says of the expedition on their website			2
‘ in recent years , scientists and managers have identified poorly known areas in the @entity19 that are larger than the states of @entity88 , @entity89 , and @entity33			0
’ ‘ the 2014 @entity90 continues @entity7 ’s efforts with partners to reduce the unknown by conducting baseline ecosystem characterizations to support a variety of research , management , economic , and educational activities			1
the data collected by the expedition will , according to the @entity7 , be used to provide critical deep - ocean baseline environmental intelligence to governments , universities , corporations , non-governmental organizations and the public			2
‘ our collaborative exploration approach utilizes telepresence technology to stream real - time video and data ashore , ' the @entity7 continues , ' allowing scientists , engineers , managers , and students to work together efficiently to characterize sites , learn from one another across disciplines , and share knowledge and new discoveries with anyone watching on the @entity122			2
’ via telepresence , live images from the seafloor and other science data will flow over satellite and high - speed internet pathways to people around the world the 2014 @entity90 is divided into three ' legs ' that aim to map the sea floor using the @entity15 's deep - water mapping systems			1
the third leg started on 10 april and will continue until 1 may the @entity15 , pictured , was previously a @entity135 but in 2010 it was converted into an exploratory vessel for the @entity7 the @entity7 's @entity137 has previously stumbled across remarkable finds such as this mid- 19th century wooden - hulled shipwreck that was found on the @entity51 seafloor in 2012 this picture from the 2011 @entity141 shows a remote operated vehicle ( @entity22 ) being recovered from the water at night , with the underwater glow created by the powerful lights on the @entity147 camera sled that is also currently being used on the 2014 @entity90			1

an expedition to explore the @entity51 seafloor has begun
the @entity7 is providing a live feed from their remotely operated vehicle
the @entity23 is *performing* mapping operations underwater
it is also observing the area , and it has found shipwrecks in the past
the 2014 @entity90 will conclude on 1 may
