@entity0 says @entity3 's humiliating early @entity2 exit has been ' consigned to history ' as they continue their road to recovery			1
less than four months have passed since @entity8 's men trudged back from @entity9 with the worst record of any @entity3 side to appear at the finals			1
@entity3 were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1958 , with a record of two losses and a draw seeing them end up with their lowest - ever @entity2 points tally			1
@entity0 was @entity3 's best player against @entity19 as he ran the game from midfield in @entity22 the @entity24 playmaker says @entity3 have put their disappointing @entity2 run behind them uncomfortable questions continue over that failure but those involved in the national set - up are only interested in the future , with a fourth straight win in @entity19 on sunday - making it three wins out of three in the @entity33 qualifying campaign - helping that healing process			1
' it is credit to the manager and his coaching staff that the @entity2 is consigned to history , ' @entity3 midfielder @entity0 said			1
' the first meet - up after the @entity2 , we went through it and that was it			2
' maybe the game against @entity45 ( a 2 - 0 win in @entity47 last month ) helped where people did n't expect us to do much but we went there and showed we have still got the quality that is required for this level			1
' we have pushed on from that game now and we are looking forward			0
we are taking each game as it comes and we 'll look forward to the next ones			0
' @entity0 played in @entity3 's group matches against @entity55 and @entity56 at the @entity2 the @entity3 were dumped out of the tornament early in @entity9 after losing their first two matches the 1 - 0 win in @entity22 was harder work than it should have been , with @entity19 - ranked 81st in the world - reduced to 10 men for the majority of the second half			1
@entity3 were wasteful in front of goal and @entity0 knows he should have opened the scoring before a @entity69 free - kick maintained their 100 per cent start to qualification			1
' we are happy with the win but we are happy with the performance as well , especially in the first half , ' the @entity24 midfielder said			1
' we dominated the game , we stayed on top of them			0
we knew it was n't going to be as easy as @entity81 ( who @entity3 beat 5 - 0 last thursday )			1
this is a well - organised team			2
' we were away from home on a different pitch to what we are used to , but i thought we did well			0
' we created chances , and we probably should have scored a few more but we are happy with the win			0
' @entity0 was quick to praise game - changing captain @entity69 afterwards , with his 74th - minute set - piece making up for his other missed chances at the @entity93			2
' that 's the sign of a world - class player , ' he said			0
' he had a few opportunities but when it comes to those sorts of moments of magic , he can produce them			0
@entity0 praised @entity69 after the @entity3 captain scored @entity3 's winner against @entity19 ' he has done it throughout his @entity3 and @entity105 career			1
he has still got it and we are lucky to have him			0
' @entity69 may have got the goal and @entity109 again voted fans ' man of the match , but @entity0 was the stand - out player on a cold night in the @entity114 state			2
again deployed at the base of the diamond , the 22 - year - old broke - up the play as well as providing an attacking outlet - all part of the 4 - 4 - 2 diamond which helps @entity3 to become a ' horrible team to play against '			2
the 22 - year - old says he is getting used to playing in a deeper role for @entity3 and is improving every game ' i said after the @entity45 game i am only going to get better in this role , ' @entity0 said			2
' it is a little bit difficult because i do n't play it for my club			0
' i am used to playing a different role but that 's what i spoke about after the @entity45 game , doing your homework , watching players who play in that role and learning from them			0
' i am feeling better and better as each game goes on			0
i am starting to get a little bit of an understanding with @entity69 and his runs			0
if he keeps making those runs , he is going to beat the goal record			0
' @entity69 took his senior international tally to 43 on sunday evening , one behind third - placed @entity145 in the all - time @entity3 goalscorers list .			1
