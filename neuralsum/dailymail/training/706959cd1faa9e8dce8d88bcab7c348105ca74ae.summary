by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 17:28 est , 29 december 2012 second chance : @entity3 - @entity2 was first told her cancer was incurable a @entity6 woman has become one of the first to benefit from pioneering surgery that uses tissue taken from a cow ’s heart to rebuild the liver			1
the operation brings the possibility of whole donor organs being taken from animals – known as xenotransplantation – ever closer			1
@entity3 - @entity2 , 42 , from @entity18 , was diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer in october 2010			1
doctors initially told her she could not be cured			2
but two months later , she underwent a procedure to remove the tumour in her liver along with a large portion of her @entity26 ( @entity26 )			2
this major blood vessel is positioned close to the back of the liver and returns blood from the lower half of the body back to the heart			1
the @entity26 was then reconstructed with a patch made from the outer lining of a cow ’s heart , a material called bovine pericardium			1
‘ art form ’ surgery the procedure is likened to an art form by @entity44 , consultant hepatobiliary surgeon at @entity45 , @entity18			2
‘ this was a long and complex procedure and is offered only in a handful of places around the world , ’ he says of the operation , called a right hepatic trisectionectomy with enblock resection of the @entity26			0
‘ there are only five centres in @entity56 with experience in such cases			0
to date about 150 patients have been treated worldwide			0
the bovine patch has been used in heart surgery for a while but employed in just six liver surgery cases , four of which we ’ve performed			1
’ according to mr @entity44 , what makes @entity3 ’s operation so specialist is the use of this bovine material , as well as the fact so much of the @entity26 was removed			1
‘ usually , if the @entity26 needs reconstruction , a plastic - type synthetic material rather than the natural bovine material has been used , ’ he says			2
however , this carries a higher risk of infection and also of blood clots forming after surgery			2
‘ with the bovine material , the risks are dramatically reduced , ’ he says			0
‘ patients avoid the need for long - term use of drugs to thin the blood , which have side effects			2
the bovine material is pre-treated and has gone through chemical processes to remove the risk of infection , which means it is as close as you can get to the @entity26 , without taking part of another human vein			0
’ why use a @entity96 ? ‘ the material is a similar thickness , it ’s flexible and easy to cut to shape and suture in place , ’ says mr @entity44			0
‘ synthetic materials tend to be more rigid			0
and if the synthetic material becomes infected , it will need replacing			0
‘ the bovine material becomes a part of the patient and will last as long as they do			0
the choice of synthetic or bovine material comes down to an assessment made by the surgeon			0
we find it seems to work without any problems			0
’ each year in the @entity6 , 3,400 people are diagnosed with primary liver cancer , when a tumour originates in the liver			1
the outlook is often poor			0
pioneering work : how the liver and the blood vessel was removed and the tissue from the cow 's heart put in its place to form a new blood vessel liver cancer usually presents with few symptoms and most cases are detected once the cancer is advanced			1
there are different types of primary liver cancer but possible symptoms can include jaundice – this causes the skin and whites of the eyes to go yellow – discomfort in the stomach , weight loss , and loss of appetite			1
suitability for surgery depends on various factors , including the size and position of a tumour and whether the liver is damaged by cirrhosis ( scarring )			1
but for some , it can offer the chance of a cure			0
pain in the @entity158 @entity3 visited her gp after experiencing a pain in her side , similar to muscle strain , for a couple of weeks			1
doctors thought she may have gallstones , but the pain persisted and later scans revealed the worst			0
indeed , by the time @entity3 ’s cancer was diagnosed , her tumour was 6in in size – though fortunately it had n’t spread elsewhere in her body – and she was told by doctors that it was inoperable			1
but after her case was referred to the specialist liver surgery centre at @entity175 , mr @entity44 , along with surgeon mr @entity176 , offered her a surgical solution			1
mr @entity44 says : ‘ as we had experience of this kind of surgery , we thought we could help her			2
as it turns out , her operation was life - changing			2
’ cattle aid : the tissue from the cow is of similar thickness as the original blood vessel and is more flexible than synthetic materials a ten - hour operation @entity3 , who is married and works as a health director for @entity192 , says : ‘ the surgeons told me about the procedure and explained they could give it a try , but they did n’t know if it would work			1
it was my decision , and i wanted to try something rather than do nothing			0
’ during the ten - hour operation , performed under general anaesthetic , mr @entity44 and mr @entity176 removed 80 per cent of @entity3 ’s liver			1
as the tumour was wrapped around the tubular @entity26 , three - quarters of the vein had to be removed			2
‘ the liver is the only organ in the body with the ability to regenerate , ’ says mr @entity44			1
‘ over three months , the piece of remaining liver regrows to its original size			2
but you have to try to recreate the structure of the @entity26			0
imagine a can of drink : if you cut a hole in the side , three - quarters of the way around the can , then one side is intact and the rest is open			0
you have to try to close that gap and this bovine material acts as a wall			0
’ eleven days after surgery , @entity3 left hospital			1
three months later , she was back at work			0
and less than 18 months on , she is cancer - free			1
‘ i made a joke about mooing when i found out about the bovine material , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ but i ’m thankful it was used			0
i know i ’m very lucky			0
i have scans and blood tests quarterly , so i live each three months at a time			0
‘ i recently raised £ 42,000 for charity and i want to continue to fundraise to increase awareness of liver cancer and also to raise awareness of my surgeons and the hospital , because if it was n’t for them , i would n’t be here			1

@entity3 - @entity2 , 42 , had been told her liver cancer was incurable
she was saved by xenotransplantation - animal organ donation
the surgery saw tissue from a cow 's heart used to *re-build* her liver
