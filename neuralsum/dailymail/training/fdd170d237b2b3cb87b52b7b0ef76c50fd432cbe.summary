by @entity0 the alien world of @entity2 is more than 365 million miles away from what we experience on @entity5			0
but despite this huge distance , astronomers have long believed the gas giant ’s gravity is so strong it deflects comets and asteroids that would otherwise hit our planet			0
now a new study has shed light on how this strong gravitational pull may have influenced @entity5 's climate and , in turn , created the conditions needed for life to thrive on our planet billions of years ago			2
astronomers have long believed @entity2 ’s gravity helps deflect comet and asteroids that would otherwise hit our planet			1
now a new study has shed light on how @entity2 may have helped create the conditions for life to thrive on @entity5 billions of years ago @entity2 ’s gravity , which is 2.5 times stronger than that of @entity5 's , is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own			1
this means that , depending on how @entity2 interacts with @entity5 , our planet 's orbit - and therefore its climate - could vary significantly			1
for example , if our planet is pulled closer to the sun , our climate would change as a result			0
equally , if @entity2 's orbit caused @entity5 to move further away			1
the study , by the @entity46 and @entity47 , ran various computer models of our solar system , according to a report by @entity52 in @entity53			0
with each iteration , the planets in the solar system remained in their place while @entity2 moved around in different obits , ranging from circular to elliptical			2
@entity2 ’s gravity , which is 2.4 times stronger than that of @entity5 , is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own			1
this means that , depending on how @entity2 interacts with @entity5 , our planet 's orbit could vary significantly , changing how close it is to the sun the gravity of @entity2 is 2.5 times greater than @entity5 's			1
in the 1990s , its force tore apart @entity71 9 and pulled the broken pieces into the planet			0
the gravity of @entity2 affects every planet to some degree			0
it is strong enough to tear asteroids apart and capture 64 moons			0
some scientist think @entity2 destroyed many celestial objects in the ancient past as well as prevented other planets from forming			0
astronomers have long believed that the gas giant ’s gravity helps deflect comets and asteroids that would otherwise hit our planet the scientists also moved the entire orbit of @entity2 inwards and outwards to test what would have happened if the planet had formed closer to the sun , or further away			2
each simulation was taken through a million year time frame , recording where @entity5 would have been every 100 years as a result of @entity2 ’s position			2
‘ the default assumption is this is something that is important , ’ said @entity100 , an astronomer and astrobiologist at the @entity102			0
‘ there 's a lot of flexibility where @entity2 will be , and you would assume that you 'd have a very smooth , very gentle variation in how the @entity5 's orbit behaves over time			2
’ while @entity2 's locations resulted in little change in @entity5 's orbit and tilt , the effect on @entity5 's climate remained unclear			1
however , a previous study by the same research group found that @entity2 's position has a striking influence on @entity5 's climate			1
the team now hope to go back to the earlier work to resolve the discrepancy			0
by understanding how gas giants affect the climate on other worlds , researchers hope they can better narrow the search for other habitable planets outside the solar system .			1

@entity2 ’s gravity is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system
computer simulations looked at how @entity2 's orbit would affect @entity5 's
position in *relation* to the sun , and therefore our planet 's early climate
it found it had no affect on tilt and orbit , but affect on climate was unclear
findings from study could help astronomers better narrow the search for habitable planets outside the solar system
