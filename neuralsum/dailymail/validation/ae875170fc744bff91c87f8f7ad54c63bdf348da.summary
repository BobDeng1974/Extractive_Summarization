a @entity1 news anchor got a real earful during a live broadcast on monday when an exotic insect got so cozy on his ear that he laid two eggs			1
@entity8 's @entity7 was broadcasting from the @entity10 's @entity9 for a story on @entity12 when a palm - sized @entity13 unexpectedly landed on his head			1
largely unfazed , @entity7 continued with his broadcast			1
when he was done , he discovered the the exotic bug had left behind a gift			0
he had no clue it had happened until after the broadcast the moth had previously caused @entity7 a bit of a tickle , which he at first appeared to believe was a bite			1
however , the insect zookeeper @entity7 was interviewing informed him that @entity37 do n't have mouths at all and are thus incapable of biting			2
their plump , green larvae , the zookeeper explained , do all the eating			0
the moths then live off the fat stores once they become adults			2
' @entity47 on my ear on live tv laid two eggs ! ( yuck ) , ' @entity7 tweeted monday			1
@entity52 and beautiful : the @entity13 measures around 4 inches across with tail - like structures dangling majestically from its wings			2
the moth likely laid hundreds more eggs after the two he left behind on @entity60 perhaps that sensation he thought was biting was actually the moth laying her eggs			0
either way , the moth wo n't be around long enough to see if @entity60 helps raise her young			0
the @entity47 , unable to eat , lives only a handful of days			0
she does , however lay hundreds of eggs -- just a few at a time -- before she dies .			0
