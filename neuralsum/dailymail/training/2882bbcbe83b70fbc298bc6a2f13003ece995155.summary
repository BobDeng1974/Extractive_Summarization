a 100ft - wide sinkhole that is so deep the bottom can not be seen at one end has appeared overnight just yards from a farmer 's house in @entity5			2
@entity6 , 71 , says his partner @entity7 , 39 , first discovered the hole on thursday morning , adding that it has been growing ever since			1
and mr @entity6 now fears that heavy rain forecast for the coming days could be about to make the situation even worse			1
a 100ft - wide sinkhole appeared overnight on wednesday in the @entity13 and was first spotted by @entity7 , 39 , as she was walking her dogs the next day farmer @entity6 , 71 ( pictured ) , says the hole is so deep you can not see the bottom at one end and has been getting bigger every day mr @entity6 fears that with heavy rain forecast for the coming days the land around the hole could collapse even further mr @entity6 , 71 , who lives in @entity21 , near @entity22 , @entity5 , said : ' i am not sure where this will end			1
' the hole is still growing			2
if you could have heard the bangs , crashes and rumbles when it first happened you would understand how terrifying it was			0
' my partner @entity34 had been walking one of our dogs when she she found it on our land around 80 metres away from our house			2
' the land is surrounded by a sheep farm and there are two or three around at the moment			2
if a sheep was to fall down the hole then that would be the end of it			1
it would be the same for our two dogs			0
you would n't be able to get to them or even see them			0
' mr @entity6 believes the collapse could be linked to 19th - century iron or lead mining in the area , though he has been unable to find evidence of a shaft that may have collapsed			1
the sinkhole appeared just 90 yards from mr @entity6 's farm in @entity21 , near @entity22 in the @entity13 mr @entity6 believes the hole could have been caused by either an iron ore mine or a lead mine , both of which operated in the area in the 19th century mr @entity6 also worries that his dogs or one of the sheep that graze in the surrounding pastures could fall into the hole , as he would be unable to get it out while lead mining started in the @entity13 around 2,000 years ago , commercial operations did n't start until the mid- 1800s and continued until the early 1900s , starting up again for a few years during the @entity78			1
around this time the landscape was littered with chimneys and huge waterwheels that were used to sort useful ore from soil and other scrap , though only a few remain today			0
the mines also produced zinc ore , iron ores , and fluorite also known as fluorspar , though the areas is less well - known for these			0
council workers have been to inspect the site , but are unsure what can be done to stop the hole getting bigger , as it has almost reached a public footpath mr @entity6 , who lives with partner @entity34 , an academic at @entity98 , added : ' from time to to time small holes do open up on our land , but we have never known them to be so big before			1
' some council experts came to inspect the hole yesterday but we are not sure what can be done			0
we are crossing our fingers it does n't get much bigger , but it is approaching a public footpath now			0
' he added that he is working to increase the wild bird population on his land , and hopes that the sink hole will not have a negative impact .			0

farmer @entity6 , 71 , says his partner @entity7 , 39 , discovered the hole on thursday morning
hole has grown since then and because rain is forecast he is worried there could be another collapse
he is also worried that his dogs or one of the sheep that graze in the surrounding pastures could fall in
