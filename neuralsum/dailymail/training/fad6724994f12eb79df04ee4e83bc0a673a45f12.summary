fingers in his ears : the deputy pm was accused last night of ignoring signs a key policy was in chaos @entity22 leader @entity4 and wife @entity23 launched the free school diners policy at @entity25 near @entity26 last year , but critics say it is an uncosted gimmick on monday , headteachers savaged the schools meal plan – for pupils aged four to seven – saying they did not have the facilities to cope with an extra 1.5million lunches			1

@entity12 , former adviser to @entity40 education secretary @entity13 , condemns the idea ‘ officials in the @entity34 were unanimous that it was a bad gimmick and introduced in a way that makes it hard to avoid implementation chaos			1
officials were obviously right , ’ mr @entity12 said			1
he described the £ 150million funding announcement for new kitchens as a ‘ back - of - the - fag - packet ’ calculation from mr @entity4 ’s spin doctors			0
he added : ‘ because @entity4 only thinks about politics ... he assumed that our opposition was because it was a @entity4 idea			2
‘ our opposition was because it is a dumb idea , badly executed , which shows why politicians should have less power over schools			1
’ he had earlier tweeted : ‘ officials warned @entity4 / @entity64 and told them the £ 150million is junk but fingers in ears			1
’ @entity70 of the @entity71 ’ @entity69 said : ‘ there ’s no such thing as a free lunch and @entity4 ’s dog ’s dinner of a policy is proof of that			2
‘ taxpayers are footing the bill for a policy that was about winning applause at conference rather than helping children or families struggling with the cost of living			2
’ mr @entity88 dismissed the claims from mr @entity12 , saying : ‘ what he said about the ex-tory adviser @entity12 backdrop to the introduction of this policy is complete and utter balls			1
the @entity34 was not opposed to this policy , it was the result of pilots undertaken since 2009			1
‘ this stuff from @entity101 reflects his personal views , it does n’t reflect the views of the @entity104 , who i have spoken to extensively about this , including before our policy announcement			0
’ mr @entity4 weighed in with an article on the @entity22 website , writing : ‘ i would love the @entity22 to be able to take all the credit , but the truth is that @entity9 has been looking at this for the last five years			2
‘ this is n’t back of the fag packet stuff			0
the evidence shows that free school meals make a real difference in our classrooms			2
’ but @entity122 said mr @entity12 ’s claims amounted to ‘ very serious allegations which call into question the quality of decision - making in the @entity34 and in the @entity128 as a whole ’			1

‘ what we ’ve discovered is that we ’ll end up with a scenario where every day is rather like a @entity153 lunch			0
‘ i wanted a second canteen so 150 four - year - olds could have a nice pleasant experience at lunchtime			0
now , i suspect , that will become a very busy canteen			0

’ @entity164 , head of @entity165 in @entity140 , said the school needed extra kitchen equipment			0
‘ we do n’t know if we will get the funding yet , so we do n’t know if we can even cook the food yet , ’ he added			0
