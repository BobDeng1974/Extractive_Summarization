for @entity2 , qualification for the @entity1 is not all about the money			1
but there are now 16million reasons for the @entity6 to take @entity7 there by leading the team to a fourth successive title			1
and all of them involve pound signs			2
this week @entity13 confirmed their ‘ cash cycle ’ for the next three years of @entity15 competition			1
the last time @entity7 reached the @entity1 group stage , in 2013 - 14 when they faced @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , they won one match and earned £ 12.6m			1
the same performance – or better – next season would see that sum rise by £ 4m			1
if they reach the last 16 , the figures crash through the £ 20m barrier			1
and that ’s even before ticket sales			2
@entity13 's increase in @entity1 money gives @entity7 manager @entity2 extra reasons to qualify to the rest of @entity37 football , the prospect of @entity7 making more money is damaging to any hopes of increased competition			1
to @entity2 , it ’s a different kind of bind			1
‘ it is even more pressure , ’ conceded the @entity6 as his side seek to stretch their @entity44 lead to eight points against @entity46 in @entity47 tonight			2
‘ but you ca n’t think about money			1
you just have to do the job the best way you can			2
‘ i feel if we can keep consistency in this team and maybe add a player or two , we will be ready for it			2
‘ it ’s not only about the money			2
it ’s about the supporters and the reputation of the club			2
it ’s about the experience of the @entity1			1
’ the experience and the cash effectively go hand in hand			2
if @entity7 participate in the group stages of the premier competition , sell - out crowds of 60,000 – something of a rarity these days – are guaranteed			1
the competition stimulates and sustains the club in a variety of ways			2
yes , the last 32 of the @entity79 secured a tie with @entity81 this season			2
but for all the concerns about a small elite from the major leagues dominating the competition every year , the @entity1 remains the superior competition in every way			1
‘ the @entity1 is so important , ’ added @entity2 yesterday			1
‘ we want to win the league and get into the @entity1 group stage , that ’s the main target			1
‘ there is even more money now in the @entity1			1
so to get a good team to compete in that tournament is everything			2
it is more important than selling players			2
‘ our prime target is the @entity1 and we have to do what is best for the club			1
’ towards that end , @entity2 - now a more confident and assured figure than the man who took the @entity107 job last summer - will assume personal control of the pre-season programme and argue for the retention of key players			1
the days of @entity7 jetting to the east coast of @entity113 and back to play friendlies appear to have gone			1
‘ we have to be more prepared than we were this season , ’ stated the @entity107 boss after insisting that last summer ’s lucrative series of games in the @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 had been partly to blame for his team ’s subsequent 4 - 1 qualifying defeat to @entity125 in @entity126			0
‘ i know we are going to be more prepared			0
they are knockout ties in the qualifiers , so anything can happen			0
‘ we just need to do everything as good as possible so that the preparation is 100 per cent			0
‘ we have to do what is best for the team			0
if we do n’t reach it ( the group stages ) then we will have done everything we can			1
if we are not good enough then we have to look for a new coach then			0
’ he was only half joking , you suspect			0
the most important games of a @entity7 season now take place in @entity144 , before they have kicked a ball in domestic competition			1
the @entity1 qualifiers set the tone for the rest of the campaign			1
amid those circumstances , finding the time to rest international players is proving increasingly difficult			0
@entity154 play the @entity155 in a vital @entity15 qualifier in @entity157 on june 13 , when more than a few @entity7 stars are likely to be involved , while the likes of full - back @entity160 will also be playing for their countries through the summer			1
by this time last year , @entity7 had won the @entity37 title at a canter - allowing former manager @entity165 to grant key players early rest prior to the @entity169 challenge ahead			1
@entity2 says that wo n’t happen this time , even if his side can find a way to shake off challengers @entity173 in the coming weeks			1
‘ no. everybody is going to be here , ’ said the @entity6 boss			0
‘ hopefully we are going to win the @entity178 and that is the main target			0
‘ our dream and hope is to get to the @entity182 and win it			0
if we do that , then we will be playing our last game of this season on may 30			0
‘ after the cup final , the players will get three weeks ’ holiday			0
if they are playing internationals in june , then they will get one week more			0
so players like @entity192 ( @entity193 ) and @entity194 ( @entity195 ) would come back on july 1			0
‘ in three weeks , you ca n’t ruin too much			0
it is just positive for their bodies to rest			0
they know what is coming when they come back to training			0
’ before then , there are big barriers to cross			0
beginning tonight just down the road in @entity47 against a demoralised and struggling @entity46 side who find themselves propping up the @entity44 table			0
@entity2 admits he is eager to secure a fourth consecutive league title for @entity7 as soon as possible ‘ we want to win the league as soon as possible , ’ declared @entity2			1
‘ the games coming up now are important games but we have a good momentum now			0
we play good football , we train well , there is good harmony in the squad			0
i am comfortable that we are going to keep performing well			0
‘ i expect a good performance at @entity46			0
we have a lot of players who have been rested a lot			0
they should be ready for the game			0

@entity7 could earn £ 16million just from competing in the group stages
