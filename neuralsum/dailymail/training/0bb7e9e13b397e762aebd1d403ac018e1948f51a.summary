by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 08:20 est , 6 november 2013 a cyclist says he was treated like a ' burglar or child batterer ' by police after he was arrested for riding his bicycle without lights			2
@entity7 , 38 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , was stopped by officers as he cycled along the pavement on his way home from working as a shop manager			1
police said he was taken to the police station after becoming abusive and then held in the cells before being charged and bailed over long - standing laws on the time of day a bicycle should have lights			1
now the @entity21 has thrown the case out in a hearing that lasted just two minutes			2
' i was treated like a burglar ' : @entity26 in @entity8 , where @entity7 , 38 , of @entity8 , was stopped by officers as he cycled home senior crown prosecutor @entity29 told magistrates at @entity8 just before mr @entity7 was due to enter a plea : ' i am somewhat surprised to see this allegation in court today			1
' ' i do not believe it is in the public interest to continue with this prosecution and ask to withdraw it			0
' justices agreed and defence lawyer @entity39 said : ' that is a common sense approach by my colleague - greater common sense than was shown when my client was arrested and then processed through the custody system in the cells			1
' a police spokesman said the cyclist ' became abusive towards the officer and refused to give his details '			2
file picture mr @entity7 called the arrest , which happened at about 7pm on tuesday october 29 , a ' waste of public money ' adding : ' i was treated like a burglar or child batterer			1
' ok , i did not have my lights on and would have admitted that			0
' i was cycling home in the rain after a busy day			2
i had forgotten to put the lights on my bike because the clocks had changed that weekend			0
' it was a mistake but i found myself being treated like some master criminal on a major drugs deal			0
' ' i had reason to believe the police were over the top arresting me when a caution or fixed penalty would have done			0
' ' i suppose they did not like it when i asked them " have nâ€™t you got anything better to do ? "			0
' a police spokesman said : ' mr @entity7 was stopped on @entity26 in @entity8 for using a cycle without lights at night			1
' he subsequently became abusive towards the officer and refused to give his details and he was therefore arrested and later charged with the offence			0
' he added that mr @entity7 was held for an hour			1
mr @entity7 added : ' i was perhaps a bit sharp but it did not warrant me being taken off the streets and processed through the custody system			1
' i was told by one custody officer in the cells there were 25 others awaiting processing and i would be 26th			0
' ' it 's not been a great time for me as i have just been laid off by the shop			0
but the @entity98 were right			0
it is a victory for common sense and the public purse			1
