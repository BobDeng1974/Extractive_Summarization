by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 nearly every team which reached the last eight of this remarkable @entity4 had nervous moments			1
but none came as close to elimination as @entity8			1
only five minutes remained in the @entity10 oven against @entity11 last weekend when @entity13 ’s right foot kicked new life into the @entity16 challenge and ripped a hole in the hearts of the @entity19			1
@entity21 ’s penalty a few minutes later completed the @entity16 revival but that afternoon led to some introspection within @entity25 ’s squad			1
so we may see a slightly different approach to saturday ’s meeting with @entity29			1
‘ in general , i think we were stronger when we had the ball , so that ’s a plus			2
we have to do that more			2
we let @entity11 play a bit too much			1
in the second half i was on the ball more and i could threaten the opposition going forward			2
that ’s a much nicer feeling			0
’ @entity25 ’s approach to this tournament has been interesting			1
recognising , perhaps , that his squad is not blessed with quality throughout , the incoming @entity57 manager has set @entity8 up to soak up pressure and use the pace of @entity33 and the intelligence of @entity13 and @entity57 's @entity63 on the counter-attack			1
at times it has worked spectacularly , as it did in their opening demolition of @entity68			0
at others - against @entity71 and then @entity11 - it has almost been their undoing			1
at home , question marks are asked constantly of @entity25 ’s approach and it says much for his players ’ faith in him that they adhere slavishly to his instructions			1
demolition : robben shoots and scores during @entity8 's 5 - 1 mauling of @entity68 in the group stage it would appear , though , that @entity8 are preparing to be more proactive at @entity85 on saturday			1
‘ of course in @entity8 we ’re used to playing 4 - 3 - 3 ; attacking football with two wingers , ’ agreed @entity33			1
‘ but i think you also have to look at the quality of the squad			0
that ’s what we did and what the manager did			0
‘ we spoke about it a lot with him and decided to play a slightly different system			0
i think it ’s very functional , maybe not as dominant as we are used to playing , but still very good			0
‘ and we ’ve played four games and scored 12 goals , so that ’s pretty positive			1
positive : @entity8 have scored 12 goals in just four matches at this summer 's @entity4 finals in @entity109 ‘ i think we are on a mission together and when you come to a @entity4 it ’s not to enjoy the weather and enjoy the beach in @entity115			1
you ’re here to win matches and to go as far as possible			2
‘ i do n’t think the expectations were that high before the tournament and as a result we can be very proud of where we are			0
’ certainly there is a sense of purpose among the @entity16 that has not always been apparent in previous tournaments			0
they do , though , occasionally look as if they are a step away from @entity129 will have precious little fear on saturday			2
they have already shown the ability to take down superior opposition and victories against @entity135 and @entity136 were as deserved as they were unexpected			0
the @entity16 will suffer from the absence of the injured @entity139 and it will be interesting to see how they line up			0
against @entity11 , the @entity16 back three looked uncomfortable at times without the former @entity142 midfielder to shield them			2
with @entity33 in the team and in such prime form , however , @entity8 will continue to be dangerous			1
few in @entity8 can remember seeing him play better			2
@entity146 : @entity33 celebrates following @entity8 's dramatic comeback against @entity11 in the last - 16 ‘ i just feel very strong , ’ he said			1
‘ i feel good , i feel fit and i think that ’s the most important thing because i can transfer everything onto the pitch			0
i ’m having a lot of fun and really enjoying it here			0
mentally , i feel really good and , physically , i feel very strong			0
‘ i can play my football and i ’m really happy that i can help the team			0
i think we ( the senior players ) also have the responsibility for the younger guys			0
‘ we try to take them along and i think we ’ve got a good mixture of experience and youth at the moment			0
again , everything we do , we do together and it was beautiful to turn the @entity11 game around as a team			2

@entity33 keen for @entity8 to take charge of saturday 's quarter - final clash with @entity29
@entity8 have set up to soak pressure and hit teams on the counter-attack using the talents of @entity33 , @entity13 and @entity63
@entity25 's side produced dramatic late comeback against @entity11 in the last - 16
@entity8 have scored 12 goals in four @entity4 matches
