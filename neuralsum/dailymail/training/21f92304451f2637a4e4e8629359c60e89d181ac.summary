by @entity0 @entity2 's yakuza gangsters have launched its own website complete with a corporate song and a strong anti-drugs message as its membership falls to its lowest ever level			1
the ' @entity8 and @entity9 the @entity11 ' website has been created by the @entity12 , @entity2 's largest organised crime group			1
it includes shakily - shot footage of members making their @entity18 pilgrimage to a shrine			1
' nothing but @entity27 , that is the man 's way of life , ' say the lyrics			0
' the way of duty and compassion , bearing the ordeal for our dream			0
' another video shows men with crew cuts pounding sticky rice for a @entity18 festival and there are galleries of pictures showcasing the clean - up work members did in the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami and the 1996 @entity53 earthquake			1
the website is not the @entity12 's first foray into media - the crime syndicate last year began publishing a magazine for its members that includes a poetry page , senior gangsters ' fishing diaries and a message from the boss			1
like the @entity67 mob or @entity69 triads , yakuza syndicates are involved in activities ranging from prostitution to extortion and white - collar crime			1
but unlike their underworld counterparts elsewhere , the yakuza are not illegal and each of the designated groups , like the @entity12 , have their own headquarters , with senior members dishing out business cards			1
they have historically been tolerated by the authorities , sometimes with corrupt police overlooking their violence , and are routinely glamorised in fanzines and manga @entity86 , membership at an all - time low			0
a screen grab from the @entity8 and @entity9 the @entity11 website set up by yakuza gangsters a video which features a corporate song includes shakily - shot footage of members making a pilgrimage to a shrine members of the @entity12 which is not illegal and even have their own headquarters periodic crackdowns have gained momentum and there is evidence the mob 's appeal is waning.the number of people belonging to yakuza groups fell to an all - time low in 2013 , slipping below the 60,000 - member mark for the first time on record , police said last month			1
an increasingly poor public image and @entity2 's economy have made the lives of the gangsters difficult which has made membership less attractive for potential recruits , experts said			2
the website , which looks outdated , is an attempt to counter the yakuza 's image as ' anti-social forces ' by showing how neighbourly its members are , experts say			1
one page shows men collecting litter along the banks of the @entity131 near the @entity12 's headquarters in @entity53 , western @entity2 , with a nearby sign reading : ' @entity124			2
' @entity134 ( centre ) , the boss of @entity2 's largest ' yakuza ' gang , the @entity12 , in 2011 @entity138 , a journalist and author who has written extensively on organised crime in @entity2 , said the @entity12 's online offering was an effort to prove its humanitarian credentials			2
' by presenting an anti-drugs theme , it shows concern for social welfare , it shows pictures of the group doing emergency relief after the ( 2011 ) and @entity53 earthquakes , ' he told @entity152			0
he said it was true that the yakuza made use of their ' ties to the trucking industry and their abundance of cash , lack of red tape and institutional memory ' to provide help after the disasters			0
but , he added , ' there was a certain amount of self - interest involved - getting in with the locals helps them get a share of the reconstruction money			2
' @entity138 , whose account of his life working the crime beat for a @entity2 newspaper is being made into a film starring @entity179 actor @entity178 , said the site was an attempt to whitewash an unsavoury truth			0
' the yakuza motto is " help the weak and fight the strong			0
" in practice , it 's usually the reverse , ' he said			0
police officials said they could not immediately confirm the website was made by the @entity12 , nor comment on it			0
the website , which comes complete with a ' contact us ' button , can be found at @entity193			0
