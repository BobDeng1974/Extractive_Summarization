like many super-organised ladies with an eye for a bargain , @entity0 has already bought all her gift - wrap and cards for the coming @entity6 in the january sales			1
‘ i ’ve always done it			2
it ’s cheaper and this way you spread the cost throughout the year , ’ she says			2
old habits die hard , it seems — even when you ’ve got a couple of million in the bank			1
after all , as @entity0 , 61 , points out : ‘ why spend more money than you need to ? ’ it ’s a slogan she ’s likely to take to her grave , along with her equally thrifty friends , despite their astonishing good fortune : ten years ago , @entity0 and ten of her colleagues at the @entity28 store where they worked in the @entity30 town of @entity31 discovered they had won £ 18 million on the @entity32			1
valued : back row , @entity0 , @entity33 and @entity34			2
front row , @entity36 and @entity37 seven women and two men in the syndicate each pocketed £ 1.4 million while two members , who had double shares in the group ’s 13 entry lines , won £ 2.8 million			1
it ’s a serious amount of money by anyone ’s standards , but particularly for a group who happily describe themselves as working class — checkout assistants who had spent their lives saving to pay for modest holidays and a second - hand car , or who would , in the words of @entity34 , 65 , ‘ panic ’ if the washing machine broke down , because it meant blowing a hole in the tight monthly budget			1
all of them , then , could be forgiven for going a bit overboard with their new found wealth : @entity67 style mansions , a modest yacht , a @entity69 — all were within grasp in this reasonably priced part of the country			2
but then this is @entity30 , where they do n’t have much truck with showiness — although @entity34 ’s husband @entity78 did ‘ splash out ’ on a second - hand mondeo			1
they have n’t even engaged in the sort of bickering that often characterises syndicate relations once the fuss has died down			2
a decade after their win , a sizeable number of the gang meet for lunch at least once a month			1
‘ we do n’t talk about money , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ we do n’t need to			2
families , homes , holidays — that ’s what we chat about			2
’ ringleader : @entity0 ( pictured ) and her husband @entity98 , 70 , received £ 4.3 million when they won certainly , when i meet with five of them at a pub in @entity31 there is nothing to betray their wealth			1
except the suspiciously bronzed decolletage of @entity33 , 64 , who has just returned from a month - long @entity109 cruise with her husband @entity110 , 68 , a former factory foreman			1
but that ’s about as flashy as it gets			2
while @entity32 history is littered with fortunes squandered , here in @entity30 sound good sense and knowing the value of a pound is the order of the day			1
‘ it ’s in your background i think , ’ says @entity34			2
‘ my mum and dad scrimped and saved for everything they had and i think it makes you value things more			2
’ ten years ago , on a £ 5.67 hourly wage on the @entity28 checkout , there was no cash to splash			1
little wonder the lottery was a tempting prospect , and it was @entity0 who kicked off proceedings			2
she had already worked at the store for nine years when , in 1995 , it got a @entity32 terminal and she decided to play			1
enlisting her friends to form a syndicate , @entity0 insisted on a couple of rules : you paid a pound a line , if you did n’t pay you did n’t get your share if they won , and the numbers could never be changed			1
‘ we had 13 of us paying in at a pound a line — when a member dropped out someone else would pick up their line			0
’ it ’s in this way that she got two shares , with her husband @entity98 , 70 , picking up a share , too ( giving the couple £ 4.2 million when they won )			1
before the big scoop , modest winnings were spent on ‘ checkout ’ nights out : ‘ alcohol			0
lots of , ’ cackles @entity34			0
a £ 1,000 prize from five numbers one year left them all wondering if that was the only windfall they would ever have			1
that is , until the evening of monday july 26 , 2005 , when @entity34 — who had recently been given a pay rise to £ 200 a week — returned from a weekend away in the family caravan and casually checked the group ’s numbers			1
‘ and there they were , ’ she recalls			0
‘ i said to @entity78 : “ i think we ’ve won			2
” i knew @entity0 had an early shift the next day and did n’t want to wake her up so i decided to ring her first thing and went straight to bed			0
’ modest : @entity33 ( right ) and her husband bought a three - bedroom detached house and she had her eyes lasered			1
while @entity36 ' ( left ) only serious spending was paying off her mortgage astonishingly , she slept like a baby			2
‘ i suppose i was numb really			0
it had n’t properly registered			0
but my husband was up all night flicking between @entity194 and the numbers and back again			2
’ when she did ring @entity0 , at 6.30 the following morning , her friend did n’t believe it either			0
‘ all i could think about was i had to get into work as there was only me and one other lady getting the tills ready for opening , ’ says @entity0			0
off she went , popping the winning ticket into her bra for safekeeping			0
@entity36 , at 26 the youngest winner , was similarly shocked			0
she had moved to work in a different @entity28 branch three years before , but carried on paying in			1
treats : @entity37 ( left ) only bought her designer handbag six years after her win while @entity34 ( right ) and her husband @entity78 ' splashed out ' on a second - hand @entity211 after the win ‘ after i ’d got the call i remember ringing my dad and he kept saying : “ you did pay in did n’t you ? ” it puts doubt in your mind			1
i was resisting getting worked up until i could know for sure , ’ she says			0
all the ladies worked a shift that day			0
in those early weeks most of them barely spent a penny — not even @entity0 and @entity98 with their £ 4.2 million windfall			2
‘ i used to draw my husband £ 40 out the cashpoint every week for petrol and spends , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ after we won he still wanted £ 40 , saying he did n’t need any more			1
‘ a few weeks later i even got a call from my bank saying : “ it ’s your money , mrs @entity0 , you can spend it you know			1
” and i told them there was nothing that i wanted			0
’ she even admits to missing work			0
‘ not the early starts — i sometimes used to get up at 4.30am — but i missed the people			0
’ eventually , the @entity243 bought a house — upgrading from their semi to a £ 350,000 four - bedroom bungalow — and a couple of new cars			1
they also paid for a ‘ fancy bash ’ for their daughter ’s wedding the following year			0
the other members were similarly measured			0
‘ my husband got a @entity255 , we bought a three - bedroom detached house and i got my eyes lasered — i ’d always said that if i had any money i ’d get them done , so i did , ’ says @entity33			1
there is , though , the cruising			0
‘ after our first cruise we never looked back			0
now we go four times a year			0
we ’ve seen the world , which we never ever thought we ’d do			0
’ even by the ladies modest standards though , the @entity267 , who have been married for 47 years and have three grown up children , took caution to the extreme			2
‘ @entity78 would happily have sat on it for five years , ’ says his wife			2
‘ i did have to point out that he was in his 60s , i was n’t far off and that we might as well get on with it			0
’ they bought a bungalow and upgraded their caravan			0
so diamonds and designer handbags came there none — the rather smart @entity285 i spy on the arm of @entity37 , 54 , only materialised six years after her win on the insistence of her 24 - year - old daughter , who said she should treat herself to mark her 50th birthday			1
happy : top row , @entity36 , @entity33 and @entity34			0
@entity294 row , @entity0 and @entity37 her only diamonds , meanwhile , have come in the form of a @entity298 tile cutter that @entity299 bought her for a birthday recently			0
‘ i did ask for something with diamonds in it and apparently there ’s a diamond in the trimmer			0
i still did n’t speak to him for a bit though , ’ she says			0
even @entity36 , the youngster of the group , was a model of probity : in the months after pocketing £ 2.8 million her only serious spending was paying off her £ 70,000 mortgage			1
she also carried on her work at the @entity28 checkout and only left following comments that she was taking work from someone who might need the money			1
she admits she struggled to know what to do with herself when she stopped working			0
so she flew to @entity321 and spent a year volunteering in schools			0
she met @entity323 , 41 , a painter and decorator , on her return , and the couple married five years ago			1
as a single lady in possession of a @entity32 fortune , how could she know his intentions were honourable ? ‘ of course , you wonder what people are thinking when they meet you			1
it helped that i knew him through friends			0
ultimately you just have to trust your instincts			0
’ these days the money helps her be a stay - at - home mum to their three children while @entity323 goes out to work			1
time for the million - pound question : can money buy happiness ? it comes as no surprise that they all resolutely shake their heads			1
‘ i lost @entity350 two years ago and i would give it all away in a heartbeat if it meant having him back , ’ says @entity33			1
’ @entity0 adds : ‘ we were happy before all this			0
it ’s about the people you ’re surrounded by — children , grandchildren			0

ten years ago 11 colleagues at @entity28 in @entity30 won £ *18m* on @entity32
nine of them each pocketed £ *1.4million* while two others won £ *2.8million*
but they all live modestly and there is little to betray the money in the bank
one woman ' splashed out ' on a second - hand @entity211 after the win
another *'s* husband continued to need just £ 40 - a - week in spending money
