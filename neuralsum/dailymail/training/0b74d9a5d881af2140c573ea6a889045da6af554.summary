by @entity0 last updated at 12:33 am on 28th february 2012 probe : @entity1 is likely to be interviewed as a witness amid claims she was passed details of the original @entity6 phone hacking inquiry @entity9 tipped off @entity1 as early as 2006 about the full extent of phone - hacking at the @entity6 , the @entity8 inquiry has heard			1
police told mrs @entity1 , then editor of @entity15 , they were confident that private detective @entity16 and the sunday newspaper ’s royal editor @entity17 were ‘ bang to rights ’			1
detectives had established that @entity16 – working solely for the @entity6 – had hacked more than 100 victims ’ phones and had been paid more than £ 1million by @entity23			1
the revelations were contained in an internal @entity6 email read out at the @entity8 inquiry yesterday			0
the revelation came hot on the heels of @entity23 's launch of the @entity15 on sunday , to replace the @entity30 which was shut down amid a public outcry			1
the damning email undermines @entity23 ’s claims – which they were still clinging to until 2010 – that phone - hacking was not a widespread problem at the paper but the work of @entity16 and @entity17 alone			1
it also exposed the cosy relationship between the @entity40 and @entity42 ’s @entity41			0
the email , headed ‘ strictly private and confidential ’ , was sent on september 15 , 2006 , by @entity44 , the @entity46 ’s legal manger , to the paper ’s then editor @entity47			2
this was after @entity16 and @entity17 had been arrested , but before their conviction			1
mr @entity44 wrote : ‘ here is what @entity1 told me about info relayed to her by the cops			0
‘ they suggested that they were not widening the case to include other @entity46 people , but would do so if they got direct evidence , say @entity46 journos directly accessing the voicemails ( this is what did for @entity17 )			2
’ the email also noted : ‘ the only payment records they found were from @entity23 , ie the @entity46 retainer and other invoices , they said that over the period they looked at ( going way back ) there seemed to be over £ 1million of payments			0
’ mr @entity44 ’s message concluded : ‘ they ’re going to contact @entity77 ( @entity1 , mrs @entity1 ’s maiden name ) today to see if she wishes to take it further			0
’ @entity17 and @entity16 were arrested on august 8 , 2006			1

the unnamed officer , who was involved in the first 2006 phone - hacking probe , has not been suspended while the allegations are investigated			1
@entity9 have been criticised for failing to discover evidence that hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter in the original investigation led by @entity96			1
yesterday it was revealed for the first time that the @entity30 's publisher has admitted four journalists on the paper personally hacked phones - and that the practice was still going on as recently as 2009			1
the reporters , who have not been named , were apparently shown how to intercept voicemails by private detective @entity16 , the @entity104 reported			1

the revelations are contained in admissions made by publishers @entity23 in court papers prepared for a @entity120 phone hacking trial			2
the case will not go ahead as all the people claiming damages have reached out of court settlements			0
as the hacking scandal engulfed the @entity30 last year , @entity1 was forced to quit her post as @entity23 chief - executive			1

it was then that the police officer allegedly provided her with details of the investigation			2
the officer works in the @entity40 's specialist operations division which handles protection for the most senior public figures and deals with counter-terrorism operations			2
there is no suggestion they were paid for providing details of the investigation			0
although the @entity23 executive who was passed details of the original investigation has not been named , the @entity84 reported that it is understood to be ms @entity1			0
a spokesman for @entity1 yesterday refused to comment			0
a spokesman for the @entity84 confirmed that they were probing the claims			0
' the @entity84 is independently investigating an allegation of inappropriate disclosure of information by a serving metropolitan police officer during the original phone hacking investigation in 2006 , ' he said			1
' however , as the @entity84 has made clear , there is no evidence to suggest that any inappropriate payment of any sort was made to this officer			1
' after careful consideration of the circumstances in this case it has been decided that suspending this officer , who is based within specialist operations , or restricting his duties would not be appropriate			2
this will obviously be kept under review			0
