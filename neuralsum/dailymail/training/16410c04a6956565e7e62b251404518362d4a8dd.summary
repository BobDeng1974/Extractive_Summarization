so , @entity0 or @entity1 ? that is the question that will be dominating those casting their eyes towards @entity6 for sunday 's @entity7			1
@entity0 is agonisingly close to clinching the title , though @entity1 is lurking behind the @entity9			1
but who do the big names think will win it and why ? @entity13 gather their thoughts ... @entity0 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) go head to head on sunday in the @entity18 @entity19 @entity0 will almost certainly win the championship			1
however , there is a chance @entity23 or @entity24 could finish second in the race			0
if that was to happen and @entity1 wins , that would put @entity0 in third and he would lose the title			1
any mechanical failure would have an enormous effect , too			0
@entity0 is agonisingly close to winning the title but mechanical failures can have a big effect @entity34 i think @entity0 will win the championship			2
he should n’t have anything to worry about if he ’s prepared , as he is better than @entity1			2
@entity0 only needs to keep cool to clinch the title over @entity40 team - mate and rival @entity1 @entity41 i hope it ’s @entity0 but the way the script is written it could be @entity1			1
talk of a new contract could be a distraction for @entity0 , and the double points system makes things so different			0
we all want @entity0 but i think there will be a final twist in the tail ... @entity41 says he wants @entity0 to win the title but that there could be a final twist in the tail @entity58 @entity0 should win the championship			2
i ’m pretty sure he ’ll want to take it with a big win to underline his talent and achievement , even though he only has to coast to second in a dominant car			0
@entity1 ’s win in @entity68 , however , ensures that with significant contact or mechanical issues for @entity0 , the double points handout would clinch the title for him			1
@entity0 goes into sunday 's @entity18 looking to seal the title over @entity1 @entity73 obviously i want @entity0 to win but it should be an amazing last race			1
it reminds me of 1989 when @entity77 played @entity78 in that title decider			0
as for double points , i think a lot of managers at the bottom of the league would like that at the end of the season ! the pressure ’s on @entity0 but hopefully he ’ll do it			0
@entity90 's @entity73 believes it will be an amazing final race and hopes @entity0 can clinch the title @entity93 @entity0 is the favourite because he has more wins and points			2
the only way it could go wrong is a reliability gremlin or if the pair get silly on the track like in @entity102 and @entity103			0
@entity1 has called for a clean , fair race and i hope he gets it			0
@entity106 , the head of @entity40 , has told @entity0 and @entity1 that they can simply go all out and race @entity109 ( @entity110 ) @entity1 is a very talented racer but @entity0 , despite three dnfs and two starts from the back , has secured 10 wins this season — double @entity1 ’s tally — and has been on the podium for every race he has finished .			1

@entity0 and @entity1 go head to head on sunday
