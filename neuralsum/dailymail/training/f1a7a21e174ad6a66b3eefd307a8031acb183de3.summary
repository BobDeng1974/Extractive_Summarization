a second senior judge can be revealed today as a campaigner for the rights of members of a vile paedophile group that tried to legalise sex with children			1
@entity7 , the chief coroner for @entity8 and @entity9 , publicly declared that his campaign group ‘ supported the civil liberties of everyone including paedophiles ’			1
a mail on sunday investigation has discovered that he openly criticised the prosecution of the infamous @entity17 , even after its leader was jailed at the @entity19			1
defence : @entity7 , the chief coroner for @entity8 and @entity9 , publicly declared that his campaign group ' supported the civil liberties of everyone including paedophiles ' and he wrote that he backed a ‘ reduction in the age of consent for both homosexuals and heterosexuals to 14 ’ when he ran a high - profile civil liberties organisation			1
documents uncovered by this newspaper show that mr @entity7 , then a barrister , also defended one of the vile child sex campaigners in court			1
the news follows our revelations last week that an @entity36 judge @entity35 was a founder of a support group for @entity17 members ahead of their prosecution			1
and today it can be revealed that @entity35 also represented a @entity17 leader at the @entity19 more than ten years after his initial involvement in the campaign			1
while a barrister , @entity7 ( pictured ) represented @entity17 's @entity45 at his trial			1
he said he had a professional obligation to accept any brief the new details will put further pressure on @entity52 grandees @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , who were all leading figures in the @entity57 when @entity7 was its chairman			1
they have insisted the paedophiles who joined the group had been marginalised by the late 1970s , but mr @entity7 was still defending their rights in @entity57 ’s newsletters as late as 1983			1
last night the former @entity19 judge , 67 , said he did not recall supporting a lower age of consent or representing a @entity17 leader , and expressed regret that paedophile activists were linked to the @entity57 for so long			1
there are growing calls for a full investigation into the influence of @entity17 , which openly campaigned for the age of consent to be lowered to just four , and which received invaluable help from some on the @entity75			1
@entity77 , of the @entity76 , said : ‘ shame on the @entity57 for ever going down this route			0
everybody has always known that paedophiles want to harm children			0
‘ this strengthens our call for a @entity85 into this whole murky affair – there are clearly many @entity89 figures involved			0
’ documents uncovered by @entity91 reveal for the first time the role played by mr @entity7 in defending @entity17			1
he attacked the prosecution months after @entity17 was described in court as a ‘ force for evil ’ , and its chairman @entity98 was jailed for two years for the rare offence of conspiracy to corrupt public morals			1
mr @entity7 wrote that the case was an ‘ expensive and largely unsuccessful ’ attempt to revive the ancient law , ‘ dangerous not only for the defendant at risk of a prison sentence but also for the prosecutor at risk of exposure for vindictiveness ’			1
in a lengthy article published in the @entity57 ’s newsletter , rights , in november 1981 , he claimed that although @entity17 members ‘ had been sending pretty unattractive porn to each other ’ , police could not nail the organisers for what they wrongly believed to be an ‘ introduction to sex with children racket ’			2
corrupted debate : @entity125 and @entity126 , pictured , were both prominent members of the @entity17 to be jailed			2
@entity126 was represented in court by @entity129 , now a high court judge , who also said he would have been obligated to take the case a retrial meant ‘ more expense ’ and ‘ more worry for those in the dock ’ and after only one defendant , @entity98 , was convicted , mr @entity7 claimed this was ‘ hardly a justification ’ for launching the case			1
the @entity17 members were accused of trying to arrange sex with children through contact adverts , but mr @entity7 said their defence was that they were ‘ lonely , isolated paedophiles getting in touch with others similarly cut - off from society by their emotional and sexual orientation ’			1
he concluded the charge against @entity17 had been ‘ vague , wordy , above all too remote from any tangible misdemeanour ’			2
mr @entity7 added , however , that ‘ child molesters and other sexual offenders should unquestionably be brought to account for specific offences under our extensive protective legislation ’			2
this prompted a self - confessed paedophile to write to the magazine complaining that @entity7 had not done enough to defend his rights			2
mr @entity7 wrote back in the spring 1983 issue to apologise for offending the paedophile and to insist that the @entity57 – now known as @entity57 – did have a radical stance on sexual law			1
he wrote : ‘ our policy … is to seek a reduction in the age of consent for both homosexuals and heterosexuals to 14			0
my remarks were not intended to infringe upon these proposals ; nor were they intended to offend , and if they did i regret it			0
civil rights : allegations that paedophiles took advantage of the @entity57 ' permissive nature gained traction because @entity54 ( centre ) and @entity53 ( right ) were senior figures ‘ i am happy to reaffirm that within the existing policy , @entity57 supports the civil liberties of everybody including paedophiles and gays			1
’ in 1984 , the year after he left the @entity57 , mr @entity7 went on to act as counsel for @entity17 member @entity45 – who under the alias @entity190 had attended gay rights meetings with judge @entity35 – at his @entity19 trial			1
according to press cuttings , mr @entity7 ‘ told the jury that neither @entity17 nor its views were on trial ’			1
mr @entity7 , married with two children , went on to become a @entity200 and served as a circuit judge before being appointed the first chief coroner in @entity8 and @entity9 in 2012			1
in a statement to @entity91 , he pointed out he had ‘ expressed the clear view , which i hold today , that paedophiles and sex offenders should be caught and punished ’			0
@entity54 , pictured left in 1982 , strenuously denied ever endorsing @entity17 leader @entity208 ( right ) regarding his apologetic letter to the paedophile , mr @entity7 said : ‘ i responded with a reference to what was then @entity57 policy about the age of consent which was proposed as 14 for males and females			1
‘ i do not recall personally supporting that policy : my particular interests were policing , prisons and the administration of justice			0
‘ for the avoidance of all doubt , my view is that the current age of consent is correct			0
’ he added : ‘ i am sorry the @entity17 had any connection with @entity57			2
i was chairman of @entity57 when i believe @entity17 was ejected from @entity57 , which was the right decision			1
‘ with hindsight it should have happened earlier			0
i never supported @entity17 or its aims in any way			2
abuse of children , physical or sexual , is and always has been a terrible crime			0
’ @entity236 , an academic and campaigner against abuse in musical education , said last night : ‘ this is an extremely serious situation which demonstrates that the @entity17 network was able to infiltrate some of the upper echelons of @entity244 government and society in the 1970s and 1980s			2
this needs to be thoroughly investigated with proper resources and funding			0
’ additional reporting : @entity250 and @entity251 defence : @entity129 , now @entity35 @entity253 : @entity254 , 1984 @entity7 represented senior @entity17 figure @entity45 at his 1984 @entity19 trial			1
@entity45 was found guilty of sending obscene material in the post and jailed for six months			0
he was cleared of incitement to commit sexual offences with children			0
fellow @entity17 man @entity125 was also jailed			2
mr @entity7 said yesterday : ‘ i do not recall details about the trial of anyone called @entity45			2
' every client i represented would have been because of the professional obligation to accept any brief in a court in which i practised			0
’ case two : @entity271 , 1991 @entity129 was the barrister for @entity17 ’s last chairman , @entity126 , in 1991			2
the former @entity274 security guard should have stood trial with @entity45 but fled to @entity276 and was only deported years later			0
@entity126 finally appeared at the @entity19 in december 1991 where he admitted publishing an obscene magazine and sending it through the post , receiving an 18 - month sentence			0
last night a spokesman for @entity35 said : ‘ he does not recall this case but he is in absolutely no doubt that he would only have taken it under the “ cab rank ” rule because he was asked to			0
he would not have volunteered to take it			0
’ the top judge exposed as a campaigner for a vile paedophile group is now under official investigation for misconduct			0
lord @entity35 was revealed by @entity91 last week to have been a founder of a ‘ defence committee ’ for the @entity17 while it was openly calling for the age of consent to be cut to just four			1
he discussed holding courtroom protests at meetings with @entity17 chairman @entity98 – who was jailed for two years in 1981 for conspiracy to corrupt public morals – and wrote articles claiming @entity98 ’s trial was an ‘ act of oppression ’ because the child sex campaigners only wanted to ‘ make friends ’			2
exposed : how @entity91 covered the story of @entity306 last week following our story , horrified members of the public made a string of complaints about the senior judge and the official watchdog for the judiciary has agreed to launch an investigation into his conduct			2
@entity35 , who was last year appointed to the @entity319 – an elite circle of advisers to the @entity322 – has offered not to sit on any criminal cases at the @entity324 until the investigation is completed			0
if the @entity326 finds he should have declared his involvement with the paedophile groups , or that his support for them brought him into disrepute , he could face disciplinary action from justice secretary @entity333 and lord chief justice lord @entity334			2
details of the exact allegations made against @entity35 are not being made public			0
a spokesman for the watchdog said : ‘ the @entity326 has received a number of complaints in relation to @entity306			0
the @entity326 has started an investigation in accordance with the @entity326 ( @entity344 and other office holders ) rules 2013			0
‘ @entity306 has voluntarily refrained from sitting in criminal cases pending the outcome of the investigation			0
’ lord @entity35 , 61 , said : ‘ i positively welcome that this will be the subject of a detailed and independent investigation			0
’ a senior @entity200 said : ‘ @entity35 ’s stepping down from criminal appeals is unprecedented			0
he was appointed for his criminal expertise and he really has no other specialisation			0

@entity7 publicly declared support for paedophiles ' ' civil liberties '
he criticised decision to prosecute @entity17 leader @entity208 under old law
