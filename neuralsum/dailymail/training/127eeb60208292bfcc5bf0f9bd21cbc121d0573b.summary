by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 12:42 est , 12 december 2012 a blistering review of @entity4 's new @entity3 restaurant is having a surprising effect - transforming the chef 's ailing venture into the hippest spot for ' ironic dining ' among @entity10 locals			1
@entity4 ’s @entity11 , a massive 500 - seat venue in @entity3 , has been doing a busy trade , according to reports			1
last month @entity16 food critic @entity15 slated the restaurant with a harsh review which asked : ' why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish ? ' and deemed a margarita a ' combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde '			2
locals have been venturing into the touristy , midtown hub to eat at @entity4 's place on west 44th street , checking themselves in on @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 while uploading pictures of food and cocktails to @entity45			1
@entity46 , 24 , who works in advertising sales and lives on the @entity48 , went a week after the @entity16 review ran with two friends who also live in @entity10			0
miss @entity51 told @entity52 she went to the restaurant mid-week for lunch and described it as ' busy but not packed '			0
she said although there were tourists , other people appeared to have gone to sample the food following the review with ' lots of pictures being taken '			0
edible : one diner , who lives in the @entity10 , said while some of the food was passable other menu items were ' weird ' delicacies : a platter of oysters at the @entity3 restaurant which opened in september the group shared appetizers of fries , mozzarella sticks , tacos and wings			1
miss @entity51 told @entity52 that the fries were the ' weirdest ' as they were covered in hot sauce , had no potato in them and were just the shell			0
the mozzarella sticks were ' fine ' while the tacos and wings were ' nothing special but edible '			0
she added : ' it 's a lot of fried food and hot sauce			0
i did n't feel too good after leaving			0
' @entity4 is a one - man brand of books , merchandise and tv shows who also co-owns five restaurants in @entity95			1
unknown until 2006 when he won the second season of @entity97 , mr @entity4 now ranks as the 10th highest paid chef in the country , according to @entity100			2
however his first solo venture in @entity10 , which opened in september , has been such a flop that one @entity104 reviewer said : ' if @entity106 and i die of food poisoning you ’ll know that these did us in , ' referring to the @entity111			2
the @entity10 in - crowd : tv host @entity113 enjoys a @entity114 at @entity4 's with a friend in the @entity16 , mr @entity15 questioned whether mr @entity4 , 44 , deserves his chef credentials and widespread praise from cable network fans			1
he asks in a roll - out of blistering questions : ' when you hung that sign by the entrance that says , welcome to flavor town ! , were you just messing with our heads ? ' why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish ? ' what exactly about a small salad with four or five miniature croutons makes @entity4 ’s @entity131 ( a ) big ( b ) famous or ( c ) @entity4 ’s , in any meaningful sense			1
' and finally : ' hey , did you try that blue drink , the one that glows like nuclear waste ? the watermelon margarita ? any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde ? ' heading over to @entity4 's place : packed tables at @entity4 's @entity3 restaurant - his first solo venture the scathing review attracted so much attention that @entity4 appeared on the @entity150 to defend himself			1
he said : ' to me it 's impossible to come in and have a dining experience and have every single thing wrong , unless you come in with a different agenda and you want to sensationalize something and you want to blow it out of the water			0
' @entity4 added that the food critic had gone ' overboard ' to raise his own profile but did admit that his restaurant needed some fine tuning .			2
