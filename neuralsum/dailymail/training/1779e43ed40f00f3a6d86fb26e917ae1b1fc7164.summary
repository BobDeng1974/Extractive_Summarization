with the second squirrel tucked inside a small wooden box marked ' the @entity13 ' , our hero laid his tiny hands on a saw that had been carefully placed on the lid , leaving the pair inadvertently recreating a scene familiar to magic lovers around the world			2
@entity21 , 51 , took the photograph in his garden in @entity24 , @entity25 , after spending several days setting up the scene to entertain his 11 - year - old son @entity26			1

mr @entity21 said the squirrels spent only a few minutes exploring the box trick : @entity21 took the photograph in his garden in @entity24 , @entity25 , after spending several days setting up the scene to entertain his 11 - year - old son @entity26 mr @entity21 said he came up with idea for a squirrel magic show after watching professional magicians with @entity39 on @entity40 in december			1
he said : ' my son is very keen on magic so i thought it might be fun to see if i could get the squirrels to perform a classic trick			2
' ' it did take quite a while to set up as i wanted it to look realistic			0
i thought the great @entity13 was a nice stage name			0
' mr @entity21 said the squirrels spent only a few minutes exploring the box , making the task of getting the perfect photograph much more difficult than it looks			1
talent : mr @entity21 said he came up with idea for a squirrel magic show after watching professional magicians with @entity39 on @entity40 in december patience : mr @entity21 spend several days waiting for the squirrels to arrive and explore his box he also said the squirrels were continually jumping around and chasing each other , leaving them both in exactly the right spot at exactly the right time for only a fraction of a second			1
he said : ' it took even longer for them to get into the position i wanted as they are obviously wild animals - they needed a few takes			0
' ' in the end i was trying for two or three days but it was worth the wait ... i got the shot i wanted for my son , ' he added			0
after spending several days trying to capture the perfect shot , finally doing so proved something of a relief for mr @entity21 - not least because a heavy rainstorm hours later reduced the box to small pieces .			1

@entity21 , 51 , spent several days setting up the scene in his @entity25 garden
the keen photographer wanted to create a squirrel magic show for his son
the squirrels explored the box for only a few moments and kept *fidgeting*
but eventually mr @entity21 captured the photograph he *'d* spent days waiting for
