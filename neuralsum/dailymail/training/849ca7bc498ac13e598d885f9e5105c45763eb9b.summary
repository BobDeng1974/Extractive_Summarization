when @entity1 broke up with her long term boyfriend , she chalked her tiredness and headaches down to being heartbroken and exhausted			1
but after collapsing on a day trip to @entity6 , she was rushed to hospital where doctors said she had suffered an unexplained seizure			1
she got the train back home to @entity12 , @entity13 , to recuperate , but after that point , her memory goes blank			2
it emerged she was suffering from autoimmune encephalitis , a rare but potentially deadly illness which begins as flu - like symptoms but causes the brain to swell			1
but she actually had autoimmune encephalitis , a rare disease which caused her to have seizures as her brain was swelling miss @entity1 went to see a friend in @entity6 to take her mind off the break up			1
however she collapsed and was rushed to hospital , where doctors said she had suffered an unexplained seizure she had suffered eight more seizures and was eventually being put into an induced coma for six weeks			1
when she woke up in january 2014 she had missed @entity36 , and had to begin chemotherapy treatment to stop her body attacking cells in her brain			1
when she was in a coma she had also developed gangrene in her bowel as a clot had formed and stopped the blood from reaching the area			1
she had been rushed for emergency surgery on december 23rd to have a foot of her bowel removed , and had a colostomy bag fitted			1
but the 27 - year - old is now on the road to recovery , with the help of her family and her nine - year - old daughter , @entity55			1
miss @entity1 recalls how quickly and unexpectedly the illness came on last year			1
' i 'd been with my ex for around 11 months , ' she told @entity59			0
' i was upset , although knew it was for the best when it ended			0
'' but the break up had taken it out of me and i 'd been exhausted			2
' i just felt a bit ill. i 'd felt run down and suffered headaches			2
' so she organised a trip to @entity6 in november 2013 to perk her up and keep her mind off the break - up			2
' i was planning to see my friend @entity70 , ' she said			0
' @entity55 was staying with my parents			1
' he picked me up from the station and we went to his house			0
he popped opened a bottle of champagne , started to pour it			2
doctors put miss @entity1 into an induced coma for six weeks while they treated her for autoimmune encephalitis			1
during this time , her bowel became gangrenous due to a blood clot and she had part of it removed			2
she is pictured after waking up from the coma , and soon had a colostomy bag fitted although the initial shock passed , for a number of weeks she was still too frail to see her daughter @entity55 , who stayed with her parents			1
she says the moment she saw her daughter again was ' brilliant ' autoimmune encephalitis is a serious medical condition in which the immune system attacks the brain , impairing function			1
it caused by a problem with the immune system ( the body 's natural defence against infection )			0
the immune system mistakes healthy tissue in the brain as a threat and attacks it , causing the brain to become inflamed and swell			1
the body produces antibodies which attack the @entity115 receptors in the brain , which are proteins that cause electrical impulses			2
their functioning is necessary for judgement , perception of reality , human interaction , memory , and the control of unconscious activities such as breathing and swallowing			0
it 's not always clear why the immune system malfunctions in this way			0
some cases of autoimmune encephalitis are caused by the immune system reacting to the presence of a tumour ( an abnormal growth ) inside the body			2
the main symptoms are flu like , but people also develop memory loss , difficulty sleeping , and may become unable to communicate or speak coherently			0
they might become confused , have hallucinations or exhibit strange behaviour			0
other symptoms include seizures , loss of consciousness and movement disorders			2
source : the @entity152 ' but i said no. and i never turned down bubbles			0
' i remember i really did n't feel well			0
' hours later she collapsed and was taken by ambulance to hospital where doctors said it was an unexplained seizure			2
she continued : ' doctors told me they had done tests and could n't find anything wrong			2
' she returned to her parents ' house in @entity13 , but that week suffered seven more seizures , ending up in hospital			1
' i started behaving very aggressively and shouting at people , ' she said			0
' i was put in an induced coma			1
' she developed a blood clot in her bowel which blocked the blood from getting to the area , leading to gangrene – where the tissue rots and dies			2
while still in a coma , she had to have emergency surgery to remove the gangrenous part of the bowel , while her family stood by , hoping for the best			1
she woke up confused , with a tube in her nose , having no memory of the seizures			0
' i did n't remember coming home from @entity6 , i did n't remember that week , i did n't remember the seizures			0
' i did n't understand why i had a tube up my nose			0
' although the initial shock passed , for a number of weeks she was still too frail to see her daughter , who stayed with her parents			2
doctors said miss @entity1 had suffered from autoimmune encephalitis , also known as @entity197 receptor encephalitis			1
this is a serious medical condition in which the immune system attacks @entity201 receptors , which are proteins that control electrical impulses in the brain			0
they are necessary for judgement , perception of reality , interaction , memory and also control unconscious activities like breathing and swallowing , which is why this type of encephalitis is so serious			0
miss @entity1 was treated with chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide to kill the antibodies - immune cells – that were attacking cells in her brain			1
miss @entity1 was treated with chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide to kill the antibodies - immune cells – that were attacking cells in her brain			1
she is pictured here before being hospitalised with encephalitis she said : ' i had chemotherapy every month to battle the infection which had caused my brain to swell			1
' my hair started to thin , although i did n't lose it entirely and i was too weak to eat , was fed through a tube and lost three stone			0
' finally , she was discharged from hospital and moved back in with her parents to further aid her recovery			1
' at the beginning of march – four months after i collapsed – i was discharged and went to stay with mum and dad , ' she said			0
' seeing @entity55 again was brilliant			2
' i started building up weight and went back for chemo appointments every month until june , but then doctors said i could stop , although they see me as an outpatient			1
she has to take anti-seizure and steroid medication to stop the swelling in her brain , which she says make her ' tired and emotional ' and prone to be completely knocked out by illnesses like a cold			0
miss @entity1 is now on the road to recovery thanks to the help of her family and daughter @entity55			1
though the medication she now takes leaves her ' tired and emotional ' , she hopes to go back to work as a financial advisor once her colostomy bag is removed ' my neurologist has said in three years i could be medication - free , ' she said , ' so fingers crossed			1
' adjusting to life with a colostomy bag has also been difficult , leaving her tired and in pain			1
' it can get you down , it 's really painful and it can stop you doing lots of things			0
' there are people who have got them for life and they just get on with it			0
' ' but i 'm lucky mine is reversible – it gives me hope that it will be removed soon			0
' in a few months she will have a procedure sin which they will remove the colostomy bag and stitch up her bowel so it can function normally			1
once the bag is removed , she hopes to go back to work as a financial advisor			1
' it 's horrible not working , because i 've worked since i was 16 , ' she said			0
' it 's what i 've always done			0
moving back in with my mum and dad , that was a big change too			0
' ' they are so brilliant , i ca n't complain			0
' she is also proud at how well her daughter has coped with the terrifying ordeal of her mother being hospitalised and in a coma			2
she said : ' she seems to just get on with it			0
if i 'm unwell she makes me a get well card , if i 'm tired she just leaves me to it			0
' she took my story in a magazine to show her friends at school , she 's dead proud of me			0
