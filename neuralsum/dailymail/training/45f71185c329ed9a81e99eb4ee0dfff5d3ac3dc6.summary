freed : @entity5 ( left ) was released from @entity14			1

he was found bleeding to death in a stairwell near his home in @entity28 , south @entity29			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ if i had my way the two brothers would have been hung for what they did to @entity33			2
‘ these are boys who premeditatedly attacked and killed a defenceless ten - year - old boy , and to serve just four or five years is ridiculous			1

heartache : @entity5 's father @entity40 , with his late wife @entity41 , who died in 2008			1
mr @entity6 today said in an interview he believed his son 's killers ' should have been hanged ' @entity5 ( left ) and his brother @entity10 ( right ) when they were on trial over @entity5 's murder mr @entity6 said : ‘ if they had used prison to reform themselves instead of just getting bigger in the gym , if they had apologised to me and my family instead of bragging about how tough they are , i would have embraced them			1
' i would have hugged my son ’s killers			2
if they had shown proper remorse , that would have warranted me to forgive them , to talk to them about turning their lives round , and it would have freed me to move on , too			0
this was a big opportunity missed			0
i am not blaming the prison system because some people come out reformed , but these brothers have never apologised			2
‘ so my bitterness is not only that @entity33 died , that my wife @entity41 died four years ago because of a heart attack brought on by the stress of his death , but also that they have not shown a shred of remorse			2
’ @entity5 was originally freed in september 2010 but was returned to jail last march after being seen in @entity81 , south @entity29 , and associating with gang members – both against the terms of his release			1
@entity5 was released in september last year after serving five years of his sentence			1

‘ serious offenders released on licence are subject to a strict set of conditions and controls			0
‘ if they fail to comply with their licence conditions , they are liable to be returned to custody			0
’ last month , @entity5 's father criticised the decision to give an obe to @entity107 , a cousin of the killers			1
he said he was ' totally against ' mr @entity88 being honoured for his work with youths , calling for stricter rules to be brought in over who should be eligible for honours			2
@entity114 , managing director of the @entity115 , said : ' we hope that this time @entity5 can keep himself out of trouble and the probation service can deliver the support he requires to do so			2
' there is , of course , absolutely zero evidence that he has been reformed and , like his brother , he has never shown remorse			0
' on this basis , as with every other victims organisation in the country , we do not understand why he was released in the first place			0
' what can we do , though ? the system is the system , and the system is flawed			0
' a @entity92 spokeswoman said : ' the decision to release recalled offenders from custody is made by the independent @entity96 - the body solely responsible in law for determining whether or not prisoners should be released			1
' serious offenders released on licence are subject to a strict set of conditions and controls			0
' examples include a strict curfew and other restrictions on their movements , as well as frequent meetings with their offender manager			0
' if they fail to comply with their licence conditions , they are liable to be returned to custody			0
' she went on : ' they will also be managed under the statutory @entity156 ( @entity156 )			0
