the best tressed : advice from celebrity hairstylists could mean you will look like @entity4 most of the time , we do n’t give it a second thought			2
it ’s our hair that we notice , that bothers and perplexes us			2
our scalp ? well , it ’s just ... there			2
but as hairdressers and trichologists – trained specialists who deal with hair problems – point out , the health of the scalp is fundamental to the look , feel and even the quantity of our hair			1
celebrity hairdresser @entity22 ( whose salons are responsible for the tumbling tresses of a-listers @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity4 ) feels strongly about this : ‘ in the same way that grass ca n’t grow in sand , hair ca n’t grow in an unhealthy scalp , ’ he says			1
so how can you keep yours in optimum condition ? the answer is to tend to it as assiduously as we do the skin on our faces			2
the age - old problem scalp – and therefore hair – problems become more apparent as we get older			1
@entity22 explains : ‘ as we age , our hair ages , too			1
with each passing year , our scalp and hair become more dehydrated while follicles become weaker			1
this leads to dryness , dullness , breakage and thinning			0
’ dr @entity53 , principal scientist for @entity54 ( @entity54 ) beauty , where for the past eight years she has focused her research on hair and scalp health , says : ‘ at some point in their adult life , 50 per cent of adults will experience some form of scalp concern			1
’ ‘ a healthy scalp should look similar to healthy skin ; flake - free , blemish - free , not overly oily and without redness or irritation , ’ says leading trichologist @entity66			1
‘ most people know if their scalp is unhealthy as it will be itchy , irritated and perhaps red , scaly or overly greasy , or both			1
you may also find small , raised pimples on the scalp			2
’ do n’t be a flake @entity66 continues : ‘ research shows that a flaky or itchy scalp can trigger or worsen hair shedding in both men and women			1
simply not washing your scalp regularly enough can allow for the build - up of flakes and an imbalance of micro-organisms – both of which can worsen , or trigger , hair loss			1
more severe scalp conditions , left untreated , such as psoriasis and seborrhoeic dermatitis , can lead to hair breakage and secondary infection from scratching			1
get your head examined if you think you might have a problem , a knowledgeable hairdresser can give you a first opinion			0
many salons that stock @entity101 , a specialist hair care range , have specialised magnifying cameras ( see phyto - haircare.co.uk for your nearest one )			2
any diseases can be identified and treatment suggested			0
cleanse and moisturise it ’s the skincare mantra most of us apply to a regular face regime – but should also be used for our scalp			2
firstly , take a look at what you ’re washing your hair in : most shampoos contain foaming sulphate - based ingredients ( commonly sodium lauryl sulphate , or @entity120 ) which remove oil from the hair – but also from the scalp , which can end up dry and inflamed			1
look for shampoos free from @entity120 , such as @entity125 ( £ 11 ; pureology - uk.com ) or branch out and try one of the many new ‘ @entity127 ’ in the shops			0
as the brand @entity131 puts it , ‘ smart girls do n’t strip ’ , a reference to the way its conditioner ( £ 17.99 at @entity136 ) will get your hair and scalp clean without stripping out all the oil from it			1
@entity142 ( £ 28 , @entity143 ) claims to hydrate and nourish rather like a face moisturiser			0
for a more budget - conscious option try @entity148 ’s @entity147 , which costs £ 5.99 for a big bottle at @entity150 or @entity151 ( £ 8.75 , lookfantastic.com )			0
exfoliate , exfoliate ... quality name : luxury brand @entity154 offers a range of hair ' rituals ' : treatments designed to nurture the hair and scalp , from £ 15 in the same way that we exfoliate our faces to get rid of dead cells that clutter up the surface and make skin look dull , it ’s a great idea to exfoliate your scalp			1
at home , try a product such as @entity172 , £ 32 ( 01925 578000 for stockists ) which you use before your normal shampoo to decongest your scalp ( it ’s gentle , so good even for sensitive - skinned scalps ) or @entity176 , £ 16 , www.philipkingsley.co.uk )			0
try a hydrating ritual intensive hydrating treatments to cosset and soothe the scalp are increasingly popular			0
luxury brand @entity154 offers a range of hair ‘ rituals ’ : treatments designed to nurture the hair and scalp , from £ 15 ( kerastase.co.uk )			1
at the @entity186 in @entity187 , the @entity188 and @entity189 ( £ 60 ) combines massage with aromatherapy essential oils ( avedainstitute.co.uk )			0
in salons such as @entity194 , the popular celeb - hairdresser in @entity196 ’s @entity195 ( michaeljohn.co.uk ) , you can try a @entity198 service ( from £ 15 )			0
it is designed to regenerate the scalp skin surface and reduce hair - loss			1
the treatment removes excess oil that builds up around the hair follicle , helping to restore the scalp to its optimum condition			1
pick up a tonic there is an array of scalp tonics on chemist shelves now			0
choose one backed by clinical trials			0
@entity213 from @entity214 ( £ 29.95 , nanogen.co.uk ) is popular with dermatologists and hair - transplant surgeons			0
another top - notch option is the new @entity218 in @entity66 ’s @entity220 kit ( from £ 50 for the drops , £ 95 for the whole kit , philipkingsley.co.uk ) which support hair health and growth via the scalp			1
blitz the dandruff dandruff is the fault of a tiny organism called malassezia globosa , which we all have on our scalps and which feeds on sebum , the oil produced by our hair follicles – though we ’re not all sensitive to it			0
if you are sensitive to malassezia , your scalp becomes irritated and sheds skin faster than it should – seen as dandruff			2
a shampoo containing zinc pyrithione ( @entity242 ) , such as @entity243 , will do the trick nicely , which is why this is the top - selling shampoo around the world			0
@entity101 produces the ‘ decongesting ’ @entity246 – a bracing mix of essential oils , £ 24.50 , that will soon get clogged follicles back to normal			0
if that does n’t work , see a specialist			0
@entity253 do n’t have any training in hair issues , surprisingly , but a trichologist could help you ( trichologists.org.uk ) as can a dermatologist who specialises in the scalp			2
dr @entity260 ( drdavidfention.com ) or dr @entity261 and dr @entity262 ( of londonhairspecialists.com ) can help with problematic scalp issues .			0

a healthy scalp should look similar to healthy skin , hairdressers say
celebrity stylist @entity22 believes : ' in the same way that grass ca **n't** grow in sand , hair ca **n't** grow on an unhealthy scalp '
