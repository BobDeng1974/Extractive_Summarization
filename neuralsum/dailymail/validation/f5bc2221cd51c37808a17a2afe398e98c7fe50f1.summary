@entity0 issued a public apology to his @entity3 teammates and the club ’s supporters on sunday after he was sent off in the defeat to @entity7 at @entity8 just 38 seconds after coming on as a half - time substitute			1
@entity0 , who was facing @entity7 for the last time before leaving @entity3 for @entity10 , was shown a straight red card by referee @entity12 when he reacted to a challenge from @entity14 with a senseless stamp on the @entity16			1
@entity7 went on to win 2 - 1 thanks to two goals from @entity19 as they moved five points clear of their arch - rivals in the race for a @entity24 place			1
@entity3 captain @entity0 spoke to @entity25 after the match to apologise to team - mates and fans ‘ i ’ve let down my teammates and the supporters , ’ admitted @entity0 , who now faces a three - match ban			1
‘ i take full responsibility			2
i need to accept it , the decision was right			2
‘ i 've been in the game long enough when you do something like that			2
i do n’t know what caused it , probably just a reaction to the initial tackle			2
‘ i should n’t say more about it really , i ’ve just come out here to apologise to the dressing - room and supporters			2
’ @entity48 expert @entity47 claimed that @entity0 may have been wound up by having to sit on the bench for such a big game before replacing @entity51			1
@entity19 ( top ) was on the receiving end of @entity0 's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch @entity3 manager @entity56 refused to castigate the veteran midfielder , and agreed that @entity3 ’s insipid first - half performance might have contributed to @entity0 ’s red mist			1
‘ i wo n’t criticise him because he ’s been brilliant in my time here , ’ said @entity56			2
‘ sometimes these things happen			2
‘ my thinking was always to go with the starting team			2
i had that clear in my mind and spoke with @entity0 earlier in the week about that			1
‘ of course he ’s a big - game player , a big impact player			2
he wanted to come in and it was just unfortunate that he got sent off			0
here is the stamp from @entity0 on @entity14 after both players had competed for the ball ‘ he was probably a little frustrated watching us in the first half , we did n’t make a tackle			1
‘ he ’s a highly competitive player and he made a great challenge when he first came on – it was probably our first challenge of the game , with all due respect			0
he wanted to help the team so much			0
‘ at least he was man enough to come out and make that apology			0
‘ with @entity0 it was purely wanting to make the impact			1
listen , he ’s made his apologies for it			0
of course in a big game you suffer when you play with 10 men against 11			0
‘ it happened , and great respect to the players that were on there that we kept fighting			0
games like that , especially when it goes to 2 - 0 against 10 men , you can get overrun and end up losing more goals			1
’ @entity0 is shown the red card by referee @entity12 after just 40 seconds of the second - half @entity103 could also come under scrutiny from the @entity105 if the referee confirms that he did not see an incident at the end in which the @entity3 defender appeared to stamp on @entity7 goalkeeper @entity109			1
the two players became an embroiled in an ugly confrontation that continued after the final whistle , but @entity56 insisted there was no malice on @entity103 ’s part			0
he added : ‘ the ball has been played through and it looks like it when it is slowed down , he has caught him with intent			0
i did n’t see it like that			0
‘ he is trying to get the ball			0
you see his foot up , that is a symbol when a player is just trying to get his toe on the ball because if he does that and the keeper brings him down , it is probably a penalty			0
’ @entity3 ’s first defeat in 14 @entity134 games since losing 3 - 0 at @entity135 in december puts a big dent in their hopes of beating @entity7 to a top - four place			1
@entity103 ( centre ) was lucky not to be cautioned for this stamp on @entity7 keeper @entity109 ‘ it ’s a big challenge , ’ admitted @entity56			1
‘ but when i looked at the 10 games that were remaining , it was always going to be difficult to win all 10			0
we built in a loss and some draws			0
‘ we hoped to win this game against a rival but it is still very much possible			0
we need to recover and use this as a springboard as we did when we last played them			0
’ @entity152 described the victory as ‘ one of the most important moments in my career ’ but refused to write off @entity3 ’s chances of qualifying for the @entity24			1
‘ we beat @entity3 again , ’ said @entity158			1
‘ they were in fantastic shape and we beat them with the old weapons – with the pressure on the ball in the first half			2
‘ now we are five points ahead of @entity3 , and six ahead of @entity165 and @entity166			1
to win in this moment is very important – one of the most important moments in my career			0
‘ but there are still eight matches to go			0
@entity3 can still be champions			1
when you are a top manager , our player or club – and @entity3 are – you have to deal with defeats			1
@entity3 manager @entity56 has a difficult afternoon with @entity0 being sent off ‘ we have also dealt with defeats			1
we lost at home to @entity180 and then we had to play against @entity165 and @entity3 , and you have to manage that			1
@entity3 can do that also because they have a great manager , great club , great fans			1
’ @entity7 dominated the first half and @entity19 fired them into a two - goal lead inside an hour			1
@entity188 pulled a goal back for the 10 men as @entity3 rallied after @entity0 ’s sending - off , but @entity158 ’s side could even afford to see @entity192 have a stoppage - time penalty saved by @entity194			1
‘ we played them off the pitch in the first half and scored a fantastic goal and gave nothing away , ’ said @entity158			1
‘ it was the best first 45 minutes ( of his time in charge of @entity7 ) because in the second half we were not so good and that ’s a little bit amazing because we played 11 against 10			1
it should be easier than the first half but it was not			2
@entity7 boss @entity152 ( right ) congratulates @entity206 ( left ) after the 2 - 1 victory ‘ i came in the dressing - room and gave all my compliments because i was so happy , but then in the second half everything changed because of the red card			1
then we were n’t laying like a team anymore			0
we were running with the ball and losing it unnecessarily			0
when we did n’t have the ball we did n’t press the opponent			0
that was different in the first half			2
‘ nevertheless , we did n’t give many chances away			0
@entity109 has saved us a lot of times this season but i could n’t remember one save in this match			0
’ @entity7 forward @entity19 salutes the travelling fans having scored a fine brace at @entity8 @entity19 has struggled to hold down a first - team place in recent weeks but produced arguably his best performance for @entity7 , crowned by a spectacular volley for the second goal			1
‘ yes , i think it ’s my best game in a @entity7 shirt , ’ said the @entity16			2
‘ it ’s a massive game , probably the biggest in @entity233 football , so to score two goals is great for me			0
‘ the second goal has to be up there with my best			0
after @entity0 was sent off we needed a second goal because they pushed us to the end			2
‘ it was important for me			0
the last few months i ’ve not had the best moment			0
it is the manager who decides but i ’m happy today			0
’ @entity7 players celebrate their vital 2 - 1 win at @entity8 against @entity3 on sunday			1
