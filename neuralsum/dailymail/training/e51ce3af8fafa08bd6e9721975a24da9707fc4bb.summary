not doctor @entity0 : @entity1 , 56 , insisted his @entity2 would not be following in predecessor @entity4 's footsteps by getting intimate with sidekick @entity5 , portrayed by 28 - year - old @entity6 incoming doctor who star @entity1 has revealed there will be no flirting with co-star @entity6 in the new series			1
the previous doctor was engaged in a close relationship with his sidekick @entity5 that even led to a passionate kiss			1
but @entity1 , 56 , insisted his @entity2 would not be following in predecessor @entity4 's footsteps by getting intimate with 28 - year - old @entity15 's character			1
' there 'll be no flirting , that 's for sure , ' he told @entity19			1
' it 's not what this doctor 's concerned with			1
' it 's quite a fun relationship , but no , i did call and say , " i want no @entity27 moments "			1
i think there was a bit of tension with that at first , but i was absolutely adamant			0
' the @entity33 comment relates to a series of 1990s @entity36 car adverts which hinted at a romance between an older man and a younger woman , before they were revealed to be father and daughter			2
@entity1 also had good news for those @entity48 purists who believe the show 's storylines have become over the top in the past few series			1
' it 's going to be a bit different from what we 've seen over recent years			2
a bit more gravity , ' he said			2
' some situations are more sombre and i think there are more rooted dramatic scenes			0
over the past two or three years , which i 've loved , there has often been a breathless vigour ; we still have that attack , but we have another level of drama , another tone			0
and the scenes are longer			0
' @entity1 recalled how his agent called him to tell him he had got the part when he was filming in @entity69 , and he spent the afternoon wandering around the city humming the doctor who theme tune			1
' i just did n't think it was something that would happen to me , ' he admitted			2
strictly platonic : @entity1 as @entity73 and @entity6 as @entity5 but the @entity75 actor did not say yes to the part immediately			1
' i did n't want to be @entity48 in a @entity48 i did n't like , ' he said			2
' i had to be convinced the show was going in a direction i was interested in			0
' i had to think carefully about the level of visibility			0
my life was blessed , but as soon as this happened i had paparazzi outside my house			0
people spoke to me before and recognised me , but nothing like this			0
' i had to decide if i was ready to live with that , because once that genie is out of the bottle , it does n't go back in			0
' @entity48 returns to @entity94 on august 23 .			0

the 56 - year - old says : ' it 's not what this doctor 's concerned with '
