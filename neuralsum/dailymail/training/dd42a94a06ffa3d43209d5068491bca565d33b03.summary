recognising that fitting both a healthy lifestyle and a dating life can be hard with today ’s hectic schedules , a gym in @entity8 has decided to combine the two			2
@entity12 allows you to take part in a yoga class while getting to meet and interact with other singles in the area , with the added bonus that you ’ve already seen them in @entity20			1
the classes contain a lot of couple and partner work , and are followed with a pub social @entity26 aims to help people connect with themselves , and thus make connections with other singles at a deeper level the class combines yoga , involving plenty of paired and couple work to allow people connect			1
the class , held each week at the @entity37 near @entity38 in @entity8 , is run by @entity39 , a trained acupuncturist who also works with other complementary and natural medicines and lifestyle practices such as @entity42			1
he began the singles yoga classes after noticing that yoga seemed to make people more sociable			1
@entity39 says : ‘ what better way to meet someone then when you are killer relaxed , full of feel good hormones and having engaged with a shared experience together ? ‘ when i first moved to @entity8 i used to follow each class with a social event and people felt more relaxed and able to chat			1
‘ what i ’ve noticed a lot in my classes is that people find it a lot easier to become embodied and keep their energy and attention			1
‘ the first 10 minutes of a class is generally a sequence that allows you to become focused on your own body			0
@entity39 is a trained acupuncturist and also works with other complementary and natural medicines and lifestyle practices such as @entity42 @entity39 demonstrates one of the coupled poses used in the @entity12 class ‘ where it gets interesting is when people have to meet and partner someone else			1
‘ i think this is similar to how we are in real life and how we are socially with people			0
‘ we do n’t meet people in an embodied place and so you do n’t have the same degree of presence about you			0
@entity85 , who goes to yoga once a week , says : ' using a yoga class as a way to meet men seems a bit strange			0
' yoga for me is about letting go , being totally in the moment and not allowing myself to be distracted by anything else – it ’s about having no ego			0
' i want to be free for that hour of worries about my appearance and whether i look fat in my lycra			0
the last place i want to be judged by a man is at my yoga class			0
' @entity104 , it is incredibly hard work so by the end of a class i always look so wiped out i ’m not sure i ’d be in a fit state to go to the pub. ' ‘ in the singles yoga i work with getting people to partner up and , moving very slowly , into doing the exercises from a focused and embodied place			2
‘ @entity114 have them put their attention inside themselves , staying very relaxed and then come into contact with the other person			0
‘ i think it is very good training for life in general			0
it ’s very common that we meet and engage with people and straight away we tighten up , but if we can stay embodied there can be a great energetic potency between two people			0
‘ i see a lot of people coming again and again because they have their eye on someone ! ’ to foster the connections made during the class - which generally lasts for about an hour and a half - the class ends with a pub social where you can chat to the other singles over a drink or three			1
in response to yoga fans who fear that combining yoga with a quest for romance goes against the aim of conventional yoga to remove all vanity and focus on your inner self @entity39 says : ‘ there are many different types of yoga and this is about helping people connect with others from a non-vain , embodied place			1
' yoga translates to unity and harmony - and this includes the world and people around us ' ' honest connection with people and finding harmony with others in itself is a life skill , and yoga is all about teaching life skills			2
’ the classes are open to all abilities , and cost £ 10 for both males and females , and @entity39 also runs ' @entity158 ' classes where people can make like - minded friends			1
