details of the case emerged in august at a public @entity43 hearing in @entity14 - where @entity24 , also of @entity21 , failed to persuade three appeal judges to rule that he had been unfairly jailed for contempt			1
@entity24 argued that repeated prison sentences for contempt of court were unfair and served no purpose			0
separated : @entity24 , left , and ms @entity1 , right , had an ' on - off ' relationship split - up before @entity1 was born however @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , disagreed and dismissed @entity24 's appeal			2

solicitor @entity68 , of law firm @entity66 - which has an office in @entity21 said : ' the father has said she is now in @entity18 but she could well be in the @entity70 - she could be anywhere			2
' we think that one possibility is that she is in the @entity75 area of @entity76			0
' we would urge people to look at her photograph and think very carefully if they might have seen her - maybe living nearby			2
' following @entity24 's failed appeal in august , @entity50 said it was ' impossible to underestimate ' the impact that the ' continued limbo ' was having on ms @entity1			0
ruling : three judges at the @entity8 ( pictured ) who jailed @entity24 for contempt of court several times said he would be released in april the girl 's mother told the @entity89 : ' with the lack of information , you just imagine the worst			1
' i 've had no contact with her			0
it must be so scary for her '			0
lord @entity50 said in august : ' this four - year - old girl has now not seen either of her parents for a period fast approaching two years			1
' she is fast growing up with no knowledge of or relationship with either her mother of father			0
