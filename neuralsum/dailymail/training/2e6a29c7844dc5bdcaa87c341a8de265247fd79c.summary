crawling with rats , sticky with mud and vibrating to the sound of guns booming day and night , life in the trenches was both dangerous and unpleasant			0
but there were some light - hearted moments as these rare photos reveal , with singers , can - can girls and concerts all laid on in a bid to keep spirits up			2
and it was n't just the army who benefited			0
one rare 1917 shot shows officers attempting an ' @entity19 dance ' during a naval revue on their ship			2
one such soldier was @entity31 , a @entity41 actor and comedian , who was signed up by the @entity43 in 1917			1
but generals , mindful of the morale - boosting impact of concerts and performances , soon pulled him off frontline duties , asking him instead to put together a stage show to entertain the troops			1
the resulting performance was known as @entity33 and included a mixture of slapstick comedy , vaudeville and music house tunes - all of which proved enormously popular with the men serving at the @entity60			1
amusing : a group of soldiers enjoy a performance by actress and singer @entity65 behind the lines in 1918 off duty : soldiers taking a break from the frontline dance with @entity71 at the @entity72 in @entity73 in 1916 highbrow : @entity74 was among the actresses to take to the stage in @entity77 but @entity31 was n't the only @entity41 star to relocate to the @entity60 for the later stages of the war			1
joining him on the frontline was @entity65 , an enormously popular comedienne and singer dubbed the ' queen of the @entity84 ' by her legion of fans			1
she too spent much of her time in @entity87 and @entity88 , amusing off - duty soldiers with her repertoire of risqué songs , which included such ditties as now you 've @entity94 - a huge hit with frontline troops			1
not every act to appear in @entity26 army messes had their roots in the music halls , however			2
others boasted a far more ancient pedigree , in particular the theatrical touring companies			0
many set up shop in @entity87 coastal towns such as @entity77 and @entity73 , bringing actresses of the calibre of @entity74 to @entity87 to appear in performances of plays by @entity112 among others			1
more performers still came from @entity116 's opera houses and concert venues , although for many troops , just getting away from the front was entertainment enough			2
others , as a simple shot of soldiers and volunteers from the @entity124 waltzing their way around a @entity73 casino , reveals , just wanted to relax			1
for sadly , many , although they did n't know it it at the time , were dancing their last dance as the war that cost the @entity26 a million young lives ground on			0
fame : @entity65 , a singer , was particularly popular with soldiers and made regular frontline appearances @entity65 was the queen of @entity84			2
she had made her debut as a table singer at the @entity139 , but soon she was the naughty phenomenon of the age			0
in her distinctive trill she warbled innocent - seeming lyrics with titles like @entity145 ! mr @entity146 , what shall i do ? and she ’d never had her ticket punched before that were loaded with double entendres – innocent enough today , but shocking to the @entity152 and @entity153			0
when the moralists protested about her song i sits among the @entity156 and @entity157 she amended it to i sits among the @entity156 and @entity159 – to howls of appreciation from her admirers			0
@entity65 had a colourful private life ; she was refused entry to the @entity165 at the start of a tour because she had shared a cabin on the voyage over with a man to whom she was not married			1
unlike fellow performer @entity172 , her ending was a sad one – she took to the brandy and fell over drunk on stage			0
the audience thought it was part of the act and roared with laughter , but she was mortally ill and died a few days later aged just 52			0
100,000 people came to her funeral			0
loved : @entity65 ( far right ) was one of music hall 's brightest stars but succumbed to alcoholism outpouring : when @entity65 died , aged just 52 years old , her funeral was attended by 100,000 people			1

men serving in @entity87 were treated to performances by music hall stars
others put on impromptu *cabaret* style shows behind the lines themselves
stars such as @entity65 and @entity31 regularly visited the front
the *government* employed @entity31 to write vaudeville to entertain men
other shows sprang up in towns such as @entity77 and @entity73
photos come from private *archives* opened for centenary *commemorations*
