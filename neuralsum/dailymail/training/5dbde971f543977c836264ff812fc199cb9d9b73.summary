the other plots the course of the @entity11 economy as chancellor of the exchequer and , as far as we know , restricts his singing to the shower			0
still , when you are the leader of the free world , it is easy to get mixed up on small details			0
@entity20 repeatedly referred to @entity21 as ‘ @entity22 ’ during @entity24 meetings this week in an embarrassing blow for the chancellor			1
but @entity21 responded today on @entity44 , writing : ' @entity46 you would n't suggest a duet if you 'd heard me sing			0
' mr @entity21 jetted into the second day of the @entity49 in @entity50 , determined to impress the world ’s most powerful leaders with his plan to get tough with global tax dodgers			1

mr @entity20 called him ‘ @entity22 ’ three times , to the visible embarrassment of the chancellor			1
‘ it was obvious @entity21 did n’t like being called “ @entity22 ” , ’ said a government source			1
‘ why would he ? his name is @entity21			0
’ in fact the chancellor ’s real name is @entity70 but switched to @entity21 aged 13 as a ‘ small act of rebellion ’			0
today the soul singer said he was delighted to get a namecheck at the @entity49			1
and in a bizarre twist suggested singing a duet up with the chancellor			2
@entity30 told @entity78 : ' i was really delighted , actually			2
i was really not aware that he was that much of a fan that he would call the chancellor @entity30			2
' tell the chancellor when i come over i will have to hook up with him and we will do a duet of on @entity60 , or something			2
' @entity30 's entry in online encyclopaedia @entity87 was edited by a mischievous user to reflect mr @entity20 's inadvertent appointment of the singer to the @entity91			1
after being tampered with , the entry read : ' @entity30 ( born march 9 , 1948 ) is an @entity29 funk and @entity31 musician , songwriter , lyricist , former lead singer of the band , @entity98 , and as of june 2013 , is the chancellor of the exchequer and @entity100			1
' the bogus information remained online for under an hour before being erased			0
unattractive : @entity102 welcomed the @entity29 president to @entity104 , but mr @entity20 joked that @entity105 was the better = looking half of the coalition joke : mr @entity21 failed the see the funny side of the president 's slip - up , which has become the talk of @entity113 the name gaffe by mr @entity20 comes despite mr @entity21 boasting of his close links with the @entity117			1
after delivering a 90 - minute presentation on global data - sharing plans to stop companies and individual ’s hiding their profits in tax havens , mr @entity21 was left deflated when mr @entity20 responded : ‘ thanks for that , @entity22			1
’ handsome : deputy prime minister @entity105 could not hide his delight at being described as better looking than the pm by president @entity20 but the two men could not be more different			1
the chancellor is the son of sir @entity131 , 17th baronet of @entity133 and @entity134			0
by contrast the father of singer - songwriter @entity30 was @entity137 , a trumpet player who played with @entity139 and @entity140			2
he had a total of 12 children but died when @entity22 was just 13			2
in an attempt to make amends , mr @entity20 insisted that he did know mr @entity21 ’s name really			2
‘ i ’m sorry , man			0
i must have confused you with my favourite @entity31 singer , ’ he said			1
mr @entity21 was not the only @entity11 minister to be left put out by the president			0
when deputy prime minister @entity105 arrived in @entity104 , mr @entity20 greeted him with a swipe at @entity102 , @entity151 reported			1
‘ it 's good to see the better looking half of the @entity155 , ’ he said			0
today mr @entity105 could barely contain his delight at the compliment			0
