@entity56 , @entity57 , said : ' the mantelpiece fell and struck him , the fireplace had been designed by mr @entity4 and was fitted by his employees			1

' when they arrived the door was answered by @entity16 who was excited to have visitors			2

' on entering the room the found @entity16 slumped against the fireplace with the mantelpiece across his chest in two			1
' emergency services were called , mrs @entity64 arrived home shortly before and @entity16 and mr @entity80 were air - lifted to hospital where he died			2

@entity4 was n’t charged until six years after the incident and pleaded guilty to failing to discharge his duty with the design and installation of the fireplace - thereby exposing @entity16 to danger			1
lawyers acting for @entity39 ( @entity94 ) and its @entity95 - based parent company @entity39 , who had sub-contracted @entity4 , entered not guilty pleas to failing in the construction of homes , ' to ensure persons not in employment were not exposed to risks to their health and safety '			1

the news of the incident involving @entity16 extinguished his business virtually overnight			2
' for everyone connected with this case seven and a half years since @entity16 ’s tragic death must feel like a lifetime			2

' we feel that the house builder , @entity39 , and the fireplace installer , @entity208 , were responsible for the death of our son			0
' unfortunately , due to irregularities in the @entity214 investigation the case against @entity39 was dropped in april 2013			0
' we have waited nearly eight years for the matter to eventually be finalised through the court which is in our opinion far too long to prolong the suffering and distress to our family			0
' whatever the outcome of the @entity214 prosecutions , nothing will bring back @entity16 , but we want to insure that something is done to prevent incidents like this happening to any other child in the future ' since the inquest in 2008 we are aware of at least two further children that have tragically been killed in incidents involving fire places			1
' we can not help but feel that had the matter been dealt with more promptly and in a different manner by all those involved at least one of those needless deaths may have been prevented			0
