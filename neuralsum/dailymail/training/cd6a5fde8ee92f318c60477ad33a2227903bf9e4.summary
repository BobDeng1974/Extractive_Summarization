tennis ace @entity0 is set to move into a £ 6.5million glass mansion in a @entity3 tax - haven on the shores of @entity5			1
@entity0 and his family are set to move in to the state - of - the - art three - storey building at the end of the year , and are believed to be joined by his parents @entity11 and @entity12 , who could be the new residents in the two luxury apartments being build in addition to the main home			1
the building , called @entity17 , is located in @entity18 in @entity19 , and comes with floor - to - ceiling windows , a swimming pool and large balconies with magnificent views stretching across @entity5			1
located about 20 minutes drive from @entity5 , and an hour from @entity31 , @entity18 is one of the lowest tax municipalities in @entity36 and the liberal tax structure has attracted other multi-millionaires			1
@entity40 drivers @entity41 and @entity42 and the former @entity44 chairman @entity43 have all chosen to live in the canton			2
@entity0 's new glass - walled home , being built on a plot of about 1.5 acres with underground parking , is believed to be worth £ 6.5million			1
the 500sq.m property will have plenty of room for @entity0 , @entity33 and their two sets of twins – five - year - old girls @entity56 and @entity58 and boys @entity60 and @entity61 , born last may			1
30 – love : @entity0 and former tennis player wife @entity33 , pictured left and right in 2009 , when @entity33 was pregnant with their oldest set of twins , met when they were both representing @entity3 in the @entity67 and married in april 2009 decent view : a computer - generated image shows what appears to be the @entity72 ' en - suite master bedroom space to chill : @entity18 , located about 20 minutes from @entity5 , is considered a ' tax haven ' and is one of the lowest tax municipalities in @entity36 due to the location on the hillside and the property overlooking the water , there will be no insight into the home , despite the glass walls @entity0 famously likes to take his whole brood on the road , and brought both sets of twins to @entity89 this year , despiter @entity60 and @entity61 being just a few weeks old			1
he said at a press conference after his sons were born that taking them all on the road is hard work but worth it			0
' my wife does a lot of work , as much as she can			0
and i try to help as much as i can , ' he explained			0
' we have the grandparents as well and all my team members , they sometimes just tag along			0
clearly we also need some help on the road , so @entity33 can have an opportunity sometimes to sleep in a little bit , or come to watch one of my matches			0
' you need to be well organised , but by now we know how it works			0
i am looking forward to life on the tour with the family , and it will be a long time without any travelling after the tennis is over			2
so i 'm looking forward to the next couple of years now			0
' scores of builders have been working to get the impressive structure completed this year , described as ' prestigious , contemporary architecture with extensive glazing , ' by the developer , @entity122			0
the additional flats are believed to be for @entity0 's parents @entity11 and @entity12 , pictured here with @entity126 and the couple 's oldest daughters , @entity129 and @entity130 , during the 2012 @entity89 tournament happy neighbours : the surrounding properties are built in similar luxurious style , climbing on the hillside and overlooking the water entrance : a computer constructed image shows how the @entity0 family 's new home will be accessed from the road			2
