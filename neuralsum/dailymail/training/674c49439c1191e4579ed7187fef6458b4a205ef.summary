beaming smile , arms outstretched and sliding on his knees into the corner flag , revelling in the adulation that was showered upon him			0
@entity9 had scored 176 goals for @entity11 before tuesday night , including strikes that defined @entity14 and domestic finals , but no 177 seemed different , sweeter almost			1
it was , perhaps , a reminder of his ability to produce just when it matters			0
with all the speculation surrounding his contract , all the conjecture about whether he will stay at @entity20 or pursue a fresh challenge next year , @entity9 could not have provided a more telling riposte when he burst into @entity24 ’s area in the 54th minute to settle a game @entity11 needed to win			1
without him here , another two points would have been squandered			0
‘ it ’s not about me , ’ he pointed out			0
‘ it should be about a great team performance			0
’ @entity9 can argue the praise should be spread but @entity11 are unbeaten in three games – their best sequence of the campaign – thanks to him , his goal sandwiched by strikes from @entity37 and @entity41 after @entity33 raised the prospect of a shock			1
this is exactly what @entity116 – and his captain – required			0
restored , as expected , to the starting line - up after a weekend break , he was left in no doubt by the fans in the visiting section over his place in their affections			1
his name was sung loudly and frequently , the songs drowning out barbs from @entity24 ’s supporters : do no doubt the vast majority of @entity133 want him to prolong the relationship they have shared into a seventeenth campaign			2
@entity11 ’s ambitions , though , should not be so intrinsically linked to @entity9			1
at 34 , he should not be carrying the team			0
others have to take responsibility , not least the expensive acquisitions who arrived during the summer as part of the restructuring programme			0
that is why @entity116 will have been satisfied to see @entity37 score @entity11 ’s opener			1
things may not have not been smooth since he left @entity39 but this was more like it , his second goal of the campaign coming at just the right time			2
crisp and instant , it was a terrific left - foot finish , drilled in after @entity53 headed @entity76 ’s high - ball into his path			2
there looked to be some fury in his fist - jabbing celebration but , on the bench , @entity116 only briefly acknowledged it			0
what had happened five minutes prior had dulled his mood			0
a significant part of @entity11 ’s troubles so far have stemmed from an inability to keep clean sheets and – more accurately – their bewildering ability to give away cheap goals			2
@entity171 was this more evident than here			0
@entity24 mascot @entity174 greets some young home fans at the @entity94 ahead of the game @entity9 warms up after being restored to the starting line - up , having been dropped for the weekend 's game against @entity180 @entity11 winger @entity77 ( right ) causes @entity24 defender @entity181 ( left ) problems in the opening half @entity24 striker @entity33 ( left ) takes a shot at goal after a counter attacking move started by @entity61 @entity33 's effort hits the post before rebounding off goalkeeper @entity35 ( centre ) for an own goal @entity35 ( bottom ) can only watch as the ball ricochets off his back and rebounds into the empty net for @entity24 's opener @entity33 ( left ) celebrates @entity24 's opening goal , despite it being awarded as an own goal from @entity35 @entity24 players rush to congratulate the striker after taking the lead on 22 minutes at the @entity94 @entity35 made another gaffe to give @entity24 the lead - click here for all the stats from @entity206 @entity61 ( 9 ) broke away after @entity71 lost possession to lead to @entity24 taking the lead @entity9 ( right ) orchestrates play from central midfield as @entity11 chase the game in the opening half @entity38 ( left ) competes with @entity53 ( right ) in an aerial duel in the lead up to @entity11 's equaliser @entity116 ’ idea is to have a goalkeeper who is comfortable with the ball at his feet and give assurance to his defence but @entity35 is doing nothing of the sort at present , his performances a constant worry to his manager and team - mates			1
he had been ordered to go back to basics in the 1 - 0 win against @entity180 – make saves , give it simple – but none of those instructions were carried over and a ridiculous error in the 19th minute almost handed @entity24 the lead , when @entity35 gave the ball straight to @entity57			1
the @entity234 could not make him pay , his left foot shot zipping fractionally wide , but the reprieve was only temporary as in the next attack @entity24 had the lead			1
@entity11 , farcically , failed to clear their lines when defending a counterattack			2
@entity61 caused the trouble , sprinting at @entity11 ’s back four			2
@entity35 was weak and needed @entity73 to head @entity61 ’s shot off the line but he could n’t gather the rebound and @entity33 profited , his left - foot drive ending in the net via rebounds off the post and the back of the @entity250 ’s head			1
shaking his head in disbelief , @entity35 stood with his hands on his hips , smiling ruefully			2
this , however , was no laughing matter			0
the longer he continues to be found wanting , the more vulnerable his side will be			0
it is an issue @entity11 must address			2
on this occasion , it did n’t prove costly			0
high on endeavour and brimming with determination , @entity24 did not play like the worst team in the @entity264 but every error they make is being ruthlessly punished			1
nobody knows that better than @entity53			0
having teed up @entity37 , he provided the ‘ assist ’ for @entity9 to gleefully smash home in the 54th minute , after he tried to cut out a centre from @entity77 after @entity37 and @entity41 had combined			1
it was his first goal in open play since january 28			0
@entity53 ’s night reached its nadir on the hour when his weak back pass allowed @entity38 a free run at goal			1
floundering , @entity53 yanked @entity38 ’s arm back and sent him sprawling and gave referee @entity86 a simple decision			1
red card , game over			0
@entity24 should have been down to nine when @entity45 collided with @entity9 but frustrations were only temporary			1
@entity45 erred in the 84th minute , @entity77 cut the ball back and @entity41 swept in			1
@entity9 , fittingly , celebrated that one with relish , too			0
