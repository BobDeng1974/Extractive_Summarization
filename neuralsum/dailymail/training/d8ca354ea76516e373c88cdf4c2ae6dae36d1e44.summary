by @entity0 from defiant @entity3 protesters to thronging markets and tube stations , these striking photographs capture 30 years of life in @entity8 's capital			1
the lively black and white images were taken by @entity10 , who gave up his job as a watchmaker in @entity13 to turn his photography into a life - long passion			1
he chronicled the rise of @entity17 and @entity18 for the ill - fated tv mirror magazine - until it went bust because only @entity21 had the right to print coveted television listings			1
all change , please : a royal guard marching outside @entity26 during the @entity27 in around 1955			0
a series of street photographs of @entity31 life by @entity10 , who rose to fame for his depictions of celebrities including singer @entity17 and comedian @entity18 , has gone on display at the @entity36 familiar sight : many things have changed in central @entity31 since 1960 , but some things have remained depressingly similar - including the capital 's wet weather collection : children gather around a pile of comics for sale at @entity47 in around 1947			1
this is one of mr @entity10 ' earliest works , when he was still a watchmaker but he continued a dazzling career , much of it spent on @entity31 's streets , right up until his death in 2002 aged 78			1
born in @entity31 's @entity55 , the photojournalist never married or had children and was instead wedded to the job			1
he captured crowds at the royal wedding of @entity61 and @entity62 alongside street protests against the @entity3 with the same vibrancy as everyday market scenes near his childhood home of @entity68			0

mr @entity10 ' cousin @entity76 worked as his assistant for almost 50 years			2
the 75 - year - old , who now lives in @entity79 , @entity80 , told @entity81 : ' his style was strictly candid - he worked best when the subjects did n't realise he was there			0
life is a blur : using techniques ahead of his time such as a slow shutter speeds , the photographer bestowed new depth on scenes like this one in 1960 at victoria station moments in history : left , clashes at an @entity97 riot in @entity98 between supporters , protestors and the police in around 1960			1
sir @entity97 was a leader of the @entity8 fascist movement			0
right : a photographer peers through the railings at @entity105 the day before the @entity106 in 1953 documentary : the photographer adopted a candid style but occasionally one of his subjects would catch his eye , such as in this photo at @entity114 fish market ' he would go around things like the @entity55 markets and do things along the south coast			1
' he just picked people at random			0
he had this kind of eye , you know - he saw something immediately and it would be recorded			2
he admired the work of @entity125 and tried to emulate him			0
' he took rolls and rolls of film , particularly if he thought something was special			0
i went to the royal wedding with him and i spent most of the day just feeding him film			0
' he was very much a londoner so he did n't have to think about where he needed to go			0
he just had this instinct for street life			0
' born in 1924 , mr @entity10 lasted just days serving in the @entity137 when he was called up at the age of 18			0
fighting in @entity139 , @entity140 , he stepped on a land mine which almost destroyed his leg and spent six months recovering in a hospital in @entity144			0
later he would describe the blast to family members as a ' blessing in disguise '			0
a very @entity149 day out : well - dressed women attending the @entity151 at @entity152 in 1960 - and all looking at the scores a day at the races : a spectator reads a newspaper at @entity157 , @entity158 , on @entity159 in around 1960			2
mr @entity10 also took his work outside the city another spectator at the racecourse on @entity159 , held every year in june and the highlight of the racing season at @entity157 , attracting a varied crowd when he returned to @entity31 , the skyline was changing by the day as historic war - damaged buildings were torn down and high - rise blocks provided new places for city - dwellers to live			1
while @entity10 ’ portfolio was dominated by portraiture , from stars of the screen to eminent artists , the new exhibition shines a light on his documentary work			1
the 50 images on display were selected to show @entity10 ’ observational skills when photographing within crowded places			1
drawn from his days both as an amateur and later professional photographer , their subjects range from the buzzing @entity189 at night to the porters of @entity191 – which @entity10 photographed over five consecutive mornings , starting at 4am			0
he recorded crowds at @entity152 in 1960 , central @entity31 in the grip of rush hour and protests against the politics of @entity97			1
swinging @entity198 : a couple kissing at a @entity201 party in @entity202 in 1959			0
the @entity204 programme of the same name was one of the most pop music radio shows of its day beyond the city : many of mr @entity10 ' photos were shot beyond the boundaries of @entity31 , this image of five pensioners was taken on @entity215 in around 1955 queuing : some @entity8 traditions will never die			2
before the days of automated ticket gates , these crowds huddled towards a single inspector at @entity220 in 1960 successful : @entity10 ( pictured ) left his job as a watchmaker in @entity13 in the early 1950s and carved out a successful career as a photojournalist in the capital the photographs are going on show at the @entity36 , which has an estimated 150,000 photos in a collection built up over the last 102 years			1
the exhibition will also show the photographer ’s contact sheets for the very first time , shedding light on his methods			2
@entity236 , the museum 's curator of photography , said : ' in his documentary photography , @entity10 honed the art of successfully detaching a person or telling moment from a busy scene or making remarkable images of the crowd itself			2
' he is an inspirational figure in @entity31 ’s 20th century photography , providing a fabulous visual record of our capital			2
' observing the crowd : photographs by @entity10 is free and will run at the @entity36 from friday , may 16 to friday , july 13 .			2
