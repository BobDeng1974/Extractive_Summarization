family man : former @entity13 officer @entity10 revealed his wife had no formal training as a spy , but occasionally helped in his operations ' we were transporting it across a border to deliver to an agent so he could install it and so we could have regular communications with him			1
' my spouse was an integral part of that effort as she was with many more			2
' asked whether his wife had training as a spy , he said : ' no training but just through the course of necessity while raising three children			1
' @entity10 , who also led the team hunting @entity48 , described the wife he met in @entity50 as a ' terrific partner in marriage and in espionage '			1
' i owe her everything , ' he added			2
the former officer ran one of the spy agency 's secret domestic networks conducted counter-intelligence within the @entity3 as the chief of the @entity13 's @entity62			1
@entity10 also led the @entity3 response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and talked about the months in @entity65 after @entity3 declared war on the country and the @entity13 led the mission to topple the @entity69			1
ex-cia : @entity10 spoke to @entity20 's @entity71 regarding his pessimism about how many foreign spies there are in the @entity3 varied : @entity10 served as deputy director of the @entity13 's @entity12 and led the @entity3 response to 9/11 , as well as being on loan to the @entity78 in his book , @entity79 , he tells how he learned about insurgency first - hand from @entity83 rebels			1
he learned about blood feuds from @entity65 tribal leaders and he learned that @entity87 terrorists and enemy agents from @entity89 all have a weakness for porn			2
@entity10 said : ' i never met a @entity89 that did not like pornography			1
' telling interviewer @entity71 what he would have to do in his line of work , @entity10 said : ' supplying porn to a @entity89 official to entice them to spy for @entity3 , along with money or whatever else it might take			1
well , for me the answer was yes , i was willing to do that			2
' @entity10 also told how he led a special unit tasked with finding @entity48 five years before 9/11 and , in late summer 1999 , had the @entity106 leader in his sights - but was refused permission to kill him			1
he said : ' from 98 , ' 99 all the way up to 2001 , the warnings were there			2
we had extensive human networks in @entity65 , @entity65 sources that had been reporting on @entity87 , on the presence of @entity48			1
' ' i would hazard to guess there are more foreign intelligence officers inside the @entity3 working against @entity3 interests now than even at the height of the @entity122			2
it 's a critical issue			2
' @entity10 but @entity10 said president @entity125 's @entity124 did n't trust the @entity13 's @entity65 sources alone and they wanted @entity3 eyes on the target			1
' so we were driven to look at various technical options			2
and we looked at a range of things			2
long - range optics , they were too heavy , too cumbersome to get over the mountains			1
' we looked at balloons			0
the prevailing winds would take those balloons to @entity139			0
that would be a bad thing			0
and then we stumbled across the @entity143 , particularly the @entity144			0
' and sure enough , was n't long before we had the @entity144 in theater over @entity65 , the @entity144 unarmed at the time			0
and our human sources took us to a village -- far -- not far from @entity148			0
' we saw a security detail , a convoy and we saw @entity48 exit the vehicle			1
and we had -- the optics were spot on			0
it was beaming back to us , @entity13 headquarters			0
' we immediately alerted the @entity124			0
and the @entity125 administration 's response was , " well , it will take several hours for the @entity161 , the cruise missiles launched from submarines , to reach that objective			0
so you need to tell us where @entity48 will be five or six hours from now			1
" the frustration was enormous			0
' @entity10 said he wanted to kill the terrorist there and then , but was denied permission			1
speaking about the amount of foreign spies on @entity3 soil , he told @entity20 : ' if you look at the threat that is imposed upon our nation every day , some of the major nation states - @entity139 in particular - have very sophisticated intelligence operations , very aggressive operations against the @entity3 ' i would hazard to guess there are more foreign intelligence officers inside the @entity3 working against @entity3 interests now than even at the height of the @entity122			2
it 's a critical issue			0
' he also expressed his concerns about what @entity87 are doing in @entity50 and the danger they pose			0
' i 'm particularly concerned about @entity87 in @entity189 , which is fractured as a nation state			0
the @entity194 , if you look at @entity87 in @entity193 , they pose a threat , and in @entity196			0
those are the places i 'd be concerned , ' he said			0
he also believes the @entity3 government should not withdraw the troops too quickly as he fears @entity87 could make a comeback in @entity65			0
he said : ' you 've got so many mistakes on the @entity3 side , and you 've got a feckless , corrupt government on the @entity65 side			0
