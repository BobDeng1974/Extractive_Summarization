@entity0 , pictured , has refused to release 25 personal letters written to former @entity3 president @entity2 a personal letter written by @entity0 to @entity2 backing his plan to wage war on @entity7 has reportedly ‘ gone missing ’ from the official presidential library – as pressure grows on the former prime minister to sanction the release of the private notes he wrote to mr @entity2			1
the letter , which is said to begin with the words : ‘ you know , @entity2 , whatever you decide to do , i ’m with you ’ , was last night described by a senior figure involved in the diplomatic negotiations at the time as ‘ absolutely critical ’ to the public ’s understanding of the war – because it reveals the extent to which mr @entity0 gave mr @entity2 a ‘ blank cheque ’			1
mr @entity0 ’s refusal to authorise the publication of 25 personal letters and 130 official records of conversations with mr @entity2 has led to a long delay in the publication of sir @entity33 ’s official report into the war			1
sir @entity33 held his last public hearings in 2011			1
on friday , @entity36 made public his frustration , saying the report should be published by the end of the year			0
mr @entity0 , backed by cabinet secretary sir @entity40 – a key member of his inner circle during the build - up to the 2003 conflict – has argued that the sensitive documents should remain classified			1
but mr @entity36 has now effectively told sir @entity40 to reach a compromise under which a ‘ sensible ’ proportion of the correspondence is released			0
the development comes as lawyers for the @entity3 government are deciding whether to release any of the documentation under @entity3 freedom of information laws			0
since january – nine years after the conclusion of @entity2 ’s first term in office – the letters have technically been available to researchers who ask for them , if they are cleared by a vetting committee of lawyers			2
but the lawyers have indicated to researchers based in the @entity62 that the only correspondence they have not been able to find is the ‘ i ’m with you ’ letter , sent by mr @entity0 in july 2002 , nine months before the outbreak of war			2
the letter , which was hand - delivered by mr @entity0 ’s foreign policy adviser sir @entity68 to @entity3 national security adviser @entity69 , has been referred to indirectly in political memoirs covering the period			2
when mr @entity0 was questioned by the @entity72 in 2011 , he denied the specific wording of ‘ i ’m with you whatever ’ – but admitted he thought it would have been ‘ profoundly wrong ’ not to honour commitments he had previously given to the @entity3 president			2
mr @entity0 ’s critics suspect he has been hoping to delay the @entity82 report – which is likely to prove personally damning as well as awkward for the @entity83 – until after next year ’s general election			1
sources say the letters were ‘ pretty much one way ’ with @entity2 ‘ failing to respond in a similarly personal manner ’			1
a letter written by @entity0 , left , to @entity2 , right , has gone missing from the @entity90 last night , a @entity62 - based source involved in the effort to obtain the release of the letters told @entity95 : ‘ the lawyers are taking months to evaluate the letters and decide whether to release them			1
‘ however , they claim not to have been able to locate the ‘ ‘ with you whatever ’ ’ letter			0
’ one senior figure involved in the 2002 negotiations between @entity102 and @entity103 told this newspaper : ‘ there is absolutely no point in having this inquiry if the letters are kept secret			0
they are completely pivotal to our understanding			0
‘ and the ‘ ‘ i ’ll be with you ’ ’ letter is the most critical of all – it gave the green light			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s office did not respond to requests for comment .			0
