@entity0 , who has a long history of stealing low - value items , was given a @entity10 ( @entity11 ) in february , barring him from the centre of @entity13 , @entity14			1
but 54 - year - old @entity15 , who is well - known to local security teams , was spotted last month in @entity17			1
it was the latest breach of his order - and he was sent to prison for 28 days			0
police say the threat of jail does not stop @entity15 , but claim the @entity11 means they can at least arrest him before he causes any serious trouble			1
@entity28 's @entity27 , of the @entity29 , said : ‘ it ’s how prolific he is that ’s the problem			0
@entity33 does n’t stop him - being inside is just an occupational hazard			1
‘ i have been an officer for 12 years and the number of convictions he has is well above anyone else i ’ve ever come across			0
‘ but the @entity11 gives us a chance to arrest him before he manages to commit a crime			1
it gives us another string to our bow that helps us prevent crime before it gets too far			0
‘ the order has not been issued lightly			0
he is not shoplifting because we are getting to him first			0
’ sighting : @entity15 was spotted at @entity17 ( pictured ) in @entity13			2
it was the latest breach of his order famous seafront : @entity15 has been barred from the town centre of @entity13 , @entity14 ( file picture ) @entity53 , security officer at @entity54 ’s in @entity13 , said : ‘ he was arrested once in here for breaching his order and since then we ’ve not seen him			1
‘ we had stopped him three or four times this year before that so that has got to be good going			0
he was in all the time before			0
’ ' @entity33 does n’t stop him - being inside is just an occupational hazard ' @entity62 @entity27 but the nature of @entity15 ’s offences means he is unlikely to face a significant stretch behind bars any time soon			1
@entity67 added : ‘ if you asked town centre stores , they would probably be relieved at a longer period of time but would it stop him committing offences ? probably not			2
‘ i do n’t think @entity0 is a particularly nasty person			2
he just does n’t see the consequences and he doesnt fear them			0
i think any officer you ask in @entity79 would say they know @entity0			2
