by @entity0 published : 18:35 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 01:34 est , 30 july 2013 famous character : the chief suspects in a robbery in @entity4 are a gang known as the @entity6 the novelist @entity7 called the @entity8 a sunny place for shady people			1
on sunday , one particularly shady customer dropped into @entity4 — and swiftly high - tailed it out again £ 88million the richer			1
in a staggeringly brazen heist , the lone raider marched into the @entity15 , the most glamorous hotel in the city			1
there , cool as ice , his face concealed by a motorcycle helmet , he threatened hotel staff with an automatic pistol before swiping a pile of diamonds and other gems from an exhibition in the lobby being held by @entity28 , one of the world ’s top jewellers			2
right under the noses of hotel security guards , the masked crook shovelled the jewels into a briefcase and then calmly strolled off down the @entity37 — the seafront promenade where film stars , models and billionaires go to see and be seen			1
in recent years , the @entity37 has also become a favoured haunt for the world ’s most audacious diamond thieves			0
in may , during the annual @entity46 , £ 1million of jewellery was taken from the safe in the hotel room of an @entity50 jeweller working for @entity51 , one of @entity54 ’s most famous diamond merchants			1
only days later , a £ 1.6million necklace was lifted by a crook at a film industry party just down the coast at the even more exclusive resort of @entity60			1
the @entity15 itself — the epicentre of @entity8 glamour ever since it was built in 1911 — has proved a particularly irresistible target			1
in august 1994 , three machine gun - toting crooks stormed into the hotel ’s jewellery shop and cleared its shelves of £ 39million worth of gems			1
they have never been caught			0
heist : the @entity15 in the @entity8 @entity8 resort of @entity4 where the robbers struck on sunday but the raid this weekend was more outrageous still			1
first estimates put the value of the stolen jewellery at £ 35million			2
now , following a detailed inventory of the missing jewels , the @entity8 police believe they may be worth as much as £ 88million			1
the robbery could have come straight out of a @entity83 heist movie — and , indeed , in an intriguing case of life imitating art , the @entity4 was the setting for the 1955 @entity89 movie to catch a thief			1
@entity91 plays a suave , retired cat burglar suspected of stealing diamonds belonging to the millionaire mother of his gorgeous love interest , @entity97			0
but that ’s not the only @entity83 twist , for the chief suspects in the robbery are a gang known as the @entity6 , taking their nickname from the first @entity105 film about an international thief intent on stealing the world ’s largest diamond — the eponymous @entity109			1
in the past , the gang — who have struck all over the world — have made provocative , teasing references to the film			1
after a 2002 raid on @entity116 ’s , a @entity118 jeweller , one gang member , @entity119 from @entity120 , hid a £ 500,000 blue diamond ring in his girlfriend ’s jar of face cream — a ploy used in the @entity109 comedy			1
but there was nothing funny about the attack			0
during the raid , @entity119 ’s accomplice brandished a loaded @entity134 revolver , and the gang stole £ 23million worth of jewellery — only £ 3million of which has been recovered			1
in may 2005 , @entity116 ’s was attacked a second time — again , it is thought , by the @entity6			1
this time , £ 1million of gems were taken			2
only last thursday , one of the @entity109 ringleaders , a 34 - year - old @entity143 , @entity144 , broke out of a @entity54 prison			0
he had been serving a six - year sentence for another diamond robbery in @entity148 , @entity54 , in 2009			2
during last week ’s jailbreak , a group of his accomplices battered their way into @entity154 prison by driving a van , pedal to the floor , through the front gate			0
they then kept prison guards at bay with a hail of automatic gunfire from their @entity165 assault rifles , as @entity166 and another man — a @entity54 kidnapper called @entity168 — scaled the prison walls and jumped into a waiting van , which sped off			0
investigation : police cars are parked outside the @entity4 on sunday after one particularly shady customer dropped in - and swiftly high - tailed it out again £ 88 million the richer as if this was n’t embarrassing enough for the @entity54 authorities , @entity168 had escaped from the same jail before , in 1992			1
and only in may this year , a third member of the @entity109 gang escaped from the @entity180 in the @entity54 town of @entity182			2
the suspicion is that @entity166 , reunited with his old partners in crime , then co-ordinated sunday ’s raid in @entity4			2
he had plenty of partners to choose from			0
for the @entity6 are a loose affiliation of up to 200 thieves , many of them ex-soldiers from the former @entity193 , hardened by the @entity195 wars			1
the group is thought to have been involved with burglaries worth more than £ 380million across 120 jewellery shops in more than 20 countries , from the @entity50 to @entity54 , and @entity200 to @entity201			2
police suspect the @entity6 of everything from drug - trafficking to murder — but what the gang especially like is old - fashioned jewel theft police suspect the @entity6 of everything from drug - trafficking to murder — but what the gang especially like is old - fashioned jewel theft			1
the techniques used in their raids are straightforward : not much more than a classic smash - and - grab			0
but they like to spice up their crimes with a dash of movie heist daring			0
in one raid in @entity224 , on the western coast of @entity222 , they gave a public bench near their target jewellery shop a fresh coat of paint to stop any passers - by sitting there and becoming accidental witnesses			0
in 2007 , during a raid on a shop in @entity237 , a high - end shopping district in @entity238 , suspected members of the gang stole a £ 1.5million diamond tiara			1
after spraying three saleswomen with tear gas — temporarily blinding but not otherwise harming them — they helped themselves to a tiara , necklaces and other gems			0
security footage showed the gang members calmly walking into the store dressed in slim - fitting suits and crisply ironed white shirts			2
one even carried an umbrella			0
they were in and out of the shop in just 36 seconds and made their getaway on bicycles , weaving in and out of the heavy traffic			0
police : right under the noses of hotel security guards , the masked crook shovelled the jewels into a briefcase and then calmly strolled off down the @entity37 - the seafront promenade where stars go to see and be seen they used another novel mode of getaway transport in 2005 in @entity267 , where the gang raided a jewellery store before making their escape in a speedboat			1
they wore masks over their faces and garish , floral - print @entity276 shirts			0
when they attacked a branch of the jewellers @entity116 ’s — a favourite target — in @entity200 in 2008 , they smashed their way into the glazed front of the shop in two limousines , before making off with jewellery worth £ 8million			2
and like any @entity83 criminals , the @entity6 like their disguises			1
in 2008 , they dressed up as women for an attack on jeweller ’s @entity291 in @entity293			0
they wore blonde wigs , sunglasses and fashionable scarves — but carried concealed hand grenades and @entity299 guns			0
they left with emeralds , rubies and diamonds worth nearly £ 70 million			2
for a 2009 raid on @entity116 ’s in @entity305 , it is thought they used the latest in prosthetic make - up			0
this time they got away with £ 40million of jewels			1
it would be utterly wrong to romanticise the @entity6 , who are known for their ruthless pursuit of wealth , carrying out raids armed with @entity314 but it would be utterly wrong to romanticise the @entity6 , who are known for their ruthless pursuit of wealth , carrying out raids armed with kalashnikovs			2
in 2005 , a shop assistant at a jeweller 's in @entity321 was shot in the face during a robbery attributed to the @entity6			1
rarely are the jewels recovered			0
necklaces , tiaras and bracelets are broken up , their gold or platinum settings melted down , and individual gems sold in plain sight on the international diamond market			0
arresting the perpetrators has proved easier than tracking down the stolen jewels			0
and the burglaries continue despite the arrests			0
in 2007 , three gang members were convicted of taking part in @entity340 ’s biggest ever jewel robbery , when £ 15million in merchandise was stolen , including the @entity343 necklace of 116 diamonds , with its centrepiece 125 - carat diamond			1
three more @entity6 were convicted in 2008 for robberies across @entity222			2
others have been arrested in @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 and @entity352 , where three @entity353 were spotted in march 2012 casing a jewellery shop , disguised with wigs			0
one of them has already escaped from @entity352 prison			0
but the organisation is seemingly unstoppable			0
cut off one head of this hydra - like gang and another two or three grow in its place			0
for anxious jewellers , keeping an eye on their diamond necklaces , the terrifying truth is that there are so many @entity6 , and they are so adept at breaking out of jail , that even a whole pack of inspector @entity371 — however accidentally brilliant — could never hope to round them all up .			2
