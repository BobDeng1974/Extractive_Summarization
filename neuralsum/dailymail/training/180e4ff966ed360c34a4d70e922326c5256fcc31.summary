by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 06:59 est , 23 november 2013 a @entity2 's head stuffed with fruit was usually the main dish at any feast when @entity6 entertained guests , especially during the festive period			1
and now centuries later it looks like the dish could make a @entity11 comeback as a challenger to the traditional turkey as the price of the meat continues to soar			1
one of the champion 's of the dish is @entity18 , the head chef of the @entity19 in @entity20			1
revival : could pig 's head take the place of turkey at this year 's @entity11 table ? the economic delicacy costs £ 5 against £ 60 for a free - range turkey his delicacy costs £ 5 against roughly £ 60 for a free - range turkey - the face provides the meat and the pork - infused wine can be served as savoury pre-dinner cocktail			1
' @entity37 can be a pain to cook , ' mr @entity18 told the @entity39			0
' you need two packs of butter and a litre of gravy to make sure it 's not too dry			1
plus you lose your morning to cooking when you could be getting tipsy on mulled swine			0
' blast from the past : king @entity6 often hosted elaorate dinner parties which would have featured a pig 's head ' people have realised that turkey is n't necessarily the most delicious thing to have at @entity11 , ' said @entity54 , in a break from being mobbed for autographs and photos			1
' even if you are a tradition addict , if you are a keen cook you will want to surround the festivities with more up - to - the - minute and exciting food			0

although a pig 's head with a glistening snout sitting in the middle of a family table is not for the sensitive , it may be welcomed by some watching their purse strings as a typical large frozen turkey , enough to feed more than ten people and leave some over for sandwiches , will be around £ 3 more expensive at £ 20			1
however , people buying fresh from a butcher will probably be paying at least £ 60 – and potentially much more - for a bird of that size			0
at the same time other key essentials for the feast , such as potatoes , carrots , peas and , of course , sprouts , are also more expensive			0
the latest official figures from @entity90 market suggest the price of turkey is up by some eight per cent in the past year			1
at the same time , the @entity93 claims a smaller increase of six per cent			0
however , a snapshot survey conducted this weekend found a the price of a large frozen turkey in supermarkets was up by some 17 per cent in a year			1
research by @entity99 last year put the price of a frozen turkey weighing 5 - 6kg at £ 17 , however this year it is around £ 20 , @entity102 is currently charging £ 20 and @entity103 ’s £ 22 for a bird weighing 5.3 - 6.9kg , while @entity105 is charging £ 20 for a 5.8kg bird			1
changing times : @entity37 has been the main dish of @entity11 meals for decades , but could it now be replaced with turkey ? the other @entity11 dinner essential , @entity113 sprouts , are up by some 19per cent this year - a rise from £ 2.10 a kilo to some £ 2.50 at the same time a 2.5kg pack of white roasting potatoes is up by some 15per cent to £ 2			1
the increases for carrots and peas are smaller			0
smoked salmon and stilton are now as much a part of @entity11 as the turkey			1
the survey found that @entity126 is up by around 5 per cent to £ 2.32 for just 100g , while smoked salmon is up by some 28 per cent to £ 4 for a 100g pack			0
@entity129 , chairman of the @entity93 , said : ‘ massive fluctuations in the price of feed affects the price of a turkey but people will still ' trade up ' at @entity11 by getting the best they can afford			1
this year you 'll be paying around £ 53 for a 4kg turkey			2
