by @entity0 published : 18:57 est , 14 july 2013 updated : 03:18 est , 15 july 2013 when it comes to beauty products , bitter experience has taught me that price frequently has little to do with effectiveness			1
in fact , many of my cut - price buys from @entity11 chemists and supermarkets have outperformed ' cult ' brands that seem to deliver nothing more than pseudo-scientific credentials at inflated prices			0
so when i heard this month that a cream costing just £ 1.69 was taking the beauty industry by storm , i was n't at all surprised			1
' genius on dry skin ' : @entity22 has suddenly shot to the top of every beauty must - have list - and for good reason once only available in @entity27 and @entity29 shops and salons , a cocoa butter body cream called @entity32 has suddenly shot to the top of every beauty must - have list			1
everyone from the beauty bloggers to the @entity37 is falling over themselves to give an opinion ( good , on the whole ) while the product is now widely available online - though at significantly hiked - up prices			1
' it 's genius on dry skin - you have to try it ! ' enthused my beauty addict friend @entity48 , whipping a bottle from her shoulder bag in the middle of a recent barbecue			1
observing @entity48 's dewy and entirely scale - free limbs , the assembled women eagerly began slathering the stuff on to knees , elbows , shins and any children who strayed into range			1
' looks industrial , ' observed my bemused husband - a fair point given that the packaging is definitely not one of the product 's strong points			1
there 's the name for starters : ' @entity32 ' sounds less like a pampering treat than a prop from @entity72			1
then there 's the bottle 's challenging colour - reminiscent of something treated in @entity77			1
but @entity48 would not be silenced on the subject			0
the cream is n't sticky , she promised , and does n't smell sickly like some cocoa butter creams do			0
it 's rich ( the product contains lanolin as well as cocoa butter ) and would therefore be perfect to use on weather - dried skin ( i 'm a runner and regularly suffer from rain and wind - chapping )			1
@entity88 : while the stuff takes a long time to sink into skin , once it does , it will give your epidermis a lovely , glossy sheen @entity48 also advised i try using it on the children 's skin as an antidote to the irritation caused by chlorinated water in swimming pools			1
i was convinced enough to go in search of my own supply			0
@entity48 , after all , knows what she 's talking about when it comes to cult products			1
she 's the first person i can recall using @entity108 back in the early @entity109 and she has n't put an immaculate foot wrong since			1
i could have had my @entity111 delivered to my front door the following day had i ordered it online			0
numerous suppliers have cottoned on to the product 's mounting popularity and are selling @entity32 for around £ 7 with a further £ 10 added for quick delivery			2
but being a sucker for a beauty bargain , i decided to try and hunt it down for myself amongst my local @entity121 beauty salons			2
it turns out , however , that while @entity22 might be developing a cult online following , this has n't yet translated into extra piles of stock in the shops			1
the girl in the local mini mart kept directing me towards the @entity130 while the nice lady in the chemist next door was n't selling it , but told me she had been given a bottle by her sister			0
after some intensive detective work , i eventually received word that @entity32 was being sold in a beauty salon on a side street off the main road			2
feeling like skincare 's answer to @entity144 , i dashed to the address to discover a lone bottle on a back shelf , between the hair relaxers			2
and it was still only £ 1.69 ! ' very popular stuff that , ' smiled the woman behind the counter			0
' i 'm going to put the price up next week			0
that 's my last bottle but tell your friends there 's more coming soon			2
' i 'm not sure i want to let them in on the secret - because my search was more than worth it			0
the cream is extremely thick and rich and gives your skin a lovely , glossy sheen that - at least on me - seems to last all day			1
it 's a particularly welcome effect given that summer 's arrival means neglected heels , shins and decolletage must suddenly come out of hibernation			2
a word of warning , however : the stuff takes ages to sink in			0
i found myself rubbing it into my shins for about half an hour after my shower - so no good if you 're in a rush			0
and it would definitely be too pore - clogging to use on your face			0
in the two weeks since i 've begun using @entity111 several of my friends have commented on how good my skin looks			2
my husband has been caught using it as after - sun lotion and even my seven - year - old son will allow it to be applied after swimming on the grounds that it ' does n't smell like girls ' ( it does n't smell of anything much )			0
my @entity194 ( closer to £ 20 than £ 2 ) meanwhile , has started gathering dust			0
in fact so enamoured am i of my bargain beauty find that i 've even started to come round to the name			2
rather than masquerading as an ' intensive moisture delivery system ' or a ' 24 - hour nourishing complex ' the stuff just does what it says on the tin			0
and we know that particular marketing strategy has worked before now …			0

@entity22 is taking the beauty industry by storm
once only available in @entity29 shops , it 's now on everyone 's wish list
it 's super cheap and will leave your skin looking lovely
