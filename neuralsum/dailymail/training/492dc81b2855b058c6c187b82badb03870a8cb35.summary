click here for all the heat maps and statistics that matter in @entity4 's brilliant @entity3 there was a moment before kick - off when @entity8 let it be known to the officials that he thought @entity11 ’s goals were too big and a measuring tape was brought out			1
had he called for a bricklayer , it ’s unlikely that he would have improved the result			1
not with finishing as sharp as @entity16 ’s and moves as slick and quick as the two that made his goals			1
@entity16 finishes off his first goal to give @entity11 a 1 - 0 lead over @entity22 at the @entity23 @entity16 acknowledges team - mate @entity24 ( left ) after a slick interchange between the pair led to the opening goal @entity11 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity28 6 ; @entity29 7 , @entity30 6 , @entity31 7 , @entity32 6 ; @entity33 6 , @entity34 6.5 ; @entity35 6 ( @entity36 82 ) , @entity24 7.5 ( @entity37 58 , 6 ) , @entity38 7 ; @entity16 8 ( @entity39 82 ) subs not used : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 @entity22 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity45 5 ; @entity46 5 , @entity47 7 , @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 6.5 ; @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 ( @entity52 67 , 6 ) , @entity53 6 ( @entity54 67 , 6 ) , @entity55 6 ( @entity56 67 , 6 ) ; @entity57 5 , @entity58 5 subs not used : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 referee : @entity65 7 att : 20,259 @entity66 : @entity16 even with all the possession @entity22 managed — 51 per cent , which is no small achievement in these parts — they rarely looked like scoring			1
when @entity54 had an open goal in stoppage time , he hit the post			1
it ’s why @entity8 puffed out his cheeks as he considered a fourth game without victory since that remarkable toppling of @entity79 last month			1
it ’s why @entity81 afforded himself a big grin after a week of big statements and mild controversy			1
while the past six days had been spent absorbing the fallout of his claim that @entity90 ’s @entity89 cheated and his assertion that referees are not fair to @entity11 , this was merely a convincing win with no incident worth complaining about			1
‘ it ’s quite boring , ’ @entity81 joked			1
@entity8 was rather more subdued			2
‘ we did n’t perform as well as we should have done , ’ he said			2
‘ we did n’t manage the ball well enough			2
you can ill afford to make too many unforced errors			2
it made it a frustrating afternoon for the players			2
‘ the bottom line is our baseline performance has to be better			2
the work ethic we have has always been exceptionally good and here i did n’t feel we really gave as much as we could do to stay in the game			2
that is the biggest disappointment			2
’ and on the goal posts ? ‘ the goalkeepers felt they were a bit high ( in the warm - up ) , ’ @entity8 said			0
‘ i thought it was in everyone ’s best interest , bearing in mind the controversy @entity115 has had to deal with this week , to get it checked			0
it was quite light - hearted			0
’ the rest of his day was quite heavy going			0
his tactic appeared to be sit , stifle and ambush , and two thirds of the plan were occasionally effectively			0
but with no obvious proficiency for getting the ball from back to front , @entity22 spent most of the first half inviting pressure			0
diving @entity22 keeper @entity45 is given no chance as @entity16 's strike is put away clinically from the top of the box @entity16 laps up the adulation from @entity133 fans after his opening goal in their @entity136 clash with @entity22 on saturday the build up to @entity11 's first goal on @entity4 's @entity138 as @entity24 and @entity16 execute a one - two to perfection at the end @entity140 miles @entity11 111.1 69.0 @entity33 90 11.9 7.4 @entity29 90 11.2 6.9 @entity34 90 11.1 6.9 @entity22 114.4 71.1 @entity50 90 11.8 7.3 @entity57 90 11.8 7.3 @entity58 90 11.1 6.9 @entity11 took the lead in the 34th minute			1
the goal was a brilliant blur			0
@entity29 took possession on the right and fed a ball to @entity16 , whose backheel inside @entity48 found @entity24			1
the @entity148 forward returned a pass to @entity16 and the striker scored in his third successive match			1
now , @entity22 needed to attack and @entity11 needed to avoid giving away a lead for a third straight game			1
the @entity22 rush was instant and within two minutes of the second half they hit the bar , albeit directly from a @entity48 throw , so it would n’t have counted			0
in the 57th minute @entity16 got his second after another move dominated by the excellence of @entity24 and the finishing of the @entity163			1
@entity38 rolled the ball to @entity24 , who threaded a quite brilliant pass back to the winger			0
@entity38 squared and @entity16 notched his 20th career @entity136 goal			1
@entity81 concluded : ' it was about getting three points as we could feel that little bit of pressure on us within the crowd and amongst the players			0
' it was never going to be easy , especially when @entity22 threw caution to the wind , and we could have controlled the ball a bit better in the second half , but i thought we deserved it			0
' we limited them to shots from distance which is credit to the shape we 've been working on and how hard defensively we 've been working			0
' three goals we 've conceded in the last two games - two against @entity188 and the second one against @entity90 - has not been the standard we 've set but we got back to that to keep a clean sheet			0
' @entity38 ( right ) beat @entity192 ( left ) continuously down the left side with his immense pace @entity11 's @entity31 slides in to dispossess @entity22 's @entity58 as the @entity196 striker speeds down the right wing marshalling the left side of defence @entity31 clatters into @entity57 and the ball during @entity11 's win at home on saturday @entity203 , who rattled the crossbar from long - range , gives @entity22 's @entity50 a hard time at the @entity207 @entity50 fires a left - footed shot from inside the box in @entity22 's loss to now sixth - placed @entity11 @entity16 guides his second goal into the back of the net from close range to give @entity11 a comfortable 2 - 0 lead @entity16 shows an image on his shirt ( left ) after scoring @entity11 's first goal before doing a dance for the fans after slotting his second ( right ) @entity16 is replaced late in the match but there 's no handshake between the winning manager and his strike @entity34 nearly made it three with a 20 - yard drive against the bar and @entity49 went to ground to stop @entity35			1
the winger went down , @entity233 ’s arms went up , but no whistle , no controversy			0
‘ i am very pleased with the three points , a deserved win , ’ @entity81 said			0
‘ there was a little bit of pressure on us to get the win but i am very pleased to get two very well worked goals against a determined side			0

@entity16 scored in the 34th minute to give @entity11 the lead at the @entity23
the @entity163 striker *doubled* the *advantage* in the 57th minute with a tap in from close range
@entity11 move to sixth on the @entity136 table between @entity254 in fourth and @entity255 in seventh
