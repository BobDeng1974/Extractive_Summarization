the harlequin ladybird , which is now the second most common in the @entity14 , is eating other ladybirds - including the 2 - spot and 10 - spot - at such a rate , it has become one of the world ’s fastest spreading insects			1
since the harlequin was spotted in the @entity14 in 2004 it has bred with astonishing ferocity and there are currently more than a billion			2
hundreds of householders have reported plagues inside their homes			0
a new study is the first to use dna analysis to identify prey species in the guts of harlequins showing their ‘ damaging effect on native species			1
’ originally from @entity35 , the harlequin is larger and more voracious than native @entity8 ladybirds that have become part of its diet			1
although mainly an aphid predator , it is believed to be responsible for the decline of some other ladybirds through competition and cannibalism			1
in total , 177 larvae were collected from the wild in @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity53 before being tested			0
three of the four target prey species were detected in the guts of harlequins including the 10 - spot ladybird ( @entity58 ) found in 9.6 per cent , 2 - spot ( @entity59 ) in 2.8 per cent and marmalade hoverfly ( @entity61 ) , also in 2.8 per cent			1
the only insect tested for , and not detected , was the green lacewing ( @entity64 ) , said the study published in @entity66			2
in total , 177 larvae were collected from the wild in @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity53 and then tested			0
three of the four target prey species were detected in the guts of harlequins including the 10 - spot ladybird ( found in 9.6 per cent ) and the 2 - spot ( pictured ) at 2.8 per cent dr @entity73 , of @entity74 in @entity75 , said : ‘ this study shows harlequin ladybirds in the wild commonly prey on a number of insects other than just aphids			1

‘ the results offer further evidence the harlequin is a generalist predator which is having a damaging effect on native species across @entity11			2
‘ ladybirds and other aphid - feeding insects are a very important part of ecosystems - acting as natural pest controllers			0
' there are 47 ladybird species in the @entity14 - and it ’s vital this diversity is maintained			1
’ the 7 - spot ladybird - the classic red one with the black spots - is still @entity14 ’s most common species , and the harlequin has had little effect on this as their habitats rarely overlap			1
‘ but other species - such as the 5 - spot which is only found in @entity135 and one or two places in @entity137 - could be at risk of eventual extinction because there are relatively so few of them , ' adds dr @entity73			0
‘ there ’s not much we can do to stop the march of the harlequin - our only hope is spiders and some wasps that prey on ladybirds do a better job at catching them			0
we ’re in the hands of @entity153			0
’ in 2003 there were no harlequins in the @entity14 but now they have spread to all parts of the @entity157 and are proving deadly to those that cross it			2
it produces a noxious , foul - smelling chemical that can stain furniture and its bite can trigger an allergic reaction in humans			0
at around 0.3 inches ( 7.5 millimetres ) in diameter the harlequin is considerably bigger and more aggressive than most native types and will breed several times a year .			0
