by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 09:30 est , 30 march 2013 children have been banned from a town centre at night under sweeping new police plans to crack down on anti-social behaviour			1
police officers have been given the power to stop anyone under 16 from walking the streets in @entity9 , @entity10 , after 9pm , and to take them home if they are not with a parent or responsible adult			1
the six - month dispersal order - which police said was introduced in the wake of reports of rowdy and abusive behaviour in the town centre - has been branded ' totally wrong ' and a ' blatant infringement ' of civil liberties by critics			1
no children allowed : police in @entity24 can now stop children under 16 from walking around the town centre after 9pm the order , which came into force yesterday and covers the hours between 9pm and 6am , also gives police the power to disperse groups of two or more people from areas where there is persistent anti-social behaviour			1
any breach of a dispersal order , such as refusing to comply with being told to leave , is classed as a criminal offence			2
' abusive behaviour ' : police said @entity24 residents have complained of feeling ' harassed and intimidated ' campaigners have warned that the ban infringes on civil liberties and said it amounted to treating groups of young people as criminals			1
@entity48 , director of @entity49 , said a dispersal order was a ' blunt , crude tool ' that , at best , moves the problem to another location nearby			2
' it is a sign that the police have lost control of the streets and yet does nothing to restore either the community spirit or respect for the law that has been lost , ' he said			2
' it 's simple - if people break the law , harass people and cause distress then the police should arrest them			0
' the idea that simply by being under 16 and in town is grounds for the police to take you home seems a waste of time and resources			0
' to treat every group of young people as criminals is totally wrong and a blatant infringement on people 's rights to move around @entity24			1
' the campaign group @entity80 has said dispersal orders ' blur the distinction between nuisance and criminal behaviour '			0
inspector @entity85 , from @entity86 , said : ' over the past few months , we have received numerous reports of nuisance caused by large groups congregating in the town centre			0
' the @entity91 has reported a number of nuisance behaviour incidents within their premises , and the @entity96 car park has been a regular venue for nuisance drivers late at night			0
' many interventions have been put in place and although some measures have had some success , nuisance behaviour still persists on an almost daily basis			0
' the common theme that appears to cause the most concern is rowdy , inconsiderate and abusive behaviour , ' @entity105 added			1
' this is often from people in large groups and has led to members of the public and business community reporting the feeling of being harassed and intimidated			0
' the officer said discretion would be used and that the force wants to encourage residents and visitors to go into the town centre for retail and leisure			0
' by dispersing those groups intent on engaging in poor behaviour , we will ensure @entity24 is a safer and stronger town for everyone else , ' she said .			2
