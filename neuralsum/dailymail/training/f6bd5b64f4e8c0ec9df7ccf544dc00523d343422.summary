researchers say the economic cost of cancer reaches almost £ 100billion every year in @entity17 , with lung cancer battering the economy most overall			1
although the shocking costs can be attributed to healthcare systems used to treat the deadly disease , cancer also affects other areas of the economy including productivity lost through early death and time off work			1
@entity4 spends £ 3.9billion on healthcare costs - visits to doctors , inpatient stays and medication - and £ 5.5billion due to productivity losses			1
a further £ 1.9billion is due to informal care costs - the monetary value of leisure or work time friends and relatives give up to care for cancer patients			2
breast cancer had the highest healthcare costs - £ 4.8billion each year - accounting for 13 per cent of the total cancer healthcare costs in the @entity41			1
however , the highest total economic burden was attributable to lung cancer - a total of £ 15billion - with £ 8billion due to premature mortality			1
dr @entity46 , of @entity47 said : ‘ one of the purposes of studies such as this one is to enable comparisons to be made between the burden of different diseases , aiding decision makers to prioritise scarce research funds			0
‘ in order to be in a better position to inform policy decisions there is a great need for improved information on epidemiology , healthcare resource use and unit costs across the @entity41			2
’ highest cost : breast cancer had the highest healthcare costs - £ 4.8 billion each year - accounting for 13 per cent of the total cancer healthcare costs in the @entity41 professor @entity69 , president of the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , said : ‘ it is essential that the economic impact of cancer on a community is known , understood and placed in its perspective			1
‘ the greatest single economic cost was £ 4.8billion for breast cancer			2
this should be placed in the perspective that the economic cost of pneumonia in the @entity41 is £ 8billion each year			0
‘ the cost of cancer is not just the cost of drugs and hospital stays and this has been taken into account by @entity92			0
’ the lowest healthcare cost for cancer was £ 25 per year spent on healthcare for every person in @entity97 , while the highest was @entity98 at £ 131			1
dr @entity46 said the study enables better informed policy decisions dr @entity46 said : ‘ the countries with the highest per - capita costs in terms of cancer healthcare tend to be @entity108 and @entity109 countries			2
‘ those with the lowest per - capita costs tend to be member states who joined the @entity41 in 2004 and have lower national income levels			0
’ researchers from pharmaceutical company @entity116 in the @entity117 , collected data from the 2010 and 2011 @entity41 national health and wellness surveys on 105,581 adults			0

dr @entity137 - presenting the findings alongside dr @entity46 at the @entity139 of the @entity140 in @entity141 - said : ‘ this study underscores the importance of recognising caregiver burden , not just because of the direct implications for the well - being and quality of care of the patient with cancer , but also due to the extra burden it brings to society overall			0
’ prof @entity69 said : ‘ the remarkable study of dr @entity137 and colleagues provides unique information on the impact of cancer on care - givers			0
this again is key information and is almost unique			0
‘ these studies provide a background on which logical funding decisions can be made			1

the economic burden of cancer costs almost £ 100billion every year in @entity17
@entity4 spends £ 3.9billion on healthcare costs and £ 5.5billion on productivity losses
studies such as this provide background to logical funding decisions
