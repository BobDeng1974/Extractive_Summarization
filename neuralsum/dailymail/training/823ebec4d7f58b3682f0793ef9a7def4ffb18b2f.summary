by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 blood smeared across his face from his nose to his left ear , it was a fitting image to mark @entity9 ’s last game for @entity10			1
this is one warrior who was always likely to go out on his shield			0
the flailing arm from @entity16 ’s @entity15 was far from the first time @entity9 has taken one for the team , nor will it be the last as he changes colours and heads for @entity20 after more than eight years at @entity21			1
in a country known for tough defenders , @entity22 is about to inherit one of the toughest			0
brave : @entity9 fittingly bowed out with a bloodied nose after @entity10 's draw at @entity16 @entity10 have had their fair share of them down the years : think @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
the @entity34 has raised the bar even higher			2
‘ he puts his head where people are scared to put their feet , ’ said teammate @entity36 after @entity9 played his last game at @entity21			1
he wants to die for the cause , in a good way			0
he is very brave , a great player and he ’s won everything at @entity10			2
’ from the moment @entity9 arrived for £ 7million in the 2006 january transfer window , the first signing of the @entity49 era , it was clear that @entity10 had found themselves a true leader – someone who had captained @entity52 to the @entity34 title at a young age before enhancing his fearsome reputation at @entity56			1
flying high : @entity9 chipped in with more than his fair share of goals for @entity10 over the years there were childhood tales of growing up in @entity61 , a town one hundred miles from @entity62 that was targeted for @entity64 and @entity65 bombing raids			1
united fans embraced the legend , even though heir tribute song to @entity9 might not be the most politically correct in @entity70 football			2
back then : @entity9 joined @entity10 in january 2006 , signed by sir @entity71 it was sung in full cry last tuesday when @entity9 made his farewell appearance at @entity21 against @entity75 before taking the microphone to say his goodbyes on the pitch afterwards and thank them ‘ from the bottom of my heart ’			1
in the match programme that night , he tried to play down the importance of him leaving @entity10			2
‘ it should n’t be so dramatic , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ a lot of players leave the club and a lot come here			0
@entity10 will always be the same and will always attract good , big - name players			2
i do n’t think it will be any different when the transfer market starts			0
‘ last year @entity91 retired			0
before that , it was @entity94			0
that ’s life and yet you still see these players around the club and supporting the club			0
i will be no different			0
’ history will show his contribution to be rather more significant , however			0
it is hard to think of a better central defensive partnership in the @entity102 era than that forged by @entity9 and @entity104			1
it saw the @entity34 win the title in five of the eight full seasons that he played at @entity21 , not to mention a @entity110 , @entity111 and three @entity109			1
@entity9 was the proverbial rock at the heart of defence , while @entity104 was the ball player			2
it felt like the perfect combination			0
very few players got the better of @entity9 , even though @entity10 fans were right to get nervous every time he came up against @entity119 , and @entity120 and then @entity121 in particular			1
double act : @entity9 joined alongside @entity123 - both have enjoyed good careers at the club he was a gladiator , fearsome and fearless in equal measure			1
images of @entity9 holding his head after another juddering collision while a physio sponged the blood of his face or asked him to count the fingers in front of his eyes like a punch - drunk boxer will live on			0
some believe that he was never quite the same after badly damaging the ligaments in his right knee during a @entity110 game against @entity143 in december 2011 , but @entity9 soldiered on			1
saturday ’s final appearance at @entity145 was his 300th for @entity10			1
only 10 of those have come off the bench			0
his leaving present was an elbow to the nose from @entity15			1
@entity9 would n’t have it any other way			0
head where it hurts : a bloodied @entity9 leaves the field for treatment on sunday			0

@entity34 played his final game for @entity10 against @entity16
defender was left with a bloody nose after being caught by @entity15
he joined @entity10 for £ 7million in 2006 and has made his mark as one of the toughest and bravest the @entity102 has seen
@entity9 will move to @entity20 this *summer* after eight years at @entity21
