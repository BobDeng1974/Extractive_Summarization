@entity2 's contributions to the @entity3 have quadrupled to £ 11.3 billion in just five years , official figures revealed this morning			1
it means each family in the @entity2 now sends £ 450 a year to @entity6 on average – up £ 350 from the £ 100 bill in 2008 – according to the @entity10 figures			1
the soaring bill comes before the latest demand for an extra £ 1.7billion , which @entity13 has refused to pay by the december 1 deadline			1
the @entity10 said @entity2 spent £ 11.3 billion more than it got back in 2013 today 's revelation comes less than 24 hours after @entity18 analysis emerged suggesting the @entity19 had expected @entity2 's @entity6 contributions would be £ 8.6billion in 2013 – some £ 2.7billion less than the real cost			1
the increase in @entity2 's contributions is because @entity2 's economy has grown more quickly than other @entity3 countries			2
the net contributions include the @entity2 's annual rebate , which increased from £ 3.1billion in 2012 to £ 3.7billion in 2013			1
in 2008 the @entity2 paid £ 2.7 billion to @entity6 - rising to £ 3.8 billion in 2009 , £ 7.2 billion in 2010 , £ 7.5 billion in 2011 , £ 8.5 billion in 2012 and £ 11.3 billion in 2013			1
in its report on the @entity2 's balance of payments , the @entity10 said : ' in 2013 , the @entity2 made a net contribution to the @entity3 of £ 11.3 billion			1
this was an increase of £ 2.7 billion from the net contribution of £ 8.5 billion paid in 2012			0
' the increase was mainly due to the £ 3 billion increase in the @entity2 's total gross national income ( @entity38 ) contribution			2
' the @entity38 contribution is calculated based on the @entity2 's estimate of economic activity within a budget year relative to other @entity3 countries and can increase and decrease from one year to the next			2
' the @entity2 , like other countries , receives a rebate on its contributions to the @entity3 , and similarly to its @entity38 contribution , it can increase and decrease from one year to the next			1
' in 2013 , the rebate paid to the @entity2 increased £ 0.6 billion to £ 3.7 billion , from £ 3.1 billion in 2012			1
' @entity3 leaders : new foreign policy chief @entity49 ( left ) , the outgoing @entity51 boss @entity50 ( centre left ) and @entity53 ( centre right ) , who is being replaced by @entity55 ( right ) as @entity57 president in the wake of the row over the £ 1.7billion bill , there has been a sharp rise in support for leaving the @entity3 , according to a new poll by @entity65 the figures do not include the extra £ 1.7 billion demanded by the @entity3 , which followed a reassessment of national incomes carried out by statistics authorities in each of the 28 member states , and led to large demands for extra money from @entity2 , the @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , while countries including @entity77 and @entity78 stand to gain to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros			1
the prime minister has insisted he will not hand over ' anything like ' the £ 1.7 billion demanded by the @entity57 , and @entity83 said the @entity2 ' ca n't and wo n't pay ' by the deadline			0
the @entity2 government has been stunned by the demand , which emerged a week ago			0
the @entity57 used rules dating back to 1995 and found @entity2 's economy has grown faster than expected , so must pay a greater share to @entity6			2
to add insult to injury , @entity77 will receive a £ 790million rebate because its economy is struggling			0
however , payments dating back to 2007 show how the payments to the @entity97 project have been quietly rising			0
a major cause has been @entity100 's decision to agree to a 7 per cut in the rebate during negotiations on the last seven - year budget deal			0
it cost @entity2 £ 7billion over seven years			0
@entity105 famously secured the rebate in 1984 by banging the table and demanding ' our own money back ' during a summit with @entity97 leaders in @entity112 , in @entity77			1
new figures reveal the increased bill the @entity2 faces , on top of the £ 11.3billion - a - year it already pays , is higher than any other @entity3 country , because its economy has been growing faster than expected			1
@entity77 , @entity78 and @entity118 are among those told they will get money back from @entity6 however , the rebate has fallen from £ 5.4billion in 2009 to only £ 3.7billion in 2013			1
@entity124 leader @entity123 told @entity125 : ' thank you mr @entity100 for sacrificing a large chunk of the @entity2 rebate in return for absolutely nothing			1
' much of the money that has come back to @entity2 has been used to make rich landowners richer ( through the @entity133 )			0
' the question is no longer can we afford to leave , it is can we afford to stay			0
' @entity137 , chief executive of @entity138 , which is campaigning for fundamental reform of the @entity3 , said : ' despite @entity13 securing a historic @entity3 budget cut , the cost of the @entity3 to @entity2 taxpayers continues to spiral out of control			2
' we can not continue to write bigger and bigger cheques to remain a member of an unreformed and uncompetitive @entity3			0
business is struggling under mounds of @entity3 red tape and the @entity2 economy is threatened by yet another potential eurozone recession			2
' we must secure a new deal from @entity6 and that will only be possible through a referendum			0
' a new poll released yesterday showed there had been a sharp shift in public opinion about the @entity159 in the wake of the latest demand for more money			0
@entity65 found a week ago that only 40 per cent of people would vote to leave the @entity3 , with 41 per cent wanting to stay			0
but now 44 per cent say they would leave , with only 35 per cent wanting to stay			0
@entity83 travelled to @entity165 today for talks with the @entity77 prime minister to seek support for renegotiating the @entity3 's demand for £ 1.7 billion in additional funding .			2

@entity2 handed over £ 11.3billion in 2013 up from £ 2.7billion in 2008 , says @entity10
@entity173 even more than @entity18 forecast of £ 8.6billion published yesterday
biggest cause of rise was @entity100 sacrificing part of @entity3 rebate
@entity105 secured rebate in 1984 by banging on the table
comes as @entity6 demands an extra £ 1.7billion by december 1
@entity186 rise in support for leaving the @entity3 after row over shock bill
