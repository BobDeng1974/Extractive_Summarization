by @entity1 reporter published : 11:36 est , 29 september 2012 updated : 11:36 est , 29 september 2012 millions of pounds of unexploded bombs dumped in the @entity3 by the @entity5 government after @entity6 pose a significant risk to offshore oil drilling , warn researchers			1
it is no secret that the @entity5 , along with other governments , dumped munitions and chemical weapons in oceans from 1946 until the practice was banned in the 1970s by @entity5 law and international treaty , said @entity18 , a @entity20 professor of oceanography			2
as technological advances allow oil companies to push deeper into the waters of the @entity3 , these forgotten hazards pose a threat as the industry picks up the pace of drilling after @entity31 's deadly @entity30 well blowout in 2010 that lead to the largest oil spill in @entity5 history			1
the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) will auction 38 million acres of oil and gas leases in the central gulf in march			2
the @entity5 government designated disposal areas for unexploded ordnance , known as @entity60 , off the @entity62 and @entity63 coasts , as well as in the @entity3			2
but nearly 70 years after the areas were created , no one knows exactly how much was dumped , or where the weapons are , or whether they present a danger to humans or marine life			1
' these bombs are a threat today and no one knows how to deal with the situation , ' said @entity18			0
' if chemical agents are leaking from some of them , that 's a real problem			2
if many of them are still capable of exploding , that 's another big problem			0
' disposal zones were designated from @entity84 to @entity85 , said @entity18 , who will discuss his research findings at the @entity87 on @entity89 conference that begins monday in @entity90 , @entity91			2
unexploded bomb : reseachers from @entity20 have found this 500 - pound device expert : oceanographer @entity96 says the oil and gas industries need to realize that these unexploded devices are a serious threat while the practice of dumping bombs and chemical weapons , including mustard and nerve gas , in the ocean ended 40 years ago some effects are just beginning to be seen , said @entity107 , founder of the underwater munitions conference			1
' you can find munitions in basically every ocean around the world , every major sea , lake and river , ' @entity107 said			0
' they are a threat to human health and the environment			0
' the oil industry is no stranger to leftovers from the @entity6			1
last year , @entity31 shut its key @entity124 crude pipeline in the @entity125 for five days while it removed a 13 - foot ( 4 - metre ) unexploded @entity44 mine found resting cozily next to the pipeline that transports up to 40 percent of the @entity129 's oil production			1
@entity31 discovered the mine during a routine pipeline inspection , then spent several months devising a plan to lift the bomb and move it far enough from the pipeline to safely detonate it			0
in the @entity3 , which accounts for 23 percent of @entity5 oil production and seven percent of domestic natural gas output , the hazards are known , but generally ignored			1
in 2001 , @entity31 and @entity45 found the wreckage of the @entity138 , a @entity44 @entity6 submarine , 45 miles from the mouth of the @entity42 during an underwater survey for a pipeline needed to transport natural gas to shore			1
@entity18 said he and colleague @entity144 have documented discarded bombs and leaking barrels over the past 20 years while conducting research for energy companies in the @entity3			2
records of where these munitions were dumped are incomplete and experts believe many dangerous cargoes were ' short - dumped , ' or discarded outside designated zones			0
@entity18 said he has come across 500 - pound ( 227 - kgs ) bombs about 60 miles off the @entity85 coast and other ordnance 100 miles offshore , outside designated zones			1
at least one @entity3 pipeline was laid across a chemical weapon dump site south of the mouth of the @entity42 , he said			1
while the risk of an underwater bomb exploding may be small , environmental damage from chemical weapons , such as mustard gas , is worrisome and needs to be researched , @entity18 said			0
' we would like to do a survey to be able to say if ( this material ) is harmful or not , ' he said			0
' the condition of these barrels is deteriorating , so does it affect anything or not ? we ought to know			0
' the experts claims that these forgotten bombs pose a threat just as the oil industry picks up the pace of drilling after @entity31 's deadly @entity30 well blowout in 2010 information does exist that charts some of the munitions dumpsites in the @entity3 calls and emails to various companies with wells or pipelines in the gulf seeking comment were not returned			1
neither the @entity189 , nor the @entity52 would comment as well			0
sonar data from a routine seabed survey performed by @entity192 identified munitions in about 3,000 feet of water near a proposed project , according to a paper presented at the 2007 @entity197			0
after determining the bombs presented a low - to - moderate risk , the project continued as planned			0
the oil and gas industry needs to do more address the problem , @entity107 said			1
' it makes more sense to start dealing with the munitions from a risk - mitigation standpoint to be able to conduct operations in those areas rather than trying to avoid that they are there , ' @entity107 said			0
the @entity52 , which regulates offshore drilling in federal waters , warns companies seeking leases to drill or add pipelines about the existence of unexploded ordnance and requires underwater surveys to assess and manage the numerous natural and man - made hazards			0

after @entity6 unexploded bombs were dumped in the ocean
70 years later no one knows exactly how many were dumped and where
500 - pound bombs found 60 miles off @entity85 coast
at least one @entity3 pipeline laid across a chemical weapon dump
call for oil and gas industry to do more to address the problem
