by @entity0 published : 08:39 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 20:25 est , 10 july 2013 with quite so many bundles of joy all lined up together , a bonny baby contest will inevitably involve the odd tantrum			1
in the @entity7 town of @entity8 , however , it ’s not the toddlers who are throwing their toys out of the pram – it ’s the grown - ups			0
the annual event has provoked a row after carnival organisers cancelled it for being ‘ unfair ’ to the children deemed less than bonny			1
last year 's winners : organisers of @entity20 , in @entity7 , have ruled the ' bonny baby ' contest is ' no longer an appropriate item ' for the event			1
pictured are last year 's winners but they reckoned without the mothers of @entity8 , who have accused the committee of excessive ‘ political correctness ’ – and launched their own unofficial bonny baby contest			1
@entity29 , 28 , is the mother of one of last year ’s winners , @entity32			0
she said : ‘ it ’s a bit of fun and everybody likes looking at pictures of babies			0
’ support : the alternative pageant has won the backing of @entity8 mayor @entity41 ( pictured ) , who said the event brings the community together but @entity44 , of @entity45 , which organises the carnival , said : ‘ it ’s a really modern carnival with hundreds of people taking part			2
‘ do you really think it is a good idea to judge babies and decide which ones are the best ? ' we are a community arts organisation and it is not really appropriate			0
‘ it just does n’t seem a very nice thing to do			0
everyone believes that their baby is the best baby			2
' how do you feel if your baby is n’t the one that has won ? ’ organisers have also abolished the role of @entity66 this year as it does not ‘ fit with the ethos ’ of the event			1
the carnival procession will be held on august 31 , with an unofficial ‘ mayor ’s @entity70 ’ four days beforehand			2
the alternative event has been organised by the former chairman of @entity20 , @entity73 , and endorsed by mayor @entity74			1
he said : ‘ the committee are doing a good job , but people like the old - fashioned stuff			0
‘ they like to take their kids along and say “ @entity80 did this when she was a little girl ”			0
‘ the mums said it was political correctness gone mad and i agree – it ’s absolutely stupid			0
’ @entity8 : committee members have also abolished the role of @entity66 as it does not ' fit with the ethos ' of the event ( picture shows general view of @entity8 )			1

organisers of @entity20 ruled baby pageant ' no longer appropriate '
committee members were *unanimously* against the pageant
some mothers have now organised their own ' unofficial ' contest
