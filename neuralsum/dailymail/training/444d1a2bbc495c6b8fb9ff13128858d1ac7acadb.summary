by @entity0 published : 22:42 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 14:17 est , 1 april 2013 the @entity1 has sent f - 22 stealth fighter jets to join @entity4 military exercises in a show of support for @entity7 as it urged @entity8 to restrain itself from making threats against the @entity4 and its allies			1
yesterday , the @entity8 's top decision - making body said nuclear weapons are ' treasure ' and the ' nation 's life ' and will not be traded for billions of dollars , the latest in a series of provocative statements from the rogue state			1
' [ @entity8 ] will achieve nothing by threats or provocations , which will only further isolate @entity8 and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in north - east @entity25 , ' the @entity1 said in a statement			2
' peace in @entity25 , above all on the @entity38 : may disagreements be overcome and a renewed spirit of reconciliation grow , ' he said			0
after the @entity8 's young leader @entity28 chaired his first plenary meeting of the ruling worker 's party central committee yesterday , a statement to the official @entity53 news agency said the country 's nuclear weapons ' are neither a political bargaining chip nor a thing for economic dealings to be presented to the place of dialogue or be put on the table of negotiations aimed at forcing [ @entity67 ] to disarm itself '			0
on saturday , @entity8 said it was entering a ' state of war ' with @entity4 but the statement was played down by @entity7 and the @entity1 as the latest piece of ' tough talk ' from @entity67			1
tensions have been high on the @entity38 since @entity28 ordered its third nuclear weapons test in february , breaching @entity74 sanctions and ignoring warnings from @entity76 , its closest ally , not to do so			0
the test drew further @entity74 and bilateral sanctions designed to pressure @entity8 to stop its nuclear weapons program			0
instead , @entity67 has responded with a campaign of threats , including a vow to launch nuclear weapons at the @entity1 , and a series of warnings			0
pope @entity41 called for a diplomatic solution to tensions in the @entity38 in his @entity43 address yesterday an unknown number of radar - evading @entity91 were deployed to @entity92 , the main @entity1 air force base in @entity4 , from @entity93 to take part in the annual joint @entity96 military drills , which prepare the allies to defend the @entity4 from a @entity8 attack			1
on thursday , the @entity1 performed a rare show of force aimed at the @entity8 by dropping dummy munitions from two @entity102 stealth bombers on practice runs over @entity4 , which led to @entity28 putting the @entity106 's missile units on standby to attack @entity1 military bases in the @entity4 and the @entity108			1
the two @entity109 have been in a state of war since the truce that ended their 1950 - 53 conflict			0
despite the threats from the @entity8 , few believe @entity67 will risk near - certain defeat by restarting a full - scale war			2
on saturday , @entity8 declared it was entering a ' state of war ' with the @entity4 analysts say the threats are more likely to be efforts to provoke softer policies toward @entity67 from a new government in @entity7 , to win diplomatic talks with @entity125 that could get more aid for the @entity8 and to strengthen the young @entity8 leader 's image and military credentials at home			1
@entity93 's top government spokesman @entity131 condemned @entity8 for ' aggressive provocation ' after @entity28 's ruling party newspaper , the @entity133 , identified @entity1 military bases in @entity93 as targets for attack			2
@entity67 justifies its own nuclear pursuits largely on a perceived threat from the @entity1			0
the @entity140 says the @entity1 is taking @entity8 's threats seriously , but has also noted @entity67 's history of ' bellicose rhetoric ' .			2

the @entity1 urges @entity8 to restrain itself from *threatening* the @entity4
