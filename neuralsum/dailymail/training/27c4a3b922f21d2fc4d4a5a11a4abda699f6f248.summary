' psychology in the bathroom ' lifts the lid on loo behaviour a new psychology book lifts the lid on the most natural of human behaviours , yet one of the the least explored – excretion			1
yes , you read that right			0
the act of going to the loo may well often be the butt of a joke ( sorry ! ) but there 's a much more serious side , linked to our psychology , do n't you know ? citing studies , facts , figures and theories , ' psychology in the bathroom ' enlightens readers on all areas of toilet - related behavior , including flatulence , incontinence and constipation			1
despite its humorous tone , the book tackles this most taboo of topics from a serious scientific standpoint			1
is constipation associated with particular kinds of personality ? why do we feel shame and disgust about our toilet habits ? these are just a few of life ’s dirtiest questions the book attempts to answer			1
written by professor @entity47 , the head of the school of psychology at the @entity50 , ' psychology in the bathroom ( £ 19.99 @entity53 ) also investigates cubicle graffiti , toilet - related swearing and erotic urination			1
in the chapter dedicated to breaking wind , the author writes , ' psychologists have paid little attention to the ludic aspects of flatulence			2
' the study into the breaking of wind presented college students with a description of hypothetical wind situations and asked the students to judge them on how polite , malicious and humorous they were			0
the study found that wind was deemed most polite when accidental , silent , odourless and among acquaintances , and most malicious and obnoxious when deliberate , loud rank and in the presence of strangers			0
the book tackles a taboo in today 's society : flatulence ' interestingly , the farts are most humorous when they are halfway between politeness and obnoxiousness - odourless and in the presence of acquaintance but also loud and deliberate			1
they are potentially embarrassing but not outright shameful , ' @entity47 writes			1
did the college students really need a team of psychologists to come to that conclusion ? possibly not			0
in another chapter called ' the @entity93 ' the author investigates the famous @entity96 theory that typical ' anal ' characteristics ( orderliness , obstinacy and prudence ) really are linked to ' concern with defecation '			0
in other words , do people with uptight personalities also have an aversion to poo ? the book describes several studies that have explored whether this link really exists			2
in one such experiment by @entity112 in 1966 , participants had to try to identify metal objects at the bottom of a tank using just their sense of touch			0
in order to feel the objects , the participants had to plunge their arms elbow - deep into the tank , which was filled either with water or a ' faecal - like stimulus '			2
( the scientists created a thick smelly mixture using crankcase oil and flour			0
) psychology in the bathroom : it 's a smelly topic but someone has to deal with it sure enough , on the task that involved the poo - like mixture , people who had anal characteristics performed worse than other participants			1
on the task that only involved water there was no difference in performance			0
this led the study 's authors to conclude that @entity146 was right - people with an ' anally retentive ' personality really do have an aversion to poo			2
hmm , we 're not so sure			0
@entity47 also explores the human swearing habit			1
did you know that has links to toilet habits too ? according to one study of swearing in 25 languages , faeces is by far the most common theme , with ' arseh * # e ' , ' fa * t ' , ' pr * t ' , ' sh * t ' and ' turd ' the most commonly used expletives			2
sodomy - themed words came a close second , with ' bugg * r ' and 's * d ' at the top of the list			0
the study also found that excrement and flatulence related swear words were used more frequently than urinary ones and that urinary words were also deemed less offensive			1
who knew scientists had dedicated so many grey cells to exploring such enlightening matters ?			0
