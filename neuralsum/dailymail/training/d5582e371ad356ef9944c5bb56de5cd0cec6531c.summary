‘ ( @entity29 ) attacked us , they had the choice			1

what was i meant to do , put my arms in the air and be cut to bits ? ’ this tuesday marks 30 years since the horrific @entity37 massacre , when two bikie gangs , the @entity22 and the @entity29 used guns , knifes , lead pipes and various other weapons to wreak havoc on a quiet suburb , invading a ‘ part swap ’ at @entity8 in @entity47 ’s south west			1
the case 's crucial witness , @entity48 , has come forward for the first time to tell her story – revealing the lasting trauma she experienced after witnessing the destruction of the bikie war			1
‘ it was just a family day that turned to hell , ’ ms @entity48 told 60 minutes			0
‘ there were so many children there			0
people were throwing children over the fence			2

she witnessed the scene unfold and provided the key witness account and only photographic evidence of the crime , which led to the conviction of 43 men			1
‘ the noise was incredible , not just the shots			0
there were people smashing each other with lead pipes , baseball bats , chains , anything			2
‘ people were screaming in agony			2
it all happened so quickly , you ’d blink and there ’d be three people lying in the middle of the carpark , ' said ms @entity48			2
after ms @entity48 ’s windscreen was shattered by a bullet , covering her in shards of glass , she fled for safety behind a caravan			0
it was at that moment that she had the ‘ clarity ’ of mind to grab her camera and , from beneath a van , take photographs of the barbaric scene – with the explicit purpose of exposing those responsible			0
‘ i thought , “ i ’m not going to let them get away with this ” ’ ‘ i tried to get photos of men with firearms still in their hands so i could later say , “ that man shot that man with that gun , ” ’ said ms @entity48			2
the brutal scene was something that ' noting could have prepared us for , ' according to senior constable @entity128 , who worked on the case and witnessed the shocking violence she took seven photos which were damning for the suspects , who underwent a 13 month trial – the longest in @entity136 history			1

@entity20 received a life sentence but served only 5 years 3 months , as his murder charge was downgraded to manslaughter and his sentence was shortened due to good behaviour			1
@entity128 is certain that @entity20 knew exactly what was going to unfold that fateful day , and believes the 71 - year - old grandfather has blood on his hands today			1

he still wears his gang colours			2
@entity20 returned to the scene of the massacre for the first time since the killings with the program			1
@entity20 insists that when he arrived at the fateful car park , he did not expect for any violence to erupt , despite he and his gang all arriving heavily armed to meet with their arch enemies ms @entity48 says she no longer lives in fear after spending 25 years ‘ looking over shoulder			1
’ she could not escape the horror of the bikie war , as bikies made threats on her life , leading to repeated moves and jobs changes , to remain inconspicuous			1
however , she knew she had no option but to expose the bikies ’ crimes and every detail she could possibly recount during the trial			0
she believes the victims have been forgotten as time has passed			2
‘ it was important to remember the innocent people that were out there			2
i think the victims have been lost in this , ’ ms @entity48 said			0
for @entity2 ’s father , @entity202 , his daughter will never be forgotten			0

mr @entity202 has been left with nothing , except the clothes his daughter was wearing on the day she was killed and the @entity37 present , a photo frame , that @entity2 had planned to give to @entity202 that day			0
thirty years later , his mind still wanders			0
looking at her clothes , he says ‘ i can imagine what she would have looked like that day			0
