by @entity0 published : 12:32 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 14:32 est , 24 april 2013 the country remains in the grip of an obesity crisis despite the reams of faddy new diets launched every week , so maybe we need to look at the history books to find the answer to our ever increasing waistlines ? a new @entity11 company hopes to help the nation slim back to health with a simple , old - fashioned gadget used by the ancient @entity15			1
so simple in fact that it looks just like a piece of string			0
unlike ordinary string the @entity19 claims it wo n't stretch , fray , rub , rot or retain water			1
it can be worn 24/7 worn around the middle , the polyester band provides a gentle reminder of when you 've had enough to eat			0
it provokes a state of constant awareness and motivation to eat less and more healthily			1
waist measurement is seen as a reliable indicator of general health and the @entity19 is designed to be a continuous reminder of how wide our waistline is			1
it ’s a centuries - old concept used by ancient civilisations for getting back in shape after childbirth or reducing the waistline			0
@entity15 , @entity44 and @entity45 were all fans			1
unlike ordinary string the @entity19 claims it wo n’t stretch , fray , rub , rot or retain water			1
it can be worn 24/7 as its fabric is washable and durable - meaning it does n't need to be removed for the shower			2
the band has a unique button - hole system where a round button goes through one of the button holes and the band lies at a comfortable tension around your middle , allowing it to be made smaller as you lose the inches			0
as your waist loses inches , the ‘ tail ’ becomes longer as you move the button up the button - holes to a smaller size			2
you can stop the inches creeping back on by continuing to wear the band after reaching your healthier target size			0
by wearing the band constantly , even after you 've reached your goal size , you will help retain your new shape a spokesperson said : ' the @entity19 is pretty and not something you would worry about anyone seeing under your clothing			2
but essentially , the band is a piece of cord - so if you ’re happy with a bit of string , then go right ahead ! it ’s the psychology of constant awareness which string could give just as well			1
' the band is not a magic potion - it simply motivates the wearer to eat more healthily , eat less , stand tall and hold their abs in and helps the wearer getting any bigger - it ’s a constant gauge of size			2
' some of our case studies wear the band having lost a great deal of weight through diet and exercise and are fearful of putting it back on			0
' the @entity19 puts them in control and does off with the need for calorie counting , food grouping or omission and an unhealthy relationship with a pair of bathroom scales			2
