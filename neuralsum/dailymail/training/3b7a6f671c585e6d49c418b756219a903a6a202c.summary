by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 21:32 est , 25 march 2013 police chiefs are wasting millions of pounds when buying basic kit because they can not agree on the details - such as how many pockets a uniform should have			1
the national spending watchdog found widespread disagreement between forces about what kind of high visibility jackets they prefer for their officers and how they like their handcuffs			1
as well as disagreeing on many pockets a police uniform needs , forces also hold opposing views about what constitutes a good boot			1
police chiefs are wasting millions as they ca n't agree on basic details of uniform such as handcuffs , boots and hi - vis jackets as a result of their lack of agreement , forces are not using their combined purchasing power to its greatest advantage , and some are spending much more than others on simple items , the @entity27 has concluded			1
in a report published today it reveals some forces are paying as much 400 per cent more than others for each high - visibility jacket			1
the highest price paid by a force was £ 100 per jacket , compared to a unit cost of just £ 20 in others			2
astonishingly , the report found 20 different specification differences between high - viz jackets			0
a spokesman for the @entity27 said these included whether it should be a heavy anorak or a lightweight cagoule , the levels of waterproofing and weight			0
@entity54 estimates that the force will have saved £ 110million by march 2012 through better procurement on handcuffs , forces differed on whether they preferred the steel finish or a black colour , and how the two cuffs should be linked together			1
some forces spent just £ 14 on a set of cuffs , compared to £ 43 in the most spendthrift constabulary			2
riot shields can be round , curved or long , interlocking and vary in weight and thickness			0
some forces prefer shields with map holders and dog handling straps			0
they cost between £ 31 and £ 136 depending on the force			0
body armour varied in areas such as thickness and colour and in price from £ 203 to £ 410			0
if forces could agree common standards on those five standard goods , they could save 25 per cent of their procurement budgets - or £ 1.6million a year , the report said			1
but coming in the way of agreement was that each piece of equipment had at least nine separate specifications			0
the report said : ‘ forces have found it particularly hard to agree common specifications for uniform , which they spent almost £ 8million on in 2010 - 11			1
the auditors added : ‘ if forces can not agree on such areas , meaningful collaboration will not be feasible			0
@entity101 mp , chair of the @entity102 , said : ‘ it is unbelievable that something as simple as a high - visibility jacket has 20 different specifications , with associated prices that differ by as much as £ 80			1
‘ instead of focusing money on tackling crime , police forces are wasting resources disagreeing over how many pockets they should have on their uniforms			2
' forces are facing cuts in @entity117 funding totalling £ 2.1 billion over the five years to 2015			2
together they spend £ 1.7billion on @entity120 equipment every year			0
the @entity27 said forces could save £ 2.6 million a year - up to a third of their uniform costs - by agreeing a common specification			1
chair of the @entity102 @entity101 said that it is unbelievable that there were so many differences between the forces @entity27 head @entity130 said : ‘ faced with the pressure to make substantial savings , it makes sense for police forces to examine the scope for cutting the cost of buying goods and services			0
‘ what is clear is that many opportunities for savings remain unexploited			0
‘ agreement between forces on collaborative ways of buying and common specifications for equipment can deliver better value for money - but implementing this is a challenge where forces are used to doing their own thing			2
policing and criminal justice minister @entity54 said : ‘ the @entity27 report recognises progress is being made			1
‘ the police are already required to buy vehicles , body armour and some it through national agreements and we estimate forces will have saved £ 110 million by march 2013 through better procurement			0

disagreed on basic things , such as how many pockets a uniform needs
some forces are paying 400 *%* more than others for a hi - vis jacket
forces differed on whether they wanted a steel or black finish on handcuffs
justice minister @entity54 estimates they will now save £ 110million
