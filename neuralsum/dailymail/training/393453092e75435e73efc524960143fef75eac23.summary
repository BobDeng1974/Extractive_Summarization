talks and sessions can be watched live on @entity2 's site the current prototype is a 5 - inch phone containing customised hardware and software designed to track the full @entity13 motion of the device , while simultaneously creating a map of the environment			1
these sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3d measurements every second , updating it ’s position and orientation in real - time			0
it then combines that data into a single 3d model of the space around the user			0
the technology could be used to capture the dimensions of a person 's home simply by walking around the table			0
directions to a new location could continue beyond a street address into a building that had been mapped by someone else			0
@entity59 could also be used by the visually - impaired to navigated unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places			2
or , when shopping , the tablet could be used to find the exact shelf a project is located on			0
@entity2 also highlights some of the gaming aspects , such as playing hide - and - seek with a virtual character			2
@entity1 ( which stands for input / output and ‘ innovation in the open ’ ) is an annual developer - focused conference run by @entity2 that reveals insights into the tech giant ’s research and development			1
previous conferences have seen significant new announcements such as @entity28 and the @entity17 tablet , as well as upgrades to existing services like @entity77			2
this year is expected to be no different - although there ’s no place this time around for @entity80 at any of the talks over two days , according to the schedule			0
the event will kick off with the keynote speech at 9am @entity22 ( 5pm bst ) today and can be watched live on @entity2 ’s @entity1 site			1
it ’s widely expected that @entity2 will announce the next version of its android operating system , 5.0 , on the first day , which will follow the current method of picking the name based on sweets and desserts			1
each iteration takes the next letter in the alphabet			0
previous iterations were ‘ @entity101 ’ and ‘ @entity102 ’ , with this latest os thought to be called ‘ @entity10 ’ - although rumour mills have been wrong before , with many thinking the last update would be ‘ @entity100 ’			2
other notable talks on the first day will revolve around wearable computing			0
@entity2 has already introduced the @entity106 platform but the full launch is expected at @entity108 , with smartwatches from a variety of manufacturers including @entity112 and @entity113 expected to be announced			2
@entity115 analyst @entity114 believes @entity2 , alongside unveiling a new version of its android operating system , will put a ' heavy focus ' on extensions for smartwatches and smart home devices			2
' we think @entity2 will directly counter @entity124 ’s recent announcements of health products ( @entity126 ) and home automation ( @entity128 ) , ' he said			0
anyone for lollipop ? it 's widely expected that @entity2 will announce the next version of its android operating system , 5.0 , on the first day			1
previous iterations were ' @entity101 ' and ' @entity102 ' , with this latest os thought to be called ' @entity10 ' - although rumour mills have been wrong before @entity2 has previously used the @entity1 developer conference to unveil new technologies such as @entity28 , pictured here worn by co-founder @entity136			1
@entity28 recently launched in the @entity137 and was developed by @entity138 - a facility devoted to technological advancements meanwhile , a talk on the second day reveals some other technologies to be announced : ‘ a 3d tablet , an @entity144 , and a little cash			1
tango , @entity147 , @entity148			0
’ ‘ @entity59 ’ here refers to @entity2 ’s @entity149 and projects lab. the @entity59 lab is behind the @entity59 tablet , which will be a device capable of mapping its environment in @entity13			1
its goal is to use 3d scanning technology , akin to that in @entity161 ’s @entity160 sensor , to create 3d maps of an environment			0
this means that a person ’s phone or tablet , for instance , could produce highly detailed interior maps of buildings , rooms and houses			0
and this could allow a device to provide directions inside a building , beyond just a street address			0
@entity178 , meanwhile , is heralded as ‘ the only phone you ’ll ever need ’			0
@entity2 's innovative @entity59 is pictured			1
the technology uses 3d scanning sensors , similar to @entity161 's @entity160 , to create whole maps of interior locations			0
it can be used by a device to automatically build a 3d map of anywhere the user is , allowing for far better indoor navigation @entity178 , pictured , is @entity2 's much - anticipated modular smartphone that could be available in january 2015 for as little as £ 30 ( $ 50 )			1
each component of the smartphone will be upgradeable including the camera and battery , making it the ' only smartphone you 'll ever need ' each component of the jigsaw - like @entity178 phones will be upgradaeable , from the camera to the battery			1
the so - called modular smartphone is expected to go on sale in january 2015 , and could retail for as little as £ 30 ( $ 50 )			2
@entity202 is also expected to be where @entity2 unveils new products in its @entity206 line of tablets			0
the next @entity209 tablet , rumoured to have a resolution of 2560 x 1600 , will compete with @entity124 ’s @entity211 and @entity213 ’s @entity212			0
the smaller , htc - built @entity206 tablet will also be unveiled			0
the @entity215 , meanwhile , suggests that @entity2 is also planning to reveal its @entity9 tv			1
this set - top box , powered by @entity9 , will let users control their tv with any @entity9 device such as a smartphone or tablet , or perhaps even with @entity28			1
the second generation @entity17 ( pictured ) , co-developed with @entity224 , was made available on 26 july 2013 , with the @entity206 thought to be following this year			1
here on 24 july 2013 @entity225 , director of @entity226 at @entity9 , holds a new nexus 7 tablet during a @entity2 event and @entity2 is also expected to reveal an in - car system known as @entity230 - a competitor to @entity124 ’s @entity232			1
its exact purpose is unknown , however , with some suggesting it may just be a way to control @entity9 devices via in - car buttons			1
on the home front , @entity2 ’s @entity237 - which makes network - connected thermostats and smoke detectors - announced earlier this week that it has created a programme that allows outside developers , from tiny startups to large companies such as @entity246 and @entity247 , to fashion software and ' new experiences ' for its products			2
integration with @entity247 , for example , might mean that a car can notify a @entity237 when it is getting close to home , so the device can have the home ’s temperature adjusted to the driver ’s liking before he or she arrives			0
and , finally , one of the last talks at the conference could also prove to be the most interesting			0
‘ robotics in a new world ’ could be a look at some of the artificially - intelligent devices @entity2 is developing , including its smart driverless cars .			2

@entity2 's @entity271 developer conference starts today in @entity23
the two - day event will see new technologies announced by the company
these include previously teased devices such as @entity59 and @entity178
tango is a 3d - mapping tablet , while @entity178 is an upgradeable smartphone
@entity2 typically uses the event to unveil its next - generation @entity17 devices
it may also unveil an @entity9 tv box and an in - car system called @entity230
event could also see the first signs of @entity9 5.0 , *dubbed* ' @entity10 '
