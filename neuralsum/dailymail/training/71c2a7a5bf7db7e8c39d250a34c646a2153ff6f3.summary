by @entity0 a study by the @entity2 found 175 chemicals linked to cancer and fertility problems			1
stock image some food packaging contains hazardous chemicals linked to cancer and fertility , a new study has warned			1
more than 170 dangerous chemicals are legally used in the production of food packaging , scientists have found			1
they warned the toxic substances , which were found to cause cancer and inflict changes on genes , could end up in the food they contain			1
but the @entity22 moved to reassure consumers , explaining all food packaging falls within @entity26 standards and the presence of the chemicals are of no concern if they are used within the ' limits or restrictions ' set for their use			1
the study , published in the journal @entity36 , discovered around 175 chemicals with varying affects			0
they found the substances interfered with sperm production , caused genital malformations and disrupted hormone production in the body			1
doctor @entity44 , managing director of the @entity2 , which conducted the study , said : ' from a consumer perspective , it is certainly undesirable and also unexpected to find chemicals of concern being intentionally used in food contact materials			2
' the list of chemicals found in the packaging , includes those that accumulate in the environment and the human body			1
phthalates , which are widely used as plasticisers , are one example of substances which can cause male fertility and cancer			0
benzophenones and organotin compounds , found in printing inks and the coatings of food wrappings , were also found			0
researchers found some foil , cans , pans and storage containers released substances into food at low levels , to be ingested be people on a daily basis			2
dr @entity44 said the majority of the chemicals of concern identified in the study fulfill the criteria of ' @entity83 ( @entity83 ) ' , set by @entity84			0
under @entity26 rules , chemicals that come under this criteria have to be registered and authorised for use , but the guidelines do not cover food packaging			2
dr @entity44 told the @entity91 : ' @entity84 currently covers consumer products such as toys , but food is different			0
the study warned the substances , found in foil , cans and some containers , could end up in the food they contain			1
but the @entity22 said the chemicals are safe if within the restricted limits set by @entity105 guidelines			2
stock image among the chemicals scientists discovered were benzophenones , which are found in plastics ' we are saying why do n't we bring it together so that we can have a regulation where chemicals used in food packaging would need similar notification before usage			1
' she added : ' as a consequence , chemicals with highly toxic properties may legally be used in the production of food contact materials , but not in other consumer products such as computers , textiles and paints even though exposure through food contact materials may be far more relevant			0
' the report states : ' food contact materials ( @entity130 ) are one possible source of food contaminationm because chemicals may migrate from the material into the food			0
' more than 6,000 @entity130 substances appear on regulatory or non-regulatory lists , some of these substances have been linked to chronic diseases			0
' a @entity22 spokesman moved to reassure people , that food packaging is safe and meet @entity26 standards			2
he said : ' consumers should not be concerned by the presence of chemicals in food contact materials if they are used within any limits or restrictions set for their use			0
