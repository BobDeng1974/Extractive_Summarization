at the indictment on thursday , his wife @entity20 began crying when she said she was not guilty of the three counts of conspiracy and lone count of criminal solicitation			0
her husband also entered a not guilty plea for the same charges , but the prosecution feels that they have a strong case as they have been recording the couples ' interactions			0
the murder - for - hire accusations can be added to his long list of alleged crimes including robbery , transporting heroin , and selling counterfeit dvds , which all took place while he was in uniform			1
according to the @entity42 , @entity2 and @entity20 would use up to five different codenames for the lead witness while plotting the hit during her visits to see @entity2 in jail			1
