by @entity0 september 21st ? rumours are suggesting an earlier than anticipated launch for @entity4 's @entity3 the new @entity3 will have an even thinner screen thanks to advances in lcd manufacturing , according to reports			1
the latest @entity4 gadget will feature ‘ in - cell technology ’ which has touch sensors in the screen instead of another layer on top as it is now			1
the difference would make the new @entity3 about half a millimeter thinner but the image quality would actually improve , the @entity15 claimed			1
it would also allow @entity4 to better take on @entity20 ’s @entity19 which has organic light - emitting displays which do not need to be backlit and are thinner than @entity3 screens			1
@entity20 has been touting the feature as a major selling point to persuade customers to make the switch			1
the @entity28 is 9.3mm deep compared to 8.6mm for the @entity19 @entity4 ’s liquid crystal makers @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 are said to be making hundreds of thousands of panels that will be used in the new @entity3 , possibly the 5th version			1
a thinner screen would make the device more attractive but would also make extra room for more components or features			2
it could also allow more space for the battery which could extend the life of the @entity3 , a constant complaint amongst users			0
according to the @entity15 however ‘ lcd makers are finding the manufacturing process challenging and time - consuming ’ as they try and find the right balance			0
there is mounting speculation that the new @entity3 will have a screen that is larger than the current @entity3 ’s 3.5 inch display , even though the company ’s late founder @entity54 rejected such an idea			0
it 's coming ! @entity58 has released this image , purported to be the @entity3			2
features that can be spotted include a much larger screen , and a smaller dock connector a thinner screen could offset the additional weight and keep it portable enough to compete against @entity20			2
former @entity4 manager @entity65 was recently quoted as saying a larger @entity3 - or smaller @entity66 - could be ‘ appealing to people who do not now carry their @entity66 with them because they are too large and heavy ’			0
she added a seven inch device is too big for a pocket but just the right size for a woman ’s handbag			0
@entity73 printed these images of what they claim is the fascia of the next @entity3 , suggesting the screen is much larger			0

sensors built into glass will make phone even thinner
image quality will actually improve
will allow @entity4 's new handset to beat @entity20 's @entity19
