do your research : do **n’t** just rely on one review , do a thorough online search to ensure the company ’s credentials .
look for the logo : check whether the company is a *member* of a *recognised* trade body such as @entity21 . you can verify *member*ship of @entity21 online , at @entity179
stay safe online : check the web address is legitimate and has not been altered by slight changes to a *domain* name – such as going from . co.uk to . *org*
pay safe : never pay directly into an owner 's bank account . paying by direct bank transfer is like paying by cash – the money can not be traced and is not *refundable* . where possible , pay by credit card , ( or a debit card that offers *protection* ) .
check paperwork : you should study receipts , invoices and terms and conditions , and *beware* of any companies that do **n’t** provide any at all .
use your *instincts* : if something sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
report it – victims should contact @entity138 on 0300 *123* 2040 or via @entity210
