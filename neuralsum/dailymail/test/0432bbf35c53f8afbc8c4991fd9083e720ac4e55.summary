@entity0 would n't have moved any quicker had he been surging towards the posts in a @entity4 clash at @entity5			1
in @entity9 's crowded unsaddling area , the former @entity7 captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number ' 3 ' , with his wife , @entity13 , scampering in hot pursuit			1
not even a hug from @entity16 could check his momentum			2
@entity0 was beaming from ear - to - ear having just seen @entity20 , the horse whom he owns with @entity24 and @entity25 , run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior , who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1 , returned			1
former @entity7 rugby captain @entity0 and wife @entity29 at @entity9 ahead of the @entity30 @entity0 celebrates after watching his horse @entity20 finish third in the @entity30 @entity20 is now 10 and , according to his jockey @entity33 , ' likes to do things at his own pace ' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer @entity39			1
think about this for a cv : a @entity42 in january 2013 , victory in a big chase at @entity45 in december of the same year and being placed in a @entity46 at @entity47 last november , then this			2
not bad for a horse that cost £ 12,000			0
while the exultant connections of winner @entity52 were celebrating a few yards away , their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the @entity20 team ; as @entity39 shook his head in wonder , his father @entity60 , the former champion jump jockey , dashed to engulf him in a bear hug			1
here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the @entity64 's @entity30			1
the £ 88,400 was by far the biggest pot @entity20 has collected in his 24 - race career but the reactions of @entity69 ( @entity70 ) showed this was about far more than money			1
' pride is the word i would use , ' said @entity39			0
' i am so happy for the horse			0
he is unbelievably tough and brave			0
to put in a performance like that after coming here last year ( finishing seventh ) , i am just so proud			2
the owners are buzzing , so is the jockey			0
' many clouds and @entity82 jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 @entity30 at @entity9 @entity33 's contented look as he strolled to the @entity86 and trainers tent a little while after said as much			1
he won the @entity30 in 2009 , when steering @entity88 to a 100/1 success , but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010 , when unseating at the 20th from @entity93			1
' i am absolutely delighted , ' said @entity33			0
' the horse did n't even know he had been in a race			2
he got hampered at @entity97 the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride			0
' last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when i thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at @entity107			2
but what a great day			0
i really appreciate everything about this atmosphere now			0
' he was n't the only one			0
@entity9 , even when you are defeated , is a place where dreams can come true .			1
