@entity1 striker @entity0 could follow @entity2 to @entity3 this summer			1
the 21 - year - old has one year to run on his current deal and has not been offered a new contract – this despite manager @entity8 issuing the player with an ultimatum last week			1
the @entity11 said : ' for me , @entity0 ’s situation is clear			0
he needs to sign a new contract or we let him go – we sell him			0
there is nothing in between			0
@entity3 boss @entity26 tried to sign him in 2011 and was manager of @entity29 when the youngster played in their academy			1
@entity33 are also monitoring the situation and @entity0 – who lives in @entity3 - could be available for around £ 6million , £ 2m less than the fee @entity1 paid @entity37 three years ago			2
will he stay or will he go ? @entity1 are keen to keep @entity0 after he scored some important goals last season the @entity41 star scored the goals which kept the @entity1 in the @entity42 last season and he is happy at the @entity43			2
however , the club 's failure to offer him a new deal has left him considering his options			0
@entity1 , though , can ill afford to lose another first - team player with @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity2 having already left since the end of last season			0
swapping sides : @entity2 joined @entity3 this summer after leaving @entity1 reunited : @entity26 was manager of @entity29 when @entity0 was in the academy there @entity2 joined the @entity56 on a free transfer after his contract expired but @entity1 will not allow the same situation to unfold with @entity0 - although being under 24 compensation would be due - and he will be sold if an agreement is not reached .			1
