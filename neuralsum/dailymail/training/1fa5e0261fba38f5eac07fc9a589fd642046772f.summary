by @entity1 reporter published : 23:53 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 01:27 est , 28 february 2013 the @entity2 is warning doctors to be on the lookout for an untreatable multidrug - resistant ' superbug ' emerging in the @entity6 the ' superbug ' springs from a bacteria called @entity11 - resistant @entity10 , 15 types of which have been seen in the @entity6 in the last year			1
the unique bacteria can cause pneumonia , intestinal and urinary tract infections , and bloodstream infections			1
in one outbreak at the @entity20 , seven deaths were attributed to the ' superbug ' after a @entity23 woman who came to the hospital for a lung transplant while infected			1
drug resistant : @entity28 's may live in the intestines and lungs and may cause pneumonia , meningitis , and other diseases the victims included one 16 - year - old boy			1
@entity28 , or @entity28 , are bacteria that are unique in that they are resistant to most antibiotics			1
they typically live in the soil or water			0
patients infected with the bacteria are typically not symptomatic , but can develop pneumonia , kidney and bladder infections , and bloodstream infectioins			1
they began appearing in the @entity6 roughly ten years ago , and have since spread to at least 41 states			2
there is no effective treatment yet available for the bacteria , which can linger in the body more than a year , and mortality rates hover at 40 to 50 per cent			1
the infections are associated with mortality rates of 40 to 50 per cent			2
the rise means health care providers must ' act aggressively to prevent the emergence and spread of these unusual @entity28 organisms , ' the @entity2 said			2
' from the perspective of drug - resistant organisms , ( @entity28 ) is the most serious threat , the most serious challenge we face to patient safety , ' @entity61 , associate director for prevention of health care - associated infections at the @entity2 , told @entity71			1
it can take over a year to be rid of @entity28 bacteria , with one study determining the average patient requiring 387 days for it to be out of their system			1
' we 're working with state health departments to try to figure out how big a problem this is , ' @entity61 said , noting that his agency can pool whatever incidence data states collect			0
' we 're still at a point where we can stop this thing			0
you can never eradicate @entity28 , but we can prevent the spread			1
... it 's a matter of summoning the will			2
' @entity92 flourish in the soil , water , and the human gut			0
a ' superbug , ' @entity28 has a high level of resistance to antibiotics			1
sterile : the @entity2 is recommending that any doctors who treat patients with a superbug be tested themselves and refrain from treating patients not infected disturbingly , the patients are not symptomatic , as the bug waits in the body until the immune system is compromised and an infection sets in			1
the first known @entity6 case was detected at a @entity112 hospital in 2001 , and since then @entity28 's have been detected in at least 41 other states			2
many cases still go unrecognized until its too late for the patient			0
since the first known case , at a @entity112 hospital , was reported in 2001 , @entity116 have spread to at least 41 other states , according to the @entity2			0
and many cases still go unrecognized , because it can be tough to do the proper laboratory analysis , particularly at smaller hospitals or nursing homes			0
people diagnosed with a @entity28 infection usually get it after taking antibiotics and undergoing significant medical treatment for other conditions			2
also in the news last summer was an outbreak of @entity28 in eight patients - the largest outbreak in the @entity6 so far			0
none of the patients in the initial outbreak died			0
resistant : @entity28 's are resistant to treatment and doctors must be aggressive in watching for the infections the hospital was able to detect the outbreak early largely due to stringent surveillance protocols			1
the @entity2 said most @entity28 cases were ' isolated from patients who received overnight medical treatment outside of the @entity6			0
' there are @entity2 guidelines to deal with the infection in the center 's 2012 @entity28 toolkit			2
if you share a room with a person with a @entity28 infection you should be screened immediately			0
health care providers who treat infected patients should also be examined			0
they should not treat non-infected patients after treating infected ones			0
health care facilities must also be made aware of any @entity28 infected patients being transferred to their care .			0

at least seven deaths were traced to the infection in an outbreak at the @entity20 last year
the ' superbug ' springs from a type of bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics and can linger in the body for more than a year
the bacteria can cause pneumonia , intestinal and urinary tract infections , and bloodstream infections
doctors say it 's still *impossible* to eradicate the ' superbug ' and are focusing on containing the spread
