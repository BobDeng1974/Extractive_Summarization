parents should insist on seeing their children ’s texts and internet exchanges , @entity5 ’s new adviser on childhood urged last night			1
@entity7 said that in a world where youngsters are surrounded by online dangers , parents should challenge the ‘ bizarre ’ idea that their children have the right to keep their messages private			1
in her first interview since being appointed last month , the 48 - year - old mother of three added that society as a whole has been ‘ complicit ’ in allowing a culture where youngsters can make inappropriate contact with strangers at all hours of the day and night			1
parents should feel more empowered to challenge their children over their phone and internet usage and read their messages mrs @entity7 said ‘ sexting ’ – where children send each other explicit images of themselves – went on in ‘ pretty much every school in the country ’			1
she said parents should feel ‘ empowered ’ to challenge their offspring about their use of mobile phones and social media sites such as @entity37 , and demand to look at their messages if necessary			1
the @entity40 mp for @entity41 added that parents had to take clearer responsibility for internet access on their children ’s laptops and mobile phones			1
‘ so many people say “ i have got children on their laptop at 2am – what do i do ? ” well , turn the router off when you go to bed , ’ she said			2
mrs @entity7 set out a range of proposals in her new role as @entity5 ’s adviser on the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood			1
they include : on the issue of children ’s texts and internet exchanges , mrs @entity7 said : ‘ we ’ve given our children all these opportunities to communicate in private , but we ’ve lost the confidence to actually get involved in that			1
' we have to feel more empowered to ask			0
make sure your kids allow you to be friends with them on @entity37 , ask them whether what they are doing is appropriate			0
the mp wants internet safety taught in the classroom and says ' sexting ' goes on in ' pretty much every school in the country ' ‘ we have got to be much franker , much more open and upfront about it			1
i do n’t want it to sound like harking back to @entity81 values , but parents should sit down with their kids and say “ are you aware of what ’s out there ? ”			2
’ mrs @entity7 was appointed by mr @entity5 after leading a successful campaign for an ‘ opt - in ’ system for online porn in households with children			1
she told the @entity93 she was concerned about a broader , growing ‘ clash between family values and technology ’			2
‘ in a way we have all been complicit			2
we ca n’t say it ’s all government ’s responsibility , or industry ’s or parents ’ – we have got to work together , ’ she said			2
‘ when you and i were growing up the idea your parents would allow you to communicate daily with strangers , that you would have letters or phone calls coming into your home , would have been bizarre			1
‘ yet we have now given our kids the space to be private with their phones and internet connections			2
‘ this whole issue of peer - to - peer contact is very difficult			2
you ca n’t filter it using technology			0
parents are not monitoring it and we do n’t feel we should			0
i said to my daughter , “ perhaps i should read your texts ” and she looked at me like i was insane			0
i thought , “ well actually i am paying for it ”			0
’ rallying call : @entity7 said society is ' complicit ' in allowing a culture where children can contact strangers day and night mrs @entity7 said the latest evidence suggested the level of ‘ sexting ’ was ‘ absolutely horrific ’			1
last week , an inquest heard how @entity134 , a 13 - year - old @entity135 schoolgirl , fell to her death from a block of flats after begging a boy on the pavement below to delete a sex video of her on his phone			0
‘ it is usually girls who are on the receiving end of some pretty degrading stuff , ’ the mp said			1
‘ we ’ve got young girls being asked to write their names on their boobs and send pictures			1
parents would be really shocked to know this is happening in pretty much every school in the country			0
our children are growing up in a very sexualised world			0
’ mrs @entity7 suggested there should be a simple , well - advertised system for parents and children to report harmful or inappropriate contacts			1
on children ’s internet access via laptops and mobile phones , she said : ‘ less than 40 per cent of families have downloaded filters onto their internet - enabled devices			1
some of that is due to ignorance , some of it time pressure , ’ she said			0
‘ if you ask parents where children learn about internet safety , the majority say at school			1
yes , schools have got a role to play			0
but we have got to be prepared as parents to talk to our kids about these things			0
it ’s difficult and it ’s challenging but it ’s right			0
‘ you can set time limits , block surfing at particular hours , block access to different websites			0
there is an innovation and sophistication around controls			0
but ultimately , you can turn off children ’s access to the internet			1
’ mrs @entity7 said there was a case for re-examining the school curriculum so that internet safety is included in it lessons			1
she was also ‘ really concerned ’ about ‘ completely lewd ’ music videos that are not currently age - rated			1
‘ we are n’t in the business of saying we want to stop @entity209 gyrating around , ’ she said			0
‘ but it ’s not right that someone of any age can click online and see it			2
parents should be able to say they do n’t want their children watching this stuff			0
it ’s not about censorship			0
but films are age - rated and it should be the same in the online world			0
let ’s adopt a new system of classification using the @entity225			0
that wo n’t mean more spending and regulation			0
’ on ‘ lads ’ mags ’ , mrs @entity7 said she regarded them as ‘ appalling and demeaning ’ , adding : ‘ i ca n’t understand why anyone would ever pose for them			1
’ @entity7 is one of the @entity40 ’s rising stars , having only been elected in 2010			1
the 48 - year - old mother - of - three lives near @entity237 , @entity238 , and grew up in @entity239			0
after attending her local comprehensive school she went to @entity241 , @entity242 , where she read geography			0
a career in banking followed , but after three years , in 1990 , she studied for an mba at @entity247			0
after jobs with @entity249 and @entity250 , mrs @entity7 gave up work in 2000 to raise her children , but carried on fundraising for local schools and hospitals			2
she joined the @entity40 in 2006 , and was asked to work for shadow chancellor @entity255 as a special adviser the following year			2
in 2010 she was picked to represent the safe @entity40 seat of @entity41 , which she won with a 13,000 majority			1
she said a report to the prime minister by @entity262 boss @entity261 , due to be updated within the next few weeks , had recommended that such magazines should not be displayed at children ’s eye level , but there had been only ‘ patchy progress ’			1
she also said the culture of airbrushing celebrity photos was ‘ very damaging ’			2
‘ there ’s huge , huge pressure on young girls			1
i ’m a mother of two daughters and i can see the pressures to look thin and beautiful , ’ she added			0
mrs @entity7 said she supported those calling for airbrushed images to be labelled to make it clear they have been digitally enhanced			2
she said she was prepared to be branded ‘ the @entity281 of the 2010s ’ by some critics of her new role and had already attracted a ‘ crowd of hateful @entity285 followers ’			0
but she insisted : ‘ when i am finished i want @entity286 to be absolutely leading the world in online child safety			2
