' but i 'm very lucky and confident and it 's water off a duck 's back to me			0
' ' it 's not that i do n't want to be helped - i just do n't want to diet			0
for me , a diet starts on a monday and stops by a tuesday			0
i have zero willpower and am not going to choose a salad over something greasy			0

' ms @entity5 spoke out after a new report warned that millions of people in the @entity45 could be failing to recognise that they are obese - putting themselves at risk of early death			1
the research , conducted by the charity @entity50 , found that two - fifths of obese people had no concerns about serious illness due to their weight			1
unaware : ms @entity5 - with @entity11 's dr @entity56 - spoke out after a new report warned that millions of people in the @entity45 could be failing to recognise that they are obese - putting themselves at risk of early death being obese increases the risk of a number of potentially fatal diseases such as heart disease , some types of cancer , stroke and type 2 diabetes			1

meanwhile , 44 per cent of those who are obese said they have no concerns about serious illness due to their weight			1
and many did not recognise the links between obesity and health problems			0
eight in 10 of those polled did not know about the link between obesity and some cancers such as breast and bowel cancer			0
@entity50 questioned 3,100 people about their health and well - being - including about perceptions of their weight			1
half believed themselves to be overweight and six per cent thought they were obese			1

the charity said that there is a " clear misconception " over what weight is considered to be obese			2
if the figures are extrapolated , this means around six million people in the @entity45 could be at risk by not recognising that they are obese and the associated health risks , a charity spokeswoman said			1
around two - thirds were unaware about obese people 's increase risk of liver disease or osteoarthritis			1
and 46 per cent were not aware about the link between obesity and stroke			0

' he added that a third of morbidly obese people suffer from depression			2
he said to ms @entity5 : ' i do think you could be happier			2
do you think you could be happier if you were thinner ? ' she replied : ' i really do n't think it would make any difference			0
a few years ago , i was five or six stone lighter and i felt no different then to now			0
' but when i was dieting i was miserable			0
i love food - if there is chocolate or an apple , i will take a chocolate			1
' i 'm not saying an apple will make me unhappy , but a chocolate will make me happier			2
when asked is she was concerned about the impact of her weight on her health , she said : ' i have heard it time again , not just from doctors but from my family and friends			1
' but do you know what ? everything that we like or are addicted to - and not just food , but drugs , cigarettes , whatever - someone has something to say			2
it 's very easy to jump on the bandwagon			0
