by @entity0 the deputy prime minister insisted he planned to lead the party until 2020 - but his team gave three possible dates he could step down @entity5 sparked frenzied speculation about the @entity8 leadership last night after failing to give a clear answer on when he might stand down			1
the deputy prime minister insisted he planned to lead the party until 2020 – but only after his team had put forward three different possibilities as to when he will quit			1
the farcical mixed message came amid growing speculation that @entity16 and @entity17 are manoeuvring to replace him			1
mr @entity5 ’s aides first indicated that he would fight the next election and remain leader ‘ beyond ’ 2015 – giving no further guarantees			0
but sources close to mr @entity5 then suggested he would quit as leader if the @entity8 were not part of a coalition government in 2015			1
when asked whether mr @entity5 would stay on as leader until 2020 , a spokesman for the deputy prime minister said : ‘ if the @entity8 are back in government again then @entity5 intends to serve a full term			1
’ mr @entity5 ’s office then tried to backtrack , with his spokesman saying : ‘ our entire focus is on delivering @entity8 priorities in government and then getting the @entity8 back into government in 2015			1
’ but the spokesman also noted that mr @entity5 was ‘ only 47 ’ – a clear nod to him being able to embark on a second career , perhaps as an @entity40 commissioner			0
his intention to quit the leadership if it did not come with the trappings of power that come with the @entity45 threatened to overshadow his keynote speech to the party ’s spring conference			0
three hours later , after frantic talks behind the scenes , mr @entity5 ’s office adopted yet another position			0
they tried to quell the leadership speculation , insisting : ‘ @entity5 intends to be the leader of the @entity8 today , tomorrow and into the 2015 election and through the whole of the next parliament			2
the farcical mixed message came amid growing speculation that @entity16 ( left ) and @entity17 are manoeuvring to replace @entity5 ' he intends to be leader of the @entity8 whether or not we are in government			1
’ but the backtracking came after @entity16 , the chief secretary to the treasury , emerged as one of the front - runners to replace him			0
he will have to fight off competition from left - wing party president @entity67 , who is popular with activists , and business secretary @entity17 , who is the most recognisable @entity8 apart from mr @entity5			1
leading @entity8 believe mr @entity16 ’s high profile in recent weeks is part of a concerted effort by @entity73 to position his protégé as a possible replacement			2
mr @entity16 – who has recently had a makeover , ditching his glasses and hiring a media adviser – has been reappointed to lead negotiations in the event of another hung parliament			0
asked on @entity84 ’s @entity83 programme if he wanted the top job , mr @entity16 refused to rule himself out , saying : ‘ there ’s no vacancy , i hope there is n’t a vacancy for many years to come			0
@entity5 is doing a fantastic job , i ’ve got a big job to do			0
’ mr @entity17 is understood to view mr @entity16 ’s ambitions with incredulity and still fancies his chances of the top job			2
‘ @entity17 has been dormant , but he can erupt again , ’ one @entity8 observer noted .			2

deputy *pm* says he plans to lead @entity8 until 2020
but before that his team gave three possible dates he will step down
