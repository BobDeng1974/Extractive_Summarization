unsurprisingly considering she is a friend of the controversial @entity4 , notorious for his felony assault on former girlfriend @entity88 , ms @entity74 says that @entity6 was the one who turned the bickering into a violent showdown			1
best of enemies : @entity6 , left , and @entity4 , right , seen partying on opposite sides of club @entity93 before the night ended in bottle throwing with @entity4 sustaining a cut to the chin the situation started when @entity4 sent a bottle of expensive champagne over to @entity6 's table , allegedly as an alcoholic peace offering to the rapper who has also been romantically linked to @entity103			1
object of their affection : @entity88 , seen here on friday in @entity108 , was not at the club at the time of the fight but was clearly on their minds ms @entity74 says that ' i then saw a waitress come back with a piece of paper and gave it to @entity4 , ' which was supposedly a note that read ' i 'm f * * * * * * the love of your life , deal with it '			1
' ( @entity4 ) looked upset and just threw it on the floor , ' she said			1
' ( @entity6 and his entourage ) were giving him the middle finger			1
they got into each other 's faces and were shouting at each other			1
' @entity4 told @entity6 to f * * * off , and the next thing i could hear is the sound of smashed glass and mayhem started			1

the likelihood of an arrest seems very slim at this time			0
@entity17 is the second unconnected bystander to release photos of her injuries , as the first was arguably the most serious			0
@entity160 , an @entity161 tourist , was rushed to @entity162 after she was smashed in the head with a flying bottle during the fight			1

she needed 16 stitches to close the wound			0
@entity160 told @entity18 she went to @entity41 with friends on wednesday night , unaware they were sitting in between two angry rappers and their entourages			2
