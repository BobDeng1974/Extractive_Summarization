by @entity0 scientists claim that the ' trophy wife ' stereotype - demonstrated here by @entity4 and his wife @entity5 - is rare it is easy to jump to the conclusion that a pretty young woman arm - in - arm with a much older man is attracted to him because of this money - or that he is only with her for her looks			1
but scientists believe the ‘ trophy wife ’ stereotype - which sees both sexes place little importance on their partner ’s character other than looks or earnings - is largely a myth			2
a study claims that the myth is fuelled by ' selective observation ' that reinforces sexist stereotypes and trivialises women 's careers			0
@entity29 , a sociologist at the @entity30 , @entity31 , found evidence that couples who fit the ‘ trophy wife ’ stereotype , actually match in terms of physical attractiveness and socioeconomic status			1
a sample of young couples were interviewed and rated for physical attractiveness so that dr @entity29 could identify a ‘ control group ’ for matching on attractiveness			0
‘ i find that handsome men partner with pretty women and successful men partner with successful women , ’ said the specialist in inequality within romantic partnerships			1
‘ so , on average , high - status men do have better - looking wives , but this is because they themselves are considered better looking - perhaps because they are less likely to be overweight and more likely to afford braces , nice clothes and trips to the dermatologist			0
' ‘ secondly , the strongest force by far in partner selection is similarity - in education , race , religion and physical attractiveness			0
’ dr @entity29 's research shows that there is not , in fact , a general tendency for women to trade beauty for money			0
while trophy wife marriages do happen , they are very rare , she continued			0
the study found that handsome men often partner with pretty women , and successful men usually partner with successful women			1
dr @entity29 said that @entity79 founders @entity80 ( pictured left ) and @entity81 ( right ) both married highly accomplished women - one of whom has a phd and the other who is an entrepreneur a study by the @entity30 , @entity31 , found evidence that couples who appear to fit the ‘ trophy wife ’ stereotype , actually match in terms of physical attractiveness and socioeconomic status			1
sociologist dr @entity29 explained that handsome men typically partner with pretty women , and successful men partner are normally attracted to successful women			1
' the strongest force by far in partner selection is similarity - in education , race , religion and physical attractiveness , ’ she said			0
her study found that women do not tend to trade beauty for money and that trophy wives are very rare and that beautiful women can not often move upwards in terms of class by marrying someone			1
@entity4 ’s marriage to his third wife @entity5 , may be an exception to the study 's rule			1
dr @entity29 said : ‘ @entity4 may very well exemplify the trophy wife stereotype			1
' but , there are many examples of rich men who partner with successful women rather than “ buying ” a supermodel wife			2
’ she gave the example of @entity79 founders @entity81 and @entity80 , who both married highly accomplished women - one of whom has a phd and the other who is a wealthy entrepreneur			0
dr @entity29 believes the trophy wife stereotype is most often wrongly - applied among non-celebrities			2
‘ i 've heard doctors ' wives referred to as trophy wives by observers who only notice her looks and his status and fail to realise that he is good - looking too and that she is also a successful professional - or was before she had kids and left her job , ’ she said			2
dr @entity29 's research also indicates that , contrary to the trophy wife stereotype , social class barriers in the marriage market are relatively impermeable			0
beautiful women are unlikely to use their looks to secure upward mobility by marriage .			0

' trophy wives ' are typically seen to be young women who appeal to their *husbands* because of their looks
but a study has found couples who appear to *conform* to this stereotype often match in terms of physical and socioeconomic status
handsome men typically partner with pretty women
while successful *people* often choose a lover who is equally successful
however ' trophy wife ' exceptions do exist , such as @entity4 and his model wife @entity5 , a sociologist said
