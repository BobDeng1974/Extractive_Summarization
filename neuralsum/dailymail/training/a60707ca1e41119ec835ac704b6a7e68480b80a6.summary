a mural depicting money - grabbing bankers will be removed following complaints that it resembles the anti-semitic propaganda of @entity5			1
the provocative painting has appeared on a wall in the predominantly @entity9 area of @entity10 in @entity11 , once a thriving @entity13 community			2
the mural , by international graffiti artist @entity14 , shows moustachioed and hooked - nosed bankers huddled around a @entity18 board supported on the backs of the working class , seemingly drawing on long outdated @entity13 stereotypes			1
@entity22 , pictured , is defending the artwork which has been painted on his property			1
he described the wall as showing world leaders playing monopoly on a table held up by tax payers now the artist has been accused of @entity31 , a claim he vehemently denies			2
but with its continued presence causing public tolerance to fray , council bosses have set a deadline for its removal			2
@entity14 - real name @entity39 - completed the painting last month in an area steeped in @entity13 history			1
@entity45 immigrants fleeing persecution in @entity47 first settled in @entity10 in the 1880s and the area remained a proud @entity13 neighbourhood until the 1960s			0
local councillor and long - term resident @entity51 has urged the police to pursue the inflammatory artist under race hate laws			1

it ’s horribly similar to the propaganda used by the @entity5 in @entity5			1
‘ the money hoarding and hooked - nosed men is classic @entity5			1
the mural , painted on a wall in @entity10 , @entity11 , has been branded as anti-semitic by @entity64 council local councillor and long - term resident @entity51 , who has branded the mural anti-semitic , has urged the police to pursue the inflammatory artist under race hate laws ‘ it ’s seriously worrying in an area that is so culturally sensitive - @entity10 was home to the @entity13 community and now home to another immigrant group			1
he added : ‘ it ’s intensely racist and has caused a great deal of offence			0
‘ these horrible stereotypes are not just unpleasant and divisive , they are dangerous as they feed prejudice			0

the money hoarding and hooked - nosed men is classic @entity5			2
' he said : ‘ i have received a number of complaints that the mural has anti-semitic images			1
whether intentional or otherwise , the images of the bankers perpetuate anti-semitic propaganda about conspiratorial @entity13 domination of financial and political institutions			2
‘ where freedom of expression runs the risk of inciting racial hatred then it is right that such expression should be curtailed			0
i have asked my officers to do everything possible to see to it that this mural is removed			0

this mural uses images that have for centuries been used to incite hatred and persecution against @entity13 communities			0
there is no place for such incitement against any community in this borough ”			0
but mr @entity39 claims his mural has been misunderstood and , while it is supposed to provoke critical thought and debate , is not supposed to be anti-semitic			1
he said : ‘ a group of conservatives do not like my mural and are playing a race card with me			2
’ by way of explaination the artist , who has been labelled ‘ the @entity144 ’ wrote under a video of him creating the artwork on @entity149 : artist @entity39 claims his mural has been misunderstood and , while it is supposed to provoke critical thought and debate , is not supposed to be anti-semitic he said : ‘ my mural is about class & privilege			1
