by @entity0 published : 09:58 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 04:08 est , 14 january 2014 rural villagers say they have been cut off by @entity3 after a @entity5 health and safety boss ruled their road was too muddy			1
@entity3 health and safety chiefs have ruled that the country lanes in the villages of @entity10 and @entity11 near @entity12 are too ' slippery and dangerous ' and have banned deliveries in this area , following a complaint by a postman saying the trips are a ' muddy hell '			1
@entity19 , 63 , who lives in the area said : ' it is crazy that a bit of rain can stop the @entity3			1
' it does get muddy in the winter , but it 's no muddier now than in other winters			2
householders in the village of @entity28 , @entity12 , have been cut off from mail deliveries because the roads are too ' unsafe ' due to mud @entity33 conditions do n't often stop the @entity3 , which has a policy to deliver despite harsh and severe weather ' delivery drivers from other companies had no trouble dropping off parcels before @entity40 and our regular postman knows the route well , but this was a complaint for a relief postman			1
' @entity19 's neighbour @entity47 , 64 , said : ' i walk along the lanes every day and it is absolutely fine with a pair of wellies			2
' some people would rather see all the fields covered in concrete and tarmac rather than get a bit muddy			2
' there 's nothing more natural than the @entity61 weather			0
' @entity19 who lives in one of the villages has been leading the campaign to re-instate the postal service in their area a @entity3 spokesperson said : ' we suspended deliveries after a postman reported that the path was extremely muddy and slippery as a result of the inclement weather			1
' deliveries were suspended following a visit by a senior health and safety manager after a postman reported problems walking along a muddy woodland path			1
' our postmen and women go out in all weather conditions including wind , rain , snow and ice			2
' it is always a last resort if we decide not to deliver to a specific address or addresses			0
' the safety of our colleagues is paramount			0
we will only suspend deliveries if the safety of our postmen and women is at risk			1
' villagers are running a campaign in the villages to try and lift the ban			0
this is n't the first time that the @entity3 has not delivered due to complaints by postmen			1
in june 2012 , @entity3 suspended deliveries during ' adverse wet weather conditions ' after a postman slipped on algae and moss on the pavement and broke his shoulder			1
in october of last year , a cheque was n't delivered to a business owner because a spider the size of a ten pence piece was blocking the garden gate			0
the weather conditions in the @entity61 over the past winter have been some of the most extreme on record , with some places in @entity61 having an entire month 's rainfall in the first week of the month			1
when asked about the recent weather and affects to the @entity3 's service ' whereas the recent bad weather did not significantly impact @entity3 ’s service and network , it did cause some limited disruption at a local level – mainly due to flooding			2
' the business is well accustomed to implementing contingency measures in preparation for and response to extreme weather events			0
' @entity139 , a former postman , who delivered post during the 2012/13 winter , one of the coldest and snowiest for the @entity61 in years , said : ' i ruined my knee running during the snow on my first week			0
' i had to run to get my rounds done in time , because they did n't pay overtime			0
' on the other hand , if it 's sunny , people expect you to be happy , but there are dogs everywhere and you 're just too hot			0
' @entity154 was the best			0
' essentially , the weather was constantly the bane of my existence			0
' @entity159 weather and heavy rainfall over the recent months have caused damage to many roads , and rural roads with no tarmac or surfacing often suffer the most the chalet properties along the roads between and inside the villages have had to go to the local sorting office to collect their post			2

extreme rainfall has made country lanes ' slippery and dangerous '
@entity3 have barred their postmen from delivering to certain areas
' too boggy ' to carry *postbags* in ' muddy hell ' of village roads
village campaigners near @entity12 want to see the deliveries resume
