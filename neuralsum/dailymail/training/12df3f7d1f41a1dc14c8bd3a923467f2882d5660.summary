the common perception of purebred dogs is that they are more striking , beautiful animals than they would be without human intervention			2
however , that notion has been thrown to the dogs			2
strong photographic evidence has emerged that shows how 100 years of breeding has actually warped the good looks of the original hounds			1
he explained : ‘ to be able to make an honest comparison , i ’ve chosen pictures with similar poses and in a couple of cases flipped the picture to get them both aligned in the same direction			0
i had to skip some breeds i wanted to include because of the lack of detail in the older photographs			0
’ the modern boxer now has a shorter face and slightly upturned nose his comparison shows how the @entity42 has become lower and now has ‘ excessively large ears ’			1
the modern @entity44 , he says , now has even more difficulty controlling temperature because its face is shorter and the muzzle is now slightly upturned			1
size matters ? the @entity52 bulldog is now a hefty animal compared to 100 years ago the @entity52 bulldog – the star of the @entity57 insurance ads – has become a real brute thanks to breeding			1
@entity59 said : ‘ the bulldog ’s monstrous proportions make them virtually incapable of mating or birthing without medical intervention			0
’ how low can you go ? the dachshund 's legs are now much shorter the @entity68 , meanwhile , now has a ‘ mutated skull ’ and is nowhere near as handsome as it used to be , according to @entity69			1
photographs of the @entity72 show how its legs and body are no longer in proportion , meaning that it ’s now more prone to intervertebral disc disease			2
bigger and better ? the @entity79 is now much stockier the @entity80 has also gone downhill , according to the blogger			0
he says that they used to be able to clear an 8.5ft wall , but are now ‘ angulated and barrel - chested ’ , meaning that such a feat would no longer be possible			0
verdict : the dog blogger claims that the modern - day @entity88 shepherd would not be able to match its predecessor 's athletic ability pugs have had a double - curl tail bred into them , but @entity59 says that this can lead to paralysis			1
and its folded skin can lead to overheating			0
one of the most striking transformations is the @entity79 , which used to be a sturdy athletic breed but now have lots of overheating problems and are more prone to disease			0
face facts : the bull terrier now has a different - shaped skull @entity107 : the pug now has a tail that can lead to paralysis , the dog blogger explained @entity112 , @entity113 , points out that there are both good and bad examples of dog breeding , partly because of the way it 's organised			1
she told @entity119 : ' dog breeding is a relatively unregulated industry , and for every responsible breeder producing healthy animals there is somebody breeding dogs for money and to achieve a certain fashionable look , who has no need to adhere to the health rules in the @entity132 or to any other criteria			1
' there are clear rules and vet checks in place at dog shows to ensure unhealthy and exaggerated dogs do not win prizes and the @entity141 is the only scheme in the country that sets standards for and monitors breeders , but outside of this there is no regulation to protect dogs or guide puppy buyers			2
' puppy buyers should always see the pup with its mother and avoid any puppies that come from parents with overly exaggerated features , which might include excessive wrinkling , overly short snouts or being overweight			0
