@entity0 , 40 , has been trying to get refugee status for seven years , but was repeatedly turned down by the courts , who ruled he would not suffer if he returned to his home country @entity5 a failed asylum seeker who has dodged deportation from @entity8 for nearly a decade has been told he can stay – because he goes to the gym			2
@entity0 , 40 , has been trying to get refugee status for seven years , but was repeatedly turned down by the courts , who ruled he would not suffer if he returned to his home country @entity5			2
but he has now told judges he has a private life that involves going for work - outs with his friends – which means his human rights would be violated if he was deported			2
the controversial legal ruling by @entity20 ’s @entity19 means he will be allowed to continue living rent - free in his publicly funded flat and claiming a weekly allowance			2
earlier this month , a top @entity20 judge issued a written decision in which he agreed the case should be referred back to home secretary @entity25 for fresh consideration			2
this effectively means the threat of deportation has been removed and @entity0 is free to remain in @entity20 indefinitely			2
lord @entity42 ’s judgment read : ‘ he had integrated well within the @entity44 community , had a large network of friends , most of whom were @entity20 , and socialised with those friends at the gymnasium , at five - a - side football , in coffee shops , at college , in the library and at their homes			1
‘ he went on to say that he made use of local facilities , such as the library and @entity44 leisure centres '			1
@entity0 ’s claim , it said , was ‘ based on @entity51 and , in particular , on the fact that he had , so he claimed , established a private life in the @entity8			1
@entity0 was smuggled into @entity56 on a lorry in 2005			1
in his asylum application he claimed his father ’s pro-jewish sympathies put him in danger in @entity5 – but it was rejected , as were two appeals			2
in his asylum application he claimed his father ’s pro-jewish sympathies put him in danger in @entity5 – but it was rejected , as were two appeals			2
having travelled to @entity44 , where he lived with his sister for two years , he appealed to the @entity19			1
but in june 2009 , @entity67 ruled he had consistently failed to provide any ‘ credible ’ evidence that he would personally face any persecution or disadvantage in @entity5			1
@entity0 was smuggled into @entity56 ( pictured ) on a lorry in 2005			1
in his asylum application he claimed his father 's pro-jewish sympathies put him in danger in @entity5 - but it was rejected , as were two appeals the decision marked the end of @entity0 ’s rights of appeal			0
technically , he should then have been removed as an illegal immigrant , but no action to deport him was taken			0
lord @entity42 's ruling effectively means the threat of deportation has been removed and @entity0 is free to remain in @entity20 indefinitely in february 2010 , @entity0 wrote to @entity83 , asking for ‘ leave to remain ’ based on @entity51			1
when that was rejected , he launched another appeal to the @entity19			0
this appeal was the one that led to him being allowed to stay			0
@entity0 said recently that he ‘ feels comfortable ’ in @entity44 and does not have anybody left back in @entity5			1
last night , his case - which has already cost the public purse tens of thousands of pounds - sparked outrage			0
@entity92 , said : ‘ if the occasional trip to the gym is enough to allow a failed asylum seeker to appeal his deportation , then taxpayers will wonder who ca n’t claim a right to stay			1
‘ he should have been deported when his case was initially rejected			1
it ’s appalling that we are left picking up all of his bills when he should have been sent home years ago '			0
a @entity83 ( @entity83 ) spokesman said : ‘ too often , article 8 [ of the @entity106 , guaranteeing the right to a private and family life ] has been used to place the family rights of illegal migrants above the rights of the @entity8 public in seeing our immigration laws properly enforced , and that balance needs to be redressed			1
‘ the government will change the immigration rules to reinforce the public interest in seeing those who have breached our immigration laws removed from this country			1
‘ we have been seeking to remove this individual , but we have been asked by the courts to look again at this case			1
‘ where we do not believe someone has the right to stay in this country , we expect them to return home '			1
partners : @entity133 immigrant mr @entity132 ( left ) with @entity8 librarian @entity134 @entity132 found himself at the centre of the ' catgate ' scandal earlier this month when home secretary @entity137 used the @entity133 as an example to illustrate how easy it is for illegal immigrants to not be deported			0
the 36 - year - old 's cat , @entity142 , was the reason he was not kicked out , may , angling to ditch the controversial @entity144 , claimed			0
but justice secretary @entity145 clashed with may at the @entity146 and stood up for @entity132			0
he angered the conservatives by deriding her claim of the cat ’s importance to the case as ‘ laughable ’ and ‘ complete nonsense ’ - and though he was correct he was roundly criticised			1
@entity132 , a trained architect who had been in the country since 2002 , stayed illegally in @entity8 for more than two years after his student visa expired			0
his situation came to the attention of the authorities in 2007 when he was accused of shoplifting an ornamental cat			0
@entity160 : the feline , @entity142 , who helped persuade a judge that @entity132 should be allowed to remain in @entity8 but he fought off a @entity165 move to deport him , arguing that his joint ownership of @entity167 with @entity8 librarian @entity134 , a 49 - year - old @entity168 graduate , showed the seriousness of their relationship			0
' when we got @entity142 in 2005 we never thought it would lead to a national incident , ' he said			2
' but even after all that 's happened i do n't regret getting @entity142			0
' i have always worked			0
i have paid my tax and @entity178 and i have never claimed benefits			0
' @entity132 has now enlisted the services of pr guru @entity181 , who has often brokered lucrative deals between celebrities and newspapers in the past			0
he and mr @entity134 live together in a rented £ 220,000 flat and are intending to enter into a civil partnership in may or june next year .			0
