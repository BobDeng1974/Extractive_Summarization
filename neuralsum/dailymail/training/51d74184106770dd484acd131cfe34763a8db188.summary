by @entity0 published : 19:00 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 19:00 est , 21 june 2013 fears : defence secretary @entity2 says the army will be ' tied by health and safety ' @entity7 troops could be prevented from carrying out vital missions after an explosive human rights ruling , the @entity2 has warned			1
@entity2 said the judgment means military chiefs will be ‘ living in fear ’ of being sued			1
he fears our forces risk being reduced to @entity16 - style peacekeeping roles – which see some countries refuse to let their personnel go out after dark – after judges decreed that the @entity20 applies on the battlefield			1
mr @entity2 is understood to be so furious at the @entity23 ruling that he is considering demanding a revocation and believes it strengthens the case for @entity7 quitting the @entity20			1
the defence secretary told the @entity28 : ‘ there are real concerns that @entity7 troops could be prevented from carrying out their missions for fear of falling foul of human rights legislation			1
we ca n’t have troop commanders living in fear of how lawyers back in @entity38 might interpret their battlefield decisions that are vital to protecting our national security			0
‘ there could be serious implications for our ability to work with international partners who are not bound by the @entity20			2
’ following the @entity23 ruling that the @entity20 does apply even in combat situations , mr @entity2 has ordered a review of the implications for military commanders and troops			1
the prospect of ‘ health and safety ’ type laws applying to the battlefield could seriously impact on @entity7 ’s military capability , he said			1
flood of litigation : defence officials fear there will be endless compensation demands and curbs on military capability a source added : ‘ if the @entity20 applies to personnel on operations it is feared that commanders may be reluctant to make decisions in the field that will then be second - guessed by lawyers in @entity38			1
‘ we do n’t want to be tied up by health and safety rules that prevent troops patrolling at night or only with certain equipment			2
’ ministers have also asked officials to reassure worried international counterparts that the @entity7 will continue to be a committed and effective partner on combined missions			0
earlier this week , families of some @entity7 soldiers killed or injured fighting in @entity84 were given the go - ahead to bring compensation claims against the government			0
the @entity23 ruled that cases of troops killed while driving @entity90 could be brought under the ‘ right to life ’ enshrined in article two of the @entity20 , potentially outlawing the future deployment of troops with outdated equipment			2
it also ruled that families of soldiers killed by ‘ friendly fire ’ from @entity99 tanks could sue for negligence because the traditional doctrine of combat immunity should not cover decisions ‘ far removed from active operations against the enemy ’			0
@entity106 , mother of private @entity107 , 21 , of @entity108 , @entity109 , who died in july 2005 after a @entity110 was blown up , said it meant soldiers could no longer be treated as ‘ sub-human with no rights ’			0
but defence officials now fear they could face a huge bill from a flood of litigation			2
conservative mp @entity118 , a lawyer who has campaigned for reform of human rights law , said : ‘ this week ’s novel ruling by the @entity23 – stretching the @entity122 to allow soldiers to sue the government over decisions on equipment , training and operations – will endanger our forces and undermine democratic accountability			0
‘ the government should be held accountable if it puts soldiers at unnecessary risk			0
’ but he added : ‘ a surge of litigation risks diverting the very money that should be spent on training , equipment and care			0
what happens if troops are caught off - guard or stretched thin ? ’ colonel @entity142 , former head of @entity7 forces in @entity144 , said : ‘ we can not allow a constricting health and safety culture to creep in and prevent the vital job our soldiers do			0
