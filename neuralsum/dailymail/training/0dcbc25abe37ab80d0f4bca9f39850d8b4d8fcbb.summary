by @entity0 @entity1 : former home secretary @entity2 has revealed that he is ' pessimistic ' about the @entity4 ¿ s chances at the next general election fears that @entity7 could be leading @entity4 to defeat against @entity8 were last night raised by one of the party ’s most influential figures			1
former home secretary @entity2 revealed that he was ‘ pessimistic ’ about the party ’s chances at the next general election			1
in an interview with @entity17 newspaper @entity16 , mr @entity2 warned : ‘ i do n’t think the @entity18 is doing very well at the moment			2
’ the blunt warning will chime with the private fears of many @entity22 who feel their party should be much further ahead of the @entity25 in the polls			0
without mentioning the @entity4 leader by name , mr @entity2 – who backed mr @entity7 ’s brother @entity29 in his leadership bid – laid bare his concerns mr @entity8 could cling on in @entity32			2
the former @entity34 mp said he did not think @entity4 was in a ‘ very good state of affairs ’ and hinted many colleagues were too optimistic about the outcome of the next election			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ i ’m pessimistic from a @entity4 point of view , more pessimistic than i think many in @entity4 are			1
’ warning his party had to do more to ‘ earn respect ’ , the former @entity42 heavyweight insisted the economy would determine the outcome of the 2015 contest			0
but he suggested the @entity48 had wrongly succeeded in blaming the economic downturn entirely on @entity4			1
he said : ‘ i think the government has succeeded with the – in my view , completely false – assertion that [ the downturn ] was all the fault of @entity4			1
but i do n’t think we contested it in the first few months , and i ’m not even sure we ’re really contesting it effectively now			0
' therefore the [ @entity61 ] argument that says : “ we ’ve inherited this mess , we are certainly making progress			0
do you really want @entity4 to come back in ? ” – is going to be a very powerful argument			2
’ the remarks come two years after he raised doubts about the ‘ coherence ’ of mr @entity7 ’s message to @entity4 ’s 2011 party conference and warned mr @entity7 had a ‘ long way to go ’			2
he said then : ‘ i did n’t think there was coherence , let ’s put it politely , in what @entity7 was saying and the main job for the new team is to get a coherent set of policy propositions			0
’ two eds : mr @entity2 's comments follow polls showing the public has more trust in @entity8 and @entity85 to steer the country back to health than they do in the @entity4 counterparts @entity7 and @entity90 mr @entity2 ’s intervention comes amid mounting doubts among @entity22 that shadow chancellor @entity90 is the man to persuade voters to let @entity4 get their hands on the economy again			1
it also follows polling evidence the public has more trust in mr @entity8 and chancellor @entity85 to steer the country back to health than they do in mr @entity7 and mr @entity90			0
one labour mp said : ‘ two years ago , @entity2 was n’t convinced that @entity7 was the man to take us back into power			0
it looks as though he has n’t really changed his mind			0
