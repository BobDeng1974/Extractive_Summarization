these are the forgotten relics of a @entity2 dream , all in dire need of @entity4 's help - they were created in his honour after all			2
once bustling beacons of festive cheer , these ' @entity4 lands ' now lie derelict after the elves went home and the laughter stopped			0
now mould creeps up the grotto 's walls and @entity4 's sleigh lies empty , fused to the earth by rust and moss			0
from @entity21 to @entity22 , they went out of business after failing to attract enough visitors all the year round , in a painful lesson to their once - merry owners on why it ca n't be @entity2 every day			1
goodbye @entity2 : @entity4 appears to cry tears of mould on this swing in @entity30 in @entity22 gone - under land : this is an eerie reminder of how even @entity2 has its hard times overgrown : @entity30 was reportedly conceived in 2000 and was intended to be the largest tourist entertainment attractions in @entity22 - the size of 460 football fields reindeer oh dear : but the park shut down after its owner , @entity38 , who had previously run for mayor of @entity40 , was struck and killed on the highway near the complex in 2004 @entity43 plans : also in the works were other projects including a @entity46 , a western city , a rustic little farm , a ship - hotel , a concert hall and a ten - story tower down the pan : the water slide at @entity30 has dried up and is caked in dirt in the park which is surrounded by picturesque mountains the once busy theme parks are now deserted , their happy @entity2 jingles replaced by whistling winds and rustling leaves			1
they include the 460 - acre @entity30 in @entity22 , which shut down after its owner was killed in a car accident in 2004 , and the town of @entity65 in @entity21 built in 1937 as an attempt to attract buyers to the desert spot			2
@entity69 : @entity70 founded the town of @entity65 in @entity21 , in 1937 as an attempt to attract buyers to the desert location			0
it featured several christmas - themed buildings and visiting children could meet @entity65 at any day of the year vandalised : but the town is now empty and its rides are covered in graffiti all aboard : @entity65 did become a popular tourist destination but no one ever bought land there , and the only people living there were the ones working in the town this is it ! the last gift shops and amusements at @entity65 went out of business in 1995 , leaving a few vandalized buildings , a wishing well , and the ' old 1225 , ' a derailed , pink children 's train covered with graffiti retreat ! now the elves have laft @entity65 , mold creeps up the grotto 's walls and @entity4 's sleigh lies empty , fused to the earth by rust and moss no toys : this was once a toy shop in the centre of @entity65 that was once filled with laughing children famous : one of the places in town that was genuinely successful was its local restaurant , the @entity115 desolate : in the early 1990s , the restaurant offered @entity119 and @entity119 omelette and @entity65 burgers and oil portraits of @entity122 could be purchased from the shops big attraction : @entity125 was a winter - themed amusement park in the @entity127 section of @entity128 , @entity129 , opened in 1955 popular : @entity125 in @entity131 , @entity130 is silent and overgrown			1
during its heyday , between 1959 and 2006 , more than 20 million people passed through the front gates winter woodland : @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity125 in @entity128 , @entity129 , have both been left to rot in the woods			0

these are the abandoned ' @entity143 ' are an eerie reminder of how even @entity2 has its hard times
they are in @entity22 , @entity129 , @entity21 and @entity130 and were all once popular tourist destinations
