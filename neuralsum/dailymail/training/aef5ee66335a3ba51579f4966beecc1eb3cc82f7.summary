by @entity0 heir to @entity1			1
it ’s a mantle that @entity4 naturally ducks , insisting that there will only ever be one sir @entity6 ; for starters , it would be hard to imagine @entity9 building another velodrome in order to honour yet another god of the boards			1
still , @entity4 is @entity9 ’s no. 1 male track rider			1
that ’s an honour to be prized in itself			1
a status that the 21 - year - old seems to carry with some sense of authority			1
he ’s competing in three events at @entity20 – the sprint , team sprint and kerin , the latter complete with moped - riding dr @entity25 figure leading the riders around at ever - increasing speed before a manic finish			1
young star : @entity4 is competing in three events at @entity20 on track : @entity4 , pictured when he was 16 , is expected to impress in @entity32 plans to ride in the lung - bursting , eyeball - popping , strength - sapping kilo were only scratched at the last minute			1
because riding in * four * all - or - nothing events would be just silly , right ? after a fortnight together , @entity4 and his two wing men go in the team sprint on wednesday , each aware that they ’re following in some pretty impressive traditions			1
‘ we ’re lucky to have come through at a time when @entity1 , @entity45 and others have already blazed a trail for @entity9 and @entity49 track cycling , ’ @entity4 , a key member of the @entity40 set - up built in part on the strength of @entity1 , tells @entity43			1
‘ it ’s a real honour to know that we ’re benefiting from the things they did , learning in a system that they helped to develop			1
but that does n’t mean we can ever be compared to someone like @entity6			1
‘ personally , i ’m trying to make a name for myself			2
there is no shortcut in cycling , you simply have to work your way to the top			1
just because you ’re @entity9 or @entity49 , does n’t mean you have some right to win a race			1
with the @entity9 team doing their holding camp in @entity69 , where i ’m based with @entity70 all the time , it ’s been ideal for me			1
‘ we ’ll have had just over two weeks together before the @entity73			1
that should be enough to get us reacquainted with each other , pick the best team – and get ready to compete			1
‘ it ’s been a bit tricky catching up with team @entity9 riders			1
they ’ve all been run off their feet , especially the coaches			2
but i know them all really well			2
‘ the team sprint is going to be exciting , i think			2
we ’ve had some real internal competition for places – which is something that has been missing from the @entity86 squad for four or five years			2
‘ it ’s nothing but a positive to have guys fighting for places because it pushes everybody on			2
personally , my team sprint form is pretty good going into the @entity73			1
’ @entity4 was actually inspired to take up track cycling by watching @entity1 win gold in the kilo at the @entity95 back in 2004 – and , within four years , he ’d won the inaugural @entity1 trophy as reward for an explosive start in the sport			1
legend : sir @entity1 is idolised across @entity49 for his service to cycling role model : @entity104 looks up to fellow @entity105 the @entity107 rider has rarely dropped pace since , despite suffering breathing problems that threatened to prevent him reaching his potential			1
‘ the asthma thing is something i ’ve had problems with recently , ’ he says , adding : ‘ but i ’ve been working with specialists who have managed to come up with a solution			2
‘ there have been times in the past when i ’ve had coughs that drag on and on , two or three weeks at least			2
i ’ve had it from childhood – and , when i was a junior , i took almost a month off because i could n’t shift this cold			2
‘ you get athletes who are always injured , some who always get ill. if you get both , you wo n’t make much progress ! ‘ @entity129 have been very helpful , sending me to a specialist with more qualifications and awards than i could ever remember			2
' he ’s a real respiratory specialist and he ’s been great at solving the problem , to the extent that less than a week after having a chest infection i ’m back to full fitness – that ’s a world away from where i used to be			2
’ training in @entity69 , @entity4 has been winding up his @entity40 mates now representing their own home nations , the intra-squad banter building as the @entity73 have approached			1
anything to gain an edge ? ‘ i am into my sports psychology and , funnily enough , my sports psychologist will be competing at the @entity73 , ’ revealed @entity4			1
‘ he ’s going to be a tandem pilot for @entity149 – @entity150			2
it ’ll be quite funny to see him there			2
i wish him the best and glad he ’s not competing in my event , because he ’ll know all my weaknesses			2
‘ for me , once i get to the start , i am quite content			0
but i concern myself with all the little things you have to do just to get to the start line			0
‘ my warm - up will start an hour or an hour - and - a - half before then , everything is quite carefully done			0
‘ when i ’m on the track , it ’s simple			1
you ride your bike as fast you can , hope it ’s good enough to win			0
‘ as for the rest of the competition , it ’s been a bit more tricky than normal because normally the @entity170 and @entity171 come to the races we – @entity129 – were at in @entity174 recently			0
they ’re considered the @entity175 for sprint cycling			1
‘ you tend to get 60 - odd world class sprinters battling hard all day , until someone finishes on top			0
but the @entity171 and @entity170 both went elsewhere this year			0
‘ you can get quite drawn into worrying about how fast someone else is , what they ’ve been doing here and there – i prefer to focus on my own preparation			0
if a @entity186 did a world - record time , what would i do about it ? it would n’t affect me			0
‘ i go back to the @entity188 , when all the riders were staying in the hotel , all making the classic mistake			0
we ’d see a @entity174 posting on @entity195 that he ’d done an incredible time – and the only basis for it is what he ’s written in those 140 characters			0
‘ there could be nothing behind it at all			0
but he ’s posted it , managed to rattle you a bit – and that was the intention			0
it ’s best to keep your head out of that			0
’ like most team @entity9 competitors , @entity4 has only reached this point thanks to the backing of family – particularly dad @entity216 and mum , @entity217			1
as long as neither of them emulate the on - screen antics of @entity221 , the dad of @entity224 swimmer @entity225 becoming a tv smash with his ‘ unbelievable ’ outburst , @entity4 will be more than happy to give them their due			1
‘ my mum and dad have been through the whole process since day one and , although they ’ll play it down , it ’s massively important for them to be involved in this once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ they probably remember getting me my first bike			0
my mum is the sporty one , she ’ s always been a real help through difficult times			0
‘ she is probably training harder than me at the moment – she works three days a week and does triathlon training the rest of the time			0
she ’s massively into it , really working hard ‘ she keeps giving me updates and it ’s a role reversal from what i used to do : “ i did this time today , it ’s second best in my age category … ” i ’m sending her messages back saying : “ well done			0
” ‘ i remember even when she was working full time , she did a few marathons			0
i got the sporting gene from here , definitely			0
‘ she ’s even been away at a warm - weather training camp , which is the kind of stuff we do			0
she ’s really diving in head first with it			0
‘ my dad is at the opposite end of the spectrum			0
the less activity , the better			0
it ’s quite good to have that contrast , because i can speak to each of them about different aspects of life			0
‘ it ’s great for the parents of			0
my favourite one was the @entity224 dad at the swimming at @entity281			0
my mum could be on tv , no problem – although she would probably want to talk about her triathlon time ! ‘ she might also have some baby photos of me , which could be interesting if she started showing them …			0
