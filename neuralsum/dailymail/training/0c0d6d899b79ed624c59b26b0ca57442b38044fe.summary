it was risk with very little reward			0
@entity3 is so confident of becoming @entity5 's new manager that his team selection dictated that they were dumped out of the @entity8 with a clear eye on more pressing matters			1
the truth is that he may look back on @entity13 's astonishing comeback – including five goals in 19 minutes - and wonder whether they should have really attacked the competition with more vigour			1
the caretaker , who had won five of his eight games in charge before this , is still expected to be announced as @entity24 's successor on thursday and @entity27 's double before half - time had looked to put the @entity28 through to the last eight			1
@entity13 's @entity30 celebrates his fifth and @entity13 's second goal to cap off the comebakck @entity30 beats @entity5 goalkeeper @entity34 as @entity13 score five in 19 minutes caretaker manager @entity3 greets the fans as he receives a warm reception more than 3,000 @entity13 fans travelled to @entity39 for the @entity8 tie @entity5 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity34 6 ; @entity41 5.5 , @entity42 5 , @entity43 6 , @entity44 6.5 ; @entity45 6.5 , @entity46 6.5 ; @entity47 7 ( @entity48 72 - 6 ) , @entity49 6.5 ( @entity50 86 ) , @entity51 6.5 ( @entity52 72 - 6 ) ; @entity27 8 subs not used : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 @entity13 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity59 5.5 ; @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 7 , @entity62 6 , @entity63 5 , @entity64 5.5 ( @entity65 69 - 6 ) , @entity66 7 , @entity67 6.5 ( @entity68 77 - 6 ) ; @entity69 7.5 , @entity30 8.5 ( @entity70 75 - 6 ) , @entity71 7.5 subs not used : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 referee : @entity78 7 but they were shocked by promotion - hunting @entity13 who turned the tie on its head in blistering fashion			1
' it was very disappointing , ' @entity3 reflected			0
it 's a very harsh lesson for the young players			0
there was always the chance that would 've been the case with a young side out			0
i put a team out i expected to win the game			2
i do n't regret it			0
' maybe 90 minutes was a bit too long at that level for some of them			2
i 'd hope we would 've done better			0
' one result does n't hamper my chances			0
' a stunning goal flurry showed just why @entity105 's side top the second tier and are everyone 's tip to be plying their trade in the @entity111 this time next year			2
it was patently obvious that @entity5 were n't overly bothered either way if they managed to progress into the quarter - finals – even though a maximum of six top flight teams will be in the hat after this week 's fourth round ties			1
there were eight home changes here , including a debut for 20 - year - old academy product @entity43			2
even @entity34 – with those trademark grey jogging bottoms – was given an outing			0
the goalkeeper had conceded five in his last game – @entity24 's final hurrah at @entity130 – and it so happened that the fate would befall him again , making it 13 to fly in his net in just three games for the club			0
@entity27 of @entity5 celebrates after opening the scoring at @entity39 @entity27 scores his second goal to give @entity5 a comfortable lead in the @entity139 tie @entity27 runs towards the home crowd to celebrate his double on tuesday night @entity71 scores from the penalty spot as @entity13 narrow the deficit before half time @entity13 skipper @entity61 manhandled @entity43 from a corner but the @entity5 defender wriggled free and almost powered the hosts ahead			1
the hosts had set about creating the same sort of tempo with which they have excelled since @entity3 took over @entity24 's disjointed mess last month , as @entity27 bent a wicked effort straight into @entity59 ' midriff before being brilliant foiled when clean through			1
@entity27 was n't to be denied for long however ; the striker , who had n't scored this season , intercepted @entity63 's ludicrously lapse back pass to round @entity59 and slip home the opener in the 27th minute			1
more confusion at the back for @entity13 – @entity64 the culprit - allowed @entity27 to comfortably slot in his second			1
@entity69 was excellently thwarted by @entity34 's legs as they tried to prevent consecutive defeats for the first time this season			0
that they did , and in some style			0
@entity173 's reckless handball set the ball rolling , meaning @entity71 emphatically halved the deficit from the spot			2
the inexperience of @entity5 's youthful side told seconds after the restart as @entity30 ' pull - back from the byline was diverted into @entity69 's path and he hammered an equaliser past @entity34 in front of 3,000 travelling fans			1
that healthy contingent went wild nine minutes later when @entity30 sauntered in from the left and smashed beyond the @entity188 to complete an astonishing comeback			2
@entity190 of @entity13 levels the score with a strike shortly after half time @entity69 celebrates the goal that triggered @entity13 's comeback @entity30 scores his first goal to put @entity13 ahead against @entity5 for the first time ' we played like ourselves second half , ' @entity105 beamed			1
the @entity202 were n't finished there – not by a long shot			2
@entity13 were rampant and @entity205 midfielder @entity66 thundered in the fourth from close range with @entity5 now all over the place			1
home fans began to leave by the time @entity30 sumptuously flicked past the bystanding @entity34 from @entity69 's clever centre , and you could n't blame them			1
what @entity3 may be privately pondering though is whether he made the right call by taking such a brazen approach to this			0
owner @entity216 is highly unlikely to have a last - gasp change of heart – he 'd be folly to – but the presumed next incumbent has n't done himself any favours			0
@entity105 – who had invited @entity3 to study his work at @entity222 while completing a @entity223 - wisely added : ' if they do n't give kit the job tomorrow i 'd be very surprised			0
' @entity30 celebrates the goal that put the visitors 3 - 2 up in the capital @entity66 of @entity13 scores in the second half as his side launch an inspired comeback			1

@entity27 scored a double to put @entity5 ahead at half time
@entity71 and @entity190 scored to level the score for @entity13
@entity66 and @entity30 ( 2 ) sealed the *victory* for the @entity202
derby progress through to the @entity8 quarter - finals
