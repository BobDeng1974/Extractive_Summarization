by @entity0 published : 18:10 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 01:45 est , 18 september 2013 dr @entity1 claims that compassion is ' not a necessary component ' of healthcare nurses and doctors do not need to treat patients with compassion , a controversial academic has claimed			1
dr @entity1 thinks staff should be able to carry out daily tasks – from removing someone ’s appendix to feeding an elderly patient – without feeling any kindness towards them			1
she argued that compassion ‘ is not a necessary component ’ of healthcare and that staff who care too much about their patients would become demoralised if they witness neglect or poor treatment on wards			1
the standard of @entity28 care is currently under intense scrutiny after a series of damning reports exposed appalling neglect at some hospitals and care homes			1
health secretary @entity35 has implied such poor care is partly down to a lack of compassion among staff and has warned that a ‘ culture of cruelty ’ existed in certain organisations			1
in march , mr @entity35 called for all student nurses to spend a year on wards carrying out basic tasks to prove they are capable of caring			2
he also wants staff pay to be linked to levels of kindness			0
but dr @entity1 – who lectures on ethics at the @entity52 , in @entity53 – believes that compassion will not solve any problems in the @entity28			1
dr @entity1 claims doctors and nurses should be able to carry out everyday tasks - from removing someone 's appendix to feeding an elderly patient - without feeling any kindness towards them ( file pic ) writing in the journal @entity65 , she said : ‘ compassion is not a necessary component of healthcare , since the crucial tasks associated with healthcare can be carried out in the absence of compassion			1
‘ one can remove an appendix without caring about the person it is taken from , empty a bedpan without caring about the patient who has filled it , or provide food without caring about the person who will eat it			0
health secretary @entity35 has claimed the poor standard of @entity28 care is partly down to a lack of compassion among staff			1
he has warned that a ' culture of cruelty ' exists in certain organisations ‘ unless we regard healthcare professionals as saints , we can not demand that they guarantee an unlimited flow of compassion for each patient			2
indeed , it is not only unfair , but dangerous to do so			0
’ she went on to say that those ‘ who feel compassion ’ may become ‘ deeply distressed ’ if they witness poor care on wards , adding : ‘ for this reason , the compassionate healthcare worker may be at risk of suffering burnout , fatigue , becoming desensitised , damaged and ultimately dangerous in the healthcare system			2
’ a @entity110 spokesman disputed dr @entity1 ’s remarks yesterday , saying : ‘ compassion is a vital element of good patient care			1
many nurses represent @entity28 values at their finest and we let them down when poor care is not tackled			2
’ and dr @entity118 , chief executive of the @entity119 said : ‘ there are many factors which impact on the quality of care patients receive and compassion will always play a crucial role in nursing			2
’ dr @entity1 is an expert on controversial topics in health and science including @entity131 , egg donation and cloning			1
last year she called for children to be created in artificial wombs in labs – as she claimed it was unfair that only women went through the pain and suffering of childbirth			0
hospitals should put up signs saying how many nurses are working on wards to combat concerns about unsafe staffing levels , mps have suggested			0
a report from the health select committee said hospital managers should follow the example set by @entity152 in @entity153 , where the signs have been used since may			0
they want every ward to have a whiteboard saying how many nurses should be on duty , the number of nurses on shift at the time as well as the number scheduled to work overnight			0
this would alert relatives , patients and healthcare professionals to potentially dangerous staffing levels , allowing them to demand hospital bosses bring more nurses on shift			0
committee chairman and @entity172 mp @entity170 said : ‘ if we get to the point where there are several people challenging this rather than nobody challenging then we have made some progress			0
‘ what i would say is look at what they do in @entity184			0
it ’s the whole issue in the health service about recognising good practice and either doing it that way or finding a better way of delivering the same result			0
