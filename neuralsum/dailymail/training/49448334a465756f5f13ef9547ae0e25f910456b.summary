@entity19 claims he was short - changed by @entity0 for organising hit men to kill the @entity68 engineer , which the businessman had ordered to be disguised as a carjacking			1
the film , taken from a variety of locations around the @entity34 hotel , begins with @entity0 walking back from a shopping trip to the nearby @entity45 , a small white plastic bag swinging from his hand			2

he is accompanied by a police officer who is carrying a newspaper splashed with news of @entity21 's murder read all about it : @entity0 immediately snatches up the broadsheet and is seen scanning the front page time to go : @entity0 apparently gets the message from @entity19 that he 's arriving at the hotel @entity0 , unshaven and wearing jeans , is shown carrying the small white bag and his laptop and settling down on a leather sofa in a quiet seating area of the hotel 's closed - in terrace			1
the bag which came with the packet of greeting cards , is now holding the the money for @entity19 , the court heard			2
at one point , @entity0 looks behind him and up at the cctv camera in the corner of the room			0
earlier , @entity19 told the trial that he had warned @entity58 about the security camera as they met the morning after the township carjacking			1
they were waiting to hear news of mrs @entity58 , who had been driven off in the back of @entity19 's taxi by two armed men , after the driver and @entity0 had both been released unharmed			1
as @entity0 sits peering between the screens of his laptop and phone , @entity19 – who claims he was recruited by the newlywed to organise his bride 's murder within minutes of dropping them at the hotel four days before – is seen on another camera making his way to get his payment , dressed from head to toe in white			1
one of the empty leather chairs opposite @entity0 is then filled by mr @entity99 , 65 , who is accompanied by a police officer carrying a paper emblazoned with news of mrs @entity58 's murder			1
@entity0 immediately snatches up the broadsheet and is seen scanning the front page , which shows a picture of the blood - smeared car from which her body was recovered			2
shortly after @entity0 is seen looking at his lit - up phone – @entity19 messages to say he is nearby , the court was told – and stands up and leaves the room , the small bag of money is in his hand			1
he passes captain @entity185 who comes through the door - he was the first detective to investigate mrs @entity58 's murder , and was by this point the liaison officer for the grieving family as they prepare to fly her body home			2
on his way : @entity19 is seen on camera walking towards the main entrance of the @entity34 hotel entering the complex : he strolls up to the glass doors , which are opened for him by a doorman a security camera in the lobby picks up the familiar figure of @entity0 , in collared shirt , as he waits and paces while @entity19 walks through the car park , just seconds away			1
as he comes through the imposing glass entrance , @entity0 turns and walk off briskly , indicating that the driver should follow			0
in his testimony @entity19 told the court , ' i saw the gentleman standing there			0
he was just standing at the beginning of the passage			0
he signalled me to follow him			0
' the two men are seen heading down a deserted corridor and through the door of the hotel 's small business centre , where they met for 90 seconds in private , away from any cameras			0
@entity19 is seen leaving the room , his pocket bulging with the bag , and disappearing into a hotel lavatory - where he began to count the money			0
he told the court he had been expecting to get @entity232 , 000 ( approximately £ 260 pounds ) , for recruiting the hit men and driving mrs @entity58 into danger			0
he said : ' i counted the money inside			0
there was only 1,000 @entity236 [ £ 65 ]			0
i put it in my back pocket			0
' waiting : @entity0 is seen pacing back and forth in the hotel lobby in the moments before @entity19 appears follow me : @entity0 leads the way as he takes the cab driver to a part of the hotel which is not covered by @entity3 paid , but apparently not in full ... @entity19 leaves			1
he says @entity0 paid him @entity60 , 000 , a quarter of what he expected @entity0 is then shown returning to his room upstairs , briefly , and comes back down the corridor with a large notebook – perhaps to use its retrieval as the cover for his absence - and re-joins his father - in - law and captain @entity185 downstairs			0
he has been away for nearly seven minutes – but captain @entity185 shook his head and replied , ' no , he said nothing , ' when asked by prosecutor @entity258 if @entity0 had said where he had been been			0
@entity19 was not a suspect in the carjacking by that point , the officer confirmed to the court			0
@entity0 resumes his position in the leather sofa , opposite his father in law , and draws his computer on his lap to type			0
for most of the sequence , with the officer next to him busy with newspapers and police paperwork , mr @entity99 sits entirely motionless , his head resting on his hands , his eyes staring at his lap. the body language between mrs @entity58 's husband and father could not be more conflicting			2
during the entire sequence , the two men are seen to exchange hardly a word			0
one last errand : @entity0 is next seen returning to his room at the hotel just had to get this ... he re-emerges from the room with a large notebook @entity291 : @entity0 carries the notebook back through the hotel 's lavish surroundings mourning : he re-enters the enclosed terrace where his father - in - law is waiting , head in hand , sitting next to local police officer captain @entity185 who was acting as the liaison officer for the family keeping busy : @entity0 fiddles with his laptop and phone as mr @entity99 stays into space blankly @entity0 , his father , and mr @entity99 left @entity305 the following day , accompanying mrs @entity58 's body			1
three days later , @entity19 confessed to his part in her murder , implicating her new husband as the chief conspirator in the plot			2
the driver turned state witness and told police how he had recruited two hitmen to help him stage a carjacking as the cover for the killing – a strategy allegedly devised by @entity0			0
@entity19 was sentenced to 18 years for murder , hitman @entity321 who confessed to his part was jailed for 25 years and @entity322 was convicted of murder following a trial and also jailed for 25 years , but died last month from a brain tumour			1
@entity326 is currently giving evidence against @entity0 - he was a ' middle man ' tasked by @entity19 with recruiting the killers and spared prosecution in return for giving evidence at @entity322 's trial			1
he now faces prosecution following @entity0 's hearing , unless judge @entity335 is persuaded that his immunity should be extended			0
