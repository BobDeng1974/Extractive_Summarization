musician : talented violinist @entity1 said she wanted to protest against @entity2 and miming on television the violinist who pelted @entity2 with eggs in the live final of @entity7 ’s @entity6 explained her actions yesterday			1
@entity1 said she was protesting at both his domination of the music industry and performers miming on television			1
but in turn , she was accused of targeting the music mogul during saturday ’s show as part of a publicity stunt to raise her profile			1
millions of viewers saw the 30 - year - old musician , a bafta - nominated composer , walk to the front of the stage carrying a box of eggs , as singers @entity27 and @entity28 were performing			2
with a wide grin , she then began hurling eggs at @entity2 , 53			1
miss @entity1 , described as an ‘ upstanding young woman ’ by her mother , has claimed she was venting her anger after apparently being asked to pretend to play her violin			0
the ex-grammar school pupil , who has a masters degree from @entity37 , was one of a number of backing musicians and singers asked to perform when the @entity42 brothers were on stage			0
she told the @entity44 : ‘ i took a stand against people miming on television and against @entity2 and against his influence on the music industry			1
’ however while @entity2 appeared to take the incident in good humour , he is said to have been ' absolutely furious ' off camera after the safety of himself and his panel was called into doubt			1
a source told the @entity59 newspaper : ' during the break , @entity2 stormed backstage and told one producer that she could have had a gun			1
he was n't so bothered about having been hit by an egg but he was furious that the welfare of not only the judges but also the contestants and the audience could have been at risk			2
' however , following the incident , some critics took to @entity72 to accuse @entity73 of a publicity stunt			1
and her friends admitted it was not a spontaneous protest and that she had discussed in advance how she might draw attention to the issue of miming on the show			2
she had even said that one way to do this might have been to smash her violin during the performance			0
one said : ‘ @entity86 only knows how she managed to smuggle half a dozen eggs on to the stage			2
' normally if you are a woman playing , all you are allowed to take with you is a small clutch bag , or something similar			0
not something big enough to fit a box of eggs inside			2
a source told @entity109 : ' there was one very surreal moment when she started going on about the fact the eggs were organic and from @entity113			2
it was like that made everything all right			0
' miss @entity1 has since apologised , but her boyfriend @entity97 said : ‘ @entity7 ’s @entity6 basically pressured her into apologising so they would n’t press charges			0
she had to say it was a silly thing to do when really she does n’t think it was			0
‘ she objects to those kind of shows and to @entity2 and what he represents to the music industry			1
she ’s not after personal publicity , she just wanted to make a point			0
’ miss @entity1 did not leave her flat in @entity130 yesterday , where she lives with her boyfriend , 39			0
escorted away : miss @entity1 was taken off stage by security after throwing the eggs @entity135 : miss @entity1 picked out @entity2 as she wanted to make a point about his dominance of the music industry there have been suggestions she may have targeted @entity2 as revenge after she auditioned for @entity7 ’s @entity6 in 2012 with string quartet @entity142 , who performed with @entity145 at the @entity147 closing ceremony			1
the group got through the first round but were axed before the live shows , prompting an angry internet blog post saying : ‘ so @entity142 went on @entity152			1
’ miss @entity1 was defended by her mother @entity154 , 62 , who lives in a large detached cottage in the village of @entity157 , near @entity158 , @entity159 , with her husband @entity160 , 70			0
it 's no yolk : @entity2 had to remove his jacket after it was hit but he still had some egg on his shirt angry : @entity165 was less than impressed with the stunt during the final of @entity7 's @entity6 she said : ‘ we are not @entity7 ’s @entity6 watchers , so we do n’t know what all the fuss is about , except i know there ’s a lot of strong feeling about @entity2 and his influence on the music industry			1
he does monopolise things , does n’t he ? ‘ i suppose the big point is that you have got all those people at the front and the people who really know about music are sitting at the back miming			1
i think @entity1 feels quite strongly about live music being live			2
’ miss @entity1 's uncle @entity186 , who lives in @entity187 , said : ' unfortunately for her , it gave the impression she was a bit of a nutter - which , believe me , she 's not			0
' i thought it was some kind of prank the show had got her to do to make it more interesting			0
' a @entity152 spokesman said miming was ‘ standard industry practice for backing musicians during tv performances as it is n’t possible to easily capture the quality of the sound in a live broadcast environment			1
all contestants on @entity7 ’s @entity6 sing live			0
’ all together : @entity1 pictured with the rest of her band , who auditioned for @entity7 's @entity6 last year @entity208 : shortly after the end of the show @entity1 apologised for her actions			0
