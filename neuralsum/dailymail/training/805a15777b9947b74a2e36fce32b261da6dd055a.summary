by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 12:42 est , 17 january 2013 it appears that friends who @entity3 together , stay together , as two of the women linked to @entity7 ’s infamous sex parties were seen lingerie shopping together earlier today			1
@entity9 and @entity10 tried on a number of lacy outfits in what appears to be an agent provocateur store in central @entity15 , parading in barely - there threads in full view of passers by			1
the girls were pictured on the same day as an @entity21 court agreed to postpone @entity7 ’s wiretap leaks trial until after the february national election in which he is a prime ministerial candidate			0
new man : it appears @entity7 's girls have moved on to another leader as they sport @entity30 t - shirts before trying on lingerie @entity9 and @entity10 ’s shopping trip saw them flaunt their bodies in black underwear and reach for various erotic toys , including a rhinestone - encrusted whip			1
as well as the corsets and knickers the girls also , somewhat bizarrely , went for a pair of @entity30 t - shirts			0
both girls were among the 30 - odd women who appeared in court documents as authorities investigated @entity7 ’s sleazy parties in 2011 , and have also been connected to him prior to the probe			0
ms @entity9 began her ‘ career ’ in a reality - tv show on @entity7 ’s television network after which she is alleged to have stayed in a @entity15 apartment belonging to the former @entity21 pm in exchange for attending his ‘ @entity3 ’ parties			1
pairing up : @entity9 struts her stuff in a corset as she helps her friend and fellow @entity3 - girl @entity10 in the changing room @entity7 's girls : @entity9 and @entity10 , @entity21 television stars famous for attending @entity7 's @entity3 parties shop for underwear full view : @entity9 , left , and @entity10 , right , made little effort to cover their behinds @entity69 : the unabashed ladies tried on several outfits whist perusing the other items on offer in the store the 32 - year - old model and showgirl was first linked to @entity7 in july 2009 , when she was said to have stayed at a health centre in november 2008 , where @entity7 was treated for back pain			1
as for weather girl @entity10 , 27 , bank records uncovered by @entity21 prosecutors in january 2011 showed that @entity7 paid her more than £ 100,000 for attending his infamous sex parties - money disguised as a ' non-interest - earning loan ' paid to ' help with studies '			2
the payments started in 2010 and averaged £ 8,500 a month – a figure ms @entity10 refers to in a text message to mr @entity7 ’s aide , @entity90 , which read : ‘ may i urgently remind you of the 10,000 euro bank transfer			0

prosecutors have asked for a one - year jail sentence for @entity7 for his alleged role in the publication of wiretap transcripts in a newspaper owned by his media empire and three years for his brother @entity117 , the publisher of @entity15 newspaper @entity118			2
the ruling was in contrast to the decision by another court , which rejected @entity7 's bid to halt his sex - for - hire trial			2
