onscreen gambler : @entity6 played an online casino mogul last year in @entity130 opposite @entity142 card counting is a controversial strategy in blackjack used to determine whether the next hand is likely to give a probable advantage to the player or the dealer			1
while the practice , first outlined by @entity153 mathematician dr. @entity152 in his seminal 1962 book beat the dealer , is not illegal , it is highly frowned upon in the gaming industry			0
getting caught keeping a tally on card values could get you booted from @entity4 , but in @entity162 's @entity161 it is illegal for casinos to bar card counters			0
gamblers who resort to counting cards in a bid to get an edge over the casino do so by keeping a running tally of all high and low valued cards seen by the player			2
card counting , or card reading as it is also known , allows players to bet more money with less risk when the count gives an advantage , like with a high concentration of aces and 10s in the deck			0
it also minimizes losses when the count is unfavorable to the player , which happens when there are many low cards - 4s , 5s and 6s - in the deck , which benefits the house			2
it is a common misconception that card counters must possess savant - like mental abilities or photographic memory like the character @entity197 portrayed by @entity198 in the movie @entity197			2
instead of counting and memorizing each card , card counters assign a point score to each card they see that estimates the value of that card			0
the players then track the sum of these values by keeping a ' running count ' - a tally			2
basic card counting , known as the @entity213 system , assigns a positive , negative , or zero value to each card value available			0
when a card of that value is dealt , the count is adjusted by that card 's counting value			0
low cards increase the count as they increase the percentage of high cards in the remaining deck , while high cards decrease			0
for example , the @entity213 system subtracts one for each dealt ten , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 or @entity228 , and adds one for any value from 2 to 6			0
values between 7 and 9 are assigned a value of zero and have no impact on the count			0
the higher the count , the more players should bet because they have a greater chance of hitting a blackjack with many aces and 10s left in the deck .			0
