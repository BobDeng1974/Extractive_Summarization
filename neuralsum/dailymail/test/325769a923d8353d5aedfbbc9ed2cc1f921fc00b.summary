@entity0 has dismissed reports linking @entity3 forward @entity2 with @entity4 as a potential replacement for the former @entity7 international or his team - mate @entity8			1
@entity9 , who spent his two years at @entity10 largely on loan before joining the second - placed @entity13 club , has scored nine goals this season and is topping the league 's assist charts with 16 – seven more than the next best			1
but @entity0 says despite his impressive form the 23 - year - old @entity18 is the wrong style of player to come in under @entity22 because he has different assets to himself and the @entity25 winger			1
@entity2 is linked with @entity4 as a potential replacement for the club 's veteran forwards the @entity3 playmaker , here in action for @entity30 against @entity31 , has 16 assists and nine goals this season @entity4 's @entity0 says despite @entity9 's impressive form he is the wrong type of player for @entity38 ' he is not a player who takes the ball and dribbles forward and likes to have the opponents in front of him , ' @entity0 told @entity46 publication @entity44			1
' @entity9 is great , when he fits the counterattack			0
at @entity4 , however , you usually only have three or four metres in front of you , not a lot of room			0
but he is a good player and he is still young , so he can still learn			0
' @entity0 and @entity8 's contracts run out in 2017 and both have endured injuries worries of late prompting reports that an injection of youth such as 23 - year - old @entity9 could be good for the club			2
@entity0 ( left ) says @entity9 's counter-attacking skills do n't mesh with the style of @entity22 ( right ) @entity0 has struggled with injuries of late and has been linked with moves away from the @entity13 leaders should @entity4 be in the market for a young attacker , however , @entity0 knows precisely who he 'd want to see at @entity67 – @entity9 's @entity18 team - mate @entity68			1
' he attacks all of the time			0
he loves to run at his opponent , ' he said			0
' but he plays at @entity10 - this could be very expensive for @entity4			2
' if @entity4 do go for @entity9 , against their outspoken veteran 's advice , they 'll have competition from @entity76 , who have met with his representatives , along with @entity79			2
@entity3 are said to be keen to hang onto him for at least one more campaign that should include next season 's @entity81			0
@entity10 's @entity68 would be an ideal fit with @entity22 and the @entity67 , says @entity0 , but expensive			1
