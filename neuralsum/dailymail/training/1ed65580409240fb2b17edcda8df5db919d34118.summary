by @entity0 last updated at 11:53 am on 2nd march 2012 the @entity2 matador who lost his left eye in a horrific goring will make a remarkable return to the ring this weekend - wearing an eye patch			1
@entity8 , now dubbed ' the pirate ' , will risk life and limb just five months after he was seen hobbling from a @entity12 ring covered in blood screaming ' i ca n't see '			1
although he says he is ' fully prepared ' , he has admitted there will be an added element of danger - as he will not see the bull whenever it brushes past him on his blind left side			1
scroll down to see the goring ... back in business : @entity8 returns to the ring on sunday , just five months after he lost his left eye in a horrific goring now and then : @entity8 pictured ( left ) in november , and before the goring ( right ) in 2009 @entity27 , 38 , was wounded in october after he slipped on the sand , a bull 's horn pierced his jaw and it came out through his eye			1
the crowds at the @entity12 's @entity32 bullfight at the @entity34 ring were left stunned			2

fateful fall : mr @entity8 slips as he turns around from the ball and falls to the floor , giving the bull the chance to strike pierced : the bull takes its revenge on mr @entity8 by goring him through his jaw as he lies helplessly on the ground after : with blood gushing from his face , and his assistants distracting the bull , mr @entity8 is helped from the ring in 2001 the @entity91 native suffered serious injuries to his neck during a fight in @entity95			2
