by @entity0 you promise ' in sickness and in health , ' but a new poll shows becoming a caregiver to a frail spouse causes more stress than having to care for mom , dad or even the in - laws			1
@entity11 40 and older say they count on their families to care for them as they age , with good reason : half of them already have been caregivers to relatives or friends , the poll found			1
but neither the graying population nor the loved ones who expect to help them are doing much planning for long - term care			1
in fact , people are far more likely to disclose their funeral plans to friends and family than reveal their preferences for assistance with day - to - day living as they get older , according to the poll by @entity0 - @entity33 for @entity34			2
challenging : in this august 30 , 2013 photo , @entity35 cares for her husband @entity37 at their home in @entity41 , @entity42			0
@entity37 was diagnosed with @entity43 in 1978			0
a new poll reveals it 's more stressful to care for a spouse than a parent and while 8 in 10 people who 've been caregivers called it a positive experience , it 's also incredibly difficult			1
life as you know it becomes different , ' said @entity56 , 62 , of @entity57 , who retired early in part to spend time with his wife , @entity60			0
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 15 years ago , her mobility has deteriorated enough that she now uses a wheelchair			0
@entity56 , a former business manager for an oil company , said he has felt stress , frustration and , at times , anger			0
' the traditional vows are through sickness and health , for richer or poorer , for better or worse , etc. , ' he said			0
' at the age of 25 and 32 , you say those things and you 're high on love and healthy , and life is all in front of you			1
the meanings of those words are pretty much lost , even when you concentrate on them			0
' still , he said caregiving has strengthened his marriage commitment in ways he could n't foresee as a newlywed nearly 37 years ago			0
caregiving may start with driving a loved one to the doctor or helping with household chores , but progress to hands - on care , such as bathing			1
increasingly , family members are handling tasks once left to nurses , such as the care of open wounds or injections of medication			1
with a rapidly aging population , more families will face those responsibilities : government figures show nearly 7 in 10 @entity11 will need long - term care at some point after they reach age 65			1
yet just 20 per cent of those surveyed think it is likely they will need such care someday			1
almost twice as many , 39 per cent , are deeply concerned about burdening their families			1
contrary to popular belief , @entity114 does n't pay for the most common types of long - term care — and last year , a bipartisan commission appointed by @entity119 could n't agree on how to finance those services , either			1
but the @entity0 - @entity33 poll found nearly 6 in 10 @entity11 40 and older support some type of government - administered long - term care insurance program , a 7 - point increase from last year 's @entity0 survey			1
the poll also found broad support for a range of policy proposals : — more than three - fourths favor tax breaks to encourage saving for long - term care or for purchasing long - term care insurance			1
only a third favor a requirement to purchase such coverage			0
— some 8 in 10 want more access to community services that help the elderly live independently			2
— more than 70 per cent support respite care programs for family caregivers and letting people take time off work or adjust their schedules to accommodate caregiving			1
— two - thirds want a caregiver designated on their loved one 's medical charts who must be included in all discussions about care			1
@entity155 this month became the first state to pass the @entity158 - pushed @entity157 ( @entity160 ) act that requires hospitals to notify a family caregiver when a loved one is being discharged and to help prepare that caregiver for nursing the patient at home			2
just 30 per cent in this age group who say they 'll likely care for a loved one in the next five years feel prepared to do so			1
women tend to live longer than men and consequently most family caregivers , 41 per cent , assist a mother			2
seventeen per cent have cared for a father , and 14 per cent have cared for a spouse or partner , the poll found			2
the tug on the sandwich generation — middle - aged people caring for both children and older parents , often while holding down a job — has been well - documented , and the new poll found half of all caregivers report the experience caused stress in the family			0
but spouses were most likely to report that stress and to say caregiving weakened their relationship with their partner and burdened their finances			0
spouses are more likely to handle complex care tasks , on duty 24 - 7 with less help from family and friends , said @entity202 , a caregiving specialist at @entity158			2
physically , that can be harder because spouse caregivers tend to be older : in the @entity0 - @entity33 poll , the average age of spouse caregivers was 67 , compared with 58 for people who 've cared for a parent			2
@entity210 , 79 , of @entity211 , @entity212 , cared for her husband , @entity213 , for nearly five years while he suffered dementia and @entity216 's syndrome , care that eventually required feeding , dressing and diapering him			2
' i think i loved him more after i started caring for him			0
i saw what a wonderful person he was : his ( positive ) attitude , his kindness , his acceptance of things , ' she said			0
but he lived his last 11 months in a nursing home because ' i could n't handle him anymore , ' @entity210 said			0
' he was too big for me			0
he was as helpless as a baby			0
' the @entity0 - @entity33 survey was conducted by telephone march 13 to april 23 among a random national sample of 1,419 adults age 40 or older , with funding from the @entity232			2
results for the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points .			0

seven in 10 @entity11 will need assisted care after the age of 65 but only 20 per cent surveyed think they will need a caregiver
