by @entity0 age need be no barrier to success			2
at either end of the spectrum			2
@entity7 ’s women – well , one woman , one girl – demonstrated the inadequacy of a birth certificate as a judge of anyone ’s athletic ability on another rousing night at @entity15			1
first para sport swimmer @entity16 , already the youngest competitor in @entity18 history , became the youngest ever competitor – from any nation – to win a @entity22 medal when she produced a storming comeback to take bronze in her 100m breaststroke race			1
then @entity27 , already a gold medallist from the 400m individual medley and all but on her knees after swimming in a gruelling 800m freestyle heat earlier in the day , proved all of the ageist doubters wrong to claim a shock bronze in the 200m individual medley			1
already the youngest athlete ever to represent @entity7 , @entity16 became the youngest competitor from any nation to win a @entity22 medal glorious moment : @entity46 smiles as she realised she 's won the bronze medal at the end of the 100m race at the @entity51 one - two - three : @entity46 ( right ) shows off her bronze medal along with winner @entity53 of @entity54 ( centre ) and silver medallist @entity56 of @entity57 ( left ) haul : @entity27 poses with her @entity59 medal in the women 's 200m @entity61 @entity27 , at the grand old age of 24 written off by some as too old and too slow to even hang on to the @entity65 title she ’d won in @entity67 , spent the build - up to her race cheering on 13 - year - old – yes , that ’s right , 13 – @entity72 to a medal			1
then the @entity18 medal machine turned in a powerhouse performance of her own , making a mockery of the theory that swimmers can not possibly peak beyond a certain age			1
‘ at 24 years of age , i ’m still swimming @entity82 , ’ said the diminutive @entity27			1
‘ a lot of people thought i was too old , i would n’t do it , i should be dropped and forgotten about			2
‘ i might be small but i definitely do n’t want to be forgotten about			2
that ’s been a big motivating factor			2
age is just a number			2
it ’s about the heart and determination in the athlete			2
well done : gold medallist @entity53 hugs @entity46 on the podium after the medals are handed out all smiles : @entity46 beams as her medal is presented ‘ for me , i want to prove people wrong – and show a way that you do n’t have to stop by 21 , 22			1
look at some of the world - class swimmers out there showing you can get past the age of 24 and still swim personal bests			1
now i ’m one of them			0
‘ who knows how long i will go on for ? until i stop loving swimming			0
i ’ve got the @entity110 in @entity111 on my horizon and i try taking each block by two years			0
after that i will have to try and organise a bit of a life			0
‘ it ’s just a matter of how much you want it			0
some of us in @entity124 swimming think we get told we are past it and our time at the top is finished			0
‘ to be honest it is up to the athlete themselves to try and change that			0
for me , being told my time at the top is over does n’t mean anything			0
it is only over when i say it			0
’ it was a first medal for the teenager and she made history by becoming the youngest ever medallist at a @entity22 that attitude propelled @entity27 to a fine performance in an event that is far from her favourite , coming back from seventh at the end of the butterfly length to pinch third at the finish			1
she told @entity148 : ‘ to be honest , i thought the @entity65 was my only shot and that was it			0
i am very surprised to get a bronze			1
as you can tell from the grin on my face , i ’m happy with that			0
‘ i ’m almost as happy with that as i was with the gold in the 400			0
and the fourth place in the 200 breast stroke			0
it ’s just been an amazing meet			0
‘ it ’s all about the race and getting stuck in			1
i thought i would maybe get fourth or fifth place so to go better than that and come away with some hardware is pretty special			0
‘ consider that , in @entity67 , i only came away with one medal – and i was super proud of that			1
to come away with two is an added bonus			0
home favourite : @entity27 reacts with delight after discovering she has won the bronze medal in the 200m individual medley ‘ the 800 free earlier , i died ! i was in so much pain ! now i ’ve got to do it all over again tomorrow night ‘ i ’m just taking every race as an opportunity to swim fast , get into finals and get @entity82			1
that was my goal after day one			0
‘ i ’m in the best shape of my life , so i ’m trying to take advantage of that			0
that shows with the times i ’m getting			0
how will i top this ? i ’ve no idea			0
’ if @entity27 was pleased for her own sake , watching @entity46 come back to get a medal of her own proved another highlight , the ‘ veteran ’ saying : ‘ that really inspired me			1
‘ i was just wanting her to get into a medal position and i am so chuffed for her			1
‘ i went into my own race with a big grin on my face knowing she had done that			1
she is such a wee cutie - and it is nice for her to come to her first @entity22 and get a medal			1
’ a stunned and smiling @entity46 , roared on to the podium and cheered every inch of the way as she joined her fellow medallists on a lap of honour , said : ‘ i feel really , really happy			1
i did n’t think there was any chance of the medal , although i knew there was a slight chance			1
i started getting excited during the race			2
power : @entity27 had competed in an 800m freestyle heat earlier in the day but fought off the fatigue to claim bronze in the 200m individual medley ‘ my mum and dad are here and i gave my mum a hug			1
it ’s different being a youngster			0
i am inspired by my team mates			0
‘ i ’ve looked up to @entity27 for a while and it ’s being good being here and being able to talk to all the more experienced athletes			1
‘ i will take my medal to school and show my friends			2
it has been a bit weird but i feel really happy			0
‘ the medal ceremony was really good			2
i did n’t know i was the youngest ever medal winner in the @entity22			1
‘ it was strange when the rest of the team made the guard of honour for me but a great feeling			2

13 - year - old claimed bronze with storming comeback in 100m breaststroke race in @entity256
