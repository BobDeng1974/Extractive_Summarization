@entity0 broke out on her 14th birthday and during the horrific conflict she would lose one of her beloved brothers			1
but despite her tender years queen elizabeth the queen mother was determined to play her own part in the @entity0 at her @entity9 childhood home			2
@entity10 in @entity11 was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers and the then @entity6 would write letters for injured soldiers and run errands from the local shops for them			2
regal : the teenaged @entity6 ( back row , third from right ) with some of the soldiers she cared for during the @entity0			1
one brother was killed during the war and another was a prisoner of war after the death of her brother @entity26 , which severely affected her mother @entity28 , @entity6 took on even more care duties			1
she even saved the castle from being burned down - more than fulfilling her mother 's maxim that ' duty is the rent you pay for life			1
' now pictures of the future @entity6 playing her part in the @entity0 have gone on show at the only home she actually ever owned as part of a new exhibition			1
fittingly the exhibition at the @entity45 in @entity46 show the photographs of the teenage @entity6 at war as part of a display with locals from the county she would later in life call her home			1
caring : after the death of her brother @entity26 , which severely affected her mother @entity28 , the then @entity6 took on even more care duties the tiny island of @entity60 in the @entity61 off @entity45 - where prince @entity62 loves to paint - is remembered with extra poignancy			1
at the turn of the century @entity60 's population was just 375 and 31 men were sent to war			1
six of those men died , including three lodgers in one house who had joined the @entity74			2
by 1961 the population fell to just 12 and the last islanders left at the end of the following year			2
the island is now owned by one of its former inhabitants , who uses it to graze the cattle and sheep which are now its only occupants			2
but it is the images of a young @entity6 that in a way capture the spirit of an age where everybody - no matter who you were , or how old - contributed to the war effort			1
they are also a revealing insight into the care and compassion of the future wife of @entity101 - whose stoicism and compassion would become an enduring symbol of the @entity105			1
the exhibition - which has taken a year to put together - has been curated by @entity107 , whose father the late reverend @entity108 was for 21 years the @entity109 at @entity110 where @entity6 worshipped for almost 50 years			1
' @entity6 knew the pain of the @entity0			2
her elder brother , @entity26 , an officer in the @entity113 , was killed in action at the @entity115 in 1915 , ' she said			1
' another brother , @entity116 , who they called @entity118 , was reported missing in action two years later , ' said mrs @entity107			1
' three weeks later , the family discovered that he had been captured after being wounded and he remained a prisoner of war in @entity122 for the rest of the war			1
the @entity45 is located in @entity46 , on the north coast of @entity9 , about six miles west of @entity126 gratitude : this image is from @entity6 's personal autograph book , which was signed by some of the soldiers			2
' @entity10 was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers , which @entity6 helped to run			0
' though she was too young to serve as a nurse , she did assist her parents in their efforts to support the war			1
i found it very emotional and moving putting the exhibition together			1
' it is is clear that the care and compassion that the @entity6 had was in many ways forged during this period			1
' as well as caring for the troops @entity6 also played a major part in the rescue of the castle 's contents during a serious fire on 16 september 1916			0

exhibition curator @entity107 said : ' it is is clear that the care and compassion that the @entity6 had was in many ways forged during this period ' two soldiers discovered a fire in a room under the castle roof			1
as they ran to raise the alarm , the first person they came across was @entity6 who kept calm and immediately telephoned both the local and @entity169 fire brigades			0
she then marshalled everyone to fight the fire , organising a chain to bring buckets of water from the river			0
later , with the fire raging above them , she organised the removal of the valuables out onto the lawn			0
one of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be ' hung , drawn , & quartered ... @entity183 in diamonds , drawn in a coach and four , and quartered in the best house in the land '			0
the war began during a moment of happiness for the young @entity6			1
as she celebrated her 14th birthday on 4 august 1914 en route to a vaudeville show in @entity194 the streets suddenly filled with people , cheering and waving flags			0
then , at the end of the show , the theatre manager came onto the stage to announce that war had been declared on @entity122 that very evening			1
soon after , @entity6 , her mother and her sister @entity203 , returned to @entity10 where the castle was converted to a convalescent home for wounded soldiers			0
' she immersed herself in their care and welfare			0
this was to be her role throughout the war and her kindness won the admiration of many of the soldiers who passed through @entity10 , ' said mrs @entity107			2
' she even did not want the furniture moved about too much because she wanted the men to feel that they were at home			0
she would run errands , including getting their tobacco from the local shop			0
' but after the death of @entity26 she took on more duties because her mother was so distraught			1
' the mental scars of those who fought and survived must have been terrible			0
i think the whole experience of the @entity0 affected @entity6 greatly			0
four of her brothers served in the army			0
' her compassion and kindness was something that stayed with her all her life			1
she was an incredible and remarkable lady			0
' in 1918 the armistice signalled the end of the war and the end of an era			2
once the last soldier had left @entity10 in 1919 lady @entity6 was launched into the high society of the day at her coming out party			0
a letter to @entity28 from her son @entity26 , who was killed while serving in the @entity113 , telling of his impending wedding and that he intended to ask his brother @entity248 to be best man @entity26 married on 17 september 1914			1
he was killed in action at the @entity115 in 1915 while at a ball in @entity194 , @entity6 caught the eye of @entity253 once again when he saw her dancing with his equerry @entity256			0
@entity6 later refused his first two proposals and after accepting the third , a delighted prince sent a telegraph to his parents that simply said ' @entity262			0
' they married in april 1923			0
the exhibition is being staged in the chauffeur 's cottage at the @entity45			2
having acquired the most northerly castle on the @entity269 mainland , @entity6 renovated and restored it and also created beautiful walled gardens			0
duty : queen elizabeth the queen mother unveils the memorial at @entity275 of sir @entity276 in 1992 @entity6 first saw what was then @entity45 in 1952 , while mourning the death of her husband , @entity101			0
falling for its ruined isolated charm , and hearing it was to be abandoned , she declared : ' never ! it 's part of @entity9 's heritage			0
' with the encouragement of @entity62 , two new ' e ' shaped rose beds have been created in the walled garden - a fitting memorial to his grandmother 's love of roses			0
the castle is closed for the week while @entity62 is in residence - an annual stay he started after his beloved grandmother died aged 101 in 2002 .			2

new exhibition shows how royal cared for those hurt in conflict
she lost her beloved brother @entity26 to the horrors of the war
the compassion she learned there stayed with her throughout her life
