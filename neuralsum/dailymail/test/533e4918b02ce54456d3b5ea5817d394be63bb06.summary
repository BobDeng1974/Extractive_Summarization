speaking in @entity36 yesterday , he said to those who had left the @entity25 fold : ‘ look , we ’ve heard the message loud and clear about the things you want to see changed and we ’ll change those things			0
come with us , come back home to us , rather than risk all of this good work being undone			0
’ the latest polls have put the conservatives and labour virtually neck and neck			0

the prime minister was joined by @entity91 for a speech at the @entity36 and @entity93 this evening but there are deep concerns that support for @entity3 , fuelled by the @entity25 ’ failure to meet their pledge to cut immigration to ‘ tens of thousands ’ , could swing enough votes in other seats to hand @entity103 a victory			1

‘ we can provide that clear , decisive and frankly more accountable government that a majority conservative government would deliver			0
we need those 23 seats			0
’ mr @entity11 immediately attacked the prime minister and said he would not win @entity3 voters back			1
