it 's not the first time the @entity5 figure has washed up on exotic shores			0
the oversized plastic man turned up in @entity25 , in the @entity26 in 2007 , @entity27 in 2008 and @entity28 in @entity29 in 2011			2
there is @entity26 artist who works under the pseudonym of @entity18 , and it is thought that whoever is behind his or her artworks , has also been making the giant figures			0
the @entity5 man has been spotted in areas currently hosting exhibits by the artist , so it 's likely his appearance is part of marketing stunt			0
