by @entity0 from dealing with the menopause to battling empty nest syndrome , life is n't always easy for women beginning their sixth decade			1
looking good : life coach @entity5 has written a guide to handing mid life in style but that could all be about to change thanks to an unusual new self - help tome penned by over- 50 's blogger and life coach , @entity5			1
in @entity15 , @entity5 reveals how women in their 50s can be happier , healthier and sexier than ever before - even if divorce has left them to navigate the murky waters of later - life dating			1
' i ’ve spoken to a number of women about later life dating and their experiences vary incredibly , ' explains @entity5			1
' many are terrified of having sex again , they are worried about their body shape and they fear this level of intimacy			2
' for others it ’s the not knowing what to say or how to be on a date , it ’s been such a long time since they dated			2
' they are worried about online dating as they focus only on the horror stories they ’ve heard from others			1
they worry about being hurt as they may well still feel bruised from the ending of their previous relationship			2
' that , however , does n't mean their worst fears are founded and @entity5 , who is divorced herself , has a wealth of tips to share			1
' i ’d say firstly know why you are dating : are you looking for a long term partner , companionship or perhaps some no strings fun ? ' that way you ’ll know what type of person you ’re looking to date			1
do n’t go on a date with a person who says they want no strings when you are looking for a long term relationship			2
it will end in tears			2
' secondly , make this fun , relax and enjoy it			0
you might make some really good new friends			1
thirdly , have a positive attitude and be open - minded			0
you never know who you might meet			0
' still gorgeous : @entity73 and @entity74 , both 56 , still look as amazing as they ever did 1			0
learn to love yourself , truly accepting who you are			0
rediscover your passion and pursue it			0
nourish your body - feed it well and exercise			0
meditate or find time for solitude 5			0
make gratitude for all that is good in your life a daily habit			1
but it 's not just the challenges of dating later in life that confront today 's over- 50 's			1
there 's the question of maintaining your looks , reappraising long term relationships and most importantly of all , carving out a new role in the family once adult children have left home			1
the solution , says @entity5 , is to approach things positively and see them as an exciting challenge rather than the end of life as you know it			1
' @entity107 can be a very exciting time if you choose to look at it in a different way , ' she explains			0
' you need to ask : " how do i want to live the second half of my life ? " , " what have i been putting off doing that now i can get started on ? " , " what dreams have i put on hold because of my responsibilities to everyone else ? " ' yes , this takes courage but it ’s also important to ask these questions because you really do n't want to get to the end of your life filled with regret			1
' next comes learning to appreciate yourself for who you are - grey hair , wrinkles and bulkier bodies included			0
' we look in the mirror and expect to see the girl we once were , ' explains @entity5			1
' the media is full of youth , vibrancy , skinny bodies and shiny white teeth and if you compare yourself with that , then it 's no wonder you have low self - esteem			0
' the women you should look up to in midlife are those with an inner beauty			0
their self esteem and wisdom comes because of the life they have lived			1
' i have lines on my face , i have a shock of silver hair , my body bears witness to the three children i carried and bore			1
' do i wish i was 21 again ? no ! i have accepted who i am and my self esteem does not depend on what my body looks like			0
' yummy mummies : @entity161 , 56 , and @entity162 , 53 , both remain incredibly beautiful top tips : @entity5 's book : @entity15 : 50 lessons for midlife is out now and there 's certainly no shortage of glamorous over- 50s women seemingly bent on proving that good looks are n't just for 20 and 30 - somethings			1
@entity73 , 56 , becomes more of a bombshell with each passing year , while @entity74 , 56 , @entity162 , 53 , and @entity161 , 56 , all look better than ever			0
nevertheless , for many over- 50s , dealing with midlife is something they need to be supported through and for this , nothing beats enlisting the help of grown - up children			2
' my children have been amazing , ' says @entity5			1
' they have loved and supported and encouraged me on this journey			0
' i think showing your vulnerability to your children is vital			2
i think you become more approachable when you say : " i ca n’t do this alone " or " i need some help "			0
' the children of the midlife woman can really help just by being there for her , listening and understanding what she ’s going through , even if it ’s tough for them too			2
' nevertheless , @entity5 , who says that the main thing holding over- 50s women back is fear , says that with a little belief and courage you can become the person you always wanted to be			1
' if i could offer just once piece of advice to those women hitting their 50s , it would be : " you have more courage than you believe " , ' she says			2
' @entity208 is sometimes simply finding the strength to face another day			0
courage is learning to let go and to start again			0
courage is having faith in yourself			2
smiling , she adds : ' it ’s one of my favourite lessons in the book			0
' @entity218 , £ 7.99 , @entity217 is available now			0
