colour change : the @entity1 last month during her pregnancy , the @entity1 of @entity3 's lovely locks looked their lustrous best			1
but since she gave birth to @entity8 in july , it seems that , like many new mums , @entity10 's hair has looked rather worse for wear			1
so , what is it about pregnancy and giving birth that wreaks such havoc on hair ? why is hair less shiny after having a baby ? often , women find their hair looks thicker and shinier during pregnancy but hormonal changes kick in after having a baby , as dermatologist @entity25 explains			1
' hair has three phases ; growth , resting and shedding , ' she says			2
' normally , hair grows at the same rate that it falls out			0
but under the influence of pregnancy hormones , more hairs remain in the growing phase , particularly during the second and third trimester , which is why women often notice hair becoming thicker as their pregnancy goes on			1
' usually , losing your hair after birth is just your hair going back to normal			1
' will the frizz last for ever ? ' pregnancy is thought to be a terrific time for hair , ' says trichologist @entity50			1
' but that 's not true for everyone			0
hair is likely to become progressively drier during pregnancy as hormones reduce the amount of oil your sebaceous glands produce			1
' as your hormones return to normal , this dry frizz should subside			0
in the meantime , use anti-frizz products which boost levels of oil and moisture , such as @entity69 shampoo and conditioner ( £ 5.99 each , @entity71 )			0
even fine hair can benefit from a light oil			0
try @entity75 's @entity74 ( £ 21.95 , alternahaircare.com ) , which can be sprayed onto dry or damp hair			1
can a special diet help hair recover ? ' just choose healthy foods , ' says @entity50			0
' and make sure that you include protein , which hair needs in order to grow , in every meal			0
' your body considers your hair to be non-essential tissue , so it 's the last to benefit from good nutrition			1
' fertility expert @entity89 's range has supplements for different stages of pregnancy and breastfeeding ( £ 25 a month , zitawest.com ) or try @entity95 supplements ( £ 15.25 for a month 's supply , boots.com )			1
@entity98 iron sachets ( £ 8.25 for 28 , at @entity99 ) are a good way to top up low iron levels , which can result from blood loss during birth and can lead to hair loss			2
@entity106 's @entity105 @entity107 @entity108 how can i give thin hair more oomph ? a clip - in hairpiece or ponytail ( @entity115 's @entity114 , £ 60 , hershesons.com ) gives instant volume , or rub @entity106 's new @entity117 ( £ 6.29 , trevorsorbie.com ) - which contains particles that puff up as they emerge from their container - into your roots			2
there are many volume - boosting shampoos on the market , such as @entity126 , ( £ 9.99 , burtsbees.co.uk ) , but @entity127 gets rave reviews from new mums			0
its thickening shampoo , conditioner and @entity133 ( £ 29.95 at @entity99 or nanogen.co.uk ) contain patented ingredients that copy your body 's natural hair - growth signals , providing extra support for post-pregnancy hair			2
should new mums dye their hair ? it looks as if @entity10 has given up colouring her hair for the time being - possibly because there 's still some controversy over whether women should dye hair while pregnant or breastfeeding			2
@entity151 guidelines say it 's ' very unlikely that a significant amount of the chemicals used in hair dyes will be passed on through your breast milk			2
because very little enters your bloodstream '			0
if you 'd rather wait , try @entity161 ( £ 28.50 at victoriahealth.com ) a brush - on , temporary powder for your roots , which comes in a slick compact in shades from platinum blonde to black			0
additional research : @entity168 .			0
