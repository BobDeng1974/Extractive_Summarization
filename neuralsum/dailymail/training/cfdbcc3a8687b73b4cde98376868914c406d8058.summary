@entity1 warships are to benefit from an unmanned ' eye in the sky ' as part of a new multimillion - pound contract			0
the unarmed @entity7 aircraft is to be used by the @entity8 and will launch from the back of ships to fly above them			1
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) has announced it will use the craft to collect intelligence and scout out the surrounding areas			1
the @entity11 has announced plans to use an unarmed , unmanned aircraft called @entity7 , pictured			2
it can be launched from the back of @entity18 ships and fly above them collecting data and surveying the surrounding areas @entity7 has a built - in electro - optical and infrared camera with communications range over 62 miles			1
the craft can fly for more than 20 hours			1
@entity7 has a 3.1 metre wingspan and is 1.4metres long			0
it weights 44 pounds ( 20 kg ) and can travel at a maximum speed of 80 knots , with an average cruising speed of around 50 to 60 knots			1
the pneumatic launcher is known as the ' @entity32 ' launcher			1
it is recovered using the ' @entity35 ' retrieval system , which uses a hook on the end of the wingtip to catch a rope hanging from a pole			0
it does this by using gps units mounted on the top of the pole and @entity46			0
each @entity7 system comes with four air vehicles , a ground control station , remote video terminal , and the @entity35 launch and recovery system			0
with a wingspan of just over three metres and weighing 22kg , the ' eye in the sky ' will be launched from @entity8 and @entity57 ships by a pneumatic catapult			2
it will then will fly at around 60 knots - although can reach speeds of up to 80 knots - for more than 20 hours			1
it is commanded by a specialist team on board the ship			0
this team plan its missions then control its flights , analysing the information it gathers using state - of - the - art sensors , before bringing it back to the ship			2
built by @entity75 , a subsidiary of @entity76 , the @entity7 is being introduced as part of a Â£ 30 million contract signed by the @entity11 it has been used by other nations but is the first ' maritime - specific unmanned air system capability ' being used in support of naval operations , said the @entity11 @entity7 will add to current intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance methods such as helicopters and long - range radar			1
@entity8 captain @entity88 , said : ' @entity7 represents an important addition to the @entity8 's intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance capability			0
' its ability to deploy during the day and night coupled with the technology it uses , will give commanders a clearer picture of the operational situation whenever it 's required			0
' the @entity7 can be launched from ships using a pneumatic catapult , pictured			2
it will then fly at around 60 knots above the vessel commanded by a specialist team onboard the ship with a wingspan of just over three metres and weighing 22kg , the @entity105 ' will be launched from @entity8 and @entity57 ships			2
it gathers data using built - in sensors and then takes this information back to the ship minister for defence , equipment , support and technology , @entity116 , added : ' @entity7 provides the @entity8 with proven surveillance capability that has already been used on operations by other nations , so we know we are getting top quality equipment			1
' the technology is off - the - shelf and will be available to the @entity8 as soon as possible			0
' our continued investment in intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance systems is essential to keeping our armed forces up to date with the latest capabilities and this will be a central part of the @entity11 's investment in new equipment over the next 10 years			0
