speaking to @entity8 , @entity9 , 56 , said she likes to ' step outside of what people 's idea of me might be ' , adding that the men in her life see her as the person she is , rather than the characters she has played			1
in the interview the actress also discussed staying in shape , admitting that she has ' been on a diet since 1974 ' , and that as she gets older she has to work harder to stay in shape			1
@entity9 gives an open interview to @entity24 , explaining that she is n't really looking for a man , but the qualities she values in men are intelligence , humour and compatibility the blonde star said : ' i take care of myself , which includes dieting , exercising and minimising stress			1
i joke that i 've been on a diet since 1974 , which is basically true			2
' i like to eat , and my body type is not naturally this thin , especially at this age			1
so i do watch what i eat and drink but i 'm not obsessive - it 's just a way of life			1
' so i do n't have dessert after every meal - i just ca n't do it			1
i have a big appetite , and staying on top of that is about knowing myself and saying , " i can eat that today but tomorrow i 'm not going to			0
" ' and i 'm always aware - from gaining and losing weight for parts - that the time in the gym trying to lose extra weight is really hard work ! i always have that in my mind			1
' @entity9 explained that she works out every other day and does cardiovascular exercise three or four times a week : ' i 've had injuries in the past , so i also do " physio yoga " - a combination of physio and yoga , so i 'm constantly trying to rehabilitate my body			1
' the older i get , the less jarring i want my exercise to be , and i find that a long walk is equally as helpful and satisfying as a three - mile jog			1
' she said : ' and i 'm always aware - from gaining and losing weight for parts - that the time in the gym trying to lose extra weight is really hard work ! i always have that in my mind ' speaking about her relationships with men , @entity9 - who has been married three times and gone through two divorces and one annulment - said : and divorced three times , said : ' i do n't know if men are intimidated by me - you 'll have to ask men ! ' if my accomplishments frighten someone , it 's nothing to do with me - that 's to do with them			1
but the men who are in my life see me as a person - as a woman - not as a character i 've played			1
' my male friends do n't seem to have any feelings of intimidation that i 'm a 100 - watt sex bomb standing next to them ; they are able to distinguish between the @entity2 that is their friend , and the characters i have played			1
' she added : ' i 'm not really looking for a man			0
but the qualities i value in a man are intelligence , humour and compatibility - someone who has a temperament that works with mine			1
my professional life has a lot of ups and downs but in my personal life , i 'm pretty easy - going			2
' from left , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity9 in a still from the @entity5 film in 2008 @entity9 also discussed her relationship with her parents , secretary @entity121 and construction engineer @entity122 , who emigrated to @entity123 in @entity124 from @entity125 when @entity9 was three months old			0
she said : ' my mother and my two aunts were a huge influence			0
i come from a family of four children , and three of them , including me , are women			0
' most of my teachers and mentors have been women - it 's what i was exposed to			2
my father travelled a lot when i was young and my mother was always there - so that was where i got my consistency and my values from , more than from my father 's side			2
but i was very close to my father			0
they say that children need their mother , but i think that children need their mother and their father - particularly later in life			2
when i started to go away to school and jobs , that was when i needed my father			0
' my father , who died last year , had dementia			0
you do n't ever get over that			2
when you lose someone you love , you never get over it			0
you celebrate your memories of them			0
you never let it go			0
' @entity9 , left , in @entity167 in 1986 with @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 in the candid interview @entity9 also explained how the roles she wishes to play have changed over the years , admitting ' when i hit my forties i thought , " i canâ € ™ t play a sexy siren any more "			2
' @entity9 on the cover of @entity177 , out now she said : ' almost 20 years later , it 's still going on			1
i think that 's because given a i like to step outside of what people 's idea of me might be			0
' i suppose that makes me a bit of a rule breaker			0
i like to take chances and make choices that sometimes feel like climbing a mountain			0
' such as coming to the @entity189 in 2005 when i was thought of as a tv actress , then going on to work in some terrific theatres with great directors			0
' my generation and the one before me had the freedom to make up our own rules			0
' there has been a huge change over the past 15 years of what a woman in her fifties and sixties can be - we 're much more open to choice			2
' we 're taking much better care of ourselves ; we are all healthier and living longer , and creating lives for ourselves that are more than our mothers had			0
' so there is more opportunity - and women are not beholden to a man or even a job to get fulfilment			2
