by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor grammar pedants have been urged by a minister to rise up against councils who have tried to erase apostrophes from road signs			1
@entity8 said that if humanity can put a man on the moon and split the atom it can build a sat - nav which understands proper punctuation			1
the local government minister insisted there is ‘ no @entity19 rule or @entity21 diktat ’ forcing town halls to wipe punctuation from the map			0
scholars ' walk in @entity27 where somebody has added the missing apostrophes councils in @entity31 and @entity32 have been criticised for removing apostrophes from street names and road signs			1
locals armed with black marker pens have fought back , with with missing punctuation , such as that at @entity40 , having the correct apostrophe inserted overnight			0
on the same sign in the @entity32 ’s @entity27 area , an apostrophe has also been added to @entity45			0
however , mr @entity8 insisted that if the humble apostrophe is ‘ good enough for @entity47 , so should it be for local councils ’			2
local government minister @entity8 insisted there is no diktat from @entity19 against apostrophes in a lengthy response to a parliamentary questions , he said there was no government guidance issued to councils about the use of the apostrophe on street signs			1
he said : ‘ i understand this may stem from a misunderstanding of guidance issued by the @entity63 which is overseen by local government			0
‘ however , @entity65 has confirmed it does n't require councils to remove apostrophes either - councils can continue to use apostrophes and punctuation if they 're used in the official street name			2
‘ one of the spurious reasons for abolishing apostrophes has been the suggestion they may cause confusion for emergency services ' it systems			0
‘ if mankind can put a man on the moon , split the atom and decode the double helix then i 'm sure it 's not beyond the reach of @entity88 technology to have a sat - nav which can understand an apostrophe			2
’ mr @entity8 said he could not support ‘ grammar guerillas ’ who return missing apostrophes to new signs because it is an offence to deface a street sign under 1907 legislation			1
but in a call to arms to grammar fans across the country , he added : ‘ we would encourage residents to defend their traditional place names from over zealous municipal pen pushers			0
’ banned : existing apostrophes such as @entity106 in @entity31 will not be changed but no new signs will be permitted to use such punctuation official guidance : @entity110 said in future all road signs should avoid using punctuation entirely mr @entity8 said apostrophes should stay on road signs , and satnav systems could cope mr @entity8 was responding to a question from @entity118 mp for @entity119 , @entity120			1
mr @entity120 said : ‘ i think i join a long queue of people who get upset when they see misuse of this punctuation mark ! ‘ there is a serious point to be made about how we need to make sure things are spelt correctly - otherwise what is the point in having these rules ? ’			0

some councils have removed punctuation marks from street signs
it is *claimed* satnav systems could be confused by punctuation
@entity8 said if we can split the atom , we can cope with grammar
