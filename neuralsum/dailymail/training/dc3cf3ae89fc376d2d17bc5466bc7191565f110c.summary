by @entity0 there have been many , much applauded steps within the fashion industry to move away from the ultra-thin ideal for women			0
however , most models and store mannequins are still extremely thin , and now an example has come to light of a store popular with young girls using a dummy resembling a seriously underweight woman			2
budget fashion house @entity14 has promised to change a window display after a customer tweeted a picture of an anorexic looking mannequin			1
the mannequin in question was clearly the image of an underweight women , with obviously protruding ribs concerned shopper @entity25 tweeted a picture of the skeletal dummy after spotting it in the shop window of the @entity31 branch			1
wearing a bikini and printed trousers , the shockingly thin mannequin ’s ribs were clearly protruding			1
ms @entity36 tweeted a picture of the dummy to bosses at @entity14 who tweeted back , promising to look into the matter straight away			1
she wrote : ‘ @entity14 , is it really necessary that these new mannequins have protruding ribs ? ‘ and before i get anyone saying i ’m skinny bashing , i ’m not , i ’d just like to see mannequins in all different shapes and sizes in all stores rather than young girls thinking this is the only way to be			1

@entity14 responded to the complaint and now says it will change it 's window display she said : ‘ @entity14 shoppers tend to be young fashion conscious girls and i ’m concerned that it sends a dangerous message to impressionable teenagers			1
‘ if you are going to have mannequins that are thin then they should at least be presented alongside other body shapes so not to enforce the message that very thin is the only desirable or acceptable body shape for women			0
’ other twitter users also slammed the store			0
with users branding the use of the mannequin as ‘ shocking , ‘ disgusting , ’ and ‘ utterly terrifying			0
’ but others were quick to defend @entity14 with one user asking : ‘ what if you are naturally skinny , does that mean you ca n’t be represented ? ’ earlier this year luxury @entity101 linger label @entity99 came under fire after a customer tweeted a picture of a mannequin on display in @entity107 ms @entity36 insisted she was merely calling for more of a ‘ variety ’ of shapes to be represented to send a safer message			1
