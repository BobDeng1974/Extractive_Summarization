by @entity0 last updated at 4:12 pm on 7th december 2011 insulting : @entity1 has angered the @entity3 heroes a minister yesterday likened the campaign for @entity7 convoy medals to @entity8 being ‘ covered in ’ honours			1
@entity1 angered @entity3 veterans by saying @entity11 did not ‘ throw around ’ honours like the @entity14 tyrant and @entity16 dictator @entity13			1
the @entity18 defence minister said the @entity11 only awarded medals for ‘ risk and rigour ’ – prompting accusations he was ‘ belittling ’ the sacrifice made by thousands			1
mr @entity1 made the ‘ sickening ’ remarks as those who risked their lives on what @entity27 described as ‘ the worst journey in the world ’ , took their fight for a medal to @entity33			1
more than 3,000 @entity11 sailors , who faced treacherous seas where temperatures plunged as low as -60c , died to keep the @entity38 supplied and fighting on the @entity39			1
of 1,400 ships on 78 convoys , 85 merchant and 16 @entity44 vessels perished between 1941 and 1945			1
if the convoys of cargo and munitions had failed , @entity45 could have defeated the @entity49 and turned the full might of its military machine against @entity11			1
despite the @entity53 promising to strike an @entity55 medal when they won power , ministers have so far snubbed those who served on the convoys			1
even @entity60 has awarded commemorative medals to survivors			1
only around 200 veterans are still alive			1
hell in the @entity7 : apart from the appalling cold , @entity11 seamen were under constant threat from u-boats , warplanes and battleships unsung : one of 78 convoys that braved frozen seas to help win the war @entity73 , @entity18 mp for @entity74 in @entity75 , used a @entity77 debate at @entity78 to tell mr @entity1 it would be ‘ utterly , utterly disgusting ’ if the heroes went to their graves without being honoured			1
insisting it was an ‘ insult ’ ministers had not kept their promise , she added : ‘ it brings shame on our country			1
‘ at their age they should not have to fight for justice and it appals me that people who gave up so much to ensure the freedoms we take on a daily basis for granted should have to beg for the recognition that they deserve			1
’ but mr @entity1 suggested the campaign was similar to notorious regimes which handed out so many medals it diminished their worth			1
he said : ‘ the intention post-war was not to cover everybody in medals			1
medals in the @entity11 mean something			1
‘ authoritarian regimes and dictators often throw around a lot of medals			1
one can look , for instance , at @entity114 generals who are covered in medal ribbon , or @entity8 , or @entity13			2
‘ we have taken the view in this country , traditionally , that medals will only be awarded for campaigns that show risk and rigour			1
' some regimes give out very large numbers of medals whereas we , traditionally , do not			1
’ mr @entity1 ’s comments infuriated veterans watching the debate			2
commander @entity129 , 91 , the leader of the @entity131 campaign , said : ‘ the man is a disgrace			2
veterans are outraged that their campaign has been likened to former @entity14 leader @entity8 's ostentatious display ‘ it was absolutely disgusting to speak of us in the same breath as @entity8 and @entity13			2
' they made a promise when they were looking for our votes and now they have betrayed us			2
’ miss @entity73 said : ‘ it sickens me that the veterans had to listen to those comments			2
' they have demonstrated levels of heroism the minister could not begin to understand			2
’ late last night mr @entity1 tried to calm the row , saying : ‘ there was no intention to cause any offence			2
' i was making the point that we honour people for their service in a very different way to that of authoritarian regimes			2
’ successive governments have rejected pleas for an @entity7 medal , claiming the sailors had already been recognised with the separate @entity169 medal			2
a @entity171 spokesman said the government would be holding ‘ a fresh review of the rules governing the award of military medals ’			1
harrowing conditions : sailors chipping away the ice and snow from the deck of @entity182 while on convoy duty in february 1943			2
thick snow and ice covered the decks and upper works of all ships betrayal : commander @entity190 , left , called mr @entity1 a ' disgrace ' for his remarks and right , the commemorative medal for @entity11 veterans of the @entity196 hero : in perilous conditions a sailor frees chains , wires and bollards from the ice appalling cold : @entity204 and ice covered the upper works of all ships bravery : @entity209 made 15 convoy journeys between august 1941 and march 1943 by @entity0 battered by waves as high as houses , the ships sailed on through the darkness , fog and appalling cold of the @entity7 winter			1
but the weather was as nothing compared with the fear of being attacked by @entity221 warplanes , battleships and u-boats			0
a total of 78 convoys delivered four million tons of vital cargo and munitions to the @entity38 – allowing the @entity49 to repel the @entity45 invasion			0
the cost in lives was horrific			0
more than 3,000 @entity11 seamen were killed in the treacherous waters of the @entity233 as they undertook the terrifying trips to keep @entity60 supplied and fighting on the @entity39			1
in total , 85 merchant and 16 @entity44 vessels perished between 1941 and 1945			0
but the cost had the @entity7 convoys not succeeded would have been worse : @entity45 would very probably have won the @entity3			0
@entity27 proposed the convoys following @entity242 , @entity45 ’s invasion of @entity60			0
cabinet documents reveal that @entity11 ’s greatest prime minister promised to supply @entity245 ‘ at all costs ’			1
he knew that if @entity60 fell , the full weight of the @entity45 military machine would be targeted at the @entity249			0
over four years , the convoys delivered 7,000 warplanes , 5,000 tanks and other battlefield vehicles , ammunition , fuel , food , medicine and further emergency supplies			0
because @entity261 and the @entity262 had been captured by @entity45 , the only way to get the goods to @entity60 was through the northern ports of @entity264 and @entity265 , both inside the @entity266			0
the first convoys set off from @entity268 and @entity269 in the @entity270			0
two or three reached their destination unscathed			0
but then the @entity221 ‘ got wise ’ to the missions , said @entity209 , 88 , who served as a radar operator on @entity274			0
‘ after they woke up , all hell broke loose			0
they shifted all their most able @entity282 squadrons and u-boats to @entity261 and we ’d be under constant attack from the air and sea , ’ said mr @entity209 , from @entity276 , @entity277			0
‘ you ’d hear a horrible bang and one of the ships would disappear			0
once i was moving across the deck and there was a huge explosion			0
i saw a column of smoke and fire and one of the ships start to sink			0
the poor blighters on board did n’t stand a chance			0
we heard ships call for help but could n’t do anything about it			0
’ mr @entity209 , who made 15 convoy journeys between august 1941 and march 1943 , said conditions on board were ‘ pretty terrible ’			0
he learned the hard way about the freezing temperatures when the skin on his hand was ripped off as he accidentally grabbed a ladder			0
the final convoy departed from the @entity316 on may 12 , 1945 , and arrived at @entity317 , near @entity264 , on may 20			0
it sailed back into @entity319 ten days later			0
victory in @entity321 had been declared on may 8 – not least thanks to the sacrifice of the heroes of the @entity7 convoys .			0
