i worry about the due process for the little black boy dead on the ground			0

' following evidence from @entity7 , forensic pathologists and witnesses , the panel will have to decide whether the officer intentionally violated @entity3 's civil rights by fatally shooting him			1
last month , legal experts told @entity153 the charge is more complex and difficult to prove than a murder or manslaughter charge			0
@entity157 , a professor at the @entity158 in @entity18 , said the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter , as the 12 jury members will have to be certain @entity7 intended to violate @entity3 's civil rights by shooting him dead			1
' the civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction			0
the federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse , ' he said			0
' racism ' : protesters accuse the county police of creating a racial divide in the majority black suburb devastated : @entity177 tributes are paid to shrines for @entity3 who allegedly had his hands up when he died ' there are some criminal charges that do n't involve that kind of mental state , like @entity185 example , anger			0
they can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly , but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right			0
' as a result , he said , they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove @entity7 's account if they are to find him guilty			0
@entity3 's mother @entity198 has urged protesters to refrain from violence , while president @entity201 has called for calm			1
