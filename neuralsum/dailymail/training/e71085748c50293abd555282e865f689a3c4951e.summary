by @entity1 reporter @entity4 pilots who recently landed at the wrong airport in @entity6 have told investigators they were confused by the small airport 's runway lights , believing it to be a larger airport in nearby @entity12 , the @entity2 said friday			1
the pilots of @entity14 from @entity16 's @entity15 said in interviews with investigators that they had programmed the @entity20 flight management system for the @entity9 , @entity2 said			1
but as they were approaching to land at night last sunday , they first saw the airport beacon and bright runway lights of @entity24 , located in @entity25 , @entity6 , and mistakenly identified it as the @entity9 , which is 7 miles away			1
investigation : a crew inspects @entity29 at tiny @entity30 in @entity25 , @entity6 on monday , where pilots accidentally landed while en route to @entity12 sunday evening uncommon around these parts : a small crowd gathers at the @entity30 in @entity25 , @entity6 monday to see @entity4 jet that landed there by mistake			1
the pilots who mistakenly landed the jet there sunday were grounded monday pending an investigation whoops : pictured is the flight path of @entity29 on sunday			1
the flight , carrying 124 passengers and five crew members , was scheduled to go from @entity16 's @entity15 to @entity9 but somehow veered 9 miles off course grounded : this sunday photo provided by passenger @entity49 shows the cockpit and presumably the pilots who 've now been grounded after the bizarre incident the captain had not previously landed in @entity12 , and the first officer had previously landed there once , and that was during the daytime , @entity2 said in an update on the incident			1
they did n't realize until the plane touched down that they were at the wrong airport , the @entity2 said			1
during the landing approach , the pilots contacted the @entity12 control tower			2
they were told by controllers they were 15 miles from their target			0
but the pilots responded that they had the airfield in sight			0
controllers then cleared the plane for a visual approach to land on @entity12 runway 14			0
that means the pilots were relying on what they could see rather than automation to orient the plane			2
instead , the midsized airliner with 124 passengers on board landed on the @entity24 runway , which is half as long as the @entity12 runway			2
the runways are oriented in a similar direction			0
passengers later described the plane coming to an extremely hard stop just short of a ravine at the end of the runway , and the smell of burnt rubber			0
@entity2 said the pilots ' confirmed that they utilized heavy braking to bring the aircraft to a stop			1
' besides the pilots , @entity2 said investigators also interviewed a @entity4 dispatcher , who was on the flight , riding in the jump seat , and listened to the cockpit voice recorder			2
investigators have also begun to analyze the plane 's flight data recorder , which contains about 27 hours of recorded data from the jet 's computer systems			1
welcome to @entity12 ? confused passengers were first told by a crew member they 'd landed at the correct destination			0
a pilot then spoke on the intercom : ' ladies and gentlemen , i 'm sorry to tell you we landed at the wrong airport wrong runway : flight 4013 from @entity16 landed at @entity30 instead of @entity9			1
the @entity120 carried 124 passengers and a crew of five here , passengers line up sunday to board a new flight after being taken to a small @entity6 town by mistake delay : after a five hour delay , passengers were bussed to the correct airport and re-boarded the plane to continue their journey the captain has been with @entity4 since 1999 and has about 16,000 flight hours , including about 6,700 hours as a captain on the 737			1
the first officer has been with @entity4 since 2001 and has about 25,000 flight hours			0
instances of commercial jets landing at the wrong airport are unusual , but not unheard of , according to pilots and aviation safety experts			1
usually the pilots are flying a visual approach in clear weather			0
the instances also typically involve low - traffic airports situated close together with runways aligned to the same or similar compass points			0
we 've arrived : the @entity4 jet landed at an airport nine miles away from where it should have been the incident in @entity6 is the second time in two months that a large jet has landed at the wrong airport			1
in november , a freight - carrying @entity157 that was supposed to deliver parts to @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity161 , landed nine miles north at col. @entity162			2
the company that operated the flight later said in a training video that the crew was skeptical about the plane 's automation after the co-pilot 's flight display had intermittent trouble , and the pilot chose to fly visually when he spotted the brightly lit runway at @entity175			1
last year , a cargo plane bound for @entity177 in @entity178 , @entity179 , landed without incident at the small @entity181 nearby			2
an investigation blamed confusion identifying airports in the area , and base officials introduced an updated landing procedure			0
where they landed : the jet landed at @entity190			0
the runway is half the length of the one at @entity9 so near , yet so far : @entity9 ( pictured ) is where the plane was supposed to have landed the @entity30 started as a dirt runway in the late 1960s			2
the longest of the two asphalt runways there is 3,738 feet			0
. at the commercial @entity9 , the concrete runway is more than 7,000 feet in length			0
in december , @entity4 announced it will cease operations at the @entity9 in june after serving the airport for about 15 months .			0

the @entity2 *releases* new information on last sunday 's wrong airport landing in @entity6
the plane 's pilots say the on - board computer was correctly programmed
however , they visually identified the wrong airport
the pilots did n't realize they were at the wrong airport until the plane had landed
