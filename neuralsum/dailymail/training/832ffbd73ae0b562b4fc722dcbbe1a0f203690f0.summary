parts of a sickening video released by @entity4 militants that shows members of the terror group beheading 21 @entity8 have been faked , experts have claimed			1
the footage , which lasts five minutes , shows the @entity8 dressed in jumpsuits being marched one by one along a lonely beach , each held by a fighter clad in black			0
the captives , their faces uncovered , are made to kneel before being forced to lie down			0
the masked jihadists then behead them simultaneously			0
while experts believe the men were killed by the terrorists , questions have been raised over whether some scenes - including one where the militants appear to be 7ft tall - have been manipulated			1
it is thought sections of the footage might have been shot on a ' green screen ' in a studio - a technique used in @entity47 blockbusters - and that the beach background was added at a later stage			1
@entity50 , of the @entity52 - based @entity51 , told @entity53 that there are several technical mistakes in the video that show it was manipulated			0
she said that in the shot of the terrorists marching their prisoners along the beach , the jihadis appear to be 7ft tall - towering as much as two feet above their victims			2
this observation was supported by @entity47 director @entity65 who described it as the shot with the ' really tall @entity68 and the dwarf @entity69			0
' ms @entity50 added that the terrorist who speaks in the clip - dubbed ' @entity71 ' - appears much bigger than the sea in some shots , while his head looks out of proportion to his body			2
the sickening image of blood in the sea is believed to have been created using special effects ms @entity50 explained that this meant it was likely he had been filmed indoors and the sea scene , believed to be in northern @entity86 , had been placed behind him at a later stage			1
meanwhile , @entity88 said that the scene that apparently shows the sea turning red with the blood of the beheaded men ' was obviously special effects '			1
the experts claimed that only a few @entity96 would have been on the beach along with a ' less talented crew ' than the ones responsible for some of the group 's more high - production videos			2
earlier this week , local media reported that militants from the @entity4 and @entity104 were understood to have rounded up dozens of farm workers in the wake of bombings by @entity108			0
it raises the chilling prospect of yet another mass execution in what is being seen as @entity30 's bid to announce its presence in a new region where it is gaining influence			0
initial reports said seven men had been seized , but that figure had risen to more than 35 by mid-afternoon yesterday , according to @entity121			0
it came as @entity123 blitzed @entity30 training camps , weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of air strikes following the gruesome murder of captured @entity123 workers			1
meanwhile , the @entity123 government called for the @entity133 - led coalition to also target @entity30 in @entity86 .			1

@entity30 released a video last week showing the murder of 21 *coptic* *christians*
the five - minute film showed the men being marched along a beach
the victims are then shown lined up and beheaded in *sequence*
experts believe the @entity123 victims were not murdered at the beach
instead , they were murdered elsewhere with the background added later
the *shocking* scene of the sea turning red is believed to be special effects
the scene where the sea turns red with blood is also thought to be faked
