' twenty - five hundred is a conservative estimate			0
' @entity35 to read a secret government file on @entity39 - @entity38 @entity20 was let go from @entity4 in 2006 along with 16 other prisoners , and quickly returned to @entity21 – becoming its @entity41 , or spiritual leader – and he 's now recruiting for @entity19 ' @entity44 ' : some @entity19 recruits are reportedly traveling with their young sons , who are then educated in madrassa - style military academies ' the intel community as a whole is convinced he 's [ @entity19 leader @entity51 ] @entity53 's link to @entity7 , ' he added			1
' he manages to motivate a lot of @entity6 too , even though he 's persona non grata in the @entity6 , ' he said , referring to the @entity6			2
the official refused to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information , and because he is not authorized to speak to the press			0
a second @entity13 official , lower - ranking but with knowledge of the @entity63 administration 's tactical toolbox and @entity65 intelligence , confirmed the first source 's account			2
' that 's correct , ' he said in a phone interview when asked if @entity71 was sending large numbers of extremists to join @entity19			1
' if we could get him back , we 'd do it in a heartbeat			0
and there are more of them out there like him			0
' he said some @entity4 detainees spend time behind razor wire building networks and strategic connections that become useful once the @entity2 government repatriates them			1
' it could happen during recreation time , even during prayer time , ' the official explained			0
' they 're always plotting , and when someone like [ @entity93 is sent home he leaves with a mental rolodex of people in the movement – everyone his fellow detainees ever worked with or made common cause with			0
' the @entity27 would n't comment on @entity71 's @entity19 recruiting , instead sending a generic statement recounting parts of his history			1
' @entity106 arrived at @entity4 in 2002 and was transferred in 2006 , ' wrote lt. col. @entity107 , a @entity108 spokesman			2

' ' i ca n't comment on behalf of security officials in @entity7 or @entity6 , ' he insisted			1
the @entity6 government includes @entity71 on its list of most wanted terrorists , and the @entity2 is offering a $ 5 million reward for information that leads to his capture			1

' @entity19 can muster up to 31,500 fighters , the @entity142 reported in october			2
if that number is correct , @entity71 is responsible for mobilizing at least one out of every 13 @entity19 fighters			1
but @entity146 , chief of staff to @entity148 president @entity147 , said a month later that the @entity142 and other intelligence agencies dramatically underestimated the total			0
former president @entity24 was under pressure in 2006 to release prisoners from @entity4 , and did so a year after vice president @entity153 warned against it pictured in 2002 , the @entity4 military detention camp in @entity156 became a repository for the worst terrorists captured after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 , but the @entity24 and @entity63 administrations mostly emptied it ' i am talking about hundreds of thousands of fighters because they are able to mobilize @entity165 young men in the territory they have taken , ' @entity146 told @entity167 last month			1

president @entity63 continued that trend , pledging during his 2008 political campaign to close ' @entity4 ' completely			0
his most controversial @entity4 releases were five top @entity184 fighters whom he traded for the safe return of @entity108 sgt. @entity186 in may			2
even then he acknowledged that that decision could come back to haunt the @entity2			0
' is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us ? absolutely , ' he acknowledged three days later during a press conference in @entity195			0
' that 's been true of all the prisoners that were released from @entity4 , ' @entity63 said			0
' there 's a certain recidivism rate that takes place			0
' the @entity63 administration is scrambling to track down @entity20 , whose arabic name is spelled several different ways in @entity205			0
the @entity13 insists that it continues to take precautions before releasing prisoners @entity208 ? @entity2 - led coalition airstrikes have killed more than 1,000 isis fighters , but @entity71 has sent more than twice that number into battle on his own nine years ago , then - vice president @entity153 warned against emptying out @entity4 for the same reason			1
' if you were to release those 520 [ detainees ] that are currently held at @entity4 that have been deemed to be enemy combatants , we 're putting a lot of bad guys back on the street to do exactly what they started to do in the first place , ' he said in 2005 at the @entity225			0
a year later the @entity13 released @entity20 into a @entity6 ' rehabilitation ' program designed to reintegrate jihadis into society			1
he escaped and fled to @entity7 , leaving his wife and three children behind			2

foreign fighters from all over are traveling with sons			0
mostly teenagers , but some are much younger			0
' the office of the director of national intelligence reported ni 2013 that 171 detainees @entity4 prisoners released during the @entity24 years were confirmed or suspected of having re-engaged in hostilities			2

@entity258 , the group 's president , said tuesday that the @entity41 stood as ' a dramatic illustration of the danger of releasing these terrorists			0
' ' the recidivism rate is dangerously high , and to release terrorists in the middle of ongoing wars in @entity268 , the @entity65 , is reckless , ' he said			0
