though it is too early for the @entity10 to predict the weather for december 25 , bookies are forecasting a balmy @entity2 day with the odds of snowfall as high as 10 - 1 in some parts of the country			1
the last white @entity2 was in 2010 when temperatures plunged to -17c and snow blanketed more than 80 per cent of the @entity19 's weather stations			1

@entity24 fell on december 25 in 2010 and 2009 ( pictured ) @entity25 , stormy and windy conditions are expected this year unlike in 2004 when around 60 per cent of the country recorded snowfall ( pictured ) the chance of snowfall in @entity31 has become slimmer , with bookies raising their odds from 6 - 1 last week to 8 - 1 today			1
it is even less likely to snow in @entity36 and @entity37 , where residents face odds of 9 - 1 , and in @entity41 where bookies predict a 10 - 1 chance of blizzards			1
@entity45 ' hopes for a white @entity2 remain in tact however , with @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 more likely to be blanketed with odds of 4 - 1			1
with temperatures as high as @entity52 in some parts of the country , the weather is unseasonably warm for this time of the year when temperatures are expected to stay between @entity56 and @entity57			2
though warnings of high winds and gales covered @entity45 and @entity62 , a @entity10 guide revealed there was little to anticipate in most parts of @entity65			0
meteorologist @entity66 , of the @entity67 , said : ' it 's not going to be a white @entity2 , but it will be wet , windy and stormy			1

' pressure from the jet stream — air currents that act as a barrier between warm and cold weather — will fall south of the @entity19 this weekend , bringing rain and high winds with gusts of up to 80 mph in the north			2
heavy rain is then likely to drift south			0
the chance of snow on christmas day is slim in most parts of @entity65 while @entity45 ' hopes of a white @entity2 remain relatively in tact a @entity10 spokesman said : ' we are moving into unsettled weather , with deepening low pressure and gale force winds			1
most of the country will see winds over the next five days , with the worst over northern parts of the @entity19 and high ground			2
' we can only predict from five days before @entity2 but the indications are that it could be mild			2
it wo n't be anything remarkable , not wildly unseasonable , just milder			0
' less rain and fluctuating temperatures have , it seems , confused not only humans but the natural world			0

temperatures as high as @entity52 have been recorded in some parts of the country this year			2
2001 was another year in which snow fell on christmas day ( pictured ) parts of the @entity19 woke up to an unexpected snow fall in november with temperatures plummeting to -4c @entity120 in @entity121 was blanketed by heavy snow in november but is less likely to see a white @entity2 like the rest of the country there have been 38 snowy @entity2 days in the past 52 years , with 1961 seeing the most snow on ground after 2010 and 2009			1
according to the @entity10 , snow only falls on average five days in december , compared to 7.6 days in january , 6.8 days in february and six days in march			0
@entity129 were more frequent in the 18th and 19th centuries , even more so before the change of calendar in 1752 which effectively brought @entity2 day back by 12 days			0
