you may have experienced the frustration of being slapped with a parking fine or finding your car clamped after leaving it parked precariously for a couple of minutes			2
but now a high - tech car sticker that 's designed to be stuck to a car ’s windscreen , could help motorists avoid such a situation by allowing a traffic warden to get in touch with them			1
the @entity15 sticker sends a text message to a driver when touched by a traffic warden , to allow motorists to send a reply and give them time to move their car promptly			1
@entity38 - based it consultant , @entity37 , came up with the idea and is raising funds on @entity41 to put his € 54 ( £ 43 ) sticker into production			1
the smart sticker will be attached to the inside of a car 's windscreen using suction pads			2
when a traffic warden touches it , the sticker will switch on and will send an automated text message to the car 's owner , telling them to move their car immediately			1
the @entity15 sticker will display a message to a traffic warden on its screen , sent from the car owner , such as ' i am on my way back to the car			1
i will be there in two minutes '			0
it can be recharged via a usb cable and is available to pre-order for € 54 ( £ 43 )			1
the sticker is designed to be used in @entity69 , because of a law that states traffic wardens must choose the fastest and cheapest way to move a car parked in the wrong place			1
but traffic laws vary from country to country , so it may not work in the @entity79 , for example			0
the sticker displays a message from the car 's owner telling a parking warden that they are returning to their car			2
in @entity69 , where traffic wardens have to choose the cheapest and fastest way of moving a car , it could stop drivers parked in precarious places getting fines - but traffic laws vary in different countries @entity95 has asked the @entity96 whether the stickers could be used in the @entity79 to avoid motorists getting fines ( stock image ) car owners can buy the sticker and place it inside their car 's windscreen , having set it up with vital information , such as their phone number			1
the slim design will include a sensor that when touched by a traffic warden , will send a text message warning a driver about an imminent fine			1
the message will ask them to move their car immediately			0
the driver could then type a reply for the warden using their smartphone , which will appear on the sticker 's screen			2
they may choose to write something along the lines of ‘ back in two minutes ' in a bid to avoid a fine			0
the smart sticker system will rely on the good will of traffic wardens and critically , a @entity69 law			1
the law states : ‘ an officer has to choose the most efficient and inexpensive way for the car owner to remove the vehicle			0
’ it could be cheaper for the authorities to contact the driver than to tow his car			0
@entity95 asked the @entity96 whether the sticker could be used in the @entity79 in a similar way			0
a spokesman said : ' in @entity142 there is no legal obligation to warn the motorist before issuing the ticket			0
however , a local authority does have the discretion not to issue a ticket if they believe the situation deserves some leniency or want to issue a warning			0
' if the government wanted to force councils to warn motorists before issuing tickets we would need to change the law			0
' at the time of writing , mr @entity37 has raised just over € 3,000 ( £ 2,362 ) of his € 50,000 ( £ 39,381 ) goal on @entity41			2
if he manages to raise the money , the stickers will be shipped in june 2015			0
it appears that car owners using the smart system could get some unnecessary warning messages , because anyone could touch the smart sticker .			2

@entity15 sticker is designed to be used in @entity69 and is available to pre-order from @entity41 for € 54 ( £ 43 ) . it may not be able to be used in the @entity79
it includes a sensor and connects to a driver 's smartphone
smart sticker sends them a warning to move their car when it is touched by a traffic warden - allowing the owner to send a message back
