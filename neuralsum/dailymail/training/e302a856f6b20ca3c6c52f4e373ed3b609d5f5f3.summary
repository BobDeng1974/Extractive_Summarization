@entity1 's best young talents should be involved at the @entity2 next summer to gain valuable tournament experience , according to the @entity4 's former director of football development sir @entity5			1
there have been increasing calls over recent weeks for at least a selection of @entity1 's senior stars who are still eligible for the under - 21s - the likes of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 - to be included in @entity18 's squad for the finals in the @entity20			1
@entity22 manager @entity21 and his @entity24 counterpart @entity23 sounded sceptical about the idea when asked about it on thursday , but @entity28 boss @entity27 has said he was happy that @entity16 had been included in the under - 21 group for the play - off ties against @entity31			1
@entity13 is an established senior @entity1 player but , at 19 , is still eligible to play for the @entity33 21 side @entity5 told @entity36 's @entity35 programme : ' you need tournament experience - you play a game , there 's another game every four days			1
you pick up a card , or you pick up an injury ... you have to have a squad because 11 players are n't going to get you through			0
' at times during qualifying you have just 10 days , you play two games and then you get another break			0
' tournament football is totally different so that 's why it 's crucial that we qualify and try to play a lot of our best players			2
@entity18 will take his @entity1 side to the @entity33 next summer ' the debate is interesting with the current crop because we 've got probably more ( eligible ) players than ever in the seniors			2
@entity18 and ( senior team manager ) @entity60 ( @entity62 ) will debate with the managers - it will depend on how many matches they play during the season			0
' ( @entity28 defender ) @entity69 has been injured a lot over the last two seasons - he might benefit from a tournament			2
' @entity5 felt how well placed @entity1 's senior side were in their @entity75 qualifying group by next june should also be a factor in how the younger places are utilised , adding : ' is it worth playing them in the ( under 21 ) tournament or just one qualifier ( away to @entity81 ) , because the other game is a friendly ( against the @entity83 ) ? ' @entity16 played for @entity1 at the @entity84 but @entity27 said he could benefit from under 21 football @entity5 , who stepped down from his @entity4 role at the end of august , felt the dialogue between his former employer and the @entity90 was now a lot more likely to end favourably for the @entity1 under - age teams			1
asked if the @entity4 had been reluctant to have a row with the @entity90 in the past , @entity5 added : ' to be fair , we did have the row			0
but it was one that we did n't win at that stage			0
' what i think we have done over the last few years is we have increased the structure fantastically			0
we have recruited a lot of people now where there is a lot of credibility within the @entity4 staff and i think clubs accept that and respect that			0
' sir @entity5 ( left ) said that players will benefit from playing as much tournament football as possible			1

@entity1 will play in @entity115 next summer
sir @entity5 said involvement could benefit some players
@entity13 , @entity16 , @entity69 just some of the eligible players
@entity28 boss @entity27 agreed it could be a good idea
@entity21 and @entity23 were less keen on the idea
