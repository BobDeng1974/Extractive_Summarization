he plays a care home resident who witnesses a violent death in his first leading tv drama role in more than 20 years			1
and for @entity7 it proved to an opportunity to reflect on how he would want to be looked after in old age – and the @entity12 star is adamant he does not want to leave his own home			1
@entity7 , 71 , plays @entity14 , a frail old @entity15 in the upcoming @entity17 supernatural thriller @entity18			1
his character is vulnerable and solitary among well - meaning strangers but it is not an experience @entity7 would wish to repeat			1
@entity7 plays @entity14 , a frail @entity15 in the upcoming @entity17 supernatural thriller @entity18 commenting on the care of the elderly and the ' connection ' with their lives that they lose when placed in a home , the star said : ' my mother never went into a home			1
my mother - in - law , who is over 100 , has not gone into a home			2
' my father was in a home for a bit , and however enlightened the people and friendly the care , i just was aware that he had lost something			1
' and i know that if i was taken away from my home to go and live somewhere else , even if i needed the treatment , a whole part of my life would have gone ; my connection with the past and all the objects that i 've collected			2
keeping people in their own home environment for as long as possible is really important			2
' mr @entity7 said playing a man 10 years older than him made him aware of his mortality , pictured with wife @entity52 playing an old man 10 years older than him has made @entity7 aware of his mortality			1
he told @entity54 : ' i suppose , i looked at @entity14 and thought , ' i 'm not going to be like that '			0
undoubtedly the years go by , i 'm aware that i read the medical pages more carefully , follow the great statins debate and that kind of thing – but to be honest , it seems to me my life is much more enjoyable , certainly better organised , now than it was when i was young			1
i think i have benefited , as i approach my 70s , from the jolts and jars of earlier ages			0
' the admission of @entity7 's character to a care home on the @entity69 triggers a string of chilling events			1
apparitions emerge , linked to his past and , on his first day at the home , he 's the only witness to the mysterious death of a social worker			2
@entity7 admits it was his love of ghost stories that attracted him to the role – that and the opportunity to return to his place of birth			1
' i 'm not interested in the supernatural in the sense that i go to mediums and that sort of stuff			0
nor have i ever seen a ghost or had any kind of psychic experience			0
but i 'm interested just because so many other people have had these kind of experiences			0
i think that in a good supernatural story , the most shocking moments are not always when the ghost goes , ' @entity95 ! ' something just happens to make you think , ' @entity101 , this is terrible '			0
' he told @entity54 : ' i suppose , i looked at @entity14 and thought , ' i 'm not going to be like that ' the three - part drama was filmed around @entity105 and @entity106 and near where @entity7 was born - providing him with a chance to reminisce : ' any excuse , i try to get back to @entity110			1
i find @entity111 , where i 've lived for 50 years or so , exciting , vibrant , stimulating – all those words – but it 's almost as if @entity111 is so vast that you ca n't really get a sense of the city			2
' when you 're in @entity110 you can see the hills around you and there 's a real sense of what @entity110 was – a big industrial city			0
there 's a definite identity still , which goes right through all the people i know from @entity110 , rich or poor			0
they 're proud of @entity110 , in a slightly stroppy sort of way			0
' so when i go to @entity110 , i look around at the stone walls and the hills and i know where i am			0
whereas in @entity111 , i feel kind of rootless			0
' @entity105 , on the other hand , was ' an absolute revelation , ' said @entity7			1
' i 'm embarrassed to say it , as a @entity15 - man , but i had only ever spent about one afternoon in this amazingly beautiful place			1
i keep thinking to myself that i ought to explore a bit more closer to home , because when i do go round the @entity139 , it 's really beautiful			2
and not to know it better is really rather shameful			0
' @entity7 has not played a leading role in a tv drama since starring as a politically conflicted headmaster in @entity145 's @entity144 in 1991 in which @entity146 co-starred			1
since then he has gone on to present several travel documentaries including @entity149 with @entity7 and voice @entity150 in @entity152			1
@entity7 , who is married to @entity52 and has three children , became a household name with the @entity155			2
earlier this year he reunited with @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 to return to the stage for a string of @entity12 shows at @entity111 's @entity162 after 30 years			2
but given his age he is no longer as driven and competitive as he used to be : ' one of the great things about getting older , is that you just do n't feel as competitive any @entity166 my 20s and 30s , i was really competitive , all the time			0
now i think the work i 've done , i 've done			0
judge it one way or the other			0
now it 's time to relax			0
