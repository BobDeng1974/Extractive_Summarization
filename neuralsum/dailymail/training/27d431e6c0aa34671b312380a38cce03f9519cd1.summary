@entity1 's largest hotel , the @entity2 , will be discontinuing room service from august			1
@entity5 's reports that hungry or thirsty guests will instead have to head down to the lobby where a self - service cafeteria called @entity9 opened this month			1
a spokesperson for the 50 - year - old establishment , which charges an average of more than $ 200 a night , said the move reflects the changing ' needs , wants and lifestyle ' of customers			0
growing trend : @entity1 's largest hotel , the @entity2 , will be discontinuing room service from august in 2012 , room service represented just 1.2per cent of total hotel revenue , down from 1.3per cent the previous year , according a survey conducted by @entity23			1
analysts suggest that high prices are to blame for the trend			0
at the @entity2 , located on 6th @entity27 and 54th street , a plate of three scrambled eggs for breakfast is listed at $ 22.50 while a @entity32 costs $ 24.75			1
in small print , the menu also states that for each order there is an additional 15per cent service charge and an in - room dining fee of $ 5.50 per person			1
@entity40 , a travel industry analyst , explained to @entity42 that in cities where 24 - hour dining and take - out services are available , room service has become obsolete			1
convenient but costly : many travelers are put off room service because of high prices ( stock image ) he said that a lobby cafe at the @entity53 would help it to ' win back some of the business it may be losing to outside establishments			2
' some also see the end of the labor - intensive amenity as a way for the 2,000 - room venue to save money and more than 50 members of staff are expected to lose their jobs			1
but mr @entity40 warned that the move could also put the hotel ’s status in danger			0
' there are so many hotels to choose from			0
if everyone is offering room service , i do n’t know why i would pay the same rate with no service ' ' it will be tough for the @entity53 to call itself " full service " without room service , even though it offers many other amenities , ' he said			2
' if room service is a requirement to earn a four star rating from independent organizations like @entity87 , @entity53 's move may put [ that ] rating in jeopardy , unless the hotel can obtain an exemption			2
' for many regulars the news has come as a blow			0
@entity96 , 78 , an author and publisher , told the @entity98 that he likes to have coffee waiting when he steps out of the shower in the morning			0
' i think it ’s dehumanizing the service			0
it ’s what i call catering to the lowest common denominator , ' he complained			0
while @entity107 , 29 , an engineer from @entity108 , said she counted on room service when she arrived late at night and was jet - lagged and would not be returning to the @entity53 if it was no longer on offer			1
' there are so many hotels to choose from			0
if everyone is offering room service , i do n’t know why i would pay the same rate with no service , ' she explained .			2

the 2,000 - room @entity2 has opened a self - service cafeteria instead
