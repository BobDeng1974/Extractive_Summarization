by @entity1 reporter published : 14:35 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 01:59 est , 10 june 2013 it is one of the world 's most sophisticated software programmes , used to tap directly into the servers of @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			2
but it seems the sophistication behind the controversial @entity14 data mining programme codenamed @entity15 does not extend to its logo			1
a photograph of a prism used as the programme 's logo was a free - to - use image taken by @entity23 historian and broadcaster @entity22 , according to reports by @entity26			1
the logo of data - mining programme @entity15 uses a picture taken by @entity23 broadcaster @entity22 @entity22 , right , offers the free - to - use picture , left , called @entity31 on his website the prism on the logo appears to be a close - up of @entity22 ' picture that has then been inverted			1
the bizarre origin of the photograph was uncovered after a company that produced tongue - in - cheek merchandise featuring @entity15 's logo was ordered to stop selling on copyright grounds			1
however , it emerged that @entity22 , who offers some free - to - use scientific pictures on his website , took the image			1
the picture , called @entity31 , shows the prism and refraction of light into a rainbow			1
@entity49 has so far not been able to contact @entity22			1
the @entity51 - educated broadcaster , who is a distant relation of the @entity53 and @entity54 , is well known for his series of history programme , such as the @entity57 's @entity58 and what the @entity59 did for @entity14			1
in 2012 , it emerged @entity22 had been warned about inappropriate touching by @entity63 , then the @entity57 controller in charge of commissioning factual programmes			1
the incident occurred when mr @entity22 embraced a radio producer more than 30 years his junior			2
he said his gesture was misinterpreted			0
the prism scandal hit the headlines last week after documents were leaked to the @entity74 and @entity75			2
the particulars of the @entity15 data - mining programme have been outlined in a top - secret @entity79 presentation for senior intelligence analysts , which ended up being leaked this graph shows when each of the nine tech companies joined @entity15 , with @entity8 being the latest addition in october 2012 it was revealed that the programme allowed the @entity87 and @entity88 to tap directly into the servers of major internet companies			2
it was approved by a judge in a secret court order and allowed the government to seize actual conversations in emails , video chats , instant messages and more			0
director of national intelligence @entity99 said the programme , authorised in the @entity102 , has been in place since 2008 , the last year of the @entity105 administration , and ' has proven vital to keeping the nation and our allies safe			2
' ' it continues to be one of our most important tools for the protection of the nation 's security , ' he said			0
according to information declassified today , the government does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of @entity14 electronic communication service providers			0
it requires approval from a @entity125 judge and is conducted with the knowledge of the provider and service providers supply information when legally required to do so			0
the government can not target anyone under the programme unless there is an ' appropriate , and documented , foreign intelligence purpose ' for the acquisition			2
the @entity87 said the programme is ' one of its most important tools for the protection of the nation 's security ' @entity8 said it had never heard of the prism programme but reports say it contributed to discussions with the government concerning sharing information those purposes include prevention of terrorism , hostile cyber activities or nuclear proliferation			1
the foreign target must be reasonably believed to be outside the @entity14			0
it can not intentionally target any @entity14 citizen or any person known to be in the @entity14 the @entity74 and the @entity75 cited confidential slides and other documents about @entity15 for their reports			0
they named @entity7 , @entity10 , @entity9 , @entity8 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 as companies whose data has been obtained			0
the companies have said they are not voluntarily handing over user data and have strongly denied newspaper reports indicating that @entity15 has opened a door for the @entity87 to tap directly on the companies ' data centres whenever the government pleases			0
amid reports of government spying , mr @entity170 assured @entity14 on friday that ' nobody is listening to your telephone calls '			0
what the government was doing , he said , was digesting phone numbers and the durations of calls , seeking links that might ' identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism ' .			0
