by @entity0 published : 10:18 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 13:08 est , 12 december 2013 a photographer who volunteers at shelters for those sleeping rough has taken a series of portraits showing the true face of homelessness in @entity8 , and they 're not what you might expect			1
in one , an attractive blonde smiles confidently at the camera , her eyes sparkling			0
another shows a man in a sharp suit , grinning cheekily and exuding happiness			0
they are among a number of shots taken by @entity22 , 31 , who wanted to challenge the preconceptions of homelessness			1
@entity25 21 , ( left ) and @entity26 , 57 , ( right ) as pictured by @entity22 for her alternative look at homeless people according to ms @entity22 , who works as an animator by day , she wanted to break the norm of picturing homeless people in such a way as to make them appear hard - up and desperate			1
positive : @entity22 ( above ) wanted to show the homeless people as they wanted to be percieved instead , she has shot simple portraits of the guests which she says shows their characters and not their homelessness			1
she is hoping the pictures will challenge people 's ideas of what homeless men and women in @entity8 look like			2
ms @entity22 says she has met many interesting people at @entity48 , a free homeless centre in north @entity8 where she has worked for four years			1
' i felt there was this huge disconnect between the stereotypes i constantly saw portrayed in the media and the reality of the homeless people i was meeting			2
' people assume all homeless people are drunks or addicts , cast out from society , the reality is very different			2
i have met people from all backgrounds and a rising number of young people who simply ca n't afford rent in @entity8			0
' according to the photographer , some of the residents ' told her stories of being kicked out by corrupt landlords , running away from a violent spouse or being asked to leave the family home illustrate this point			2
instead of encouraging stereotypes ms @entity22 asked her subjects at @entity48 to dress and pose exactly how they would like to be seen			1
she said : ' we see a lot of teary shots of teenagers on the street in the run up to @entity83 but i think people have become desensitised to hard hitting images like this			0
' i feel it is time more positive imagery is used to mobilise people to help			0
' @entity91 , 26 , ( left ) and @entity92 , 36 ( right ) agreed be in the project which aims to a positive side to homelessness @entity96 , 36 , ( left ) is one of the visitors to the shelter from the @entity100 centre in @entity8 , where @entity101 works @entity102 , 40 , ( left ) and @entity103 , 22 , ( right ) were pictured how they wanted to be seen , smiling and confident ' our guests at the shelter are now putting their lives back together and looking forwards , i wanted to portray them as the strong people they are			1
' a wonderful thing to come from the project is that they have been so happy with their images			0
' people become invisible so quickly when they are sleeping rough in @entity8 and a beautiful portrait becomes something very symbolic			0
' @entity118 , 55 , left is one of the oldest people to have taken part in the project which shows how people from all different walks of life have found themselves sleeping rough on @entity8 's streets			0
