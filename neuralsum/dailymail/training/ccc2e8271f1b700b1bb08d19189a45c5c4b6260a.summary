by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 19:50 est , 27 august 2012 a young mother died from a heart condition after doctors repeatedly told her she only had heartburn when she complained of severe chest pains			1
@entity6 , 28 , had suffered crushing agony in her arms , abdomen and chest for months before she collapsed and died at her home			1
but while she had seen various doctors about her symptoms – one just three days before her death – she was consistently misdiagnosed , it was claimed			1
agony : @entity6 died from a heart condition after doctors repeatedly told her she only had heartburn an inquest heard @entity21 could have been saved by a simple @entity23 test			1
this would have shown that she did not have acid reflux , as doctors told her , but a potentially fatal inflammation of the heart caused by a virus			1
last night , her fiance @entity29 condemned doctors for allegedly ignoring her series of complaints			2
he suffered the agony of finding @entity21 lying collapsed in bed at their home in @entity36 , @entity37			2
mr @entity29 also paid an emotional tribute , saying : ‘ @entity6 was loved immensely and will always be in our hearts			1
’ @entity21 , who had a son @entity41 , had first complained of chest pains in october 2010 and was given an @entity23 – electrocardiogram – but the results were normal			1
complaining that she felt huge pressure on her chest , she returned to see doctors in 2011 and then in the months before she died in march , including an appointment three days before her death			1
but rather than repeat the test , which measures the heart ’s electrical activity , gps sent her home , telling her she simply had acid reflux			1
this is when acid from the stomach leaks up into the gullet , causing symptoms including indigestion , heartburn and chest pain			2
the inquest at @entity65 heard that an autopsy showed ‘ chronic inflammation ’ of her heart from diffused viral myocarditis			1
the condition would have been detected by repeating the @entity23			1
paramedic @entity72 , who was the first to treat @entity21 after she collapsed , told the hearing she was ‘ surprised ’ the problem had not been diagnosed			2
after the hearing , mr @entity29 insisted his fiancee should have been offered an ecg			0
‘ she said it felt as if someone was applying huge pressure to her chest			2
she went back and forth to the surgery but was just told it was acid reflux , ’ he said			0
‘ the thursday before she passed away , she went to the surgery again , and again was told it was acid reflux			0
@entity6 with her son @entity41			1
she was found lifeless on the bed at home by her fiancee ‘ if @entity6 had been given an @entity23 , it would have shown up and she could have been treated			1
’ on the night @entity21 died , mr @entity29 had been out with friends			0
he sent a text at midnight asking if it was okay to stay out and she replied that it was			0
but when he returned home , he found her unconscious on the bed			0
dr @entity97 , from @entity98 , told the inquest @entity21 had an ecg in october 2010 , with normal results			0
he said he saw her once after that , in september 2011			0
‘ it is rare and very serious , ’ he said			0
‘ it sends a shiver down my back			0
i am glad i was not the last person to see her			0
’ miss @entity6 ’s last appointment was with dr @entity108 , a gp registrar , who told the inquest the patient had not mentioned chest pains			1
asked if she would have ordered an @entity23 if @entity21 had done so , the doctor said : ‘ definitely			2
we would have ordered an ecg there and then			0
it would have rung alarm bells			0
’ @entity37 coroner @entity116 recorded a verdict of death by natural causes			2
she said : ‘ i can only remember two cases of the condition in 17 years as county coroner			0

@entity6 had chronic inflammation of the heart which would have been *picked* up by an @entity23 test
@entity128 said @entity6 had not mentioned she was suffering chest pains during her appointment three days before her death
