they would begin to suffer when they could not get enough vitamin c - vital for the body as it needs it to make collagen , a type of protein found in many different types of tissue , such as skin , blood vessels , bones and cartilage			1
without vitamin c , collagen ca n't be replaced and the different types of tissue break down			1
