by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:18 am on 23rd august 2011 a newly - discovered deep , cold current flowing off @entity4 's coast may mean the @entity5 is less sensitive to climate change than previously thought			0
the @entity7 feeds the @entity8 - or @entity8 - a giant pattern known as the ' great ocean conveyor belt ' , which regulates @entity12 and @entity13 climates			1
scientists had previously believed that most of the cold water that formed that deep south - flowing stream came from off the @entity18 coast and was made up of fresh glacier - melt water			0
hit movie @entity21 showed how a new ice age overtakes @entity23 and @entity13 in the wake of a catastrophic climatic shift however , the @entity7 appears to contribute more to the deeper part of the @entity8 than the @entity18 current does , according to scientists			1
the ' conveyor belt ' current was introduced in the @entity32 environmental film @entity31 , and carries warm surface water from the tropical @entity5 toward the @entity34			1
in the process , the water warms the air in high latitudes , then cools , sinks and returns towards the equator , flowing as a deep stream at lower ocean depths			2
because fresh water freezes at a higher temperature than salt water , these specialists suggested that this fresh water from glaciers and other warming - related phenomena would get into the @entity5 , where it could freeze and prevent the water from sinking to make up the bottom of the conveyor belt			1
if that happened , and the @entity8 was disrupted or slowed at the place in the far north where the warm water at the surface cools and sinks - called the overturning - it could eventually lead to a colder @entity60			0
study co-author @entity61 , of the @entity62 , said : ' present thinking contends that increased fresh water delivered to the @entity5 , due to melting ice and increased precipitation under a warming climate , will slow down or halt the overturning of the @entity8			0
' this might not be the case if the overturning occurs in the interior of the @entity73 , which feeds the @entity7 , dr @entity61 added			1
' it is not inconceivable that this open - ocean process is less sensitive to fresh water forcing than the presently accepted mechanism ... which might lead one to speculate that the deepest part of the overturning may be less sensitive to climate change , ' he said			0
a @entity81 travels in the waters off north @entity4 , close to where the newly discovered flow of water runs the existence of the @entity7 was suspected for decades but was only confirmed recently by @entity4 researchers using underwater velocity measurements taken from a ship			1
the current can not be seen by satellites or detected by its temperature or salinity , but it does move a bit faster than the surrounding water , @entity61 said			0
@entity61 and researchers from @entity97 and @entity4 do n't know whether the @entity7 flows year round or how it varies with time			2
they are beginning a research voyage this week to deploy oceanographic instruments to directly measure the @entity7 over the course of a full year to try to figure out where and how this current forms			2
the research is published in the journal @entity106 .			0
