the company promised to make the recently unveiled @entity8 - said to run five times faster than the current @entity10 - a standard feature on all smartprice plans when it is added to the network later this year			1
the move is a bold attempt to undercut competitors as @entity17 - the only company which is currently able to offer @entity8 - is currently charging customers at least £ 5 a month extra for the service			1
superfast : three will be offering the 4g network on handsets including the @entity24 , left , and the @entity25 , right mobile wars : three 's decision not to charge extra for @entity8 is likely to spark more competition among @entity31 ’s first 4g network was launched by @entity17 in @entity32 and nine other cities in october last year			1
but currently users must pay extra for the service and also fork out hundreds of pounds for a smartphone that can use the system , such as @entity38 ’s @entity24 or @entity40 ’s @entity39			2
three will offer the service as standard with current price plans for an @entity24 on a monthly contract ranging from £ 34 to £ 44 a month plus up to £ 99 for the handset			1
a @entity25 costs £ 29 to £ 31 a month plus up to £ 29 for the handset on the same type of contract			2
@entity50 , from three @entity51 , said : ' as we add the next wave of technology to our ultrafast network , we ’ve listened to our customers and thought long and hard about the right way to do it			0
we do n’t want to limit @entity59 services to a select few based on a premium price and we ’ve decided our customers will get this service as standard			0
' the @entity8 system allows smartphones , tablets and laptops to surf the web five times faster than the current 3g network			2
cheaper ? price plans for the @entity24 with @entity41 currently range from £ 34 to £ 44 a month on a pay monthly contract @entity17 customers who have upgraded to @entity8 packages pay anything from £ 36 to £ 56 a month based on the amount of data downloads they sign up for			1
many other countries already offer the faster network and most providers charge around 20 per cent more for it			0
three ’s network covers 55 per cent of the @entity51 population with an initial focus on 50 towns and cities , reaching 80 per cent population coverage by the end of march			0
three customers able to benefit from the upgrade include those with the @entity24 , @entity39 , @entity93 , apple ipad mini and @entity38 @entity95 with @entity96			0
device choice is growing rapidly with new ultrafast - ready @entity99 versions of the @entity25 and @entity100 being launched on three within the next month , and the @entity102 launching mid-february .			0
