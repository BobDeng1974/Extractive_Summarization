the 19 - year - old leapt to his death from a bridge after a night out with friends in @entity3 on june 29 last year			1

he displayed obsessive behaviour - cleaning and often throwing things away having recently bought them			0
' the £ 6,000 he got in inheritance , he just blew the lot			0
he had a shopping addiction and this was where a large sum of money was spent			1
' i was shocked [ when i realised he had taken the money ] and i thought it was his compulsive shopping disorder			0
' ms @entity21 , from @entity46 in @entity3 , said she discovered her son had been stealing money since april 2013 , when he was on holiday in @entity49 , @entity50 last june			2
the day after he returned she confronted him , telling the teenager if he did not get help she would go to the police			2
mr @entity1 , who lived with his mother , confessed that he was ' seriously depressed ' and thinking about killing himself , prompting ms @entity56 to call the family gp			1
@entity58 : the 19 - year - old shop assistant had battled depression and obsessions including an addiction to shopping since his father died in 2008 of a blood clot @entity1 ' family today paid tribute to the ' intelligent and much - loved ' teenager			1
they said his shopping addiction was a ' serious problem ' but they had no idea how much he had spent on designer clothes and trainers			1
speaking at the family home yesterday , his mother 's partner @entity76 , 43 , said : ' he was much loved and respected by his family and friends			1
' he was depressed and what he did was totally out of character			0
' he was well liked by everyone who knew him and his colleagues at @entity86 presented a lovely book of condolence about him			2
nearly everyone commented on his great sense of humour			0
' he was just a typical 19 - year - old boy			1
' speaking about his compulsive shopping , mr @entity76 added : ' i do n't know how common it is but it was a compulsion for internet shopping and he did have a real problem			0
it had gone quite far			0
' it was mostly clothes and trainers - he liked to look good			0
' it is not a well documented symptom of depression but it is probably more common than people think because of the ease with which people can just order things from the internet			0
' he said @entity1 was much - missed by his two older half - sisters from his father 's previous marriage and his three nieces and his nephew			1
dr @entity117 concluded he was ' acutely suicidal ' and asked @entity118 to visit him within four hours			0
but the mental health workers were content to speak to the 19 - year - old and his mother on the phone and arrange future meetings			1
he was prescribed antidepressants and referred a number of emergency mental health workers , including nurse @entity127			1
mr @entity127 said the teen 's money worries were a primary contributor to his low mood - along with the problematic relationship with his mum and the death of his father @entity135 from a blood clot in 2008			1
he told the inquest : ' i referred to his response to difficult situations , for example having to repay the significant sum of money			2
' in that situation his initial response had been the only way out of this would be ending my life			0
' i would say it was one of the key concerns			0
' on the night of his death mr @entity1 had been out in @entity3 with friends @entity152 and @entity154			1
the trio parted ways at around 2am on june 29			1
@entity157 caught mr @entity1 stumbling close to a bridge before he jumped half an hour after leaving his friends			2
his mother - who had been working a night shift - was woken at 1pm the next day by friends worried about messages her son had posted on @entity165			1
ms @entity21 told the inquest : ' they were words to the effect of " i do n't want anyone to feel responsible for what i have done " and " i just want to go to sleep for a long time "			0
' ms @entity21 reported her son missing and his body was discovered on july 4			1
coroner dr @entity173 recorded a verdict of death by suicide due to multiple injuries			1
he said : ' i put it to dr @entity180 [ a senior mental health nurse ] there were a number of stresses in his life			1
' she identified particularly her concerns of his use of alcohol and the - i think significant - issue in relation to the loss of money from his mother 's account			2
' i consider that loss of money played a significant impact on him			0
the express concern of how that money was to be repaid			0
' he added : ' i consider that @entity1 did take a deliberate act			2
' i am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that @entity1 knew what he was doing and understood the action he took and moreover knew the consequences of this action would be his death			2
' during the inquest @entity208 questioned the number of different health workers he saw - at least four different people - and a confusion over who his key worker was			2
they also criticised the fact @entity1 was assessed on the phone by the mental health team despite the fact his doctor had requested a visit within four hours			1
they suggested a system should be put in place to check patients have enrolled on the voluntary help programmes			0
but dr @entity173 said the phone call assessment was ' appropriate in this case ' and that @entity1 ' care was ' not compromised as a consequence ' of the confusion over his key worker			0
his half - sister @entity233 said her brother had first been prescribed anti-depressants some months prior to his death , but had stopped taking his medication without seeking medical advice			2
she said : ' @entity1 went on to antidepressants after self - harming and having suicidal thoughts he thought he could cope without them and said they made him feel numb			1
' he only told us this when he reached crisis point , we did not know he had come off his medication at the time			0
' @entity1 was very good at hiding his feelings and wanted to appear as if everything was okay			0
he came off them in april without a doctors advice			0
' he then had a relapse of his depression and this was a major contributing factor to his suicide			0
he started the antidepressants again a week before the suicide , this can heighten your energy for a short period and the risk of suicide can increase before the antidepressants really start working			0
' i think it 's important to raise awareness of these issues in order to help others in @entity1 's position			0
you should n't come off antidepressants abruptly without medical opinion , it can cause a severe relapse			0
' @entity1 had been suffering from depression for a long time and this was the real issue , the spending addiction was just a symptom of this , ' @entity1 was the loveliest , kindest , most gentle and caring person you could ever wish to meet and i wish i had known how to help him			1
