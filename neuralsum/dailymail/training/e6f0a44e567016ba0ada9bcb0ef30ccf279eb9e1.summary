the @entity6 striker , @entity1 ’s 28 - goal top scorer despite missing 19 of the last 32 games , had to watch wednesday ’s win over @entity10 from the sidelines with a groin strain but returns to the squad as the @entity14 braces itself for another nail - biting finale			1
‘ the whole squad is fit , ’ confirmed manager @entity16			1

they lead @entity41 by two points going into the last game this time and must simply avoid defeat against the @entity4 to be crowned champions again			1
@entity16 believes that he and his players will hold their nerve and promised to go for victory rather than settling for the point that will prove sufficient			1
he added : ‘ the experience of the players ( in 2012 ) is always very important but i think it is a different moment , in a different year , with a different manager and a different squad			1
‘ always to have experience is important but the best way to work this game is trying to repeat what we have done all year			2
‘ every team must play every game to win			1
it does n’t matter in which conditions they are playing , every team must want to win			2
when i arrive here , my target was always to play well and try to win the title			1

‘ big teams can not avoid the pressure that you must win important things			2
i talk about our team , @entity38 , @entity91 , @entity93 @entity92 @entity41 , all the big teams			1
‘ there will be the normal nerves we have every week but normally the last games are the most important because they finish what you did the whole year			2
but i always told the players the title would be decided by one point or one goal			2
‘ i think it is very important of the manager to be calm , to try to repeat what we did the whole year			0
preparing the game here is one game more			0
we must prepare the same way			0
@entity1 will break the @entity117 scoring record if they score three goals against @entity4 ‘ i know how to control the nerves			1

’ @entity1 thrashed @entity4 6 - 0 at the @entity14 earlier this season in the @entity128 semi-final , but @entity16 warned that it will count for nothing on sunday			1
‘ i think that all the games are different , ’ he added			0
