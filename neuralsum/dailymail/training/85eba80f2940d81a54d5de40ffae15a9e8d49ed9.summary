@entity0 is to undergo a medical at @entity2 as he closes in on a return to @entity5 football			1
the 32 - year - old @entity7 striker will have medical checks within the next 24 hours with a view to completing his switch to the @entity2			2
@entity2 have been engaged in advanced talks with @entity0 recently and now look to be closing in on a capture they hope will significantly boost their attacking threat			2
@entity0 will undergo a medical at @entity2 as he closes in on a move to the @entity2 the @entity2 have turned to the former @entity18 front man after scoring just 18 goals in their opening 21 @entity22 fixtures of the season , with @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 having contributed only six of them			1
it is understood chairman @entity30 and sporting director @entity31 have put together a lucrative package to lure @entity0 not only back to his native country , but also to the north east after it became clear he was looking for a way out of @entity36 after less than a year in @entity37			0
sources on @entity39 were cautiously optimistic that a deal could be done on wednesday morning , and that optimism grew when news of the medical emerged			0
however , the transfer could yet depend on @entity37 international altidore , whose future has been the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks , and his proposed move in the opposite direction			0
@entity0 ( left ) joined @entity36 side @entity7 during the summer but is keen on return to @entity53 that switch would have to be ratified by @entity36 , which operates an allocation process , and meet with @entity26 ’s approval to allow the @entity0 transfer to go through			1
@entity0 only joined @entity7 during the summer , but , despite having scored 11 goals in 16 league appearances after signing a four - year deal , he has not settled and has been courted by a series of @entity22 clubs			1
he has been training with @entity18 , @entity2 ’s next league opponents on saturday , in recent days			0
the @entity64 , who worked briefly with @entity2 boss @entity65 during his time at @entity18 , has scored goals throughout his club career and has 19 in 55 appearances for @entity53 to his name			2
that is something @entity26 has singularly failed to do since arriving on @entity39 from @entity74 club @entity73 in a £ 6.5million in july 2013			0
the 25 - year - old , who also signed a four - year deal , has scored just three times for the club in 52 outings			0
@entity0 ( right ) has scored 11 goals in 16 league appearances for @entity7 since joining the club			1

@entity2 have scored just 18 goals in 21 @entity22 matches
@entity0 has scored 11 goals in 16 league matches for @entity7
@entity26 could move to @entity7 as part of the proposed deal
