by @entity0 published : 09:48 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 10:17 est , 21 december 2012 a hospital trust has apologised to the parents of a baby who died after medics failed to spot he was being starved of oxygen during labour			1
an inquest into the death of baby @entity9 recorded a narrative verdict after concluding at @entity11			2
deputy coroner for @entity13 and @entity14 heard that before @entity9 was delivered , maternity staff at @entity16 failed to correctly interpret data monitoring his heart rate and a trace , showing @entity9 was in distress , was missed			1
errors : the coroner heard that before @entity9 was delivered , maternity staff at @entity16 ( pictured ) failed to correctly interpret data monitoring his heart rate and a trace , showing @entity9 was in distress , was missed she was also told that foetal blood samples which could also have identified @entity9 was in distress were not taken			1
health bosses at @entity16 have already carried out their own internal investigation , identifying failings in the level of care it provided to the @entity35 family			1
mrs @entity14 , giving her verdict , said : ' @entity9 died from hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy ( @entity38 ) caused by asphyxia during labour which went undiagnosed and untreated before birth as a result of a failure to correctly interpret the @entity44 ( cardiotocography ) and undertake a foetal blood sample in accordance with the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) guidelines			1
@entity9 was born on may 29 but had been starved of oxygen for so long that he sustained irreversible brain damage			1
he was born white and floppy , according to his parents @entity51 and @entity35			1
@entity53 ( @entity38 ) is a condition that usually occurs when newborn 's brain is starved of oxygen due to asphyxia			1
within as little as five minutes of oxygen deprivation , cerebral cells can begin to die which can seriously affect brain function			2
the disease can also cause long - term damage , including intellectual disability , delayed development , seizures , and cerebral palsy			2
while it is most commonly associated with newborn babies , it can , in some circumstances , affect adults as well			0
causes can include complications at birth , carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning , drowning , drug overdose , smoke inhalation , high altitudes and heart attacks			2
@entity9 , who was the couple 's first and to date only child , was later transferred to @entity83 but despite treatment , including a medical procedure to cool his brain , nothing could be done to save him			1
mr and mrs @entity88 requested a christening be held at the hospital , following which he was taken off life support , dying in his parents ' arms at 9.30pm on may 31 , just two days after birth			1
in a further blow for the family , mrs @entity88 , 40 , has since been diagnosed with breast cancer and is now undergoing chemotherapy			0
following the inquest , the family 's lawyer @entity99 of @entity101 urged the trust to do all it could to share the results of ' the series of failings ' it identified in moments leading up to @entity9 's delivery			2
he said : ' while nothing can turn back the clock for @entity51 and @entity35 , the fact the trust has now admitted liability is of some comfort and hopefully the civil claim can now be quickly resolved			1
' mrs @entity88 , a technical liaison director with a marketing agency , said : ' the hospital had already identified that because of my age , my pregnancy was ' high risk ' and as such i should have been carefully monitored during every stage of my labour			0
' i was in so much pain because of the drugs they were using to induce the birth , but i was told that everything was fine and as a first - time mother i put my trust and the life of my unborn son in the doctors ' hands			0
' even when they realised that @entity9 was , in fact , in distress , there seemed to be endless delays taking me into theatre for surgery , where he was finally delivered			1
' @entity35 kept dashing back and forth between me and the doctors who were desperately working on @entity9 trying to get lines into him and resuscitate him			1
' when he was transferred to @entity83 to undergo cooling therapy in an attempt to limit the brain injury he had suffered , i was still recovering from surgery and was n't able to travel with him			0
' i had only seen @entity9 for 10 minutes after he had been born and at that point i was n't aware just how poorly he was			0
' when @entity35 and i saw him in the neonatal intensive care unit , we realised the enormity of the situation			0
the doctors admitted he was so poorly that the only thing keeping him alive was the life - support equipment			0
' we knew we had to say goodbye to him and we quickly arranged a christening service at the hospital and invited close members of our family who came to support us			0
' taking the final decision to turn off his life support is the most difficult thing i have ever had to do but we knew we did n't have any option and @entity9 passed away peacefully in our arms			2
' mrs @entity88 added : ' the battle to cope with @entity9 's tragic and untimely death has been made even worse by the news that i have advanced breast cancer			0
' despite this , we are determined to remain focused on our battle for justice to ensure the hospital has indeed learnt lessons from what happened to @entity9 so that no other couple has to suffer the heartache we have endured			0
' @entity177 , the hospital trust 's chief executive , said : ' the trust has accepted there was a delay in the delivery of @entity9 , which we sincerely regret			0
' we have fully investigated events leading up to the delivery and have taken action in a number of areas to make improvements			0
' on behalf of the trust , i would like to apologise and offer my condolences to @entity9 's family			0
