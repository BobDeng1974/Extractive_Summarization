major industries will quit @entity2 if fracking is not made an urgent priority , peers claim			1
shale gas drilling has been held up by complex rules and exaggerated environmental fears , a report by the @entity6 says			0
its chairman @entity10 said : ‘ potentially it ’s a remarkable opportunity for this country			1
we believe the government needs to get its act together			0
’ a 100 - page report has been highly critical of the @entity19 s failure to get fracking under way , despite the claim by prime minister @entity23 , pictured , to be ' all out for shale ' industries using large amounts of energy – steel , petrochemical and heavy manufacturing – could leave @entity2 in the search for cheaper supplies , putting 250,000 jobs at risk , the report said			1
peers also backed moves by the government to change trespass laws so that shale companies could drill under people ’s property without their permission			0

lord @entity10 , said : ‘ here in the @entity2 we have not yet left the starting gate			2
‘ developing a successful shale gas and oil industry in the @entity2 must be an urgent national priority			1

there are fears that major industries will quit @entity2 if fracking is not made a priority they also backed moves by the government to change trespass laws so that shale companies could drill under people ’s property without their permission to ensure development could go ahead ‘ without undue delay or cost ’			1
and they said the successful development of shale gas and oil in the @entity2 could reduce the country ’s reliance on energy imports from places such as @entity92 and improve energy security			2
the industry could also ‘ dampen ’ expected gas price rises , they concluded			0
their report says : ‘ substantial shale gas production in the @entity2 could help retain and develop energy intensive industries and provide feedstock to petrochemical plants			2
‘ if however there is no prospect that the @entity2 ’s shale gas resource will be developed within a reasonable timescale , energy intensive industry is likely to move elsewhere			2
’ exploring for shale gas has been held up by a ' dauntingly complex ' regulatory system and ' much exaggerated ' environmental fears , sparking protests like the ones seen here in @entity114 , @entity115 the report cited @entity117 , executive director of energy firm @entity118 , who had told the committee : ‘ energy intensive users employ almost a quarter of a million people in this country , and i believe that without this sort of development we will no longer be able to do that in 10 or 15 years ’ time			0
’ @entity129 @entity2 chief scientist dr @entity128 criticised the report , warning fracking was a ‘ non-solution ’ that would not deliver for many years , if at all			1
@entity134 , chief executive of the @entity135 , which represents fracking firms , said : ‘ the onshore oil and gas industry is ready and willing to step up to the challenge set by the @entity6 of developing a shale gas industry that can be of great benefit to the @entity2 economy			1
’ @entity143 , the energy minister , said the report would be considered ' carefully '			0
' this report sets out that shale gas development has huge potential to provide the @entity2 with greater energy security , investment and jobs , ' he said			1
' this government has made great progress creating a tax regime and simplifying regulation in a way that fosters the @entity2 ’s emerging shale gas industry and protects the public			2

major firms could leave @entity2 if fracking is not made priority , peers warn
up to 250,000 jobs could be lost if urgent action not taken , committee says
fracking represents ' remarkable opportunity ' for @entity2 , report claims
