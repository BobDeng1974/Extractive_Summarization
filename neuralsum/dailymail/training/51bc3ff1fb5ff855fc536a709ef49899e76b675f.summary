by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 11:30 est , 20 september 2013 three @entity2 sailors underwent a dramatic rescue when they were shipwrecked off @entity4 during a violent storm			1
the three men , all in their 60s , were stranded aboard the yacht ' @entity9 ' for 14 hours as @entity4 emergency services battled the elements to reach them , stranded below a cliff face near the fishing village of @entity14			1
as the raging sea battered them onto the rocks , the @entity4 coastguard were beaten back by the waves			1
the coastguard summoned the jandarma ( army police ) for help but the gale force winds and high seas meant they , too , were unable to reach the terrified sailors			1
washed up : the yacht was stranded below a cliff face near the fishing village of @entity14 danger : @entity4 coastguard officials feared that the yacht would sink regarding land rescue 8th/9th september 2013 dear members of @entity34 , on the above night i was fortunate enough to be rescued by members of your team			1
my friends and i were shipwrecked on some rocks opposite @entity40 and your organization were informed of our plight			2
you can imagine our relief when we were told of your impending arrival			2
obviously we had to wait a while because , as we found out later your team had to come from @entity48 and trek across two mountains to find us			2
the relief we felt when eight torch lights appeared over the top of the rise was enormous			2
once the team members were with us , their professionalism was unbelievable			2
they immediately took control and enquired of our condition			0
hot drinks and food were supplied and our condition was assessed and verified to be ok			0
all our wet clothes were removed and new ones were supplied and a fire was built to dry us and them out			0
we thought , once this was done , they were going to leave whilst we waited for the coastguard to arrive			1
to their credit they stayed with us all night - keeping our spirits up and looking after us			0
' if it had not been for them i am sure hypothermia would have set in and the end result would have been disastrous ! ! my heartfelt thanks are sent to all your team members and your organization as without you i am sure i would not be writing this letter			0
fearing the listing yacht would sink at any moment @entity85 , the @entity4 volunteer mountain rescue team trekked over two mountains and scaled down the cliff face to reach the desperate @entity88			1
securing the yacht to the rocks and helping the exhausted sailors onto a tiny isolated beach , @entity85 , built a campfire and dished out warm clothes and tea , comforting the cold and shocked crew until sunrise when the storm finally passed			0
and now the grateful storm survivors have told how they owe their lives to the incredible efforts of the @entity4 rescue teams			1
the three silver - haired sailors , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity82 , were cruising around the @entity106 and had set sail in the @entity108 from the @entity109 heading to @entity40 when they were caught in the storm late in the afternoon of sunday september 8			0
blown miles off course they ran aground on needle sharp rocks at the point where the @entity114 meets the @entity108 and the two strong currents merge			0
stuck fast , severely listing and taking on water the men radioed for help but after the coastguard and jandarma were defeated by the storm they summoned @entity85 - a volunteer mountain rescue service famed throughout @entity4 for their incredible derring - do			1
@entity85 set out from @entity48 - nearly 50 miles away - but reaching @entity14 they still had to cross two mountain peaks on foot before scaling down the cliff face with all their rescue equipment			1
waiting aboard the sinking yacht mr @entity82 explained , in a letter ( right ) , the joy and relief he and his friends felt on seeing the @entity134 torches appear through the darkness			0
at first light , after the storm passed , the coastguard arrived at the inaccessible cove and took the three battered brits on an inflatable dinghy to shore			2
they were examined at @entity142 but had suffered no lasting damage and have since returned to the @entity2 none the worse for their ordeal			0
for @entity85 the incredible rescue is all part of a day 's work			0
the crack rescue team was first established in 1996 as an association of unpaid volunteer members in @entity153 under the leadership of the renowned @entity4 mountaineer @entity155			1
the organization delivers emergency and disaster relief to people trapped in caves , lost on mountains or to victims of earthquake or flood disasters both at home and abroad .			0

the men , all in their 60s , were stranded for 14 hours before being rescued
fierce seas *initially* prevented the @entity4 coastguard reaching them
