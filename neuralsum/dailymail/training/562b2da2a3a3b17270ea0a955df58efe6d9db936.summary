in the @entity37 , which first reported the story last week , the former priest , who remains anonymous , today said he had been ' disappointed ' by the church 's reaction			1
he said : ' there have been two sensations for me this week			0
one is feeling the hot breath of the media on the back of my neck and the other is sensing the cold disapproval of the church hierarchy for daring to break ranks			2
' i feel like if they could crush me , they would			0
' the vacuum the church has created has allowed whimsy and speculation to distort the truth , and the only support i have been offered is a cursory email with a couple of telephone numbers of counsellors hundreds of miles away from me			2
' @entity0 is now archbishop @entity65 and @entity3 and has no role in the governance of the diocese			1
he has not travelled to @entity69 for the conclave to elect the next pope meaning the church in @entity18 has no vote in the process			1
he said : ' the timing is very unfortunate and it does appear as if one has followed the other , which in terms of chronology one has followed the other , but that 's not the same as saying one caused the other			2
' when it comes to responding to the allegations i think what he will do is act on his legal advice , and the legal advice at the moment would be to not publicly engage with the detail as it stands of the allegations			0
' another priest has called for the @entity105 in @entity106 to be more open in dealing with complaints			2
father @entity108 said : ' if the @entity105 in @entity106 is to heal itself , we need transparency and understanding			0
' we need to learn lessons from the mistakes we have made in the past and move on to become a more loving and understanding church which does not condemn victims or even abusers			2
' cardinal @entity118 said sorry as it was revealed that he must resign now rather than wait until his 75th birthday , which falls this month			0
in a statement the @entity15 said : ‘ looking back over my years of ministry : for any good i have been able to do , i thank @entity123			0
for any failures , i apologise to all whom i have offended			0
’ cardinal @entity118 ’s apology follows growing controversy over his leadership in recent weeks			0
the vehemence of his public stand against same - sex marriage led to condemnation by the gay lobby			0

position : the archbishop was the head of the @entity105 in @entity106 and the @entity18 's senior priest senior church figures are expected to go at 75 , but the @entity9 often allows leeway of a year or two			1
following news of the sex scandal over the weekend , the @entity27 gave @entity148 no choice			1
