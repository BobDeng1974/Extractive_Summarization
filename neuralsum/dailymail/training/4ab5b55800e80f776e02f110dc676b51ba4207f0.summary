by @entity0 @entity2 striker @entity1 left the @entity3 on a positive note by leading @entity5 to their first victory in the tournament			1
@entity1 was heavily criticised at home after a series of missed chances in @entity5 's second game against @entity13 saw them eliminated			2
but the 28 - year - old fared rather better on wednesday when his opening strike helped ensure his proud nation would n't finish bottom of @entity19 and without a point in their debut @entity3			0
deadlock broken : @entity1 is muted in his celebration after opening the scoring for @entity5 precision : the @entity2 striker put his nation in the lead with a sublime left - footed strike out of reach : @entity33 goalkeeper @entity32 is given no chance as @entity1 's shot goes in off the post finally : @entity1 scored with his 12th shot of the tournament after @entity5 's losses to @entity40 and @entity13 @entity41 end @entity33 's @entity3 dreams @entity5 : @entity43 6 , @entity44 7 , @entity45 6 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 6 ( @entity49 61 ' , 6 ) , @entity50 7 , @entity51 7 , @entity52 7 ( @entity53 78 ' ) , @entity1 8 , @entity54 6 subs not used : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65			1
goals : @entity1 23 ' , @entity50 ' , @entity44 83 ' booked : @entity51 @entity33 : @entity32 6 , @entity67 5 , @entity68 5 , @entity69 6 , @entity70 6 , @entity71 6 , @entity72 6 , @entity73 6 ( @entity74 68 ' , 5 ) , @entity75 7 ( @entity76 45 ' , 6 ) , @entity77 5 ( @entity78 5 ) , @entity79 6 subs not used : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 goal : @entity79 82 ' booked : @entity91 referee : @entity93 ( @entity94 ) 7 @entity96 's @entity95 effectively sealed the points with a second goal after an hour that also ended @entity33 's slim hopes of getting through to the last 16			1
@entity102 's @entity101 gave @entity33 some hope late on by scoring their first goal of the @entity3 but @entity5 immediately extended their two - goal advantage with a fine effort by @entity107			1
after a frustrating opening , @entity1 found himself free of white - shirted defenders for once as he picked up the ball midway in the @entity112 half and buried a low left - foot finish from 22 yards			2
the nature of his subdued reaction to scoring underlined what a difficult campaign he 's just been through , including a goal wrongfully disallowed against @entity13			0
@entity33 needed to win to retain any hope of reaching the knockout stages as group runners - up to @entity40 - but you would n't have known it as they began with a rigid 4 - 1 - 4 - 1			2
their manager @entity124 , formerly sir @entity127 's no 2 at @entity128 , masterminded one of the best - organised defences in the tournament , but they were also lightweight up front and the last team in @entity134 to score			0
clash : @entity5 team - mates @entity51 ( front ) and @entity45 ( centre ) writhe on the ground after colliding with each other winded : @entity1 lifts @entity45 after the @entity5 pair came together in the centre of the pitch back to his feet : despite looking worse for wear , both players were back in action within moments slotted : @entity96 midfielder @entity95 takes his chance to put @entity5 2 - 0 up against @entity33 cool and calm : @entity50 shoots as @entity5 go 2 - 0 up at @entity150 in @entity151 despair : @entity33 's @entity71 covers his face as @entity33 's chances of advancing evaporate often , @entity156 - who missed a chance to give @entity33 a famous result against @entity160 's @entity40 - was left on his own up front and his goal record of one in 17 games for @entity102 last season did n't inspire confidence either			1
@entity151 had become known at this @entity3 as the " @entity167 " - with the three previous games staged there yielding 17			0
after @entity1 had scored , @entity33 were unlucky when a shot by @entity75 beat @entity43 and crashed off the underneath of the crossbar			0
goal - line technology was called for and showed the ball clearly had n't crossed the line			0
with @entity13 losing to @entity40 , @entity33 knew they could qualify if they overturned @entity5 's advantage			1
back in it : @entity33 were given a glimmer of hope for @entity156 finished on the far post broken down : the @entity102 striker scored @entity33 's first goal of the tournament past @entity186 's @entity185 get on with it : @entity72 grabs the ball quickly for the restart as @entity33 chased a victory back of the net : @entity101 's celebration is muted as @entity33 still need to score two goals to progress but that became an impossible task when @entity67 needlessly gave the ball away and @entity1 reacted quickly to play in @entity50 , who was level with last defender and scored with ease			1
@entity101 finished smartly from six yards to briefly reduce the scoreline to 2 - 1 but within 120 seconds , the overlapping @entity200 fired in his first international goal to atone for an earlier miss from @entity1 's pass			1
for a country of just four million people , @entity5 can go home feeling prouder of their performances in @entity134 than @entity210 for example			0
their real achievement was qualifying for the finals after a tragic recent history that saw 200,000 people killed during a brutal war in the 1990s following independence			0
maiden : @entity107 ( right ) blasts his shot into the inside of the far post after a fast break out on a high : @entity44 lifted up as his goal clinches a morale - boosting win for @entity5 as they bow out in @entity134 maiden : @entity228 - based @entity44 celebrates his first goal for @entity5 after a busting run from the back if @entity1 had been luckier and more clinical against @entity13 , it probably would have been them progressing to the knockout stages rather than the @entity235			1
@entity33 will lament a lack of firewpower up front			0
with a @entity3 record of one win in 12 - against the @entity240 in 1998 - they lack belief to go with their technical ability , and @entity245 will now step down and seek a new challenge after being in charge for three years			0
but anyone who saw their effort against @entity40 which they only lost 1 - 0 to a brilliant @entity160 goal will know their trip to @entity255 has been worthwhile .			2

a win for @entity33 would have put them in the last - 16 ahead of @entity13
instead @entity261 's side finished last in @entity262 , behind @entity5
@entity5 finish third in the group behind @entity40 and @entity13
@entity2 striker @entity1 opened the scoring in the 23rd minute
@entity96 midfielder @entity95 made it 2 - 0 in the second half
@entity33 *pegged* back a goal through @entity102 's @entity79
@entity5 defender @entity107 hit back on the counter within a minute
@entity40 beat @entity13 3 - 2 , with two goals to @entity160 , to top @entity262
