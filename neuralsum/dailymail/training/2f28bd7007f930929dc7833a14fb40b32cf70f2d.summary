posing under the fake name , @entity0 bought a house in @entity50 , @entity51 , and took on a tenant by the name of @entity54			2

to claim the incapacity benefit , which has since been phased out by the government , @entity0 had to obtain an @entity62 card for ' @entity54 ' and complain he was unfit to work due to depression			1
the court heard how ' @entity54 ' - whose real - life double had in fact left @entity67 to live in @entity28 - was prescribed @entity68 , declared unfit to work and even referred to a counsellor			2
@entity0 's third identity was @entity71 , a friend who had drowned in @entity72 in 1996			1
he bought a house in @entity29 , @entity51 , under mr @entity71 ' name and then pretended he was a tenant to claim a string of benefits			2
@entity0 's claims had a deep effect on his dead friend 's sister - who was offered a ' glimmer of hope ' that he had not drowned after all , the court heard			1
@entity0 's fourth identity was @entity86 , who was still alive but had moved to @entity87 following a family fight			0

he had a bank account with @entity109 and @entity110 and - as with ' @entity54 ' - was signed off as unfit to work after telling doctors he had depression and suicidal thoughts			0
@entity0 was only discovered after the real @entity54 returned home from @entity28 and found letters demanding money and claiming he had been receiving benefits			2
he contacted the authorities and police traced @entity0 to the home where ' @entity86 ' was living in @entity120 , @entity93			1
justice : @entity0 was jailed for three years today at @entity29			1

you are a greedy man @entity0 ' records showed @entity0 - using his real name - had bought the house in cash for £ 70,000 and ' @entity86 ' was supposedly living there as a tenant			1
but they found the 16 diaries which exposed the scale of the scam , linking him with the other properties in @entity50 and @entity140			2
they also showed he had links to @entity143 and @entity144 in @entity51 and @entity94 , @entity95			0
@entity0 pleaded guilty to 20 separate counts of fraud and making false representations			0
judge @entity122 told @entity0 he had seen the benefits system as ' a portal to riches '			2
' benefits and the benefits system are to help those in need , those unable to finance their lives without the support and assistance of the state , ' he said			0
' they are not there , in your own counsel 's words , for those who are seduced by greed			0
you are a greedy man @entity0			0
' your case has a deeply unpleasant and deeply hurtful aspect of you stealing the identities of men who have lost their lives			0
' @entity171 , defending , said @entity0 has an 18 year old daughter and told police he ' was seduced by greed '			0
' he was encouraged by the ease with which these offences could be committed , ' mr @entity171 said			0
' they did n't require special tools or special knowledge '			0
speaking after @entity0 was sentenced , @entity180 , from the @entity34 ' fraud and error service said cases such as @entity0 's cost taxpayers ' money			0
' the majority of people claiming benefits are honest , but there are some who abuse our welfare system and we will catch them , ' he said			0
' cases like this cost hardworking taxpayers money that should be used to help those in need			0
' @entity34 financial investigators are pursing @entity0 to recover the money that he has fraudulently claimed , and this will go back into the public purse			2
' ' if you suspect someone of benefit fraud , please call the @entity204 on 0800 854 440 so we can continue to tackle the problem in our area			0
