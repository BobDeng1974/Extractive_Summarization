by @entity0 published : 07:20 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 13:54 est , 26 march 2013 a rotund opera singer has lost an impressive five stone and is in training to complete a 300 mile charity cycle after adopting a caveman diet			1
@entity6 also took up @entity7 , the new fitness phenomenon involving constantly varied , high intensity workouts , and went from an unhealthy 19 stone and 40 per cent body fat to a fit and muscular 13 stone			1
part of the successful opera group @entity16 , @entity6 has performed across the globe , on multiple tv shows and even serenaded the @entity19 on the royal barge at her jubilee , but his confidence on stage has hidden a lifelong struggle with his weight			1
write caption here @entity6 , pictured second right with @entity16 members ( l - r ) @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , knew he had to loose weight to be fit for singing the 29 - year - old , who trained at the @entity33 , says although he was always large , he was very active as a child			1
‘ i was never taught about food as a child			0
i was never told how exactly people got fat			2
’ @entity6 , who played rugby and football throughout his childhood , says he began to over eat when his parents got divorced			2
‘ a lot of it was eating to comfort myself , ’ admits @entity6 , who also suffered bullying at school because of his size			1
‘ i ’d eat so much i would almost be sick , then start all over again			0
i ’d hate myself for doing it ’ he says			0
however , his high level of activity meant that @entity6 remained reasonably fit , and aged 18 , he was able to run the @entity51 for his little sister @entity52 , who was wheelchair bound throughout her childhood with me			1
@entity6 , seen here aged 7 , says he was never really taught about healthy nutrition as a child @entity6 was active in his childhood , but the weight still crept on due to his diet , especially during his gap years @entity6 at the end of a @entity63 workout , consisting of 30 handstand press ups , 40 pull ups , 50 24kg kettlebell swings , 60 sit - ups and 70 burpees with a time cap of 20 minutes ‘ i spoke to @entity52 about what it was like , about feeling each movement was a monumental effort and being trapped			1
it sounded a bit like ‘ hitting the wall ’ in a marathon			0
‘ i thought , if i can do the race , it ’s just a tiny bit of what she goes through everyday			0
’ despite completing this extreme physical feat @entity6 says the weight continued to pile on during his gap years , when he was singing in the @entity86 choir			1
@entity16 's success has seen them appear on numerous tv shows like @entity91 's @entity90			1
@entity6 explains that even in opera ' you have to look as good as you sound nowadays ' @entity6 adopted the @entity95 diet of basic , natural and largely unprocessed foods to get so svelte , though he still allows himself a ' fatterday ' each week working in a bakery in the day , @entity6 would start eating at the very start of the day , enjoying the pastries and breakfast foods the bistro served			1
‘ i could eat two walnut and maple pastries , then scrambled eggs with four or five slices of buttered toast just for breakfast			0
’ ‘ it was all beige food			0
then after i ’d sung in the choir we ’d head down the pub and i ’d have five or six pints			0
‘ there ’s a stereotype of the fat opera singer , but you actually need to be incredibly fit to sing			2
@entity6 aged 22 , just before he started at the @entity33 ‘ nowadays you have to look as good as you sound , ’ @entity6 explains			2
when he started at the @entity33 , weighing a hefty 19 stone , @entity6 realised if he was to continue to pursue his dream of becoming an opera singer on the global stage he would have to tackle his growing waistline			1
he adopted the @entity124 diet , often called the cave man diet , based on foods that might have been eaten by out hunter gatherer ancestors			2
@entity6 's diet shifted from high fat and sugar foods to natural unprocessed foods , with lots of protein			1
a typical days food became scrambled eggs , smoked mackerel and spinach for breakfast , chicken and steamed broccoli for lunch and a ‘ palaeo lasagne ’ , made without any pasta , for dinner			0
in addition @entity6 began ‘ @entity63 ’ , a fitness program , founded by @entity63 , that is fast growing in popularity , involving high intensity bouts of exercise for short periods , focusing on core strength			1
‘ workouts last for about 10 - 20 minutes each			1
the idea is to challenge your body so the workouts are constantly changing			0
‘ a lot of the exercises are functional , so they are designed to actually be helpful in everyday life			0
’ a session usually involved high impact cardio with weights as well as skill based exercises like working with @entity168 rings , handstands , push ups and burpies			0
‘ although each session is short , the high intensity means they are exhausting and really challenge your body			1
i ’m often on the floor at the end ! ’ says @entity6 , who began to notice the effects on his body almost immediately			2
with each month more and more people would comment on my weight loss			0
‘ but what surprised me was the comments about my attitude , how much more positive i was			0
’ @entity6 and @entity28 met @entity186 backstage at this years @entity188 awards			2
as @entity16 's success has continued , so has @entity6 's physical transformation it was during his time at the @entity33 that @entity6 met fellow @entity16 members @entity29 , @entity28 and @entity30 and formed the group			1
as they went from success to success , @entity6 ’s frame continued to shrink			2
each week he allows himself a day off his diet , which he calls ‘ fatterday ' , where he can eat exactly what he likes			0
@entity6 , seen here after completing the @entity202 10km assault course , says the biggest change has been in his attitude and confidence ‘ i ’m obsessed with @entity208 milkshakes so i usually make sure i get one of them in ! ‘ the feeling of health has over taken the feeling of vanity now , i love feeling physically fit			2
‘ the confidence i have gained is what motivates me to keep going			0
i find i ’m craving the bad foods less and less as time goes on			0
’ ‘ the only downside is none of my suits fit me anymore ! ’ he says			0
@entity6 is now using his new found fitness to raise money for cleft palette charity @entity223 by cycling 300 miles in three days			1
he is hoping to raise £ 2,400 which is enough for 16 children to have a life - changing operation			0
‘ in 3 days i will cover over 300 miles , and although it 's april , it 's most likely that it will be raining for at least two of the three days ! ‘ i was first introduced to @entity223 and their work , when ' @entity16 ' were invited to perform at their @entity230 last year			1
the commitment , energy and huge hearts of the staff and volunteers made me want to do something else to raise money and awareness of their work than just sing			0
@entity6 has pledged that he will cycle all the way home again if he reaches 3 times his original goal			1
