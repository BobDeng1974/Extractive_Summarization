@entity0 has vowed to ' keep the spotlight on @entity3 's appalling record in @entity4 ' the childhood memories of @entity6 welsh secretary @entity0 , the youngest member of the @entity7 , are rather different to those of @entity9 with his loving , stable family and the playing fields of @entity12			1
@entity0 ’s mother @entity13 fled the family home in @entity4 with her three sons after one violent row too many with her husband , @entity0 ’s father			1
@entity0 was just eight years old at the time			1
he was bullied at school because his mother could n’t afford a uniform			2
and he played truant to go potato - picking to raise the cash to buy a pair of trainers			2
‘ one of my earliest memories is of getting between my mother and father as he came at her with a knife – terrifying , ’ says @entity0 , talking to me in his @entity26 office			1
‘ there were other incidents when the police came around			2
my mother was basically living inside a prison suffering massive physical and emotional abuse			1
she literally scooped us up in her arms , we got on a train and went to @entity41			2
’ the promotion of @entity0 , 41 , to the @entity7 in july was not widely predicted			1
to put it bluntly , with only eight @entity45 , the prime minister ’s choice was limited			0
@entity0 ’s elevation to the @entity7 was noted mainly for him being the only member with a beard – and for getting rid of his ministerial @entity49 to save money			1
the crisis in the @entity52 , run by the @entity53 , is a golden opportunity for @entity0 to make his mark as a national figure			1
as a county - level schoolboy rugby player , he does not intend to drop the ball			0
‘ we have been saying for ages that the @entity3 - run @entity52 is a shambles			1
they are slipping behind in education too , and that is what will happen in the rest of the @entity67 if @entity68 wins power			0
i will keep the spotlight on @entity3 ’s appalling record in @entity4			1
’ ‘ @entity76 ’ , as he is known at @entity26 , is a @entity6 ‘ boy next door ’ version of @entity3 ’s @entity73 – sporty , neat and mild - mannered , and , like @entity73 , a bit too mild - mannered for some			1
but few @entity77 can match @entity0 ’s rise from a violent broken home and poverty in @entity3 - dominated @entity4 to a @entity6 seat at the @entity7			1
he has had virtually no contact with his father , who is still alive , since the family left in a hurry , even though they still both live in the same part of @entity88			2
when , by chance , @entity0 sees his father , they do not speak			1
‘ i have forgiven him now , ’ he says			0
‘ looking back , i can recognise some of the mental or psychological conditions , but as a child you do n’t know about that			0
it leaves many scars , but you ca n’t hold on to baggage like that			0
’ on arrival in the shipbuilding town of @entity101 near @entity102 , where his mother had fled to her parents ’ two - bedroom council flat , @entity0 and his brothers went to the local state school			1
they were the only ones with no uniform and were bullied for their ‘ @entity111 accent ’ ( @entity0 is from a part of @entity88 known as ‘ @entity114 ’ )			1
‘ i was in the town swimming baths and the lifeguard put his leg across the diving board ladder and said , “ no @entity111 on here ”			0
’ mr @entity0 pictured as a boy with his mother @entity13 life was little easier when the family returned to @entity4 after his mother found her feet			1
@entity0 was always interested in politics			1
‘ i was the nine - year - old kid who made a scrapbook of the @entity128 , ’ he laughs			0
but his mother ’s ordeal opened his eyes to a more profound political awakening			2
‘ she went from a breakdown and welfare to standing on her own two feet			0
that ’s why i am so passionate about our welfare reforms			0
she ’s a living example of welfare to work			2
’ by contrast , he says his father was mostly unemployed			2
‘ @entity142 and dependency is a curse on the @entity45 economy			0
@entity4 needs welfare reform more than anywhere else			1
but look who @entity3 are selecting for rock - solid safe seats			1
not local youngsters but @entity154 ’s son , @entity153 , the “ @entity153 ”			0
they do n’t speak for the working poor or anyone else			0
’ it is a rare flash of venom			0
‘ when people talk about hard choices between heating or eating or buying clothes , i know what it ’s like			2
i ’m not saying we lived in poverty in a cave , but there were a few christmases as kids when we relied on the kindness of friends and the church			0
‘ i hated having to queue up to be handed my plastic free meal token at my comp , @entity174 in @entity175			0
i nicked off school to pick potatoes to buy stuff like trainers			0
’ it was the 1980s , time of the miners ’ strike			0
@entity183 was a hate figure in much of @entity4 , but teenager @entity0 became a fan			1
‘ @entity186 was talking to the neighbours about the discount on their council house from @entity183 ’s right - to - buy scheme			0
unless you ’ve lived there you ca n’t appreciate how revolutionary it was for people who never thought they ’d own their own home			2
’ every saturday morning , @entity0 ’s mother took her sons to the library , saturday afternoons was for swimming , and on sundays she ‘ dragged ’ them to church			1
‘ they ’d take the p * * * out of me at school , but i ’m so grateful i went			0
i am a @entity205 and faith is important to me			0
’ @entity0 was no goodie - two - shoes and played lead guitar in a rock band that played the @entity211 ’ anarchy in the @entity67 , though he admits : ‘ we were pretty crap			1
’ while friends spent gap years in sunny @entity216 , @entity0 spent his living in a tent in @entity219 on the muddy @entity220 to work as a labourer in the town ’s docks			1
he met @entity225 wife @entity224 while studying at @entity226			0
‘ she was beautiful , so far out of my league , i learned @entity225 … ’ mr @entity0 pictured outside @entity228 on july 15 , the day he was promoted to the @entity7 just to have his wicked way with her ? ‘ to show her i was serious , ’ he laughs			1
‘ one summer i got my final pay packet from a building site in @entity234 , took the overnight ferry , got a train to @entity237 , slept on a park bench and made my way by bus and train to her home in the @entity243 in the @entity244			0
she said “ @entity245 ”			0
’ the couple now have two children , aged 13 and ten			0
after working for charities and in marketing , @entity0 became the mp for @entity252 in @entity88 in 2005			2
he knows his @entity7 break came partly because @entity9 needs to play down the @entity254 ’ silver - spoon image			2
@entity0 puts it his own way : ‘ if you ca n’t speak with authenticity to those with the least in society , you ’ve no right to go up the driveways of those with more			2

@entity0 recalls moment his father tried to attack mother with knife
' my mother was basically living inside a prison suffering massive abuse '
to many people 's *surprise* , mr @entity0 was promoted to the @entity7 in july
he vows to ' keep the spotlight on @entity3 's appalling record in @entity4 '
