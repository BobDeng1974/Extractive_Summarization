ever wanted to eat whatever you want without worrying about calories ? it may sound too good to be true but if one man has his way , this could be the future of food			0
@entity8 is a gastronomic virtual reality experiment using @entity11 headsets , cutlery with sensors , low - calorie foods and aromatic diffusers to mimic the taste of the real thing			1
if the experiment proves successful , being prevented from eating whatever you like due to food allergies and dietary restrictions will become a thing of the past			0
@entity8 uses virtual reality headsets and low calorie food to mimic steak , pie and lasagne the brainchild of @entity31 based @entity32 , the project was inspired by a scene in the film @entity36 , in which @entity37 learns to use his imagination to see food on a table that appears empty at first			1
so successful have experiments been , @entity41 , 30 , the founder of @entity32 believes @entity8 could pioneer a new way of eating			1
‘ i 've been disappointed by the fact that our way of eating has n't changed much since the beginning of time and i wanted others to realise that they do n't have to follow the status quo , ’ he told @entity45			0
‘ i also want to make it clear that i do n't want this to replace the way we consume food			0
it 's simply another alternative			0
’ an alternative to the way we eat , @entity8 will let you eat wherever you want to , be it in the middle of a desert ( pictured ) or standing in the street of a bustling city full of people and moving objects motion and food detection sensor work with aromatic diffusers to mimic a broad spectrum of food currently in its early stages , the experiment is a complete sensory experience that uses virtual reality headsets and special cutlery with sensors to create environments based on real locations			1
this is then combined with low - calorie foods derived from agar , konjac jelly and gum @entity90 , which mimic foods such as steak , lasagne , pies and sushi			1
aromatic diffusions also come into play , making it possible to smell your virtual steak before you tuck into it			1
‘ we 've began prototyping the object detection sensor for chopsticks and fork , as well as the virtual reality software using @entity107 and @entity11 , ’ mr @entity41 explained			1
‘ our first demo will feature an environment based a fictional place that is set in the past and future of @entity113			2
you 'll be able to eat in the middle of the bustling city full of people and moving objects			0
‘ we 've also been experimenting with water to agar ratio and layering thin sheets of agar ( like lasagna ) to achieve different textures of the virtual foods			2
’ virtual sushi , steak and pie are made from low - calorie gum @entity90 , konjac jelly and agar @entity8 was inspired by a scene in the film @entity36 in which @entity37 learns to use his imagination to see foods on a table that seems to be completely empty at first founder of @entity32 , @entity41 ( pictured ) believes the experiment could pioneer a new way of eating on the menu and currently being trialled are dishes such as sushi , steak , lasagne and pie			1
‘ so far , we 've been focusing our efforts on sushi , steak , lasagna and pie since they have relatively simple geometry and large flat surface areas -- which means they 're easier to detect using our sensors , ’ mr @entity41 continued			1
‘ the foods that have irregular shapes , have many chunks and fall apart easily will be the hardest to mimic			2
' most likely , we will stay away from foods like rice pudding , sweet and sour chicken , and salad			2
’ he hopes to begin further testing later this year			0
‘ we expect to have our first alpha sometime in the middle of the year			0
if we can get more funding soon , we can probably have it sooner			0
' currently , i 'm funding it out of my own pocket , so there are some challenges			0
