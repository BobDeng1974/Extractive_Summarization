by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 11:28 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 05:05 est , 17 september 2013 @entity2 has been found selling pork chops labelled as @entity4 that are actually likely to have come from @entity5			1
the discovery represents a major embarrassment for the supermarket as it comes after claims that the sourcing of meat had been cleaned up following the horsemeat scandal			2
earlier this year , @entity2 and others were found to have sold beef burgers that actually contained high levels of cheap horse meat from eastern @entity17			1
genetic tests : examination of @entity2 pork chops labelled as @entity4 show they came from @entity5 ( file picture ) at the time , the company promised a major overhaul of its supply system with a shift to support @entity4 farmers and carry out stringent checks on the origin of its meat			1
however , tests carried out on one pack of fresh pork chops carrying the @entity36 logo , which is designed to identify @entity4 food , showed it was imported , most likely from @entity5			1
the discovery was made by a @entity41 investigation for the @entity42 and @entity44 programmes , where a researcher bought packs of chops from a @entity2 in @entity48			1
the samples were sent to laboratories in @entity51 as part of a joint exercise with the @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , which promotes @entity4 pork farming			1
these tests , known as @entity58 , are able to identify the country of origin of meat based on its composition			1
the results suggested there was less than a 1per cent chance that the two pork chops actually came from @entity4			2
apology : @entity2 said they were extremely disappointed to discover a pork loin product bought by a researcher probably came from a @entity71 farm , rather than a @entity4 farm as labelled ( file picture ) @entity2 , @entity4 ’s largest supermarket , said : ‘ we are extremely disappointed to discover a pork loin product probably came from a @entity71 farm , not a @entity4 farm			1
‘ when we specify that we want @entity4 pork , we expect to be supplied with @entity4 pork			0
we have spoken with our supplier to make clear that this mistake is unacceptable			0
’ the supplier , @entity82 , said it had reviewed its systems and had told its customers they can be confident its products are correctly labelled			0
it said the meat involved came from another supplier , @entity87 , a family - owned meat company in @entity89			2
however , the firm denied responsibility , saying it does not deal with @entity71 meat			2
‘ we correctly label the products we sell to our customers and we have the documentation to prove this , ’ it said			0
the @entity55 director , @entity98 , described the false label as an isolated case			0
‘ human error can occur			0
this is not going to happen on a regular basis , ’ he said			0
‘ i think we have shown that this technology works and it provides an extra level of reassurance for consumers in the traceability systems that we adopt. ’			0

the product with a @entity36 *symbol* on it was bought by a researcher
@entity115 tells the consumer the product was reared in this country
but meat was sent for tests in @entity51 where the origin was discovered
@entity2 said they were ' extremely disappointed ' about the findings
