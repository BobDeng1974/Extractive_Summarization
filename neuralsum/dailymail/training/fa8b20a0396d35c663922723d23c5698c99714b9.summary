we were away and were told over the phone by a police officer			0
@entity88 was just a normal lad , we are a normal family ; surely it would n’t happen to us , but it has			0
' @entity88 had a massive amount of friends			0
he was so cheeky ; always laughing and joking			0
that ’s something we ’ll never have again			0

those who have never met @entity5 will form opinions based on the last few hours of his life			1
' however those of us who had the privilege of knowing and loving him knew what a fantastic , young person he was who lived his life to the full , had a great work ethic , was caring and thoughtful with a wicked sense of humour			0

' drivers need to be aware that regardless of the time of day they are caught , whether they are going to work or taking children to school , they will face the same penalties as someone who has chosen to drink heavily in a pub and driven at night			2
' last year 280 people were killed across the country in accidents where the driver was over the limit			2
