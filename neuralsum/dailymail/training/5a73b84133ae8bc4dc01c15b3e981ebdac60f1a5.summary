by @entity0 published : 17:06 est , 4 november 2013 @entity2 : 12:30 est , 5 november 2013 shock : @entity4 , 59 , was exceptionally fit for his age , so he was astounded to learn not only that he had breast cancer but that he needed a mastectomy as a well - informed , health - conscious man , @entity4 knew that men his age should be on the lookout for signs of prostate or bowel cancer			1
he never imagined that he 'd have to worry about breast cancer			1
but one evening just before @entity16 last year , while taking a shower , @entity4 noticed a small lump under his right nipple , about the size of a tiny pea			1
it was causing no pain or discomfort , so he thought nothing more of it			2
' i assumed it was a cyst and that it would go away			2
i knew i was fit , and i had no previous medical conditions , so there was nothing to make me worried , ' says @entity4 , 59			2
at the time , he was looking forward to an exciting new chapter in his life			2
he and his wife , @entity33 - with whom he has two children , both in their 20s - were enjoying life in their new apartment in @entity39 and having the occasional visit to the @entity41 , where they have a house in @entity44 , @entity45			1
they were planning to see more of the world together because @entity4 had opted for semi-retirement two years earlier after more than 22 years working in finance , latterly as chief financial officer for the international division of @entity51			2
@entity4 was exceptionally fit for his age , having clocked up ten marathons and 50 half - marathons , in addition to playing cricket and football to a high standard in his youth			0
when he went for a routine medical in @entity39 in january , he mentioned the lump in his breast in passing			2
he was given an ultrasound scan , but the surgeon to whom @entity4 was referred could n't tell what it was			0
he says : ' when i got the ultrasound images i emailed them to @entity33 , who at the time was back in @entity70			0
i also sent them to my 26 - year - old son @entity72 , who 's a medical student			2
there was no panic at all on my part			0
i just thought @entity72 might find the images interesting			0
' @entity72 found them deeply worrying - and immediately telephoned his mother , who spoke to her gp			0
' i was given the name of @entity81 , a breast cancer specialist at the @entity83 , and made an appointment to see him , ' says @entity33			1
' i did my homework and felt strongly that it was , in fact , cancer			2
but the hard part was getting @entity4 to concentrate and treat the issue urgently			0
i told him to get on a plane			0
' spreading the word : @entity4 and his wife @entity33 want to increase awareness of male breast cancer it was only when he and @entity33 walked into mr @entity81 's consulting room in mid-april , a full month after the medical , that @entity4 realised the gravity of his situation			1
' @entity81 said he was 99 per cent certain it was cancer and that the normal treatment is a mastectomy , ' says @entity4			2
' i reeled in shock			0
i knew that men could get breast cancer , but i had no idea what a mastectomy would involve for a man			1
' in those first few days i went through many emotions - anger , sadness , self - pity , a sense of “ why me ? ” then i thought : “ i can get through this			0
” ' breast cancer in women has been one of the success stories of health campaigning , with most now knowing to regularly check their breasts for changes			1
but what 's far less well known is that the disease also affects men - around 370 in the @entity41 a year			1
as for women , early detection raises the chances of successful treatment			2
' the prognosis for men with breast cancer is worse than it is for women , but we do n't know why , ' says mr @entity81			1
' it 's also the case that breast cancer in men often goes undetected for longer because the disease does not register with men as it does with women			1
' research suggests men who have breast cancer in the family are at raised risk ( there is no history of it in @entity4 's )			1
' i reeled in shock			0
i knew that men could get breast cancer , but i had no idea what a mastectomy would involve for a man			1
' another known cause is a rare genetic condition called @entity160 's syndrome , where men are born with an extra x ( female ) chromosome			2
lifestyle factors , such as obesity , lack of exercise and high alcohol intake might also increase the risk of male breast cancer , although this has n't yet been established for certain			1
professor @entity171 , from the @entity172 , has been carrying out a study on 1,000 men with breast cancer across @entity70 and @entity176 since 2007			1
' we have already found several genetic factors associated with risk , and are optimistic that we can find a great deal more about the cause of this cancer in men , ' he says			1
thankfully , in @entity4 's case , his cancer was caught early enough to be successfully treated			2
within 24 hours of seeing mr @entity81 , he was booked in for surgery and had the operation a week later			0
a mastectomy is essentially the same for both men and women , but in @entity4 's case the cancer had spread into his armpits to the lymph nodes , and they had to be removed , too			1
the four - hour operation was successful , but then there was a wait while the lymph nodes were sent to the @entity198 for testing with a technique called @entity200			0
this can predict the chances of a tumour returning and , therefore , establish how effective chemotherapy would be			0
' no one wants chemo unless it 's absolutely necessary , ' says mr @entity81			0
' on the other hand , no one wants to risk a recurrence , which is why women and men should be offered this test to help them decide			1
' the @entity214 rationing body , the @entity215 , has recommended that breast cancer patients in @entity41 should be offered the @entity200 , and a decision is due next month			1
@entity4 's results showed that the chances of the cancer returning were low , so he did n't need chemotherapy , sparing him the gruelling treatment			2
male victims : breast cancer affects around 370 men in the @entity41 each year this was a great relief , he says , since his son @entity72 's wedding was planned for early august , and @entity4 had visions of himself in the official photographs either bald or wearing a wig			1
instead , @entity4 was prescribed @entity234 , a drug often given to women with breast cancer as it suppresses production of the hormone oestrogen , which is known to fuel the growth of cancer cells			1
men have lower levels of oestrogen , but still enough to keep cancer cells alive			1
@entity4 expects to take @entity234 for ten years			0
some patients suffer side - effects such as hot flushes and weight gain , but not @entity4			0
in fact , he has shed about 20lb since the operation , mainly through better diet and exercising			0
not only did he attend his son 's wedding with a full head of hair and a clean bill of health , but - to the surprise even of mr @entity81 - nine weeks after his surgery he went ahead with a 1,000 - mile cycle ride from @entity261 to @entity262 , planned before he became ill. ' my wife thought i was bonkers and she was probably right ' says @entity4			0
' but @entity81 was supportive , otherwise i would not have done it			0
' @entity4 secured £ 6,500 for @entity266 , a small charity in the @entity268 area that raises money for equipment to diagnose and treat breast cancer			1
he has not had any reconstructive surgery ( reconstruction is uncommon in male patients )			0
@entity4 's chest on this side is flatter			0
but that does n't bother him , and his scar is ' merging nicely into the background '			0
but what @entity4 and @entity33 do n't want to fade away is the importance of making people more aware of breast cancer in men			1
@entity33 says : ' in the beginning , i think he thought : “ how can i tell people i have breast cancer , because that 's a woman 's disease ? ” i told him he would be a trail - blazer and that he could help other men			1
' @entity4 is now happy to talk openly about his experience			0
' the fact that men can get breast cancer at all is seldom mentioned , ' he says			1
' and that means there 's a big chance it will go undetected			2
' i 'm one of the lucky ones			0
now i want to do something about it			0

breast cancer affects around 370 men in the @entity41 a year
the prognosis for men with the disease is worse than it is for women
it also goes undetected in men for longer because of lack of awareness
lifestyle factors ( obesity , lack of exercise ) might increase the risk in men
