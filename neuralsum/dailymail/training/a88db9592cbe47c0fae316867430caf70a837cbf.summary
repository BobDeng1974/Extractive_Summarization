by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor parents who continue to cook for children who have grown up or left home have been blamed for fuelling @entity6 ’s food waste crisis			1
dubbed ‘ hotel parents ’ , mothers and fathers whose children treat their home ‘ like a hotel ’ routinely cook dinner for them only for it to end up in the bin , a parliamentary inquiry has been told			1
it comes as ministers accuse the public of ‘ ignorance ’ about best before dates and what to do with leftovers			0
binned : many meals end up being thrown away because parents have cooked for children who do not come home for dinner , a council has claimed every year families in the @entity6 throw away 7.2million of food , including spending £ 12billion on food which could have been eaten but ends up in the bin			1
households are responsible for half of all the food waste every year , according to official figures			1
in the past officials have blamed supermarkets for buy - one - get - one - free offers to encourage people to buy too much food , or confusing use by dates which mean perfectly edible food is thrown away			2
environment secretary @entity46 told @entity47 : ‘ the fact is it is shocking really in this day and age that good food is thrown away , partly out of ignorance and party out of aesthetics			1
appalling : environment secretary @entity46 blamed public ' ignorance ' for the scale of food waste in @entity6 ' we throw away an appalling amount of food away , it 's 15million tonnes - a - year			1
' one of my enthusiasm is to see that it does n’t go to land fill but is processed in some way			0
’ mr @entity46 is backing anaerobic digestion , which used food or farm waste to generate heat or electric power			1
but a @entity73 inquiry into food waste has been told that parents struggling to adjust to their children leaving home , or seeking independence , are also adding to the problem			1
new figures yesterday showed a sharp rise in the number of homes with more than one family living as the ‘ boomerang generation ’ of young people comes back to live with their parents			2
@entity89 told peers that many too much food is wasted because parents still cook meals for children who have grown up			1
‘ there are so called “ hotel parents ” , those with older children who treat their homes like a hotel , ' it said			2
‘ these parents often have to deal with fluctuating household numbers that make planning meals difficult , ’ the @entity102 subcommittee on @entity103 was told			2
‘ empty nesters also have difficulty adjusting to fewer people being at home for meals and still cook the same size portions , as do those who sadly have to adjust to bereavement			1
’ with house prices rising and the under - 30s unable to afford a home in large parts of the country , many even with partners and children are forced to move in with the in - laws			2
there are now 286,000 multi-family households in the @entity6 , up from 193,000 in 2006			1
analysts say they are the fastest - growing household type , rising by 40 per cent in a decade			0
boom : the number of multi-family households has soared since the recession , with couples forced to move in with the in - laws to afford to buy a home shropshire council added that people who do not write a shopping list before leaving the house also buy too much , or the wrong food , while most people routinely cook too much rice or pasta			1
it said its claims were based on ' thousands of conversations ' with local people at public events , radio phone - ins and cookery demonstrations			0
the warning is echoed by the @entity147 which claimed too few people know how to turn leftovers into an edible meal			0
in evidence to the committee , @entity147 said : ‘ at household level , the main reasons for food waste are buying , cooking , preparing or serving too much : including not knowing what to do with leftovers and also food not used in time or that has gone past its use by date			2
’ the government ’s @entity165 is offering people recipes on how to turn excess food into a meal on the next day			0
@entity170 found that 68 per cent of its bagged salads , 48 per cent of its bakery goods and 24 per cent of its grapes go to waste the @entity177 has also pointed to other countries working to teach people about cooking with leftovers			0
both the @entity182 farmers ’ women association and the @entity185 farmers ’ association have backed campaigns making clear that some food is called ‘ too good for the garbage bin ’			0
last week @entity170 admitted up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin			0
the retail giant found that 68 per cent of its bagged salads , 48 per cent of its bakery goods and 24 per cent of its grapes go to waste			0
much of the food is thrown away by customers – but large amounts are lost because they have been on display too long			0
yet more produce has to be ditched before it even reaches shelves .			0
