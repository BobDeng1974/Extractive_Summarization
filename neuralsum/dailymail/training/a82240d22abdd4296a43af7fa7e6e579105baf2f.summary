by @entity0 published : 15:10 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 16:27 est , 19 december 2012 this dazzling miniature fish is one of over 100 weird and wonderful new species that have been discovered in @entity4 - along with a singing frog , a ' walking ' catfish , and a devilish looking bat			1
the borarus naevus fish , which measures just 2cm in length , was spotted off the coast of @entity11 in southern @entity12 , and is one of a host of new creatures found in the @entity16 during the course of 2011			1
the tiny fish was named for the large dark blotch on the side of its body			2
@entity22 is the latin word for blemish			0
this and all 125 other discoveries in the region last year are detailed in a report from conservation organisation the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , entitled @entity50			1
rivalling the bat for the title of weirdest looking discovery is the ' clarias gracilentus ' or ' walking ' catfish that was found in freshwater streams on the @entity38 island of @entity57			2
while the catfish can not actually walk , it can move over land using its pectoral fins to stay upright while wriggling forwards with snake - like movements			0
@entity64 : the ' @entity65 ' tube - nosed bat , discovered in central @entity38 , was named for its devilish appearance @entity69 customer : the ' walking catfish ' was found living in freshwater streams on the island of @entity57 off the @entity38 @entity74 province of @entity75 new species : while the so - called ' walking catfish ' ca n't actually walk , it has the ability to use its pectoral fins to stay upright while it wriggles forwards using snake - like movements a new species of tree frog discovered in the forests of northern @entity38 boasts a complex call that makes it sound more like a bird than a typical frog			1
rather than using repetitive croaks , the ' sweet singing ' frog spins a new tune each time , with each individual frog mixing clicks , whistles and chirps in a unique order			2
another frog spotted in southern @entity38 , ' leptobrachium leucops ' , has striking black and white eyes			0
also among the array of reptiles discovered in the region during 2011 was the red - eyed green pit viper , found in forests close to @entity104 in @entity38			0
warbler : the sweet singing frog ( @entity105 ) was discovered in the high - altitude forests of northern @entity38 eye - catching : the ' yin - yang ' frog ( @entity110 leucops ) is one of five new species discovered in the @entity74 region last year @entity114 , manager of @entity116 's @entity115 , said the fascinating creatures emphasised the need for investment in conservation in order to protect the future of new discoveries , as well as other intriguing species that currently remain unknown			1
' while the 2011 discoveries affirm the @entity116 as a region of astonishing bidoversity , many new species are already struggling to survive in shrinking habitats , ' said mr @entity114			1
' only by investing in nature conservation , especially protected areas , and developing greener economics , will we see these new species protected and keep alive the hope of finding other intriguing species in years to come , ' he added			0
in particular , the tube - nosed bat depends on tropical forest for its survival and is especially vulnerable to deforestation			0
to date , 30 per cent of the @entity116 's forests have disappeared within four decades			2
the @entity49 singled out @entity36 ' ongoing construction of the @entity143 on the main stream of the @entity145 - which supports around 850 fish species - as a ' significant ' threat to the region 's extraordinary biodiversity			1
' the @entity145 supports levels of aquatic biodiversity second only to the @entity152 , ' mr @entity114 said			0
' the @entity143 would prove an impassable barrier for many fish species , signalling the demise for wildlife already known and as yet undiscovered			0
