@entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , is normally known for it collection of paintings , silver and sculptures			2

' circuit : a @entity19 ' has opened at the @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7			2
the delicate strands of illuminated wire create an eerie effect @entity25 , 9 , walks around the new light installation created by @entity27 and @entity28			1
visitors walk through as sounds , music and snatches of conversation are played to them a young boy walks through the light labyrinth in @entity6			1
alongside the lights artist @entity28 says visitors can enjoy an " aural tapestry reminiscent of @entity6 with echoes of our own time " artists @entity28 and @entity27 took over the open space for their project which is made up of delicate strands of different coloured lights which create a web - like maze of light			1
while in the maze , visitors hear sounds , music and snatches of conversation which are designed to be ' reminiscent of @entity6 '			2
mr @entity27 said ' @entity51 was once an hotel that led into adjacent eighteenth century pleasure gardens which were frequented by patrons who enjoyed grottos , illuminations , a labyrinth and perhaps a saucy dalliance in the protective shadows			0
' we hope to create an engaging visual and aural experience for all ages to participate within , which will engender echoes of history and place , providing an engaging , transformative experience of the garden of the @entity68 as turns are taken and turned again			0
' spooky ... a man in a head torch creates a beacon in the ' @entity19 ' as he explores the installation in @entity6 , @entity7 the movement of light creates patterns in a similar way to sparklers on fireworks night as visitors interact with the art work ' circuit : a @entity19 ' surrounds one of the buildings at the @entity5 in @entity6			1

the installation opened on wednesday november 28 and will run until january 2013			0
the web like maze is created using different coloured electroluminescent wire while music and conversation snippets are played to create a ' sound picture ' , mr @entity28 says nine - year - old @entity25 looks almost ethereal as he wanders through the light wires people wear head torches and carry glow sticks as they navigate their way around the maze up close the wires look like a confusing mass of colour and light the lights look less impressive in the day time as you can see the poles which used to hold the installation in place and the loops of extra wire @entity122 creates light trails as he plays with a glow stick as darkness begins to fall the glow stick lights the way for @entity25 as he wanders through the wires which almost come up to his head at the @entity5 visitors carry glow sticks so as they move they add to the other - worldly effect for those looking into the maze of electric wires the piece uses both light and sound to create what artist @entity28 calls an ' aural tapestry ' which combines the old with the new			1

visitors can walk through the light maze at the @entity5 in @entity6
