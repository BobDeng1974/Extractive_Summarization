@entity1 boss @entity0 has demanded an apology from out - of - favour defender @entity3			1
the @entity4 international , who is a fans ' favourite and the club 's longest serving player , has featured just six times this season and has not been seen since the @entity11 defeat on november 8			1
since then relations appear to have deteriorated significantly , with the 28 - year - old sent to train with the development squad			0
@entity0 has vented his fury after @entity3 tweeted about being demoted by the @entity1 boss @entity3 sent this tweet on friday revealing his demotion to training with the @entity20 21 side @entity0 's @entity22 side have been in free fall since reaching the @entity25 final last season he has also taken to retweeting fan comments about his continued exile , an act which has not gone down well with his manager			1
and while @entity0 would not elaborate on the precise reasons for the current stand - off he was clear that there was only one way to resolve it			2
' i heard all this nonsense about what 's on @entity37 and the rest of it but it 's quite straightforward : @entity3 knows exactly why he 's training with the under - 21 squad at the moment , ' said @entity0			1
' he 's been quite quick to reveal that he is in there and i hope he comes out and tells the reason why			0
' if he apologises to myself and to the squad then he will come back into the fold			0
it 's entirely up to @entity3			1
' unless @entity3 works quickly he can expect to miss out once more against former club @entity47 on @entity48			2
@entity3 has featured just six times this season and has not played since facing @entity11 in november @entity0 admits that there is still a place for @entity3 in the first - team if he apologises for his actions with loanee @entity55 also having played his last game for an unimpressed @entity0 , @entity58 and @entity59 both suspended and @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 all injured , there is as much first - team talent unavailable as fit and ready for action			1
@entity0 is eager for captain @entity65 to pull through after suffering a calf injury against @entity67 last weekend			2
' we do n't know about @entity65 , we 'll have to see how he is , but he is extremely sore , ' he added			0
to combat the team 's personnel troubles , @entity0 has recalled @entity71 and @entity72 from their respective loan spells at @entity74 and @entity75			1
neither player were knocking down the door before being sent away earlier this season , but may well find themselves involved in the busy festive period			0
' @entity71 and @entity72 have trained with us for the first time on tuesday , ' said @entity0			0
' we needed them to get games			0
they 've had a few but not as many as i 'd like , and , with the injuries and suspensions , we welcome them back			0

@entity3 has been made to train with @entity1 's @entity20 side
the @entity4 *midfielder* tweeted about his demotion
@entity22 manager @entity0 was *annoyed* at @entity3 's tweets
but he will welcome the defender back if he makes an apology
