the slain editor of @entity1 has slammed his left - wing critics from beyond the grave for criticising publication of drawings of @entity6			0
in a book @entity7 , known as @entity8 , finished just two days before being murdered by jihadist gunmen he argued that left - leaning intellectuals who denounced the cartoons in the satirical magazine were ‘ ridiculous demagogues ’ for doing so			1
in the short book , extracts of which are to be published today in weekly magazine @entity18 , he writes : ‘ the suggestion that you can laugh at everything , except certain aspects of @entity24 , because @entity25 are much more susceptible than the rest of the population , what is that , if not discrimination ? in a book @entity7 ( pictured ) , known as @entity8 , finished just two days before being mowed down by jihadist gunmen he argued that left - leaning intellectuals who denounced the cartoons in the satirical magazine were ‘ ridiculous demagogues ’ journalists hold placards reading ' i am @entity38 ' as they hold a minute of silence on january 7 following the attack by gunmen in the offices of @entity1 ‘ it 's time to finish with this disgusting paternalism of the white , left - wing bourgeois intellectual seeking to prove himself among the “ poor unfortunate undereducated ”			1
’ the book , @entity49 aux @entity48 ( @entity50 to the @entity51 who play into @entity53 ) , which may well rock the ' @entity38 ' solidarity over the massacre , argues that some intellectuals who condemned the drawings were merely attention - seekers			1
it says : ‘ since i am educated , i understand that @entity1 is using humour			0
but out of respect for you [ @entity25 ] , since you have n't yet discovered second - degree humour , i will denounce these islamophobic drawings that i pretend not to understand			0
i will put myself at your level to show that i love you			0
‘ these ridiculous demagogues just have a huge need to be the centre of attention and want to satisfy their formidable fantasy to dominate others			0
’ @entity8 asks why @entity72 , which technically means ‘ fear of @entity24 ’ , is being used by activists , media and politicians to denounce hatred of @entity25 and wonders why ‘ @entity72 ’ is not used instead , or simply ‘ racism ’			1
he argues that ‘ a lot of those who campaign against @entity72 do n't actually do it to defend @entity25 as individuals , but to defend @entity6 's religion ’			1
@entity1 ’s satirical attacks on @entity24 drove two brothers , @entity86 and @entity87 ( pictured ) to mount a deadly attack on its office in @entity90 @entity8 also takes a pop at religion , and particularly at believers			0
‘ the problem is not the @entity95 or the @entity97 - sleep - inducing , incoherent and badly written novels - but the faithful who read the @entity95 or the @entity97 like you read assembly instructions for @entity102 shelves , ’ he writes			1
he condemns those who are ready to ‘ cut the infidel 's throats along the dotted line otherwise @entity107 will deprive me of @entity109 in the afterlife ’ , according to the @entity111			2
he blames the media for helping popularise the term ‘ @entity72 ’ because ‘ any scandal that contains the word @entity24 in its title sells			1
’ ‘ a terrorist is scary , but if you add that he 's an @entity120 , everyone wets themselves			2
’ and he also takes a dig at politicians whom he accuses of seeing muslims where they should see regular citizens , and wanting to pander to a ‘ @entity25 electorate ’			2
‘ that 's saying that the majority of @entity25 do n't decide their vote according to the candidates ' political ideas but according to the degree of sympathy they display towards @entity25 , ’ he argues			2
@entity8 also defends @entity1 's controversial depictions of the prophet and extremism over the years , which earned it accusations of @entity72			2
chillingly , he refers to @entity143 's @entity142 magazine which in 2013 published a list of 11 people accused of ‘ crimes against @entity24 ’ and wanted ‘ dead or alive ’			1
‘ i find my name , badly spelled but accompanied by a photo where you can recognise my alarmed face ’ -- a picture he said was taken when the offices of the magazine were burnt down in 2011 shortly after a special edition was published under the title @entity157			1
‘ the skillful montage is titled “ @entity159 ” and below you can read : “ a bullet a day keeps the infidel away ”			0
’ @entity1 ’s satirical attacks on @entity24 drove two brothers , @entity86 and @entity87 to mount a deadly attack on its office in @entity90			0
they burst into an editorial meeting on january 7 , peppering @entity8 and nine other cartoonists with bullets before calmly leaving			0
they also shot dead a maintenance worker and a policeman who tried to stop them .			0

@entity7 finished a book just two days before he was killed
the book blames the media for helping popularise the term ‘ @entity72 ’
extracts from it are being published today in weekly magazine @entity18
