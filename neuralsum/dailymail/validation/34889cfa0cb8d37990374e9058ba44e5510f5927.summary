@entity0 is convinced success is on the horizon for @entity3 on the day when he saw former team @entity5 return to glory			1
after missing the season - opening @entity9 @entity8 as he recovered from a concussion sustained in a test crash , @entity0 's first outing on his return to the team ended in retirement after 21 laps of the @entity17 @entity8 due to an @entity19 cooling issue			1
as @entity0 spoke and delivered his verdict on the weekend when @entity3 have at least made some progress , @entity20 was charging around in the background en route to his first win for 16 months			2
@entity3 driver @entity0 is all smiles in @entity17 despite not finishing the @entity8 on sunday @entity0 's @entity3 is wheeled into the garage after he was forced to retire from the @entity17 @entity8 the @entity28 is , of course , @entity0 's replacement at @entity5 as the 33 - year - old opted to quit the @entity33 marque after five years without success of trying to claim a third title			1
what must @entity0 have thought later when he saw @entity20 stand on the top step of the podium , the first time a @entity5 driver had done so since the @entity41 himself in his home grand prix two years ago			2
whatever @entity0 's thoughts , all he can do now is remain convinced @entity3 's early woes in conjunction with new power - unit supplier @entity48 will ultimately lead to the results he craves			1
it is a case of short - term pain for long - term gain as @entity0 said : ' these reliability problems are normal			0
the @entity41 failed to finish the race on sunday , managing just 21 laps at the @entity17 @entity8 ' what you normally find in winter testing , we have to find in the first couple of races unfortunately			1
we need to accept maybe some retirements and we are ready to do so			0
' definitely it has been a very nice weekend and a very nice surprise to see the improvements from @entity9 to here			0
' if we keep up this rate then we will enjoy success very soon			0
' overall , @entity0 expressed ' mixed feelings ' as to how the weekend had unfolded , adding : ' i 'm happy to be back and very happy with the progress the team has made			0
both @entity3 's failed to finish the race in @entity17 as they continue to struggle for form this @entity75 season ' watching the race on the tv in @entity9 , we were very far off - four seconds in the race and just one @entity3 running alone at the back			2
' here we were much more competitive in qualifying , running with everyone in the race , which was a very nice surprise			0
' but not finishing the race is never a nice feeling , so let 's see if we can improve next time			0
' team - mate @entity86 retired on lap 42 with a turbo issue , leaving neither of the team 's cars classified for the first time since the 2006 @entity91			1

both @entity3 drivers forced to retire at @entity17 @entity8
neither @entity3 finished for the first time since the 2006 @entity96 @entity8
