the decent thing for the @entity2 league to do would be crafting a medal and a trophy for the club which finishes fourth next may			1
despite more than a dozen different @entity2 teams having qualified for the @entity8 during the last 12 years — with @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all having either reached or won @entity15 finals during that span — and particularly with @entity10 having broken the duopoly by winning the title last term , this is the season when there will most certainly only be one @entity8 slot up for grabs			1
big money : @entity24 paid £ 75m to sign @entity25 from @entity26 certain one - eyed critics got stuck in such a rut talking about a two - horse race in @entity2 that they were soundly exposed by @entity33 ’s title - winning side last season			1
however , just in case anyone should be sufficiently effervescent to imagine that @entity10 were , vicariously , trampling down the door to the hegemony on behalf of other aspiring ‘ could have been a contender ’ clubs — think again			1
@entity10 ’s spend this summer simply confirms that they have attacked the duopoly not on behalf of liberté , fraternité and égalité but in order to create a triumvirate at the top of @entity2 soccer			1
right now the champions have invested close to € 100 million , against which their accountants can balance the sales of @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			0
but it ’s jaw - dropping that between @entity10 , @entity58 and @entity24 , the total gross expenditure on new players supersedes € 350m			1
wild though it seems , there are rumours abounding that @entity10 will add the purchase of the exceptional @entity63 to their tally			1
and even before you examine how that would push the three clubs ’ spending close to the € 400m mark , the key to that deal — should they pull it off — is how a club which still had to pre-qualify for the @entity72 when they signed @entity73 and which was flirting with relegation when they recruited @entity33 as manager two - and - a - half years ago could now fight off all of @entity79 ’s premier clubs to sign this utter gem of a @entity82 footballer ? right now these are reports , not hard facts , so let ’s leave it at that			0
but the idea of @entity63 being snapped up by @entity10 fits with the theme which @entity58 and @entity24 have established			1
enough , already , with the ‘ which league is better ? ’ , despite the repeated claims by those who receive the @entity94 pound that it is the best in the world			0
value the product you watch ( or participate in ) precisely as you wish but something intriguing happened in @entity2 this summer			1
like him or loathe him , @entity25 can play a bit			2
when he abandoned @entity26 , it was to @entity24 he was determined to go			2
not @entity102 , @entity103 or @entity104			0
prime mover : @entity58 midfielder @entity106 boasts talent and experience arguably , @entity109 was the player of the @entity110			1
a fabulous technical and creative talent just approaching the prime years of his career and now world champion to go with his @entity116 and @entity8 titles			0
prime beef , but when he was on the hoof it was to @entity58 he went — and remarkably cheaply as well			2
how did @entity123 ’s leading clubs miss out on him ? why on earth did he choose to leave the ‘ football nirvana ’ which @entity127 is attempting to create in @entity128 — a process which has notably improved @entity109 in the space of one season ? then , @entity132			2
a special talent and one who illuminated the @entity110			0
there ’s no doubt that the special nature of his performance there will have over-inflated people ’s expectations of him			0
this is a kid who has all the weaponry but needs some time on the firing range			0
he did n’t dominate @entity151 football at @entity152 — but with maturity and exceptional team - mates around him , it ’s predictable that we are about to see the blossoming of a special footballer			2
just right for @entity102 , @entity160 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity26 — but , just like @entity161 , who turned @entity160 down last summer , he actively wanted to join @entity58			1
none of this is part of the ‘ our league is better than yours ’ argument			0
but it is significant that the incredible buying power of the @entity94 , television money , crowds and petrodollars combined , was n’t enough to secure any of the three best talents to move this summer — with @entity63 still pending			1
prodigious talent : @entity176 of @entity10 is @entity2 's young pass master in terms of the title it ’s a mini-league of three this term — and @entity58 start with major advantages			1
last season they lacked depth of quality and stamina at the killer moments of the title race , but that ’s been adequately addressed this summer with the market not yet closed			0
just as he was asked to do last season , manager @entity192 , @entity8 and @entity193 winner in his first season at the club , will be asked to forge some sort of equilibrium in his starting @entity198 despite the fact that @entity132 in midfield gives nowhere near the work rate , tackling and pressing of the deposed @entity202			0
when @entity192 faced similarly tough tactical questions a year ago due to incorporating @entity161 , it took him a beat or two but , when the tempo was sorted , with an adventurous 4 - 3 - 3 , they made sweet music			0
if @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity25 all find a prolonged spell of fitness , energy and synchronisation under a new , brutally demanding , manager , and if @entity216 can add some of the youth and athleticism which @entity219 now can not , then @entity24 look interesting			1
the reigning champions , fortified by @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 , retain the ‘ feel ’ of a team you ’d not like to meet down a dark alley on a saturday night			0
potential trophy winners again — but it ’s to @entity58 that all eyes will turn			2
six trophies lay in front of them and , after the @entity237 , it ’s one down			0
this squad is in shape to add the majority of the rest of them			2
intelligent and sharp : @entity245 coach @entity244			0

@entity10 , @entity58 and @entity24 have spent more than £ 300m
@entity25 , @entity248 and @entity109 actively wanted to move to @entity2
@entity10 could still add exceptional @entity63 to their tally
