she said : ' i spotted the resemblance after a friend of mine pointed it out one day			2
' i always thought he looked like @entity38 but then i realised he looked much more like @entity3			2
' i started matching up pictures of @entity3 and @entity5 and realised the similarity was uncanny			1
' when i searched lookalike agencies there was only a @entity11 , @entity9 and @entity44 lookalike but no @entity3 so i realised @entity5 must be the only one			1

mrs @entity30 said : ' @entity3 is known for the iconic @entity25 modelling and i thought the best photos of @entity5 would be of him posing similarly to that shoot			1
' finding the coat was just complete luck but i knew i had to get it as people would always want the iconic looks recreated			0
' as it is a high end brand i 'm hoping the coat lasts him a decent amount of time but i 'm sure he will grow out of it pretty quickly			0
' @entity5 's mother now hopes that he continues to grow up looking similar to @entity3 so that he can always keep his famous looks she had always thought the similarity was just a joke shared between family and friends but when strangers started noticing she realised that there was a chance for @entity5 to do something about it			1
this was when she had the idea to put him forward for a lookalike agency			0
' @entity5 thinks it 's a good bit of fun and i would make sure it would n't get in the way of school or his hobbies			1
' he plays football for our local team and thoroughly enjoys it			0
' his sister also plays football and the two of them get on really well , even if she does make fun of him for looking so much like @entity3			0
' he used to get really embarrassed about it but now he loves it and says he is a hit with the ladies			0
' @entity9 and mrs @entity30 were pregnant at the same time but little did she know that this would n't be where the similarities would end			0

@entity5 said : ' when my mum made a joke about it at first i did n't even know who he was			2
' my sister said i looked like @entity38 but i did n't like being compared to him too much			0
' when i realised who @entity3 was i was really happy as i love football and his dad is such an amazing football legend			0
