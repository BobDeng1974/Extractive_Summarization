from clumpy flat shoes that seem to shorten a woman ’s leg to voluminous cocoon coats that hide every curve of the body , there is seemingly no end to the trends which women love — but men loathe			1
indeed , styles that seem designed to put men off are so prevalent on the @entity12 this season that they ’ve even been dubbed ‘ man - repellers ’			1
here , @entity15 , who usually favours a more alluring style of dress , tries out some of these man - unfriendly must - haves and , predictably , loves the feeling of putting comfort before style			1
but what does her husband @entity22 have to say ? @entity15 with husband @entity22 who she tests the latest ' man - repelling ' high street fashions on surprisingly sexy — or an old boiler ? boiler suit , £ 14.99 , hm.com necklace , £ 29.99 , zara.com @entity30 , £ 69 , reiss.com shoes , £ 195 , lucychoilondon.com she says : i feel surprisingly sexy in this despite the slightly voluminous , low crotched look			1
it ’s so comfortable and brings back fond memories of a black all - in - one i used to wear for dancing back in the day			1
i know for a fact my husband will hate this look , but there is something fun and liberating dressing in something i know men wo n’t like			1
it makes me feel like i ’m in control — almost as if i ’m daring @entity22 not to want me			0
accessorize with a cheeky smile and you ’re good to go ! he says : i would trust this person to check my oil and change a tyre , but i ca n’t imagine taking her out for a spin			0
that low - slung crotch and saggy bum are n’t doing it for me			1
i think i can speak for most men when i say we do n’t much like this shapeless , masculine look			1
she looks like she ’s about to jump out of a plane at 30,000 ft ! @entity64 — @entity66 @entity65 ? knit top , £ 95 , and belt , £ 49 , reiss.com @entity70 skirt , £ 85 , grayandosbourn.co.uk shoes , £ 69.99 , and oversized cardigan , £ 59.99 , zara.com she says : a lovely chunky knit is always in fashion			1
i could easily imagine curling up on the couch on a winter night in this cardi , but it would also work on an autumnal evening out			0
it ’s cosy , comfy and sensual			1
a cardi like this is essentially — an invitation to snuggle up ! an utterly glorious addition to any winter wardrobe			0
he says : she looks like a flight attendant on an obscure @entity91 airline ! not my favourite look			0
@entity15 ’s right when she says it ’s chunky — her hips look twice their usual size and the bulk of the cardigan hides all of her curves			1
it looks like something my grandmother would wear			0
however , slip the frumpy cardi off and now you ’re talking ! @entity104 denim nightmare ? jeans , £ 85 , mih - @entity106 @entity107 , £ 30 , debenhams.com necklace , £ 22 , accessorize.com @entity110 heels , £ 89 , dunelondon.com she says : my jean collection consists of skinny and boot - cut			2
while these boyfriend jeans are n’t as figure hugging as my favourites , i love the way they make me feel more youthful			2
ten out of ten for comfort , too			0
i can imagine pulling them on on a sunday morning or dressing them up with heels			0
he says : i am not a fan			0
my wife has a cute bottom and her usual jeans show it off perfectly			0
why cover up such a gem ? i love the way i can see daylight between her thighs when she wears her skinny jeans , but these are more manly and hide all of her assets			1
it ’s a no from me			2
vintage romance — @entity141 ? floral midi - dress , £ 329 , hobbs.co.uk @entity30 , £ 49 , reiss.com @entity143 , £ 49.99 , zara.com she says : slipping into this gorgeous vintage dress took me back to the @entity146 , reminding me of a favourite floral dress			1
it makes me feel romantic and ready for afternoon tea at @entity150			0
what is it about vintage clothes that women love and men do n’t ? i also adore the length			1
it ’s reassuring to put my legs away ! he says : well , she must be in there somewhere			2
does this outfit come with a rocking chair ? i ’m not a fan of long dresses , especially in those shoes			2
my wife has a good set of pins so let ’s see a bit more of them ! is this supposed to be a hot look this winter ? it just looks old - fashioned to me			1
@entity177 flats — or passion killers ? @entity179 , £ 165 , russellandbromley.co.uk @entity181 top , £ 98 , @entity182 trousers , £ 14.99 , hm.com jacket , £ 89.99 , zara.com she says : these brogues make me feel trendy , youthful and definitely put a spring in my step			0
the comfort factor is off - the - scale wonderful			2
i feel ready for whatever the day throws at me and there is something undeniably sexy about wearing such manly shoes			2
the fact that they ’re so masculine and clumpy makes me feel incredibly feminine			0
i also love the little jacket , which adds a bit of attitude			2
these would work as well on a date night as they would for shopping with the girls			0
he says : at first glance , i thought she ’d stolen my work shoes			0
i am actually a big fan of flats and can never understand how or why my wife tortures herself in heels , but these brogues are just too masculine , inelegant and stompy			0
they have no place on a woman ’s foot			1
this outfit would look so much better with some knee - high boots .			0
