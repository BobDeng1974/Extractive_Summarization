nearly a million tickets were sold last month for the @entity1 and the phenomenal demand means @entity4 fans face disappointing news when ballot results are revealed on friday			1
despite high ticket prices , the hosts ’ pool a match against @entity10 at @entity11 drew 650,000 applications during the general sale period			1
given that only around a quarter of the stadium ’s 82,000 seats were available , approximately three per cent of applicants will be successful			0
public appetite to watch @entity4 means the encounter with @entity19 is also massively over-subscribed , as is the tournament final next october 31 , which attracted 500,000 applications			1
other games which generated greatest demand are holders @entity25 against @entity27 at @entity28 on the opening weekend , @entity10 v @entity19 and both semi-finals			1
there has been phenomenal demand for the @entity4 v @entity31 pool clash at @entity11 in total there were 650,000 ticket applications for @entity4 's pivotal clash against the @entity10 @entity4 's pool match against @entity19 has proved almost as popular with 500,000 applications the majority will be left disappointed but the volume of applications shows the passion for @entity4 in the @entity42 in all , 950,000 tickets have been allocated through the general sale , on top of the 340,000 which were sold through rugby clubs earlier this year			1
supporter tour packages are on course to break records and hospitality boxes have sold out at @entity11 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
@entity54 , chief executive of organisers @entity4 2015 , said : ‘ we are thrilled with demand a year out from the tournament and the record level of demand we saw in september is a terrific indicator of the general interest and excitement for @entity1 2015			1
demand has exceeded supply for a high number of matches and the only down - side is that there will inevitably be some disappointment			1
‘ anyone who missed out on tickets this time will get first priority when the remaining tickets go back on sale next month			2
’ @entity4 2015 chief executive @entity54 is delighted with the incredible demand for tickets of course , the task now will be to drive sales for the less - coveted matches			1
there are understood to be plenty of tickets left for many games at the @entity87 and for the fixtures in @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			2
but the bandwagon is well and truly rolling and that will take the pressure off organisers in terms of their financial obligations			0
this @entity1 will balance the books after the last tournament in @entity25 generated limited revenue			1
@entity4 won the hosting rights largely on the basis of their ability to generate substantial profit to meet the £ 80million guarantee payment to the @entity108 and end up with some change in the bank			2
that target is seemingly in hand			0
the strong sales represent a giant leap towards the overall goal of shifting 2.3million tickets through all channels worldwide			2
they demonstrate a heartening interest in the game in this country and provide another example of the @entity42 support for major sports events , as was the case at the @entity126 and the @entity127 this year			1
@entity25 lifted the trophy in 2011 , and as the right - hand graphic shows there are millions who want to see the 2015 tournament while those involved with marketing and sales drive must maintain the momentum , the next challenge is looming — one of a logistical variety			1
@entity4 face @entity140 next month at @entity11 in a test which kicks off at 7pm			2
it will be used as a practice run for the night games which will be taking place at @entity146 next year			2
experience suggests there will be gridlock on the roads and long queues to catch the last trains back into the capital or out to the south and west			0
yet there were fears that @entity158 would grind to a halt during the @entity160 and they proved unfounded			0
perhaps a few scare stories in the build - up and some strategic road closures on match - days might have the same liberating effect			0
@entity166 will belatedly arrive at @entity167 next week armed with yet another accolade			1
the 25 - year - old was in @entity170 on thursday to collect his award as the @entity173 ’s @entity172 , the first @entity174 to receive the prestigious prize			2
‘ it ’s unexpected really , ’ said the @entity176 , who is recovering from surgery after fracturing a cheekbone and eye socket during @entity181 ’ @entity183 triumph			0
‘ i was n’t supposed to be in the country			0
i was supposed to be out of here a couple of weeks ago			0
’ instead , @entity166 was on hand to present @entity4 shirts to four uncapped players ahead of their @entity192 clash with @entity140 on saturday			1
one of the newcomers , @entity195 ’s @entity194 , said : ‘ he ’s always been an awesome player			0
it was a bit emotional for him			0
he wishes he was out there playing with us			0
’ @entity167 and — eventually — @entity4 will hope he soon proves as inspirational in union			1
@entity166 poses after being awarded rugby league 's @entity203 on thursday @entity10 have provided a soap opera this year and there is every chance the drama will go on now @entity209 has been put in charge			1
he has a strong record with @entity212 and the @entity213 , but he is also highly volatile			0
in march , he was given a suspended six - month ban by @entity216 ’s governing body for abusing a cameraman in @entity218			0
the judicial officer noted : ‘ the propensity of mr @entity209 to behave in this manner is disturbing			2
’ he also broke a glass door at @entity223 this year , was warned about his conduct by @entity225 last year and was fined after his @entity227 side lost the 2011 @entity228			0
on that occasion , he told @entity231 coach @entity230 : ‘ get out of the * * * * ing way , you * * * * ing moron			0
’ @entity209 will have to behave at least until the end of next august , or his suspended ban would kick in just in time for the @entity1			1
@entity213 boss @entity209 has replaced @entity237 as @entity10 's head coach quote of the week — ‘ he ’s a mercenary , there ’s no question about that , but he ’s a terribly gifted sportsman			1
while we might not all agree with the @entity247 letting him come and go as he pleases , i guess that ’s the reality of professional sport			0
’ former @entity25 coach @entity249 on @entity250 ’ test recall , just weeks after returning from another stint in league			1
former @entity25 coach @entity249 has had his say on @entity250 ’ ( centre ) test recall last word — wasps wing @entity258 scored a sensational solo try against @entity212 last week with a burst of pace and fancy footwork that even brought @entity265 fans to their feet in raucous tribute			1
it was the sort of ‘ x-factor ’ moment @entity4 want to see performed on their behalf , but his lack of bulk continues to count against him			2
after naming an elite squad without @entity258 in it , @entity275 said : ‘ we talk about @entity250 coming back into @entity25 ’s back line , alongside @entity280 and @entity281			1
it ’s not to say you ca n’t have @entity258			2
' you can , but have to have the balance right			0
’ in other words , his chance will come only if @entity4 deploy sufficiently imposing figures throughout the rest of their back line			2
size matters more than ever			0
nimble artistry is being blasted out of the @entity295 equation			0
it is a real shame			0
@entity258 's omission from the @entity4 squad shows that artistry is being ignored in test rugby			1

there has been phenomenal demand for tickets for next year 's @entity1 and the ballot results will be revealed on friday
@entity4 's matches against @entity10 and @entity19 have been particularly over-subscribed
the level of interest shows the great appetite for rugby in the @entity42
@entity166 will make his long - awaited arrival at @entity167 next week
@entity10 appointing @entity209 as head coach is a massive risk
it 's disappointing that @entity258 is considered too *lightweight* to make @entity4 squad for *autumn* *internationals*
former @entity25 coach @entity249 says @entity250 is ' a mercenary ' but ' a terribly gifted sportsman '
