trial : @entity1 goes on trial today in @entity3 after pleading not guilty to accusations of a conspiracy to bomb the @entity3 subway details of the oath of allegiance taken by new @entity11 recruits were laid bare yesterday			1
they pledged to obey @entity13 ‘ for the establishment of the religion of @entity17 ’ and help the terror chief wage jihad			2
the pledge emerged at the trial of an @entity11 suspect accused of plotting to blow up a @entity22 shopping centre			1
it was among a haul of intelligence seized by @entity27 commandos during the mission to kill @entity13 in his @entity30 compound			0
it is the first time any of this valuable information has been used in a prosecution			0
the oath , submitted in evidence to the @entity3 trial of former @entity22 student @entity1 , reads : ‘ i accept your allegiance on behalf of @entity40 , to listen and obey , in hardship and ease , and to follow whomever sheikh @entity40 assigns to be my amir on the jihad for the sake of @entity17 , for the establishment of the religion of @entity17 , and to memorise the secrets of the group and to be where i am ordered to			1
’ prosecutors said yesterday that @entity1 , 28 , led the @entity22 cell of a three - pronged @entity11 plot in 2009 to ‘ repeat the devastation of 9/11 ’			1
as well as blowing up the @entity54 , the terror group planned to set off bombs in the @entity3 subway and at the offices of a @entity59 newspaper that had published cartoons of the @entity61 , the court heard			0
the trial was told @entity1 , who was extradited to the @entity63 two years ago , was sent to the @entity64 from @entity30 in 2008 with co-conspirators to ‘ become westerners ’ , manufacture explosives and plant them at a target that would ‘ bomb hundreds of innocent people and cause millions of dollars of damage ’			1
although he is not accused of being involved in the @entity3 attack plan , @entity63 prosecutors say the three plots ‘ were all connected and all part of one @entity11 conspiracy ’			0
jurors would be shown a letter from @entity11 ’s head of western operations that proved the @entity22 plot ‘ went all the way to the top of @entity11 – to none other than @entity13 ’ , said prosecutor @entity84			1
‘ you will see the chilling reminder in that letter to @entity13 that @entity11 ’s goal was to attack the infidel in their home territory ’ , she said			2
' pledge of allegiance ' : prosecutors say the trial will feature evidence seized during the @entity27 raid in 2011 that killed @entity13 , pictured , including an oath @entity1 presumably took on joining @entity11 evidence : eight more documents from @entity13 's compound in @entity100 are to be revealed			1
in this file picture @entity30 policemen stand guard as workers demolish the house where the @entity11 chief died the text of the @entity11 ' pledge of allegiance ' , which has been translated by prosecutors			0
we , of course , take the pledge of allegiance on behalf of sheikh @entity13			0
we say in the wording something like : i accept your allegiance on behalf of @entity118 , to listen and obey , in hardship and ease , and to follow whomsoever @entity118 assigns to be my @entity120 on the jihad for the sake of @entity17 , for the establishment of the religion of @entity17 , and the rule of @entity126 that governs the law of @entity17 , and to memorise the secrets of the group , and to be where i am ordered to			0
( source : @entity131 ) @entity1 has denied charges of providing material support to terrorists and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction			0
he faces life imprisonment if convicted			0
the jury is set to hear evidence next week from six undercover @entity141 agents who are being allowed to testify disguised by wigs and make - up in order to conceal their identities			1
the trial is also unusual as @entity1 has decided to represent himself in court			2
wearing an open - necked yellow shirt and bushy beard , @entity1 read out his opening statement and later tried repeatedly , but unsuccessfully , to challenge the testimony of a confessed @entity11 member , @entity152 , who is giving evidence against him			2
the court heard @entity1 followed the terror training he received in @entity30 , communicating with his @entity11 handler by using the email names of women			2
he also used code , using women ’s names for the types of explosive he was considering and referring to the actual bomb attack as a ‘ marriage ’ or ‘ wedding ’ , said prosecutors			0
in court : @entity1 , second from left , is pictured in a january 7 court sketch as he is arraigned in @entity170			0
he pleaded not guilty through his attorney @entity171 , centre the @entity173 : two government witnesses expected to testify against @entity175 and @entity176 - have already pleaded guilty to a plot to bomb the transport network when he told his @entity11 contact he was sorry he would ‘ miss the party ’ , @entity1 was referring to the hopefully devastating @entity54 explosion , the court heard			1
however , @entity1 insisted he had been in the @entity64 simply to look for a @entity184 bride			1

@entity1 pleaded not guilty to an alleged plot to bomb subway trains
he is also accused of plotting to bomb the @entity190 in @entity22
