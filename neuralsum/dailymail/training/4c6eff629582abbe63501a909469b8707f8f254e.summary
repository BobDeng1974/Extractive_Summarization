@entity0 faces his first real test at home since becoming @entity4 coach this weekend when the @entity5 host second - placed @entity6 this saturday			1
the @entity7 has so far won all three of his games at home , but his side 's form has been quite the opposite away from the @entity13 with three defeats out of three			1
as a result , the @entity17 club remain three points behind the top six and five off the top four and a place in the @entity24 next season , while they trail @entity6 by nine points			2
@entity0 has won all three of his home games since taking over as manager of @entity4 @entity0 led @entity28 to their first ever @entity24 victory when he was interim manager in 2012 @entity0 celebrates with his @entity28 players as they won the 2012 fa cup final against @entity32 ' i do n't know if there 's a favourite for this game , but for sure we 're the home team and we 've got to take the initiative , ' said @entity0 , who insists he is ' totally focused ' on saturday 's game and not the reunion with former club @entity28 in the @entity24 next week			1
' @entity41 has an amazing atmosphere and i 'm positively surprised by practically everything , although i would have preferred a few more points			0
' defeat would leave @entity4 in no better state than they were when @entity0 took charge , although he appealed back then for patience			2
he has renewed that appeal , saying he needs time to get the side playing how he wants them to be and he can only see himself getting that time during the winter break			0
' hopefully then we will have most of our long - term injured players back , ' he added			0
by then , the state of the affairs in the @entity57 will be a lot clearer too with the sight of @entity4 and @entity60 in the bottom half of the table something of an anomaly			1
@entity64 ( right ) and @entity65 ( left ) have seen @entity66 lead the @entity57 by seven points @entity69 's @entity60 side have had a tough start to the season and need to beat @entity72 @entity60 will be keen to build on their win over @entity74 last time out when they head to @entity72 this weekend , otherwise they may once again drop into the bottom three			1
@entity74 , meanwhile , will be desperate to bounce back from that , their very first defeat of the season in all competitions , when they play host to @entity81 's @entity80			0
a seven - point deficit has already grown on league leaders @entity66 , who host faltering @entity85 , while the gap to sixth - placed @entity87 has been cut to just three points with @entity90 's men in action at @entity92 this saturday			0
the focus shifts to the bottom of the table on sunday when @entity97 and @entity98 meet in a northern @entity100 derby with both sides currently residing inside the bottom three before bottom - placed @entity104 host @entity102			0
elsewhere , with the carnival season now under way , @entity100 's two @entity106 strongholds @entity107 and @entity108 both have home games against @entity112 and @entity113 respectively .			2

@entity4 play @entity6 and a win would move them *nearer* to the top six
@entity118 's side have won all three games under him at home
elsewhere , @entity60 travel to @entity72 in need of another win
