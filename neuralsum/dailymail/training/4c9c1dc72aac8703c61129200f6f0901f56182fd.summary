it also emerged that new car sales surged by 12.7 per cent in july compared to a year ago , with a total of 162,228 registrations			1
and the @entity19 said the economy grew by 0.7 per cent between may and july as the recovery picked up pace – double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first three months of the year			2
house prices rising by almost £ 10,000 in a year were just one part of a wider economic recovery , say experts the raft of data led to renewed optimism from economic analysts			2
‘ wow , ’ said @entity31 , chief economist at investment bank @entity32			2
‘ there is n’t really another way of describing the data coming out of the @entity5 at the minute			2
’ and @entity37 , chief @entity5 economist at @entity38 , said it was ‘ another very good news day for the @entity5 economy ’			1
he added : ‘ it is striking that the improved news on the @entity5 economy is coming across a wide range of sectors , which lifts hopes that the recovery is broadening as well as deepening			1
’ sales of new cars from @entity5 ’s resurgent motor manufacturers have now risen for 17 months in a row , with @entity52 ’s @entity51 proving the most popular			1
and official figures showed total factory output jumped 1.9 per cent in june with all 13 sectors of @entity5 manufacturing – including food and drink , computers and aircraft – expanding in a single month for the first time since june 1992			1
@entity63 's house price graph index graph shows how prices are rising by above four per cent over last summer ( quarterly annual % change along the top ; quarterly year on year price change on the left ) recent rise : house prices have risen for six months in a row but average house prices to earnings are also on the rise the latest figures reveal that house prices are 4.6 per cent higher than a year ago – and are rising at their highest rate for three years , according to the @entity63			1

@entity5 manufacturing rose two per cent motoring along : new car sales surged by 12.7 per cent in july compared to a year ago , with a total of 162,228 registrations many analysts also fear the increase is not justified in terms of what buyers can afford and the state of household finances			1
first - time buyers , for example , will need to take on bigger mortgages if they are to get onto the property ladder			0
@entity112 prices now stand at 4.62 times average earnings , which is up from the 4.34 times in 2009 when the market hit a trough following the banking crisis			1
industry experts say two government schemes , @entity120 and help to buy , which have cut interest rates and allow people to buy with small deposits , are largely responsible for the increases			0
@entity126 , @entity63 ’s housing economist , said : ‘ @entity112 prices are expected to continue to rise gradually through this year , with only modest economic growth and still falling real earnings constraining housing demand and activity			1
’ property economist @entity131 , of @entity132 , argued that house prices are overvalued			2
‘ evidence that house prices are in the midst of a steady recovery continues to accumulate , which is bad news for first - time buyers , ’ he said			1
‘ that said , it is unlikely that house prices will continue to show such strong gains			0
poor fundamentals will help keep a lid on demand , as will the fact that the market is still overvalued			0
wider recovery : economists said the better than expected growth in manufacturing and industrial output in june pointed to a broad based recovery in the economy ‘ there are also some signs that the supply of housing is now picking up , which should take some of the heat out of price gains			0
’ a report from property website @entity162 earlier this week found that six in ten people who rent their home feel ‘ trapped ’ because they can not afford to buy			0
@entity166 , chief executive of mortgage broker @entity167 , said : ‘ this will be a long , slow recovery			0
much ground has been lost and transactions and lending levels are running at a fraction of what they were at the height of the housing boom			0
’ @entity178 , director of online estate agent @entity179 , said : ‘ in many areas , prices are still way off their peak , although @entity86 remains the star performer with gravity - defying price rises thanks to the influx of foreign buyers			0
' surprisingly , we are seeing strong activity during the summer , which historically tend to be quieter			0
this momentum needs to be carried through into september and october if the property market is to continue on the long road to recovery			0
