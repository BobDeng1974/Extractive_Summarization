by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 01:51 est , 6 july 2012 not much leaves brash hotel inspector presenter @entity2 speechless			1
but in the first episode of her new series , the frizzy haired hotelier gets more than she bargained			2
as part of her crusade to make over the nation ’s hotels , perfectionist @entity2 ’s first stop is suburban @entity13 where she is set to help ex farmer @entity14 discover why his elite nudist resort is less than swinging			1
56 - year - old @entity14 hoped to turn his love of being naked in to a business and sunk his life savings – over £ 1million - in to developing the detached seven - bedroom house in to @entity20 , a fully nude hotel			1
blushes : undressing to impress at the retreat @entity14 says : ‘ for me naturism is a natural thing			2
to feel the sun on your skin and the breeze on your body is a lovely feeling			2
' but 15 months on bookings are at an all - time low , and @entity2 thinks she knows why			0
all are welcome as long as they abide by the fully naked rules at all times and unusually for a nudist resort @entity14 ’s ' let it all hang out ' policy is strictly enforced in all areas , including the kitchen , dining room and spa			1
steamy : @entity2 enjoys the facilities at the @entity20 giggles : a guest relaxes in the communal areas while @entity2 enjoys the view arriving at the hotel a nervous looking @entity2 asks “ do i have to get undressed straight away ? ’ she resists for a while , content to just enjoy the view , but soon the game hotelier attempts to join in by going for an au naturel dip in the @entity56 and enjoying some of the hotel ’s spa services			1
but – of course - @entity14 and @entity2 soon clash with her insisting that @entity14 ’s strict and uncompromising no - clothes dress code is putting off more people than it attracts			0
hopeful : @entity14 scrubs the spa ready for new guests aside from the nakedness @entity2 is also less than impressed with the catering ( ready prepared microwaved meals to avoid injury ) garden and the décor of the £ 80 rooms , labelling the hotel ‘ sterile ’ and ‘ anodyne ’			1
as well as offering style and menu advice the expert wants guests to be able to wear clothes at most times with some naked - only areas			0
a hot tub showdown later and @entity14 's stubborn streak is eventually worn down , leading to a raft of happy new clothes - free groups falling in love with @entity85			0
' @entity2 has relit the fire and focused my attention on what 's really important			0
' roll on the summer			0

fiery @entity92 heads to a failing naturist resort in @entity13 to try and improve the bottom line
the hotel inspector is on at *9pm* *tonight* on @entity97
