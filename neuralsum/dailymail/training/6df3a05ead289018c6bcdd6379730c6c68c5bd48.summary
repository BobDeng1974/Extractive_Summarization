by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 03:41 est , 30 october 2012 concern is growing over a ' creepy ' new @entity3 app which scours pictures posted by users ' @entity6 friends to pull out all the photos showing them wearing revealing outfits			1
on sale on the @entity13 for £ 1.49 ( $ 1.99 ) , the @entity11 ! app uses some sort of image - recognition technology to work out which of your friends pictures show the most skin			1
once the pictures have been discovered , users can then browse them all before bookmarking their favourites and sharing them with others			2
' find your friend 's sexy pics instantly ' : a screengrab of the @entity11 ! app 's homepage the service is particular disturbing in light of recent claims by the @entity32 that it had found more than 12,000 instances of girls who had posted seductive pictures of themselves that had ended up on pornographic sites			1
only weeks ago , @entity38 was unmasked by @entity39			2
he had posed many pictures harvested from @entity6 onto forums entitled ‘ @entity43 ’ and ‘ @entity44 ’ , sparking outrage on the internet			2
on the website , he was also one of the driving forces behind the sickening ' @entity50 ' forum , where users submitted sexualised images of scantily - clad underage girls - many of which also originated from @entity6			1
the users deleted photos of girls older than 16			2
that forum was also taken down after a backlash by users			2
the @entity11 ! app has the potential to allow paedophiles to accelerate the process of looking for pictures of under - dressed youngsters , a spokesman for the @entity63 and @entity62 warned			1
' there will always be a new technology or device or platform that can potentially be exploited , ' the spokesman said			0
' for @entity74 that means two things , educating young people about staying safe online , including not posting inappropriate images which can send out the wrong message ; and staying on top of the different technologies that offenders can use to network with other paedophiles or to contact children directly			1
' @entity3 app : badabing ! trawls galleries posted by users ' @entity6 friends , highlighting all the pictures showing people in revealing outfits and allowing users to bookmark and share their favourites civil liberties campaign group @entity94 said it provided a ' stark warning ' about how users of @entity6 and other social networks can lose control over data once it is uploaded to the internet			1
' privacy is clearly at the very back of the designers mind when creating an application that enables this kind of search to be easier when it , in fact , it should be made more difficult , ' said @entity109 , the group 's deputy director			0
' all too often there appears to be the attitude online that services can ignore directives on the " minimum collection of data " and " privacy by design " which should no longer be tolerated by internet users or the data protection regulators			0
a shocking page called ‘ @entity50 ’ has been removed from @entity6 after it caused outrage among users of the social network			0
the site pictured many graphic pictures of seemingly under - aged young women in various states of dress			1
some are bending over suggestively			0
one person wrote on the page ’s wall that the site was ‘ wrong on so many levels , ’ and begged other like - minded users to report the site			1
it is unclear who created the page			0
a representative for @entity6 told @entity142 that the page had been removed although he would not comment on individual cases			0
' such practices are quite simple intrusive and unnecessary and , as such , consumers need protection from contracts that are either too intrusive or too unclear to understand			0
' so far available only for the @entity3 , its creators also plan a web - based app which would allow users to login via a website to search their @entity6 contacts ' picture albums			1
a reporter for @entity157 downloaded the app and tested it out on his @entity6 profile			1
' it actually kind of works and it 's really creepy , ' @entity160 reported			0
the @entity11 ! homepage boasts that the service can help users to ' find your friend 's ( sic ) sexy pics instantly			0
' it includes testimonials from friends of the app 's creator , @entity172			1
mr @entity172 's roommate , @entity174 , said : ' this is going to save me so much time diggin ' through pics			0
' however , the app developers admitted they were struggling to cope with demand , and some users complained they were unable to connect			1
' it is the sheer traffic , and image processing is very resource consuming , ' said mr @entity172			1
' we are working on it and trying to get it back up as soon as possible , we had requests for millions of images within hours and our db could n't handle it			2
' those commenting on the @entity157 report on the app were less enthusiastic about the service			2
@entity197 wrote : ' creating apps like this is just plain wrong			0
' if people put these pictures online then it is their choice ... but it is just very weird			0
' @entity205 said : ' even without @entity11 ( bad app ) i 'm sure some pretty creepy people get online & cruise around hunting for just exactly what this app is now doing for him , and making it far too easy			2
' evidently all the porn that is flying all over on the web is n't enough to keep them happy			0
' @entity142 put some of the concerns raised to mr @entity172			0
he said : ' we are the only social image recognition app and " beach and pool pics " is our first search option , which we knew would be popular			1
' people have thousands of pictures on a myriad of social networking sites , the purpose of @entity11 ! is to help friends find specific type of content quickly			0
