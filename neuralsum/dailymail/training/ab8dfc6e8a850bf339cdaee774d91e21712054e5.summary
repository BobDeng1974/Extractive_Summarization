facelifts can be the object of derision - with many people seeing them as vanity , even if they do have the desired rejuvenating effect			1
but for @entity8 , the operation represented the closing chapter in her battle with skin cancer which ate away part of her cheek and half of her nose			1
the 67 - year - old feels transformed after state - of - the - art surgery took years off her appearance			1
not only has her jawline been tightened but her face , which was left lopsided despite reconstructive surgery , has been evened up , with fat suctioned from her tummy , then injected into her cheeks			1
@entity27 , 67 , feels transformed after state - of - the - art surgery took years off her appearance recalling the terrifying hours before surgeons first operated to remove the cancer , @entity8 says : ' they said they did n't know whether they would have to remove half or all of my nose			1
' i 'm not proud of my looks but i challenge anyone to be told this and not feel desperately worried			0
i know i was one of the lucky ones - when i woke up from the operation , at least i was alive			2
you draw your reserves from that			0
in the end , i felt huge relief that they had n't taken my whole nose			0
' @entity8 was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma ( @entity49 ) , a slow - growing form of skin cancer , in her right nostril after her dentist expressed concern about blistering inside her nose			1
what @entity8 had thought was a small , painless blackhead - which had been there for six or seven years - started to bubble up and blister			2
her gp referred her to a private consultant , who immediately recognised it as a sign of cancer			2
like most skin cancers , bccs are triggered by sun exposure , and @entity8 believes she and her 73 - year - old husband @entity69 's hobby of travelling the world in open - top cars may have been to blame			1
the couple , who now live on the @entity74 , retired in 1997 after selling their business , a firm that designed and manufactured food - processing equipment			2
bccs do n't respond to chemotherapy , so radiotherapy or surgery are the only treatment options after a six - hour operation to remove the cancer at @entity86 in @entity87 , surgeons discovered the carcinoma had burrowed upwards through the muscle and fat in her cheek , beside her nose , and the main root was found dangerously close to the outside corner of her right eye			1
bccs do n't respond to chemotherapy , so radiotherapy or surgery are the only treatment options			2
' a round hole more than 1in in diameter on my cheek was taken away , ' says @entity8			0
' they stretched skin from my cheek over to close it up			2
the lower portion of my right nostril was removed and i had further work carried out the following year to improve this			0
' she was initially pleased with the cosmetic result			0
but the right side of her face had a tighter appearance than the left , and she lost the normal groove down the right - hand side of her nose			1
as time went on , her face began to appear more and more uneven			2
' i hated having my photo taken and even avoided looking in the mirror as much as possible , ' @entity8 adds			0
last year she sought help from @entity125 , who works at the @entity126 of the @entity127 in @entity128 on the @entity74			0
he says : ' @entity8 had been left with a significant deformity			2
she asked me to improve the symmetry of her face , but we can do better than that			2
' mr @entity125 began by releasing the scar tissue from @entity8 's original operation to make it less tight and carried out the lower facelift , making several incisions starting in the hairline above her ear and going down around her ear			0
then about 150ml of fat was suctioned from @entity8 's abdomen , and centrifuged to remove blood and oil			0
the remaining 50ml of fat was injected into her cheeks			0
mr @entity125 says : ' traditional facelift surgery tightens and pulls up but does n't restore volume lost in the face			1
fat filling creates a fuller , younger - looking face			1
' @entity8 says : ' i looked like a @entity157 when i first came round , but @entity125 had warned me that this would be the case			0
' they put in twice as much fat as you really need because your body absorbs a lot of it , so i was very puffy and bruised			0
' demand for cosmetic procedures has increased but for cancer patients , survival is the priority three weeks later , her face had settled down and @entity8 was delighted			1
' it 's a massive turnaround from thinking i would always be unhappy with my appearance to feeling like i look the best i ever have , ' she says			0
' my husband is just happy that i 'm happy			0
' because of the extra time , equipment and expertise involved , @entity8 's procedure costs about 25 per cent extra on top of the price of a normal facelift , and patients can expect to pay about Â£ 7,000 or more for the surgery			1
the latest figures from the @entity187 showed that demand for cosmetic procedures , including facelifts and fat - filling like @entity8 's , increased by more than ten per cent in the past year			1
but for patients in the immediate aftermath of a cancer diagnosis , survival is the priority			0
' we 'd never carry out this sort of facelift surgery at the same time as removing a cancer as we would n't want to compromise the cancer treatment , ' says mr @entity125 , who also carries out facial reconstruction for skin cancer patients on the @entity203			1
' with skin cancer it 's obviously important to cut it out completely and leave a safety zone around it to make sure it does n't come back			1
' with someone 's back or tummy you have loads of slack , but if what you 're cutting out is on someone 's face , you 're going to leave a big hole			0
' the most important thing is to treat the skin cancer properly			1
but it 's important that patients know it is n't simply a choice between survival and being left disfigured			0
