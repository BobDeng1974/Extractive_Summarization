police are to reopen 68 rape investigations where officers dismissed allegations that should have been pursued , it emerged yesterday			1
a review by @entity1 found that 54 allegations of rape were not investigated properly , possibly allowing sexual abusers to go unpunished			2
and @entity9 is reopening 14 rape investigations after an audit by @entity12 ( @entity12 ) revealed similar problems with the way its officers had dealt with allegations			1
the officers have been told they could face disciplinary action			2
rape charities said it was extremely worrying that so many cases had been handled incorrectly			1
the reinvestigations by @entity21 and @entity9 highlight growing concern that the problem may be widespread			1
earlier this year @entity12 criticised @entity34 for its ‘ unacceptable ’ handling of serious sexual crimes			0
in 2010 a rapist @entity21 policeman who attacked up to 30 women during a five - year reign of terror was jailed			0
@entity41 @entity40 , 44 , assaulted drug addicts in the cells and interview rooms of a city - centre police station , knowing that if they complained they were unlikely to be believed			2
one of them , a 19 - year - old drug addict when he first struck , estimated she had been abused 100 times as he kept track of her using the police computer			2
yet his colleagues ignored a series of warnings about his behaviour – some of them from his own wife			0
they were unaware that he had already stood trial for sex offences before he was recruited to the force			0
he was eventually sacked in 2007 for having ‘ consensual ’ sex with one of his victims , only to be reinstated on appeal eight months later			0
and when he was finally stopped , a senior detective with @entity1 offered him ‘ a get out of jail free card ’ if he agreed to resign			0
he refused , opting to take his chances in court			0
@entity40 – a tall , muscular former soldier – was found guilty of two rapes , three indecent assaults and six charges of misconduct in a public office , involving a total of seven women			0
he was cleared of three further rape charges , two indecent assaults and counts of misconduct involving another nine women			2
but police suspect he attacked at least a further 14			1
the watchdog found officers were put under pressure not to record rapes as crimes and police had spent a great deal of time trying to disprove the word of alleged victims			1
it has also recently been revealed that nearly a quarter of rape allegations made to police in parts of @entity97 were never recorded as crimes in 2013			1
an @entity12 audit into the @entity21 force earlier this year found it may have incorrectly deemed 11 rape cases to be ‘ no crime ’ , meaning that officers decided no law had been broken			1
after the audit the chief constable ordered a review of 153 allegations dating back to october 2011			0
yesterday the force said it is to reinvestigate 54 of those cases			2
a 50 - year - old man from @entity111 has already been arrested and subsequently bailed in connection to an allegation that was previously downplayed by investigating officers			0
chief superintendent @entity115 said the force had moved 48 officers from its rape investigations team to other units while the review was under way			1
the officers were served with gross misconduct notices , which could result in disciplinary action following the investigation			0
potential victims who were initially told that rape had not been committed will now be contacted by officers , which police admitted could be stressful			1
@entity130 , of @entity131 and @entity132 , said : ‘ it is extremely worrying that victims have reported rapes and on investigation it is being stated that there has been no crime			0
‘ only 10 per cent of rape victims that we help report to the police			1
but for these victims who have stepped forward , it is very disappointing and worrying for them to see that these cases have not been investigated properly			0
’ @entity21 ’s police and crime commissioner , @entity147 , described her ‘ grave concerns ’ when the @entity12 report , which has yet to be made publicly available , flagged up the 11 suspect cases			1
she said the report showed police did not take seriously cases where a female complainant had consumed a lot of alcohol , or those arising in a domestic setting			1
yesterday she said : ‘ we took immediate action when the hmic and , indeed , my office identified some rape ‘ ‘ no crimes ’ ’ of serious concern			0

@entity166 police admit 1 in 3 rape cases may have been written off
@entity9 is also reopening 14 rape investigations
48 officers have been warned they will be disciplined if they ' failed ' in job
