published : 11:29 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 28 march 2013 it 's hardly the usual sort of family heirloom handed down to generations			0
but this hot cross bun that was baked in 1821 is a cherished treasure that has been passed down through five generations			1
the @entity8 treat was baked on @entity9 in 1821 and still has a cross on the top			1
the fruity bun , which has even retained its smell , was made by @entity15 's great , great , great grandfather , @entity14 , who owned a bakery in @entity17 @entity15 said : ' it 's a relic which has been passed down through our family and we get it out every good friday ' @entity21 cradles the 192 - year - old bun - which shows no trace of mould @entity21 , 94 , keeps the 192 - year - old bun in a box and , although undoubtedly past its sell - by - date , still shows no traces of mould			1
the fruity bun , which has even retained its smell , was made by @entity15 's great , great , great grandfather , @entity14 , who owned a bakery in @entity17			1
it was made in the same year as @entity34 died , @entity32 was crowned king , poet @entity31 passed away and @entity36 painted his famous @entity38 picture			1
' it 's a relic which has been passed down through our family and we get it out every @entity9 , ' said @entity15			0
' it is rock hard like a fossil and the currants have disintegrated , but it still smells and looks like a hot cross bun , with the cross on the top			1
' @entity15 was given the bun , which has the date march 1821 on the base , by her mother			1
now she plans to hand it down to her own daughter , @entity54 and her 10 - year - old granddaughter , @entity55			1
' my mum said our ancestors worked in a baker 's shop and they believed buns baked on @entity9 did n't go mouldy , which this has proved , ' added @entity15 , from @entity65 , @entity66			0
' i think it was kept as it was made on @entity9 , which was a very special day			2
it has been preserved in a box for nearly 200 years now			0
the practice of eating special small cakes during @entity72 dates back at least to the ancient @entity73			0
the @entity75 custom of eating spiced buns on @entity9 was perhaps institutionalized in @entity77 , when a @entity17 bylaw was introduced forbidding the sale of such buns except on @entity9 , at @entity81 , and at burials			0
@entity75 folklore suggests that sharing a hot cross bun would ensure friendship throughout the coming year			1
if taken on a voyage hot cross buns are said to protect against shipwreck			2
if hung in a kitchen they are thought to protect against fires and ensure that all breads turn out perfectly			0
' it 's a rather unusual family heirloom , but i 'm proud of it and we still get the bun out of its box every @entity8			2
' hot cross buns with their combination of sweet , spicy and fruity flavours first became popular in @entity77 and have long been an @entity8 tradition , with the pastry cross symbolising the crucifixion			1
in the 19th century many people believed that hot cross buns baked on @entity9 would not go mouldy and had special healing powers			2
they thought the buns could be used as a cure for medical complaints such as indigestion			0
some people even grated fossilized remains of the @entity8 snack on wounds to help them heal or mixed it with water to make medicine			0
the preserved bun has astonished bakers , who ca n't believe it has survived so long			2
fresh hot cross buns usually only last for a few days before they start to go off			2
@entity123 , owner of @entity124 , near @entity125 , @entity66 , said : ' it 's quite amazing that it has survived for so long and extremely unusual			0
' i 've been told that you can varnish buns to keep the air out and stop them going mouldy , but i have n't heard of bakery products surviving without that			0
