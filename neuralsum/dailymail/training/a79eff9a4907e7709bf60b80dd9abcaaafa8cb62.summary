@entity0 's drubbing during the 1987 @entity41 nomination hearings made him a hero to the right and a rallying cry for younger conservatives			1

' @entity0 was a giant , a brilliant and fearless legal scholar , and a gentleman whose incredible wit and erudition made him a wonderful @entity59 colleague , ' said @entity60 , head of the @entity62 think - tank @entity61 where @entity0 was a distinguished fellow			0
known before his @entity6 nomination as one of the foremost national experts on antitrust law , @entity0 became much more widely known as a conservative cultural critic in the years that followed			1
with president @entity69 in 1987 : @entity0 's failed @entity6 nomination amassed the largest ever negative vote his 1996 book , ' slouching towards toward @entity73 : @entity74 and @entity76 decline , ' was an acid indictment of what @entity0 viewed as the crumbling ethics of modern society and the morally bankrupt politics of the left			1
' opportunities for teen - agers to engage in sex are ... more frequent than previously ; much of it takes place in homes that are now empty because the mothers are working , ' @entity0 wrote then			0
' the modern liberal devotion to sex education is an ideological commitment rather than a policy of prudence			0
' @entity0 , known until his death as ' @entity95 , ' served a relatively short tenure on the bench			2

it was the largest negative vote ever recorded for a @entity6 nominee			1
@entity69 and @entity0 's @entity41 backers called him eminently qualified - a brilliant judge who had managed to write nearly a quarter of his court 's majority rulings in just five years on the bench , without once being overturned by the @entity6			2
sen. @entity142 , @entity143 , summed up the opposition by saying , ' in @entity0 's @entity76 there is no room at the inn for blacks and no place in the @entity150 for women			2
' critics also called @entity0 a free - speech censor and a danger to the principle of separation of church and state			0
@entity0 's opponents used his prolific writings against him , and some called him a hypocrite when he seemed to waffle on previous strongly worded positions			2
@entity0 was accused of being a partisan hatchet man for @entity5 when , as the third - ranking official at the @entity31 he fired @entity2 special prosecutor @entity32 in the @entity33 of 1973 despite a reputation for personal charm , @entity0 did not play well on television			1
he answered questions in a seemingly bloodless , academic style and he cut a severe figure , with hooded eyes and heavy , rustic beard			0
stoic and stubborn throughout , @entity0 refused to withdraw when his defeat seemed assured			0
the fight has defined every high - profile judicial nomination since , and largely established the opposing roles of vocal and well - funded interest groups in @entity41 nomination fights			0
@entity0 would say later that the ferocity of the fight took him and the @entity180 by surprise , and he rebuked the administration for not doing more to salvage his nomination			0
the process begat a verb , ' to bork , ' meaning vilification of a nominee on ideological grounds			1

even friends did not entirely believe that			0
