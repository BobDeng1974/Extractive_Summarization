just days before she is due to wear a big white dress , @entity2 has been making black her colour of choice			1
the bride - to - be was spotted cheering on her fiancé @entity6 yesterday as he battled @entity7 in the men 's final at the @entity10 , in an outfit almost identical to two others she wore during the tournament			2
the 27 - year - old wore a short black silk dress with a zip front and a large straw hat to keep her glowing complexion intact for her wedding on april 11			1
@entity2 accompanied her sophisticated dress with a sombre expression as she witnessed @entity7 beat @entity6 again , taking home his fifth @entity10 title in @entity25 , making her black outfit a fitting choice			1
however this was not the first time @entity2 had opted for the dark colour while topping up her wedding tan			2
on april 3 @entity2 watched @entity6 , 27 , beat @entity42 of the @entity43 in their semi-final match in a high necked black mini dress accompanied with her trusty @entity48 glasses and straw hat			1
and on 31 march @entity2 showcased her golden glow and a glowing smile in an @entity54 off - the - shoulder dress as she witnessed @entity6 play against @entity56 @entity55 in their fourth round match			2
despite yesterday 's defeat @entity6 and @entity2 are sure to have their smiles back soon as the will tie the knot at @entity63 on april 11 and not , as anticipated , in the tiny chapel at his @entity65 , near the @entity67 town where he grew up			1
the 27 - year - old opted for a black mini dress for the third time during the @entity23 of the @entity10 @entity2 chose a zip front dress costing £ 110 from one of her high street favourites @entity30 on april 5 for the 27 - year - old ’s many fans and friends in the town , it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport , played out on the streets of the community			1
it is understood local residents and businesses urged the former @entity88 champion to hold the april 11 service at the cathedral rather than at @entity65 in nearby @entity91 – so they too could toast his big day			0
the 300 - seat , 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at @entity65 , which seats only 28			0
thousands are expected to line @entity95 on the day			0
@entity6 ’s uncle @entity96 said : ‘ i ’m sure it will be a popular decision , as he ’s had so much support from the people of @entity63 in the past			2
hopefully @entity2 will cheer up soon as she is due to marry @entity6 next week on april 11 @entity6 was defeated by long - term rival @entity7 who took home his fifth @entity10 title ‘ @entity6 is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to @entity63			1
i ’m sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day			0
’ the cathedral ’s minister , the @entity109 , said : ‘ i ca n’t confirm anything as we have a strict rule that we can not discuss anyone ’s wedding			0
‘ wherever the wedding will be , there is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for @entity6 in @entity63 and a great deal of pride in him			2
i think people are genuinely very pleased for him			0
