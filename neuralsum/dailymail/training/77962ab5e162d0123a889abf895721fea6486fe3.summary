by @entity0 last updated at 4:34 pm on 30th december 2011 a prisoner of war camp were held is to undergo £ 500,000 worth of repairs after an emergency donation from @entity4			2
@entity5 in @entity6 , which was built to house captured @entity10 and @entity11 prisoners during @entity12 , needs urgent work after it was hit by last year 's sharp winter			1
the sheds , many of them with corrugated rooftops and asbestos panelling , were supposed to be temporary buildings when they were put up in 1943			1
owners : @entity21 and @entity22 tried to sell the camp on @entity24 two years ago and have now received £ 500,000 from @entity26 heritage to carry out emergency repairs however , it has scheduled monument status which means it is nationally important			1
it is the only camp in the country to have the classification			0
the 17 - acre site , which has been run as a tourist attraction since 2004 by its private owners , is being given the funding by @entity4 with no requirement for it to be matched , the @entity33 reported			0
the repair work is being carried out to a theatre and a canteen on the site which are in the poorest state of repair			1
the huts will be clad in timber to stop their condition deteriorating further			0
temporary huts : when the site was built in 1943 the buildings , many of them made from pre-fabricated concrete , were only supposed to last a few years disrepair : this is the @entity55 theatre , pictured in 2002 , which will undergo emergency repairs			1
its state of repair declined dramatically in last winter 's big freeze although the buildings appear ramshackle , they give a remarkable insight into the lives of thousands of @entity66			1
the theatre and the canteen which are undergoing repairs were central to the social life at @entity71			1
although the @entity11 and @entity10 prisoners were forced to work the land locally , many of them did not mind being there			1
indeed , around 10 per cent of the population settled in the area after the war			0
the inmates were humanely treated , encouraged to make themselves at home and even produced their own newspaper			2
as well as the theatre there was football , education classes , gardening opportunities and a local community who were happy to accept them as their own			0
the camp is historically significant because it gives a unique insight into the very ordinary war lives of thousands			0
the theatre has a stage , orchestra pit and tiered flooring			0
the canteen , where the inmates would socialise , had a series of paintings of @entity11 scenes on the wall which have survived			1
in total , there are 49 buildings			2
owners @entity21 and @entity107 put the camp up for sale on @entity24 two years ago - but no one was prepared to match their £ 900,000 asking price			2
they ran out of money while trying to turn the piece of wartime history into a visitor and education centre			0
@entity118 , historic environment adviser at @entity4 , told the @entity33 : ' many people ask why not just record it and let it fall down , but it is the only place where you can see this aspect of our history , and it has a very powerful atmosphere			0
' although the materials were very crude , whatever they could get hold of , the workmanship is excellent , and the theatre was planned by somebody who really knew his job - it has a miniature proscenium arch , an orchestra pit , raked seating , even a prompt box , all fitted into the framework of the hit			0
' the camp was built to house ' low risk ' prisoners of war who were housed in tents before @entity10 pows erected prefabricated buildings			1
by september 1944 most of prisoners had been dispersed to hostels and farms to make way for around 900 @entity11 prisoners originally the camp housed @entity10 prisoners who slept in tents			1
but in the early 1940s huts were erected by @entity10 pows who stayed there until september 1944 when around 900 @entity11 prisoners were transported to the camp			1
prisoners underwent de-nazification classes and although being interned was traumatic for soldiers many were relieved to be out of the war			2
just one person ever tried to escape			0
they were often allowed into town and formed such strong bonds with the local community that around 10 per cent of prisoners stayed in @entity168 rather than return home			2
the prison was a work camp and detainees were taken out daily to work on farms			0
among the detainees was @entity11 pow @entity175 , who became a professional footballer for @entity177 after the war			1
the goalkeeper is famous for playing the full 90 minutes in the 1956 fa cup final , despite breaking his neck 17 minutes from time			0
the sports field at @entity5 is also believed to have been the venue for the first @entity26 v @entity11 post-war football match when the pow camp team took on @entity186			1
after the war it was used for storage by the farmer who owned it before the @entity192 purchased it and formed a trust			0
emergency repairs : work will be carried out to the theatre and canteen			2
the owners ran out of money as they tried to turn it into a tourist attraction productions : @entity204 was a centrepoint of life at the camp to keep up morale			0
here is a theatrical production at another @entity212 camp			2

work will preserve *auditorium* and canteen where @entity212 socialised
temporary buildings at @entity71 , @entity6 , were expected to last a few years
@entity26 heritage make large donation after buildings were *wrecked* by *weather* last winter
@entity225 housed @entity11 and @entity10 prisoners
