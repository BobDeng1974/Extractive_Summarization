@entity0 crashed to a third straight @entity2 defeat and could be in trouble with the @entity4 following crowd trouble in the @entity7 derby			1
the game was stopped for eight minutes after a flare was thrown from the stand housing visiting fans but @entity12 maintained their focus to run out 30 - 10 winners and maintain their impressive form at the @entity16 , where they have taken seven points out of a possible 10 this year			1
@entity0 's losing run is their worst since 2009 and their misery was compounded by the loss of winger @entity22 with a leg injury			0
following a delay caused by a flare , @entity12 condemned @entity0 to a third defeat in a row @entity12 , hammered by @entity28 in their previous outing , were boosted by the return of influential captain @entity31 from a three - match absence with a hamstring injury and the @entity34 had no answer to his half - back partnership with @entity38			1
yet @entity0 could hardly have made a better start , with @entity41 forward @entity40 collecting a rebound from @entity44 's high kick to score the opening try after only five minutes			1
it was eight minutes before @entity44 could add the goal as the game was stopped to enable stewards to clear the flare from the pitch and remove the offenders			1
once back under way , the game flowed from end to end but , while @entity12 scrambled superbly to keep their line intact , the visitors ' defence cracked three times as the @entity61 found some real potency in their attack			2
dangerous full - back @entity64 got centre @entity66 through a gap for the first try on 10 minutes and , after @entity22 had hobbled off , his opposite number @entity71 gathered @entity31 's pinpoint kick for the first of his brace of scores to give his side a lead they never looked like relinquishing			2
@entity12 lost @entity79 to injury on 29 minutes , which paved the way for 19 - year - old @entity82 to make his debut , but they struck again three minutes before the break when @entity38 's cut - out gave @entity71 a clear run for his second try			2
@entity89 managed just one conversion and also missed a long - range penalty attempt on the stroke of half - time but @entity12 took only five minutes of the second half to extend their lead			0
a touchline dash from @entity97 created the position for hooker @entity99 to burrow his way over from dummy half for the softest of tries			0
it went from bad to worse for the visitors when @entity40 was sin - binned following the concession of three consecutive penalties by his team and the @entity61 immediately took advantage of the extra man when @entity31 went through a gap for a fifth try			0
@entity97 converted both tries to make it 26 - 6 but @entity0 pulled a try back on 64 minutes through makeshift centre @entity115 after the home side were down to 12 men with @entity119 in the sin - bin for a foul on @entity122			0
@entity12 fittingly had the final say when @entity97 went over three minutes from the end for his side 's sixth try .			0

@entity0 *slipped* to their third straight defeat in the @entity2
game was delayed for eight minutes after a flare thrown by visiting fans
@entity12 captain captain @entity31 returned to *inspire* them to *victory*
