by @entity0 a mother nearly lost her unborn son when she underwent an invasive fertility procedure without knowing she was pregnant			2
@entity4 , 35 , had her womb and fallopian tubes flushed with dye by doctors investigating why she and her husband @entity8 , 43 , had not been able to conceive after three years of trying			1
the receptionist , from @entity10 , north east @entity11 , discovered three weeks later she had been four weeks pregnant at the time of the test			2
@entity4 and @entity14 nearly lost their son , @entity15 , when mrs @entity4 had an invasive fertility procedure doctors , who before going ahead with the fertility test had ordered a pregnancy test which returned a negative result , told mrs @entity4 they would have expected the dye to have flushed the foetus from her body			1
against the odds , mrs @entity4 ’s son @entity15 developed to full term and next month he will be two years old			1
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ i often think of how close we came to losing @entity15			1
part of me still ca n’t believe he survived and how lucky we are			0
’ mrs @entity4 and her husband , a television presenter and actor , began trying for a child a year after they married in 2007			1
she said : ‘ for the first year of trying we were n’t in any particular rush - we were too busy enjoying our relationship			0
but when another year went by and we still did n’t have any luck , i started to think things were seriously wrong			0
‘ when i was 21 i ’d been told i probably had polycystic ovary syndrome but i had n’t thought much of it			0
now i wondered whether it was going to be an impossible barrier to overcome			0
’ mr and mrs @entity4 had been trying for a baby for three years without success so decided to have a procedure in which mrs @entity4 's womb and fallopian tubes were flushed to remove any blockages mrs @entity4 took a pregnancy test before she underwent the procedure but it came back negative			1
as a result , she did n't know she was pregnant with @entity15 when she had the surgery in august 2011 mrs @entity4 was offered a fertility test through a gynaecological laparoscopy under general anaesthetic at @entity58 in @entity11			1
before undergoing the test , during which dye would be sent through her womb and fallopian tubes to detect and dislodged any blockages , she was given a pregnancy test			1
she said : ‘ i did n’t think there was a lot of point in taking a test - we ’d been trying to conceive for years with no luck			2
so when the test said i was negative i was n’t surprised			2
’ she was told to rest in bed for two weeks , after which she developed some familiar symptoms			0
she said : ‘ i felt nauseous and had been fainting			0
my mum wondered whether i was pregnant and although i laughed her words off at first , it must have had an effect because i took another test			2
doctors were amazed that @entity15 survived the procedure unharmed as they thought he would have been washed out of his mother 's womb by the dye that was flushed through it mrs @entity4 only realised she was pregnant when she started feeling sick and faint and her mother suggested that she should take a pregnancy test ‘ when the result came back as positive , i was overcome with joy			1
i screamed with happiness so loudly that my husband thought i ’d fallen down the stairs			0
’ but the joy was short - lived when a prenatal doctor warned her the dye procedure could have damaged her unborn son			0
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ i had to wait another five weeks until my 12 week scan , when we would find out if my baby was alright			1
‘ we knew the baby had survived , but we did n’t know whether there would be complications			2
no - one knew whether the dye had affected the foetus			0
mrs @entity4 said : ' i often think of how close we came to losing @entity15			1
part of me still ca n't believe he survived and how lucky we are ' mrs @entity4 said : ' when the [ pregnancy test ] came back as positive , i was overcome with joy			1
i screamed with happiness so loudly that my husband thought i 'd fallen down the stairs ' ‘ at first i wondered whether there had been a mix - up with the pregnancy test which was ordered before the dye flushing , but that possibility was discounted			1
my only thought was that my hormones were n’t at the right levels at the previous test			0
’ such fertility tests , performed with keyhole surgery , are quite common and often result in increased fertility among patients because blockages are removed from the reproductive system as the dye makes its way through the body			0
before the tests medics are careful to order pregnancy tests to protect undetected foetuses from being flushed away			0
@entity15 is about to celebrate his second birthday and his parents say they ' love him to bits ' mrs @entity4 ( pictured with her husband on the day they met ) said : ' me and @entity8 are both loud , upbeat people , and @entity15 is like both of us combined			1
he 's always on the go ' amazingly , the 12 - week scan was fine and little @entity15 was born on april 19 , 2012			2
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ me and @entity8 are both loud , upbeat people , and @entity15 is like both of us combined			1
he ’s always on the go and we love him to bits			0
‘ getting to @entity143 this year was joyous			0
‘ behind everything we do as a family is the knowledge of the struggles we went through to have a baby			0
