sir @entity0 pictured in @entity1 this summer , the first sighting of him after police raided his home			1
he is now preparing to sue @entity5 over its coverage sir @entity0 is preparing to sue the @entity5 over its controversial live tv coverage of the police raid on his home			1
the singer will seek damages for breach of privacy if , as he expects , he is not charged over an allegation of historic sexual abuse			2
the @entity15 can reveal that sir @entity0 is also considering legal action against @entity18			1
the force struck a deal with the corporation to film the swoop on his £ 3 million penthouse			0
in august the @entity5 faced an avalanche of criticism from leading lawyers , celebrities and politicians after it dispatched a helicopter to hover over the @entity31 property and stationed reporters at its gates before police had even arrived			1
cameramen in the air were able to zoom in on officers through the windows as they searched through belongings			0
sir @entity0 , who vigorously denies any wrongdoing and has not been arrested , was in @entity1 at the time			1
‘ no citizen should have to watch on live television their home being raided in this way , ’ concluded a blistering @entity42 report			2
sir @entity0 ’s lawyer @entity48 denounced the ‘ premature and disproportionate ’ reporting which caused the veteran entertainment ‘ immeasurable harm ’			1
friends say sir @entity0 is now determined to launch a concerted fightback			1
as his association with the @entity5 goes back to the start of his career – he appeared on @entity57 in 1961 and on the first episode of @entity60 in 1964 – legal action is likely to cause acute embarrassment			2
the singer was said to be dismayed to learn of the extent of co-operation between @entity18 and the @entity5 in the weeks leading up to the raid			0
as the @entity42 noted last month , not only did the force give the broadcaster the date of the search , it also ‘ handed over a great deal of information freely ’			0
this newspaper can disclose that emails , text messages and other documents given to the committee show that the @entity5 : one legal expert said last night that the level of intrusion meant sir @entity0 would have a ‘ strong case ’ and added that the @entity5 would struggle to mount a public interest defence			1
the police investigation began when a man , now in his 40s , came forward earlier this year to claim sir @entity0 sexually assaulted him during a @entity86 rally in @entity87 organised by @entity88 , the @entity89 evangelist , in 1985			1
the @entity5 were able to capture images of police arriving at the property as they received advanced notice of the raid and sent a helicopter to hover overhead , hundreds of politicians , celebrities and lawyers complained over the @entity5 's coverage - which showed police officers going room - to - room ( pictured ) - saying it made the singer look guilty the @entity5 ’s @entity103 first contacted @entity18 about the allegation in @entity105 and spoke to @entity106 , head of corporate communications			1
in a letter , @entity108 recalled that @entity103 was able to ‘ detail the allegation , accurately and the location the allegation related to			0
' specifically he spoke about a boy aged between 11 and 14 alleging that he had been taken to a room ... where he was made to carry out a sexual act			0
’ a month before the raid , @entity108 sent @entity103 an email asking if he would like her to ‘ set something up with the officer in the celebrity case ’			0
he replies : ‘ that would be fab			0
’ notes from the meeting show that @entity103 asked if the @entity5 could accompany officers during the search of sir @entity0 ’s home			1
unsurprisingly , the request was turned down			0
however , fearing @entity103 was about to break the story prematurely , police felt they had no choice but to deal with him and agreed to give him advance notice of the raid			2
in fact the head of the investigation , detective superintendent @entity135 would later say the force had been ‘ effectively blackmailed ’			0
over the next few weeks , dozens of emails and texts were exchanged between the force and the reporter			0
in one email , on july 18 , @entity103 asked if the @entity5 could speak to the alleged victim			1
he said he was worried the alleged victim might tip off other media about the raid			2
he asked @entity108 : ‘ i do n’t know how closely you ’re keeping him updated on progress and plans			0
i would n’t want him becoming aware of progress through our interest , prompting him to ... alert other media ’			0
@entity5 reporter @entity159 speaks to camera as cars leave sir @entity0 's house			1
the @entity5 coverage of the raid was the first time the musician was aware of the police sting @entity18 say they were given no choice but to hand details of the raid to @entity170 , for fear that he would reveal the operation ahead of time @entity106 , press chief for the force , messaged mr @entity170 a month ahead of the raid asking whether she should ‘ set something up with the officer in the celebrity case ’			1
he replied : ‘ that would be fab			0
’ @entity108 responded that the ‘ complainant is being kept up to date to an extent but i ’ll make the team aware of your concerns ’			0
at this point she warns @entity103 that the inquiry is n’t ‘ progressing as quickly as thought ’ because ‘ there does n’t seem to be a @entity190 address ’			1
it might mean , she adds , that officers will ‘ need to go and try one of the foreign ones [ @entity0 owns homes in @entity1 and the @entity195 ]			2
' we are considering which one would operationally be the better choice			0
’ eventually they did find sir @entity0 ’s @entity31 address , and tipped off @entity103 the night before the raid			1
helpfully , one of @entity108 ’s team sent the reporter an aerial photograph of the property and said : ‘ from what i ’ve been told by officers who are down there now there wo n’t be much to see from the street			2
’ at 10.20am the following day , with the police poised to swoop on the apartment , @entity103 exchanged text messages with a police media officer , @entity215			0
he asked : ‘ you parked underground ? helicopter ca n’t see you ’			2
card replies : ‘ no we ’re not parked near the property at this time – while we wait to hear bout entry , we ’re parked off in the grounds somewhere			0
’ @entity103 then asks : ‘ have you managed to get in his place ? ’			2
he is told : ‘ yes , we have managed to gain entry			1
’ he later asks : ‘ give me a shout before they take anything out , so we can get the chopper in place for a shot			2
’ when asked about the legal action , a spokesman for sir @entity0 declined to comment			1
the singer , who was interviewed under caution by police ten days after the raid , has described the allegation against him as ‘ completely false ’			2
he has received huge support from the public and has continued to work			0
next september he will embark on his 75th birthday tour , which has just added a sixth date at @entity243 ’s @entity242			0
‘ i am moved by the support the fans have shown , and am very much looking forward to seeing them on the tour next year , ’ he said			0
after broadcasting live , the @entity5 received hundreds of complaints from viewers , with many saying that the coverage made the singer look guilty			0
@entity251 mp said the police acted ' entirely properly ' in their dealings with the @entity5 , but that their coverage had caused ' irreparable damage ' ( pictured , the head of @entity18 speaks to mps over the incident ) yesterday , @entity259 , 83 , the tv producer credited with turning sir @entity0 into a star in the late 1950s , called the broadcast ‘ shameful ’			1
sir @entity262 , 79 , a former @entity5 journalist , described it as a ‘ witch - hunt ’ and attacked the corporation for an ‘ error of judgment ’			1
former shadow home secretary @entity267 said : ‘ the decision by the leadership of @entity271 police to allow the searching of sir @entity0 ’s house to be televised , like some morally challenged reality tv show , demonstrates there is something sick at the heart of @entity190 ’s police and justice system			1
’ however , @entity42 chairman @entity251 said the @entity5 acted ‘ perfectly properly ’ in its dealings with police over the raid , but the coverage had caused sir cliff ‘ enormous , irreparable damage ’			1
last night the @entity5 said the @entity42 ‘ has already endorsed the way the @entity5 handled this story			2
we have nothing further to add ’			0
@entity18 said : ‘ while we believe our actions in relation to dealing with the media were within policy and were well - intended , they were ultimately flawed and we regret the additional anxiety which was caused to sir @entity0			1
