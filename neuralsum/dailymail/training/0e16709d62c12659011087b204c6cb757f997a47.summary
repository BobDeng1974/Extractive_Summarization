this never - before - seen @entity1 photograph shows the real rabbit who inspired @entity5 's famous character @entity6			1
the adorable pet , named @entity8 before his literary transformation , lived with ms @entity5 from 1885 until he died in 1892			2
he would would not appear in her novels until 1904 , but the @entity12 rabbit - one of several she owned - clearly left a lasting impression			0
inspiration : @entity8 is pictured here in the late 1880s or early 1890s			0
he would later become @entity6 in @entity5 's novels he was supposed to feature in @entity17 - the first book in the series , from 1902 , but was later edited out before starring in @entity6 two years later			1
the author gave the photograph to the children of @entity22 , who was the art director at @entity23 , a pottery company which had been modelling characters from her tales			0
she wrote on the back of the picture postcard : ' for mr. @entity31 children - this is a photograph of the real old original mr @entity6 - he was a @entity12 rabbit , very tame & clever			1
' it has been suggested that ms @entity5 's father @entity35 may have taken the picture rather than the author herself , as mr @entity38 was known to have an interest in photography			2
message : ms @entity5 wrote this postcard to the children of mr @entity22 , whose descendants have now sold it the 5.5ins by 3.5in card has now been sold for Â£ 1,100 by a descendant in the @entity48 at @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51			0
@entity52 , chairman of the @entity5 , said : ' @entity8 was a @entity12 rabbit and was the first of @entity5 's pet rabbits			1
' he was acquired in about 1885			0
she brought him home from a @entity58 pet shop and brought him home in a paper bag			0
iconic : @entity5 's elegant watercolours of her beloved rabbits , such as the one pictured , helped make her books an enduring success owner : @entity5 , pictured , spoke warmly of ' the real old original mr @entity6 ' ' we think the photograph on the postcard was taken by @entity5 herself , though it could have been taken by her father , who was a prolific photographer			1
' we know quite a lot about @entity8 because @entity5 wrote about him in her journal , and he was the model for most of the rabbits in her early published work in the 1890s - greetings cards and so on - that predated the little books			1
' in @entity6 , the title character joins his cousin @entity81 to return to mr @entity83 's garden and look for the clothes @entity85 left there in the first book			2
during the risky escapade , the two bunnies become trapped under a basket by mr @entity83 's cat and have to be rescued by @entity8 's father .			0
