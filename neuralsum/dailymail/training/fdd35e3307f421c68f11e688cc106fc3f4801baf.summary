a tiny village in central @entity1 is appealing for funds to help preserve the bedroom of a @entity5 soldier that has remained completely unchanged since his death in 1918			1
dragoons ' second lieutenant @entity8 died in the back of a @entity12 field ambulance after being wounded during fighting for the village of @entity14 in @entity15 almost 100 years ago			1
his body was originally buried in a @entity12 cemetery , and his parents , who initially had no idea where their son 's body was , decided to preserve his old bedroom as a permanent shrine			2
time capsule : the bedroom of @entity5 soldier @entity8 which has remained untouched for almost 100 years			1
the local mayor is appealing for funds to help preserve the unique historical site second lieutenant @entity8 's body was eventually repatriated to his home village of @entity31 in 1922 , but his parents decided to continue to keep his room exactly as it had been when he left to fight in the war			1
when they sold the large family house in 1936 , they bricked up the entrance to the room and stipulated that it should not be changed for another 500 years			1
the house was sold to @entity1 general @entity39 who went on to become secretary of state during the @entity42 regime helping to deport thousands of @entity43 to @entity45 concentration camps			1
@entity39 escaped the death sentence for war crimes by fleeing to @entity48 where he died in 1955			0
meanwhile the house was rented to a family of solicitors before being reclaimed in the 1950s by his granddaughter whose husband @entity53 still lives there			2
relics : the fallen soldier 's medals sit on the wrought iron bed alongside pictures of his friends who also died in the war , left , while a moth - eaten uniform still hangs from the wall mr @entity53 has preserved the bedroom in its original state and said he hopes any new owner will do the same			2
the bedroom has since remained untouched but there are fears that a future owner could clear it out as the 500 year clause in the original 1936 sale document has no basis under @entity1 law			1
mr @entity53 told the @entity78 newspaper : ' this clause had no legal basis , but we believe the room should be left unchanged			1
' if we sell , we will be looking for a new owner that respects @entity8 's memory and keeps this extraordinary museum piece intact			1
' now the mayor of @entity87 is appealing for benefactors to help preserve the unique historical site by transforming it into a museum			0
he told the @entity92 : ' they knew about the room at the end of the corridor but had never seen it because it was bricked up			0
so they broke down the wall and made this strange discovery			0
' it would be a great shame for it to disappear			0
as someone who loves history , i feel it 's also important not to forget the sacrifice made by men like @entity8			2
' @entity8 , who was born in @entity31 in 1896 , received a posthumous @entity108 and the @entity109 for his courage in battle - the medals now sit on his old bed surrounded by photographs of his friends who also died in the war			2
on his desk a pipe sits still filled with tobacco alongside a packet of cigarettes and a vial labelled ' the soil of @entity124 on which our dear child fell and which has kept his remains for four years			0

' a moth - eaten army uniform is still on its hanger			0
schoolbooks and military manuals still sit on the shelves while the walls are adorned with his sword , a fencing helmet and a collection of pistols			0
the regiment 's history , seen by the @entity92 , records @entity8 's commander was killed by a bullet to the head after giving a ' heroic ' order to counter-attack in @entity14 , which changed hands several times			1
@entity8 , a second lieutenant with the @entity154 based in @entity155 , near @entity156 , received a posthumous @entity108 medal for his extreme bravery on the battlefield			2
he was one of 580,000 soldiers who died on that part of the western front in the 1914 - 18 war			0
he is also remembered on the village war memorial and on a monument to the fallen in @entity155 .			0

dragoon @entity8 was killed in @entity15 in 1918 but his parents preserved his room as a shrine
they sold the house to @entity1 general in 1932 stipulating the room should remain as it is for 500 years
*current* owner has respected their wishes and says if he sells he would seek a buyer willing to retain the *tradition*
but there are fears a future owner may decide to clear the room as the 500 years clause has no legal basis
