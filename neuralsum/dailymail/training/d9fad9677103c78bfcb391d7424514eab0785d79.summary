@entity0 has warned @entity2 nations they must respect national deficit targets after @entity4 backed off promises to reduce overspending			1
speaking in @entity9 today , the @entity8 chancellor said eurozone nations must commit to stability , adding that @entity2 's economy is ' still too fragile ' for nations to fall back into heavy borrowing			1
her comments come as a clear warning to socialist @entity4 , whose deficit actually rose in 2014 , and whose budget for 2015 shreds promises to reduce the deficit below three per cent within two years			1
anger : in a clear warning to @entity4 's socialist president @entity23 ( pictured left in @entity9 today ) , @entity8 chancellor @entity0 ( right ) said @entity2 nations must respect national deficit targets the @entity26 executive will decide over the coming weeks whether to force member countries to revise their budgets , and @entity4 risks an embarrassing ' fail ' from @entity29			1
patience among other @entity26 countries that had to make budget cuts of their own is also wearing thin			2
without naming @entity4 , @entity0 noted in a speech to @entity36 that @entity26 leaders in june recommitted themselves to the @entity26 's budget rules , known as the stability and growth pact			1
' all , and i stress again all , member states must respect in full the rules of the strengthened stability and growth pact , ' she said			0
' these rules must be applied credibly to all member states - only then can the pact fulfill its function as a central anchor for stability and above all for confidence in the eurozone			0
' @entity2 's economic recovery ' is still too fragile for us simply to go back to business as usual , ' she added			0
address : @entity8 chancellor @entity0 speaks in the lower house of @entity8 's parliament in @entity9 today a string of disappointing economic data from @entity8 , the eurozone 's biggest economy , has deepened concerns over prospects for the 18 - nation currency area 's recovery			1

despite calls from abroad for @entity9 to pump money into the economy , @entity0 is determined to stick to plans to get by without new borrowing next year			2
that , along with a pledge not to raise taxes , was a central feature of her election campaign last year			0
' i think we can show in @entity8 that growth and investment can be strengthened without having to leave the ( budget ) consolidation course , ' she said			0
' it is business and companies that create jobs and innovation - so , if we want growth in @entity2 , this must above all be about mobilizing private capital			0
' next monday , the finance and economy ministers of @entity8 and @entity4 are to meet in @entity9 to discuss ways of encouraging investment .			2
