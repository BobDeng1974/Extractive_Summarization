@entity0 might have been in good form since returning from injury this season , but he still needs to be better if @entity4 are to challenge for the title , according to @entity7 legend @entity6			1
the @entity11 , a member of the @entity7 ' @entity10 team , labelled the @entity12 ' slow ' and says he has to be more decisive			2

@entity0 has not found things easy since moving to @entity4 , but has improved recently @entity0 has a shot deflected over the bar against @entity21 , and @entity6 says he must offer more ' you speak about @entity4 and how they do n't spend big money on a player often but they did with ( @entity25 ) @entity0 and it is always a bit risky , ' he said			1
' coming from @entity29 it is tough to adapt , it does n't always happen straight away			0
' i do really like him as a player but sometimes in the game he does look quite slow , although he has that quality to change the game			0
' he can be more decisive for @entity4 for the quality he has , he can be much more decisive for the club			2
@entity4 have not won the @entity37 in the 11 years since @entity6 and his team - mates went unbeaten , and the 38 - year - old believes they still do n't have the financial firepower to challege @entity41 and @entity42			1

' @entity4 has n't been able to compete with @entity41 and @entity42 for a few years because they spend money on big names and this is not the @entity4 culture ' , said @entity6			2
' they do n't spend a lot of money to sign players but apart from that it is not easy to find a way to get back on track to win titles			0
@entity0 is the @entity7 record signing , but in general the club has not tried to compete with rich clubs financially the @entity12 playmaker will need to improve if @entity4 are to mount a serious title challenge , says @entity6 ' it was important for them last season that they won the @entity69 but a team like @entity4 need more and i hope they find a way to achieve what they always look for			1
' if you look at @entity41 , they spent a lot of money on a player like @entity78 and he has settled really well and is scoring lots of goals , that has worked for them but it is not as easy for @entity4			2
' if the players concentrate on their job and pull together they can form a strong team and try to feel good in their play			0
' sometimes people expect quick results but it does n't always work like that			0
