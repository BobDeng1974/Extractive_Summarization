@entity0 has set up a task force to evaluate its sexual assault policy after a student penned a scathing op - ed about the @entity7 university 's indifference to her alleged attack			1
the student , who wrote the letter anonymously for the @entity11 , said staff discouraged her from pursuing charges against her attacker , meaning she is still living in the same dorm as he is			1
following the emotional response to the article , @entity0 's @entity17 has set up a task force to discuss the university 's sexual assault policy , which the student branded ' outdated '			1
@entity26 officials sent a letter to undergraduates saying they will support the group , @entity24 reported			1
a @entity0 student has written a damning open letter attacking the @entity26 's indifference to an alleged sexual assault from another student ' @entity37 as an institution and as a community deplores sexual violence and is committed to its prevention and to supporting its victims , ' @entity35 , dean of student life , wrote in the letter			1
' sexual harassment and sexual assault can never be tolerated			1
he said that the results of the task force would be shared with the entire community			1
he added : ' to build a community free of sexual violence and harassment will require all of us working together			2
we take this issue very seriously and it is our hope that no student feels discouraged from reporting an incident			2
' it comes just days after the student wrote in the letter titled ' dear @entity0 : you win ' that the alleged incident happened in a friend 's dorm room on a friday night ' after too many drinks ' last year			1
she said the attacker took her shirt off and started biting her skin			0
' i pushed back on his chest and asked him to stop kissing me aggressively			0
he said that i should ' just wear a scarf ' to cover the marks			0
he continued to abuse my body			0
' i was intoxicated , i was in pain , i was trapped between him and the wall , and i was scared to death that he would continue to ignore what i said			0
lack of support : the student claims she was discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because her assault did not fit the narrow language of @entity0 's student handbook ( file photo ) ' i stopped everything and turned my back to him , praying he would leave me alone			1
' she writes how he started getting impatient and made an explicit demand to which she wrote : ' it did not sound like a question			2
' the student then writes that she was discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because her assault did not fit the narrow language of @entity0 ’s student handbook , written in 1993			1
' when i told my @entity101 that i was considering an @entity103 process , i was told it was a bad time of the semester , that there would be consequences for my assailant anyway , and that we should n’t go through the process if it was going to be fruitless , ' she wrote			2
' shortly after , my resident dean told me that my assailant could n’t be punished because he did n’t know what he was doing			0
the resident dean compared living in the same @entity101 as my assailant to a divorced couple working in the same factory			0
' she explains that although she was offered the chance to move to another @entity101 early on she declined because ' transferring felt utterly disempowering			0
moving to a different @entity101 would have felt like giving up and granting even more power to my assailant			0
' she said she is now on anti-depressants and is now falling behind on her school work because she finds it difficult seeing her alleged attacker up to five times a day			0
' i spend most of my time outside of class curled up in bed , crying , sleeping , or staring at the ceiling , occasionally wondering if i just heard my assailant ’s voice in the staircase			0
' she added : ' i will be moving out of my @entity101 next semester , if only - quite literally - to save my life			0
' according to the @entity135 , 19 percent of undergraduate women experience attempted or completed sexual assault since starting college			1
according to @entity140 per cent of college women who are raped tell no one about the assault .			2
