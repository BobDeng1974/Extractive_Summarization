it includes satellite images of what are described as prison labor camps and penitentiaries			0
the report documents the alleged incarceration of whole families , including children and grandparents for the ' political crimes ' of other family members			1

' it is not just nuclear weapons that have to be dismantled , ' said @entity59 , chair of the committee 's board of directors , ' but an entire system of political repression			1
' the report says the camp system was initially modeled in the 1950s on the @entity10 gulag , to punish ' wrong thinkers ' and those belonging to the ' wrong political class ' or religious persuasion			0
it cites estimates from @entity8 state security agency officials who defected to @entity55 that the camp system holds between 150,000 and 200,000 people - out of a total population of around 24 million			1
