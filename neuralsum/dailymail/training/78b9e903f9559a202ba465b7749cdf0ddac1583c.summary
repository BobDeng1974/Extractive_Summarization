the under - 25s will be stripped of their benefits to ensure they either ‘ earn or learn ’ , @entity0 announced yesterday			1
unveiling a new crackdown on welfare , the prime minister said young people will no longer be able to ‘ opt for a life on benefits ’			1
the plans will mean that school leavers either have to take a job or an apprenticeship or remain in education or training			1
those who refuse will face sanctions , including the loss of out - of - work benefits			1
mr @entity0 told the @entity29 conference that the move was necessary because one million young people were not in education , employment or training			1
he said : ‘ today it is still possible to leave school , sign on , find a flat , start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits			1
it ’s time for bold action here			2
‘ we should ask , as we write our next manifesto , if that option should really exist at all			2
instead , we should give young people a clear , positive choice : go to school			2
’ mr @entity0 said the government should not allow young people to ‘ just choose the dole			2
' we ’ve got to offer them something better than that			0
’ address : the @entity61 leader told delegates that further reforms to the welfare state , schools and the economy were needed he added : ‘ this is what we want to see : everyone under 25 earning or learning			1
’ the savings could be considerable			0
the @entity72 says there are 410,000 under - 25s claiming @entity28 at a cost of £ 1.2billion a year , while 380,000 young people are on housing benefit at a cost of £ 1.8billion			1
the cuts are likely to be controversial since 169,000 of the young housing benefit recipients are single mothers and another 32,000 are couples with children			0
the prime minister and work and pensions secretary @entity84 were originally planning to strip housing benefit from the under - 25s altogether – a suggestion floated by mr @entity0 in his conference speech last year			1
but that plan foundered because it was opposed by the @entity90			0
mr @entity0 and deputy prime minister @entity91 have asked cabinet secretary sir @entity92 to draw up a report into training and education for the under - 25s			1
under existing rules , young jobless people lose their benefits if they train for more than 16 hours a week			1
serious : mr @entity0 's speech was widely seen as an echo of @entity102 's pitch to voters in 1992 , that the job of repairing @entity105 is not yet complete as a result , the system pays them if they are not in training – but stops supporting them when they do			1
the @entity92 review is looking at ways to support young people after they have started training programmes			0
sir @entity92 will report back in the autumn			0
the @entity29 aim to persuade the @entity90 to back the new sanctions regime			1
if they refuse , the @entity61 will ‘ definitely ’ put the measure in their election manifesto in 2015 , sources said			2
last night a senior @entity90 source said mr @entity91 would wait until he has read sir @entity92 ’s report , but voiced concern that the scheme would work only if there were enough jobs or training places to offer people			0
‘ you need carrot as well as stick , ’ the source said			0
‘ there are one million young people out of work and there are not enough jobs for them to go into			0
’ not there yet : @entity0 warned delegates at the @entity29 party conference in @entity143 that there was a ' long way ' to go before @entity105 was out of the woods mr @entity0 conceded that the cuts will be seized on by opponents as ‘ callous ’ , but added : ‘ with your children , would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices , not getting a job , not training , nothing ? no – you ’d nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way			1
’ he accused @entity161 of being ‘ intensely relaxed about people staying stuck on welfare year after year ’ , and added : ‘ we do n’t patronise people , put a benefit cheque in their hand and pat them on the head			0
we look people in the eye as equals and say : “ yes , you ’ve been down – but you ’re not out , you can do it , you have it in you , we will give you that chance ”			0
’ a @entity161 source said : ‘ this is an empty and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that there was absolutely nothing in @entity0 ’s speech to deal with the cost - of - living crisis facing families			2
’ @entity184 , backed a free school in @entity186 , @entity0 said @entity0 accused @entity161 of double standards on free schools by highlighting the ‘ unbelievable ’ record of shadow education secretary @entity184			2
the prime minister said mr @entity184 , mp for @entity191 , opposed free schools nationally but had backed one in @entity186			0
it comes after the @entity194 revealed last week that at least 21 @entity195 – including four members of the shadow cabinet – are supporting local free schools			0
mr @entity0 told the @entity29 conference : ‘ you want to know something totally extraordinary about free schools ? ' @entity161 ’s official policy is to be against them but – get this – @entity195 are backing them in their local area			1
and not just any @entity195			0
‘ i promise i ’m not making this up : the shadow education secretary , @entity184 , has backed one in his own city			2
’ the prime minister added : ‘ is n’t that always the way with the @entity213 ? they do n’t like privilege – unless , of course , it ’s for their own children			0
’ mr @entity184 has praised the @entity219 in @entity186 as ‘ inspiring ’ , and shadow health secretary @entity220 attended the ‘ founders ’ ceremony ’ for the @entity223 free school in his @entity225 constituency .			0
