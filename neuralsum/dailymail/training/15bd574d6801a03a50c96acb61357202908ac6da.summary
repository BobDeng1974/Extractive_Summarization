by @entity0 published : 05:05 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 10:04 est , 17 january 2013 a family of five had a lucky escape after arriving home to find their bathroom ablaze after sunlight reflected from a shaving mirror set their towels alight			1
pregnant mother - of - three @entity10 arrived home to find her house in @entity14 filled with smoke and her bathroom towels ablaze			1
mrs @entity10 , 35 , called the fire service who were initially baffled as to how the fire could have started			1
hazard : pregnant @entity10 and her husband @entity22 , pictured left , found their @entity14 house filled with smoke after a magnifying shaving mirror , pictured right , left near a window caused a towel to catch fire but after checks on the electrics proved fine , investigators believe the fire had been started by sun reflecting onto a towel from a nearby high - magnification shaving mirror			1
the full time mother , who is pregnant with the couple 's fourth child , said : ' i got home on friday afternoon and there was a strong smell and i could see smoke			1
' as i went upstairs the smoke got thicker but luckily the fire was over by the time i got home , as there was nowhere for it to spread			2
' the towel had been completely destroyed by the fire - it was just a heap of ashes			2
it was very lucky that it had not caught onto something else			0
' the fire service arrived and were baffled as to what happened			0
initially it was thought it must have been something to do with the electrics			0
' the light fitting for the pull cord was burnt and smoke damaged so we thought that must be right			0
but the fire service checked and there was nothing wrong with the electrics			0
' a fire officer then told me it could be the sun coming through the window , reflecting off the shaving mirror and then onto a flammable towel			1
' i cleaned the bathroom that morning and moved the mirror so the magnifying side was facing the window			1
' lucky escape : the couple - pictured with their three children , @entity78 aged five , @entity81 aged eight and @entity83 aged three - called the fire brigade before the blaze managed to spread further mrs @entity10 , who lives with husband @entity86 , 34 , and children @entity88 , eight , @entity78 , five and @entity83 , three , added : ' it 's important that people are aware of the dangers these mirrors can pose			1
' i have three young children to look after and we are lucky that the towel did not set fire to anything else			0
' the fire service , who were absolutely brilliant , certainly thinks we had a very lucky escape			0
' these magnifying mirrors are common now in many bathrooms and can be bought very cheaply			0
' i feel that the public need to be warned of this fire hazard risk , and perhaps manufacturers should put a warning on their mirrors			0
' they put warning signs on cups of coffee to say they are hot so why not explain the fire risk on bathroom mirrors ? ' @entity115 and @entity116 are now advising householders to think about the positioning of magnifying mirrors , in relation to windows , and to consider any possible fire hazards which could be caused by the sun being reflected by these mirrors			1
a spokesman for @entity126 said : ' at 2.42pm on friday we were called to a private house in @entity129 , @entity130 , where there had been a small fire involving a towel on an electric hand - rail			1
' it is believed that the fire happened sometime between 9am and 2pm that day in a converted en - suite bathroom situated in the loft of the building			2
' it is believed that the fire may have been accidentally started as a result of the sun being reflected onto the hanging towel by a high - magnification shaving mirror nearby			2
' @entity144 provided fire safety advice to the occupiers of the property			0
