by @entity0 a military wife has given her husband a saucy surprise by stripping down to her underwear for a photo shoot			1
@entity6 , 44 , from @entity7 , used to be so self conscious she even refused to have photographs taken at her wedding to husband @entity11 , an @entity12 police officer			1
but after @entity11 was posted to @entity14 for a six - month tour she missed him so much that she plucked up the courage to pose for the sexy snaps			1
@entity6 had the tasteful photos of her posing in lingerie done and sent an album of pictures to her husband on his tour of duty @entity6 , left , hates having her picture taken so much she had no photographer on her wedding day , but plucked up the courage to do the shoot to surprise her husband @entity31 who was on tour in @entity14 she had the tasteful photos of her posing in lingerie done and sent an album as a surprise for @entity11 , 44 , who is now having one of the snaps tattooed on his calf			1
@entity6 had the photo shoot done by @entity41 - based @entity40 who runs @entity43			1
' i ’m hopeless at having my photo taken , i really do n’t like it , ' said @entity6			2
' it bothers me so much we did n't have a photographer at our wedding			0
@entity6 's husband @entity11 , an @entity12 police officer , is now going to have one of the pictures tattooed on his calf ' it was a really big step for me to have photos taken professionally but also scantily clad because i am very conscious of my body			1
' i thought i needed to do something to boost my ego and to cheer up @entity11 in @entity14			1
' i came across @entity40 's website , and the fact she is a woman was a bit plus point			0
i could n't have done this with a male photographer			0
' i did n't tell @entity11 , and sent the photos as a complete surprise			2
whenever he felt low he would look at the photos in his tent to cheer himself up , and that was the whole point of sending them			0
' communication is limited in @entity14 , and it ’s not the same as having the person next to you			2
' really , the photos were an ego boost for me , especially as we did n't have any wedding photos			0
' she added : ' if you speak to any military wife you get to a low ebb when your partner is away			0
the initial first two weeks is a novelty and you go back to being a single person coping on your own			0
' but halfway through the tour the loneliness kicks in , not just for me but for @entity11 too			1
' @entity40 's package also includes a makeover from a professional hair and makeup stylist			0
she said : ' boudoir photography is a must - do experience for women who like to treat themselves to a good old fashioned confidence boost			2
@entity6 says doing the raunchy shoot has vastly improved her self confidence ' we put a huge emphasis on having a fabulous experience , as well as amazing photographs at the end of it			1
i love seeing women blossom in front of me and hearing their reactions once they have seen the photographs			0
' let 's face it , it takes some courage to pose in your lingerie and have your photograph taken			2
i usually find that after the initial few shots any nerves my clients have fade and it becomes a really enjoyable experience			0
