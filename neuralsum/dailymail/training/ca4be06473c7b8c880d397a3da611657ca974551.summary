' @entity3 was seeking advice as to divorce and the financial arrangements which would follow			0
' according to things she said to others , the reason she sought a divorce arose largely out of the defendant â€™s drinking , culminating with an incident in october when he was stopped by the police as he was driving his vehicle and had drunk in excess of the legal limit			0

' mr @entity84 said @entity11 had threatened his wife with a knife a few weeks before her death and that ' in drink he had become a bully and a dangerous one at that '			2
he added : ' no doubt the defendant bitterly regrets his actions that night but it is clear from what he has said that he does seek to justify his actions , at least in part , by painting a picture of his wife and her conduct which is not a true picture			0
' whether it was the revelation that his wife was seeking financial advice of her own or something else that happened , this man , with 10 pints inside him , lost his temper but still had the presence of mind to go into the kitchen , select a knife from the drawer and go after his wife with it			0
