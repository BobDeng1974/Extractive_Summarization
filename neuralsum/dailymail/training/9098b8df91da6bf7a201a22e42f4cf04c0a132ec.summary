@entity0 is on the verge of becoming a lost art as sales of pre-shelled nuts continue to rise a digital ‘ e-card ’ is n’t a patch on a paper @entity7 greeting			1
a @entity11 call with @entity12 is no replacement for sitting on his knee			0
and a packet of pre-shelled walnuts is no substitute for the joy of spraying bits of shell shrapnel across the living room as you smash them up			0
nevertheless , nutcracking is on the verge of becoming a lost art. it seems we just ca n’t be bothered to break into the @entity7 nuts ourselves			1
for example , while sales of pre-shelled nuts and fruit - and - nut mixtures at @entity33 are up by 60 per cent compared with a year ago , sales of whole nuts in shells are down			1
iron lever nutcrackers date back to the 13th century			1
the first use of the term in the @entity39 language was in 1481 , when the @entity40 recorded a dozen nutcrackers being traded			1
the mothballing of the nut - cracker would not just be bad news for those who enjoy taking their frustration out on some macadamias as another family argument breaks out			1
and our festive decor would be poorer — an overflowing basket of nuts in their shells is a visual delight			1
the change depresses @entity56 , writer of more than 70 cookbooks , who says : ‘ i like the experience of nutcracking more than the eating			0
even the flavour is different			0
they taste so fresh , unlike the way they taste already shelled			0
‘ and it ’s good for kids to see where nuts actually come from — and that they do n’t grow in plastic packets			1
’ furthermore , a recent study found that snackers who eat nuts in shells consume fewer calories than those who opt for the pre-shelled variety			1
the simple trick works because the sight of the piles of discarded shells acts as a visual reminder of how much you have eaten and discourages you from over-indulging			0
so , for those keen to cling onto a @entity86 tradition , which are the nutcrackers worth shelling out for ? if you want one in time for @entity7 , make sure you order today ( the last day for @entity88 to deliver first class packages in time ) , or if you wait until next week , ensure your order is being delivered by courier			1
@entity94 nutcracker , £ 69 , @entity95 @entity96 @entity94 nutcracker £ 69 , @entity95 @entity94 is loved by its customers for its sleek @entity101 design — but do n’t expect it to come cheap			0
this £ 69 cracker , made of polished stainless steel , would be a beautiful addition to any mantelpiece as much as a functional kitchen utensil			0
you simply flick the tail forward for the little squirrel to tap open the nut with its paws , and the wooden base has holes of two sizes to accommodate smaller and larger nuts			1
the gizmo is solid and does crack the nuts , but it lacks the control that a hand - held nutcracker would give you and some nuts take several tries to break			1
in a nutshell : style over substance , but such style			0

@entity225 @entity227 nutcracker from 99p , @entity228 this novelty nutcracker may or may not be on the @entity7 lists of die - hard fans of mrs t , depending on how offbeat their sense of humour			2
ironically , this version of the @entity237 is actually made of plastic and as such feels fairly flimsy when dealing with hard nuts , and leaves you worrying that a leg might shatter at any moment			2
