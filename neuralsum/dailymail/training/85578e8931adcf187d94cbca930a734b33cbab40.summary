@entity0 is paid £ 800 a month by the taxpayer – or £ 9,600 a year – as the @entity3 assistant of fellow @entity4 mep @entity4 @entity7 's wife is being paid by the taxpayer to work in @entity3 , it has emerged a day after he denied it on television			1
the @entity12 leader had insisted that his @entity14 wife @entity13 , who is employed as his assistant , is only paid by the party and does not receive a penny from public funds			1
he was questioned about the arrangements during his bizarre appearance this week on ‘ @entity21 and @entity22 @entity7 ’ featuring the drink - swilling bed and breakfast owners from @entity26 ’s @entity25			2
but a day after the programme was broadcast , it has emerged that mrs @entity0 is in fact paid £ 800 a month by the taxpayer – or £ 9,600 a year – as the @entity3 assistant of fellow @entity4 mep @entity4			1
yesterday a spokesman for mr @entity7 admitted this was the case but said the reason for denying it was that her husband had been ‘ completely unaware ’ of this arrangement			1
it was claimed that up until may this year mr @entity7 did pay his second wife around £ 30,000 - a - year until @entity41 rules outlawed the employment of family members			1

’ he said she was paid by ‘ the party ’			0
a @entity4 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ after the rules were changed so hiring spouses was no longer on , @entity7 did a deal with the party that they would pick up the tab			2
' i think he was still smarting a bit because he did n’t think there was anything wrong with paying his wife			0
what seems to have happened is that @entity13 then made a deal with @entity4 which @entity7 was completely unaware of			1
‘ there is no way @entity7 would have been so specific in saying she was not paid taxpayers money if he had known			0
he would have said one of my colleagues has chipped in			0
