thousands - perhaps millions - of various types of fish , some endangered , have died in the @entity3 , as record summer temperatures dry up rivers and raise water temperatures in some spots to nearly 100 degrees			1
about 40,000 shovelnose sturgeon were killed in @entity9 last week as the water reached 97 degrees			1
meanwhile , @entity12 fishery officials said they 've seen thousands of dead sturgeon , catfish , carp , and other species , including the endangered pallid sturgeon , in the @entity18			1
and @entity20 biologists said the hot weather has killed tens of thousands of large - and smallmouth bass - and channel catfish , and is threatening the population of the greater redhorse fish , a state - endangered species			1
thousands , perhaps millions of fish like these from a @entity29 pond are dying in the @entity3 as the summer heat dries up rivers and lakes so many fish died in @entity20 's @entity34 two weeks ago that the carcasses clogged an intake screen near a power plant			1
a spokesman for the coal - fired plant said workers shut down one of its two generators for several hours because of the low water levels at the lake , which it uses for cooling			1
' we 're talking hundreds of thousands ( killed ) , maybe millions by now , ' said @entity49 , a biologist with the @entity50			0
' if you 're only talking about game fish , it 's probably in the thousands			2
but for all fish , it 's probably in the millions if you look statewide			2
' ' it 's something i 've never seen in my career , and i 've been here for more than 17 years , ' said @entity62 , a biologist with the @entity63			0
' i think what we 're mainly dealing with ( is ) ... extremely low flows and this unparalleled heat			2
' indeed , it seems the fish are victims of one of the driest and warmest summers in history			2
the @entity75 @entity74 shows nearly two - thirds of the lower 48 states are experiencing some kind of drought ; while the @entity80 has labeled more than half of the nation 's counties - nearly 1,600 in 32 states - natural disaster areas			1
more than 3,000 heat records were broken over the last month			1
@entity9 officials said $ 10 million worth of sturgeon turned up dead in the @entity89 , a value partly based on their coveted eggs , used for caviar @entity63 officials said the sturgeon found dead in the @entity89 were worth nearly $ 10million , a value partly based on their highly sought eggs , which are used for caviar			1
the fish are valued at more than $ 110 a pound			1
however , @entity100 , a @entity101 spokesman , added of the sturgeon deaths that they do n't appear to have reduced the supply enough to hurt regional caviar suppliers			2
@entity62 , meanwhile , added that weekend rain improved some of @entity9 's waterways and and lakes , but temperatures were on the rise once more , straining a sturgeon population that develops health problems when water temperatures climb into the 80s			1
' those fish have been in these rivers for thousands of thousands of years , and they 're accustomed to all sorts of weather conditions , ' @entity62 said			2
' but sometimes , you have conditions occur that are outside their realm of tolerance			0
' in @entity20 , heat and lack of rain has dried up a large swath of @entity129 , the state 's largest habitat for the endangered greater redhorse , a large bottom - feeding fish			1
@entity20 biologist @entity49 said fish kills happen most summers in small private ponds and streams , but the hot weather this year has made the situation much worse			1
' this year has been really , really bad - disproportionately bad , compared to our other years , ' he said			0
about 40,000 shovelnose sturgeon were killed in @entity9 last week , while @entity12 officials said thousands of fish died in the @entity18 a stretch of @entity12 's @entity18 has dried up , killing a ' significant number ' of sturgeon , catfish , and minnows , as well as an unidentified number of endangered pallid sturgeon , said @entity150 , fisheries program manager			1
' it 's a lot of miles of river , and a lot of fish , ' @entity150 said			2
' most of those fish are barely identifiable			2
in this heat , they decay really fast			0
' @entity150 worries dry conditions in his state will continue , causing a repeat of a memorable stretch in the mid- 2000s that weakened local fish populations			0
@entity164 has also seen declining water levels that pulled younger game fish away from shore lines and forced them to cluster , making them easier targets for predators , said @entity172 , fisheries chief with the @entity173			0
@entity172 said he expects a drop in adult walleye populations in the shallower , wind - swept lakes in southern @entity164			0
but he said other species , such as large - mouth bass , can tolerate the heat and may multiply faster without competition from walleye			0
' these last two years are the hottest we 've ever seen , ' @entity172 said			0
' that really can play a role in changing populations , shifting it in favor of some species over others			0
' the walleye wo n't benefit from these high - water temperatures , but other species that are more tolerant may take advantage of their declining population			0
' @entity195 , a fisheries program administrator in @entity196 , added that there have been reports of isolated fish kills in its man - made lakes on the @entity202 and others in the eastern part of the state			0
but it 's unclear how much of a role the heat played in the gruesome fish deaths			1
one large batch of carp at @entity212 in @entity196 had lesions , a sign they were suffering from a bacterial infection			0
@entity195 said the fish are more prone to sickness with low water levels and extreme heat			1
but he added that other fish habitat have seen a record number this year , thanks to the 2011 floods			0
' when we 're in a drought , there 's a struggle for water and it 's going in all different directions , ' @entity195 said			0
' keeping it in the reservoir for recreational fisheries is not at the top of the priority list			0

more than 3,000 heat records broken across @entity75 last month
$ 10million worth of pricey sturgeon dead in @entity9
so many fish died in @entity20 lake that carcasses clogged power plant , forcing it to shut down generator
