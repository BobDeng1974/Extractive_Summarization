unhappy customer : @entity1 and @entity3 's @entity2 they ’re the promise of ‘ youth in a bottle ’ that no woman should be without			1
over the past year , you have n’t been able to open a magazine or pass a beauty counter without seeing adverts for facial serums			0
almost every cosmetics brand is doing them , from @entity16 7 to @entity17 and @entity18			2
these light , fast - absorbing creams are designed to be used as an alternative , or addition , to our usual skincare regimes			0
the theory is that because the molecules in their formulas are so much smaller than those in a moisturiser , they penetrate deeply into the skin			2
and they contain more active ingredients , vitamins and minerals than a normal face cream to help target problems such as fine lines , brown spots or oiliness			1
it ’s because they use more expensive ingredients that serums cost a lot ( you wo n’t get much change out of £ 20 for the cheapest )			1
but do they work or are they just another cosmetic company plot to part us from our hard - earned cash ? i decided to try one to find out			0
i chose the latest on the market : luxury brand @entity3 ’s @entity2			1
at £ 230 for a 30ml bottle , it ’s one of the most expensive			1
it ’s claimed to be ‘ a high - performance sculpting serum for the face and neck ’ that ‘ gives skin a tighter feeling from the first touch and helps define and reshape the look of contours , significantly transforming skin ’s appearance ’			1
the active ingredients include perennial brown algae , which has been dubbed ‘ the fountain of youth ’ , and marine peptides ( or proteins ) to ‘ enhance the look of skin ’s density and dimension ’			1
to help ascertain whether it ’s working during the recommended two months i sample it , i enlist @entity80 skin expert @entity79 to scan my face every fortnight using a @entity84 machine			1
before we start , the machine shows that for my age ( i ’m 44 ) , i have incredibly few wrinkles			0
the machine works by comparing you to 100 women of your age group			0
for wrinkles , i ’m in the best 1 per cent			0
i also do well in the pore test — mine are quite small , which means my skin looks better			2
but the machine says my face is a bit too red			0
it ’s no surprise : i ’ve always flushed easily and had pink cheeks , though i ’ve thought of myself as having an @entity99 rose complexion			2
worst , though , is the sun damage — i ’m in the bottom 11 per cent			0
while i put that down to having spent the past eight months travelling around the world in temperatures of over 100 degrees , @entity79 is n’t convinced			1
she says my type of skin , so pale i could be @entity107 or @entity108 , is more prone to sun damage than darker shades			2
@entity1 says : ' so it seems that @entity112 was right			1
the @entity2 could ' significantly transform ' skin 's appearance : except in my experience , it made it worse so , even though i never sunbathe , enough has filtered through over the years to give me @entity119 damage			1
it means that while my skin may be in good condition now , age may creep up quickly			2
that night , i put on the @entity2 for the first time , massaging in an upward motion as detailed in the instructions			1
i also press four acupressure points ( on my forehead , between my eyes , under my nose and on my chin ) for three seconds each , as the instructions tell you to			0
this is supposed to help stimulate blood flow and improve the serum ’s effectiveness			1
a few minutes after i put it on , my face begins to tingle			0
not unpleasantly , just a bit tickly			0
i ’m pleased — it means the serum is actually doing something , though a quick check in the mirror does n’t reveal a 25 - year - old staring back at me			2
by day five , i am seeing results — just not the positive ones i expected			0
my face has n’t tingled since that first night , but my chin is dry and flakey			0
the next day , my nose and cheeks start peeling and my whole face is red and patchy			0
that night , i slather on thick , unctuous @entity152 — my go - to product when my skin ’s a bit unhappy			1
after a fortnight , i return to see @entity79			1
i ’m now in the top 14 per cent of @entity160 women for wrinkles — down from the top 1 per cent			0
i ’m horrified : the last thing i want is for this serum to damage my skin and make me look older			1
' i ’m horrified : the last thing i want is for this serum to damage my skin and make me look older			1
' ‘ do n’t worry , this sometimes happens , ’ she reassures me			1
‘ things get worse before they get better			1
’ but while they might get worse , they certainly do n’t get better			1
a couple of days later my skin feels so waxy in places and dry in others it no longer feels like mine			2
by day 17 , the fine lines around my mouth are no longer fine			0
there ’s no good news from @entity79 at the halfway point nor after six weeks			1
i must admit that at this point i ’m so furious at the thought i might be damaging my skin i want to stop the experiment			2
i ca n’t wait to throw away the trendy green and silver bottle with its tiny writing that can be seen only by those young enough not to need @entity2			1
but i carry on : maybe it does take eight weeks to work			0
i ca n’t describe my relief as the trial comes to an end and i visit @entity79 in her @entity189 clinic for the last time			1
the @entity84 machine has some horrifying results for me			0
the only real improvement has been the sun damage ( i moved from the bottom 11 per cent of @entity160 women up to 29 per cent )			0
‘ this could be due to the fact there ’s not much sun around , ’ says @entity79			1
‘ and the serum may have helped			2
’ my wrinkles are n’t as good as they were eight weeks before : i ’m in the top 3 per cent , down from 1 per cent			2
@entity1 ( pictured ) tried the @entity3 serum for the recommended two months and enlisted the help of @entity80 skin expert @entity79 who scanned @entity1 's face every fortnight using a @entity84 machine and heaven knows what this serum has done to my pores because they ’ve got much , much worse			1
i was in the top 22 per cent when i started this experiment ; i ’m now in the bottom 39pc			0
but it ’s the redness that ’s the real problem			2
the day before my last @entity84 session , i was at a friend ’s when i noticed my entire face was bright red			2
not gently flushed , but pillar - box red			0
‘ the redness in your skin is much worse and due to a flare - up of rosacea , ’ says @entity79			1
‘ so the serum would probably not be something that i would recommend to sensitive skin types			1
’ not much is known about rosacea except that it ’s incurable , though pretty harmless			2
but it is embarrassing — believe me , it ’s not very nice walking around with a bright red face			0
you feel as if everyone ’s staring at you			0
@entity79 believes i ’ve had rosacea mildly for a while , but something in the serum caused it to flare - up — we do n’t know what			1
she recommends a treatment called photodynamic therapy — usually used on skin cancer sufferers — which uses laser light to help reduce the redness			0
i leave her office at my wits ’ end			0
this serum was meant to help my skin , not hurt it			2
a few weeks later , my skin is still much redder than it used to be			0
not all the time — it comes and goes			0
i have to work out what triggers it — usually such things as heat , cold or alcohol are to blame — and try to avoid them			0
in the meantime , i use thick foundation every day to try to cover it up , something i ’ve never had to do before			0
so it seems that @entity112 was right			0
the @entity2 could ‘ significantly transform ’ skin ’s appearance : except in my experience , it made it worse			1
and to think that they charge £ 230 for it .			1

luxury brand @entity3 ’s @entity2 is £ 230 for 30ml
ingredients include perennial brown algae ( dubbed ‘ the fountain of youth ’ )
@entity1 tried the serum for the recommended two months
