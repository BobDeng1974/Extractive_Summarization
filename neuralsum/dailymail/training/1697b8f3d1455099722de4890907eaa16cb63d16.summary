' his no - holds - barred assessment of the @entity5 administration came in a new excerpt released today from a forthcoming book about the cable news mogul , @entity1 : @entity15 , by @entity16			1
it 's a well known fact that there is no love lost between @entity2 and the left but @entity22 ' piece portrays a side of @entity1 that is rarely seen , the man as a father , husband and a human who lives with a very real sense of his own mortality			1
a man and his empire : @entity1 founded the @entity2 in 1996 and it has grown to become the most watched cable news network mr @entity1 delivered his scathing criticism of mr @entity5 during the 2012 presidential election in response to the comments made by @entity38 strategist @entity37 , who said @entity39 had ' never worked a day in her life			1
