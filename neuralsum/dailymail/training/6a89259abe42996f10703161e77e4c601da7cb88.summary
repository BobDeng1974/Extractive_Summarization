researchers have identified the voice of @entity2 for the first time in some of the earliest audio recordings ever created			1
the @entity5 discovered the recording on a wax disc from 1885 , which had been donated to the @entity9			1
recent technological advances have allowed the recordings to be played for the first time in over 100 years			1
scroll down to hear the recording the phonorecord by @entity2 which contains the only known recording of his voice			2
the @entity5 identified the recording with help from technicians at the @entity20 and the @entity21 in @entity22 best known for the first practical telephone , @entity2 was born in @entity24 and was an eminent scientist , inventor , engineer and innovator			2
both his mother and wife were deaf , profoundly influencing @entity2 's life 's work into hearing devices , and he was awarded the first @entity35 patent for the telephone in 1876			1
however , @entity2 considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study			2
he went on to carry out groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications , hydrofoils and aeronautics , and in 1888 , @entity2 became one of the founding members of the @entity49			2
technicians at the @entity20 and the @entity21 in @entity22 worked with the museum , which holds some of the earliest audio recordings ever made			1
researchers found a transcript of one recording signed by @entity2			2
it was matched to a wax disc recording from april 15 , 1885			2
' hear my voice , @entity2 , ' the inventor is heard to say			2
the experimental recording also includes a series of numbers			0
the transcript notes the record was made at @entity2 's @entity66 in @entity67			1
other recordings from the time include lines from @entity71			2
in late 2011 , scientists played back some of @entity2 's earliest recordings for the first time with new technology that reads the sound digitally from tiny grooves in the wax disc using light and a 3d camera			1
the breakthrough offered a glimpse at the experiments with sound and recording at the dawn of the information age when inventors were scrambling to secure patents for the first telephones and phonographs			0
the recordings were packed away for more than 100 years and were deemed obsolete until new technology allowed them to be replayed			1
' identifying the voice of @entity2 , the man who brought us everyone else 's voice , is a major moment in the study of history , ' said @entity101 , director of the @entity9 's @entity35 history museum , in announcing the find			1
' it enriches what we know about the late 1800s - who spoke , what they said and how they said it			0
' in autumn 2011 , @entity112 , an @entity113 sound - media historian , compiled an exhaustive inventory of notations on the discs and cylinders - many scratched on wax and all but illegible			0
a closeup of the recording that revealed @entity2 's voice for the first time the grooves that identified @entity2 : modern technology allowed the wax disc to be replayed for the first time in over 100 years documents indicated that one wax - and - cardboard disc , from april 15 , 1885 , a date now deciphered from a wax inscription , contained a recording of @entity2 speaking			1
on june 20 , 2012 , at the @entity20 , a team heard the recording for the first time this century			0
from the 1880s on , until his death in 1922 , @entity2 gave an extensive collection of laboratory materials to the @entity9 , where he was a member of the @entity139			1
the donation included more than 400 discs and cylinders @entity2 used as he tried his hand at recording sound			0
the holdings also documented @entity2 ’s research , should patent disputes arise similar to the protracted legal wrangling that attended the invention of the telephone			0
the museum also identified the voice of @entity153 , the famous inventor 's father , in an 1881 recording			0
@entity2 deposited this recording and his recording machine at the @entity9 in 1881 in case of a patent dispute			1
he conducted his sound experiments between 1880 and 1886 , collaborating with his cousin @entity161 and technician @entity162			0
they worked at @entity2 ’s @entity66 , at 1221 @entity164 in @entity67 , originally established inside what had been a stable			1
in 1877 , his great rival , @entity166 , had recorded sound on embossed foil ; @entity2 was eager to improve the process			0
some of @entity2 ’s research on light and sound during this period anticipated fiber - optic communications			0
@entity2 on the telephone in @entity175 ( calling @entity176 ) in 1892 @entity2 had long been fascinated by the idea of transmitting speech as oth his mother and wife were deaf , profoundly influencing @entity2 's life 's work into hearing devices			1
by 1875 he had come up with a simple receiver that could turn electricity into sound			0
others were working along the same lines , including an @entity190 @entity189 , and debate continues as to who should be credited with inventing the telephone			0
however , @entity2 was granted a patent for the first telephone on 7 march 1876 and it developed quickly			0
within a year the first telephone exchange was built in @entity164 and the @entity197 was created in 1877 , with @entity2 the owner of a third of the shares , quickly making him a wealthy man .			0

disc was discovered among audio recordings held at the @entity9
record was made at @entity2 's @entity66 in @entity67 in 1885
3d scans of disc allowed it to be heard for the first time in over 100 years
