by @entity0 it was once assumed that a young couple would get married and start a family as soon as they could			2
today they are more likely to live together to see if they ’re truly compatible before they consider tying the knot			0
however , a social scientist is now saying that getting married earlier actually makes a stronger partnership			0
in his new book , @entity13 's guide to getting ahead , @entity11 says those who get married in their twenties have a stronger partnership than those who marry later in life @entity11 believes young people should be more open to what he calls a ‘ startup marriage ’ in their 20s , rather than waiting for a ‘ merger marriage ’ in their 30s			1
in his new book , @entity13 ’s guide to getting ahead , he describes startup marriages as those in which the couple generally meet at university , or at the start of their careers , when they have little money and personal success is not yet assured			1
he claims they can make you happier than today ’s popular ‘ mergers ’ , where the pair meet and settle down later , when they are already doing well in their jobs and have achieved some level of success on their own			1
dr @entity11 claims startups are more likely to achieve a ‘ certain kind of symbiosis , where two people become more than the sum of the individuals ’			1
his advice on marrying young echoes that of author @entity54 , whose latest book , @entity56 , has provoked uproar by urging women to find a husband while at university			1
dr @entity11 , an @entity63 whose 1994 bestseller , @entity61 , sparked controversy for its analysis of iq and class , compares the benefits of a start - up marriage with the early days of computer giant @entity70			1
‘ for one thing , you will both have memories of your life together when it was still up in the air , ’ he said			2
@entity11 believes young people should be more open to what he calls a ' startup marriage ' in their 20s , rather than waiting for a ' merger marriage ' in their 30s ‘ i ’m willing to bet that @entity84 ’s fondest memories are of the years when @entity70 went from being a couple of college dropouts in makeshift offices to a player in the new world of information technology , not of the year in which he became the richest man in the world			1
‘ the same applies to startup marriages			2
you ’ll have fun remembering the years when you went from being scared newcomers to the point at which you realised you were going to make it			1
‘ even more important , you and your spouse will have made your way together			0
whatever happens , you will have shared the experience			0
’ merger marriages do have their advantages , said dr @entity11 , including fewer financial pressures and a lesser likelihood of spouses outgrowing each other as identities are ‘ well formed ’ by the time they meet			1
but startups can be special because ‘ you will each know that you would n’t have become the person you are without each other ’			0
dr @entity11 said that people who marry later can still acquire the benefits of a startup marriage by making a major change to their lives , such as changing jobs			1
he said : ‘ i was 40 when my wife and i married , but in practice we had a startup marriage			1
i had quit my secure job working at a social science research organisation and struck out into the unknown a year before we married			0
‘ everything that has happened in my career since then – including all my major books – has happened together			0
’ he believes there can be good reasons for delaying marriage , but that some of the reasons are part of the ‘ @entity138 syndrome ’			2
‘ not wanting to acknowledge that one is now a grown - up and it ’s time to leave childish things behind			0
this is especially true of guys			0
' you ’ll have fun remembering the years when you went from being scared newcomers to the point at which you realised you were going to make it ' ‘ historically , a significant reason men married was to get regular sexual access to a woman			2
now , they say to themselves , why bother ? until they get old enough to realise that they ’re missing out on something , which often takes a long time			0
’ however , his advice is the opposite to what most modern couples do			2
according to the latest numbers from the @entity162 , there were 247,890 marriages in @entity164 and @entity165 in 2011 , with the average ages of a first - time bride and groom being 30.2 and 32.2			0
the figures contrast sharply with those of 1981 , when there were 351,973 and the average ages of a bride and groom were 23.1 and 25.4 .			0

@entity11 believes young people should be open to ' startup marriage '
he describes type of marriage as those who meet in early years of career
claims they make couples happier than those who meet later in their life
