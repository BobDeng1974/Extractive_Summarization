an airline passenger was thrown off a flight after a fellow traveller reported him to cabin crew for writing the word ' terrorism ' in his journal as they prepared to take off			1
@entity8 was on a @entity11 - bound @entity10 flight from @entity12 when a man in the seat behind him complained to a stewardess			1
about 10 minutes later @entity17 federal police officers boarded the flight and asked him to get off			1
the drama was sparked when the 28 - year - old scribbled a drawing of a distressed man and wrote the words ' terror is made up '			1
above his drawing , he had also written : ' in a land of melting ice creams , sandy feet and fluffy bears , how can anyone be fearful of terrorism			0
' ' i 'm an inquisitive guy and i was just making light - hearted scribble about how everyone is getting so scared about terrorism again , ' mr @entity8 told @entity50			2
' then i heard the guy behind me tap the stewardess and say " look what he 's writing "			0
' so i turned around and told him that i was merely commenting on the mass fear of the @entity17 people			0
' shortly after , he looked up only to be faced with three officers from the @entity60 who ordered him to alight from the aircraft			2
' it was an incredibly unjust situation , ' mr @entity8 said			0
' i was afraid because no one was helping me and i was blamed purely from hearsay			0
' nobody defended me on the plane as i looked around for sympathy			0
' i guess they thought " there goes the baddie and pointed their finger at me "			0
@entity8 was on a @entity11 - bound @entity10 flight from @entity12 on saturday morning and was not charged by police but mr @entity8 did n't leave without a fight			1
as he was escorted off the plane , he tried to plead his innocence to the rest of the passengers on board by yelling : ' i 'm not a criminal you 've got the wrong guy '			0
once he was taken off the flight , police searched mr @entity8 and agreed that he was indeed innocent			1
' the police said i was free to go because i did nothing wrong but no further action was taken , ' he said			0
' when i asked them about a reimbursement for another flight , the police said it was matter for the airline			1
' so after five hours worth of phone calls , an operator from @entity98 - owned @entity10 informed mr @entity8 that he had to submit an online form in order to gain a response regarding the matter			1
' and to add salt to the wound , i was told that they [ @entity10 ] ca n't guarantee that i 'll be able to get on another flight because i might be blacklisted , ' he said			2
@entity10 has confirmed it sought an @entity60 intervention after receiving a complaint about a disruptive passenger			1
the airline had a policy of zero - tolerance in matters of safety , it also said in a statement			1
' safety and security of staff and passengers underpins the operation at all times and is never compromised , ' a @entity10 spokesperson said			1
' as per @entity10 's conditions of carriage , the airline may refuse passengers to travel for reasons of safety or security and this may include the enforcement of future travel bans			2
' as the matter was dealt with by the @entity60 and is subject to further review by @entity10 , we are unable to comment further at this time			1
' an operator from @entity10 told mr @entity8 that he may be ' blacklisted ' from future flights however a spokesman for @entity60 said ' no further action will be taken '			1
' the @entity60 responded to a call for assistance from the airline and briefly spoke to the individual concerned , ' the spokesman said			2
' it is a matter for the airline			0
' still , mr @entity8 has received no word from @entity10 as concerns grow for both him and his family			2
' my biggest fear is this will cause a ripple effect with other airlines and now my family is paranoid that they 'll be blacklisted too , ' he said			0
' especially because we have a particular surname â€“ there are n't a lot of @entity157 out there			0
' the pure irony of it all was that i was writing about the very subject of this fear in everyone about terror			0
so the whole situation is quite poignant and ridiculous			0
' the incident comes in light of the federal government 's bid to step up security measures after increasing @entity17 's terrorism alert level to high			2
on thursday , at least 800 officers from @entity60 and @entity173 were involved in anti-terror raids across @entity175 and @entity176 , which has been declared as @entity17 's largest ever counter-terrorism operation			1
those who were arrested include @entity178 , who was charged with a serious terrorism related offence for allegedly plotting to behead a member of the public in @entity182 , @entity175 's @entity183 .			0
