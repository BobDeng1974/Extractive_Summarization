all this after just two wins in their previous 24 games			2
most looking at the club reasoned relegation would be a matter of time			0

@entity62 will surely be named @entity2 ’s player of the season come what may			1
the @entity68 has sprinkled high quality to their midfield , winning possession and conducting play like a grand master plots chess moves			0
at 34 , his experience is now shining through – a calm head even as circumstances appeared brittle			0
his goal to set up the win over @entity80 was special too			0
his pass completion was not outstanding against @entity5 – just 68.3 per cent – but that is largely because he tried difficult balls to get his team on the front foot			2
@entity2 midfielder @entity62 puts in another classy performance against @entity5 on saturday @entity87 sensational with the score at 1 - 0 , @entity5 unlocked the @entity2 defence to send @entity90 through on goal			1
@entity87 was out in a flash , spreading himself large and deflecting the finish wide			2
it was a hugely important moment			0
the @entity96 goalkeeper was on the sidelines with a broken metatarsal for more than three months of this season , but has returned at peak form for this crucial period			1
foxes goalkeeper @entity87 gets down quickly and makes himself big to save from @entity102 adept at adapting aside from @entity87 ’s injury , @entity10 has been able to call a mainly full - strength squad most weeks			1
he has changed personnel – only @entity106 has more than 30 starts under his belt – and players appear fresh when other squads may be tiring			0
he is flexible with his tactics , changing during games to suit the situation			0
he is getting it right recently			0
against @entity115 he began with 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 but switched to 3 - 5 - 2 when trailing at half - time			2

@entity41 slides in with a strong challenge on @entity5 's @entity118 during the @entity6 match on saturday @entity10 ’s strength the @entity2 manager has been on the touchline rather than high in the stands recently , and uses his position to effect rather than for show			1
he kept players motivated at the @entity127 and used a break in play against @entity5 to give an impromptu team talk			2
he has been in remarkable survivals before , at @entity132 , @entity133 , and @entity115 , and knows what is required			0
he has managed to keep the respect of the squad through his imposing personality even after the phantom sacking			0
the players have always supported him			0
@entity2 boss @entity10 gives instructions to his players ahead of the 2 - 0 win over @entity5 belief building the great escape theme was hummed loudly by @entity2 fans at fullt - time , and atmospheres at the @entity60 have been very noisy for the wins over @entity80 and @entity5			1
that will continue for four of the final six games , with home comfort looking vital			0
@entity21 at @entity151 awaits first , and @entity36 , who scored the opening goal , insists @entity2 must not let their intensity dip			2
he also thinks @entity2 ’s sustained spell in the relegation zone has equipped them with the psychological tools to claw their way up			1
‘ if you know this situation at the bottom you play different , the mentality is a little different , ’ he said			0
‘ now with a good result and we have to push on			0
’ a @entity2 fan holds up a sign backing the team to win their battle against relegation this season			1
