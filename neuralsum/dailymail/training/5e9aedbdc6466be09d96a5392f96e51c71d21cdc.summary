the 46 - year - old presenter , who admitted last week that she was terrified about the prospect of the swim , was seen having to be dragged out of the water after finishing the stretch			1
but as she embarked on the next section of her 500 - mile journey from @entity17 to @entity18 - a 65 - mile bike ride to monday 's finishing point in @entity21 dismissed concerns about her health with a positive message to her supporters			1
' i 'm fine ' : @entity3 reassured fans that she 'll continue with her @entity6 triathlon as she embarked on a 65 - mile cycle ride on monday she told the crowds waiting to see her off as she embarked on the next leg of her journey : ' i ’m completely fine , i was just cold ! i ’ve warmed up now , i ’ve had a nice bath and i ’m ready to get on the bike			1
' as well as a bath , @entity35 was seen indulging in a burger and chips for a much - needed calorie and energy boost			1
and the mother - of - three certainly looked in better spirits as she tucked in - a sharp contrast to her worrying appearance after the @entity9 swim just hours earlier			1
cheering her on : supporters flocked around @entity35 to give her some encouragement ahead of the next leg of her journey pedal power : @entity35 looked determined as she put her game face on contrast : @entity35 's determination and good spirits were in sharp contrast to earlier in the day , when she was seen being dragged out of @entity9 following a 1.5 mile swim after reaching the finish point , @entity35 was seen clinging to the support kayak for dear life as she was taken over to the dock			1
but once on solid ground , @entity35 struggled to stand , and had to be carried by a member of the crew			0
as she was rushed up to the hotel , @entity35 could n't even open her eyes , and appeared beyond exhausted			0
pictures of @entity35 later posted on the @entity67 showed the presenter wrapped up in blankets as the medical team battled to raise her core body temperature			2
tucking in : @entity35 was seen enjoying a spot of the winter olympics and chowing down on a burger and chips before starting the bike ride at last ... a smile ! @entity35 appeared cheery as she cycled along the tarmac dig in ! @entity35 was able to enjoy the scenery as she pedalled along speaking after the swim , @entity35 said : ' the moment i got in the water my chest felt crushed - i could n’t do front crawl , i could n’t put my head under water , i could n’t breathe			1
one thing @entity89 told me that was pulling me through was to think of the building ahead of us as a magnet , drawing us towards it			0
when i was near the end and really struggling , i got so desperate i looked up to @entity98 – if there was anyone up there i needed their help ! ' i kept trying to lift my arm to swim , trying to pull the crawl out of the bag , but i could n’t even get it up			2
i ended up doing doggy paddle ! i imagined my sister holding me and pulling me through it			0
it was such a struggle , but i have such a great team around me , i could n’t have done it without them			0
although i ’m shattered i never felt unsafe , i ’m in the best possible hands			0
' and @entity35 's trainer added : ' i was in the water throughout the whole swim to ensure @entity35 ’s safety			1
it was very tough and very cold , but i can reassure people that she was safe throughout and never in any real danger			2
i ’m full of admiration for her determination to finish this swim and get back on her bike			1
' helping hand : @entity35 had to be hauled out of the water by the crew after the gruelling swim completely drained : questions are sure to arise as to whether @entity35 will be able to complete the rest of the challenge , which concludes on friday struggling to finish : the pain on @entity35 's face was clear to see as she finished the one - mile swim holding on for dear life : @entity35 was seen clinging onto the boat as she got back to the dock fears over @entity35 's heath certainly were n't unwarranted , however , as it was revealed over the weekend that she was undergoing medical tests due to concerns that she may be suffering from hypothermia			1

in previous years @entity163 picked up bugs during swimming down the @entity165 , as well as developing sores from his wetsuit , and two years ago @entity168 was left in agony amid worries about stress fractures as he did back - to - back marathon distances while travelling from @entity173 to @entity18			2
prior to embarking on the swim , @entity35 's fear was clear to see , with a video of the mother - of - three showing her breaking down in tears as she prepared for the task ahead			1
wrapped up : the team 's main concern was raising @entity35 's core body temperature after she was brought in from the cold trying to warm up : @entity35 looked entirely exhausted as she sat in bed covered in blankets that 's better : as @entity35 was given a hot chocolate , she finally managed a small smile wearing a black wetsuit , @entity35 attempted to hold back the sobs as she coaxed herself into the water , telling her trainer , professor @entity191 : ' i 'm gon na be ok '			0

' and then : ' she 's stopped			0
