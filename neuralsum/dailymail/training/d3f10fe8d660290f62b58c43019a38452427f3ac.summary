by @entity0 researchers have uncovered a bizarre new type of ' upside down ' sea creature they claim could give an insight into life on one of @entity8 's icy moons			1
the @entity10 team from the @entity11 , used a camera - equipped robot to survey the area under @entity16 's @entity15			1
they found a new species of small sea anemones that were burrowed into the ice , their tentacles protruding into frigid water like flowers from a ceiling			1
researchers say researchers say it could hint at what life on @entity8 's moon is like			1
though other sea anemones have been found in @entity16 , the newly discovered species is the first reported to live in ice			1
the anemones themselves measured less than an inch long in their contracted state -- though they get three to four times longer in their relaxed state			0
each features 20 to 24 tentacles , an inner ring of eight longer tentacles and an outer ring of 12 to 16 tentacles			0
they also live upside down , hanging from the ice , compared to other sea anemones that live on or in the seafloor			1
in addition to the anemones , the scientists saw fish who routinely swam upside down , the ice shelf serving as the floor of their submarine world , as well as polychaete worms , amphipods and a bizarre little creature they dubbed ' the eggroll ' , a four - inch - long , one - inch - diameter , neutrally - buoyant cylinder , that seemed to swim using appendages at both ends of its body , which was observed bumping along the field of sea anemones under the ice and hanging on to them at times			1
' the pictures blew my mind , it was really an amazing find , ' said @entity82 , a specialist in sea anemones at @entity84 , who studied the specimens retrieved by scientists and engineers with the @entity10 - funded @entity88 ( @entity89 ) program 's @entity91 project			1
the team made the astonishing discovery of thousands upon thousands of the small anemones			2
@entity96 is helping to finance the development of the new underwater robot because the @entity16 discoveries have implications for the possibility of life that may exist on @entity103 , the ice - covered moon of @entity8			1
the new species , discovered in late december 2010 , was publicly identified for the first time in an article published last month in @entity109 , an open - access , peer - reviewed journal published by the @entity112			2
though other sea anemones have been found in @entity16 , the newly discovered species is the first reported to live in ice			1
they also live upside down , hanging from the ice , compared to other sea anemones that live on or in the seafloor			1
the white anemones have been named @entity29 , in honor of the @entity122			0
the remotely operated vehicle , known as @entity124 ( @entity125 of under @entity126 ) , that made the discovery of the new sea anemone species			2
@entity129 , who heads the @entity130 in @entity10 's @entity131 , noted that the discovery indicates how much remains both unknown and unexplored by scientists , even after more than 50 years of active @entity135 research on the @entity137 continent ' it is an absolutely astonishing discovery -- and just how the sea anemones create and maintain burrows in the bottom of the ice shelf , while that surface is actively melting , remains an intriguing mystery , " he said			1
' this goes to show how much more we have to learn about the @entity16 and how life there has adapted			2
' @entity10 is responsible for managing all scientific research and logistics of the @entity152 on the @entity16 continent and in the @entity154			2
the discovery was ' total serendipity , ' said @entity157 , executive director of the @entity158 at the @entity11			0
' when we looked up at the bottom of the ice shelf , there they were			0
' scientists had lowered the robot -- a 4.5 - foot cylinder equipped with two cameras , a side - mounted lateral camera and a forward - looking camera with a fish - eye lens -- into a hole bored through the 270 - meter - thick shelf of ice that extends over 600 miles northward from the grounding zone of the @entity174 into the @entity175			1
' people were literally jumping up and down with excitement , ' @entity157 said			0
' they had found a whole new ecosystem that no one had ever seen before			0
' what started out as an engineering test of the remotely operated vehicle during its first deployment through a thick ice shelf turned into a significant and exciting biological discovery , ' he said			0
this is an artist 's concept of a plume of water vapor thought to be ejected off the frigid , icy surface of the @entity192 , located about 500 million miles ( 800 million kilometers ) from the sun. plumes of water vapour 100 miles high may have been spotted bursting out of the icy surface of @entity8 's @entity103 , raising hopes it may harbour life			1
scientists believe they detected two vapour jets shooting into space for seven hours at a time			0
@entity192 's vapour fountains are thought to reach heights of 124 miles - around 20 times higher than the peak of @entity207			2
if confirmed , the observations prove that water from the moon 's ice - covered ocean can easily reach the surface , which has important implications for future space missions			2
many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding @entity192 , warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by @entity8 's gravity , may have conditions favourable to life			1
scientists used images from the @entity223 to identify unusual ' spikes ' of hydrogen and oxygen in two distinct regions of the moon 's southern @entity228 were observed for just seven hours at a time when @entity231 was at the furthest point of its orbit away from @entity8 , vanishing as the moon got closer			2
in addition to the anemones , the scientists saw fish who routinely swam upside down , the ice shelf serving as the floor of their submarine world , as well as polychaete worms , amphipods and a bizarre little creature they dubbed ' the eggroll ' , a four - inch - long , one - inch - diameter , neutrally - buoyant cylinder , that seemed to swim using appendages at both ends of its body , which was observed bumping along the field of sea anemones under the ice and hanging on to them at times			1
the anemones themselves measured less than an inch long in their contracted state -- though they get three to four times longer in their relaxed state , @entity82 said			0
each features 20 to 24 tentacles , an inner ring of eight longer tentacles and an outer ring of 12 to 16 tentacles			0
after using hot water to stun the creatures , the team used an improvised suction device to retrieve the animals from their burrows			0
they were then transported to @entity276 for preservation and further study			0
because the team was n't hunting for biological discoveries , they were not equipped with the proper supplies to preserve the specimens for dna / rna analyses , @entity157 said			0
@entity8 's icy moon europa is slightly smaller than the @entity286 's @entity285			1
@entity192 orbits @entity8 every 3.5 days and is phase locked -- just like @entity288 -- so that the same side of @entity103 faces @entity8 at all times			2
however , because @entity192 orbits in an oval , when it is close to @entity8 the tide is much higher			2
it is thought to have an iron core , a rocky mantle and a surface ocean of salty water , like @entity286			0
unlike on @entity286 , however , this ocean is deep enough to cover the whole surface of @entity192 , and being far from the sun , the ocean surface is globally frozen over			0
many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding @entity192 , warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by @entity8 's gravity , may have conditions favourable to life			1
the specimens were placed in ethanol at the drilling site and some were later preserved in formalin at @entity276			0
many mysteries remain about the creatures , the scientists report			0
though some sea anemones burrow into sand by using their tentacles or by expanding and deflating the base of their body , those strategies do n't seem feasible for hard ice			2
it is also unclear how they survive without freezing and how they reproduce			0
there is no evidence of what they eat , although they likely feed on plankton in the water flowing beneath the ice shelf , @entity82 said			0
@entity157 said a proposal is being prepared for further study of this unusual environment , using a robot capable of exploring deeper in the ocean and further from the access hole through the ice			0
@entity96 is helping to finance the development of the new underwater robot because the @entity16 discoveries have implications for the possibility of life that may exist on @entity103 , the ice - covered moon of @entity8			1
he said researchers hope to return to @entity16 as early as 2015 to continue studying the sea anemones and other organisms beneath the ice shelf .			1
