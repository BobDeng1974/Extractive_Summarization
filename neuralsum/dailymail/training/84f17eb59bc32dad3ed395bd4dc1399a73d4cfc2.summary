by @entity0 for @entity1 a couple definitely managed to leave their mark on each other when they got married at a tattoo convention and were inked with each others ' initials instead of exchanging rings			1
@entity10 , 25 , had been looking forward to a traditional white wedding when she arrived to tie the knot with @entity13 , 29 , at @entity14 in @entity15			1
but instead of the intimate ceremony and beautiful castle setting she had hoped for , the council worker was met with a hall crammed with 10,000 ink - loving strangers			2
wedding bells : @entity10 , 25 , and @entity13 , 29 , married at a tattoo convention in front of 10,000 strangers @entity13 had been tasked with arranging the surprise ceremony as part of a tv reality show but decided to hold the entire thing at the tattoo convention in @entity15			1
the wedding venue should n't have come as a complete shock for the bride , as the fun loving couple from @entity35 , @entity36 , are mad about tattoos and even have matching ones			1
' i have 22 tattoos in total including a portrait of @entity43 and @entity10 has around 11 , ' revealed bar manager @entity13			1
' i have a king of hearts suit on my finger and @entity10 has the queen on hers			0
' because of our love of tattoos , i thought the convention would be ideal for us			0
but it was n't just the event that i was sold on : the venue and it 's grounds are stunning and i was blown away by it			0
' it was hard to carry the tattoo theme throughout the day , especially at the reception , but i think i managed to pull it off			0
' romantic : @entity13 was in charge of arranging the wedding and opted for a convention instead of a castle happy : the pair cut their cake which , like the rest of the wedding , also had a colourful body art theme instead of exchanging rings at the altar , @entity13 arranged for a tattoo artist to ink the first letter of their names on each others ' wedding ring finger			1
even though the bride spent most of the day travelling from @entity36 to @entity15 in a minibus , that did n't stop @entity13 from giving @entity10 her special day			1
@entity10 admitted that although her original thoughts were ' i ca n't believe this is happening ' , she thoroughly enjoyed her unusual wedding			1
' my dream was to get married in a stately home with the ceremony or reception taking place outside , but on the day all i could think about was @entity13			2
' the most important part for me was to have my whole family at the wedding and for my father to walk me down the aisle			0
' he done well choosing my dress , but the worst part was not having any contact or any say in the plans			0
' who are you ? along with family members and friends , the guest list included everyone at the convention at least she said i do ! @entity10 smiles as she and @entity13 exchange vows in front of 10,000 strangers romantic : the couple have new tattoos added to their fingers in place of a more traditional ring the newlywed 's story appeared in @entity119 , which sees men organise their weddings behind their partners ' backs			1
producers give the groom Â£ 12,000 to plan a wedding in just three weeks - but allow him no contact with his fiancee			0
as a result , the weddings can be unusual , with @entity13 admitting that giving him the reins was particularly risky because , he says , he is ' lazy ' and never does anything around the house			0
' i wanted to show @entity10 that i could do it and that i do n't always leave everything to the last minute , ' he added			2
all done : the couple show off their new tattoos following the ceremony at a body art convention in @entity15 speaking about his unusual choice of venue , he said : ' we love to mess around and do silly things and i 'd say our shared love of tattoos are just an added bonus to us as a couple			2
' we both knew that we wanted to get married and we never wanted a long term engagement so it worked perfectly			0
' it was incredible when the @entity158 song , @entity156 started and my wife made her entrance - i got goosebumps			0

@entity10 , 25 , married @entity13 , 29 , in front of 10,000 strangers
@entity13 arranged the unusual ceremony for show do n't tell the bride
instead of wedding rings , the couple had tattoos inked on their fingers
