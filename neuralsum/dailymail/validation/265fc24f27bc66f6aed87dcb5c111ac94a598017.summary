@entity0 insists @entity1 are capable of overtaking bitter rivals @entity2 and finishing second in the league			1
@entity1 put on their best display of the season on sunday as they swept aside @entity6 in a near - effortless 3 - 0 victory at @entity8			1
the impressive performance raised hopes and expectation levels at the club and @entity0 thinks @entity1 are well - equipped to sustain that kind of performance level for the rest of the season			1
@entity0 , pictured tussling with @entity6 's @entity16 , believes @entity1 can finish second @entity17 scores @entity1 's third goal in their comfortable 3 - 0 win against @entity6 on sunday @entity1 are two points behind @entity2 , who lost to @entity22 on saturday , and just one point adrift of third - placed @entity24			1
and @entity0 is convinced finishing second above @entity2 is not just a pipe dream			1
' yes , i think we could , especially after @entity2 's result on saturday , ' the @entity1 defender said			1
' it is all very close			0
' i think it 's very open all the way up to second place and we will be aiming for that , especially when we are playing those teams coming up			0
' we want @entity37 football back here			1
@entity39 is the minimum but when it 's there , second is a realistic target and if we keep on performing like that i do n't see why we ca n't give it a good push			2
' @entity1 face @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity2 and @entity49 over the next four weeks and then host @entity24 on the penultimate weekend			2

' a video released by @entity85 on sunday , appearing to show @entity17 being knocked out by @entity87 defender @entity86 , dominated the build - up to the match			0
but @entity17 poked fun at the episode by shadow boxing during his celebration for his goal at @entity8			2
@entity17 celebrates his goal against @entity6 by mocking a video of him being knocked out by @entity86 it was not the first time @entity17 has been at the centre of controversy during his career and it was interesting on monday that he picked out another player who had a rollercoaster career - @entity109 - as his favourite @entity111 footballer during a @entity112			0
