@entity0 , pictured here with his wife @entity2 , has been challenged by @entity3 to prove that he did not try to avoid tax in relation to his property dealings @entity0 faced calls last night to publish full details of his tax affairs			1
the @entity11 ’s family affairs have come under the spotlight after he spent much of last week condemning ‘ tax dodgers ’			2
the @entity14 told yesterday how he and his family used a ‘ deed of variation ’ to divide ownership of their family home – which experts say is used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills			2
it has now emerged that mr @entity0 and his partner @entity24 – his wife since 2011 – both sold separate flats they owned in upmarket @entity27 in 2008 and 2009 without paying capital gains tax			1
mr @entity0 sold his £ 740,000 apartment five months after the purchase of their family home for £ 1.6million and six months after the couple had their first son			1
but he claimed that the flat was his ‘ primary residence ’			0
saying the flats were their primary homes enabled them both to save tens of thousands of pounds in capital gains tax			1
@entity11 yesterday insisted any suggestion of tax avoidance is a ‘ straightforward lie ’			0
and today mr @entity0 is expected to say he is ‘ not backing down ’ in his campaign against tax avoidance , despite the controversy about his own affairs			1
in a speech to the @entity11 conference he will accuse ministers of ‘ turning a blind eye ’ to tax avoidance			0
but the @entity52 last night stepped up pressure on him to publish the details of his tax affairs			0
mr @entity0 managed to avoid paying capital gains tax on the sale of the flat he owned before moving into the townhouse where his family now live			1
mr @entity0 met miss @entity24 in 2002			1
in the following years , they owned separate flats			2
he originally had an apartment on @entity64 but sold this for £ 342,000 in 2005 , before buying a flat on nearby @entity67 about a year later for £ 648,500			2
it is not known where mr @entity0 , then 36 , lived in the intervening months			1
but miss @entity24 owned a flat in @entity70			0
this was sold for £ 680,000 in march 2008 , with miss @entity24 paying no capital gains tax			1
a @entity11 spokesman has said this is because it was her primary residence			0
yet when mr @entity0 sold his flat on @entity67 for £ 740,000 in december 2009 , he did not pay capital gains tax either , as he claimed this was his primary residence			1
this is despite the fact that five months earlier miss @entity24 – an environmental law expert on around £ 200,000 a year – had bought for £ 1.6 million the family home near @entity84 where they now live			1
she had also given birth to their first son @entity87 earlier that year , in june 2009			0
they were able to avoid the tax in part because they were unmarried			0
mr @entity0 and miss @entity24 became engaged in 2010 and married a year later			1
miss @entity24 , however , is still registered as the sole owner of their four - bedroom @entity95 property for reasons that are unclear			0
@entity52 mp @entity99 said mr @entity0 ’s family ’s deed of variation was clearly designed to cut inheritance tax and condemned the @entity11 ’s denial of this			1
he added : ‘ @entity0 should now publish this deed of variation that he is currently hiding away and be as open about his own tax affairs as he demands others to be			2
the public can then judge for themselves			0
’ the former @entity111 sir @entity112 , now a @entity11 parliamentary candidate , added : ‘ people will take different views on deeds of variation and all forms of tax relief is , in one sense , intended to reduce tax			0
people have a strong feeling that sophisticated tax avoidance is morally wrong			0
’ @entity3 want to know if mr @entity0 and his family used tax avoidance strategies when trading houses mr @entity0 has spent the week lambasting tax dodgers in the wake of allegations that @entity132 ’s @entity131 private bank helped clients evade tax			1
he had gone on the attack over allegations of tax avoidance activities linked to some wealthy supporters of the @entity52 , telling the @entity139 that @entity140 was ‘ a dodgy prime minister surrounded by dodgy donors ’			0
mr @entity0 was subsequently forced to defend his own tax affairs			1
asked by @entity144 political editor @entity143 if he thought it was ‘ dodgy ’ to use a deed of variation and leave your house to your children to avoid tax , the @entity11 leader said : ‘ the deed of variation ... is something my mother did 20 years ago			0
i paid tax as a result of that transaction , i ’ve avoided no tax in that			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s father ’s will was changed by deed of variation after his death in 1994 so @entity0 , @entity140 and their mother @entity165 all became part - owners of their £ 2.4million family home			1
this meant that if she then died , the sons would already own part of the property so inheritance tax would be applicable to less of the home than were she to have owned it outright			2
mr @entity0 has , however , since sold his share to his brother , who bought the remainder from his mother , who is still alive			1
he also claims to have paid capital gains tax at 40 per cent on the sale and denied he used the arrangement to avoid tax			1
a spokesman said : ‘ it ca n’t be tax avoidance if no tax was avoided			0
’ last night a spokesman for mr @entity0 insisted the couple only moved in together in 2008 – six years into their relationship and when mr @entity0 was 38 and miss @entity24 37			1
‘ as @entity197 guidance makes clear , primary residence relief continues for three years after you leave your home			0
the final 36 months of ownership always qualify for relief as long as the dwelling house has been your only or main residence at some point			0
’ by @entity206 , @entity207 why did the family change @entity210 ’s will ? changing someone ’s will using a deed of variation is a relatively rare event and requires the agreement of all the beneficiaries – so why did the @entity0 family do it ? was it because their father had forgotten something , or was it simply for tax planning reasons ? if mrs @entity225 wanted to give some of the house to her sons she could have done that without changing her husband ’s will – but this would have given her a tax liability when she continued living in the property			1
by altering the will and essentially making @entity210 give a share of the house to his sons as a gift , mrs @entity225 was allowed to remain living there tax free			0
it also meant that when @entity0 and @entity140 came to inherit the house their tax liabilities would have been reduced			2
figures produced for the @entity14 suggest this could have saved them £ 160,000 if they had inherited in 2004			0
@entity246 , senior tax partner at accountancy firm @entity248 said : ‘ a deed of variation is an established part of tax planning but it is not that common			0
generally in the event of someone ’s death the beneficiaries of the estate usually accept what is written in the will and shrug their shoulders and say that is that			0
’ what did @entity0 class as his main home from 1995 until 2004 ? in 1995 @entity0 owned 20 per cent of the family home in @entity267 , but also bought a second - floor flat in nearby @entity64 for around £ 100,000			1
then in 2004 @entity140 bought the @entity267 property outright from @entity0 and their mother			2
you do not pay capital gains tax when you sell your main home , but you do have to pay tax on any gains you make above a certain level on a second home			1
in 2004 , this was charged at a person ’s highest income tax rate on gains of more than £ 8,200			2
@entity0 says he paid tax of 40 per cent on the sale of his stake of @entity267 to @entity140			2
but exactly how much was the bill ? second - home owners have to notify @entity197 which property is their main home			2
but they can switch this at any time			0
every time they do this , the previous three years of house price gains are discounted ( as the rules stand today , it is only 18 months )			2
this allows second - home owners to reduce their tax liability when prices are rising fast			0
if @entity267 was not classed as his main home , it is estimated @entity0 ’s captial gains tax bill could have been up to £ 56,000 , depending on other gains he cashed in at that time			1
so which property was @entity0 living in from 1995 , and which did he tell @entity197 was his main home ? was it ever switched ? where did @entity0 and @entity2 live ? @entity0 first met @entity24 in 2002 and they married in 2011			1
for most of this time up until 2009 they each owned their own property			0
last night a @entity314 spokesman insisted that they only moved in together in 2008			0
however , there are questions about where @entity0 lived between selling his home in 2005 and buying in @entity67 the following year			2
up until 2008 @entity2 owned her own apartment in nearby @entity70			0
had the couple been married and living together only one property would have been able to be classed as a primary residence – the other would have been a second home and as such any gains made on it would have incurred capital gains tax after a period			1
but because they were not married and apparently not living together there would have been no tax to pay			0
the @entity70 home was sold in march 2008			0
it was only at this point that the couple apparently moved in together , into mr @entity0 ’s @entity67 home			1
they eventually moved into a home bought by @entity2 in july 2009			2
@entity0 sold his @entity67 flat in 2009 , five months after @entity2 bought their current home			1
he would have had 18 months to do this before capital gains tax applies .			1

@entity3 want @entity0 to *explain* his family *'s* *complicated* property history
mr @entity0 and his now wife both sold their separate flats in 2008/9
mr @entity0 and @entity2 did not pay any capital gains tax on either deal
he sold his flat five months after they bought their £ 1.6m family home
