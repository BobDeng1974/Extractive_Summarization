@entity1 's ‘ tiny ’ role in the global fight against @entity4 terrorists will be condemned by @entity5 today			1
just two days after the sickening video of a @entity9 pilot being burnt alive emerged , the @entity6 will blast @entity1 ’s contribution in the fight against the terror group as ‘ unacceptable ’ and ‘ deeply concerning ’			1
the @entity1 has so far carried out only 6 per cent of the air strikes against @entity15 jihadists – amounting to less than one a day , the committee ’s report will reveal			1
this is despite @entity33 claiming that defeating is – also known as @entity35 and @entity21 – was a ‘ priority ’ for @entity1			1
in december last year , he said : ‘ we must , with our allies , use everything in our power to defeat it			0
it means defeating @entity21 in @entity27 and @entity44			1
’ but the report says it is ‘ very surprising that the @entity1 @entity49 is doing so little ’ , given the rise of @entity4 has proven the ‘ sum of all our fears ’			1
‘ given that @entity35 is the most dramatic and significant threat to regional stability and international security to have emerged in the @entity54 in decades , we are surprised and deeply concerned that the @entity1 is not doing more , ’ it will say			1
the criticisms come after the @entity56 revealed the @entity49 had delayed a decision to send hundreds of troops to train @entity27 forces for fear of casualties in the run - up to the general election			0
' priority ' : @entity33 insisted during prime minister ’s questions , pictured , he will fight to eradicate is defence secretary @entity66 had announced last year that the soldiers would be deployed to the region in january			1
but despite calls by the @entity27 for help , it is understood there are only 48 @entity1 personnel carrying out training there			2
in addition , there are around 400 @entity1 personnel operating eight tornado jets , a @entity80 spy plane and other @entity1 resources – though most of those are not based in @entity27			2
committee chairman @entity82 mp said : ‘ @entity35 controls territory equivalent to the size of the @entity1 , has contributed to the displacement of millions , destabilising and threatening neighbouring states , and providing a safe haven to an estimated 20,000 foreign fighters – many dedicated to an international terrorist campaign			2
‘ yet the role that the @entity1 is playing in combating it is strikingly modest			2
’ report : committee chairman @entity82 mp , pictured , said the role the @entity1 is playing is ' modest ' if @entity1 does not properly respond to the ‘ threat and horrors represented by @entity35 ’ , there will be political ramifications			1
it would ‘ heighten perceptions ’ that the @entity1 has ‘ stepped back from its international role ’ and could risk undermining wider commitment to the @entity104 - led coalition			0
the report adds : ‘ it would undermine the @entity1 ’s national security interests through destabilisation of the region and through @entity35 ’s sponsorship of terrorist attacks and training of @entity1 foreign fighters in military tactics , which could be used upon the @entity1 public following their return home			1
’ the @entity5 said there was a ‘ significant gap ’ between the rhetoric of @entity1 and its partners and the reality of the campaign on the ground			0
while the politicians did not call for combat troops on the ground , they said the @entity1 should increase its support from the air and meet the request from the @entity27 army to provide training in @entity132 ( @entity133 ) skills			1
mr @entity82 said the @entity1 should deploy @entity135 and far more people in intelligence , planning and regional politics			0
he added : ‘ we must clearly acknowledge the previous failures in @entity27 , and reform our approach			0
but that does not mean lurching to doing nothing			0
the @entity1 should find a way of engaging with @entity27 that is moderate , pragmatic , but energetic			0
‘ there are dozens of things the @entity1 could be doing , without deploying combat troops , to work with coalition partners to help address one of the most extreme threats that we have faced in the last 20 years			0
’ only the deployment of a few hundred personnel would be required , the cost would be relatively modest , and it would not entail the risks inherent in deploying @entity1 troops in combat roles , he said			0
another criticism raised in the report , titled the situation in @entity27 and @entity44 and the response to @entity35 , is how the @entity163 are unable or unwilling to provide a ‘ clear and articulate ’ statement of the @entity1 ’s objectives or strategic plan			2
there was a lack of clarity over who owns a policy – and indeed whether such a policy exists , they found			0
and despite the @entity1 ’s long involvement in @entity27 , there were no @entity1 personnel on the ground with deep expertise in the region			0
it was ‘ unacceptable ’ for the @entity1 to ‘ simply sign up ’ to providing military support for the campaign without any assessment , detail or viability of the campaign plan			0
@entity33 yesterday insisted during prime minister ’s questions he will fight to eradicate @entity188			1
referring to the latest is video , he said : ‘ i can assure the @entity190 that we will not stop until the murderous @entity21 extremists behind this and their poisonous ideology are eradicated			2

@entity1 has so far carried out only 6 per cent of the air strikes against jihadists
despite prime minister claiming that defeating @entity21 was ' priority ' for @entity1
now @entity6 will blast nation 's contribution in report
comes two days after video of @entity9 pilot being burnt alive emerged
