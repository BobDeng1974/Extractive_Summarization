falling asleep on a stranger has been named as the ' most awkward ' situation on board a plane			1
it 's one of those incidents where if it 's you using your neighbour 's shoulder for a nap there 's deep embarrassment , but when others do it , it 's a platform of entertainment			2
new research by a flight comparison website in the @entity19 has discovered the top 10 most awkward scenarios that @entity19 have encountered or witnessed whilst travelling by air			1
as many as three quarters of @entity19 have come across an awkward situation during a flight before , research from flight comparison website @entity35 has revealed			2
falling asleep on a stranger - 65 % 2			2
dropping overhead luggage / items onto the passenger sat below - 61 % 3			1
arguments / confusion over seat allocations - 54 % 4			0
falling onto a fellow passenger accidentally - 50 % 5			2
embarrassing bodily functions ( breaking wind , burping ) - 49 % 6			0
dribbling whilst asleep - 48 % 7			0
lovers ’ tiff / couple arguing - 36 % 8			0
walking in on someone on the loo ( or being walked in on ) - 29 % 9			0

travel sickness - 14 % almost 2,500 @entity19 aged 18 and over , all of whom stated that they had flown at least once in the past two years , were quizzed about any embarrassing encounters or experiences they may have had or witnessed whilst flying			0
all respondents were asked if they had ever encountered any particularly awkward situations during a flight ( either that they had witnessed or experienced themselves ) , to which just over three quarters admitted that they had			1
when provided with a list of possibly awkward scenarios and asked to select all those they 'd witnessed or experienced , the most common , awkward in - flight scenario was seeing a passenger fall asleep on a stranger			1
not far behind in the ranking table was dropping items on a passenger ( 61 per cent ) , followed in third by arguments over seating ( 54 per cent )			0
according to the poll , when witnessing an awkward situation , almost three fifths of respondents , 61 per cent , admitted that that they could n't help but ' watch as the incident unfolded ' , with the remaining respondents stating they either ' shared awkward glances with fellow passengers ' ( 21 per cent ) or tended to ' awkwardly look away , pretending not to notice what 's going on ' ( 18 per cent )			0
a screaming child on a plane , not surprisingly , makes the list of the most awkward situations wanting to determine if @entity19 encountered more awkward situations than others from within @entity86 , 1,000 respondents in total from @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 were quizzed about their experiences , with an even 25 per cent split from each country			1
all respondents were asked ' have you encountered or experienced any particularly awkward situations during a flight before ? ' like the @entity19 , 64 per cent of @entity92 respondents had encountered or experienced awkward or uncomfortable situations on - board a flight , whilst only 21 per cent from @entity90 , 18 per cent from @entity91 and nine per cent from @entity89 had been so unfortunate			1
couples arguing has been spotted by 36 per cent of plane travellers , who often listen on for laughs @entity106 , co-founder of @entity107 , said : ' we 're a little shocked that a couple of instances of arguing and fighting made it into the top ten , but then when you 're a long flight with limited space for movement it 's no surprise that tempers can flare			1
' it 's always wise to remember where you are though and how much trouble you can get into for becoming a nuisance – it would n't be the first time a pilot has had to divert a plane to remove a nuisance passenger			0
' no matter how embarrassing , sometimes we just ca n't help but watch as others are put into awkward situations , just to see how it plays out – there 's no better place to do this than on a flight where you 're confined to a limited space with lots of random strangers			1
' however , it is undoubtedly a completely different story when you find yourself stuck in one of these situations and you have tonnes of eyes peering out at you			0

dropping luggage and falling into seated *people* also make top 10 list
but these awkward situations provide entertainment if not involved
stats show that the @entity89 experience the least awkward plane journeys
