obese people are at greater risk of developing a serious lung disease , scientists have today warned			1
researchers found excessive fat around the waist and low levels of physical activity are linked to the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @entity10 )			1
a team of experts in @entity13 and the @entity14 looked at the relationship between waist and hip circumference , body mass index ( @entity20 ) and exercise levels to @entity10 cases			1
they assessed the link in more than 113,000 men and women in the @entity14 aged between 50 and 70 , who did not have @entity10 , cancer or heart disease at the beginning of the study in 1995			1
a new study conducted by scientists in @entity13 and the @entity14 has found the larger a person 's waistline , the more likely they are to develop a serious lung disease during the 10 - year study , @entity10 developed in 3,648 of those taking part			1
people with larger waists - measuring 110cm or 43.3ins or more in women and 118cm or 46.4ins or more in men - had a 72 per cent increased risk of @entity10			1
study co-author dr @entity44 of @entity45 in @entity13 , said : ' we observed a stronger positive relation with abdominal body fat than with total body fat and @entity10			2
' in particular , overweight as measured by @entity20 emerged as a significant predictor of increased risk of @entity10 only among those with a large waist circumference			1
' dr @entity44 said a large waist was a robust predictor of @entity10 in smokers as well as in people who had never smoked			2
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @entity10 ) is the name for the collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis , emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease			1
pictured is an x-ray of someone suffering the disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @entity10 ) is the name for the collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis , emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease			1
people with @entity10 have difficulties breathing , primarily due to the narrowing of their airways			0
typical symptoms of @entity10 include increasing breathlessness when a person is active , a persistent cough with phlegm and frequent chest infections			0
the main cause of @entity10 is smoking , the longer you smoke the more likely you are to develop the disease			2
this is because smoking irritates the lungs , which results in scarring			0
over many years the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung , thickening the airways , producing more mucus			0
@entity10 is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the @entity96			0
it usually affects people over the age of 35 , although most cases are not diagnosed until a person is in their 50s			0
there are thought to be three million people living with the disease in the @entity96			0
source : @entity106 pollution , smoking and toxic particles in workplace dust are thought to cause @entity10 through chronic inflammation and impaired ability to heal injury to the lungs			0
dr @entity44 said : ' increased local , abdominal and overall fat depots increase local and systemic inflammation , thus potentially stimulating @entity10 - related processes in the lung			2
' people with a large hip circumference and who were physically active at least five times a week were 29 per cent less likely to experience @entity10			2
exercise can reduce inflammation , oxidative stress and enhance healing			0
the findings , published in the @entity129 , also showed that underweight people had a 56 per cent increased risk of @entity10			1
dr @entity44 said possible reasons include malnutrition and reduced muscle mass leading to increased @entity10 susceptibility and progression through inflammatory processes and impaired lung repair capacity			2
dr @entity44 added : ' our findings suggest that next to smoking cessation and the prevention of smoking initiation , meeting guidelines for body weight , body shape and physical activity level may represent important individual and public health opportunities to decrease the risk of @entity10			0
' physicians should encourage their patients to adhere to these guidelines as a means of preventing chronic diseases in general and possibly @entity10 in particular			0

team of scientists in @entity13 studied more than 113,000 men and women aged 50 to 70 over a period of 10 years
scientists found link between large waistline and low levels of exercise and the condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @entity10 )
during study @entity10 developed in 3,648 of those taking part
men with waists measuring 46ins or more and women 43ins or more had a 72 per cent increased risk of developing the lung disease
