@entity0 have no intention of shirking the verbal battle as they seek to defeat defending champions @entity5 in their @entity6 semi-final in @entity8			1
@entity10 's team already know that fellow tournament co-hosts @entity11 will await thursday 's winners in sunday 's final at the @entity15			1
resurgent @entity5 , like the @entity16 so far unbeaten throughout their campaign , are sure to provide a stern test as @entity0 pursue a record fifth title			2
@entity20 ( centre ) will not shirk the verbal battle against @entity5 in the @entity6 semi-final on thursday the left - arm fast bowler will not be put off after @entity25 was fined for verbal exchanges in the last eight @entity27 will not be put off in their quest to retain the trophy , though , by the consequences of @entity25 's epic confrontation with @entity33 fast bowler @entity32 in their last - eight success in @entity35 four days ago			1
@entity25 had to withstand some ferocious short balls and gave as good as he got too in verbal exchanges which resulted in fines for both players under the @entity41 's code of conduct			2
the @entity0 all - rounder emerged the emphatic victor , however - with an unbeaten 64 , having been dropped on four off @entity32 , as he and the big - hitting @entity45 took their team to a six - wicket verdict with almost 16 overs to spare			1
@entity0 's combative opener @entity51 has since suggested he may have to leave the chat to others but @entity20 and @entity54 will happily take over			1
@entity20 told @entity55 : ' i heard @entity57 say he was n't going to get involved in all that stuff			2
someone 's got to do it , and i think i might put my hand up			0
' @entity20 , fellow seamer @entity54 and coach @entity62 all appear most definitely ready to 're - engage '			2
@entity25 and @entity32 were both fined for their exchanges in the quarter - final on friday @entity0 all - rounder @entity54 is another who will not be backing away from the verbal battle @entity0 's left - arm pace spearhead added : ' it 's part of the game - and what happened the other day with @entity25 ( @entity72 ) and @entity32 ( @entity32 ) i thought was exceptional , the way they played the game			1
' it was unfortunate with what happened afterwards			0
i thought it was great entertaining cricket to watch , and i think you 're going to see some more entertainment this game			0
' @entity62 agreed in his column for cricket.com.au : ' i ca n't help but think it 's a bit disappointing that the exchange was deemed to have crossed the line			0
' i 've been interested to read that greats of the game such as @entity92 and @entity93 were surprised that 's how it was interpreted			0
' but i have no doubt the passion and the thrills that @entity32 's spell ignited among the crowd in @entity35 will be there for all to see and hear at the @entity101 when we take on @entity5 in thursday 's semi-final			1
' @entity54 is like - minded : ' there 's going to be words said , and it 's going to be a really tough contest			0
' i think there always is ( sledging ) in the game - if there is n't , you 've got problems			0
' it 's the nature of the game , it 's a semi-final - cut throat			2
@entity0 coach @entity62 said he was disappointed @entity25 's exchange with @entity32 was deemed to have over-stepped the mark @entity20 and his team - mates trained at the @entity101 on tuesday ' neither team will be backing down			1
' @entity5 have defied the expectations of many , not just by progressing so far after playing the stooges in the preceding tri-series against @entity0 and @entity125 but by taking all 70 wickets available to them en route - often with pace , rather than spin			1
number three batsman @entity129 is relishing the chance to prove another point after @entity5 's 109 - run quarter - final trouncing of @entity133			1
' it 's the perfect time for us , an opportunity to do justice to the way we play , ' he told cricket.com.au			0
' we knew we had things to work on ( after the tri-series ) , and not much time			0
' the way our bowlers have reacted , and performed , with composure , confidence and aggression has been wonderful to watch			0
' our bowling attack has come into play in this @entity6 - taking 70 wickets in seven games , that 's probably been the difference			2
' if we can continue to do that , we 'll have a great chance come game day			0

@entity0 play @entity5 in the @entity6 2015 semi-final on thursday
*cos* - hosts @entity11 *booked* their place in the final on tuesday
@entity25 was fined following verbals with @entity33 's @entity32
@entity20 is happy take on sledging *responsibilities* in semi-final
