all of the companies allow customers to fill up paddling pools using hand - held containers such as buckets , but not using hosepipes			1
but warnings have arisen from campaigners saying it can be difficult for the public to interpret rules and this could lead to them being unintentionally flouted			0
campaigners at hosepipeban.org.uk , have taken a critical view of the need for the ban			2
they accused the water companies of ' totally confusing the general public ' and said they have been ' receiving a lot of questions regarding the filling of domestic swimming and paddling pools			1

they said it was ' very unusual once we have sent a letter reminding people of the restrictions that the individual involved continues to break the ban			2
' @entity123 , which covers parts of @entity125 , the @entity126 , @entity70 , @entity127 , @entity128 , and @entity68 said they have had a ' handful of calls and sent a few reminder letters , but we are not in the process of prosecuting anyone			2

' in these cases , we would write to the customers to remind them of the restrictions			2
' the company added that had not ' had to take any further action			0
' similarly , @entity146 , which covers much of the east of @entity17 said : ' we 've had a handful of complaints as the weather has been hotter over the weekend			1
' the water company stressed they ' were not looking to catch people out , ' and were hoping to work with customers			0
on internet forums discussing the hosepipe ban , water customers vocalised their confusion : one user wrote : ' so have i understood this correctly			1
. you ca n’t fill / top up a childs paddling pool using a hose , but you can do it buy using ‘ hand held containers ’ , so buckets then ? is this not going to use the same amount of water anyway ? ? another disgruntled customer wrote : ' so how is filling a pool with a bucket less wasteful than using a hose pipe surely you spill more using a bucket and who is going to know how i filled it up anyway ? ' legislation is in place for prosecution , but during previous hosepipe bans it has never come to this			1
