at first glance @entity0 appears to be an ordinary antique , hidden in a small over-looked office in downtown @entity4 , at the end of a nondescript hallway			1
on closer inspection , however , you will discover it is actually one of the world 's most fascinating relics , celebrating the giddy heights of exploration and adventure			2
what makes the artefact precious is not its beauty or age , but for the inclusion of the inked signatures and routes of nearly every single famous explorer and aviator in modern history , from sir @entity26 , to @entity27 and @entity28			1
the @entity29 's @entity0 : the signature of @entity28 , the first female aviator to fly solo across the @entity31 , is prominently featured the society acquired the 18 - inch globe in 1929 as a gift from @entity29 president @entity35			1
he invited early heroes of exploration and aviation to draw their routes and sign their names @entity42 was immortalised on the spherical relic , along with more recently , @entity44 , who was the first woman to successfully finish a number of arduous expeditions to the @entity47 and @entity48 this 18 - inch globe is hidden beneath a dark cloth in the headquarters of the @entity29 , the oldest established national geographical organisation in the @entity52			1
the valuable tradition of the globe signing started in 1929 , when the society president , and editor - in - chief of the @entity57 , @entity35 would personally go down to the @entity59 docks to welcome returning adventurers			0
explorers would ink their routes and names on the prized object , documenting their piece of history in the moment it happened			1
among those commemorated is @entity28 who set records becoming the first woman to fly across the @entity31 in 1928 , and was the first individual to fly over both the @entity31 and @entity72			1
tragically the aviation pioneer mysteriously disappeared in 1937 as she was trying to circumnavigate the globe from the equator , and was legally declared dead in 1939			0
on may 20 , 1927 , pilot @entity76 embarked on the world 's first solo non-stop flight from @entity79 to @entity80			1
enduring a 33.5 - hour crossing , the 25 - year - old was victorious and received international stardom , and his route was marked onto the globe to document the achievement			0
sadly tragedy stuck in 1932 when his 20 - month - old son was kidnapped and tragically murdered in what was called , ' the @entity90			0
' in the society 's own words , the globe is ' a priceless and unique symbol of humanity 's unquenchable drive to explore the universe			0
' a crowning glory of the @entity29 institution , the globe would not have always seemed as out of place			2
the society was created in 1851 following sir @entity104 's disappearance on his @entity47 mission			0
a group of like - minded explorers banded together to create a rescue mission , and thus , the @entity29 was born			1
@entity110 explorer , sir @entity26 , became the first climber to reach the summit of @entity113 , ( left ) , and @entity114 who made the first solo transatlantic airplane flight in 1927 , ( right )			0
both explorers are featured on the globe @entity28 stands june 14 , 1928 in front of her bi-plane called ' friendship ' in @entity121			1
she inked her name on the prized artefact astronauts @entity125 , ( left ) , and @entity126 , ( right ) signed the @entity29 globe , after their space missions , orbiting the earth , and walking on the moon respectively 1			1
@entity204 despite the mission being unsuccessful the @entity29 grew in popularity , with scholars , businessmen and government officials joining the ranks , at its then office , a celebrated neo-classical building in @entity213 , to discuss latest geographic news			1
unlike rivals , @entity216 , who focused on photography and popular geography , the @entity79 based society placed its efforts on sponsoring expeditions , geographic research and education			0
the society was the principal map resource for the @entity52 for decades , and at its peak had a permanent staff force of over 80 , contractually making maps for the government			0
government revenues died down after the war , and with the @entity29 losing a lot of donations , the headquarters were sold in 1970			2
the original headquarters of the @entity29 in @entity213 , where they would discuss geographical news astronaut @entity125 , ( right ) signs is name on the @entity29 's @entity241 at the @entity242 in @entity213 on feb 26 , 1962			2
@entity243 , president of the society , ( centre ) watches , with president @entity246 and vice president @entity247 gathering behind ( left ) the society ended up in the small rental office in @entity4 and on the verge of disappearing into history			2
it is strange that the globe , arguably the most fascinating in the world , is hidden away with nobody to witness the journey of @entity184 , who in 1933 was the first to fly around the world , or @entity181 , the first man to the @entity257			2
current executive director , @entity258 , said : ' it sits in my office and no one sees it			0
i 'd like to get it into the public			0
' the society is facing a revival , with plans to relocate back to @entity59 , to the redeveloping @entity270 neighborhood , poignantly close to where the @entity35 would first ask explorers to leave their ink mark on history			0
@entity184 , first pilot to fly solo around the world , inked his route on the @entity29 's globe this unique artefact bears inked routes of their world changing adventures , but is rarely seen by anyone the 18 - inch globe sits proudly in the office , holding a small slice of history of the world 's most celebrated explorers			1
