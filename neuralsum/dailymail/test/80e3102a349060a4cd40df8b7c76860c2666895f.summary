when @entity1 , a mother - of - four from @entity2 in @entity3 , began to suspect that her partner @entity4 was having an affair , she was heartbroken			1
but in a twist that she could never have foreseen , the other woman turned out to be her younger sister @entity8			1
now , three years after the affair that tore her family apart , ms @entity1 says she is still struggling to come to terms with what happens - and still has bad days when she ca n't stop crying			1
' she was n't just my sister			2
she was like a best friend and i 'd do anything for her			0
' but all that changed when @entity8 , who is seven years younger than ms @entity1 , moved into her home when she was 17			1
although @entity8 says there was nothing between her and @entity4 to begin with , a night out when she was 20 resulted in a liaison with her sister 's partner - and the start of an affair			1
' i was 20 when it first started with @entity4 , ' she confesses			2
' i went out one night , had a few too many drinks , came back , saw him and we started kissing			0
' the next morning , i woke up and thought , " what have you done ? " i do n't know why i carried it on to be honest but i did			0
after the first few months , i did start getting feelings and began falling for him			0
' upset : @entity1 appeared on @entity43 's @entity42 to tell her story rapprochement : @entity8 is finally winning back her sister after more than three years in the cold caught in the middle : @entity49 was caught in the centre of the increasingly acrimonious dispute noticing that the pair were spending increasing amounts of time together , ms @entity1 became suspicious but , believing that her sister would do nothing to hurt her , stayed quiet			1
' i mentioned it to a couple of friends , to a couple of work colleagues , ' she remembers			0
' one or two of my friends actually said , " what you 're thinking , it 's probably feasible "			0
' @entity67 , including my mum , said , " what are you thinking ? that 's your sister			2
she would never do that to you "			0
' then , a few months later , @entity8 revealed she was pregnant and claimed not to know who the father was			1
' @entity8 had never really had a boyfriend			1
if she had , i 'd never met any			0
then one day i came home from work and she said she was pregnant , ' ms @entity1 recalls			2
but she was left even more suspicious by her sister and mr @entity82 's reaction			2
' @entity8 and @entity4 were both over the moon about it , really happy , ' she says			1
' i was quite concerned			0
i really felt like i was going crazy , like i was losing it			0
i was having a battle in my own mind			0
' putting her fears to one side , she supported her sister and was there when @entity8 gave birth to her son @entity16 in august 2011			1
speaking on @entity43 's @entity42 , ms @entity1 says she was convinced that her sister was the other woman the moment she saw the newborn			1
shock : @entity1 also spoke of the moment that she realised her sister 's baby had been fathered by her partner ' i had suspicions anyway but as soon as i saw the baby , i knew because not only did it look like @entity4 , it look like my children when they were babies			1
it was just too much for coincidence			0
' i had to run out of the room			0
i saw a friend straight after and i said , " that baby is @entity4 's "			1
@entity8 , who moved out into a council flat of her own shortly afterwards , continued to deny all talk of an affair			2
but then , consumed with guilt , she finally confessed the truth to their mother @entity49 in a text message that read : ' well what 's she going to do when she finds out @entity16 is @entity4 's ? i ca n't hide it any more			1
' ' i answered the phone and my mum 's in a panic , ' remembers ms @entity1			2
' she was actually crying , so i said , " calm down mum , what 's happened ? " ' and she said , " i 'm sorry to tell you but what you 've been worrying about is true "			0
' ms @entity1 was , she says , left ' utterly devastated ' by the news and furious that despite repeated questioning , both @entity8 and @entity4 had point - blank denied having an affair			1
then , a few days after the bombshell hit , @entity4 moved out of ms @entity1 's home and in with her sister			1
' it was a nightmare , ' remembers ms @entity1			2
' i did send her some nasty text messages			0
i called her every name under the sun. i think most people in my position would have			0
' @entity8 responded angrily and more than three years on , the sisters are still estranged and struggling to come to terms with what happened			1
' it 's still heartbreaking really , ' adds ms @entity1			2
' to think we were really close and that 's all gone			0
it 's non existent now			0
