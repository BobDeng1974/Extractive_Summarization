by @entity0 published : 20:29 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 20:36 est , 5 december 2012 having fertility treatment doubles the chances of a child developing asthma , say researchers			2
they found children born after @entity7 have a twofold higher risk of wheezing and are up to four times more likely to take anti-asthmatic medicines by the age of five			1
scientists discovered the link after analysing data on 18,818 children from across the @entity17 born between 2000 and 2002			2
higher risk after @entity7 : children born after fertility treatment have double the risk of developing asthma , researchers claim but they say the findings do not prove that asthma is triggered by @entity7 and any children born as a result remain at low risk			1
over 1.4 million @entity30 children have asthma and rates have shot up four-fold since the 1970s			0
the causes of the disease are poorly understood , but genetic and environmental factors are thought to play roughly equal roles			0
researchers conducting the @entity17 @entity38 compared children in different groups with those born after natural planned pregnancies			2
children born to sub-fertile parents were 39 per cent more likely to be experiencing asthma symptoms by the age of five and 27 per cent more likely to wheeze than children born after planned pregnancies			0
but closer analysis found a stronger link between asthma and children conceived via some form of assisted reproduction treatment including @entity7 ( in vitro fertilisation )			1
they had a risk of developing asthma more than two - and - a - half times higher , nearly two-fold increased risk of wheezing and more than four-fold increased risk of taking anti-asthmatic medications			0
first @entity17 study : researchers from @entity65 ( pictured ) conducted the study and found that @entity7 children were also twice as likely to develop wheezing and up to four times more likely to have taken anti-asthma medicine by the age of five the risks were slightly reduced at the age of seven , according to a report in the medical journal @entity74			1
the researchers said their findings should be interpreted with caution as only 104 children in the study were born after fertility treatment			2
lead researcher dr @entity80 , from @entity65 , said ‘ @entity82 asthma is a common condition in the @entity17 where the prevalence of the condition is higher than other @entity87 countries , and to our knowledge this is the first @entity17 study of asthma after @entity7 conceptions			1
‘ our analysis suggests that it is the assisted reproduction group in particular who are at higher risk			0
’ there could be a number of possible explanations for the link between infertility , ivf and asthma , including the severity of the infertility and possible role played by treatment , say the researchers			1
the scientists took account of mothers ’ asthma and smoking history , body mass index - which relates weight to height - socio - economic status , the presence of furry household pets and other factors previously suspected to be asthma triggers that could have affected the findings			0
in the paper they wrote : ' children born after @entity120 have a much higher risk , though we can not determine if this is indicative of a treatment effect or related to a greater degree of sub-fertility in this group of parents			0
linked : @entity129 found that there was a strong link between asthma and children conceived via some form of assisted reproduction treatment including @entity7 ( pictured ) ' if the observed association is causal , then the mechanism driving it remains unknown and further research in this area is warranted			1
' dr @entity141 said it was important to remember that in absolute terms the extra number of @entity7 children developing asthma was small			1
she said : ‘ fifteen per cent of the children in our study had asthma at the age of five			2
although this figure was higher , 24 per cent , in the @entity7 children , it is n’t much higher than the one in five risk for all children in the @entity17			1
‘ it is also important to remember that for most children , asthma is a manageable condition and should n’t prevent children from living a full and active life			0
’ @entity163 , research analysis and communications officer at @entity17 , said ‘ this study suggests that there might be an association between @entity7 treatment and asthma developing in children , but the sample size for this study is small and currently the research in this area generally is not conclusive			1
‘ overall research suggests that the absolute risk of asthma increasing after @entity7 appears to be small			0
‘ further work is needed to establish what might be causing this association and whether there are other factors at play other than the @entity7 treatment itself			0
‘ in the meantime those considering @entity7 should speak to their gp about the benefits and health risks in order to make an informed decision			0

@entity7 children were also twice as likely to develop wheezing and up to four times more likely to have taken anti-asthma medicine by the age of five
researchers from @entity65 are the first to conduct a @entity17 study of asthma after @entity7 conceptions
explanations might include the severity of the infertility and the role played by treatment
