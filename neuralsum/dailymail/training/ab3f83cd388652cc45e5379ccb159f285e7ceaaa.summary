by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter experts have determined the disease that has brought @entity6 orange production to its lowest levels in 30 years and led to a massive price spike throughout the country			2
a gnat - sized bug called the @entity12 citrus psyllid is believed to be the insect spreading the deadly bacteria that has cut the state 's production dramatically			1
the gnat is not the only problem facing the plants , as citrus greening disease and an unexpectedly harsh winter posed their own problems for the crop			2
lower production : a combination of a new strand of bacteria , a brutally cold winter and other standard threats have led the @entity30 to set lower production targets for @entity6 's orange crop in coming years farmers do n't know what to do to fix the issue , as they have kept on check with insecticide and mineral treatments in the soil			1
harder work : farmers are trying their best to fight off the bacteria by being diligent with their use of insecticide but that is n't enough ' we spray at least every four weeks ... but we are not keeping pace with the spread , ' said @entity49 , a family farmer whose 5,000 acres near @entity50 have been struck by the spreading disease			0
' it feels we are losing the fight , ' he told the @entity54			0
as a result , @entity56 orange juice prices hit two - year highs last week after a government crop report trimmed last month 's forecasts for production and yield from @entity6			1
the @entity56 @entity30 cut its latest estimates for @entity6 's orange output and yield in a report issued after one of the most brutal winters in decades			1
@entity6 's orange output for 2013/14 had been reduced to 110 million boxes from a previous forecast of 114 boxes in march , the @entity30 said			1
' the @entity6 all orange forecast , at 110 million boxes ( 4.95 million tons ) , is down 4 percent from the previous forecast and down 18 per cent from last season 's final utilization , ' it said			0
yields for frozen concentrated orange juice were revised to an estimated 1.6 gallons a box , from last month 's forecast of 1.61 gallons			0
the yields were ' down 1 per cent from the march forecast but up 1 per cent from last season 's final yield of 1.59 gallons per box , ' it added			0
backlash : as a result of lower production , @entity56 orange juice prices hit two - year highs last week adding to farmer 's problems is the fact that orange juice consumption has dropped by 30 per cent since 2003 as a result of the growing number of drink options available and the growing tendancy to skip breakfast			2
' juice is often associated with breakfast and as our society changes , we rush ourselves a little bit and we have a tendency to skip it , ' said @entity107 official @entity106 .			0
