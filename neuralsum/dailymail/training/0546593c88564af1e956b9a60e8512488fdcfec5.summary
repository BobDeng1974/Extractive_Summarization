by @entity0 for @entity1 early modern humans had already developed distinct cultural traditions before they left @entity4			1
researchers carried out the largest ever comparative study of stone tools between 130,000 and 75,000 years old to shed new light on our ancestors			1
the tools , discovered in the region between @entity13 and @entity14 , were made in different ways , reflecting a diversity of cultural traditions			1
researchers carried out the largest ever comparative study of stone tools dating between 130,000 and 75,000 years old to shed new light on our ancestors			1
a collection of prehistoric tools are pictured a new study also identified at least four distinct populations , each relatively isolated from each other with their own different cultural characteristics			1
it also suggests that early populations took advantage of rivers and lakes that criss - crossed the @entity32 desert			2
a climate model coupled with data about these ancient rivers was matched with the new findings on stone tools to reveal that populations connected by rivers had similarities in their cultures			1
this could be the earliest evidence of different populations ‘ budding ’ across the @entity32 , using the rivers to disperse and meet people from other populations , according to the paper published in the journal , @entity49			1
researchers from the @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity53 took over 300,000 measurements of stone tools from 17 archaeological sites across @entity4			1
they combined the data about the tools with the environmental model for the first time , which showed that the @entity32 was then a patchwork of savannah , grasslands and water , interspersed with desert			2
the new study also identified at least four distinct populations , each relatively isolated from each other with their own different cultural characteristics			1
it also suggests that early populations took advantage of rivers and lakes that criss - crossed the @entity32 desert			2
an artist 's impression of early humans is pictured the study supports other recent theories that modern humans may have first successfully left @entity4 earlier than 60,000 - 50,000 years ago , dr @entity75 said			0
dr @entity79 , from the @entity80 at the @entity51 , said : ‘ the question of whether there was an early successful exit from @entity4 has become one of whether any of the populations discovered in this paper went in and out of @entity4 for some or all of this time			0
a crucial next step involves fieldwork in areas such as the @entity90 to understand how these populations spread into @entity14			0
’ ongoing fieldwork seeking to do just that is making ‘ remarkable discoveries ’ in the deserts of @entity90 , which may also have been the region where both @entity97 and homo sapiens populations might have interacted , he explained			0
the team also mapped out known ancient rivers and major lakes so they could piece together where populations made and used their tools , according to the study , which is published in the journal @entity49			2
the results show , for the first time , how early populations of modern humans dispersed across the @entity32 before forming small populations by the rivers			2
‘ this is the first time that scientists have identified that early modern humans at the cusp of dispersal out of @entity4 were grouped in separate , isolated and local populations , ’ dr @entity75 , visiting scholar at the @entity51 and lead author of the study said			0
‘ @entity120 tools are the only form of preserved material culture for most of human history			0
in @entity4 , owing to the hot climate , ancient dna has not yet been found			0
‘ these stone tools reveal how early populations of modern humans dispersed across the @entity32 just before they left @entity4			1
while different populations were relatively isolated , we were interested to find that when connected by rivers , they share similarities in their tool - making suggesting some interaction with one another			0
’ the researchers used a variety of tests in order to rule that tools from different areas were culturally distinct simply because of differences in raw materials			0
the tools , discovered in the region between @entity13 and @entity14 - including the desert ( marked on the map ) - were made in different ways , reflecting a diversity of cultural traditions the study looking at different types of tools , has for the first time shown how early populations of modern humans dispersed across the @entity32 before forming small populations by the rivers dr @entity75 said : ‘ not much is known about the structure of early modern human populations in @entity4 , particularly at the time of their earliest dispersals into @entity14			1
‘ our picture of modern human demography around 100,000 years ago is that there were a number of populations , varying in size and degree of genetic contact , distributed over a wide geographical area			0
‘ this model of our population history supports other theories recently put forward that modern humans may have first successfully left @entity4 earlier than 60,000 - 50,000 years ago , which had been the common view among scholars			0
‘ our work provides important new evidence that sheds light on both the timing of early modern human dispersals out of @entity4 and the character of our interaction with other human species , such as @entity97			0
