@entity2 , 24 , has endured an injury - plagued career after coming through the @entity3 academy and even being named @entity6 under - 19 player of the year at one stage			2
in his younger years , @entity9 had identified him as a future star but at the age of 21 , he was forced to retire with a degenerative knee injury that had caused him pain since the age of 12			0
chance : versatile defender @entity2 could be given the chance to resurrect his career at @entity0 fitness : @entity2 ( centre ) spent 15 years at @entity20 but was seriously hampered by injuries however , he since fought back against the odds with a prescribed rehabilitation programme and earned himself a new deal with @entity3 under @entity25 but has been unable to break into the first - team before being released at the end of last season			1
he impressed on loan at @entity30 last season after previous loan spells with @entity32 and @entity33			2
@entity2 is a target for @entity35 at @entity36 but new @entity0 boss @entity37 is understood to have made an approach this week and is confident of signing @entity2 , who may now finally have his chance on the @entity41 stage			0
@entity30 also remain interested .			0
