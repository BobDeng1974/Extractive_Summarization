by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 03:52 est , 10 july 2013 @entity1 bought a whole new audience to the work of @entity4 when he emerged from a lake with a wet shirt in the @entity8 adaptation of her classic novel @entity11			1
now the scene that set viewers ' heart racing has been commemorated in a hugely unusual way - with a giant version of the character mr @entity18 emerging from a lake in @entity21 's @entity20			2
the fibre - glass made sculpture caused a stir amongst passers - by as well as wildlife as it rose up from the @entity28 over the sunny weekend			1
the version of the romantic hero is largely based on @entity1 's portrayal but lead lead sculptor @entity51 said they also got inspiration from the book and the other actors who have played mr @entity18 over the years			1
in the making : the model took a team of three sculptors more than two months to design challenge : project manager @entity51 and sculptor @entity61 carry the giant head before it 's ready to be painted various sources : @entity51 said they were inspired by the book and other portrayals of mr @entity18 to create the statue he said : ' we took @entity1 's famous lake scene as a starting point for creating mr @entity18 but we also read the book and looked at performances of the brooding hero by @entity74 , @entity75 and even @entity76			1
' the challenge for us was capturing the spirit of @entity18 as handsome and noble but also aloof and proud			0
the mr @entity18 sculpture is a real mix of the many portrayals of @entity4 's most famous hero			2
' a swimmer takes a closer look at the statue : it will soon go on tour around the country before being placed at @entity89 where the famous scene was filmed the installation was commissioned to celebrate the launch of @entity94 's new tv channel @entity95 and mr @entity18 was chosen because @entity97 's lake exit from the @entity8 's 1995 adaptation of @entity11 was named the most memorable @entity100 tv drama moment of all time in a recent survey			1
@entity102 , general manager of @entity94 channel @entity95 said : ' the giant mr @entity18 in @entity28 is a fitting tribute to one of the most memorable moments in @entity100 tv drama			2
@entity4 spent a lot of time walking in @entity20 and along the banks of the @entity28 so we would like to think she would have approved of our new dashing @entity18			0
' those outside @entity21 do n't have to miss out on the homage			0
mr @entity18 will embark on a short regional tour to venues including @entity119 beach , before it is installed at @entity89 in @entity121 , where the scene was first filmed			1
it will remain in place in the lake at @entity89 until february 2014			2
since 1995 , @entity1 has become a spy and the @entity127 , played gay and straight men and portrayed a family man as well as a bachelor			0
he 's won countless awards , including an @entity133 for the @entity134 , yet for many , he will always be mr @entity18			0
' i dare say if i did spend my waking hours reading my own fan mail i probably would feel @entity18 was following me around , ' he once told the @entity138			0
' but i 've got family and friends and children and none of them call me mr @entity18			0
' acclaimed : @entity1 won an @entity133 for @entity134 - but for many he 'll always be mr @entity18 the actor admitted he had never read @entity4 's novel before taking the role and nearly turned it down because at 35 , he could n't believe he was romantic lead material			1
and while the part made him a household name , he admitted it was n't always easy being constantly associated with a literary hero			0
he said : ' in the years between @entity11 and @entity18 , i do n't think there was a single interview in any newspaper that did n't have @entity18 in the headline			0
' romantic hero : the actor admitted he had n't read @entity11 before he took the role but while for a time he may have resented the fact he could never escape the role , by taking part in the film adaptations of @entity160 the now 52 - year - old has proved he can have a sense of humour about it			1
author @entity165 was inspired by @entity4 with her bestselling books on hapless @entity18			0
the character had a crush on @entity1 in the @entity8 's @entity11 and her own love interest was called @entity18			1
@entity18 again : this time in @entity160 in a stroke of casting genius , @entity1 takes on the role of @entity18 in the films ( a third is currently being produced ) and one scene where he fights with @entity177 's character in a fountain pokes fun at his infamous lake scene			2
neither @entity1 or the director of the @entity8 production , @entity183 , had any idea how iconic the scene would become , still beloved by audiences 18 years later			1
mr @entity183 told the @entity138 : ' nobody had the slightest inkling that @entity1 , wearing a lightweight cotton voile shirt with his nipples showing underneath , would have such an effect			0
' watch the famous scene from @entity8 's @entity193 below ...			2
