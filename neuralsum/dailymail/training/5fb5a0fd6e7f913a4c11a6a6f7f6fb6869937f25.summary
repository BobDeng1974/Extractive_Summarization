by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor every political leader needs to be able to explain their mission in life to voters			1
but challenged to sum up his vision in a single word , @entity7 failed miserably , waffling on for 111 words which did little to shed light on his labour plans for @entity13			1
the episode will do little to persuade his critics – including many in his own party – that he is too wordy and academic to make a connection with the average voter			1
labour leader @entity7 proved himself unable to sum up his leadership in a single word during a visit to @entity23 in @entity24 mr @entity7 was speaking at an event in in @entity23 , @entity24 – a seat labour is hoping to win back next year			1
but in last week ’s local elections @entity27 lost ground , raising fears mr @entity7 ’s leadership is failing to connect with the electorate with a year until the general election			1
after delivering a speech on immigration , mr @entity7 took questions from activists and journalists			1
it was put to him that he is ‘ too wordy and too academic ’ and challenged to give just one word which ‘ defines your leadership and tells voters what makes you different ’			1
but mr @entity7 floundered , choosing at first to give not one but two words : ‘ @entity47			1
’ but perhaps realising that this abstract slogan , borrowed from 19th century @entity49 prime minister @entity48 , mr @entity7 went on to flesh out his ideas			1
' i 'll give you two : @entity47			1
' @entity47 is an idea about how you bring every person in the country to make a contribution and show their potential			1
' and that 's what i 'm about			2
' and that 's what i 'm about for @entity13			1
' and i think it shows that @entity27 is a party that is reaching out to people across our country and that @entity27 has an answer			2
' and in the end , the question is does that country succeed with people at the top doing well ? ' or does it succeed when actually ordinary people are supported ? ' and that is the big question for @entity13			2
' and actually i believe that will be the big question for @entity13 at the next election			2
' he said the soundbite was about ‘ how you bring every person in the country to make a contribution and show their potential ’ , adding : ‘ that 's what i 'm about			0
’ he claimed that was what he was ‘ about for @entity13 ’ and said @entity27 is ‘ reaching out to people across our country and that @entity27 has an answer ’			2
realising that no - one knew what the question was to which @entity27 had an answer , mr @entity7 continued : ‘ in the end , the question is does that country succeed with people at the top doing well ? or does it succeed when actually ordinary people are supported ? ‘ and that is the big question for @entity13			1
and actually i believe that will be the big question for @entity13 at the next election			2
’ aides said mr @entity7 could sum up his leadership in a single word but ' chose not to '			1
however , the apparent inability to succinctly sum up what he stands for comes after a series of @entity113 gaffes by the @entity27 leader			2
in the run - up to the local and @entity117 elections last week he was skewered on live tv over the cost of his weekly shopping bill			0
having campaigned on the rising cost of living , accusing the government of being out of touch , he was unable to say how much he spent himself			0
he suggested it might be £ 70 or £ 80 a week , but was told the average for a family of four was more than £ 100			0
it later emerged he regularly shops in a smart delicatessen near his @entity131 home where a loaf of bread costs £ 2.25			0
the next day he embarked on a tour of 10 areas to promote 10 policies , but on the first stop he was pictured make a meal of eating a bacon sandwich			0
after a set of embarrassing photographs were published online , the rest of the tour continued without publicity			0
asked about the sandwich yesterday , mr @entity7 said : ‘ honestly , really and truly , this is not what politics is about			1
’ mr @entity7 said he could describe his vision as ' @entity47 ' , but it took him a lot of words even to explain that instead he faced fresh pressure over @entity27 's response to the rise of @entity156 and tackling public concern about immigration			1
he said : ' i am the son of immigrants			0
i am proud of the contribution my parents made to this country			0
i believe immigration benefits our country as a whole			0
but it needs to be properly managed			0
' i have changed @entity27 ’s position on immigration since 2010 because it is not prejudiced to worry about immigration , it is understandable			0
' @entity27 would have controls when people arrive and leave here , we will tackle the undercutting of wages , we will ensure people in public services speak @entity180 and people need to earn their entitlements			0
' he said : ' these are the right principles for our immigration policy			0
' he added : ' looking to the future , openness , concern for the poorest and a belief in the modern economy were not wrong			0
' but it was not enough			0
that ’s why as i have said since i became leader , there is no future for @entity27 saying we should simply pick up from where we left off in 2010			2

labour leader challenged over whether he is too wordy and academic
asked to explain his vision for @entity13 in a single word for voters
@entity7 explained it was ' @entity47 ' but then went on at length
