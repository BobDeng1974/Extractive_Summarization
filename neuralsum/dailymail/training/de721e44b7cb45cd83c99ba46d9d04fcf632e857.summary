@entity0 and former prime minister @entity1 held a secret meeting at @entity3 ahead of the media tycoon 's takeover of @entity7 newspapers , it has been revealed			1
mr @entity0 personally lobbied the @entity9 over sunday lunch on january 4 , 1981 , mrs @entity1 's files show			1
neither party has ever admitted that such a meeting took place , but details of the meeting have now been uncovered in a note written by @entity1 ’s press secretary @entity17 and marked ' commercial - in confidence '			1
power players : @entity0 and @entity1 , pictured at a @entity21 awards dinner in 1991 , have never admitted they met ahead of his @entity7 newspapers takeover the files reveal that mr @entity0 requested the chat , which came three weeks before the first cabinet committee discussion of his takeover			1
the @entity27 sent a handwritten thank - you note to ' my dear prime minister ' two weeks later , telling her that ' the field has contracted down to only two or three of us ' and that @entity7 owners the @entity34 family would ' make up their minds in the next day or so '			0
mr @entity0 was confirmed as owner of @entity7 and @entity38 in february 1981			1
at no point did mrs @entity1 publicise the meeting , and she also instructed that the note on the lunch should not leave no 10 @entity43			0
the impression given in the newspaper 's official history is that mr @entity0 had had no contact with the prime minister ahead of the government 's approval of his purchase			2
mr @entity17 's note shows that the media boss tried to bond with the @entity55 prime minister by praising @entity57 's new administration			0
confined to @entity58 : press secretary @entity17 's note on the @entity9 's meeting with the media tycoon he then explicitly briefed her on his bid and plans for @entity65 , including taking on the unions , introducing new technology and reducing the workforce by 25 per cent			1
he outlined his intention to make the operation profitable by introducing technology and lowering manning levels			0
but records show there was no discussion of whether a bid would be referred to the @entity76			0
the government had the power to block the takeover by such a referral because mr @entity0 already owned @entity81 and the @entity82			1
the deal was apparently not referred to the @entity76 because ministers feared the newspapers could close if not sold quickly			0
trade secretary @entity86 made the decision - but recently released minutes from the economic strategy committee meeting on 26 january show that the @entity9 spoke to highlight the exemption under the @entity90 that would allow mr @entity0 's bid to avoid a referral			1
growing empire : the minutes from the lunch included a comment by mr @entity0 that the monetary risks ' could finish us ' the newspaper group went on to become the biggest in @entity99			2
@entity100 even came close to taking full control of @entity102 30 years later , but the deal collapsed in furore that followed the revelation that murder victim @entity107 's phone had been hacked by the @entity82			1
@entity110 's first meeting with a media owner was with mr @entity0 in july 2010 , two months after he became prime minister			1
the businessman entered no 10 by the back door and the meeting was not initially disclosed when @entity110 first published a list of meetings with media owners and newspaper editors in july last year			0
the @entity1 papers have been released by the @entity121 , @entity122 , after 30 years			0
' my dear prime minister ' : the pm in 1983 , left , and mr @entity0 discussing the future of @entity7 at a press conference in @entity127 on january 22 1981 , right it contradicts the account in the official history of @entity7 that says mrs @entity1 and mr @entity0 ' had no communication whatsoever during the period in which the @entity7 bid and referral was up for discussion '			2
it suggests the tycoon relied on the columnist @entity138 to plead his case			0
mr @entity17 's note on the lunch says the newspaper owner offered to arrange a meeting for the pm with a group of ' @entity146 ' politicians on her upcoming visit to @entity21			2
he also dismissed rival bidders , including @entity150 , as unlikely to impress either mr @entity151 , unions or journalists			0
mr @entity0 added that he was risking £ 50m of @entity155 's resources in the deal and that such an amount ' could finish us '			1
mr @entity17 writes that @entity1 did nothing more than ' wish him well in his bid ' as well as noting the need to improve @entity163 staffing levels and introduce new technology			0
the later cabinet committee minutes confirm mrs @entity1 's role in the discussion but also that the trade department 's accountants had advised that the @entity7 was not economic as a going concern			0
many people who wanted the @entity76 to block @entity0 's takeover believed that the @entity38 would return to financial health .			2
