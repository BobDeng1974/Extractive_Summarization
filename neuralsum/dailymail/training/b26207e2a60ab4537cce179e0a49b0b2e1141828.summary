@entity0 has criticised @entity1 's ' @entity3 ' awards - by claiming they are bad for football			1
@entity6 and @entity7 are the two @entity9 players who have been shortlisted for the accolade			1
but @entity0 , speaking in his friday press conference ahead of the trip to @entity13 on saturday , said : ' when i see these trophies , i think they are not good for football			1
i do n't care about it			2
videos scroll down to watch @entity7 claims he could be in the best form of his career , was all smiles in @entity9 training @entity9 boss @entity0 insists he will not rest any players as ' all competitions are important ' @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 have both been nominated for @entity1 's @entity3 ' sometimes it seems we are looking for stars , people who are more important than other people and that is not the culture in this club			1
' the mentality here is not to worry about that , even less be obsessed with that			2
when i see the names are @entity7 and @entity6 , i think they do n't think about it			2
' they think about the team and try to win matches			2
' however , @entity0 was far more positive looking ahead to the match - up with @entity13 at the @entity45 which could see @entity9 move nine points clear at the top of the @entity48 , at least temporarily			1
@entity49 ( centre ) attempts to dispossess captain @entity51 in training on thursday he continued : ' people are confident and happy to play the way they 're playing			2
' ( @entity56 is ) a risk we do n't have			2
we have all the other risks - a bad period , injuries , unlucky matches , other teams ' great evolution but complacency is not a risk we have			2
' it is not the profile of this group			0
we were winning 5 - 0 against @entity69 and in the 88th minute @entity6 made a sprint to defend			0
there was a clear evolution in these young people			1
' yes , there 's more to come			1
i think there is much more to come			0
' it 's a young team , with lots of young players			1
i have two more years of contract			0
they want to stay , i want to stay			0
we have a lot ahead of us			0
' club captain @entity51 appears relaxed in training as his in form side prepare to face @entity13 @entity88 scored from the spot during @entity13 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity9 in the league last season @entity9 have gone 19 games unbeaten so far this season in all competitions but records will not deter @entity96 and his @entity13			1
@entity13 ended @entity0 's 77 - game unbeaten home record in the @entity48 in april and also knocked them out of the @entity100 at the @entity45 last season			1
but @entity0 is still positive			1
he said : ' there 's been lots of water under the bridge since then			1
it 's a difficult game			1
' what happened last season was an isolated situation			1
i go to this game worried about many things but not about what happened last season			1
' that match was impossible to win - but we move on			1
we are happy with the way we 're doing things			0
' @entity0 would not be drawn on whether or not @entity49 is the best striker in the league when asked if @entity49 was the best striker in the @entity48 , @entity0 refused to be drawn on such a debate			1
' i am not in favour of this kind of situation , ' he said			0
' in some cases it looks like we 're doing a political campaign and i do n't think it 's a good way			1
is he a top striker ? yes he is			2
' and the @entity130 is extremely impressed by the whole of his squad - including those who are not currently getting a run in the side			2
he added : ' my untouchables now are the ones that are not playing			0
they are responsible for what we are doing			0
i do not have one who is not training hard , behaving well			0
' life is easy when you are always playing and winning and feeling high in your self - esteem			0
life is difficult when you are not playing			0
' players were born to play			0
all these guys in my squad are fantastic			0
' @entity9 keeper @entity154 pulls off another save in training			1
hoping to keep a clean sheet on saturday when asked why his squad is not picking up the injuries which appear to have ravaged the likes of @entity161 and @entity162 , @entity0 put it down to plain luck			1
' we also struggle to keep them fit			0
we work hard and try our best			0
it is a bit of everything including luck			0
' things can change very quick			0
we are not in a position to say we do not care about certain competitions			2
' for us , every compn is important and every match important			0
we try to play with our best team			0
we need a bit of luck also			0
' @entity154 shows off his athleticism in training , having established himself as @entity9 's @entity181 this season			1

@entity9 travel to @entity45 to face @entity13 ( saturday *5.30pm* )
@entity0 's side are unbeaten in all competitions this season
@entity188 would see the @entity189 move nine points clear at top of table
