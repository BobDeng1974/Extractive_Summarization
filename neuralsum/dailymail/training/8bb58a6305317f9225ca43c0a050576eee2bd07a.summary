@entity1 match delegate @entity0 – whose report backed referee @entity3 in all of his key decisions during @entity6 's controversial clash with @entity7 – will only return to his role next week … when @entity6 face @entity9			1
@entity10 can reveal that the 45 - year - old is not on match duty this weekend but will be in the stands at @entity14 assessing @entity15 and his assistants next wednesday			1
that means he will again be returning his verdict on decisions involving @entity22 's men			2
this studs - up tackle from @entity24 infuriated @entity25 and @entity22 backed up his player @entity25 will miss the @entity28 final after @entity3 sent him off the match delegate backed up @entity3 's calls and will be in his role when @entity6 face @entity9 next week born in @entity6 , @entity0 made his professional debut with @entity32 in the late @entity33			1
he made only one appearance for the @entity35 and also played a handful of times for @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			0
he retired because of injury at 23 and later played for non-league @entity42			0
in 2006 he was appointed assistant academy manager at @entity38 having previously coached their youth team			0
two years later he moved to @entity45 as assistant to @entity47 before joining @entity49 ’s youth set - up , where he coached the likes of @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
he left in 20013 before taking up his role as a @entity1 match delegate			2
and in a further twist , we can reveal that @entity6 will cite evidence from a match in which @entity0 was the assessor when they bid to overturn @entity25 's red card from saturday 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity7 at @entity62			1
@entity22 was furious with @entity3 after he felt his side deserved two penalties in the first half and that @entity24 should have been sent off for kicking out at @entity66			0
but it was @entity3 's failure to punish @entity24 for his high tackle on @entity25 which led @entity22 to label the challenge ' criminal '			1
@entity25 was red carded when he retaliated by shoving the striker and now faces a three - match ban			2
@entity6 have appealed the suspension which starts with the @entity28 final this weekend			0
they are expected to point to @entity76 's successful appeal over @entity78 's dismissal following his reaction to a dangerous challenge from @entity82 's @entity81 on @entity83			1
ironically , @entity0 ' report was used in that instance			0
@entity24 catches @entity66 with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute @entity66 fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of @entity92 @entity6 may point to @entity78 's appeal as they look to overturn @entity25 's sending off - @entity0 report was used in the game between @entity82 and @entity76 but the former @entity49 academy coach is sure to have upset @entity22 after reporting that @entity3 was correct in each of his key decisions at the weekend			1
on the first penalty claim in the 32nd minute for a handball by @entity92 , @entity0 – who had access to tv replays - wrote in his report : ' correct decision as ball hit with pace from close range and did n't see it as deliberate			2
' before half - time @entity6 appealed for another penalty when @entity108 went down after a challenge by @entity110			0
@entity0 wrote : ' both in real time and on dvd my opinion is that @entity108 is looking to go down as soon as contact is made			0
however , @entity110 does put his hands on him so appreciate your thoughts ! ! also to note , ref ca n't actually see @entity110 's hands on @entity108			0
' @entity121 / officialburnleyfc @entity3 was heavily criticised during and after the game as @entity6 drew at home to @entity7 on saturday on the @entity25 sending off and @entity24 challenge , he returned : ' in super slow mo it obviously looks awful , but in real time live and dvd @entity24 catches him as follow through from the challenge			1
( does @entity24 mean to harm him ? - only he knows ) also , looks worse because @entity25 has his foot planted … ' @entity0 , meanwhile , was also on duty during the controversial 2 - 2 draw between @entity82 and @entity133 in november , a match in which @entity129 had a goal ruled out after @entity135 's two - touch free - kick – which led to the goal - was correctly deemed in breach of the rules .			1
