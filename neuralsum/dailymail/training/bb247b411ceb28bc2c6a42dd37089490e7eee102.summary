by @entity0 @entity3 firms who do not export to the @entity5 should be freed from the most burdensome @entity7 regulations , hundreds of business leaders will say today			1
business for @entity3 , a @entity10 campaign group representing 800 business leaders , will propose that only the five per cent of @entity3 companies who trade with the @entity14 should be subject to the rules of the single market			1
it says reform should form a centrepiece of @entity3 ’s demands for a looser relationship with the @entity5 in a renegotiation of membership promised by @entity24 ahead of an in / out referendum if the @entity26 win the next election			2
business for @entity3 will propose only five per cent of @entity3 companies who deal with @entity30 should be subject to rules of the single market ( library image ) though it is far from clear that other @entity5 member states would countenance such an opt - out , the plan is winning considerable support among @entity38 , including former @entity30 minister @entity39 and former cabinet minister @entity40			1
under the so - called ‘ @entity42 ’ , @entity5 laws would continue to augment @entity3 business law , but @entity44 would approve a list of regulations that would not apply to companies and organisations that do not trade with the single market			1
the campaign group foresees the @entity3 remaining a member of a reformed @entity5 , ensuring that all companies that export to the @entity5 retain full access to the single marker			1
however , the majority of @entity3 firms would be freed from regulation estimated to cost them around £ 7.5 billion a year			1
they include the working time directive , limiting working hours , the temporary agency work directive , giving the same rights to temps as permanent staff , and the @entity5 climate change and energy package			2
the move would ‘ hugely benefit ’ jobs in the @entity3 and could be replicated across the @entity5 should other member states wish to compete more effectively , today ’s report says			2
the majority of @entity3 firms would be freed from regulation - thought to cost around £ 7.5billion a year @entity71 , chief executive of @entity72 , said : ‘ it is clear from our survey of the business community that they want a forward - looking relationship with the @entity5 based on trade rather than politics			1
‘ business leaders want access to the single market for the five per cent of firms that trade with the @entity5 , but they also want to make @entity3 more competitive in the global race and to ensure that we are better able to trade with the high - growth areas of the world			1
’ ‘ many different , often complex ideas have been advanced to improve or refine the single market in the @entity5 , but none have yet tackled the huge regulatory and financial burden it places on the 95 per cent of companies that do n’t even export to the continent			1
‘ by excluding these firms and organisations that do n’t need access to the single market from the most burdensome aspects of @entity5 regulation , the government would , at a stroke , better position @entity3			1
’ former @entity30 minister @entity39 is thought to be one of many behind the proposals mr @entity39 , a former @entity30 minister , said : ‘ this is a very good proposal			0
i ’d vote to leave the @entity5 if we get no change			0
if we achieve this , it would make me change my mind			0
‘ if the people who run @entity30 want to hold it together , they should be giving this very serious consideration			0
it wo n’t just appeal to the majority of @entity3 businesses who do n’t access the single market , but big majorities of businesses in most successful countries across the @entity5			1
’ former conservative cabinet minister mr @entity40 said : ‘ i think this is a brilliant idea			0
it would solve overnight the problem of small businesses and @entity30 regulation			0
we ca n’t have a situation where the tail wags the dog			0
’ @entity131 , @entity26 mp for @entity132 and @entity133 , said : ‘ this win - win proposal would be a major boost to @entity3 ’s small businesses and rising global exports , whilst recognising the reality that @entity5 rules cover @entity5 trade			2
the government should look closely at the idea			0
we will need creative thinking like this , if we are to navigate a path to a successful renegotiation of @entity3 membership of the @entity5			2
’ but @entity154 , of the @entity156 campaign group @entity155 , said : ‘ these proposals would amount to a bureaucratic nightmare			0
while there is always scope for reducing the regulatory burden for businesses , these proposals would scupper the single market , which is based on the principle that anything legitimately put on the market in one member state may be put on the market across the whole @entity5			1
‘ this would be a disaster for our @entity5 exports which account for 14 per cent of our gdp and small businesses looking to expand through exporting into @entity30 would face the double burden of complying with both @entity3 and @entity5 regulations			2
’ @entity170 general secretary @entity169 said : ‘ this is just another attempt to take away people ’s rights to paid holiday leave , health and safety at work , fairness and equality			0
it would take away basic employment rights – as well as protections like food safety and consumer rights – from everyone except the chosen few in @entity3 ’s export industries			0
‘ it would create a two - tier economy with reams of bureaucratic red tape			0
it ’s impractical , unworkable and unjust			0

business for @entity3 , representing 800 business leaders , made proposals
says only 5 *%* of companies who trade with @entity5 should be subject to single market rules
