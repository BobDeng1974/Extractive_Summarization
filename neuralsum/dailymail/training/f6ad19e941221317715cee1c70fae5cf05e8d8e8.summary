@entity0 are exploring the possibility of sending @entity2 to @entity3 as part of a £ 16million deal to sign exciting left back @entity6			1
@entity6 is training with @entity7 in @entity8 , having just arrived home from @entity3 ’s post-season tour of @entity11 and could play in his country 's friendly against @entity13			1
the 21 - year - old has been closely watched by @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 this season but after a bright start had some indifferent performances in the second half of the season			2
nevertheless , there is no doubting his ability and his age allows room for improvement			0
@entity27 : @entity0 have stepped up their efforts to sign @entity3 left - back @entity6 ( left ) on duty : @entity6 is training with the @entity7 squad in @entity8 ahead of the @entity31 on loan : @entity2 spent last season at @entity34 @entity0 have taken the initiative with an opening offer and are willing to use 20 - year - old unsettled midfielder @entity2 as a sweetener			1
the @entity7 @entity40 star had a successful loan spell at @entity34 last season and @entity3 are keen to help him put his career back on track			1
@entity0 continue to negotiate with @entity44 over midfielder @entity37 although his wage demands have taken them by surprise			1
leverkusen are one of the few clubs in the @entity50 that compete with @entity52 wages			0
@entity53 has been looking at signing a top class left back for more than 12 months and tried to bring @entity55 to @entity56 last august before he eventually brought @entity58 in on a season long - loan			1
academy graduate @entity60 ended up filling the role with distinction but he is naturally right - footed and will be moved across in time			1
@entity0 have also been considering @entity16 's @entity63 as an option			1
manager @entity53 is also ready to signal a move for @entity67 's @entity66 now that @entity68 has joined @entity67 from @entity69			2
@entity70 remains an option should @entity0 fail to sign @entity72			1
the 22 - year - old @entity74 international indicated he was ready to leave @entity75 telling 20 @entity76 : ' it 's clear that i can not continue like this			2
if nothing changes , i will have to make some changes myself			0
i want to play in the important games as well and not just in the @entity50			0
i do n't want to go through another year like this			0
hole : @entity0 experimented with @entity60 ( above ) and @entity58 at left back last season ' i only want to play for a major club			1
the @entity87 is important to me			0
we will see what happens			0
@entity90 would be an option			0
if i were to leave @entity75 , it will be for a foreign club			0
but it will have to be a club challenging for the title			0
' @entity0 have made a fresh enquiry about free agent @entity98 , 34 , but he is also considering a new offer from @entity100			2
@entity0 spoke to @entity98 in january but he was apparently upset when it became clear they wanted him as a squad player .			2

@entity2 spent last season at @entity34 , and @entity0 could offer him in deal
