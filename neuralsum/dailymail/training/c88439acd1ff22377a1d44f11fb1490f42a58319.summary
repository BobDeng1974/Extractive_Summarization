by @entity0 published : 16:16 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 19:32 est , 10 october 2012 @entity1 has come up with another excuse for his poor performance in last week 's presidential debate - he now says he was ' too polite ' towards @entity5			1
the president and his allies have suggested a number of explanations for his disappointing display , from mr @entity5 's surprise shift to the political center to even the high altitude of @entity14			2
but this morning mr @entity1 argued that his main problem was that he pulled his punches against the @entity18 candidate - and promised to be more aggressive in the two remaining debates			2
' i think it 's fair to say i was just too polite , because it 's hard to sometimes just keep on saying , " what you 're saying is n't true			0
" it gets repetitive , ' he told radio host @entity26 on wednesday morning			1
' governor @entity5 had a good night			0
i had a bad night			1
it 's not the first time , ' said @entity1 , who was speaking in his first televised interview since last week 's debate disaster			1
despite @entity5 surging in the polls following the debate , the ' fundamentals of what this race is about have n't changed , ' he said			0
the president also compared the debates to playing sport			0
' if you have a bad game you just move on , you look forward to the next one , and it makes you that much more determined , â€™ @entity1 told @entity35			1
yesterday @entity62 revealed that the president initially thought he had won last wednesday 's debate			1
however , over the next few days it became clear that the vast majority of the public and the media disagreed and judged mr @entity5 the winner by an overwhelming margin			0
on the up : @entity5 , pictured in @entity72 today , received a poll boost after his debate performance heavyweights : mr @entity5 campaigned with @entity77 's governor @entity76 in @entity78 , @entity72 on wednesday morning , mr @entity1 spoke to mr @entity26 in an attempt to explain what had gone wrong and how he would improve before the second debate on tuesday			1
the president avoided a number of lines of attack of which many observers expected him to take advantage , such as mr @entity5 's career at @entity90 or his controversial claim that 47 per cent of @entity92 are ' victims ' who are dependent on government			0
but mr @entity1 appeared to imply that he would not be so timid at next week 's event , as he said : ' i think it 's fair to say that we will see a little more activity at the next one			2
' he also predicted that mr @entity5 would run into trouble as a result of apparently changing some of his previous policies over the last few weeks			0
' governor @entity5 put forward a whole bunch of stuff that either involved him running away from positions that he had taken , or doubling down on things like @entity109 vouchers that are going to hurt him long term , ' the president said			0
relaxing : the two senior republicans on board mr @entity5 's campaign bus following a stump appearance allies : mr @entity76 was one of the first major figures to endorse the former governor of @entity118 mr @entity1 addressed the worries of his supporters who are concerned the debate could carry mr @entity5 all the way to the @entity45 , saying : ' by next week , i think a lot of the hand - wringing will be complete because we 're going to go ahead and win this thing			1
a top @entity129 aide yesterday blamed the president 's defeat on his own lack of interest in serious preparation for the debate			2
' president @entity1 made it clear he wanted to be doing anything else - anything - but debate prep , ' the @entity138 said			1
' he kept breaking off whenever he got the opportunity and never really focused on the event			0
' during the preparation period for the debate , mr @entity1 took time off to visit the @entity144 and also joked with a campaign volunteer that his advisers were ' keeping me indoors all the time ' and ' making me do my homework '			1
protection : the candidate with a group of motorcycle police who accompanied him in @entity14 retail campaigning : mr @entity5 's running mate @entity155 talks to a future voter and her mother after picking up a scoop of ice cream in @entity160 , @entity161 preparation : two students standing in for @entity164 and mr @entity155 in @entity165 , @entity166 , scene of thursday 's vice-presidential debate in his closing statement last week , the president said it had been ' a terrific debate ' , apparently indicating that he was happy with his own performance			2
it was only after talking to his staff and seeing the media coverage that he released how firmly the public perception had swung towards mr @entity5			0
the day after the debate , campaign chief @entity177 said the @entity1 camp would take ' a hard look ' at what had happened and would ' make some judgements about where to draw the lines in these debates and how to use our time '			2
he is understood to have taken charge of debate preparation and be planning on longer , more streamlined sessions with fewer people present .			0
