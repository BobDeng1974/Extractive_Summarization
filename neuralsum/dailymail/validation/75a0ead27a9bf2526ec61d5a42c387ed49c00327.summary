@entity1 star @entity0 wants to reward @entity3 's ' trust ' in him after a challenging few months on the international circuit			1
juggernaut wing @entity0 will win his 48th cap in saturday 's @entity8 showdown against unbeaten title favourites @entity9 at the @entity10			1
and the 22 - year - old 's impressive display when @entity1 beat @entity13 in @entity14 11 days ago suggests he is on the way back to recapturing top test match form			1
earlier this term , @entity1 head coach @entity3 called for @entity18 to increase his involvement in games , and it did not go unnoticed			1
@entity1 winger @entity0 collects a pass in training ahead of the @entity8 clash with @entity9 @entity18 is thankful for the ' trust ' that @entity1 coach @entity3 has shown in him in recent weeks @entity1 centre @entity26 ( left ) runs with the ball during a training session at the @entity30 scrum - half @entity31 catches the ball in training ahead of saturday 's @entity8 showdown with @entity9 ' for me , it 's never a good point if the head coach is not happy with you , ' @entity0 said			1
' that is when you start getting dropped and stuff			0
' i felt that @entity14 was a step forward for me to where i want to be in a @entity46 jersey , and hopefully on saturday i can push forward again and reward his trust			2
' @entity18 has only scored one try in his last seven @entity50 - against @entity52 last november - but at the @entity10 it is a strike - rate of seven touchdowns from 10 starts during the past 16 months			2
victory for @entity1 this weekend would keep them in the @entity8 title mix heading for an appointment with @entity59 in @entity60 next week , but recent history suggests that @entity9 occupy the box - seat			1
they have beaten @entity1 in each of the last two @entity8 campaigns , scoring an aggregate 56 points , while @entity67 's men are currently on an @entity69 record - equalling run that has realised 10 successive test wins			2
@entity18 is tackled by @entity72 's @entity71 ( left ) and @entity73 ( right ) during the @entity8 match ' if you look at @entity9 over the last couple of years in this fixture , they have just been clinical , ' @entity0 added			1
' over the past two years they have been very good at finishing games off			0
they take their chances when they can , and we have lacked that composure when it has come to the crunch			0
' they are 10 ( wins ) from 10 , which is unbelievable			0
' they have got a lot of confidence now , they execute their game - plan very well and they are a side that knows what they want to do and where they want to go , and everyone has bought into that ethos			2
' we do n't need to big the game up more than it is			0
it 's a massive game for @entity9 , going for the @entity103 , and for us it will be a great test match here in @entity105			2
' @entity0 ( pictured here in 2014 ) will win his 48th cap for @entity1 if he plays against @entity9 at the weekend @entity1 , meanwhile , will be captained by flanker @entity109 for the 34th time as he overtakes @entity112 ' @entity46 record , and @entity0 said : ' it 's exceptional for @entity109			1
' he is a quality player and leads from the front , and as a captain you can not ask for any more			0
' with someone like @entity109 it 's not necessarily what he says , it 's the actions he does			0
he is the kind of man who will never ask you to do something he would n't do himself			0
' in training , he is not someone who stands up and gives a 20 - minute speech and everyone gets up and starts screaming			0
' it 's more of a kind of chat that is to the point and is no more or no less than what it needs to be			0
' @entity1 flanker @entity109 will captain his country for a record 34th time against @entity9 on saturday			1

@entity0 is thankful to @entity1 coach @entity3 for his *selection*
@entity0 will win his 48th cap for his country against @entity9 on saturday
the 22 - year - old gave an impressive display against @entity13 last time out
@entity9 are favourites for the @entity8 title and are unbeaten this year
