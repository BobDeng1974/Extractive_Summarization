@entity0 claims he could yet return to international cricket - if @entity3 chairman @entity2 departed the scene			1
it is a fanciful scenario to suggest @entity0 , sacked by @entity6 eight months ago , could resume his career with his adopted country under any circumstances such is the vitriol contained in his autobiography , which went on general sale on thursday			1
but he has escalated his grievances to the very top in his latest interview to promote his book , in the @entity18			1
@entity3 chairman @entity2 sits alongside @entity0 as he is ' reintegrated ' in october 2012 @entity0 's released his autobiography this week giving his version of events in the last few years test matches matches : 104 innings : 181 runs : 8,181 high score : 227 average : 47.28 centuries : 23 half - centuries : 35 one - day internationals matches : 136 innings : 125 runs : 4,440 high score : 130 average : 40.73 centuries : 9 half - centuries : 25 @entity34 matches : 37 innings : 36 runs : 1,176 high score : 79 average : 37.93 half - centuries : 7 ' what would have to happen for me to be recalled by @entity6 ? ' he asks			1
' clearly , the boss would have to go			0
' @entity0 , who has already been highly critical of some of his former team - mates and former team director @entity46 in his book and in earlier promotional interviews , hints he is aware of a possible change of guard			2
' @entity2 would have to go , and i 've been hearing that could happen in the next few months , ' he said			2
' that 's all hearsay , you never know			0
if there is a change at the top , there is potential , but we will wait and see			0
' it was @entity2 who presided over the @entity63 - born batsman 's reintegration into the @entity6 team at an eerie press conference alongside @entity0 in @entity66 in 2012 , that came after a three - month exile imposed on him for sending ' provocative ' text messages about his own captain @entity71 to members of the @entity75 opposition during a home test series			1
@entity0 is equivocal about where the power lies at @entity3			1
' @entity2 pulls a lot of strings , ' he added			2
' in terms of cricket , i believe @entity46 pulls a lot of strings too			0
he has @entity2 in his pocket			0
' an @entity3 spokesman declined to comment on @entity0 's latest remarks			1
@entity0 : the autobiography includes @entity0 's account of a culture of ' bullying ' in the dressing room under @entity46 's regime and orchestrated largely by @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
@entity0 signs copies of his new book at @entity100 on thursday the batsman has dominated the headlines all week and seemed to be enjoying the limelight on thursday one of his grievances is the belief that certain former @entity6 team - mates were involved with a @entity108 account called ' @entity109 ' , which sought to poke fun at the batsman			1
@entity112 ( above ) said on wednesday night that he had been told three @entity6 players had access to a @entity108 account parodying @entity0 former @entity6 captain @entity112 revealed on wednesday night that he was told by the owner of the parody account , @entity116 - an acquaintance of @entity95 's - that @entity96 , @entity118 and @entity95 all held the password to it as well			1
@entity112 said he immediately informed the @entity3 about these allegations			0
@entity118 responded on thursday morning , writing on @entity108 that he did not have a password and was not involved in anything posted on the account			0
@entity96 denied any involvement too earlier this week , and @entity95 did so in an @entity3 statement in august 2012 - a fact soon reiterated by a spokesman for the governing body , who said : ' @entity112 raised concerns in the best interests of @entity134 cricket			2
' it was investigated immediately			0
we dealt with this two years ago			0
' the matter was brought to a close back then by @entity95 's statement via his employers , released two days before the final test of three against @entity63 at @entity142			0
@entity0 was omitted from that match because of the mobile messages he had admitted sending about @entity71			0
@entity95 's statement at the time read : ' following last night 's statement by mr @entity116 that he was responsible for creating a parody @entity108 account in @entity0 's name , i would like to confirm that i had no involvement in this whatsoever			2
' i met with the managing director , @entity6 , @entity154 this morning and assured him that i did not play any role in the creation of this account or provide mr @entity116 with any information regarding @entity0 or the @entity6 team			1
' as has been widely reported , mr @entity116 is a friend of mine - but we had no conversations regarding this issue at all , and i am pleased that he has now decided to close the parody account down			0
' @entity112 's conversation with @entity116 took place during the first test at @entity169 in july 2012			0
at the end of @entity95 's statement on august 14 , @entity154 added : ' having discussed this matter with @entity95 , i am fully satisfied that he acted in a professional manner at all times and did not breach any confidences regarding fellow @entity6 players			2
@entity95 ( right ) has denied that he had anything to do with the tweets mocking @entity0 ' @entity3 also accepts the apology mr @entity116 offered last night to the @entity6 team via his @entity108 account and his reassurances that no professional cricketers were involved in the creation of this site			1
' @entity116 has subsequently reiterated that fact			0
@entity0 traces many of the controversies of the latter stages of his record - breaking @entity6 career to the ' horrendous ' breach of trust and loss of respect he felt on being told his own team - mates were behind the parody account			1
he sets that context of disillusionment against the storm which erupted soon afterwards over the messages he sent about his captain			0
his reinstatement allowed him to become @entity6 's leading runscorer , and to play some of his finest innings			2
but in february , on his return home after the 2013 - 14 @entity207 debacle , the @entity3 announced he was no longer part of the national team 's plans .			1

@entity0 published his book , @entity0 : my autobiography , this week
batsman was exiled from the @entity6 side after last winter 's @entity207 *defeat*
@entity0 lifts the lid on what he sees as a bullying culture within the @entity6 dressing room but says he wants to play for his country again
in an interview with the @entity18 , @entity0 says he has heard rumours that @entity3 chairman @entity2 is set to step down
@entity0 believes that if that happens he could play for @entity6 again
