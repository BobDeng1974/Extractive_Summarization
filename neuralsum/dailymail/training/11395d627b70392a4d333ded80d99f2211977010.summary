the @entity1 government has been forced to hand over hitherto secret documents that expose the flaws of the euro - and the misgivings of @entity7 politicians - in the years before it became a reality			1
@entity10 news magazine made a successful request for the release of the euro files at a time when the odds on @entity16 quitting the common currency within 18 months rise to 75 per cent and the chances of a complete shattering of the eurozone have never been higher			1
born in 1998 and introduced across the continent four years later , the euro was always a time bomb waiting to go off			1
many of @entity26 's aides had huge doubts at the time - and pinpointed @entity28 as the weakest link			1
firefighting : the odds on @entity16 quitting the common currency within 18 months are now 75 per cent and the chances of a complete shattering of the eurozone have never been higher ' the documents from the @entity26 administration , kept confidential until now , indicate that the euro 's founding fathers were well aware of its deficits			1
and that they pushed ahead with the project regardless , ' said @entity10 when it broke the news of the great euro con trick on the people of @entity7 today			1
hundreds of pages of @entity1 government documents from 1994 to 1998 stated clearly that @entity28 - now one of the floundering southern @entity7 euro states - should not have been allowed to join			1
later on the files bring up another country that was poised for catastrophe : @entity16			1
aides warned @entity54 - who , along with @entity55 in @entity56 relentlessly drove the @entity58 onwards as a bulwark against future war - that @entity28 's austerity measures taken at the time were merely ' window dressing			2
' early doubts : newly released documents say that before the euro currency was introduced in 1998 many of @entity1 chancellor @entity66 's ( pictured ) aides had raised concerns @entity10 dubbed the information in the files as ' @entity71			1
' the @entity1 seemingly knew they were driving the continent into a fiscal cul - de - sac but went ahead with it @entity76 february 3 , 1997 , the @entity72 noted that in @entity78 ' important structural cost - saving measures were almost completely omitted , out of consideration for the social consensus			0
' on april 22 , speaker 's notes for the chancellor stated that there was ' almost no chance ' that ' @entity28 will fulfill the criteria			0
' on june 5 , the economics department of the @entity88 reported that @entity28 's growth outlook was ' moderate ' and that progress on consolidation was ' overrated			0
' @entity92 , a man who later became @entity1 president but at the time was the @entity1 chief negotiator in the @entity97 negotiations , concluded that @entity28 had not fulfilled the conditions ' for permanent and sustainable deficit and debt reduction , ' and that it posed ' a special risk ' to the euro			2
' the documents that have now been released suggest that the @entity26 administration misled both the public and @entity1 's @entity106 , ' said @entity10			1
the paperwork comes at a time of rising dissent in @entity1 among workers that it has become the banker for more profligate nations			0
not a convert : hundreds of pages of @entity1 government documents from 1994 to 1998 stated that @entity28 should not have been allowed to join the common currency they show @entity54 desperately wanted to believe that @entity28 was ' cleaning up its act ' even when his own advisers told him it was n't			2
on april 3 1990 the @entity1 embassy in @entity78 warned that the risk @entity28 represented to fiscal harmony should ' not be ignored			0
' three months later , when @entity28 had secured its participation in the euro , @entity28 admitted its bookkeeping was less than exemplary and that reforms planned at @entity128 had not been reached			2
@entity10 added ; ' the message the documents convey is that political opportunism will ultimately prevail			2
a monetary union amounts to more than shifting several billion euros back and forth			0
it is also a community of fate			0
shared money requires shared policy and , in the end , shared institutions			0
' the euro is now in its 14th year , and after two years of ongoing crisis , there is a growing realization in @entity145 and other capitals that the status quo can not continue			0
all reform efforts still resemble small steps to nowhere			0

documents **highlight** concerns raised by @entity26 aides before euro was introduced
files produced before 1998 also **highlight** @entity16 as a ' *potential* catastrophe '
