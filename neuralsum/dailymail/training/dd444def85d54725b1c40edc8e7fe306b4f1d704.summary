' ' the cumulative total number of deaths in @entity8 is 3,145 , ' it said , down from friday 's figure of 4,181			2

when the agency gave its previous toll of 6,928 deaths on friday , up from 5,674 two days earlier , it put the steep hike in @entity8 fatalities down to ' a reconciliation of historical numbers ' and not to new deaths in recent days			2
it came as @entity45 was declared free from @entity2 , according to the @entity3			1
no new cases have been reported since nurse @entity47 , tested negative and was released from hospital			1
since then , 42 days have passed - double the incubation period for the virus - without another case , allowing officials to declare the country @entity2 - free			1
@entity45 authorities had been monitoring 87 people who came into contact with healthcare worker @entity47 , 15 of whom were considered high - risk and were quarantined at a @entity58 hospital , @entity3 said			2
' an error ' in the number of deaths attributed to the virus in @entity8 was blamed for the miscalculation it came as the @entity3 declared @entity45 free of @entity2 , it having been 42 days since nursing assistant @entity47 tested negative for the virus having overcome the disease in addition 145 hospital employees who helped care for ms @entity69 during her stay at the @entity71 , were monitored			1
the @entity3 statement said it ' commends @entity45 for the measures put in place to identify potential cases and prevent further transmission of the ebola virus			2
' ms @entity69 contracted the disease while helping care for a missionary who was brought back from @entity18 but died			0

there have also been 15 fatalities in other countries , bringing the total to 6,002			0
also on monday , the @entity3 said ' meaningful progress ' had been made towards reducing the spread of @entity2 by isolating patients and burying bodies safely			0
but assistant director - general @entity96 said that a target for 100 percent isolation of patients and 100 percent safe burials by january 1 will be ' challenging ' to meet			0
he warned that in @entity8 there were signs of ' a sense of complacency setting in ' .			0
