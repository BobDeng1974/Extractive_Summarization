a federal judge on tuesday refused to dismiss a case that could fatally cripple the @entity3 health insurance law			1
the @entity3 forbids the federal government from enforcing the law in any state that opted out of setting up its own health care exchange , according to a group of small businesses whose lawsuit got a key hearing monday in federal court			1
the @entity18 administration , according to their lawsuit , has ignored that language in the law , enforcing all of its provisions even in states where the federal government is operating the insurance marketplaces on the error - plagued @entity25 website			1
thirty - six states chose not to set up their exchanges , a move that effectively froze @entity29 out of the authority to pay subsidies and other pot - sweeteners to convince citizens in those states to buy medical insurance			2
but the @entity36 overstepped its authority by paying subsidies in those states anyway , say the businesses and their lawyers			2
tea party conservatives have long pushed for an end to @entity3 , and the lawsuit might give them the victory they 're after the @entity36 has been offering tax incentives to citizens in all 50 states to get them to enroll in @entity3 , the plaintiffs say , although the @entity3 forbids it in the 36 states that have opted out			1
without the subsidies , the employer mandate does n't go into effect the subsidies serve as a trigger that determines who has to comply with the now - famous individual and employer mandates			0
so , the lawsuit claims , the @entity18 administration illegally enforced the @entity3 – suddenly making millions of taxpayers and small employers subject to paying fines if they do n't play ball			1
the @entity3 authorizes subsidies only for policies purchased ' through an exchange established by the @entity67			0
' a different section of the law empowers the federal government to set up its own exchanges for each state that chose not establish one			0
but government lawyers have argued that ' @entity75 made clear that an exchange established by the federal government stands in the shoes of the exchange that a state chooses not to establish			2
' the @entity82 , they contend , ' has reasonably interpreted the @entity83 to provide for eligibility for the premium tax credits for individuals in every state , regardless of which entity operates the exchange			0
' but that amounts to the federal government ignoring the letter of the law , lawyer @entity90 says			0
and ' without those subsidies , the employer mandate is n't triggered , ' he told @entity97			0
and that could make the entire @entity3 system unsustainable			0
@entity101 secretary @entity100 is the named defendant in the legal action , which claims her agency is ignoring 36 states ' desire to opt out of enforcing the @entity3 oops : president @entity18 appeared with 13 @entity3 supports monday in the @entity108 rose garden , but only three of them have actually enrolled in the health insurance exchanges @entity90 is general counsel for the @entity113 , a free - market think tank that is coordinating the case			1
attorney @entity90 says the federal government is illegally subsidizing health insurance in all the states that chose not to set up their own health care marketplaces			2
and without the subsidies , the entire @entity3 system could fail ' the @entity36 can not rewrite the law that @entity75 passed , ' said @entity122 , resident fellow at another think , the tank @entity125			1
' its regulation expressly flouts the statutory text of the @entity3 , the intent of @entity75 and the reasoned choices of [ 36 ] states			1
' ' the fiscal impact ' of denying the @entity3 system millions of dollars in lost fines , ' while sizable , would n't be large enough to bring down the house , ' @entity90 added			0
the poltical one , however , is			0
' ' you 'd have 34 " refusenik " states exempting their employers and many of their citizens from the employer mandate and portions of the individual mandate , ' he explained			0
' you 'd have companies in participating states considering whether to move their operations ' to states where they do n't have to obey the @entity3			2
' and you might even have some of those states seeking to undo their choice to participate			0
' headaches : the @entity3 website has suffered glitch after glitch since its october 1 launch , creating pr problems for the @entity108 and practical problems for the @entity101 and @entity36 the @entity113 said in a statement that the @entity36 and the @entity101 have pushed regulations that @entity75 did n't authorize , forcing some employers ' to cut back employees ' hours ' in order to dodge @entity3 's more economically challenging requirements , ' even though they are located in states that have refused to set up their own insurance exchanges			1
' @entity169 district judge @entity168 refused to dismiss the case , as the government requested , but also denied the plaintiffs ' request for a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the @entity36 and @entity101 from granting subsidies in what lawyer @entity90 calls ' refusenik ' states			1
this @entity179 company says complying with the @entity3 law is forcing it to let some employees go and trim others back to part - time hours to offset the cost of the employer mandate -- a provision that would n't kick in without the @entity36 subsidies judge @entity168 said tuesday that he will rule on the merits of the case by february 15			1
by then the @entity3 law will be in full swing , nearing the end of its open enrollment period and providing health care services to @entity169 who sign up for coverage by december 15			1
@entity90 said his organization would ' take an immediate appeal to the @entity198 ' in order to get a re-hearing on the motion for an injunction to stop the clock on @entity3 while the larger legal issues are worked out			2
at the lawsuit 's heart is a set of distinctions that @entity75 drew between the 14 states – 15 including the @entity29 – that chose to establish health insurance exchanges and the 36 that opted out			1
the plaintiffs , who all hail from ' refusenik ' states , say the federal government has invalidated their state governments ' choices			2
@entity90 said that the @entity3 statute does not empower the @entity36 or @entity101 to ' give subsidy funding to people in states not authorized by @entity75 to receive it			1
that move , he agreed , had he effect of ' gutting a choice – to participate in the exchange program or not – that states were given by @entity75			0
' the government is ' asking you to interpret " north " to mean " south , " ' plaintiffs ’ attorney @entity231 told @entity232 on monday			0
the @entity108 referred questions about the lawsuit to the @entity235 , which declined requests for comment and passed the buck to the @entity239			0
the @entity239 did n't respond to emails seeking a position on the lawsuit , which its lawyers are defending .			0

small - business plaintiffs say the government is treating all 50 states the same even though @entity75 allowed them to opt out – and 36 did
the @entity36 is granting insurance subsidies to taxpayers in the ' refusenik ' states , even though the text of the @entity3 law does n't allow it
a federal judge denied the government 's motion to dismiss the case on tuesday
he also refused , however , to issue an injunction barring the @entity18 administration from implementing the law while the case moves *forward*
