by @entity0 published : 13:13 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 13:16 est , 3 december 2013 a teenager suffers from a condition that she says makes her look like she is nine months pregnant every time she eats			1
@entity4 has a problem with her digestive system which means her stomach swells and leaves her in tremendous pain			1
the 19 - year - old was diagnosed with abdominal adhesions - bands of fibrous tissue between her organs - earlier this year			1
@entity4 , 19 , has a problem with her digestive system which means she says she looks nine months pregnant every time she eats every time she eats her stomach balloons so much that people think she is pregnant			1
she has now been in @entity20 since october and doctors do n't know what to do to treat her problem			1
@entity4 , of @entity24 , said : ‘ my weight 's gone up and down in a very small space of time			1
‘ i put on weight after surgery , but it did get down to six stone at one point because i could n't eat			0
‘ my mum could n't bring herself to look at me			0
‘ but every time i do eat , i look about nine months pregnant			2
somebody in the hospital canteen actually asked me how far along i was			2
@entity4 has abdominal adhesions - bands of fibrous tissue between her organs - which cause her extreme pain ‘ i did n't even know what to say			1
i felt so awful that i lied			0
it feels as though my stomach is about to stretch open			1
’ @entity4 's problems began when her stomach suddenly swelled overnight and she was rushed to hospital on april 28			1
she had various tests and scans but doctors could not determine what was wrong			2
the teenager was released from hospital a few days later after she seemed to get better			2
but the crippling pain and swelling came back and she was readmitted later in the week			0
after a range of tests could not show what was wrong , an investigative operation in july finally revealed @entity4 was suffering from adhesions , bands of fibrous tissue , on her bowel and appendix			1
they were removed and @entity4 , who worked as a supervisor at clothes shop warehouse before she became ill , returned home			1
but her symptoms soon began to resurface			0
she said : ‘ originally the adhesions were intertwined and were cut out			0
‘ they were causing an obstruction in my bowel and my organs were struggling to move about			2
‘ everything was just fantastic and i started eating again			0
i went home and was looking forward to returning to my course			0
‘ but it did n't last long and i never got back to anything			0
i was put on different medications and even tried nerve - blocking injections , but nothing seemed to help			2
‘ then eventually about eight weeks ago , i was taken back into hospital			2
’ doctors have been at a loss with what to do , fearing that more investigative surgery could make her problems worse			1
@entity4 said : ' every time i do eat , i look about nine months pregnant			1
somebody in the hospital canteen actually asked me how far along i was ' due to the seriousness of her condition , @entity4 has now been in hospital since october , but she vows to remain positive			1
she said : ‘ unfortunately , now a little down the line we are back to square one			0
we believe that the adhesions have returned and are day by day possibly causing damage to my bowel , stomach , gallbladder and fertility organs			1
‘ i am unable to eat much and am deteriorating again			0
we are losing faith in the @entity108 doctors and in the care that i am receiving here in @entity20			2
‘ you have to keep your spirits up , but it 's difficult			0
i 've managed with my mum to get into town in a wheelchair a few times			0
‘ i go clothes shopping , even though i ca n't wear them because my stomach swells so much			1
’ @entity4 had to leave her photography course at @entity121 because she has missed classes through her illness			1
@entity4 had surgery to remove the fibrous bands in her stomach but they soon returned and they are now threatening her reproductive organs - she fears she may have to have a hysterectomy and she also had to turn down a place at @entity132 to study fashion buying			1
but she is now trying to raise money for specialist treatment which she hopes will give her back her life – and she wants to train to be a midwife			1
she said : ‘ i 've missed out on so much			0
i see photos on @entity139 of all of my friends out enjoying themselves			0
it 's heart - breaking			2
‘ after being in hospital now though , i want to be a midwife			2
i do n't want to waste time			2
‘ getting the right treatment would give everything back to me and my family			2
i want to start 2014 afresh			0
’ @entity4 is hoping to raise enough money to pay for treatment from a private adhesions specialist in @entity152 , who would have the expert knowledge to investigate			1
surgeons in @entity20 have run out of options for treating @entity4 - they fear if they perform another operation it will make the problem worse generous friends and family rallied round and have already raised almost £ 2,000 in just two days			1
@entity4 said : ‘ i ca n't believe how supportive everyone has been , especially in december			1
‘ it was a last chance thing and it 's given me so much hope			0
’ if the tissues inside the body become injured , the immune system triggers a response that involves forming bands of scar tissue , called adhesions			1
this usually occurs after surgery			0
most of the time , the adhesions do n't cause any problems			2
however , sometimes the scar tissue can cause the bowels to stick together			2
this can cause it to become partially blocked - this causes pain and vomiting			0
adhesions can also pull the fallopian tubes out of place causing infertility			0
causes of adhesions include appendicitis , endometriosis , an infection and @entity194			0
the main forms of treatment are surgery and painkillers			0
source : @entity200 in @entity152 , a barrier mechanism would be inserted to help prevent the adhesions from returning and hopefully allow @entity4 to carry on with a pain - free life			1
the teenager believes that the adhesions formed and attached themselves to her bowel and appendix after she suffered from appendicitis			0
they normally develop in patients after they have had surgery , but doctors believe that @entity4 was born with the condition			1
she said : ‘ my stomach does n't empty fast enough so it just swells up			1
i can eat little things like snacks but when it 's really bad i can barely even take in water because i just feel sick			0
‘ other people i have spoken to [ with the condition ] are having to get hysterectomies because the adhesions have spread so much			0
‘ the pelvic pain i have is really severe and we 're worried about mine			0
‘ we found out online that when you have them congenitally that there 's 93 per cent chance of them coming back			0
’ @entity4 now wants to raise as much money as she can in the hope that she can travel down to @entity152 for the surgery next year			1
the cost of the surgery and all the tests involved will be about £ 4,000			0
to support @entity4 visit @entity236			1

@entity4 has bands of fibrous tissue between her organs - each time they 're removed they return and are threatening her reproductive organs
