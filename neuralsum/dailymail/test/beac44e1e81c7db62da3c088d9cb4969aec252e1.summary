president @entity0 proved he is very popular in @entity1 on thursday			1
crowds across the country cheered for president @entity0 as he made multiple stops and became the @entity7 president to visit the island nation since president @entity9 in 1982			1
and it seems no one was more excited , or starstruck , than @entity1 prime minister @entity12			1
well , first of all i can say to you publicly , ' i love you			0
'' @entity12 said she hoped @entity0 understood how important his visit is to @entity1			2
' it is a great pleasure to visit @entity1 , known for its beauty and the extraordinary spirit of its people , ' @entity0 wrote as he signed the guest book at @entity29 , where the prime minister and her staff have offices			1
' may the deep and abiding friendships between our nations continue for generations to come			0
' @entity1 sprinters @entity38 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) watched president @entity0 as he spoke at a town hall @entity1 's leader also asked president @entity0 to exonerate black nationalist leader @entity42 , who was convicted in the @entity7 of mail fraud in the 1920s			1
prime minister @entity12 says she told @entity0 that it is the ' deep desire of the government and people of @entity1 ' to have @entity42 exonerated of the @entity7 criminal conviction that got him deported to @entity1 in 1927			1
she says she asked @entity0 to ' consider the matter and to offer any support within his authority			0
' @entity42 was the first person named a @entity1 national hero following the island 's independence in 1962			0
@entity0 arrived in @entity1 late wednesday			2
he met with @entity12 and other @entity57 prime ministers thursday before departing for the @entity58 in @entity59			1
he is off for another historic meeting there , this time with @entity63 's president @entity62			1
what 's more , president @entity0 signaled thursday he will soon remove @entity63 from the @entity7 list of state sponsors of terrorism , boosting hopes for improved ties as he prepared for his encounter with president @entity62			1
president @entity0 signaled thursday while speaking in @entity1 he will soon remove @entity63 from the @entity7 list of state sponsors of terrorism many at the town hall in @entity1 cheered and screamed ' i love you ' as president @entity0 spoke president @entity0 said the @entity74 had finished its review of @entity63 's presence on the list , a stain on the island nation 's pride and a major stumbling block for efforts to mend @entity7 - @entity63 ties			1
a top senator confirmed that the agency had recommended removing @entity63 from the list , all but ensuring action by the president within days			2
' we do n't want to be imprisoned by the past , ' said president @entity0			2
' when something does n't work for 50 years , you do n't just keep on doing it			0
' with his optimistic assessment , @entity0 sought to set the tone for the @entity7 and @entity63 to come closer to closing the book on more than a half - century of estrangement , when he and @entity62 come face to face at the @entity58			1
@entity0 arrived thursday evening in @entity99			2
the highly anticipated interaction with @entity62 will test the power of personal diplomacy as the two leaders attempt to move past the sticking points that have interfered with their attempt to relaunch diplomatic relations			0
last night secretary of state @entity107 met @entity63 foreign minister @entity108 in a @entity99 hotel conversation : @entity107 and @entity108 talked for at least two hours , sitting across from each other in a restaurant - bar in the hotel fronted by large glass windows			1
the @entity7 government said the meeting went well last night secretary of state @entity107 met @entity63 foreign minister @entity108 in a @entity99 hotel			1
the two men talked for at least two hours , sitting across from each other in a restaurant - bar in the hotel fronted by large glass windows			0
the @entity7 government said the meeting went well			0
' secretary @entity107 and @entity63 foreign minister @entity108 had a lengthy and very constructive discussion this evening			1
the two agreed they made progress and that we would continue to work to resolve outstanding issues , ' a senior @entity74 official said			0
during the talk , @entity107 at times gesticulated to @entity108 with his hands as security officials stood guard outside			2
the @entity7 has long since stopped actively accusing @entity63 of supporting terrorism , and @entity0 has hinted at his willingness to take @entity63 off the list ever since he and @entity62 announced a thaw in relations in december			1
yet @entity0 has stopped short of the formal decision amid indications that the @entity141 was reluctant to grant @entity63 's request until other thorny issues - such as restrictions on @entity7 diplomats in @entity146 - were resolved			2
@entity63 is one of just four countries still on the @entity7 list of countries accused of repeatedly supporting global terrorism ; @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 are the others			1
the designation not only offends @entity63 's pride but also restricts @entity146 's access to credit and financial systems			0
@entity63 president @entity62 ( above ) arrived in @entity59 thursday , where he will attend a dinner with president @entity0 on friday sen. @entity165 of @entity166 , the top @entity167 on the @entity169 's foreign relations panel , called the recommendation to delist @entity63 an important step toward forging a more productive @entity7 - @entity63 relationship			1
' the @entity7 has a unique opportunity to begin a fresh chapter with @entity63 - one that advances our national interests on the island and in the hemisphere , ' he said			0
yet while recent polling has shown broad support for the thaw in both @entity63 and the @entity7 , the change has attracted fierce opposition from many other members of @entity185 - especially those who represent the large @entity63 - @entity7 population in @entity187			0
house speaker @entity188 , @entity189 , said thursday there were ' serious questions ' about the wisdom of taking @entity63 off the list ' while this dictatorship , which practices repression at home and supports violence throughout the region , continues to hold power			0
' this year 's summit is the first to include @entity63 , and for @entity62 it 's a powerful opportunity to prove his country can be a responsible player on the world stage			2
president @entity0 arrives having amassed some goodwill in @entity206 by upending the @entity7 policy of isolating @entity63 , a policy that had irritated others in the region , and by loosening immigration policies at home			1
how much face time @entity0 and @entity62 will have at the summit was unclear			0
although no formal meetings were scheduled , the @entity141 said the two would surely cross paths			0
@entity0 and @entity62 shared a handshake in 2013 at @entity220 's funeral , a jarring image for those who still recall the levels of @entity7 - @entity63 antipathy during the @entity225			1
while in @entity59 , @entity0 was to meet friday with @entity59 president @entity226 and other @entity228 leaders			2
he planned to speak at a forum of @entity230 before joining other leaders for dinner at @entity233 , home to archaeological ruins dating to the 1500s			0
a visit to the @entity238 was also likely			0
in a nod to lingering @entity7 concerns about human rights and political freedoms , @entity0 is making a point to attend a forum bringing together both dissidents and members of the @entity63 political establishment			2
on wednesday , @entity62 supporters aggressively heckled a group of @entity63 dissidents at a civil society forum in @entity99 , drawing criticism from the @entity7 although taking @entity63 off the terror list would remove one major obstacle to warming relations , @entity0 acknowledged that progress has n't been as swift as some had hoped			1
both nations called in december for quickly reopening embassies in each other 's capitals - hopefully in time for the summit			0
that has n't materialized , in part due to disagreements about @entity7 diplomats ' freedom of movement in @entity146			0
the @entity7 sees those restrictions as an attempt to stifle dissent by limiting @entity7 ' interactions with @entity62 's political opponents			2
' they are proceeding as i expected , ' @entity0 said of the talks between @entity146 and @entity277			0
' i never foresaw that immediately , overnight , everything would transform itself			0

president @entity0 became the first president to visit @entity1 since president @entity9 in 1982 on thursday
prime minister @entity12 *gushed* over president @entity0 , at one point telling him ' i love you '
president @entity0 signaled thursday while speaking in @entity1 he will soon remove @entity63 from the @entity7 list of state sponsors of terrorism
this as he prepares to have dinner with @entity63 president @entity62 on friday at the @entity58 in @entity59
