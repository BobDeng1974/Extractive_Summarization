@entity0 had gone almost 15 months since his last appearance in the @entity2 but @entity3 thinks it was worth the wait			1
part of a @entity8 team boasting @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , and managed by @entity12 , @entity0 let in three against @entity13 that day in january 2014			1
yet on saturday , like a blast from the past , the 38 - year - old goalkeeper became the fourth oldest player to feature this season			1
he did so with gusto , earning a round of applause from his team - mates as he entered the dressing room afterwards			2
38 - year - old veteran goalkeeper @entity0 put in a confident display against @entity25 on saturday @entity0 had come on as a substitute after first - choice @entity8 goalkeeper @entity27 was injured @entity0 ' assured performance earned him plenty of praise from his team - mates as @entity8 won 2 - 0 @entity8 striker @entity31 scores his side 's opening goal against @entity25 at @entity34 's on saturday @entity31 runs to celebrate in front of the home fans as @entity8 take the lead against @entity25 @entity8 have benefited from more opposition own goals than any other @entity2 team this season ( 5 )			1
his appearance came in unfortunate circumstances			2
an injury to @entity27 's left knee that will almost certainly rule the goalkeeper out of @entity48 's internationals this month called for @entity0 to wipe the dust off his gloves			1
there is no reason to panic as far as @entity3 is concerned			2
he has a man he deems reliable and professional enough , both behind the scenes as club captain and on the pitch , to fill the void			2
@entity3 was 51 on saturday and , while @entity31 and an own goal from @entity25 's @entity62 provided the victory , the @entity8 manager 's birthday gift was in no short part down to the man 13 years his junior			1
' i was not surprised because we see @entity0 working every day in the training session , ' @entity3 said			2
' that 's important to have somebody when he has to play that he has some confidence			0
that he will not be nervous			0
' his situation is clear			0
@entity27 is first and @entity0 is the second goalkeeper			2
you need a lot of experience when you need to play and you have to show it			0
' that 's difficult but he showed his quality			0
he was looking very comfortable and that gave confidence to the rest of the team			0
he 's not the youngest goalkeeper but still he 's a very good goalkeeper			0
he 's a very good professional			0
' @entity25 's @entity62 ( left ) is put under pressure by @entity8 forward @entity86 on saturday @entity0 still has some way to go before catching @entity89 's 42 - year - old reserve goalkeeper @entity88 but he made the most appearances for @entity8 in @entity91 four seasons ago , having joined the @entity8 in 2006 , and rolled back the years on saturday			1
@entity0 denied @entity92 and @entity93 with full - length saves , and gave @entity3 hope that losing @entity27 will not hamper the club that have conceded the fewest goals in the @entity2 this season			1
@entity25 tested them , but @entity100 football remains a possibility			1
@entity3 was not oblivious to his former club @entity102 's win in the @entity104 against @entity105 last week , yet he refuses to imagine himself taking @entity8 to the @entity106			1
' we do n't think too much about the @entity104			0
we hope seventh place on the table means @entity100 football , and that will be fantastic for us , ' said @entity3			1
' the @entity104 is amazing to play in and amazing to be involved in			0
we know our situation , we know our qualities			0
if it 's @entity115 , that will be great for us			0
' @entity8 boss @entity3 is hoping to finish in the top seven in the @entity2 this season the 2 - 0 win over @entity25 leaves @entity8 in strong contention for @entity100 football next season			1

@entity0 made his first @entity2 appearance in almost 15 months
he replaced the injured @entity27 against @entity25 on saturday
the 38 - year - old put in a solid display as @entity8 secured a 2 - 0 win
@entity3 is targeting @entity100 football with @entity8 this season
