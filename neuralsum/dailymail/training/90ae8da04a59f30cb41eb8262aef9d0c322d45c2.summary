by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:09 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 02:50 est , 2 october 2012 the @entity4 - @entity3 aerospace giant which plans to take over @entity5 benefited from almost £ 56million of tax credits from the @entity8 government – while paying just £ 10.5million in tax			1
this is despite @entity11 raking in more than £ 3billion in revenues from its @entity8 operations during 2010 , according to corporate documents seen by the @entity16			1
they also reveal a complex global maze of 276 @entity11 offshoots , including a string of ventures based in tax havens , such as the @entity23 and @entity24			2
peanuts to the @entity25 : the @entity4 - @entity3 company attempting to take over @entity5 made £ 3bn in the @entity8 during 2010 , but paid just £ 10m in tax @entity11 , whose headquarters are in the @entity30 , also runs subsidiaries in the low - tax @entity32			1
the firm , which employs 17,000 staff in @entity8 , is currently in talks over a £ 31billion deal to merge with the former @entity38			1
the revelations have sparked fears that @entity5 ’s contributions to @entity43 coffers could dry up after it is folded into @entity11 , which owns @entity44			1
tax accountant @entity45 said : ‘ here ’s another example of a @entity8 company fleeing our shores for foreign ownership with the inevitable consequence that less tax will be paid in the @entity8			2
‘ we ’ll be paying for the fighter jets and they ’ll be making no contribution			0
it ’s time to change our tax system to make sure every company pays fair tax where it really earns its profits			0
’ ' public purse could pay a massive price ' : @entity11 , whose headquarters are in the @entity30 , also benefited from almost £ 56million of tax credits from the @entity8 according to its own accounts , @entity11 carves up its operations into subsidiaries , with each one a separately registered company			1
it boasts 31 such operations in the @entity8 – each one paying a different amount of tax			2
some have not updated their records since 2010			0
if all of its @entity8 arms were put together , the company made a pre-tax loss of £ 166million during 2010 in the @entity8 and received a tax credit of £ 46million			1
some divisions paid no tax at all , while many of the others paid less than full corporation tax , which in 2010 was charged at 28 per cent			0
documents filed at @entity86 show that @entity87 , its main @entity8 division employing 10,000 workers , made a £ 206million loss in 2010 despite making sales of £ 2.4billion			2
the firm received a generous £ 56million in tax credits from the chancellor , relating to a ‘ deferred tax credit ’			1
other divisions paid just a tiny amount of tax			0
predator : inside the model of a jet for space tourism designed by @entity11 , which employs 17,000 staff in @entity8 and is in talks over a £ 31bn deal to merge with the former @entity8 aerospace one , @entity106 , reported £ 5.5million in turnover and £ 66,000 in profits			1
but it contributed a miserly £ 254 to the taxman – a tax rate of just 0.003 per cent and the same as anyone earning £ 7,745 in @entity8 during 2010			1
another arm , @entity114 and @entity115 , made a pre-tax profit of £ 525,000 yet only paid £ 6,224 to @entity117			0
the @entity119 division , which deals with offices and services , had revenues of £ 23million yet made a loss of £ 1.5million			0
it paid just £ 14,000 in tax during 2010 relating to a prior year			2
other @entity8 arms also saw vast revenue streams evaporate into tiny profits			2
further afield , the @entity11 has a string of operations based in the @entity23 , which is renowned for its status as a tax haven			2
it is not believed that @entity11 has any material operations – such as assembly plants , factories or research facilities – there			2
@entity140 union boss @entity139 @entity11 has its corporate headquarters in @entity142 in the @entity30 , despite being part - owned by the @entity4 , @entity3 and @entity144 governments			1
it is not known whether the merged company , including @entity5 , would move its tax domicile there			0
@entity5 is currently registered in @entity147			0
in most large companies , some offshoots pay tax , others do not and some receive tax credits or refunds from the government , so money flows both ways between the firm and the tax authorities			1
@entity11 has 31 @entity8 subsidiaries but a number are holding companies and do not file accounts or pay tax			1
according to the latest figures available , firms based in the @entity8 paid a total of just under £ 10.5million in corporation tax in 2010			2
but the largest @entity8 business , loss - making @entity87 , received a tax credit of £ 56million			1
two military satellite subsidiaries received tax credits of just over £ 304,000			1
these credits far outweighed the payments made to the exchequer , meaning that overall @entity11 ’s @entity8 operations were nearly £ 46million to the good in their dealings with @entity117			1
painful reading : documents filed at @entity86 show that @entity87 , @entity11 's main @entity8 division employing 10,000 workers , made a £ 206m loss in 2010 despite making sales of £ 2.4bn @entity139 , of the union @entity140 , who represents the engineering and shipbuilding industry in @entity186 , said : ‘ the public purse could pay a massive price			1
‘ we need proper sound judgment from all the political parties so that they look after the nation ’s long - term interests			0
‘ caution should certainly apply to where the company is registered , how it is controlled and the taxation aspects , as so much of the skills needed for the defence of our nation are tied up with this firm			0
‘ the fear of mergers is that there will be downsizing and the public purse might have to pick up the tab for lost jobs as well			0
’ @entity209 , @entity210 ’s national officer for aerospace , said : ‘ we believe all companies should pay their fair tax			0
this raises questions that need to be answered			0
’ a spokesman for @entity11 in the @entity8 said : ‘ we pay tax in accordance with the laws of the countries in which we operate			1
’ he added that the group has created 4,000 @entity8 jobs since 2007 and is the largest exporter of commercial aircraft from @entity8			0
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - by @entity226 , deputy political editor wants merger : @entity228 has been dealt a serious blow in his attempt to see through the deal to merge @entity5 with @entity11 after a revolt by shareholders @entity228 ’s hopes of pushing through @entity8 ’s biggest defence deal were hit by a series of setbacks yesterday as anger spread about the threat to jobs and national security			1
shareholders staged a revolt over plans to merge @entity5 with @entity4 - @entity3 aviation firm @entity11 , demanding a say over the deal			1
in a further blow , @entity248 politicians said they will not back the deal unless they receive reassurances that @entity8 @entity5 jobs are safe and a guarantee the @entity254 will not ditch its defence contracts			2
senior government sources also warned last night that no 10 will have to fight proposals by @entity4 and @entity3 to grab a controlling interest in the new firm			1
the @entity261 has written open letters to @entity5 chairman @entity263 and sir @entity264 , its senior independent director , asking them to ensure that private investors in @entity5 can vote on the proposed merge			0
one mp in touch with the biggest personal shareholders said : ‘ they do n’t like the deal			0
they do n’t see the logic of it			0
’ @entity281 , policy co-ordinator of the @entity261 , added : ‘ to listen to politicians , one might think this proposed merger will be decided by governments , as there has been almost no reference to shareholders – those who actually own the business			0
’ he said it was ‘ shocking ’ that many private shareholders who keep shares in @entity286 and pension funds have no voting rights			0
security fears : in a further blow , @entity248 has demanded reassurances that jobs will be safe at @entity5 , which makes the @entity294 jet ( above ) the prime minister is supportive of the merger and officials had hoped it will be approved in the next couple of weeks			0
but now the @entity4 and @entity3 governments want the right to buy shares in @entity11 - something which is unacceptable to @entity304 , the @entity305 and the @entity306			1
a no 10 source said : ‘ we have very strict red lines and we are n’t coming off them			0
’ the government is backing the deal because it will allow @entity5 to win a foothold in the lucrative @entity315 defence market and the civil aviation arena			0
three sources in @entity3 familiar with the negotiations said last night that it was likely the deal would now collapse .			2

@entity4 - @entity3 firm @entity11 also took £ 56m in tax credits from @entity8
sparked fears tax contributions will dry up after merger
