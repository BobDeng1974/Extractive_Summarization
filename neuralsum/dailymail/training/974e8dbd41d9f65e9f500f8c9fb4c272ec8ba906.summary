by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 unveiled a new club crest on friday morning , with the design not incorporating the team name			1
the fresh logo features the tiger 's head which has been depicted on four of the club 's seven previous badges , but does not have the club 's name on it			0

update : @entity2 reveal their club crest for the 2014/15 season chairman @entity20 wanted to rebrand the club from @entity2 to @entity2 , citing the word city as ' common ' and claiming the club would be more marketable on the continent if known as ' @entity2 '			1
his wish was not granted by the @entity27 but the club continues to use the name @entity2 in statements and commercial operations			2
@entity20 had said he would appeal the decision - which came in april - but there has been no official comment since			2
@entity20 's son and vice-chairman , @entity36 , said the new crest , which has the club 's formation year of 1904 on it , helps celebrate @entity2 's history as they head into @entity42 football for the first time			1
@entity44 : chairman @entity20 has been fighting a long battle to change the name of the club to ' @entity2 ' heartache : manager @entity50 and @entity2 players on the pitch after their fa cup final loss to @entity53 in may ' this is a more stripped back and modern approach which still celebrates the club 's heritage and history by focusing on our famous and well established @entity59 's head , ' he said			1
' we have also introduced " 1904 " to the crest to document the year our club was formed			0
' our first ever step into @entity42 competition is a new era for us all and we are all excited about the season ahead			0
