by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 former @entity4 coach and @entity6 analyst @entity3 has blamed ' politically correct idiots ' for the controversy over the @entity10 ' name			1
there have been calls for the @entity14 team to change its name after complaints that ' @entity10 ' is an offensive or racist term for @entity18			1
but @entity3 does n't agree			1
' what 's all the stink over the @entity22 name ? ' he demanded during an interview with the @entity24			2
' it 's so much [ expletive ] it 's incredible			2
we 're going to let the liberals of the world run this world			2
it was said out of reverence , out of pride to the @entity18			1
' anger : former @entity4 player and coach @entity3 has said in an interview that he can not believe the controversy over the @entity10 ' name - insisting that the term was used out of pride for @entity18 he continued : ' i hope that owner keeps fighting for it and never changes it , because the @entity10 are part of an american football history , and it should never be anything but the @entity10			1
that 's the way it is			2
' he added that the controversy was due to ' the political correct idiots in @entity52 '			0
' it 's fine to protest , ' he said			0
' that 's your right , if you do n't like it , protest			0
you have a right to do that , but to change the name , that 's ridiculous			2
change the @entity61 - € ” we 've got people trying to do that , too , and they 're doing a pretty good job			1
' but not everyone agrees with him			0
on monday , two influential @entity69 voices - including @entity71 lead analyst @entity70 , who will handle @entity14 's @entity73 game - said they would not be using the name during broadcasts			1
' my very first thought is it will be " @entity14 " the whole game , ' @entity70 told @entity2			1
@entity79 will work the thursday night package the network acquired this season and will cover the @entity83 - @entity10 game on september 25			0
he said that he is n't taking sides in the debate over whether @entity14 's nickname is offensive or racist , but he says he is sensitive to the complaints about the name			1
decisions : @entity71 lead analyst @entity70 , left , said he will use ' @entity14 ' instead of ' @entity10 ' during broadcasts to respect the complaints			1
his broadcast partner @entity93 , right , said he will not take a stance ' i never really thought about it , and then it came up and it made me think about it , ' @entity70 added			0
' there are a lot of things that can come up in a broadcast , and i am sensitive to this			0
' his broadcast partner , @entity93 , says it is ' not my job to take a stance '			0
@entity110 's @entity109 , one of the most prominent voices in the league as a @entity114 - winning coach and now as a studio commentator , plans to take the same route as @entity70			1
' i will personally try not to use @entity10 and refer to them as @entity14 , ' @entity109 said in an email			1
' personal opinion for me , not the network			0
' support : team owner @entity122 has met with @entity18 who have supported the name @entity71 is allowing its announcers to decide on their own whether to call the team the @entity10			1
so is @entity127 , which handles the @entity128 and will televise most of @entity14 's games			1
' as long as their nickname is the @entity10 , i 'll continue to call them the @entity10 , ' said @entity135 @entity134 , the lead analyst for @entity127			0
@entity110 does not have any @entity10 games scheduled - the late - season flex scheduling could change that - but the team certainly will be mentioned on its @entity69 telecasts this season			1
the network said : ' for all of our sports properties , our on - air commentators have full discretion to reference participating teams by their city / region / state name , team nickname or both			0
' @entity6 said in a statement : ' we use the marks and nicknames as utilized by the teams , leagues and conferences we cover			0
' but several @entity71 announcers , appearing at a network news conference about its @entity69 coverage , said they will use the nickname			1
' that 's the name of their team and that 's what i am going to use , ' said @entity168 , a member of the @entity71 studio crew and also an analyst for @entity171 on monday night games			1
@entity173 said he will use ' @entity10 as long as that is what they are called			0
that 's their official name and i used it last year , two years ago , 10 years ago			0
' @entity179 , the @entity69 's mvp in 2002 with the @entity180 , spent one season playing for the @entity10			2
he now announces games for @entity71			2
uncertain future : the @entity10 are pictured during a game on monday against @entity185 ' there are so many @entity10 fans that take great pride in the name , ' @entity179 said			2
' ( @entity190 ) @entity122 has said he 's talked and visited with ( many ) @entity18 nations who are supportive of the name			2
and there are those who oppose it who are being heard			0
it 's an important topic			0
' the @entity10 ' nickname was the subject of a halftime essay by @entity110 's @entity202 last october when @entity14 played @entity203 on sunday night			1
in part , @entity202 said , ' think for a moment about the term " @entity10 " , and how it truly differs from all the others			0
ask yourself what the equivalent would be , if directed toward african - americans , hispanics , @entity213 , or members of any other ethnic group			0
' when considered that way , " @entity10 " ca n't possibly honor a heritage , or noble character trait , nor can it possibly be considered a neutral term			0
it 's an insult , a slur , no matter how benign the present - day intent			2

the former @entity4 coach lambasted people *wanting* to change the name , which is *deemed* a racial slur for @entity18
@entity3 said the name came ' out of pride to the @entity18 '
his interview comes after influential @entity69 voices on @entity71 and @entity110 said they would be using the name ' @entity14 ' on broadcasts instead
