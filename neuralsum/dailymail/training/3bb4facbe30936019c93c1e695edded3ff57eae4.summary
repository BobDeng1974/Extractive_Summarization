@entity12 said that the boys ' adoption was finalized in 2005 but it took nearly a year to finally get their hands on their files - and to discover the truth about the boys ' pasts			1
they were determined to provide the boys a home , but they also sought to protect their other six children , two of whom are biological			2
accused : the social workers ' supervisor @entity78 , left , has been named in the lawsuit			1

@entity11 and @entity12 claim that @entity14 social workers denied the two boys , then 11 and 15 , had been abused or had abused others
workers ' *refused* to hand over their files - which *detailed* the history of abuse - until after the adoption was complete '
when they learned the truth , they tried to protect their 6 other children by *locking* doors and monitoring the boys - but the abuse still went ahead
they have now filed the lawsuit on behalf of their 17 - year - old adopted daughter @entity27 , who was 9 ' when she was first abused by her brothers '
