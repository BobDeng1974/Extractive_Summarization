humans may have been a late arrival to a universe full of alien life , a new theory has claimed			2
@entity6 astrophysicist @entity5 believes that exoplanets warmed by radiation from the big bang may have been teeming with life just 15 million years after it occurred			1
the earliest evidence of life on @entity12 so far found dates from 3.8 billion years ago , around 700 million years after our planet formed			1
microwave radiation from the whole sky , captured by the @entity20 's @entity19 satellite revealing relic radiation , otherwise known as the @entity22 , created in the fireball of the @entity24 13.7 billion years ago			1
@entity6 astrophysicist @entity5 believes that exoplanets warmed by radiation from the big bang may have been teeming with life just 15 million years after it occurred			1
cosmic background radiation ( @entity22 ) fills the universe in every direction			2
it is the afterglow of the big bang streaming through space these last 14 billion years			1
it the oldest light we can see and the farthest back both in time and space that we can look			0
changes in the light emitted when the @entity42 was just 400,000 years old could helped scientists understand the structure and evolution of the universe			2
@entity48 researchers have conducted an extensive analysis of the thermal radiation left over from the @entity24 , also known as cosmic microwave background ( @entity22 ) radiation			2
their analysis supports the theory that the @entity24 occurred between 13.798 and 0.037 billion years ago , creating our subsequent @entity42			1
' when the universe was 15 million years old , the cosmic microwave background had a temperature of a warm summer day on @entity12 , ' he told @entity60			1
' if rocky planets existed at that epoch , then the @entity22 could have kept their surface warm even if they did not reside in the habitable zone around their parent star			0
' cosmic background radiation ( @entity22 ) fills the universe in every direction			0
it is the afterglow of the big bang streaming through space these last 14 billion years			1
experts have focussed their search for life in habitable zones around stars in areas known as the ' goldilocks zone '			0
these regions are considered to be just the right distance away from stars for liquid water , a pre-requisite for life as we know it , to exist			0
signs of life ? @entity86 - 62f , a super-earth - size planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun , located about 1,200 light - years from @entity12 in the constellation @entity92			1
@entity93 orbits its host star every 267 days and is roughly 40 percent larger than @entity12			2
the first planets would have been bathed in the warm @entity22 radiation , @entity5 argues it would have been possible for them to have liquid water on their surface for several million years			1
he says that one way to test his theory is by searching in our @entity104 galaxy for planets around stars with almost no heavy elements , which would mirror these early planets			0
' the feasibility of life in the early universe can be tested by searching for planets with atmospheric bio-signatures around low - metallicity stars in the @entity104 galaxy or its dwarf galaxy satellites , ' he wrote			0
' such stars represent the closest analogs to the Ô¨Årst generation of stars at early cosmic times			0
' a full - sky map of the oldest light in the universe			0
colors indicate ' warmer ' ( red ) and ' cooler ' ( blue ) spots			0
@entity128 has called this image the best baby picture of the @entity42 ever taken			0

exoplanets warmed by radiation from the @entity24 may have been teeming with life just 15 million years after it occurred
planetary *conditions* were ' temperature of a warm summer day on @entity12 '
earliest evidence of life on @entity12 so far found dates from 3.8 billion years ago , around 700 million years after our planet formed
