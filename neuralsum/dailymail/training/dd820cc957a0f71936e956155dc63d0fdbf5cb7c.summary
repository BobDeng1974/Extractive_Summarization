by @entity1 reporter two @entity3 joggers are lucky to be alive - and in one piece - after a scary run - in with a black bear on a trail in northeastern @entity8 last week			1
and just in case their friends do n't believe them , they have video proof showing the curious bear following the two men and in some cases getting within just a few feet of the terrified joggers			1
@entity16 and @entity17 were jogging in on a wooded trail in @entity19 on june 5 , when they bumped into a young black bear			1
the two men say they did what wilderness experts tell people to do when they are confronted by a bear -- but the animal refused to stop following them			1
' the moment that i met the bear it was an instant " turn around , do n’t make eye contact , walk away , " and that did n’t seem to work , ' @entity16 , who filmed the video , told @entity51			0
in the video , the bear is seen following the two men four about four minutes before they finally make a break for it			2
@entity16 and @entity59 say that it actually started following them several minutes earlier			0
' i was ready for him to pretty much pounce on me at any time , ' @entity16 continues			0
' for about three or four minutes i figured , what part of me is going to get gouged or ripped open ? ' he 's a climber : the bear would frequently climb up tress , climb down and then charge at the two men pursuit : the bear followed the two men for several minutes until they saw an opportunity to sprint to their jeep and took it the men yell at the bear and huddle close together to appear larger and hopefully scare the animal away			1
however , nothing seemed to work , and the bear continued to follow the men while occasionally climbing - and breaking - tree limbs and charging at them			2
' he was showing all he could do right there , as far as i ’m concerned , ' said @entity17			0
the men grabbed large rocks in case they needed to defend themselves if the bear attacked - as if the rocks would do much			0
too close for comfort : the bear would get within a few feet of the two men safety : the two men started tried to joke about the frightening encounter after sprinting back to the safety of their jeep when @entity16 and @entity17 saw a chance to run , they took it , and made it over a bridge and into their jeep unscathed - and with a wild story			1
' there were definitely some moments where our escape was not guaranteed in any way , ' @entity17 added			0
the men have since brought bear spray , which they now take with them whenever they job in the woods			2
however , they both say it will be a long time before they head back to that particular trail .			0

the two men were jogging on a path through the woods in @entity19 , @entity8 , @entity3
where the men encountered the bear is less than a mile away from where someone was killed in a bear attack in early may
the bear followed the men for several minutes as they walked backwards in the direction of their jeep
the bear repeatedly dips into the woods and then would emerge charging at the men
at many points , the bear is within feet of the two men
eventually , the men saw an opportunity to run and took it , *narrowly* escaping the *dangerous* animal
