the main quality about this hoodie that 's nicer is that it 's softer , so he 's really excited about that , ' she said , in an exclusive interview with today 's @entity18			2
he wears a fresh hoodie every day so that pretty much meets my lowest barrier for him ... i 'm happy with whatever he wants to wear , as long as it 's appropriate for where we 're going			1

however , @entity6 has been forced to defend the couple 's $ 100 million donation to @entity127 , @entity129 's public school system , with critics saying the money has so far failed to fix the city 's ailing school system			1
after four years , the money is nearly gone and a lot of people are angry			0
' we 've invested in @entity127 's children , the schools and teachers and these are long - term bets that need a number of years to really pan out , ' @entity6 , the eldest of three siblings , told today			1
' we 've seen and learned how important it is to listen to the community , and really get a sense of what they need and want			0
and it 's a long journey			0
