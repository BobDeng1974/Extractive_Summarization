from her show - stopping wedding gown and the dazzling dresses she wore as she adapted to her role as a royal , to her chic maternity choices while pregnant , the @entity6 was the world 's favourite style icon			2
but it seems that we 've had a change of heart as @entity13 , who has been showcasing her wardrobe choices week after week on the @entity15 , has pipped @entity6 to be crowned the most stylish woman			0
in fact , the @entity6 , who recently announced she is pregnant with her second child , is nowhere to be seen on the latest best dressed list			0
@entity21 's new style icon : @entity13 , who has been showcasing her wardrobe choices week after week on the @entity15 , has been crowned @entity21 's most stylish woman coming in at a close second after the @entity26 judge is @entity27 , as the nation celebrates the 20th anniversary of friends this month and the legacy of that haircut lives on			2
the sophisticated style of @entity34 and @entity35 has also struck a chord with women up and down the country , as has @entity40 ’s elegant look , ahead of her flagship store opening in @entity42 this week			0
other females to make the top ten includes @entity45 , @entity46 and even @entity6 's sister , @entity47			1
@entity40 ’s husband , the dapper @entity48 , is cited as the top style inspiration for men , pipping the likes of @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 to the post			2
contenders : coming in at a close second after the @entity26 judge is @entity27 , left , and mature style poster girl @entity34 , right , came in third place despite eschewing catwalk looks , @entity21 still look to paparazzi photos , celebrity street style and tv talent for inspiration , with over a third ( 37 per cent ) admitting that they buy outfits to copy celebrity looks , setting them back an average of £ 77 per outfit			1
perhaps a result of our celebrity - obsessed culture , young people are the most likely to emulate celebrities with over half of 25 - 35 year olds ( 52 per cent ) confessing to buying outfits to recreate a look they ’ve seen on a famous face			0
with the sun on its way out , and autumn on its way in , the fashion conscious will no doubt be looking to stock their winter wardrobes , with the average @entity85 set to splash £ 241 on clothes to keep out the cold			1
lost her touch ? @entity90 of @entity91 , left , would regularly top best dressed lists but she does n't even feature in the latest - but her sister @entity93 , right , took sixth place when it came to celebrity style most women want to emulate retailers will be celebrating the colder climes as 71 per cent of the @entity21 are set to buy a new coat this winter , while 80 per cent will stock up on jumpers , and 66 per cent will treat themselves to a new pair of boots			1
this compares to just over £ 100 spent on clothes for the spring / summer months			0
despite the reported rise of the metrosexual male , women still reign supreme on the high street , admitting to spending an average of £ 430 a year on new clothes and accessories just to stay up to date with the latest trends , compared to just £ 295 spent by men			1
when it comes to dressing their children , ten per cent of @entity114 are also looking to celebrity children for inspiration perhaps emulating the fashions of ultra-trendy @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			0
family style : @entity48 topped the best dressed men 's list whilst daughter @entity127 is inspiring ten per cent of brits looking to celebrity children for inspiration almost half parents aged 18 - 24 ( 45 per cent ) have looked to celebrity children , whilst almost a third ( 31 per cent ) have sacrificed their own fashion so their children can stay on trend			1
a spokesperson for @entity137 , who commissioned the research , said : ' as the biggest week in fashion draws to a close , it ’s interesting to see it ’s the wholesome household names rather than the world ’s sophisticated supermodels @entity114 are most likely to turn to for fashion inspiration			0
' brits are proud of our famous faces so it ’s no surprise that a third of us seek to emulate celebrity fashion looks , with the nations ’ sweetheart @entity153 and footballing legend @entity48 named the @entity21 ’s top trendsetters			2

*duchess* of @entity91 did n't make top ten this year
over a third of brits copy celebrity looks
they splash out £ 77 per outfit
women *splurge* £ 430 a year on new clothes to follow latest trends
@entity48 is men 's no.1 fashion icon
