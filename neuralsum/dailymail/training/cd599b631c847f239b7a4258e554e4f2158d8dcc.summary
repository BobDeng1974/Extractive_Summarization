by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:59 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:17 est , 21 december 2013 it 's the time of year when inevitably some ambitious people decide to ignore the @entity5 in favour of making their @entity8 gifts			1
armed with glitter , glue and hope , people will attempt a festive craft project to adorn their homes or present as a gift to their loved ones - but rarely does it go right			1
but for every successful attempt , there are hundreds of frustrated shrieks as people see their crafts collapse into a complete mess			1
what should have been a simple reindeer - themed snack resulted in @entity28 's face looking like it had melted @entity30 fail together : these sweet birds may look like they are happy to see you - but would you be happy to eat them ? and you thought your @entity8 jumper was bad : this woman decided to festoon a perfectly good top with some tinsel to make it extra festive unfortunately it did n't quite turn out how the original picture promised ... such is the failure rate , websites devoted to failed craft projects have become hugely popular on the internet - with people clamouring to share pictures of the appalling state of their work			1
@entity51 , creator of the @entity53 website , said that she was inspired to create her website - which showcases @entity56 disasters - after she found her own failures hilarious			2
she said : ' as a craft designer and blogger , i make a lot of things , and not all of them turn out well enough to share on my website			1
' one day it occurred to me how entertaining it would be if i could share the failures on a dedicated website , thus @entity70 was born			2
bird brain : these turkey cake pops look like the bird has been run over - but at least its beak is in tact @entity30 fail together : these sweet birds may look like they are happy to see you - but would you be happy to eat them ? ' now i 'm actually excited when a project does n't turn out ! i love sharing my failed crafts even more than my successful ones			0
' pity the poor person who attempted some seasonal - themed baking			0
delicate star - shaped cookies bloomed into huge blobs , while an attempt to make reindeer treats meant that the results looked like @entity90 's helpers faces had melted			2
another person attempted to make their own @entity8 baubles ; but the result looked like glass balls filled with slime			1
these snowmen look like they have been placed in front of the fire : these snowmen - shaped doughnut cakes may taste nice - but they do n't look appetising would you want these dangling from your tree ? a misguided attempt to decorate glass baubles ended up looking like balls of slime they were meant to be stars ! these biscuit blobs were initially intended to be delicate star - shaped treats ms @entity51 said that websites like @entity114 , which boast perfect craft projects , can be daunting for the novice crafter			1
she said : ' some of the projects are just as easy as the pins on @entity114 claim			2
some of them are n't as easy , and take some practice			0
' you wo n't always nail every project on the first try ; a lot of success relies on previous experience			0
' if you do n't have that experience , you might not succeed on the first try			0
this takes the biscuit : these turkey cookies do n't quite live up to the original project who wold live in a house like this ? this monstrous attempt is a far cry from the polished version that @entity138 made ' people should not be so hard on themselves if they are beginners to a certain type of project			1
' you ca n't expect to be a professional on the first try if you 've never even picked up a sewing needle before ! ' babies ca n't walk on the day they are born , and adults are n't always going to be successful with a new technique on the first day they try it			0
' also , be aware that bloggers and magazines know how to ' style ' their photos to look especially attractive and tempting			0
' your project might turn out just as well as theirs , but it wo n't be surrounded by a perfectly arranged background			0

novices attempt festive craft projects to offer as @entity8 gifts
many go *spectacularly* *wrong* as people *grapple* with new *skills*
websites now dedicated to showcasing the very worst creations
