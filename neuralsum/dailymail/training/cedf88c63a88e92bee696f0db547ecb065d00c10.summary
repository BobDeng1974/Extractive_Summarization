dozens of children were kept in a school hall and missed their lessons for their first day back at a city comprehensive - because they turned up wearing the ' wrong ' shoes			1
parents @entity7 and @entity8 from @entity9 , @entity10 , say their daughter , @entity11 , 13 , was among 30 pupils to be kept out of lessons for the day after she turned up to school in her usual black canvas footwear			1
@entity16 in @entity9 , @entity10 , insists that letters were sent out in july explaining trainers and ' daps ' - rubber - soled canvas shoes - were not acceptable			1
but @entity11 's parents claim they never received their copy			1
shoe ban : @entity11 , 13 , was among 30 pupils kept out of lessons for the day at @entity16 in @entity9 , @entity10 ' they were kept in the hall like prisoners , ' said shop worker mr @entity8			1
' @entity29 has been wearing shoes like that to school for the last two years			1
' she wore them in year seven and eight with no problem and we 've had no letter from the school or head teacher about it			0
' they said they 'd sent a letter but we had none			0
' he said his daughter told him that at the first assembly of the year last tuesday a teacher checked pupils and children with the wrong shoes			2
they were then taken to another hall , where they sat all day , except for dinner time			0
the case echoes other uniform crackdowns across the @entity59 this term			0
last week , around 100 pupils aged 12 to 16 were given their marching orders just minutes after turning up for the first day of term at @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , because their footwear were not ' black , leather shoes ' and were ' inappropriate '			1
the school , above , says letters were sent out in july explaining trainers and ' daps ' - rubber - soled canvas shoes - were not acceptable and sixty children were banned from classes on their first day for wearing the wrong trousers at @entity77 in @entity78			1
pupils as young as 11 were put in ‘ isolation ’ for up to seven hours because they did not adhere to a strict new uniform policy			0
@entity82 , 12 , who suffers from a foot complaint was forced to write ' decent people take pride in their appearance ' 40 times after turning up to @entity88 in @entity78 on monday , in the wrong shoes			0
in the latest case in @entity10 , @entity29 's mum claimed the school did not ring her or her husband at home or work			1
uniform rules : a section of the school 's uniform rules as shown on the @entity16 website ' it 's ridiculous			1
we know they ca n't wear trainers but these are black , lace up , canvas daps			0
she 's a very responsible 13 - year - old and she was very upset			0
we were not notified on the day and neither was our work			0
' @entity29 enjoys school and what annoyed her is she did n't know what she 'd done wrong			0
they were kept in a hall on a hot day			0
' headteacher @entity115 was not available for comment but in a statement the school said : ' the school , as with all other schools has a uniform policy to promote pride and identity among the pupils			2
sole reason : the rubber - soled shoes that the 13 - year - old girl wore to school ' all parents and carers were reminded at the end of the last academic year of @entity133 's school uniform policy which clearly states that black shoes and not trainers , daps , boots or sandals should be worn			1
' at the beginning of the current academic year there were a small number of instances of pupils not wearing the correct school uniform , including shoes			2
' in each case the school made attempts to speak to the parents so the situation could be rectified			2
' pupils were asked to sit in the hall while the school attempted to contact parents			2
' the hall is a bright , airy room with large windows and it is used for both assemblies and some lessons			0
' all pupils had access to all the facilities of the school as needed , including the school canteen , toilets , etc. we are glad to report that all pupils are attending all lessons			2
