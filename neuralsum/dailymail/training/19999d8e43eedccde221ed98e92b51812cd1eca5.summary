by @entity0 published : 19:23 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 19:23 est , 16 august 2013 @entity4 would impose rent controls ‘ without hesitation ’ if it won the next election , its housing spokesman @entity3 has been secretly recorded saying			1
his admission came eight days after @entity4 ’s biggest paymaster the unite union called for the party to adopt controls on what private landlords can charge			1
it brought claims that @entity18 , where mr @entity3 was deputy general secretary until 2010 , has ‘ bought ’ @entity4 policy			1
promises : @entity3 , pictured with his wife @entity21 , said that @entity4 would impose rent controls ' without hesitation ' if it won in 2015 rent controls have been tried by socialist governments , in particular , around the world but have been widely regarded as disastrous			1
however mr @entity3 , mp for @entity28 and husband of @entity4 ’s deputy leader @entity21 , said @entity4 wants to impose rent controls if it wins power in 2015			1
addressing a private @entity4 meeting last month , mr @entity3 admitted that it would be ‘ difficult in the 21st century to make traditional rent controls work ’ because it would lead to a ‘ loss of supply ’ of rental homes and ‘ deter investment ’ by landlords			1
but he said : ‘ should you have a form of rent control to end ever - spiralling upward rent , particularly here in @entity46 , yes without hesitation , yes without hesitation			0
’ suspicious words : mr @entity3 's words came just one week after his party 's biggest contributors , unite , had called for the party to adopt controls on private rents rent controls are seen as having led to the spread of slum dwellings under socialist regimes in @entity60 and @entity61			1
they deter landlords from renting out their properties or from decorating houses that are rented out , leaving tenants with dilapidated accommodation			0
a minister in the @entity60 in the 1980s said rent controls there led to poor housing standards and did more damage to @entity73 than @entity75 bombs			0
in @entity61 , rent controls imposed in december 2012 have failed to combat rising inflation which hit 39.6 per cent in june			0
in @entity79 , rent controls are blamed for reducing the city ’s housing supply			0
varying degrees of control over rent operated on and off in @entity84 from the @entity85 until the 1980s			0
official figures show they contributed to the private rented sector shrinking from 55 per cent of households in 1939 to 8 per cent in the late 1980s			0
@entity3 and his wife @entity21 own at least two large homes , including one in @entity91 , @entity46			0
but @entity4 has come under pressure from @entity18 , which has given the party £ 9.2million since @entity94 became leader , to adopt the plans			1
on july 15 the union ’s @entity98 feed declared : ‘ it ’s time for @entity4 to be bold and commit to introduce rent control for private landlords who are profiteering			2
’ on july 23 mr @entity3 spoke out at an ‘ affordable housing day ’ organised by @entity104			0
he said @entity4 is ‘ going through a whole range of options in terms of how you deliver more affordable and predictable rents ’ and that the party is looking at ‘ traditional rent controls that we once had in this country ’			2
mr @entity3 said an alternative would be to copy the ‘ models in @entity115 where you have longer - term tenancies and indexational rents ’			2
@entity120 mp @entity119 said : ‘ @entity4 ’s reckless gamble with rent controls would take us back to the 1970s : higher rents , fewer houses , and refurbishment would fall off a cliff			2
clearly , @entity18 are buying @entity4 ’s policy on rent controls			1
’ a spokesman for mr @entity3 said : ‘ we have made it clear we are not talking about traditional rent controls , but a new model that works for both landlords and tenants			0

@entity3 was heard saying @entity4 would *cap* private rents
promise came a week after same demand was made by @entity18
