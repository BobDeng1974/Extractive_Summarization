by sir @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 04:19 est , 8 january 2013 @entity1 once claimed to be so soft - hearted that he cried if a butterfly hit his windscreen			1
he is devoted to his pet cat @entity5 , whom he describes as his ‘ heart , soul and world ’			1
yet one chilling day last year i sat with him in his cell on @entity13 in the @entity14 and listened to him describe how he had slit the throat of a young mother and partially decapitated her four - year - old daughter			1
it had been a random attack while @entity1 was high on crystal meth and marijuana			1
his victims were strangers to him , a woman and a child simply unlucky enough to answer the door when he knocked at their home			1
his wickedness makes him an outcast even among other @entity13 inmates at this notorious maximum security penitentiary			1
as @entity1 himself told me : ‘ i think i probably deserve to die			1
’ moving tales : @entity0 in @entity14 where he came face to face with some of @entity35 's most dangerous prisoners and every - day life on @entity13 by the time he had finished speaking even the hardened legal professionals alongside me were ashen			1
although his guilt was not in doubt , @entity1 had never divulged such detail before , and while he was securely handcuffed , i could not wait to get out of his cell			1
i was , i admit , terrified			1
i thought : ‘ what the hell am i doing in here ? why am i sitting on the bed of a man on @entity13 with absolutely nothing to lose ? ’ the answer was to make a ground - breaking documentary about a subject that divides the civilised world : capital punishment			1
what does it mean to exist in the shadow of a death sentence , or a jail term of a century of more ? there are 1,900 inmates in @entity14			1
twelve are on @entity13 and many others have sentences far in excess of their natural life span			1
i was invited to spend two weeks among them , given unprecedented access to multiple murderers , cop killers , gang members , drug - runners , hitmen and sexual deviants			1
i needed a lot of convincing to say yes , and if my mother had been alive , she ’d have told me i was crazy			1
it was a fortnight filled with surprises			1
the first was that i thought i would find , as in the iconic prison film @entity80 , that ‘ everyone is innocent ’			1
that was not the case			1
softer side of a kill : death row inmate @entity86 lives for his pet cat @entity88 , yet this is the same man who slit the throat of an innocent young mother and nearly decapitated her child here were dozens of men talking freely about their crimes			1
there was a lot of blunt self - assessment and some profoundly sad reflections such as from one @entity13 inmate whose criminal career began with stealing the cookie jar in kindergarten			1
he was always last in the queue for a cookie and was often missed out , so one day he simply stole the jar			2
when he grew up he shot and killed a policeman			2
they were articulate , knowing men , perhaps none more so than double murderer @entity112			1
he killed two pensioners when he was aged just 13			1
he escaped @entity13 but got a 170 - year sentence			1
he will only be eligible for parole in 100 years			1
he ’s never been to a school prom , never driven a car or travelled abroad			2
in his cell i found him reading books about eugenics and metaphysics , a way of escape for a man who has none			2
he ’s a bit of a poster boy for @entity128 – yet i still had to interview him in a steel cage			2
that ’s the reality of life lived in lockdown 23 hours a day			2
about the one place where there is an air of normality is the prison barber ’s shop			2
it ’s for inmates and staff alike but is run by prisoners who handle scissors and razors			2
it was cosy and filled with easy banter and bonhomie			2
the barbers were in perfectly ironed tops , their leather wallets in breast pockets			2
@entity14 : the perimeters of the prison are enforced , covered in barbed wire and kitted out with cameras and the constantly watching eyes of the guards one was apologising that his moustache was not properly waxed that day			1
he looked like your favourite uncle , or someone who might turn up with your gifts at @entity164 , yet he had been a hitman			2
despite this , and despite the feuds and fights which are a potent undercurrent to prison life , there has never been an incident in the shop			2
and it was while in there that i came closest to understanding prison life			2
the prisoners had a powerful work ethic and were busy and fulfilled doing something for others			2
they were , i suppose , the maximum security equivalent of model citizens and were leading , insofar as they could , complete lives			2
yet at the end of the day they returned to cells within shouting distance of @entity13			1
the inmate who runs the barber ’s shop had a wall of photographs			2
he ’d mounted them on cardboard so he could take them with him if he ever gets out			0
he wo n’t , of course , which raises another question about @entity35 ’s judicial system : what is the difference between being given 150 years or being on @entity13 ? the answer , i suppose , is hope and arriving at some kind of modus vivendi			1
one inmate was married to a woman in @entity209 , while @entity1 had a girlfriend in @entity211 and spent his time imagining her pottering around her kitchen cooking dinner			0
growing up behind bars : sir @entity0 with @entity112 who is serving a 170 - year sentence for committing a double - murder at the age of 13 one @entity13 prisoner was obsessed with the late princess @entity219 and had papered his cell with pictures of her , including the famous @entity223 portrait of her in a strapless white dress and tiara			1
he said he believed in her goodness and likened her to @entity230 or @entity231			0
another , who had killed his wife and two children , had never learned to read or write , so he polished his cell and its contents until they shone			0
a lot had turned to religion for solace			0
several , including @entity1 , had joined a pet adoption programme and been given cats to look after			0
the idea is to make inmates more passive because ownership encourages a sense of responsibility			0
and there ’s real affection there			0
one cat called @entity252 had made friends among other prisoners besides his owner : no one from that gang of murderers would kill a cat			0
they would kill each other perhaps , but not a cat			0
the men ’s common fate has given rise to some unusual friendships , most of the ‘ he ’s got my back and i ’ve got his , ’ nature			0
inmates have their own codes of conduct and specific hatreds			0
the cop killer described some of the other inmates as ‘ sharks circling ’ , yet his bravado gave way to vulnerability when he spoke to me about his past			0
i am no amateur psychologist , but it struck me that their early lives were not ideal			0
i did n’t particularly like any of them but it was impossible to cut yourself off entirely from a sense of sadness at the circumstances which brought them to prison			0
i was horrified by what they had done , but you ’d be lacking any humanity and empathy if you did not feel for someone preparing to be put to death by the state			0
final rest : the trolley to which @entity13 prisoners are strapped prior to the lethal injection the time we saw the gurney – the trolley on which a condemned man is strapped prior to execution – was , i think , the defining moment for me			1
imagination is even more powerful than reality and the real fear lay in the superintendent ( the prison governor ) saying : ‘ these are the steps the condemned man would take , this is the isolation room where he would wait to be taken to the gurney			0
’ i was left imagining someone ’s last hours in that room with just a pair of slippers , a tv screen , a clock on the wall , and their every movement watched			0
i wrestled with that : how does one come to terms with the final hour of life in a room adjoining an execution chamber ? the gurney itself is just nuts and bolts , straps and handcuffs , but what goes through the mind ? i saw an image of that room when i went back to my hotel and i can see it now			0
i can still visualise the yellow slippers waiting for the feet of a condemned man			0
the superintendent is a fascinating character			0
he visits the men on @entity13 every week and – this was another shock – gets to know the men over whose executions he will eventually preside			1
he says : ‘ our course in life throws us together			0
at one particular juncture we will participate in the same event			0
’ he means the death of one of them			0
i am not a religious person but the superintendent told me he had made peace with @entity370 about his job and i took him at his word			0
end of the road : death row at @entity14 currently hosts 12 of the prison 's 1,900 inmates i have never accepted the philosophy of state killing and my mind has not been changed by this experience			1
but i do understand why that system is in place for people like @entity1 , and why @entity35 voters continue to support it			0
when i emerged from @entity1 ’s cell after hearing him speak in such detail , there was absolute silence			0
usually there is professional banter common to all tv jobs : bad jokes and teasing and chat , but after that there was just a hush			0
i was deeply affected by the depth of evil described in the interview and , like everybody on the crew , i found myself in need of a stiff drink			0
@entity1 , who committed his double murder in 2004 and was sentenced a year later , is likely to be the next man at @entity14 sent for execution			1
there is a natural momentum to human life , to our work and relationships but the men i met on @entity13 exist in a state of stasis			1
they are prisoners of the past , trapped in the present , with no true future			0
it was that which scared and saddened me the most			0
not the locks and keys or cages , or even the gurney			0
it was the fact that all they have left in their lives is time , and for some of them even that is running out			0
@entity430 with @entity0 starts on @entity431 at 9pm on thursday january 17 .			0
