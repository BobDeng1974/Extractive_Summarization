by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 02:48 est , 13 february 2013 @entity2 hospitals are demanding an end to national pay bargaining agreements so they can pay staff to reflect the local cost of living			1
the @entity7 – which represents more than 200 trusts across @entity9 – said introducing new ways of negotiating pay would allow money to be diverted to patient care			1
the organisation ’s chief executive , @entity14 , said it was time to consider setting pay regionally or trust - by - trust , as national agreements would not deliver the necessary cutbacks			1
change : the @entity7 - which represents more than 200 trusts across @entity9 - said introducing new ways of negotiating pay would allow money to be diverted to patient care a new deal on pay , terms and conditions for most @entity2 staff in @entity9 is due to be announced soon			1
one of its main changes is a clearer link between pay rises and performance			0
mr @entity14 said @entity2 trusts completely supported the deal on the table			1
however , he argued that the challenges of the next five years – a flat budget , rising costs , and the need to improve care at nights and weekends – mean more savings will be required			1
he explained that pay takes up between 60 and 70 per cent of an average trust ’s costs , but safety concerns mean it is impossible to cut staff numbers in the same way as other public services			2
mr @entity14 said he estimated the current deal would secure an average hospital annual savings of about £ 250,000 , out of the £ 11million needed , which some people might call ‘ a drop in the ocean ’			1
he added : ‘ trusts now have a pressing need for the @entity2 to start discussing the different ways we could set pay , terms and conditions including looking at whether we should set pay nationally , regionally or trust by trust – exactly the same debate as the education service is now having			1
‘ can the @entity2 , for example , continue to afford a system that gives 60 per cent of staff a 2 per cent pay increase every year , irrespective of performance , on top of any cost - of living - increase ? ’ unfair : chancellor @entity73 believes it is unfair that people earn just as money in areas where the cost of living is low than those in more expensive parts of the country so far there are moves towards allowing schools to set their own wage rates , but no progress has been made in health			1
the unions – supported by both @entity89 and the @entity90 – are vociferously opposed to proposed changes to the national pay bargaining system			0
at the moment , public sector pay review bodies negotiate with the unions to agree on a flat - rate pay deal for the entire country			2
the @entity96 would like to allow the pay review bodies to put forward regional pay deals to reflect the cost of living in different parts of the country			0
chancellor @entity73 believes it is unfair that people earn just as money in areas where the cost of living is low than those in more expensive parts of the country			0
and he says many private businesses can not compete with high public sector wages – meaning they stop creating jobs in depressed areas of the country			0
@entity113 , from the @entity112 , said : ' our experience shows that the cost of moving to individual negotiation can outweigh any potential benefit ' the chancellor would like to see public sector workers in the @entity121 earning more than those in the @entity123 , where housing is cheaper			0
a consortium of trusts are already trying to establish their own system of wage negotiations			0
they want to be able to set their own pay levels to reflect the higher cost of living in the @entity121			2
health minister dr @entity133 said he thought the proposed changes to @entity2 employee contracts were long overdue			2
he said : ‘ patient care lies at the heart of this			0
this is why discussions have been about making a much stronger link between providing high - quality patient care and annual pay progression with a much stronger emphasis on behaviours referenced in the @entity145 around compassion , dignity and respect			2
’ @entity113 , from the @entity112 , said abandoning the national pay negotiations would not resolve the severe financial pressures the @entity2 now faces			1
she said : ‘ our experience shows that the cost of moving to individual negotiation can outweigh any potential benefit			0
‘ nor will the @entity2 be able to raise the standard of care by moving to a system of pay cartels			1
‘ the present @entity160 system is a transparent and fair system that allows employers to plan ahead with certainty and to reward experience			0
’ @entity165 , from the public service union @entity166 , warned the proposed system could even undermine the new pay deal			0
she said : ‘ if the @entity7 is saying the current proposals are not enough it puts the whole thing at risk			0

@entity7 said new ways of negotiating pay are needed
chief executive said pay could be set regionally or on a trust - by - trust basis
@entity180 on pay , terms and conditions for @entity2 in @entity9 expected soon
but @entity14 said over next five years more savings will be required
