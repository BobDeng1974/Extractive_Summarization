for years , ramblers had treasured the wildflower meadows as the perfect spot for a walk			0
the 29 - acre site was also popular with joggers , dog walkers and schools ’ nature studies lessons			1
but now the idyll has been shattered after the new landowner put up a 6ft - high 300ft - long spiked steel fence enclosing the footpath to keep walkers – and dogs – off his land			1
the owner of a meadow in @entity18 , @entity19 , erected this 300ft - long fence around a pathway after wildlife campaigners asked him to keep the unofficial walkway clear before the fence was erected , campaigners attempted to block mr @entity27 's purchase of the land amid fears development of the area would damage the landscape campaigners had tried to block haulage boss @entity27 ’s attempt to buy @entity35 in @entity18 , @entity19 , amid fears that development would damage the landscape			1
but after successfully buying the land for £ 210,000 , mr @entity27 has put up the fence which locals say makes walkers feel like they are in a top security prison			1
ecologist @entity43 said : ‘ anyone thinking they will enjoy a nice country walk along the public footpath is now hemmed in by a horrific steel palisade fence			1
’ @entity49 , a member of the action group , said : ' we went to mr @entity27 to ask him if maybe there was something we could do to still access the field but he refused			1
' the path is used as a nice green walking route , that ’s all we wanted			0
' he said he wanted to use it for hay growing and obviously dogs mess is not good for that at all			0
' we did suggest that we could campaign for awareness to stop people doing that but he just was n’t having it			0
but mr @entity27 bought the land after @entity67 rejected a bid to protect the area by action group @entity70			1
the group attempted to register the land as a community asset , which also failed ' he put a fence in at the cut through to town before @entity76 , that was the first stand he took			1
' the community projects manager at @entity78 added : ' now he ’s put a fence around the only footpath we are allowed to use			2
' it is the sort of fence you put around some kind of industrial site that you are worried about vandals attacking			2
' it is completely over the top , it is really shocking			2
' when the fields were put up for sale last september following the death of the owner , some residents began a campaign to raise funds to buy and preserve the land			0
they tried to block the sale by registering the site as a community asset			0
after the group approached mr @entity27 asking for him to keep the walkway clear , he erected the fence - insisting walkers stick to the designated path when they approached mr @entity27 , who is also a farmer , to keep a well - used unofficial short cut across the field towards the town centre , he refused			1
mrs @entity49 said he fenced off the short cut before turning his attention to the official footpath			0
yesterday mr @entity27 , 64 , said he had built the fence to protect his livestock from the risk of disease posed by dog mess – and to protect dogs and walkers from his cattle			1
councillor @entity123 today said the new fencing would not look out of place ' in a high security prison ' he said : ' what other option did i have ? if i 'd have used a barbed wire fence people would have complained that their dogs and children were getting caught and the cattle would n't have liked it much either			1
' yes it probably does n't look that nice at the moment but it will dim down over time			0
i had to put it there for agricultural purposes , that was all i was doing			0
' the dogs mess was ridiculous and it had to be controlled otherwise it would have harmed my cattle			0
' the dog mess creates germs which get into cattle and abort the calves , i do n't want that happening			2
' i need to get the land clean for six months at least before the disease goes out the land and before i can graze cattle so it needs to happen sooner rather than later			0
' i went to the footpath people and asked if i could put a fence up and they said it was my right so , so i did			2
' i did it so it is safe for both parties , people can walk through safely , dogs can walk through next to the cattle safely , i 've seen lots of instances where cattle have chased dogs			0
' it 's avoiding injury , it 's health and safety			0
' he built the 6ft fence because barbed wire would have been a danger			1
‘ it probably does n’t look that nice at the moment but it will dim down over time , ’ he added			0
one neighbour , @entity172 , 72 , welcomed the fence			1
the community projects manager at @entity78 said of the fence : ' it is completely over the top , it is really shocking ' ‘ we were getting three dog - walking agencies parking on our road so they could use the field , ’ he said			1
‘ from about 6am there were about 15 to 20 cars a day with barking dogs , slamming doors and shouting to each other			0
‘ and the dog mess was unbelievable			2
sometimes it would be so bad we could n’t even sit in the garden because of the smell			0
’ but one local said mr @entity27 was a saint for putting up the fence - as noisy dog walkers were making his life hell by letting their animals mess around his home ' mr @entity27 is in my opinion a saint , and i speak for everyone who lives on the road			1
' since the fence has gone up we have n't had any cars parking on the street , the volume of people have gone from our road , the dogs mess has gone , the noise at 6am has gone			2
everyone you speak to now is like , " it 's quiet is n't it ? " ' all the people complaining about the beautiful meadow being ruined are wrong , in my opinion it was not beautiful at all , it was a nasty , smelly dogs park			2
' mr @entity172 added that mr @entity27 had left wire up for a small section of the foothpath but within days the wire was broken so people could get into the field once more .			1

@entity27 bought *picturesque* meadow in @entity18 , @entity19 for £ 210,000
wildlife campaigners approached man asking him to keep a pathway clear
but he refused - and erected a 300ft - long , 6ft - high fence around the walkway
fence described as ' horrific ' and ' over the top ' by local councillors today
one neighbour said mr @entity27 was a ' saint ' as dog walkers ' made his life hell '
