based on the findings , the researchers have compiled a playlist with song suggestions for cool down , aerobic warm up , varying levels of cardio intensity , strength training and cool down .			1

sport psychologists analysed the most popular workout songs on @entity29
they compared the beats per minute across various tracks and genres
rap and *hip* - *hop* music provides the best beats for stretching and running
