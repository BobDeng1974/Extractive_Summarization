by @entity0 one of @entity2 's former fellow interns has defended her right to speak out again about her affair with president @entity5			1
' i do feel bad for her because she was young			0
i do n’t blame her for coming forward now and saying , " i was tormented			2
i was bullied , " ' @entity8 said			1
ms @entity8 was one year older than @entity2 , who she called ' the portly pepperpot ' in an interview with the @entity11 , and spoke with her frequently when they were both part of the intern program			1
' some of my former colleagues are like , " do we really have to go through this again ? " but at this point it ’s like 20 years later , have n’t we all been curious about what she ’s been up to ? ' ms @entity8 said			2
this is n't the first time that ms @entity8 has spoke about the affair , as she was one of the first people to speculate about it when it was actually happening			2
' i told everyone i knew about the rumors			0
i told my college roommates			0
i told people in bars ... that ’s probably how i wound up in front of the grand jury , ' she told @entity52			1
back in the spotlight : @entity2 penned a tell - all article about her life after the scandal for this month 's @entity27 at the time , she ' was pissed ' that she got flown to @entity57 for the hearing because she felt shew as being asked to ' spread my gossip to the grand jury '			1
since then , ms @entity8 has moved to @entity63 and works as a restaurant and hospitality public relations specialist			2
the anger about the scandal and ensuing investigation has died down but curiosity about her former friend remains			0
one of the regrets she holds on to , however , is that the prestige of a @entity18 internship has been forever dampened			0
office gossip : unlike @entity77 who met @entity2 after she was transferred to the @entity78 , ms @entity8 worked with her in the @entity18 moving on : ms @entity8 now lives in @entity63 and works as a public relations specialist for restaurants and hospitality ms @entity8 's musings come after @entity2 wrote the tell - all article as a way to re-enter public life after staying ' virtually reclusive ' during @entity87 's first presidential run in 2008			1
' i put off announcing several media projects in 2012 until after the election			0
( they were subsequently canceled — and , no , i was n’t offered $ 12million for a salacious tell - all book , contrary to press reports , ) ' @entity2 wrote in the @entity27 article			1
' and recently i ’ve found myself gun - shy yet again , fearful of ‘ becoming an issue ’ should she decide to ramp up her campaign			0
but should i put my life on hold for another 8 to 10 years ? ' it ’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress			0

@entity8 worked with @entity2 at the @entity18 and heard *rumblings* about the affair before it was officially discovered
she had to *testify* in front of the grand jury about ' spread ( ing ) my gossip '
thinks it 's fine that ' the portly pepperpot ' has come back into the spotlight after writing a tell - all article about her life after the scandal
says it is *understandable* for @entity2 to ' come forward now and say " i was tormented , i was bullied "
