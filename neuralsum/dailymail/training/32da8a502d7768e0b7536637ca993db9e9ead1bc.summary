by @entity0 last updated at 2:06 pm on 6th september 2011 the savage riots last month could have led to the death of police officers , the @entity1 has warned , after shocking new footage emerged of a mob attacking patrol cars with bricks and metal railings			1
the video shows hooded youths smashing in the windows of a police car with café tables and chairs and hacking off a wing mirror			2
the frenzied attackers , wearing dark clothing and scarves over their faces , were filmed in @entity21 at around 8pm on monday , august 8 , wrecking the car with makeshift weapons including metal bars and street signs torn from the pavement			2
frenzied violence : a gang of hooded youths smash up a police car as a bystander watches in horror a brave bystander tries in vain to remonstrate with the group , before a policeman with a riot shield can be seen fleeing the violence			2
further horrifying cctv footage , shot in the same area less than a minute later , shows one of the same boys hurling a concrete slab through the windscreen of an unmarked @entity1 police car			1
wearing a distinctive adidas hoodie , he screams wildly before reaching through the window to punch the driver , who was left with cuts to his face			2
wanted man : the man who attacked the cars was wearing a dark hoodie with a blue or green adidas logo appeal : rioters in @entity21 , south - east @entity56 , attacked police and set stores alight in august			2
the @entity1 are now appealing for help in identifying the thugs last month ’s riots were the result of a ‘ broken penal system ’ that has failed to rehabilitate the hardcore ‘ criminal classes ’ , according to justice secretary @entity65			1
he revealed that almost 75 per cent of those aged over 18 charged with offences committed during the riots had prior convictions			1
mr @entity65 , pictured , said reform was vital to prevent reoffending among ‘ a feral underclass , cut off from the mainstream in everything but its materialism ’			1
he also expressed concern at ‘ the instinctive criminal behaviour of apparently random passers - by ’			0
his remarks will be seen as bitterly ironic by right - wing @entity80 , who blame him for threatening their party ’s reputation on law and order with a series of ‘ soft sentencing ’ policy proposals , which had to be overruled by @entity88			0
writing in the @entity90 , mr @entity65 said : ' it ’s not yet been widely recognised , but the hardcore of the rioters were in fact known criminals			1
close to three quarters of those aged 18 or over charged with riot offences already had a prior conviction			1
' he said he supported the judges , court staff and police , saying that rioters met a firm and speedy response , and praised those who worked 35 - hour shifts to bring the guilty to account			0
borough commander @entity108 said : ‘ the man in the footage could have seriously hurt or even killed one of the officers in the vehicle			1
' he condemned the ' extreme violence ' as police released the footage of the episodes in @entity117 and appealed for information			0
commander @entity108 said : ‘ members of the public have provided police in @entity122 with several investigative leads in the past couple of weeks and we are very grateful for all the help and support we have received			0
‘ however , we need more help and information to identify this violent individual			1
‘ if you know who he is , please call us in confidence			0
’ police said officers could have died or been seriously injured during the attack in south - east @entity56			0
their primary suspect is a black man wearing a dark top with a hood and blue or green adidas logo			0
witnesses are asked to contact police in @entity122 on 020 8284 9449 or @entity143 on 0800 555 111			0
meanwhile , as the effects of last month ’s riots took a heavy toll on retailers , the @entity144 has recorded its worst results in two years			1
shops reported a drop in profits of 2.2 per cent , according to accountancy firm @entity154 's @entity153			0
the widespread looting and destruction saw stores including @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 come under attack across @entity56 before violence spread to other cities .			0
