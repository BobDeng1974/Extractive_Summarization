they have been banished under low - carb diets and maligned nearly as much as bread			0
but potatoes are n't necessarily bad for the waistline - and could actually help us lose weight , a study claims			0
dieters who included potatoes in their meal plans all lost weight - as long as they reduced their overall calorie intake , researchers found			2
dieters who included potatoes in their meals all lost weight if they reduced calories , a study found the scientists concluded there is no evidence that potatoes lead to weight gain if they are prepared in a healthy manner			1
the researchers wanted to understand the role of lowering calories and the glycemic index ( @entity30 ) affected weight loss , when potatoes are included in the diet			1
the glycemic index is a scale of zero to 100 representing how quickly glucose is released into the bloodstream after eating carbohydrates			0
eating high @entity30 foods such as white bread and white rice causes a spike in blood sugar levels as glucose is released quickly into the bloodstream , followed by a slump when insulin is released to control it			1
low gi foods , such as wholegrain bread , porridge and brown rice , break down slowly during digestion , making dieters feel fuller for longer and stabilising blood sugar levels			0
as part of the study , 90 overweight men and women were split into three groups			0
the first group was told to reduce their calories but eat high @entity30 foods			1
a medium - sized potato contains 110 calories one medium - size potato with its skin on contains : just 110 calories per serving more potassium ( 620g ) than a banana almost half the daily value of vitamin c ( 45 per cent ) contains no fat , sodium or cholesterol the second group was told to reduce their calories but eat low @entity30 foods			1
people in the third group could eat whatever they wanted , with no restrictions on calories or @entity30 foods			1
all three groups were given potatoes , healthy recipes and told to eat five to seven servings of potatoes each week			2
at the end of the 12 - week study period , the researchers found all three groups had lost weight and there was no significant difference in weight loss between the groups			1
interestingly , even the control group reduced their calories and lost weight - despite not being provided with a specific calorie restriction			1
perhaps unsurprisingly , the research was funded by the @entity101 , which represents more than 2,500 @entity103 potato growers and handlers			0
however it was published in the @entity106 ' there is no evidence that potatoes , when prepared in a healthful manner , contribute to weight gain			2
in fact , we are seeing that they can be part of a weight loss program ' the researchers said lead researcher @entity118 , of the @entity119 said : ' some people have questioned the role of potatoes in a weight loss regimen because of the vegetable 's designation as a high glycemic index food			2
' however , the results of this study confirm what health professionals and nutrition experts have said for years : it is not about eliminating a certain food or food groups , rather , it is reducing calories that count			0
' he added : ' there is no evidence that potatoes , when prepared in a healthful manner , contribute to weight gain			0
in fact , we are seeing that they can be part of a weight loss program			0
' his co-researcher dr @entity146 , of the @entity148 , added : ' the fact that all groups , even the control group , lost weight is a curious finding and provides cause for future research			2

study looked at dieters eating low calories and high gi or low @entity30 foods
they also included a control group who had no calorie or @entity30 restrictions
all the groups were told to eat 5 to 7 servings of potato a week
after 12 weeks all the people lost *similar* *amounts* of weight
rather than cause weight gain , potatoes could *hep* weight loss , say experts
medium - sized spud has just 110 calories and half daily vitamin c dose
