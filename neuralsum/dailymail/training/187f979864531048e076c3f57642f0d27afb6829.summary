by @entity0 published : 19:51 est , 18 april 2012 updated : 23:18 est , 18 april 2012 @entity1 could be next to face a legal claim for damages from the @entity5 man who alleges @entity6 sent him to be tortured by @entity8 ’s regime , after he announced he was suing @entity9			1
in a move without precedent against an ex-minister , @entity10 served legal papers against the former foreign secretary over claims that he authorised the @entity6 to hand him over to @entity8 ’s government			2
the @entity18 has learned that mr @entity10 ’s lawyers are now preparing a case against mr @entity1 as well			1
lawsuit : @entity1 is facing a legal claim from @entity10 in another dramatic development , coalition ministers have apparently undermined mr @entity9 ’s claims of ignorance about the affair , revealing that papers showing he was implicated in the rendition of mr @entity10 do exist			1
@entity30 , a partner at @entity31 , the firm representing mr @entity10 , said : ‘ it would be surprising to us if something of this magnitude was not done with mr @entity1 ’s knowledge			1
‘ our clients would like us to follow this case up the chain of command			0
he was at the top of the chain of command			0
mr @entity10 certainly wants an apology from mr @entity1			1
’ mr @entity10 , 45 , was the leader of the @entity48 , which in 2004 was linked to @entity49 – links he fiercely denied			2
he was picked up that year following a tip - off by @entity6 and flown by the @entity52 , via the @entity54 territory of @entity55 , to @entity5 where he claims he was tortured for six years			0
the incident took place just days before mr @entity1 signed his notorious ‘ @entity58 ’ with @entity8			2
sued : mr @entity10 has already launched legal action against former foreign secretary @entity9 documents found in @entity61 following the fall of the dictator show that @entity6 counter-terrorism chief sir @entity64 boasted to @entity8 ’s spy chief @entity65 that ‘ the intelligence was @entity54 ’ which led to mr @entity10 ’s capture			1
he added that the tip - off was ‘ the least we could do for you and for @entity5 ’			0
last year mr @entity9 appeared to deny any knowledge of the operation			2
but it emerged at the weekend that after he made those claims , he was approached by @entity6 officers who showed him a document he had signed authorising the @entity78 figures in the @entity79 claim some documents implicating mr @entity9 do exist			2
one source said : ‘ there are papers that point the finger at @entity9			0
’ but @entity86 officials yesterday said they have ‘ no plans ’ to hand over the documents			0
lawyers for mr @entity10 and @entity89 , who also claims he was returned to @entity5 and tortured , yesterday served mr @entity9 with notice that they will launch formal legal proceedings against him unless he comes clean , apologises and produces key documents			1
soldier : @entity10 speaks to @entity5 at a rally in @entity61 in september 2011 mr @entity10 , now a senior official in the @entity5 transitional government , is already suing the @entity97 and sir @entity64			1
they all have four weeks to come clean and publish the papers or the civil case will begin			0
miss @entity30 said : ‘ if the former foreign secretary does not now own up to his role in this extraordinary affair , he will need to face the prospect of trying to defend his position in court			0
’ she added : ‘ the real issue here is not about the amount of compensation , it is to get public acknowledgement and an admission from @entity9 and others involved in his rendition			0
we have evidence that implicates very senior people			0
’ but she admitted they could seek damages that would force mr @entity9 to sell his house			0
mr @entity9 and mr @entity1 are also expected to be questioned by @entity123 detectives , who have launched a criminal inquiry into the behaviour of ministers and intelligence officials			1
mr @entity1 has previously claimed he has no recollection of the case			1
yesterday mr @entity9 refused to comment , saying : ‘ i am sorry that i ca n’t say more about this case , but with a police investigation pending and this intended civil legal action i am sorry that it is not appropriate for me to say any more about it			1
‘ they are entitled to bring the action and it will be dealt with in due course			0
