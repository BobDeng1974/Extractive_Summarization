sauntering down leafy avenues past typical @entity7 step - ­ gabled buildings , carpets of crocuses , the occasional cyclist whooshing quietly by and the sun bouncing off the canal , i can think of few more pleasant places to spend a spring weekend than @entity11			1
this is also prime territory for a gallery ­ lover like me : the beautiful , elegant and not - ­ too - ­ big @entity15 was restored last year			2
this is also the home of @entity17 , the ' @entity7 @entity18 '			1
but i am not only here for the @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
much more than a village : the @entity24 stands proud in @entity11 - a hidden gem of a city there is the @entity29 gallery ( devoted to that geometry - ­ defying genius ) , the contemporary art @entity32 and more			1
meanwhile , i am being charmed by an unsuspected delight : this medieval city by the sea			2
' city ? this is @entity38 's biggest village , ' says my guide , @entity40			1
he is right : the @entity11 , despite being home to @entity44 's royal family and an eye - ­ catching parliament , was classed as a village until @entity47 ( @entity48 's brother and king of @entity44 ) set up here in 1806			1
it has a genteel moat / canal , which encircles the historic centre			2
we step across and in front of an approaching car , which slows down deferentially			2
@entity40 tells me that many traffic lights have been taken out for aesthetic reasons			0
' now , the cars are very careful , ' he says			0
the @entity11 is home to one of the cornerstones of @entity38 art - @entity20 's @entity17 you have to love that kind of @entity7 logic - though it does n't seem to apply to cyclists , who rule the place			1
next time , i will rent a bicycle , although the trams and buses are easy and cheap ( an all - day pass costs € 7.70 / £ 5.60 )			0
over the moat , we are in noordeinde street			0
@entity40 ushers me into what used to be part of a palace , and still has huge chandeliers and ornate mirrors			0
this cobbled part of town is home to private galleries and unassuming cafes ( i snacked in the @entity87 ) , as well as altogether more assuming ones			0
@entity89 is the latest @entity91 star in town and the best place for @entity95 cuisine			0
the most prized @entity7 colony was apparently run from @entity11 ( aka ' the @entity97 ' )			1
for summer : the excellent @entity98 and the @entity99 on @entity100 will have boats on a newly renovated bit of canal , with music and boat trips planned , including a tour at the @entity108 brewery ( i can vouch for the product )			2
my art gorging finishes at the @entity112 , an extraordinary , 14 ft - ­ high circular panorama of the @entity11 's seaside resort , @entity115 , painted by @entity116			1
i take a 15 - minute tram to the place itself and gorge on scallops and sole at catch by @entity122 on the harbour front			0
the @entity11 has netted a new fan			1
@entity125 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to @entity126 ( half - hour taxi ) from £ 100 return			0
for tours with @entity40 , email remco.dorr @ ­ hotmail.com			0
double rooms at the @entity133 ( 00 31 70 363 0363 , www.carlton.nl/­ambassador ) cost from £ 84 , room only			0

the least known of the @entity7 cities , the @entity11 was a village until 1806
it owes its *growth* to @entity47 , @entity48 's brother , who ruled here
the city has a *wealth* of art , including @entity20 's ' @entity17 '
