@entity0 is hoping his million dollar gift will trigger a new group of ' supercenternarians ' a @entity5 multi-millionaire whose dream it is to live forever has promised to give $ 1 million to the first person to reach the age of 123			1
@entity0 , a senior partner of @entity11 - based firm , @entity10 , is hoping his million dollar gift will trigger a new group of ' supercenternarians '			1
he says research into stem cells , tissue rejuvenation and regenerative medicine will allow people to live beyond 120 - an age that has been quoted as the ' real absolute limit to human lifespan '			2
' we live in the most exciting era of human development when technologies become exponential and transformative , ' @entity0 told @entity26			1
' they may not realise it , but some of the supercentenarians alive today may see the dawn of the next century if they live long enough for these transformative technologies to develop			2
' i hope that my prize will help some of them desire longer lifespans and make their approaches to living longer a little more competitive			1
' @entity39 born @entity38 currently holds the record , having lived to age 122.5			1
already , a number of supercentenarians are candidates to best @entity45 's record			1
the oldest verifiable supercentenarians living now are @entity47 , at 115 years , and @entity48 , also at 115 years			1
both are @entity50 , and @entity47 is older by 44 days			2
in the last few years , major anti-aging companies , such as @entity52 's @entity56 's new @entity55 - based genome sequencing start - up @entity53 , have launched			2
along side this , @entity57 like @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62 are also funding research into longevity science			0
one of the oldest supercentenarians living today is @entity47 , at 115 years old			1
she is pictured here with a photograph showing her and her late husband @entity70 in her home in @entity72 , @entity73 @entity52 has invested in taxi firms , smart thermostats and even artificial intelligence but it is also setting its sights on immortality - or at least increasing our lives five-fold			0
in an interview with @entity84 , @entity82 ' president @entity81 said he thinks it 's possible to live to 500 years old			0
and this will be helped by medical breakthroughs as well as a rise in biomechanics			0
he has already ploughed money into genetics firms and cancer diagnostic startups and said : ' we have the tools in the life sciences to achieve anything that you have the audacity to envision			1
i just hope to live long enough not to die			2
' mr @entity81 has advised @entity100 in the development of a hydrophobic acrylic lens for cataract blindness , and helped develop @entity52 â€™s @entity105 project			0
@entity106 is a research and development company set up in 2013 by @entity52 and @entity107 to tackle ' ageing and associated diseases			0
' @entity52 co-founder @entity110 said the project would focus on ' health , wellbeing and longevity ' and last @entity105 partnered with @entity115 to open a research centre into neurodegeneration and cancer			0
although these firms are focused on extending life naturally , there is also a group that believes machines will be the key to extending lives beyond 120 - an age that has been quoted as the ' real absolute limit to human lifespan '			2
@entity62 is the founder of the @entity129 with the goal of helping humans achieve physical immortality within the next three decades			0
@entity133 reported that gerontologist dr @entity134 , chief scientist at @entity135 and anti-aging advisor to the @entity137 , thinks scientists may be able to control aging in the near future			2
' i 'd say we have a 50/50 chance of bringing aging under what i 'd call a decisive level of medical control within the next 25 years or so , ' he said			0
@entity0 is hopeful people will soon start living to 150 years of age with longevity science improving			1
studies in stopping and reversing aging in mice have already shown some success , and people around the world are generally living longer all the time			0
for example , life expectancy hit an all time high of nearly 79 years - old in 2014 in @entity50 according to a report from @entity162 's @entity161			0
additionally , @entity164 's oldest person , @entity163 , just died at the age of 114			1
she was believed to be the last person living in the @entity164 who was born in the reign of @entity170 @entity169			2
whether @entity0 's million dollar prize will encourage people to live longer is still to be seen			1
but this is n't the first time @entity0 has made news with in the longevity field using his resources			1
at january 's @entity178 in @entity179 , he recently bet dr @entity180 , phd , ceo of anti-aging company @entity181 for a million dollars in stock who would live beyond 100 years of age			1
' we live in the most exciting era of human development when technologies become exponential and transformative , ' @entity0 told @entity26			1
' they may not realise it , but some of the supercentenarians alive today may see the dawn of the next century ' ' longevity competitions may be a great way to combat both psychological and biological aging , ' dr. @entity180 said			1
' i hope that we will start a trend			0
' @entity200 thinks longevity science today resembles the computer industry in the 70s or networking in mid- 90s			0
' most of the pieces are there , ' he said			0
' we just need a product or a service to transform the way we live			0
the revolution in longevity is just around the corner and it is time to seriously engage in the field			0
' historically speaking , prizes have made a difference in the way science and culture has evolved , and also in the way people look at the world			2
the @entity223 , given out in @entity224 , @entity225 every year , are perhaps the most famous and coveted of all awards on the planet			0
at january 's @entity178 in @entity179 , @entity0 ( right ) made a bet with dr @entity180 ( left ) , phd , ceo of anti-aging company @entity181 for a million dollars in stock who would live beyond 100 years of age scientists and peace activists careers can change overnight by winning the prestigious prize			1
it 's possible the million dollar prize for the longest living person ever on the planet will also evolve into a well - known award			1
perhaps other wealthy enthusiasts will step forward to offer new longevity awards after a supercentenarian reaches age 123			0
maybe a trend will be set , and new awards for age 135 , or even age 150 will be established .			0

the large prize is being offered by *businessman* , @entity0
he hopes money will help create a new group of ' supercenternarians '
@entity38 holds the record of oldest person , dying aged 122.5
he has made a $ *1m* bet with dr @entity180 on who will die first
