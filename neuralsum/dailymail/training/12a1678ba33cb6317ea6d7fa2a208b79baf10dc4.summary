while @entity17 sadly discovered that her mother , @entity18 , had passed away , she did gain two sisters she did n't know she had - @entity20 and @entity21 - after the photo went viral			1

' i 'm just so happy that she 's alive and that she 's ok and she 's beautiful and is living a good full life			0
and perfectly normal , perfectly normal , practically perfect in every way			0
' the meeting came a week after @entity17 , herself a mother to a daughter , posted an image on @entity9 on march 7 asking for help tracking down her parents			1
@entity58 : @entity17 ( in green ) is pictured seeing her sister @entity20 for the first time on saturday sisters : @entity17 , right , wore a t - shirt to celebrate just learning that her grandfather had been @entity65 together : the women embrace after meeting - little over a week since @entity17 posted her picture ' i was born on november 18 , 1977 in @entity71 , @entity72 , ' it read			1

the women said they did n't know their sister 's real name or if she was even alive happy : the women live in different states but said they have the rest of their lives to make up for lost time @entity24 and @entity21 , who had grown up together , knew their mother had given birth to another girl , but they knew her as ' @entity115 ' and thought she had died or suffered serious problems because of their mother 's addiction			1
@entity24 said that she would never have known the truth had it not been for @entity17 's plea because they had the wrong name			0
