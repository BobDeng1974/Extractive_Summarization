reverend @entity0 has described homosexuality as a ' medical issue ' saying there was a hormone imbalance a @entity6 vicar refused to christen a baby boy because his lesbian parents both wanted to be registered as his mother			1
@entity10 , 25 , and her civil partner @entity11 , 22 , had hoped to welcome one - year - old @entity12 into the church with a traditional christening			2
but reverend @entity0 told them it was ‘ impossible ’ for him to have two mothers – forcing his archdeacon to intervene and give permission for the service to go ahead			2
the 87 - year - old from @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 – who says he ‘ feels sorry ’ for gay people because they are medically ‘ imbalanced ’ – refused to conduct the ceremony claiming it could be ‘ illegal ’ to proceed in the way they wanted			1
the couple stormed out of the meeting after the vicar suggested that one of them should be listed as godmother instead because the baptism certificate only has space for one mother and one father			1
@entity12 ’s birth mother @entity40 said : ‘ there was no way one of us was going to be listed as the godparent			1
we are both @entity12 ’s mum			2
‘ @entity47 sat there and told us no child could have parents of the same sex , no child could have two mothers			0
civil partners @entity40 and @entity53 ( pictured on their wedding day ) stormed out of the church meeting the couple wanted @entity22 to recognise them both as parents to one - year - old @entity12 ‘ he did this for about ten or 15 minutes and was asking us why we want @entity12 brought into the church			1
’ she added : ‘ i ’m baptised @entity6 and @entity11 is a @entity62			0
we want him to be brought up [ @entity63 ] the same that we have been			0
‘ we were even saying to the reverend : “ do you want @entity12 to be ashamed of his family ? ” he ’s not gay , we are , what we do is up to us			2
’ full - time mother @entity40 and law student @entity11 , who live in the nearby town of @entity70 , had initially organised the baptism with @entity72 – who has since moved away from the church			1
church : @entity47 is among other clergy standing in for @entity72 , who has recently left his post as vicar at the @entity24 church retired vicars , including @entity47 , are now officiating until a replacement can be found			1
the pair had chosen @entity22 ’s as @entity40 herself was baptised there and her parents married there			1
@entity47 , who has been a vicar for 40 years , claimed the couple ’s sexuality was not an issue and that he had been willing to baptise @entity12 if they agreed to record just one of them as mother			1
the vicar , who lives in a £ 350,000 bungalow in the nearby village of @entity96 , added : ‘ they insisted they both be registered as mum and refused to budge from their position			2
they will not give way and that ca n’t happen			0
their sexuality has no bearing on the issue			0
the church baptism register makes no provision for it			1
‘ we have bent over backwards to try and accommodate this family			0
i believe it would be illegal for me to register them both as mother			2
' impossible ' : @entity47 said there was not the space in the @entity6 register for two mothers ‘ the soul of the little boy is more important than anything else but we have a stalemate			2
’ @entity11 said the couple , who both wore white dresses on their wedding day in 2011 , were upset and shocked by their treatment			0
she added : ‘ it ’s so hard not to be put off by our experience			0
‘ you get told “ yes you can do it ” and then that all changes and they completely disregard it			0
‘ you do not expect a little , frail , old man to say this			0
’ however , in a last minute u-turn the @entity139 , the @entity140 , intervened in the row last night			0
he confirmed that the christening can go ahead without @entity47 – with both women named as mother on the certificate			0
he said : ‘ having spoken to @entity10 , i ’m pleased to report that the baptism of @entity12 will go ahead at @entity22			1
‘ we have addressed the legal issue			0
as i understand it , her partner @entity11 has full legal co-parental responsibility for @entity12			0
‘ we will therefore be able to enter their details on to the baptism register as mother and mother , as they would like			1
’ he added : ‘ i ’m pleased that this issue has been resolved , and we are looking forward to welcoming @entity40 , @entity11 and @entity12 , as well as their friends and family			1
’ @entity40 ’s mother , @entity165 , 44 , said : ‘ somebody from the church phoned to say sorry and to say the baptism can go ahead			1
it ’s great news but it should never have got to this stage in the first place			0
