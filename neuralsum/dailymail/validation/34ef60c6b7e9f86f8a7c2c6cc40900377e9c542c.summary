@entity1 's courts are ‘ seriously weakening ’ the fight against terrorism by ‘ trotting along ’ with politically correct rulings from @entity6 judges , a new study claims			1
@entity1 judges are on an ‘ expansionist binge ’ which has led them to implementing human rights laws made in @entity11 on crucial national security issues including deporting terror suspects and control orders			2
by applying and interpreting @entity17 legislation , the unelected judiciary is ‘ meddling ’ in policy decisions made by @entity23 which amounts to a ‘ denial of democracy ’ , according to a report by the influential @entity20 think - tank			1
it calls for a shake - up of the @entity28 to prevent further ‘ power grabs ’ by the @entity1 courts encroaching into areas that should be left to the government and @entity33			1
battle : muslim cleric @entity35 , described as @entity37 ’s spokesman in @entity1 , was finally returned home in 2013 after a 12 - year legal battle which cost taxpayers millions the report , published today @entity42 , blasts @entity1 ’s left - leaning judiciary for being ‘ too willing ’ to apply rulings from the @entity45 in the @entity1 , rather than simply taking them into account			1
barrister @entity48 , who wrote the study @entity50 , said the situation was hampering the government ’s ability to protect our borders by fighting terrorism and illegal immigration – putting innocent lives at risk			0
in one high - profile case , the @entity60 ruled in 2008 that deporting hate preacher @entity35 would breach his human rights , because evidence to be used against him on trial in @entity65 may have been obtained through torture			0
the firebrand @entity68 cleric , described as @entity37 ’s spokesman in @entity1 and who spouted bile on the streets on @entity72 , was finally returned home in 2013 after a 12 - year legal battle which cost taxpayers millions of pounds			0
meanwhile , @entity1 judges have been blasted for weakening now - defunct control orders and the replacement @entity79 and @entity80 ( @entity81 ) which were introduced to impose rigid restrictions on terror suspects who could not be prosecuted or deported			0
it fuelled concern that the judiciary was chiselling away at measures to protect the @entity1 from jihadists			0
' too willing ' : @entity1 judges have been accused of being too willing to apply rulings from @entity91 courts in the @entity1 , rather than taking them into account there has also been outrage over cases in which criminals have avoided deportation by pleading that their removal would breach the family life clause of the @entity100			1
among them was @entity102 , a failed asylum seeker who ran down and killed 12 - year - old @entity103 - and fled the scene - while disqualified from driving			0
a judge subsequently allowed him to remain here because he had two children with a @entity1 woman			0
in his report , mr @entity48 said : ‘ the domestic courts are on an expansionist binge , which has never been checked by the government or parliament			2
‘ continued failure to check this development will result not only in a serious weakening of national defences against terrorism and illegal immigration , but will also amount to a denial of democracy			2
‘ national security and the public interest actually refer to the human rights of thousands or even millions of individuals			0
‘ preventing the government from detaining or deporting potentially dangerous individuals may result in the violation of the individual rights to liberty or even to life of thousands of law - abiding citizens			2
’ the report says that @entity1 domestic courts tend to ‘ trot along ’ rulings made by the @entity45 because it is ‘ politically correct ’			1
‘ more and more @entity139 judges are now starting to pooh - pooh the age - old @entity1 constitutional principle of the sovereignty of parliament and the rule that legislation and policy decisions are no - go areas for the courts , ’ mr @entity48 wrote			1
but he also criticised successive ‘ supine ’ governments for ‘ lacking the courage ’ to stand up to the judiciary			1
demanding reform rather than the scrapping of the @entity28 , he said it was imperative that ‘ clear limits ’ are imposed on the ability of judges to interpret and extend the scope of @entity6 human rights laws			1
at last year ’s @entity161 party conference , justice secretary @entity159 has gone further by pledging to scrap @entity162 ’s @entity28 and replace it with a @entity1 @entity163 if the @entity161 win the election			2
under explosive plans to seize back sovereignty over human rights from @entity6 , this would ignore verdicts by @entity17 judges it does not agree with in a bid to reinstate the primacy of @entity23			0
he said if @entity11 objected , the @entity1 would resign from the @entity45 and ‘ walk away ’			0

think tank says meddling in parliamentary policy is denial of democracy
calls for shake - up in @entity28 to stop ' power grabs ' by courts
judiciary ' too willing ' to apply @entity17 rulings rather than just considering them
