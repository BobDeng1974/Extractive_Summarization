by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 free - to - air television viewers could soon be subject to an extra seven minutes of advertising every hour under proposals from some of the biggest television networks			1
networks can only show a maximum of 13 minutes of ' non-program matter ' between 6pm and midnight , according to the code of practice set out by @entity12			1
these rules are relaxed under certain conditions such as during elections , with promotions for the program itself also not falling under the category of ' non-program matter '			1
leading national free - to - air television networks @entity21 and @entity22 are arguing for advertisement regulations to be relaxed to allow a maximum of 20 minutes of adds within each hour of programming however @entity21 along with the @entity26 are now calling for the limit to be increased to 20 minutes of advertisements within every hour			1
' the proposal being discussed at @entity30 is to make advertising time limits for the main channel consistent with what is already the case on multi-channels			2
these do n't seem to have caused any major problems or viewer complaints for the past four years , a spokesperson for @entity21 told @entity1			0
' this is really just about allowing more flexibility in scheduling advertising and not running two sets of traffic systems across the various channels			0
we would not envisage any significant uplift in overall advertising minutes out of the changes			2
' free tv @entity3 recently appeared to agree on the lack of flexibility free networks faced in terms of advertising in a recent submission to the @entity57 inquiry			0
network ten is the only major network that has opposed the advertisement increase , however recent data released by @entity59 found that all three stations are already exploiting their advertisement limits ' while broadcasters recognise that there are community expectations that an appropriate balance between program matter and advertising is maintained , the existing requirements are overly complicated , ' the submission stated			2
the submission also clarified that advertising was essential for free - to - air television , to ensure the service remains a free and competitive service			0
@entity76 is the only major network that has opposed the advertisement increase , with a spokesperson telling @entity1 : ' such a move would disenfranchise the audience and damage the viewing experience '			1
however data released by @entity59 to @entity83 earlier this year , found that all three stations are already exploiting their advertisement regulations by running up to 29 minutes of ads during their prime time airing			2
the biggest culprits were revealed to be programs such as @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
@entity92 currently receives more than 40 per cent of all advertising revenue nationally , while the @entity26 receives just over 38 per cent			0
@entity76 's ratings have fallen below the two leading stations , with its advertising revenue making up the final 20 per cent			1
@entity1 have approached the @entity98 and ten networks for a comment .			0

the code of practice only allows for 13 minutes of ' non-program matter ' each hour
seven and nine are arguing for the maximum to be relaxed to 20 minutes
@entity76 has so far opposed the regulation change
