he said : ' i do get some odd looks sometimes on my travels			0
they know me round where i live , but abroad people do give me funny looks			0
' actually in countries like @entity42 and @entity32 it was n't necessarily because of the unicycle , they just shrugged me off as @entity44 so i must be doing something weird			1
' some of them actually thought it was what @entity48 do , ride unicycles all the time			0
if only that was the case			0
' i have travelled on the @entity8 , descended down @entity52 , a 5950 - metre volcano in @entity34 , and climbed the third highest mountain in @entity55			2

he designs and sells his own mountain unicycles he has helped popularise the fringe sport through his appearances in tv documentaries and features in numerous magazines ' when i first started unicycling i was probably one of the only people in the world to try and ride the same trials as two - wheeled bikes but now there are more and more people willing to give it a try			1
' i also design my own unicycles which are made for those who want to give trialing a go , it 's a lot cheaper than mountain biking to buy a unicycle so who knows maybe more and more people will do it			0
