sir @entity0 has leapt to the defence of @entity2 in the @entity4 storm , arguing that big personalities sometimes have to be excluded for the benefit of the team			1
former @entity9 coach flower has been heavily criticised for what has been seen in some quarters as a failure to manage a maverick personality like @entity4 in a dressing room environment			1
but @entity0 has admitted he omitted sir @entity15 from the @entity17 team this year because of the issues that exist between the @entity20 winner and 2013 champion , @entity21			1
the best sports people in the world are n't normal people			0
so you 're bound to get difficult scenarios and conflict			0
' i 've never met @entity4 , but i do know @entity2			1
' i ca n't draw a conclusion or comment because i do n't know the full story or the full detail of the facts			0
but we should n't forget that he 's had a fantastic run at managing the national team			1
' you 're always going to have a degree of conflict when you 're managing very , very driven individuals			0
' you 've got to decide if you want a team and if being a team is the optimal way of winning			2
and if you 've got somebody who is contrary to that process of having a team , you 've got to think very carefully about what you 're trying to do			2
@entity0 said since his appointment as coach in 2009 , @entity2 has had a fantastic run at managing the team @entity9 ’s highest ever run scorer @entity4 claims he 's not sure why he was sacked by the @entity68 in february @entity4 leaves the field after being dismissed during day two of the @entity70 in january ' we all face challenges over time , in all walks of life			1
when you 've got flair players , or big characters , the guys who do n't quite fit			2
it 's a challenge for all of us to try to marry those into a team			1
sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't			0
' ultimately what we think about a lot of the time is team			2
i 'm more inclined to think about what we want to win			0
' if you get the right guys , they 're motivated , passionate about it , we put the right group together , the team will look after itself			2
' you have to have the values and the team aspect of it , but ultimately you get people driven			0
' there 's an element , if we 're not careful , of the whole team ethic and values which does n't penetrate right down to individual performance on a day to day , granular level			1
' @entity0 stressed that @entity2 's achievements should not be forgotten amid the controversy			1
' i 'm very sympathetic to @entity2 , ' he said			1
' people forget that we had n't won the ashes for such a long time and he took us on a journey down to @entity112 and he took the @entity109 back			0
' i 'm not a cricket aficionado , but , to me , i think he changed the mentality			0
from a pretty poor run , all of a sudden we were winning the @entity109 and we were expected to win the @entity109			0
' he 's getting criticised for having not won the @entity109 and we should stop and think about that			2
we 're very much about the moment that we 're in			0
@entity2 did a fantastic job as far as i can see			2
' @entity0 received criticism for omitting sir @entity15 from @entity17 's @entity17 team this year @entity122 ' fractious relationship with @entity21 was the reason behind his exclusion from the @entity17 speaking at the leaders in @entity127 conference at @entity128 on wednesday , @entity0 admitted he omitted @entity122 because of his fractured relationship with @entity21			1
@entity0 faced some criticism for excluding @entity122 , particularly after @entity21 crashed out only a few days into the race			1
but @entity0 says he had to put the feelings of team leader @entity21 first , and felt the inclusion of @entity122 in the nine man team when they clearly loathe one another would be counter-productive			1
@entity138 's @entity137 reveals how @entity4 tried to woo @entity9 coach @entity2 @entity139 : @entity4 is wrong			1
there was absolutely no bullying in the @entity9 camp @entity4 : ' @entity143 ' @entity2 wanted to get me out of the @entity9 team @entity4 brands @entity2 as ' f * * * * * * horrendous ' and a ' @entity147 ' @entity4 reveals how @entity2 wanted a team of eager boy scouts ' you can have a nice popular team if you want but popularity does n't always win , ' said @entity0 in clear reference to the disappointment felt that @entity122 would not be riding the three @entity156 stages of this year 's @entity20			1
' forget @entity4 , ' he said			0
' i had a few of my own to deal with , and there are challenges			0
' we had a tricky season with two big champions , big personalities - very driven			1
' a number of times people said to me ' why do n't you get @entity21 and @entity168 in a room , bang their heads together and tell them to get on with it '			2
' that would have been the easiest thing to do			0
but over three weeks in @entity174 you are travelling together in the morning , racing , then travelling after and eating together			0
it would have been like a @entity177 scenario			0
' i had to ask myself if that was going to be optimal for the team in that environment			0
and the answer was no. @entity0 and @entity17 have had a disappointing year following their back - to - back wins at the tour ' our best chance of winning the @entity20 lay in @entity21 's hands and i had to build the team around @entity21			1
' you get challenging scenarios ; difficult decisions that can be fairly uncomfortable			0
but my analysis was , do we want to win ? ' after a difficult year for @entity17 – that followed back - to - back wins at the @entity20 – @entity0 said he was considering ripping up the blueprint that has delivered so much success and starting again			1
' i 'm not trying to work out what a sports team in 2020 is going to look like , ' he said			0
he also said @entity122 would be targeting the iconic hour record in june			0
' there is a plan for him to do it and i 'm sure he can do it , ' said @entity0			2
' when you look at the riders who could go for the hour record , and feasibly achieve a better distance than @entity206 's just achieved , then i think @entity15 's probably one of the most accomplished			1
