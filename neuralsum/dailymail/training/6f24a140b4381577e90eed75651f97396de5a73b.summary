by @entity0 @entity1 was unable to strengthen his claims for a 100 metres spot at the @entity4 as he could only manage 10.20 seconds for sixth place on his @entity7 debut in @entity8 on saturday night			1
the 20 - year - old tops the @entity11 rankings after running 9.96s in @entity12 last month , but is battling it out with the fit - again @entity14 for the third and final spot on the team for august 's @entity17 in @entity18			0
after missing out on automatic selection for the event by coming third at the @entity23 last weekend - @entity19 and @entity20 booked their places by finishing first and second - @entity1 had been hoping to respond to @entity27 's 10.03s run in @entity28 on thursday			1
disappointing : @entity1 only managed to finish sixth on his @entity7 debut but , after a long delay while the man a lane inside him , @entity33 's @entity30 , complained in vain over his disqualification for a false start , @entity1 , running in lane eight , never got into the race			1
@entity40 @entity39 took the victory in 10.00			1
@entity27 may now hold the edge in the fight for the third 100m spot in @entity18 , given his outing in @entity28 was his first race of the season following a hamstring injury and his young rival has struggled to back up his @entity12 performance			1
there was reason for @entity11 cheer at the @entity54 , though , as @entity55 and @entity56 both ran personal bests in the 1500m			0
@entity59 set a new @entity61 record and became the fifth fastest briton ever over the distance as she clocked 4.00.07 to finish sixth in a race won by @entity66 's @entity65 in a world - leading 3:57.00			2
@entity56 was eighth in 4:00.17 to go sixth on the @entity11 all - time list			1
tough : @entity1 might have given his rivals the edge when it comes to @entity4 qualifying @entity73 clocked a @entity33 record and world - leading 12.94 in winning the 110m hurdles			2
there were two more world leads from @entity80 athletes , with @entity81 winning the 800m in 1:43.34 and @entity83 the 5,000m in 12:59.82			0
@entity84 was fourth in the long jump with 6.70m and @entity86 fifth in the 100m hurdles in 12.72			0
@entity88 , the @entity90 number one , could only manage seventh in the 400m hurdles in 49.73 , while @entity93 was 13th in the 3,000m steeplechase			0
meanwhile , in @entity96 at the @entity97 , there was further evidence of @entity11 's exciting sprint talent			0
@entity100 , who wants to focus on the 200m at the @entity17 , set a new 100m personal best of 10.04 , timely less than three weeks out from the @entity102 , while 18 - year - old @entity103 clocked a marginally windy 11.03 in the women 's 100m			0
strike a pose : @entity1 with his @entity108 medal won in @entity109 last year			2

@entity1 manages just sixth place in 100m with time of 10.20 seconds
@entity27 could now have the *advantage* in their qualification battle
@entity40 @entity39 secured victory in @entity8 with 10.00s run
