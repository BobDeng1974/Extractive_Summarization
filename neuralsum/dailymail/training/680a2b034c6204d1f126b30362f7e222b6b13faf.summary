what they are : blood pools and thickens into a clot after an injury or because of a heart problem , clogged arteries or other condition			1

risk factors : high blood pressure , diabetes , birth control pills , pregnancy , stroke , recent surgery , prolonged sitting , circulation problems and heart problems — especially an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation — raise the chances of developing a blood clot			1
treatment : sometimes a blood thinner such as warfarin ( @entity117 ) is prescribed to allow the clot to dissolve by itself over time and prevent new ones from forming			1

' earlier this week , @entity179 reported that brain cancer was behind mrs @entity0 's health problems and that she was facing a barrage of medical tests to confirm the diagnosis			0
