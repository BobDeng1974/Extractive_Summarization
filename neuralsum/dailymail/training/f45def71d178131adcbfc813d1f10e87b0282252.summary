by @entity0 published : 12:03 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 13:47 est , 2 august 2012 @entity2 ambassador prince @entity1 cracked a string of @entity5 jokes at a reception yesterday – ribbing culture secretary @entity7 about his bell clanging disaster , the scandal of empty seats at @entity5 venues and even the drugs furore surrounding teenage @entity15 swimmer @entity14			1
echoing the antics of his notoriously gaffe - prone grandfather , prince @entity17 , the third in line to the throne entertained a group of young sports hopefuls in the gardens of @entity24 with a host of asides about the @entity27			1
@entity28 of his list was mr @entity7 who was left cringing after the prince reminded him about his by now infamous tv blunder when a bell he was ringing at an event to celebrate the opening of the @entity5 flew off its handle – and narrowly avoided hitting a group of women			1
every one of you here today are now the leaders of that legacy whether you like it or not ... ‘ i urge you to pick up the torch , or in @entity7 's case , the bell , and i expect to see your faces again when you stand on the podium at @entity68 and beyond			1
’ the crowd roared at the politician ’s obvious embarrassment , but mr @entity7 appeared to take the teasing with good grace			1
@entity1 had another dig again later when he told a group of young athletes : ‘ i hope you 've all got tickets to watch your events ’ before gesturing at @entity7 and adding : ‘ if not , this is your man			1
’ the @entity49 is a year - round school sports initiative which uses the inspiration of @entity82 ’s @entity5 and @entity83 to transform competitive sport in schools and get more people playing sport			1
culture secretary @entity7 introduced @entity1 to guests the heir then poked fun at the minister , particularly his recent bell - ringing gaffe thousands of schools across the country have signed up to take part in local class versus class and school versus school competitions , along with county wide sports festivals the first @entity49 finals saw 1,600 elite young athletes compete in four @entity5 venues : the @entity106 , the @entity107 , the @entity108 and the @entity109			1
prince @entity1 is president of the @entity49 and is using his support to highlight the role that competitive sport can play in the development of young people			2
@entity1 , who was also joined by @entity115 medallists @entity114 and @entity116 , as well as current @entity118 weightlifter @entity117 , was relaxed and chatty as he circulated among the young people aged 13 to 16 and their families			2
@entity1 told a group of children : ‘ we saw what that @entity15 girl did , she knocked five seconds off her time - apparently teenagers can do that			1
’ pointing at 16 - year - old @entity127 he said : ‘ if they can you 'll be running in seven seconds			1
’ the teenager , who attends @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity130 won two gold medals in the @entity49 - one for the 200m and one for the 4x100m relay			2
prince @entity1 poked fun at @entity7 's bell - ringing gaffe @entity1 urged the youngsters to emulate the success of 16 - year - old @entity15 swimming sensation @entity14 he said : ‘ it was a good experience to meet prince @entity1			1
‘ he said good luck to me and he 's looking forward to seeing me in 2016			2
’ @entity1 went on to tell the assembled guests : ‘ hopefully you ’ll grow and grow and grow to be very famous and then we can beat @entity15			0
’ @entity114 , who won a gold in the 4 x 100m relay in @entity149 , added : ‘ it 's amazing to be here to hopefully inspire the next generation			0
‘ to meet some of the young athletes is amazing , some of these will go onto fly the flag for our country			2
‘ it 's special to have prince @entity1 involved			0
it shows how important sport is to this country to have someone like him			0
‘ he seems to have a connection with these young people and he 's in touch			0
‘ i asked him who he thinks will win the 100 metres			0
i think his money 's on @entity172			0
’ asked by the current games he added : ‘ the rowing yesterday was fantastic , it 's always a special achievement being the first @entity175 to achieve a gold , especially in these circumstances where we expect it to come from elsewhere			0
‘ we can be a nation of moaners			0
we usually moan about the weather			0
‘ but i think it 's right the public want to see your first gold			0
‘ we 've been talking up this games and our heroes for so long and rightfully so we expect to see gold medals and medals won by @entity192 , that 's how we 're going to inspire the next generation of champions			0
‘ but at the same time it just goes to show that these medals are not easy , people all round the world are prepared and work just as hard as our athletes so the margins are so close			2
