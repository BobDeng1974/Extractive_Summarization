this cheeky pup thought it was in for a snack when it found a cookie wrapper floating in the water at @entity12 , @entity13			1
but its mother was soon on the scene and , perhaps worried that the cub was going to choke , managed to coax it away from the trash			0
eye for a bargain : the otter chews on the discarded cookie packet which is marked @entity22 otter you up to ? mother coaxes her young whelp away from the packet cookie cuter : the adorable otter is not keen on giving up its treat - even though the packet is empty photographer @entity31 captured the sight of the youngster trying to nibble the packet last month			1
he said : ' a baby sea otter pup got a hold of a plastic cookie wrapper and tried to eat it			1
' like a human baby that reaches for a nearby object and puts it in his or her mouth , it is a familiar and , perhaps , terrifying sight for any parent			0
' after a couple of minutes of wrestling with the wrapper , the pup tucked the piece of plastic under its armpit as mom carried the pup away			2

current affairs : the otter appears to be holding the packet like a newspaper as it floats along in the water do n't cry ! the otter almost seems to be shedding a tear as it gives up on the packet following mom 's orders come here ! mother otter decides she needs to take a firm hold of her pup ' i lost track of the wrapper , but when the pair returned a couple of minutes later , the plastic was gone and the pup was happily nursing from its mother and climbing on her head			1
' @entity31 and local conservation groups are used to seeing the effect that man has on the local @entity13 sea otter population			1
he explained : ' most people that have seen these pictures experience a wide range of emotions - everything from sadness to anger			0
' it is bad for any wildlife to get a hold of trash			0
it is even worse when it is baby wildlife			0
and in this particular case , it is compounded by the fact that the @entity13 sea otter is an endangered species			1
' i still love you , mom : all is forgiven , as the otter gives his mother a hug ... although it does n't look very comfortable for her !			2
