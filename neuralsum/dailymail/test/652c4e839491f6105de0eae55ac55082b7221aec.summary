as @entity0 prepares to play his 100th test - needing only three wickets to equal @entity5 ’s @entity4 - record haul of 383 - @entity7 's @entity6 spoke to those who knew him and played with him in his early days for @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity4			1
@entity4 quick @entity0 plays his 100th test match in @entity12 against the @entity13 from monday @entity0 needs just three wickets to go level with sir @entity5 as @entity4 's top test wicket taker @entity17 @entity19 team - mate , now club chairman we used to call @entity0 the ‘ @entity22 ’			1
playing in the @entity23 , he ’d regularly get the opposition professional out			1
he was quite a slight kid			1
it was probably when he was 17 that we thought , wow , he ’s got some pace			1
and he had this ability to bowl jaffas			1
when he bowled so brilliantly against @entity30 in the 2003 @entity32 everyone at @entity9 was saying : ‘ we ’ve seen these magic balls before			1
’ @entity0 was known as @entity22 during his days with @entity9 , reveals former team - mate and now club chairman @entity17 my mum can take some of the credit for @entity0 being signed by @entity10			1
he was bowling really well for @entity9 , and she rang up @entity38 , who was at the club at the time			1
@entity0 was invited for trials by @entity10 and that was that			1
he was always a shy lad			1
but he cares very much			1
@entity43 former @entity10 player development manager his potential was brought to my attention by @entity48 so i ’m not going to take credit for unearthing @entity0			1
i did n’t necessarily think he ’d be the bowler he is today but there was just something about him			1
when he arrived for under 17 nets he was a shy introvert but with the ability to bowl at good pace			2
but it was the late swing that stood out			2
even established batsmen struggled to line him up			1
they were playing and missing all the time			2
he made them look ordinary			2
in the early days i just left him alone			2
he had these unusual mannerisms , like not looking at the batsman at the point of delivery , and a strange rotation of the shoulders			2
but i ignored all that even when coaches at other counties were pointing it out			2
i just said : ‘ we ’ve got a 17 - year - old bowling 80mph and getting the top three out ! ’ @entity73 @entity0 ’s first captain at @entity10 and wicketkeeper he burst on to the scene in my first year as captain			1
there was talk of this kid from the valleys in @entity10			2
he would n’t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light with the funniest action			2
he bowled to me in a centre net practice at @entity87 and was either turning me inside out or hitting me on the shin			2
i thought : ‘ either i ’m losing it or this kid ’s special ’			1
we sat down with coach @entity93 and tried to work out how to set fields that were both attacking and defensive at the same time in case he sent down the odd poor ball			2
so we ’d have three slips , a gully and a deep point			2
it gave him confidence to concentrate on how to be a fast bowler			2
he went from strength to strength			2
@entity0 ( back row second from left ) ' would n’t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light , ' says his 2002 @entity10 captain @entity73 ( front row fifth from left ) he was a keeper ’s dream			1
he was in the high - 80s and took the ball away so i always thought i was going to get a nick			2
that said , he was partly responsible for ending my career a few games early			2
he bowled @entity120 down at @entity121 and i dislocated a thumb after the ball ricocheted off the bails			2
but i could console myself with the thought that i ’d kept to @entity4 ’s best			1
@entity93 @entity0 ’s first coach at @entity10 i was coaching the @entity10 second team when @entity0 arrived			1
he had wicked pace back then - probably even more than he has now - but he could be a little inconsistent			1
some would swing , others would n’t			0
i ’d been a swing bowler myself before changing to spin and i did some work with him before one game at @entity133			0
i tried to convey to him the importance of the relationship between the ball and the fingertips			0
he related to it straight away			0
since then , he ’s worked things out for himself			1
@entity0 ’s been his own best coach			1
@entity141 @entity0 ’s first first - class victim : @entity10 v @entity143 , @entity87 , may 31 , 2002 he was then as he is now - as lithe as a whippet			1
his run - up was the same			0
i just remember him being quality			0
he had this very fast arm which was difficult to pick up at first			0
to me , a left - hander , it was an awayswinger			0
i remember getting one that was too good for me and edged it to @entity73			0
@entity154 commentator @entity141 ( left with @entity155 ) was @entity0 's first first - class victim i thought ‘ christ , this guy can bowl ! ’ in those days @entity10 had @entity158 and @entity159 and we were n’t expecting them to go on forever			1
we thought , they ’ve found another one already			0
that was the talk in the @entity143 dressing - room			0
and when he got ramps in the second innings you could see he had something different			0
@entity170 dismissed first ball in the second innings of the above match i faced his first couple of balls in the first innings and they were wide of off stump			1
but they went through noticeably quickly and hit the keeper ’s gloves quite hard			1
he was swinging it and getting it through at a good lick			0
@entity170 , now @entity4 batting coach , was dismissed lbw with the first ball of the second innings in the second innings he gave me a straight one first ball			1
it was fast and swinging in and it hit me plumb in front			0
i was beaten for pace and a little bit of inswing , or maybe reverse			0
it was a terrific delivery			0
you tend to remember when a young man comes in and does that straight away			0
it raised a few eyebrows			0
at the @entity203 against @entity204 last summer i was sitting on the team balcony as batting coach and i could n’t remember a better exhibition of swing bowling			0
to witness that live was amazing			0
@entity210 @entity0 ’s first @entity4 captain , in 2002 - 03 he came into the team after yet another @entity214 disaster			1
he was a breath of fresh air , a natural talent - very un-english ! he was n’t over-coached or too technical			0
he just ran in and bowled swing			0
he was the kind of player you might get from @entity30			0
@entity0 and his first @entity4 captain @entity210 celebrate a wicket during the 2003 @entity32 for such a young lad , he was n’t someone you needed to over-manage or look after			1
he was incredibly quiet but he knew exactly what he wanted to do			0
if anything i probably had such a good impression of him that i gave him more responsibility than i should have done - like bowling him instead of @entity230 at the end of our @entity32 game against @entity234 at @entity235 in 2003			1
he got hit for six and i apologised to him later			0
he was playing pool , shrugged his shoulders , and got on with his game			0
but i knew he was going to be one of our greats			0
it ’s one thing being a swing bowler but it ’s the way he could get it to go so late			1
i faced him just once and he got me first ball at @entity87 as part of a hat - trick			0
he ’s a very clever cricketer			1
@entity247 man of the match on @entity0 ’s test debut against @entity251 at @entity252 in 2003 @entity0 celebrates the wicket of @entity251 's @entity255 with @entity256 ( right ) and @entity257 ( left ) during his debut test at @entity252 in may 2003 , in which @entity247 claimed five wickets and man of the match like @entity0 , i took five wickets in that game			1
i like to think i taught him everything he knows about swing bowling			0
this was the first time i ’d seen him close up			0
he swung it both ways and at serious pace			0
i thought , we ’ve found one here			0
i took a catch off him			0
@entity273 was trying to work one through square - leg but he nicked it to slip			0
it was a cracking delivery			0
it ’s an easy thing to do when you ’re new to get your bouncer through quickly , then send down something a bit floaty when you bowl a fuller length			1
but his full balls were coming out at a good pace too			0

@entity0 plays his 100th test match in @entity12 starting monday
the quick needs four *scalps* to become @entity4 top test wicket taker
he was called ' @entity22 ' as a teen *knocking* over batsmen for @entity9
@entity247 recalls @entity0 's test debut at @entity300 ’s back in 2003
