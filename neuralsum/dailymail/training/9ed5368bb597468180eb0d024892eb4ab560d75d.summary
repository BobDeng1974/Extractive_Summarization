it looks like the sort of cartoon car that @entity3 might drive			0
but this is the computerised ‘ hands - free ’ self - driving bubble car planned by @entity5			1
the car has no steering wheel , brake or accelerator pedals , just buttons for start , pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing your route			1
@entity5 hopes to have 100 of the revolutionary two - seater electric - powered vehicles on roads within a year – provided the law allows them			1
@entity5 plans to have prototypes ready to test later this summer and says the goal is for the car to ‘ shoulder the entire burden of driving ’			1
@entity5 says the car has a ‘ friendly ’ face to give a non-threatening appearance and help the public accept the new technology			2
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians			2
speed is restricted to 25mph and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity5 road maps tested on the company ’s current fleet of vehicles			1
this works by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s exact position on an electronic map			0
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ‘ view ’ , with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘ see ’ and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights			1
happy customers : a company video showed test subjects taking a spin in the car , and their delighted reactions to the sensation of being transported without the need to control the car clever : rather than reworking an existing vehicle , the tech giant is building its own contraption with the goal that it can ' shoulder the entire burden of driving ' self - driving cars work by using gps technology to locate the vehicle 's exact position on an electronic map			1
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ' view '			0
these sensors are linked to computer software that is able to ' see ¿ and identify people , cars and road signs the computer brain is programmed with road rules and guides the car to a chosen destination			2
it combines technology mainstream car manufacturers – including @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117 – have been working on and which already exists in modern cars , such as autonomous braking , adaptive cruise control and lane recognition			0
the biggest obstacle could be the law			0
by the end of this year , @entity125 ’s @entity124 plans to implement regulations for the use of driverless cars			0
four @entity131 states – @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity125 , and @entity134 – have passed laws permitting autonomous cars			0
project director @entity137 said the cars will revolutionise driving , helping to remove the ‘ human error ’ blamed for nine out of ten crashes			1
he said : ‘ this is a first step for us			0
it ’s going to be incredibly empowering			0
they wo n’t have a steering wheel , accelerator pedal , or brake pedal … because they do n’t need them			1
our software and sensors do all the work			2
’ @entity5 car safety director @entity154 , former deputy director of the @entity155 , said road deaths could be drastically reduced by removing human driver error			2
‘ it has the potential to be the most important safety technology the auto industry has ever seen , ’ he said			0
but computer experts warned the reliance on software could lead to ‘ spam jams ’ and gridlock caused by computer hackers			0
@entity170 , director at @entity172 ’s cyber security team , said : ‘ self - drive cars will probably work through internet connectivity and , just as large volumes of electronic traffic can be routed to overwhelm websites , the opportunity for self - drive traffic being routed to create “ spam jams ” or disruption is a very real prospect			2
’ safety first : the company is currently building some prototypes that are designed to operate safely and autonomously without requiring human intervention perceiving the environment ? the vehicle uses gps and sensor information to work out its location what 's around me ? sensors pick up information about the environment including pedestrians , cyclists , vehicles , signage etc. what should i do ? the software chooses a safe speed for the car and moves the vehicle in a natural way what should i do ? the software chooses a safe speed for the car and moves the vehicle in a natural way			1

rather than reworking an existing vehicle , the tech giant is building its own
the cars wo *n't* have a steering wheel , accelerator pedal , or brake pedal
' our software and sensors do all the work , ' self - driving project director @entity137 says
they will simply have a stop - go button and a screen showing the route
@entity5 wants to build about a hundred prototype vehicles , and begin testing them later this summer
