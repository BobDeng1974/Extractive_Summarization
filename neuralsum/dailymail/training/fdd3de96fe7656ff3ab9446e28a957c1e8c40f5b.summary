click here to read former @entity3 coach @entity2 's column following the heartbreaking news of @entity6 ' death you never expect something like this to happen in your game			1
yes , we have seen serious injury in cricket and yes people have died playing the game , but i just did not believe it could happen to a professional in the modern , helmeted era			2
this is an absolute tragedy for the family of @entity6 , his friends and the whole cricket community			1
it will stay forever with those team - mates and opponents who were on the field with him at the @entity29 on tuesday			2
i have seen people hit on the head in a cricket match and thought , ‘ @entity33 that ’s bad			2
’ but if a batsman is knocked down you always expect them to get back up again			0
you do n’t expect them to stay down , like poor @entity6 did			1
but i know that if i was playing now i would be feeling very different about what could happen the next time i went out to bat			0
you are taught as a batsman to keep your eye on the ball but if you can not hit it then your instinct when batting or fielding at short leg is to turn your head away , as @entity6 did at the @entity29 when he went through with the shot too early			2
you do it as an act of self - preservation if you can not hit the ball or get out of the way of it but it can expose the back of your head and neck where @entity6 was hit			1
i was always told that your temple was the area in most need of protection , not the back of the head			0
this will make everybody who plays the game at any level think again , not to mention the manufacturers who try to make helmets as effective as they can be			2
@entity83 's @entity82 ( left ) commentates during the toss before the 2013 third @entity43 at @entity85 as @entity3 captain @entity86 ( middle ) invites @entity39 counterpart @entity88 to call if anything , short leg fielders are even more vulnerable than batsmen because you are in the lap of the gods fielding there			1
i would urge all cricketers , young and old , to think about their safety as much as they possibly can			1
as i said here the other day , it is in the nets or watching others bat where you can be most at risk			0
keep your eye on the ball at all times			0
i did n’t know @entity6 well but those who did say he was a terrific lad who was very popular among his team - mates and throughout the game , not only in @entity109 but in @entity3 and wherever else he played			1
he was a little fighter on the field , as we saw with the way he overcame technical issues to be on the brink of a @entity43 comeback with @entity109 , but this was one fight he just could not win			0
it really was a freak accident			0
the @entity119 , @entity6 ' home ground , pays poignant tribute after the news broke on thursday @entity123 have a tricky decision to make as to whether next week ’s first test against @entity126 should go ahead at the @entity127			1
how can people like @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 , who were there at the @entity29 with @entity6 , holding their dying friend in their arms , possibly think about playing now ? i think it should come down to each individual ’s decision			1
the @entity125 could be held as a tribute to @entity6 but if any of the players do not feel in the right frame of mind to play again so soon then that will obviously be respected by everyone			2
should the game change ? well , protective equipment will inevitably be looked at but there is only so far you can go with helmets			0
if they are so heavy and comprehensive that they can effect movement or vision then they could do more harm than good			0
it is a balancing act			0
maybe the game needs to look at intimidatory bowling at tail - enders too			1
we used to giggle when we saw someone like @entity161 backing away from fast bowlers but this tragedy puts that very much into context			1
what i would say is that fast bowling is one of the great attractions of cricket			0
watching @entity171 last winter was absolutely exhilarating , the best part of the @entity43			0
it is a great skill and not one that can be taken away from cricket			0
@entity123 will take stock , do everything it can do , but ultimately it will carry on			0
for now all we can do is offer every sympathy to @entity6 ’s family and friends who are going through something no cricketer ’s loved ones ever should			1
@entity6 ( left ) congratulates @entity185 ( right ) after the @entity39 no 11 reaches 50 against @entity3 in 2013 @entity187 dies from head injuries			1

former @entity3 captain @entity190 says the @entity6 tragedy will make every cricketer think again
' i would urge all cricketers , young and old , to think about their safety as much as they possibly can '
@entity82 : ' the game needs to look at intimidatory bowling at tail - enders too *...* this puts that very much into context '
' all we can do is offer every sympathy to @entity6 ’s family and friends '
