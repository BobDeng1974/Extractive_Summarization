the last rites for the @entity2 ’s doomed international committee are effectively being played out over the current week of @entity4 matches			1
the committee , who used to be responsible for running the @entity4 team as well as hiring and firing managers , are now barely carrying out their marginalised ambassador role			1
instead of the three councillors who usually accompany the @entity4 team , there was only @entity13 ’s @entity12 with the senior side in @entity15			1
and none of the 12 - strong committee have travelled with @entity4 ’s @entity18 to @entity19 for the second leg of their @entity21 qualifying play - off on tuesday			1
only one @entity2 councillor watched @entity4 's 1 - 0 victory ( thanks to @entity26 ) in @entity15 on sunday night even more farcically for the @entity27 , who have n’t met since 2011 , is that they were overhauled last summer to bring in club chief executives such as @entity32 ’s @entity31 and @entity34 ’s invisible @entity33 , who have n’t the time or inclination to go on @entity4 trips			1
meanwhile , some experienced blazers free of work pressures have been booted off international duties			0
former @entity27 stalwarts call the policy a ‘ disgrace ’ , saying there will be long - term damage to the @entity2 ’s standing around the world if the meeting and greeting is abandoned			2
there has been concern expressed by @entity4 sponsors about agent @entity53 starting sports management agency @entity54 that represents @entity55 , when he also oversees the 1966 operation looking after the combined commercial interests of the @entity4 squad			1
but @entity53 says the @entity2 have agreed his twin role and he would not jeopardise the relationships he has built up with agents over 20 years by attempting to sign their @entity4 players			1
@entity53 adds the new agency is not just about football but attracting stars from other sports including rugby and golf			2
@entity55 's agent @entity53 has dismissed fears of @entity4 sponsors @entity74 's flying winger @entity73 made a swift return from @entity4 duty after the win the @entity2 were saying before the @entity15 match that there was n’t a single incident last week of a club persuading a player to pull out of representing his country during an international round of fixtures involving games at senior , under 21 , @entity88 , and @entity90 level			1
but that was before @entity74 ’s @entity73 said he was too tired to start against @entity15 , for whatever reason			2
fortunately the @entity4 team charter back from @entity94 stopped off first at @entity95 to allow the @entity97 players , including @entity73 , the quickest journey home — although the flight arrangements were made before all the fuss kicked off about @entity73			2
100m follow @entity101 @entity103 galactico @entity101 , the sports darling of social media , will sometime today become the first athlete to have 100million @entity108 followers			0
this puts him nearly 30m fans in front of @entity113 ’s @entity112 , his rival for world no 1 footballer			0
the commercial power of @entity101 , who also has 30.5m @entity118 followers , was demonstrated when he posted six messages over two days advertising the @entity121 watch brand			0
these received 34.9m @entity108 hits and 2.4m likes , valued at more than £ 300,000 by the watch company			0
@entity101 will celebrate reaching 100 million @entity108 followers on tuesday @entity126 , the @entity2 ’s director of elite development , has been effectively anointed the body ’s new technical director by @entity129			0
@entity2 chairman @entity129 said @entity126 , who has made his mark quickly since arriving from @entity131 , would be filling that all - powerful role when explaining the new command structure for operating his @entity135 grass - roots reforms			2
@entity136 , whose owner @entity137 has ploughed more than £ 150million into the club , have been given the top rating of any team in the country for their academy , part of a new £ 30million training facility			0
no wonder @entity137 is impatient for his go - ahead outfit to be doing far better than 19th in the @entity147			0
@entity148 will be on the panel at a sports writing festival at @entity151 a sports writing festival at @entity151 partly organised by the @entity153 has footballer @entity148 and his ghost writer @entity154 on one of its guest panels a week on saturday , but no booking for cricketer @entity158 , who was unavailable to talk about his new publication .			0
