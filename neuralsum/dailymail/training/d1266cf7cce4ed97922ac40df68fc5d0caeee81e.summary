by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:30 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 9 december 2013 food prices in the biggest supermarkets will rise if @entity5 backs independence , retail giants have warned			1
big name stores like @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 's absorb the higher costs of doing business in @entity5 so that prices are the same across the @entity14			1
but if voters decide to go it alone in next year ’s referendum , @entity5 would be treated like other overseas operations where prices are higher			2
costs : prices in leading supermarkets will rise in an independent @entity5 , industry bosses have warned longer travel distances between depots and stores in @entity5 increase transport costs to good food onto shelves			1
companies which sell alcohol and cigarettes also pay higher business rates			2
there have already been claims that an independent @entity5 will pay higher energy , mortgage and tax bills			0
but the warning that the weekly shop will also be more costly is likely to alarm people who have paid little attention to the debates about currency unions and @entity45 negotiations			0
a senior executive at one of the @entity49 supermarkets said : ‘ we would treat it as an international market and act accordingly by putting up our prices			0
‘ the costs of distribution are much higher in @entity5 but at the moment that gets absorbed by the @entity14 business			1
’ each of the national grocers have the same prices in stores of the same size , whether it is in @entity63 or @entity64			0
but the ‘ national pricing ’ policy would end if @entity5 became a separate country , and would instead be treated as a foreign outpost			1
@entity9 boss @entity69 said shoppers in @entity71 and @entity72 should not subsidise prices in @entity5 while @entity8 chief executive @entity74 said costs vary across the @entity14 @entity74 , chief executive of @entity8 , said : ‘ at @entity8 , we believe in fairness so the price customers pay for a pint of milk or loaf of bread is the same regardless of where they live in the @entity14			1
‘ however the cost of doing business in different parts of the country does vary			0
‘ a yes vote in 2014 could result in @entity5 being a less attractive investment proposition for business , and put further pressure on our costs			2
' @entity69 , chief executive of @entity9 said : ‘ if the regulatory environment was to increase the burden of the cost structure on business , that would potentially have to be passed through to consumer pricing , because why should the @entity71 and @entity72 consumer subsidise this increased cost of doing business in @entity5 ? ’ a spokesman for @entity106 said : ' we ’ve got a great business in @entity5 and our job is to create the best offer for customers whatever the outcome of the referendum			1
' the @entity5 government insists there is ‘ no reason ’ for food prices to rise , claiming ‘ @entity5 would be more competitive and less costly than at present ’			2
@entity5 's first minister @entity118 used his launch of his blueprint for independence to boast that the @entity5 food and drink sector would thrive last month energy secretary @entity124 warned households in an independent @entity5 would pay more for energy			0
he said : ‘ if @entity5 votes for independence , and there can be no guarantee of support for renewables in @entity5 from @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity133 consumers , @entity5 consumers and industry could see price rises			1
’ last month @entity118 launched his blueprint for independence , insisting @entity5 ’s food and drink sector would thrive			0
it stated : ' @entity5 ’s food and drink industry does an excellent job promoting the @entity5 brand , but @entity5 is constrained by the current constitutional settlement from directly engaging on a level footing with other countries			0
' @entity146 will boost @entity5 ’s international profile , delivering new opportunities for food and drink exports , as well as attracting new visitors to our country to enjoy our produce			0

transport and business rates make it more costly to trade in @entity5
big name stores currently charge the same prices across the @entity14
but if @entity5 backs independence the ' national pricing ' will end
@entity9 : @entity71 and @entity72 shoppers should not subsidise @entity5
@entity8 chief executive @entity74 said business costs vary across the @entity14
