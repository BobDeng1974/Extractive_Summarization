by @entity0 last updated at 4:24 pm on 24th february 2012 @entity3 's @entity2 - born prime minister @entity1 faces a shootout against her former foreign minister @entity5 after he challenged her leadership			1
but miss @entity1 is convinced she has the support of the @entity8 to see off mr @entity5 - the man she ousted for the top job in 2010			1
mr @entity5 resigned as foreign minister on tuesday while he was in @entity11 , raising speculation that he would challenge miss @entity1 when her cabinet meets on monday			1
in october , mr @entity5 led by 61 per cent to 30 per cent			0
about one - quarter of those who back mr @entity5 do not believe he should run for the leadership			0
source : @entity28 / @entity27 poll mr @entity5 then declined to confirm whether he will take on 50 - year - old miss @entity1 , before confirming he will today			1
he said : ' and starting on monday , i want to start restoring that trust			0
that â€™s why i 've decided to contest the leadership of the @entity19			0
' i want to finish the job the @entity3 people elected me to do when i was elected by them to become prime minister			0
' the pm had said she will hold a ballot for the @entity8 leadership on monday in any case to end all the speculation over who is the best person to hold the the top job - a debate that has been damaging the party according to opinion polls			1
miss @entity1 , who arrived in @entity3 with her parents from @entity48 , in @entity49 , when she was five , said yesterday : ' @entity3 are rightly sick of this			2
we need a leadership ballot to settle this question once and for all			0
' she added that she expected mr @entity5 would be a candidate in the ballot - but was confident that not only would she win it , but would go on to win the next general election due next year			0
refusal : @entity1 ousted @entity5 as prime minister in june 2010 and there has been ongoing tension in the @entity19 in recent weeks over the leadership announcement : mr @entity5 declared his resignation at a press conference in @entity11 , saying he could not continue without ms @entity1 's support she said : ' i am confident that ... we can win that election provided we use monday 's opportunity to end this for all time and then we get on with the job of delivering good government for the @entity3 people			2
mr @entity5 , 54 , has been a thorn in miss @entity1 's side since she gathered enough support to oust him from the prime minister 's job two years ago as he slumped in the opinion polls against the @entity84 - @entity3 's conservative - party			1
as miss @entity1 's popularity also began to slide in the opinion polls , mr @entity5 is understood to have indicated to people close to him that he would try to get his old job back			2
miss @entity1 appointed him as her foreign minister when she took over , but it was in @entity11 at a snap news conference that he announced his resignation from the position			1
unhappy union : recent polls suggest their ongoing battle has been damaging the @entity8 before leaving @entity11 , where he had met @entity97 secretary of state @entity98 , mr @entity5 told reporters that some of his colleagues had told him that they regarded him ' as the best prospect to lead the @entity19 successfully to the next elections '			2
despite miss @entity1 's conviction that she has the support to thwart any leadership challenge by mr @entity5 , former attorney - general @entity105 stepped forward today to declare his support for mr @entity5			1
he said : ' he 's our best prospect to win the next federal election			0
' but @entity8 senator @entity113 used virtually the same words to lend his support to @entity116 , saying she was ' the best person to lead the country and win the next federal election for @entity8 ' .			0
