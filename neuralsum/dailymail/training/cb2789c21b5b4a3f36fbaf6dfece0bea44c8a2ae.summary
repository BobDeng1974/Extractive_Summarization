click here to see the final leaderboard from @entity2 outgoing champion @entity3 will redouble efforts to win next year 's @entity5 after handing back the @entity6			1
@entity3 , who memorably came through the field on the final day to win at @entity8 last year , was unable to retain his crown at @entity2			1
the left - hander finished strongly with a four - under - par 68 but his five - under aggregate left him well short of the leaders			1
' knowing how great it felt to win this tournament makes me want to work harder and get ready for @entity32 next year			1
i ca n't think of a better site , or golf course , to win any tournament ever than @entity32			2
' to have the @entity5 back there is a great opportunity and i will be working hard to try to get it back			2
' @entity3 arrived at @entity18 having not won a tournament since his success at @entity8			1
under the weather : @entity3 did not do enough over his four rounds to challenge the leaderboard it has been an unusually lean spell for the 44 - year - old but he is confident his touch is returning			1
he said : ' i thought i played well today			0
i did n't give any shots away and i shot what i thought i should shoot out there			0
' it was a solid round of four under and it was a good way for me to get a little bit of confidence			0
' i did n't score as well as i could but i played as well as i could , so my game 's not too far off			0
' but to win this tournament you need to not only play great golf but have a few breaks and some luck			0
' all smiles : he has vowed to return better next year for @entity5 at @entity32 @entity3 remains outside the automatic qualification places for the @entity23 ' @entity64 team			1
should he not make it most would expect captain @entity66 to name him as one of his wildcard picks , but @entity3 is determined to win a spot outright			2
@entity3 , a member of every @entity23 team since 1995 , said : ' it does matter to me - it has been 19 years now where i have made it on my own			1
' it is a record of consistency to play that well , to make it without being a pick , and i 'd like to keep that streak going			0
' i ca n't really control the points too much but if i play like i did this week at @entity81 ( @entity82 ) and the ( @entity23 ) @entity83 ( @entity5 ) i 'll be fine , i 'll be on it			2
' it will be beneficial for both me and @entity66 if i can do it on my own			0
' if i do n't get in on my own i do n't know if i 'll have played well enough this year to deserve a spot			0
' you want players who are hot and playing well , and i need to step up and do that			0

@entity3 memorably *mounted* a late charge on the final day to win at @entity8 last year
but the @entity23 left - hander was unable to retain his title at @entity18
he shot a final - round 68 but that was not enough to put him in contention
he described his final score of five - under - par as ' disappointing ' but *promised* to *increase* his efforts to win @entity5 at @entity32 next year
