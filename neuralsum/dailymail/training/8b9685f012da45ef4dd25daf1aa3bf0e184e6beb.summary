by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 9 november 2013 it certainly beats earplugs - although it 's a costly alternative			0
@entity3 will shell out £ 1.8 million to build sound - proof igloos in nearby schools to protects pupils ' and teachers ' ears from aircraft noise , after a successful trial at a school that lies within the flight path			1
the airport plans to give 21 local schools £ 85,000 each so that they can build the adobe domes to muffle the noise , so that children can play outside and enjoy lessons outdoors			1
students from @entity20 infants school play around one of four adobe huts designed to help minimise the noise of aircraft landing at @entity3 the playground is directly under the flight path of @entity3 's southern runway and outside play for the children is interrupted every two minutes or so by landing aircraft passing over their heads the domes are an invention of @entity37 architect @entity36 and were originally meant for lunar settlements			1
they were first employed in a refugee crisis after the 1990 - 91 @entity41 , but they work just fine forchildren in west @entity44 too			2
the domes , which have also been installed in the @entity47 foothills of @entity48 , are made out of bags of coiled earth tubes in an igloo - shape			0
the technology avoids using expensive construction materials and the cost of transporting them			0
@entity56 dug from the construction site is compressed into tubular bags which are laid one on top of the other to form walls			0
barbed wire is placed between the layers to hold the bags together			0
the bags are laid in a circle with a decreasing diameter of the rows towards the top			0
since 2005 , the airport has been handing out some funds to schools to sound - proof their buildings - but local councils have argued that it is not enough to provide both noise insulation and ventilation , the @entity70 reported			1
the airport , which is the fourth busiest in the world , sees on average 1,288 flights arrive and depart from its five terminals - the equivalent of 471,000 flights a year			2
primary schools that are affected by 63 decibels and above are eligible for the adobe building funding as @entity3 says they recognise the importance of outdoor learning			1
another educational establishments will be given financial help to sound proof their buildings , a @entity91 spokesman said			0
the number of schools and colleges affected is 43 , @entity3 said			1
seven nurseries , four libraries , four community / village halls and six hospices / nursing homes also fall within the zone			0
the decision comes after one primary school close to @entity3 erected ' @entity106 ' shaped domes to shut out the din			1
@entity20 infants ' school built four igloo - like adobe domes in its grounds , a type normally used in earthquakes and emergency zones , to muffle the noise			2
the playground is directly under the flight path of @entity3 's southern runway and outside play for the children is interrupted every two minutes or so by landing aircraft passing over their heads			1
the domes , an invention of @entity37 architect @entity36 , were originally meant for lunar settlements the domes have no doors so are an open space but have a ' strong psychological and physical barrier ' against the noise ' when children were playing outside , they had nowhere to go - they were subjected to that noise , ' said the school 's principal @entity134			1
the domes are an invention of @entity37 architect @entity36 and were originally meant for lunar settlements - but they are so effective in shutting out noise they have been used in the playground			1
' for play time it 's fantastic that they have somewhere to withdraw - even the ones that are too young to articulate that they 're feeling concerned about the noise , ' ms @entity134 said			1
the domes have no doors so are an open space but with a ' strong psychological and physical barrier ' against the noise , she said			2
she estimates that when outside , teachers are inaudible to pupils for 25 seconds in every 90 because of the jets			0
' you can still hear the planes in the huts but you can also hear your own voice , ' she said			2
the school teaches 520 infants aged between three and seven and its experiment with the domes has prompted others in the area to consider following suit			0
the domes , which have also been installed in the @entity47 foothills of @entity48 , are made out of bags of coiled earth tubes in an igloo - shape the domes were first employed in a refugee crisis after the 1990 - 91 @entity41 - but have become a saviour at playtime planes pass just 180 metres ( 600 ft ) over the area and their engines emit a noise level of 87 decibels			1
sound tests inside the domes showed a noise reduction of over 17 decibels and a considerable reduction in the duration of the noise , according to the website of @entity186 which makes the structures			0
aircraft noise is a thorny political issue for the government , as it tries to establish where and how to expand airport capacity			0
business leaders and airlines are pressing him to expand @entity3 , a move which would affect the 750,000 people living under the flight path			2
the resilient but lightweight huts have been erected in @entity48 - and are now popping up in west @entity44 the domes , which have been installed in the @entity47 foothills , are made out of bags of coiled earth tubes in an igloo - shape @entity3 has been making efforts to tackle the noise the inevitably arises from its airport options for increasing capacity at @entity3 include a third runway and allowing planes to land and take - off on its two runways at the same time instead of the current alternating pattern			1
' having quiet time is absolutely critical			0
to lose runway alternation would be a disaster , ' said @entity134			0
@entity3 has been making efforts to tackle the noise the inevitably arises from its airport			1
it has launched a programme critiquing airlines according to their noise performance			0
every three months a ' @entity224 ' table will take the top 50 @entity3 airlines ( by number of flights per quarter ) and list them according to six noise related criteria			1
the airlines receive a red / amber / green rating for each criterion , as well as an overall score which allows airlines to understand how they are performing in relation to other airlines			0
' if they are not meeting the minimum performance targets , @entity3 will work closely with them to improve their rating .			2

@entity3 will give 21 primary schools average of £ 85,000 each
huts allow children to play and learn outside without noise interference
originally designed for lunar landings and used in refugee camps
