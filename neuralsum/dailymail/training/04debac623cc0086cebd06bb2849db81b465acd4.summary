@entity0 , the teenage 800 metres star who shot to prominence by breaking the two - minute barrier last year , takes on the might of female @entity5 middle - distance running at the @entity7 ’s @entity6 with a point to prove			1
@entity9 finished fourth at the @entity5 championships last month , beaten by @entity13 ’s @entity12 champion @entity11 and @entity15 duo @entity14 and @entity16 , all of whom are competing at @entity19			1
@entity20 , 21 , is also dropping down to the two - lap race after setting a @entity13 1500m record in @entity23 last week			2
it promises to be quite a battle , less than three weeks from the 800m final at the @entity27 in the same stadium , with selection for august ’s @entity10 also at stake			0
hair we go : @entity9 took inspiration from @entity34 and is now gunning for @entity6 glory @entity9 , 19 , has already lowered her lifetime best to 1min 59.77sec in @entity37 this year , but she ’s determined this season will not be a repeat of 2013 when she set personal bests in may and june then failed to progress from the heats at the @entity43			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t want to just run fast times in may or june , i want to back it up when it matters			2
the 800m is the most competitive it has been for ages			0
everyone ’s there , and everyone can come out and run a fast time			0
the competition in @entity54 is brilliant and the fact there are so many of us is only going to make it better			2
’ @entity9 has sought guidance from marathon world record - holder @entity34 following three ‘ unbelievably hard ’ months without running after suffering a stress fracture in her back in november			1
she turned her ankle during a cross-country run in @entity65 but carried on training before feeling ‘ like a ghost ’ and realising her back was the problem			2
@entity9 could not run on christmas day for the first time in memory , nor by her 19th birthday in january , and drove her parents mad ‘ bouncing off the walls ’ , desperate to get back on the track			1
she was also frustrated that her plan to take a gap year and delay her place at @entity79 to read human biology had seen her largely confined to the gym and swimming pool			2
@entity9 said : ‘ i had broken a bone in my back when i fell but i carried on training because i was more focused on my ankle			1
i was gutted ; really despondent			0
‘ @entity34 knew it was really hard for me and she really did get me through it			1
she gave me some really nice shoes for aqua jogging — trainers for the pool , basically			0
it ’s nice to take inspiration from her because she ’s been through it all			0
’ @entity9 genuinely loves running			1
just like @entity34 , she would run even if it were not her job , because it is her passion			1
this is more unusual than you might think for an elite athlete , and @entity9 has had to rely heavily on her coach , former @entity27 5,000m champion @entity103 , to keep her from doing too much , too soon			1
passion : @entity9 genuinely loves running like marathon world record - holder @entity34 the @entity107 athlete speaks with enthusiasm and stands out on the track because her long , brown hair flows behind her when she competes , but her style is distinctive , too			1
she calls it ‘ unpleasant ’ , but the tall , long - limbed @entity9 is simply a little clunky and choppy			1
she and @entity113 have , however , been working in the gym and biomechanics lab to try to alter how she runs			0
@entity9 said : ‘ my running style is very strange			1
i know it ’s not brilliant			0
i look really unpleasant when i run so i ’m trying to make it a bit smoother			0
there will be certain traits i will never get rid of , but i want to be the best in the world			0
‘ we ’ve taken on different types of training to make me stronger			0
i just did runs , press - ups and runs again , but now i ’ve got an elite programme			0
i ’m always busy and i love it			0
i just want more and more			0
’ @entity9 is supported by the @entity130 .			2

@entity9 will take on @entity11 , @entity14 and @entity16 at @entity19
the 19 - year - old is keen to make up for @entity135 *disappointment*
