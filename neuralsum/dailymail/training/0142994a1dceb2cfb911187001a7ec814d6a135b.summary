by @entity1 reporter published : 14:45 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 15:12 est , 5 march 2014 a crossbow - wielding thug is being hunted after he left a pet cat fighting for her life by shooting her straight through the abdomen			1
@entity10 , a two - year - old tabby , was inches from being mortally wounded by the dart shot into her right - hand side , which punctured her intestine and pancreas			1
had it been a couple of inches further forward it would have ripped through her lung - a wound she would have had no chance of surviving			1
emergency : two - year - old tabby @entity10 photographed after her operation to remove the crossbow dart , which left her fighting for her life after it was shot into her right - hand side and punctured her intestine and pancreas @entity10 's owner , @entity27 , found the injured pet lying in her basket while he was getting ready to go to work			1
' i came down at 6.30am and saw she had a big dart sticking out of her , ' said mr @entity27			0
' it must have only just happened because she started to slow down soon after when the adrenaline wore off and the shock took over			2
' mr @entity27 rushed @entity10 to his local vets in @entity37 , @entity38 , where medics operated to remove the dart and patch up her lacerated organs			1
she fought to survive for 72 hours before finally stabilising , but still needed another week of intensive nursing before finally pulling through			0
deeply embedded : an x-ray shows how the crossbow bold went nearly all the way through @entity10 's body vets say @entity10 is likely to make a full recovery from the attack , which happened on february 25			1
' she 's on lots of antibiotics , ' said mr @entity27 , who lives with his wife @entity52 and their other cat @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity38			2
' she 's totally zonked and completely out of it like she 's in a pussycat equivalent of an opium den. ' she has to stay inside for another week until her stitches are taken out			2
' after the callous attack , mr @entity27 is now calling for more controls on and monitoring of the sales of crossbows and air pistols			2
' they can be bought in sports shops or online and anyone can buy them as no proof of age is needed , ' he said			0
' kids have them in town and put pictures up on sheds and shoot right through them			0
' almost the whole dart was inside her and she was so lucky it did n't puncture a lung - she had a very lucky escape			1
' now he wants to find who was responsible for the shooting , which @entity87 is investigating			0
' it happened at an odd time which makes me think it may have been an adult who was fed up with cats pooing in their garden , ' he said			0
@entity10 's owner , @entity27 , found the injured pet lying in her basket while he was getting ready to go to work			1
following surgery , vets say @entity10 is likely to make a full recovery from the attack , which happened last week @entity103 , who treated @entity10 at the @entity105 practice in @entity37 , said : ' incidents like this are fortunately extremely rare and whilst i have seen cats shot with air gun pellets , i have never seen a crossbow injury in my 23 years of practice			1
' she was extremely lucky to survive as the bolt had punctured her intestines and also her pancreas			0
' it was very touch and go for the first 72 hours whether she would survive but after six days of intensive nursing she pulled through and was able to go home			0
' if the bolt had been a couple of inches further forward she may well not have survived			0
' although one sees these incidents on tv and in newspapers it is still shocking to see it in person and to deal with the understandably upset owners			0
