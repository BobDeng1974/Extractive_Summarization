@entity28 prosecutors announced yesterday that they had opened a criminal investigation into the ferry fire and would look into whether negligence had played a role			0
it is still unclear what caused the blaze to break out on a car deck of the @entity12 on sunday , but investigators will focus on whether a lorry packed with olive oil may have triggered the disaster			0
the lorry was too tall for the car deck so that it just fitted in to the allocated area and at one stage during the rough seas its metal roof is reported to have begun scraping the ferry ’s ceiling causing sparks that may have ignited the blaze			0
