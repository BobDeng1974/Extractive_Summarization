months after the death of the @entity3 , its surviving twin is poised to reach the rim of a vast crater to begin a fresh round of exploration			0
driving commands sent up to @entity9 directed the six - wheel rover to make the final push towards @entity12 , a 14mile - wide depression near the @entity15 equator that likely could be its final destination			1
at its current pace and barring any hiccups , @entity9 should roll up to the crater 's edge any day now			1
slowly but surely : @entity9 makes its way to its destination - the @entity15 's vast @entity12 - in this image taken last month			1
it is due to arrive at the equator site any day now the journey , which took nearly three years culminated on tuesday when @entity9 signalled it had arrived at the location dubbed @entity28 in honour of the rover 's twin , which fell silent last year the finish line was a spot along a ridge that the rover team nicknamed @entity28 in honour of @entity9 's lost twin			1
scientist @entity37 , of @entity38 in @entity39 , who is part of the team , said : ' i 'm totally pumped			0
we 've been driving for so long			0
' the milestone injects a sense of adventure back into a mission that wowed the public with colour portraits of the landscape and the unmistakable geologic discoveries of a warm and wetter past			0
the @entity54 rovers parachuted to opposite sides of @entity15 in 2004 for what was a planned three - month mission , but both have operated way beyond expectations			1
explorer : an artist 's impression of what opportunity looks like as it trundles across the @entity15 surface almost there : opportunity used its panoramic camera to capture this view of a portion of @entity12 's rim last week after a drive during the rover 's 2,676th day of working on @entity15 spirit 's journey ended in may after @entity54 ceased trying to contact it			1
it had been trapped in sand and unheard from for more than a year			0
opportunity has been on a driving spree since 2008 after it crawled out of a much smaller crater and trundled south toward @entity12 , stopping occasionally to sightsee and examine rock outcrops			2
unlike the early days of the mission when the public tracked @entity9 's every move , the march to @entity12 has been largely low - key			1
in early 2009 , @entity9 caught its first peek of the uplifted rim on the horizon			2
at the time , scientists were unsure if the rover would make it all the way			0
opportunity lands on @entity15 in 2004			2
this image taken by the rover shows its landing ' bag ' which bounced along the surface carrying the robot @entity97 : opportunity seen here during testing on @entity101 the roughly seven - mile journey took longer than the estimated two years to fulfil			1
opportunity , driving backwards to prevent its right front wheel from wearing out , could not travel as the crow flies because of dangerous obstacles			0
so it took a circuitous route and ended up driving twice the distance			0
project manager @entity109 , of the @entity110 , said @entity12 crater is arguably the most important science target since landing			2
craters are carved by asteroids or comets impacting into the @entity15 surface and exposing geological layers from different points in history			0
@entity12 is the fourth crater that @entity9 will explore and offers the oldest deposits yet			1
opportunity could soon have a friend in the form of @entity54 's new curiosity rover			0

finish line in sight for @entity9 after three - year journey
@entity12 is a 14mile - wide depression near the @entity15 equator
it is likely to be the rover 's final destination
