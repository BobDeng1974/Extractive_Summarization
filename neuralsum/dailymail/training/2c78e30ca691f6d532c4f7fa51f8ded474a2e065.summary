sir @entity0 says @entity2 managers are divided on the whether the away goals rule should remain part of competitions such as the @entity6 and @entity7			1
critics of the rule , introduced for the 1965 - 66 cup - @entity10 , meaning goals scored away from home are worth double say it has become counter-productive and unfair in the subsequent half century			1
' there was a bit of a debate about whether it has any significance today , ' said sir @entity0 after a meeting at the elite coaches ' forum at @entity22 headquarters on thursday			2
' if we go back , say , 30 years , counter-attacking consisted of one or maybe two , players			0
today , counter-attacks have players flooding forward in fives or sixes and really positive , quick passing			0
' the rule first came into play in a second - round @entity52 tie as @entity55 side @entity54 went through at the expense of @entity57 after they were 4 - 4 on aggregate after two legs			1
at the time it was seen as preferable to having a time - consuming play - off or the arbitrary toss of the coin which was sometimes employed , famously sending @entity64 to the @entity6 semi-final in 1965 after two goalless draws against @entity67			1
in the early days of @entity2 competition , when air travel was far less developed and reliable , an away match was an adventure with visiting teams facing unfamiliar , sometimes hostile , conditions			0
away wins were rare and the new rule was an incentive for visiting teams to come out of their shell - but that is far less of a problem now , as playing conditions in most parts of @entity22 are pretty much identical and trips abroad no longer carry the air of intimidation they once did			0
' what is helping is that the state of the pitches , pitches are fantastic nowadays , so coming out of defence with passes is much easier than it was 30 years ago , and you get a better attitude to counter-attack today than you did 30 years ago , ' said @entity0			0
rather than encouraging visiting teams to attack , the fear of conceding a potentially decisive away goal often makes home teams more cautious and the rule also means that some goals turn out to be worth more than others			2
' from a personal point of view , when i was playing at home , i used to say to myself , do n't lose a goal , ' said @entity0			2
last year 's @entity6 saw the away goal scored by @entity28 's @entity31 in their 3 - 1 quarter - final first leg loss to @entity33 at the @entity29 prove the difference in the tie as they won 2 - 0 at home and went through to the semis			1
@entity112 backs @entity114 clubs in @entity22 it 's not too late to play @entity116 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

away goals rule first *implemented* in the 1965 - 66 @entity52
sir @entity0 said @entity2 managers are divided on the rule
@entity55 @entity54 was first to benefit from rule in @entity52
a coin toss sent @entity64 through to @entity6 semi final the year before at the expense of @entity67
@entity28 's away goal in 3 - 1 @entity6 first leg loss *effectively* won the tie against @entity33 last *season* after 2 - 0 *victory* at home
