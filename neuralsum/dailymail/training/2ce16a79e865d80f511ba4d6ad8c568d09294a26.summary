when the camera slid off kitesurfer @entity9 's board as he tackled the waves off @entity11 in the @entity12 , he thought it was gone for good			2
but two and a half months later it was recovered by a spear - fisherman who spotted it while diving on the reef - and not only was it still intact , it had kept right on filming			2
it continued recording from its unique vantage point beneath the waves until the battery finally died			0
the footage gives a fascinating glimpse into the briny deep , with fish darting into view before the currents send the camera skipping across the spiky coral once again			0
