a man who developed kidney failure after swimming in a dirty hotel pool has been given a new lease of life after his father donated one of his organs			1
@entity8 , 23 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was on holiday in @entity12 three years ago when he picked up @entity13 from a swimming pool			1
the infection is thought to have led to him developing kidney failure and left him in desperate need of a transplant			1
@entity8 , 23 , has been saved by his father , @entity18 , 46 , who gave him a new kidney he is now recovering after his father , @entity18 , gave him a new kidney			1
mr @entity8 , who was diagnosed with kidney failure last year , said : ‘ i was at college one day and was playing football when i started to lose colour , feel faint , my heart rate increased and i had swelling in my legs			1
‘ i went to the doctor who initially thought there could be a problem with my heart			0
‘ nothing progressed from that and i felt ok , so i quickly moved on , until one day my girlfriend , @entity33 , made a comment about the appearance of my urine			0
‘ together we looked on the internet at what bubbles in urine means and there was a suggestion of kidney failure			1
‘ under @entity33 ’s instruction i went to see my gp later that week with a urine sample , and that same day the @entity45 referred me to @entity47 in @entity48 and said i needed a biopsy immediately			0
’ mr @entity8 ( pictured in hospital ) is thought to have picked up @entity13 from a hotel swimming pool			1
this bug is then believed to have caused damage to his kidneys mr @entity8 was found to be a suitable kidney donor for his son after six months of tests a biopsy revealed mr @entity8 had severe renal failure and doctors advised he needed a kidney transplant within a year or he would need dialysis			1
about 10 per cent of people who suffer from @entity13 go on to develop a life - threatening complication called @entity66			2
this is one of the most common causes of acute kidney failure in infants and young children and can also cause kidney problems in adults			2
@entity13 multiplies in the intestines and bind to the cells that line it			2
it 's presence allows for the absorption of toxins into the blood which transports it to the kidneys			0
this causes injury to the kidneys resulting in kidney failure			1
if this happens , patients can require a transplant or dialysis			0
source : about @entity66 his cousin and his father were immediately tested and both were matches for a kidney transplant			2
it was decided that mr @entity8 would donate and the father and son underwent successful surgery three weeks ago			1
father - of - one mr @entity8 , a graduate at digital print agency , said : ‘ we decided that my dad would be the donor as thinking strategically my cousin was much younger , therefore should i need a transplant in the future i could lean on him , and the opportunity might not be there with my dad in 20 or so years			2
‘ i was in my final year of university while dad was undergoing the tests and my girlfriend had just had our first born , @entity119			0
‘ my energy levels were noticeably deteriorating which was affecting my concentration at university and at home , so it was a stressful time			0
‘ the past few years have been a bit of a whirlwind , but i ’m looking forward to starting my new position in september and carving a career for both myself and my new family			0
‘ print and photography are a huge passion for me so i can not thank my dad enough for giving me the opportunity to be able to lead a normal life with @entity33 , @entity119 and my career			0
’ @entity136 consultant and martial arts instructor mr @entity8 , 46 , from @entity138 , @entity139 , said : ‘ i was well - prepared for the tests that i had to undergo in order to qualify for the donation			0
the pair ( pictured on mr @entity8 's graduation day while he was waiting for a transplant ) are recovering after having the operation three weeks ago ‘ emotionally the process to be a candidate for kidney donation is like a roller - coaster ride where at every stage you have to undergo tests , and then wait for the results before you progress to the next stage			1
‘ only one person can complete the process at one time so it was a constant worry that i may fail a stage at some point throughout the six - month period , and we would have wasted the one year clock the doctor gave @entity8 to have his transplant in			0
’ surgeon @entity166 is pleased with the outcome of the operation and hopes this transplant will help to promote organ donation amongst ethnic minority groups .			0
