there could be new rules on the use of commercial drones which zip through the sky in the @entity5 making them a part of everyday life , according to plans proposed by the @entity10			1
at some point in the near future drones could perform routine tasks such as aerial photography , mapping , crop monitoring and inspections of cell towers , bridges and other tall structures			1
but they may not be able to do other tasks like deliver pizzas , as safety restrictions will mean drones must be kept within sight of operators at all times and there 'll be no night time flights			1
' we want to maintain today 's outstanding level of aviation safety without placing an undue regulatory burden on an emerging industry			0
' he said the agency intends to issue final rules as quickly as it can			1
among the proposals being laid out are requirements that commercial operators will need to meet in order to be allowed to fly small drones weighing less than 55 pounds			2
it means that operators will have to pass a knowledge test administered by the @entity10 and a security check by the @entity60			1
the measures being unveiled by the @entity10 are still in the works and it could be two or three years before the rules are made final			1
@entity65 , president and ceo of the @entity67 , a trade group said : ' the proposed rules are ' a good first step ' bringing the @entity5 closer to realizing the benefits of drone technology ' no fly zone : legally , drones ca n’t be flown over restricted airspace including national parks , military bases and within a five mile ( 8km ) radius of medium and large airports			1
data analysts recently created a map of the @entity5 that plots where owners can pilot their drones , and where specifically the drones are banned ( pictured ) however as drones are introduced , some will worry about their ability to impact their privacy , particularly over homes and offices			2
to allay these fears , @entity92 , a pilot from @entity93 teamed up with drone makers to create a global database called @entity97 that lets anyone set up no - fly zones above their homes			0
it works by users using a website to enter their location , name and an email address to verify the request			0
this address is converted into a latitude and longitude point , as well as a series of points that accurately marks out the edges of a property			0
legally , drones ca n’t be flown over restricted airspace including national parks , military bases and within a five mile ( 8km ) radius of medium and large airports			2
yet federal officials said that once commercial drones are in place the economic and safety benefits of unmanned aircraft are expected to be enormous			0
even with the restrictions , drones are expected to play a ' transformative role in fields as diverse as urban infrastructure management , farming , public safety , coastal security , military training , search and rescue , and disaster response , ' the @entity127 said			2
however , there will be measures that federal agencies must follow to guard against abuse of data collected in drone flights			0
among other steps , the order requires agencies to review privacy and civil rights protections before deploying drone technology and to adhere to a range of controls			0
personally identifiable information collected in drone flights is to be kept no longer than 180 days , although there are exceptions			0
it 's questionable whether such steps will satisfy civil liberties advocates , who 've objected strongly to the government 's vigorous use of digital surveillance in the name of national security			0
the proposal also raises the possibility that final rules may include a separate category for very small drones — those weighing 4.4 pounds or less — that would include fewer restrictions .			1

drones could be used for routine tasks including aerial photography
but there will be restrictions on night time use and its general operation
@entity10 said it could be two to three years before rules on drones become final
