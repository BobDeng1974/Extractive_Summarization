@entity0 scored twice and @entity1 scratched a nine - year itch against @entity3 as the @entity5 pace - setters were beaten 2 - 0 at @entity6			1
prior to today @entity7 had failed to defeat the @entity8 since september 2005 , some 12 games ago in their rivalry			0
that @entity3 won 10 of that dozen made it an all the more frustrating record for the @entity13			1
one win in 10 against anyone before this hardly inspired confidence either but @entity0 's double powered @entity1 on as @entity18 's men were rattled in a way they rarely have been this season			1
@entity0 ( right ) scores his first of two goals for @entity1 as they won 2 - 0 against @entity3 @entity3 goalkeeper @entity23 ( centre ) was unable to keep the shot out @entity1 players celebrate after @entity0 put them ahead with a goal on 43 minutes @entity1 : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 68 ) , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 95 ) , @entity0 , @entity39			1

goals : @entity47 43 , 50 @entity3 : @entity23 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 66 ) , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 66 ) , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 66 )			1
subs not used : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65			0
referee : @entity59 att : 26,028 @entity3 looked the better bet in the opening quarter but , once @entity1 started to dominate in midfield , the home side took control			1
that had not appeared likely early on as @entity18 's men - with six wins in seven on the road - settled the quicker of the sides			0
for all that , though , their best early offerings were a shot wide from @entity52 and a couple of half - openings for @entity58 in the wake of defensive lapses			1
@entity30 also had to be pinpoint with a last - ditch tackle on a clean - through @entity84 , before the hosts started to impose themselves			2
in a fiery opening 30 minutes they had three men booked but , once they started tackling cleanly and keeping the ball , they looked markedly better			0
it was soon @entity3 's players swinging and missing , two of their men having their names taken , with @entity53 one of those booked as he tried in vain to take down @entity36 who forced @entity23 into a smart save			2
with @entity36 and @entity35 first to the ball , more @entity1 chances came and 43 minutes in they scored			2
will @entity55 lost out to @entity36 , his ball found @entity39 and his pass from the left of the box was tucked in by @entity0			0
the same man was on the spot six minutes after the break too , adding a second			0
captain @entity32 got down the left , pulled the ball back and @entity0 showed terrific composure to beat @entity23			0
@entity0 ( right ) applauds supporters at the end of the match as @entity1 recorded a surprise win @entity3 manager @entity18 looks on as his side were defeated by @entity1 on saturday @entity55 of @entity3 ( right ) controls the ball as @entity1 midfielder @entity36 ( left ) closes him down @entity29 went in pursuit of a third and was denied by @entity23 after a mazy run on the right , while @entity3 felt they had a penalty shout on the hour mark			1
@entity31 - already booked - brought down @entity122 on the very edge of the box			0
referee @entity59 validated the decision with his assistant , stuck to his original call and the free - kick was cleared as @entity3 protested			2
@entity18 made a triple change to try to pep up his men but @entity1 continued to press , @entity0 denied a hat - trick as @entity23 got down well to shove away a low drive			1
@entity3 should have made a fist of it with 10 minutes to go , @entity60 wildly off target from 10 yards after a brilliant @entity32 clearance off the line , and with that their chances went .			0

@entity1 record first *victory* over @entity3 since 2005 with 2 - 0 win
@entity3 started stronger before the @entity1 midfield took over the game
*striker* @entity0 scored two goals either side of half - time
