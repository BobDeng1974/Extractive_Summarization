by @entity0 visitors to @entity2 from ' high risk ' countries will have to put up a £ 3,000 bond under plans introduced by home secretary @entity7 tens of thousands of visitors from @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 will be forced to pay a £ 3,000 bond to be allowed to enter @entity2			1
they will only get the money back once they leave the country in a bid to end abuse of the visa system			1
home secretary @entity7 said the intention was to make the immigration system more ‘ selective ’ and deter people from ‘ overstaying ’ once their visitor visa has expired			1
in the long - term , she hopes to extend the @entity28 - style bond scheme to also include foreign workers and students			2
the idea will be welcomed by backbench @entity32 , who have been urging the government to take a tougher line on immigration to combat the threat of @entity38			0
but it is likely to face legal challenges on the grounds that – because it targets only people from so - called ‘ high risk ’ countries – it is discriminatory			0
there are also fears it may lead to countries such as @entity10 making @entity2 tourists pay a similar bond			1
the scheme will be piloted from november , for people from @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity54 , @entity13 and @entity55			1
they are being targeted because of the high volume of visitor visa applications and relatively high levels of abuse			1
mrs may said : ‘ in the long run we ’re interested in a system of bonds that deters overstaying and recovers costs if a foreign national has used our public services			0
’ the £ 3,000 bonds are part of mrs may 's plans to bring annual net migration to under 100,000 by 2015 immigration bonds have been repeatedly considered by ministers over the years , but have never been successfully introduced			2
@entity75 abandoned its own plans for a £ 1,000 bond in 2008 amid an outcry from migrant rights groups			2
they claim the policy is discriminatory as it does not apply to people from countries such as @entity28 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
@entity86 , chairman of the @entity87 , said the idea was ‘ unworkable ’ and ‘ impractical ’			0
mr @entity86 , an ex-foreign office minister , claimed it would not deter people from trying to stay on after their visas ended , and said the targeted countries would be ‘ likely to retaliate ’			1
the policy has the backing of @entity96 leader @entity95			0
he suggested the introduction of bonds in march , though was proposing the level should be fixed at £ 1,000			0
the move will require a change in the immigration rules but not a vote by @entity32 .			0

plans by home secretary mean visitors lose their cash if they overstay visa
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity13 , @entity55 , @entity54 and @entity12 to be targeted
pilot scheme will later be extended to cover work permits and student visas
