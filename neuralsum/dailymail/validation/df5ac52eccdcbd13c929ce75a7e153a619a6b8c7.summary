an anorexic teenager whose weight dropped to just five stone is fighting back from the condition by setting up a catering business			1
@entity5 , 18 from @entity6 , @entity7 , was surviving on nothing other than coffee when she dropped to her lowest weight in march of last year			1
after several ill - fated attempts to fight the illness , @entity5 collapsed in her bathroom where she was found by her boyfriend - and her family told her they feared for her life if she did n't get help			1
@entity5 said : ' this business has helped me get out of a massive hole			1
if i 'm honest , it was a hole i never thought i would get out of			0
it just seemed like a never - ending cycle of problems			2
' @entity5 says she has had problems with her stomach which have baffled doctors for most of her life , but at 14 she was finally told her colon had collapsed and had surgery to insert a stent into her stomach			1
that returned her to some sort of normality , but in march last year her eating problems began to worsen and those around her began to notice			0
@entity5 said : ' my boyfriend , mum and dad noticed i had stopped eating again , i was just surviving on coffee , ' she said			1
' i was doing a cookery course at the time as well as working part time at a pub so i was surrounded by food but i just could n't bring myself to eat anything			0
@entity5 looks happy as she poses with some of her cooking equipment and her freshly baked goods @entity5 looks happy as she poses in her chefs outfit complete with an apron with the name of her company on the front ' my boss told me to take some time out because it was clear i was n't 100 per cent so i went to the doctors and that is when i was told i had anorexia			1
' i knew i always had problems with food but to actually be diagnosed as anorexic just played havoc with my mind			0
@entity5 continued : ' i tried to combat it in so many ways that i look back on now and think ' what was i doing ? ' such as just staying in bed , working out at the gym all the time and just generally not accepting help			2
then , a terrifying episode later that year made it hit home just how bad her problem was			0
@entity5 said : ' after one long day working from 11am until 10pm at the pub in which i had n't eaten , my boyfriend found me collapsed on the bathroom floor			1
@entity5 's weight plummeted to just five stone but she is not much healthier ( right ) @entity5 poses with her boyfriend @entity100 who raised the alarm after he discovered her collapsed on the bathroom floor ' i ca n't remember much about what happened but he said i could n't go back there as i was just too unwell			1
' we went on holiday and my family told me they thought i would die if i carried on working in that environment			0
' it hit me then			0
i realised something needed to be done to save my life			0
@entity5 quit her job and spent time at home recuperating , which got her thinking about ways to get herself better			2
' i always wanted my own business so @entity121 told me to maybe do some work for myself while i get better , ' she said			0
' i had been at cooking college and it was something i wanted to do for a living , so i started doing cakes and getting people ordering from me and it 's just grown from there			2
' @entity131 sought treatment for her anorexia at the @entity26 in @entity27 @entity5 says that having her new business has helped her to start eating again after suffering for years with anorexia @entity138 has been helping out and @entity5 said that , while there is still a long way to go for both her condition and her business , she is optimistic for the future			1
' i still have to have check - ups twice a week but i 'm weighing just over eight stone now which is a lot healthier than i was , ' she said			2
' my parents have been so supportive by letting me run the business from home and my boyfriend has been a tower of strength as well			0
' the business started small but it has just kept growing and growing			0
of course i still have bad days when i barely eat anything but as a result of starting the business i 'm now eating a lot more and worrying a lot less			0
' @entity5 's @entity138 ( right ) has been helping @entity5 with her new business whisk of @entity5			1
