out : @entity1 's ceo @entity0 has said he will retire from the fast food giant on march 1 @entity1 's ceo @entity0 is stepping down from the world 's biggest hamburger chain as it fights to hold onto customers and transform its image			1
@entity0 is one of a handful of black @entity10 and has worked at @entity11 for nearly 25 years			1
the company said @entity0 , 51 , who has been ceo for two - and - a - half years , will be replaced by 47 - year - old chief brand officer @entity13 on march 1			1
previously , @entity13 served as president of @entity1 's @entity15 and led efforts related to marketing and menus			1
shares in the world 's biggest fast - food chain , which have been underperforming major markets and several peers , jumped 3.2 percent in extended trading following the news			2
@entity11 , which has more than 35,000 locations around the world , has been struggling amid intensifying competition and changing attitudes to food			2
earlier this month , the company reported falling earnings and sales and said it was making major changes this year to bring back customers and save money			0
it said it would slow down new restaurant openings in some markets			0
it 's also making menu changes			2
among the challenges @entity42 - born @entity13 will inherit as the chief executive are : the image that fast - food is junk food ; the growing number of convenience stores selling cheap , ready - to - eat food and the surging popularity of companies selling higher - quality food , such as @entity54			1
mixed tenure in charge : @entity0 , president and chief executive officer of @entity11 , talks with staff at @entity1 's headquarters in @entity60 , @entity61 @entity1 's says it 's already working to address some of those issues , including launching a campaign designed to dispel common myths about its food			1
@entity0 , the 51 - year - old former president of @entity1 's @entity68 who took the global helm in july 2012 , came in at a time when the company had racked up nearly nine years of sales gains at its established restaurants			1
but the following september , @entity11 's reported a decline in same - store sales as it fought to hold on to customers with changing tastes and amid external pressures ranging political and economic turmoil in @entity15 to food safety scares in @entity81			2
' i do n't think it was too much of a surprise			0
maybe in the timing but not the action , ' @entity86 analyst @entity85 said			0
' this has been something that people have been talking about for a while			0
' in his role as chief brand officer , @entity13 led @entity1 's digital initiatives and efforts to boost menu innovation , according to a statement from the company			1
industry watchers also said his track record includes turning around the company 's business in the @entity42			2
new @entity42 ceo : @entity0 , who has been ceo for two - and - a - half years , will be replaced by @entity13 ( pictured ) , a company veteran who rejoined @entity1 's as its chief brand officer in 2013 - after previously working for the firm in the @entity42 here 's a look at the challenges @entity13 , 47 , will inherit as @entity11 's new ceo , and the changes that are already under way			1
@entity113 is junk food @entity1 's is trying to shake perceptions that fast - food is cheap , greasy and made with mysterious ingredients			1
to dispel myths about its food , the company recently launched a campaign inviting people to ask frank , sometimes squeamish questions about its menu offerings , such as ' does @entity1 's beef contain worms ? ' and ' @entity1 's buns contain the same chemicals used to make yoga mats ? ' part of the problem for @entity1 's and other traditional fast - food chains is that people are gravitating toward food they feel is more wholesome or made with higher quality ingredients			1
and newer places like @entity54 and @entity137 are positioning their food as just that			2
presidential seal of approval : despite his hygiene faux - pas at the counter , @entity141 is a known fan of @entity54 and their easy to understand , healthier , custom options @entity145 , president of @entity1 's @entity68 , said last month that the company is looking at shrinking the number of ingredients it uses and employing different cooking procedures to enhance the appeal of its food			1
' why do we need to have preservatives in our food ? ' @entity145 asked			0
' we probably do n't			0
' @entity156 , @entity157 @entity1 's has conceded its menu in the @entity68 has gotten bloated			1
in just the past decade , the company has said it added 100 items to its menu			0
that slows down service because it takes customers longer to figure out what they want , while also complicating kitchen operations			0
it also increases the chances that orders will be wrong			0
as such , @entity1 's has said it 's looking at a simplified menu that reduces the number of @entity173 , and trims items that may be repetitive , such as variations of the @entity176 with different toppings			1
@entity178 the ability to customize orders is gaining popularity			0
at @entity54 , for instance , people like that they can walk down a line and dictate exactly what goes into their bowls and burritos			0
in hopes of giving customers more flexibility in adjusting their burgers , @entity1 's rolled out new prep tables that can hold more condiments and toppings			1
it also has more dramatic plans in the works			0
same old : a customer walks away from a counter at @entity11 in @entity202			0
the layout and menu of the fast food giant has been criticized for being inflexible , boring and out of date @entity1 's says it will roll out an option that lets people build their own burgers at 2,000 of its more than 14,000 @entity68 locations later this year			1
the food takes a bit longer to prepare , but the company is hoping customers will think it 's worth the wait			2
prices too high a major attraction of @entity1 's is that the food is supposed to be affordable			1
but prices have gotten a bit high for some people			0
the popular @entity173 is one reason for the skewed prices			0
to offset the deals on that menu , @entity1 's has admitted that other parts of the menu got too expensive			1
in turn , the company has said that prompted people to ' trade down ' to the @entity173			0
and that left many customers associating the @entity11 's brand with its cheapest items			0
affordable food is also more widely available elsewhere , with convenience stores and supermarkets expanding their prepared food and coffee offerings			0
according to a 2008 story in the @entity244 , that business was stalling in the early 2000s , but it had a strong run under @entity13 , who took over as ceo in 2006 and refocused on the core business of selling hamburgers			2
' the @entity42 has been a good market for them for a long time , but it was n't always , ' @entity85 said			0
' he played a role in the turnaround			0
' the question is can he turn around the company 's brand , particularly in the @entity68 where it is losing share to rivals such as @entity262 , @entity54 and other smaller , regional food outlets which are seen as offering fresher and higher quality products			2
@entity13 has experience leading other restaurant chains			2
in 2011 , he left @entity1 's and ran two @entity42 - based restaurant chains , @entity267 , a @entity42 chain which markets itself on quality and freshness , and later , @entity271 , a pan-asian restaurant chain modeled on @entity274 ramen bars			1
he returned to @entity1 's in 2013			1
@entity275 , a portfolio manager at @entity276 , which owns roughly a million shares of @entity11 , said @entity13 is a logical choice for the job			2
' i think that it 's very fitting that they 've selected the chief brand officer , ' he said			0
' this is really where we 're seeing a little bit of a vacancy in @entity1 's			1
they 're trying to really find their brand to be able to drive same store sales growth			0
' @entity1 's warned last week that business would be weak in the first half of 2015 and said it would cut its annual construction budget to the lowest in more than five years as it opens fewer restaurants in struggling markets .			1

@entity0 , 51 , will retire from @entity1 's on march 1 after 25 years
one of a handful of black @entity10 he has been in the role for less than three years
successor @entity13 , 47 , grew up in @entity304 and studied at @entity305
he has been with fast food giant for 20 years and lives in @entity61
