over the course of two games against @entity3 from the @entity4 , @entity0 have seemingly invented new methods of not scoring			1
with just minutes of this replay left , however , @entity7 ’ team finally found a way and @entity11 ’s dream of a birthday @entity14 final lives on			1
@entity0 should have won the first game a week - and - half ago			1
certainly they should have won this one much more easily than this			0
however , having hit the frame of the goal three times , they were staring at an embarrassing defeat after @entity23 ’s second half penalty edged @entity3 to the precipice of another 2015 @entity14 shock			1
@entity27 's 90th minute strike gave @entity0 a 2 - 1 lead against @entity3 on wednesday night the @entity30 midfielder points to the sky after his goal put @entity0 into the @entity14 fifth round the 22 - year - old prepares to curl a delightful effort off the underside of the bar and into the @entity3 net @entity3 3 - 5 - 2 : @entity39 7 , @entity40 7 , @entity41 7 , @entity42 7 , @entity43 6.5 , @entity44 7.5 , @entity45 5 , @entity46 7 , @entity47 7 ( @entity48 ' ) , @entity23 7 , @entity49 6 subs not used : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 booked : @entity45 , @entity41 sent off : @entity45 goals : @entity23 59 ' ( p ) @entity0 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : @entity59 6 : can 8 , @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 7 : @entity62 5.5 ( @entity63 62mins 5 ) , @entity64 6 , @entity11 6.5 , @entity65 7 : @entity27 8.5 , @entity66 7.5 , @entity67 5.5 ( @entity68 55mins 7 ) subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 booked : @entity64 goals : @entity75 ' , @entity27 90 ' ref : @entity76 player ratings by @entity78 at the @entity79 with a man advantage after the subsequent sending off of @entity3 ’s @entity45 , @entity0 still looked as though they were heading out			1
with five minutes to go , however , @entity0 ’s pressure – and their extra player – finally told			1
first defender @entity85 – really a central midfield player – delivered a lovely chip over the @entity3 defence for @entity66 to volley in the equaliser			1
then , three minutes later and with extra time seemingly inevitable , @entity89 beat @entity3 goalkeeper @entity39 with a right foot shot from 20 yards to hand @entity0 a fifth round game at @entity93			1
it was tough on @entity95 ’s @entity3			2
struggling with injuries , the home team played for 90 minutes with a defender – @entity99 – up front			0
had they not had @entity45 sent off , they may won			2
at 1 - 0 @entity23 spurned a really good headed chance and that also proved significant			1
@entity0 , though , somehow found a way to win			2
it ’s a habit they must now keep			0
@entity7 spoke in the run - up to the game about the manner in which his team had improved in recent weeks			1
it was easy to see his point but it is not an observation that extends to @entity0 ’s work in front of goal			2
they do have mitigating circumstances – their centre forwards are either not good enough or rarely fit enough – but they are in danger of becoming a little like the @entity123 side of a few seasons ago			0
lovely to watch but inadequate at the art of scoring			0
@entity7 spoke of justice being served after the final whistle			1
' it was never a penalty , ' he said			0
his defender @entity60 did dangle a leg in front of young @entity3 prospect @entity47 in the 59th minute , though , and had @entity0 gone on to lose @entity7 may well have found that he had few allies when it came to talk of miscarriages of justice			1
simply , @entity0 need to start taking a greater share of the chances they create			2
wednesday night began with @entity11 shooting tamely at @entity39 when he perhaps should have scored and that pretty much set the tone for the evening			0
@entity65 ( left ) jumps for joy with @entity27 as @entity0 secure an @entity14 fifth round tie against @entity142 @entity3 striker @entity23 celebrates scoring his second half penalty in front of the home crowd against @entity0 @entity0 defender @entity60 fouls 19 - year - old @entity47 inside the @entity3 box to hand the home side a penalty @entity47 , making just his third @entity3 start , is tripped by @entity60 as referee @entity76 looks on in the distance @entity23 ( left ) puts @entity3 into a 1 - 0 lead against @entity0 with a penalty in the 59th minute saturday february 14 @entity153 v @entity154 blackburn v @entity155 derby v @entity156 @entity93 v @entity0 sunday february 15 @entity158 v @entity157 @entity160 v @entity159 @entity123 v @entity161 monday february 16 @entity163 v @entity162 @entity3 were always in the game			1
they were significantly second best in terms of possession and chances , though , and @entity0 should have been ahead by half - time			1
in the wake of @entity11 ’s early opportunity , there were similar sights of goal for @entity66 , @entity27 and the disappointing @entity67			1
sometimes @entity39 saved while on occasion the wrong choice was made			0
there was over-elaboration , too , and some bad luck when @entity66 curled a cute effort against the angle of post and bar from 12 yards			2
in games like this , one of two things usually happens			0
either the dam breaks and the water pours in or something goes awry at the other end			0
on this occasion it was the latter			0
@entity0 spurned further chances early in the second half as @entity66 over hit a simple pass to @entity67 and then saw a curling shot touched over by the @entity3 goalkeeper			1
he was also played clear on goal only for @entity40 to tackle him			0
@entity3 ’s penalty emerged out of nothing			1
a cute dart in to the box by @entity47 was all it took to tempt @entity60 and @entity23 rolled the kick down the centre of the goal			1
as @entity95 pointed out afterwards , his team were not immediately besieged			0
@entity0 seemed shocked to be behind and left the goal scorer unmarked at the far post soon after			2
the header was straight at @entity59			0
' that would have sealed the game , ' said @entity95 and he may have been right			0
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity59 dives to his right as @entity23 calmly stroke @entity3 into the lead the 36 - year - old striker smiles as he celebrates putting the home side ahead from the penalty spot the @entity0 players react after @entity23 's penalty put @entity220 's side behind @entity45 ( left ) was shown a second yellow card for this challenge on @entity0 midfielder @entity64 @entity66 ( left ) pulls @entity0 level with his five minutes to go after a brilliant team move @entity226 's winning goal came after the @entity0 attack worked the @entity3 backline from right to left in the closing stages sterling wheels away in celebration of his 86th minute equaliser against @entity95 's side @entity0 's best chance of the first 45 minutes came when @entity66 hit the @entity3 post with a curling effort the @entity240 international looks dejected after seeing his striker hit the post as the score remained 0 - 0 @entity60 gets to grips with @entity3 's veteran striker @entity23 as the former @entity247 man controls the ball subsequently the sending - off did n’t help the home side			1
@entity45 had already been booked for a first half lunge at @entity64 and when he did it again he had to go			1
it was this that finally gave @entity0 some fresh impetus and belief at a time when they looked as though they may be running short on both			2
the introduction of @entity68 and @entity260 helped also , the latter finally giving @entity0 ’s attacking movements some genuine shape			2
still @entity0 could n’t score , though			0
@entity66 drove a shot goal wards only for it to rebound off a defender ’s legs before @entity41 ’s head diverted a @entity68 shot on to a post and @entity39 ’s fingertips touched a super can shot on to the bar			0
with the clock ticking , @entity7 had pushed can forwards into midfield , his natural position			0
it proved a significant decision as the @entity280 ’s chipped pass to @entity66 was as precise as the subsequent finish			0
it may yet prove to be one of the most telling goals of @entity0 ’s year			2
as for the winner , it had a rather peculiar trajectory			0
so , though , has @entity0 ’s season			0
it does , however , remain alive			0
@entity46 ( right ) skips past the challenge of @entity62 during an impressive first half from the home side @entity3 goalkeeper @entity39 makes a brilliant save to keep out a first half strike from @entity66 @entity3 defender @entity99 ( left ) challenges @entity0 's @entity60 during a goalless first half at the @entity79 @entity295 leaps over @entity39 as the @entity3 stopper slides out to claim the ball @entity11 was wearing a pair of boots with ' 700 ' stitched into them to mark his 700th appearances for the @entity301 @entity95 gestures to his @entity3 players during the @entity14 fourth round replay against @entity0			1

@entity305 gives @entity3 1 - 0 lead with second half penalty
19 - year - old @entity47 fouled by @entity0 's @entity60 to earn spot - kick
@entity66 levels the scoring for @entity7 side inside last 10 minutes
@entity27 bags late winner to send @entity301 into @entity14 fifth round
@entity3 forced to play final 20 minutes with 10 men after @entity45 is shown a second yellow card
@entity0 will play @entity93 in the @entity14 fifth round
