@entity1 chairman @entity0 has suggested that @entity2 is on a three - month audition to prove he has the credentials to manage the club on a long - term basis			1
the former youth coach was appointed @entity9 's boss until the end of the season earlier this week following the resignation of @entity13			1
@entity2 was put in caretaker charge as @entity0 began the search for a new permanent manager with former @entity18 head coach @entity17 and @entity19 heavily linked with the post			1
@entity2 has been given the @entity1 manager 's job until the end of the season @entity2 and first team coach @entity25 watched on as @entity1 claimed a 2 - 0 win against @entity28 @entity2 has the chance to earn the job on a more permanent basis , says @entity0 @entity32 ( a ) @entity33 ( @entity34 ) @entity18 ( @entity34 ) @entity35 ( a ) @entity36 ( @entity34 ) @entity37 ( a ) @entity38 ( @entity34 ) @entity39 ( a ) @entity40 ( @entity34 ) @entity41 ( a ) @entity42 ( a ) @entity43 ( @entity34 ) @entity44 ( a ) but after impressing the chairman during his short spell in charge , including earning the west @entity50 club 's first away points of the season with the midweek win against @entity28 , @entity0 has decided to place his faith in the rookie for the remainder of the campaign			1
the daunting task facing the 52 - year - old is to steer @entity1 to @entity60 safety and @entity0 says that @entity2 has an opportunity to secure the job on a more permanent basis			1
' there are no guarantees in football			0
but @entity2 has every chance to build a long term and huge managerial future at @entity1			1
we are lucky , ' @entity0 tweeted on saturday morning			2
@entity71 scored @entity1 's second goal as they beat @entity28 to claim their first away win of the season @entity71 celebrates with his team - mates as @entity2 won his first game as caretaker manager ' we found a great guy to manage us from next season , a dream manager , but actually we had a dream candidate right in front of us @entity2			1
' ' so we the board decided to give @entity2 a chance and he certainly has been a dream in such a short period			1
' he almost works 24hrs			0
after first team he takes eds and even under 14			0
he 's modest , gets on with the job is organised , passionate and loyal			2
' @entity1 chairman @entity0 will appoint @entity2 as @entity93 boss until the end of the season			1
here @entity96 look at five key issues he needs to address to ensure they beat the drop			0
@entity100 despite picking up their first win on the road against @entity28 last time out , the previous 11 matches did not yield a single point for @entity93			0
with @entity33 , @entity18 and @entity38 still to come to @entity108 , their away form could be the key to ensuring their @entity60 survival			0
@entity111 rangers have the joint worst defensive record in the league and , with goals also at a premium , tightening up at the back is a must			0
@entity13 failed to identify his preferred central defensive partnership so finding a system that gets the best out of @entity122 and @entity123 could make the difference			2
share the goals @entity126 has contributed 50 per cent of @entity1 's goals in the @entity60 and that form has rightly led to talk of a potential @entity131 call - up			2
but @entity2 will be looking for someone else to help shoulder the scoring burden , especially with the former @entity135 man not having scored in open play since the december win over @entity37			2
@entity138 @entity139 down this may be easier said than done , with the combative midfielder becoming the first player in @entity60 history to be cautioned in seven consecutive matches			0
@entity146 's leadership qualities and never - say - die attitude are far more beneficial on the field than off it , so avoiding suspensions is crucial			0
integrate a squad of egos @entity146 , @entity153 , @entity122			0
none of the three are afraid to speak their minds and they are not the only squad members with chequered pasts			0
@entity159 and @entity160 have also had high - profile disagreements with managers and @entity2 will need to forge a team ethos to stand any chance of survival .			1

@entity2 was appointed @entity1 boss until at least the end of the season
@entity13 quit the club this month *due* to *persistent* knee problem
