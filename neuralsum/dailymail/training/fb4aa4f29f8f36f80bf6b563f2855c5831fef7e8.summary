an alien signal has been picked up by astronomers			1
the source of the flash of radio waves is unknown , leading to speculation that it came from a giant celestial flare , an imploding star – or maybe from an alien civilisation			1
the mystery signal originated up to 5.5billion light years away , far beyond the @entity10			1
alien ? the mystery signal originated up to 5.5billion light years away , far beyond the @entity10 ( file picture ) it lasted just a fraction of a second – yet may have given off as much energy in that time as the @entity17 does in an entire day			1
a handful of these ‘ fast radio bursts ’ have been discovered before by sifting the through old data			2
now , scientists using a giant radio telescope in @entity23 have captured one tearing through space in real time			1
@entity26 , of the @entity27 , in @entity28 , @entity29 , said : ‘ these events are one of the biggest mysteries in the @entity33			2
until now , astronomers were not able to catch one of these events in the act			0
’ development : @entity26 , of the @entity27 ( above ) , in @entity28 , @entity29 , said the ' fast radio burst ' events are one of the ' biggest mysteries in the @entity33 ' researcher @entity42 said : ‘ for the project we had the telescope pointed at the location where one of the previous bursts from the data sets was recorded			0
‘ it ’s so exciting to know a similar occurrence has happened in the proximity of the first			0
' fast radio bursts only last as long as it takes a human to blink their eye			0
that is what makes this discovery so exciting			0
’ possible explanations for the phenomenon include giant flares from distant stars or imploding neutron stars – small , particularly dense stars			1
some may even speculate that the signal has been beamed out by an aliens in another world			2
whatever the source , identifying it is only a matter of time , the @entity71 ’s @entity70 says			2
miss @entity42 , who made the find while studying for her phd , said : ‘ we ’ve set the trap			0
now we just have to wait for another burst to fall into it			0

@entity83 could have also come from giant celestial flare or imploding star
signal originated far beyond @entity10 but lasted a fraction of a second
it may have given off as much energy in that time as @entity17 does in a day
