' then 12 seconds before half - time , he got his hamstring injury and , okay , you know if it is really a hamstring injury then he will be out for four or five weeks			1
' i do n't regret playing him			2
he had some calf problems out of the game against @entity13 , but he trained yesterday			0

' @entity31 has a little bit the same as he had when he came back from the @entity62 national team			1
