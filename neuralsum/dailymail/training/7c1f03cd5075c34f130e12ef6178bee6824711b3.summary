by @entity0 for @entity1 as well as proving that we will wear pretty much anything in the name of fashion - including what can only described as an adult baby - gro - the onesie kickstarted a trend for ironic , playful fashion			2
celebrities such as @entity13 and @entity14 could n't get enough of them and fuelled huge demand from the public			0
however , according to the high street , the comic all - in - one has had its day			0
step away from the onesie : celebrities such as @entity22 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) helped fuel the trend stores like @entity25 are set to offer a wide range of @entity28 knitwear this season to supply the growing demand yes , it 's time to shrug off that one - piece , this year is all about the continuing comeback of novelty knitwear - the weirder and wackier the better			1
from outlandish frosty the snowman designs to a @entity37 with a battery - powered flashing nose , it 's no longer unusual to see grown men and women walking around in eye - catching festive fare , spurred on in part by charity drives such as sponsored ‘ @entity44 at work ’ days			0
and the trend looks set to continue to rise , with @entity47 ’s , who sold a @entity28 jumper every 22 seconds last year ordering five times more stock this year in preparation			1
speaking to @entity1 @entity52 , head of design @entity54 comments : ' @entity28 jumpers sold out last year as soon as they hit stores and with the fantastic breath of offer for this festive season no doubt they will be best sellers			0
' model @entity13 was a well known onesie lover , favouring the more outlandish designs worn by the likes of @entity66 , the onesie looks to be usurped from the top spot by novelty knitwear but if you thought that however garish a knitted hat or jumper , it ca n't be as bad as elephant , tiger and bunny onesies , think again			1
novelty twosies - or matching top and bottom tracksuits - are also predicted to be a hit			1
speaking to the @entity80 , @entity81 of @entity47 's says : ' we do n't really see a growth this year in onesies			1
it will more about the two - piece and outfits that match head - to - toe			0
' creating the same effect as the onesie but with the added advantage of making it a bit easier to go to the toilet , it seems we may soon see entire families kitted out in matching knitwear			0
speaking to the @entity80 , a spokesperson from @entity98 , who have increased their ordering of festive knits by 62 per cent from last year says : ' we are going after the whole family : mum , dad , the kids and the dog			2
