@entity0 says parents will have more control children will be protected by a block on online pornography which parents will have to choose to have lifted , @entity0 vows today			1
after weeks of confusion over the government ’s plans to protect youngsters , the prime minister makes clear that under the proposals , web filters will be ‘ default on ’ for houses with children			1
in an article for the @entity18 , the prime minister says it is ‘ utterly appalling ’ that so many children have been exposed to the ‘ darkest corners ’ of the internet , adding : ‘ a silent attack on innocence is under way in our country today and i am determined that we fight it with all we ’ve got			1
’ he announces that @entity29 mp @entity29 , who has led the campaign for a broader , automatic block on adult material for all internet users , is to be appointed as his adviser on reversing the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood			1
she will be in charge of implementing the new web filter system , which will also require internet providers to check the age of the person setting controls			1
mr @entity0 ’s intervention follows a concerted campaign for an automatic block by this newspaper and will be welcomed by campaigners on child internet safety , although concerns remain about how the government plans to address children accessing porn via their own smartphones , and phones and tablets such as @entity57 using public wi - fi			1
ministers were criticised last week when they appeared to have rejected calls for an automatic block on adult material for all households			2
critics said ministers had put the profits of internet giants ahead of the safety of children by vetoing an ‘ opt - in ’ system , under which adults could only see adult images if they specifically asked to do so			1
there will be internet options to block particular kinds of content , individual sites or restrict access at specific times of the day ( posed by model ) mr @entity0 , however , insists it is clear that a ‘ more sophisticated system ’ will be more effective – arguing that straightforward ‘ on / off ’ filters are so wide - ranging that parents often switch them off in frustration when they block innocent sites			1
the prime minister says the @entity89 , which has advised the government on how to shield children from adult and violent internet content , is backing alternative proposals to allow parents to tailor exactly what they can and can not see			1
mp @entity29 led the campaign for a broader , automatic block ministers are understood to have imposed a timetable on internet providers , who will be required to raise their game and produce detailed plans by february on ensuring that all parents are giving the option of imposing filters			1
mr @entity0 says that when people switch on a new computer , they will be asked if there are children in the house – and if they answer yes , they will be automatically prompted to tailor internet filters			1
they will include options to block particular kinds of content , individual sites or restrict access at specific times of the day			2
if parents click through the options to set up a new system quickly , filters against pornography and self - harm sites will be automatically left on			2
‘ so this is a kind of “ default on ” for houses with children ; it ’s just that it adds much more control for parents about exactly what is restricted , ’ the prime minister writes			1
mrs @entity29 , mp for @entity132 and a parliamentary aide at the @entity134 , said she welcomed the prime minister ’s plans			1
‘ clearly , like many others i thought an opt - in was the simplest and best way to do it , ’ she said			2
‘ but you have to listen when you do consultations			0
it is clear people think that more needs to be done , but there is n’t a majority in favour of an automatic block			0
if you have proper age verification systems , then i think this new system will put us a long way ahead of the rest of the world			0
‘ as near as damn it , we have got what we want and most campaigners are quite happy			0
the industry has , with a few notable exceptions , been quite slow but there is now good momentum			0
it will be my job to make sure it all gets implemented			0
’ mrs @entity29 said effective checks on the age of a person setting up filters – probably using credit card details and the electoral roll – would be vital to ensure children could not get round the new system			1
access to adult content via smartphones remained a concern , but she said all parents signing a mobile contract should be offered the chance to set up a filter			0
@entity178 of the @entity179 said the charity still believed an ‘ opt in ’ system was the best way to protect children , but called the prime minister ’s proposals ‘ a big step in the right direction ’			1
a survey by the charity @entity189 of 851 youngsters – most aged between 11 and 15 – revealed that two in five young people have seen or read something online that upset them			0
some 56 per cent of youngsters said they believed all illegal or inappropriate material should be filtered out as standard			0
recently there has been a lot of debate about how we protect our children from damaging influences online : pornography , suicide websites , violent videos and so on			1
let me be clear right from the start : i am a father of three young children and i take this issue extremely seriously			1
to me , the fact that so many children have visited the darkest corners of the internet is not just a matter of concern – it is utterly appalling			1
a silent attack on innocence is underway in our country today and i am determined that we fight it with all we ’ve got			0
some might ask why , then , this government has not taken the route of ‘ default on ’ filters for new computers , so that each one that is bought comes with blanket filters for all unsuitable @entity228 ’s a simple reason why we have n’t done this : all the evidence suggests such a crude system would n’t work very well in practice			0
with the system , when people switch on their new computer , a question will pop up asking if there are children in the house			1
if there are , then parents will be automatically prompted to tailor their internet filters ( posed by model ) take the experience of one parent i met			1
she has a tablet computer which her young daughter sometimes plays games on			0
it ’s got straightforward ‘ on / off ’ filters , so she turned the filter ‘ on ’ to protect her daughter			0
however , the filters were so wide - ranging that she then found she could n’t access things like tv stations on demand ; they were blocked too			0
the result ? she just switched the filter off again , as it was becoming annoying			0
the point is we need a more sophisticated system than this – one that allows parents to tailor exactly what their children can see			2
this is what child safety experts recommend			0
it ’s what @entity277 , the head of the @entity89 , recommends			0
so that ’s exactly what we ’re bringing in			0
with our system , when people switch on their new computer , a question will pop up asking if there are children in the house			2
if there are , then parents will be automatically prompted to tailor their internet filters			2
want to restrict access to @entity292 after 8pm ? decide to allow younger children to view fewer sites than their older siblings ? or want to stop access to certain sites altogether ? now you will be shown how to do it			2
to make this doubly safe , if parents just repeatedly click ‘ ok ’ to get through the filter set - up quickly , then filters against the most obvious threats – like pornography and self - harm sites – will be left on			0
so this is a kind of ‘ default on ’ for houses with children ; it ’s just that it adds much more control for parents about exactly what is restricted			2
we ’ve also said that providers need to work to verify the age of the person setting the controls – meaning that children ca n’t set up the filters themselves			2
let me reiterate the key points : with our new system , every parent will be prompted to protect their child online			0
if they do n’t make choices , protection will be automatically on			0
no other government has taken such radical steps before			0
and once all this is in place , @entity332 will have the most robust internet child protection measures of any country in the world – bar none			2
to get all this underway , i have appointed @entity29 mp to be my adviser on preventing the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood			1
@entity29 is a passionate campaigner for internet safety and mother of three			1
her job will be to see this through , to get internet companies on board , to do what it takes to protect children and young people online			1
all this comes back to something really important			0
it ’s not just about the internet , or modern technology – it ’s about childhood			1
these should be distinct and precious years , full of security and love , untainted by the worries and complexities of adulthood			0
from one parent to another , i pledge to do whatever i can to preserve that innocence and protect our children			2
