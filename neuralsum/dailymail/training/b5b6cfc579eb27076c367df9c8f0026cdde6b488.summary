the @entity1 woman who was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison this month after attempting to kill her 14 - year - old autistic daughter in a botched murder - suicide , has spoke out from behind bars to detail the morning she planned to die			1
@entity7 's murder - suicide plan was foiled when police rescued her and daughter @entity9 from carbon monoxide poisoning last year			1
the fact that @entity9 - called @entity12 - remained unconscious for four days after the incident , and @entity7 was easily resuscitated , has been used as evidence by members of her now ex-husband @entity17 's family that she only ever meant to kill her daughter			1
but @entity7 has maintained that her depression was real and that she was pushed to hopelessness the day she picked up her then 14 - year - old daughter from a special treatment facility her insurance company had stopped paying for			1
for months , the mother of three had been writing a blog about the trials and tribulations of raising a daughter who physically abused her , and of whom she feared - even posting pictures of her wounds and videos of @entity12 's violent attacks			1
the two survived the attempt behind bars : the mother of three ( pictured right ) was sentenced in october to 10 - 22 years in prison after pleading guilty to felony child abuse while @entity12 had been doing well at the facility , @entity7 lost faith that she would ever be able to control her daughter when the teen hit her in the head upon arriving home that day			1
after another beating two days later , @entity7 hatched a plan to kill her daughter and then commit suicide , believing it would make life easier for her husband and their two other children			1
' we will be done with autism completely , ' @entity7 wrote in present tense , in a letter to @entity63 from behind bars			2
' she is going to be 100 per cent happy			0
she is going to be 100 per cent @entity65 and i can not wait to see that child			0
' the evening of @entity67 2013 , @entity7 started tying up loose ends with her family			0
she finished the laundry , told her son @entity71 how proud she was of him and gave youngest daughter @entity72 a bracelet which read ' @entity74 '			0
injuries : before her attempt at murder - suicide , @entity7 wrote a blog about raising an autistic teen and shared these pictures of her injuries after violent episodes with her daughter the next morning , @entity7 woke up happy and eager to carry out her plan			1
' i am so excited because we are going to be in @entity86 before noon , ' she recalled			0
' for the first time in my life i am going to be able to have a real conversation with her , and see her			0
get to know her , without the perseverations and the aggression			0
' first , she drove @entity71 and @entity72 to school and texted @entity12 's caretakers that they had the day off			0
then she packed up the back of the van with a mattress , pillowcases from each of her kids ' beds , a shirt from her husband and a hibachi grill			1
@entity7 took her daughter to a wooded area near a hiking trail she had visited with a friend before , parked the car and got out the grill to make s'mores			1
after letting @entity12 eat two of the treats , she gave her daughter a double dose of @entity115 , a drug that helps combat her aggression and makes her sleepy and tucked her into the van			2
conclusion : @entity7 ( left ) told @entity63 that she thought life would be easier for her husband and two other children if she and @entity12 ( right ) were gone the mother then brought the still - smoldering grill into the van and closed all of the doors , hoping the trapped smoke would kill them both			1
@entity7 recalls the last moments before passing out , saying she and @entity12 talked about their pets and all of the items they would bring on a vacation to @entity134			1
she says they laid down on the mattress , nose to nose , and shared a final ' i love you ' with each other			0
but when police discovered the car that evening , they described the scene with a few notable differences in their reports			0
first of all , @entity12 was not laying down next to her mother but strapped in to the front seat , her throat ' raw as a hamburger ' , her mouth foaming and unresponsive			2
meanwhile , @entity7 was found in the back seat , laying on the mattress stripped down to her underwear with a considerably lower body temperature and carbon monoxide poison intake than her daughter			2
arrested : @entity7 pictured after her september 2013 arrest			0
she has since let her naturally darker hair grow out to replace the bleach blonde while @entity12 spent the next few days on a ventilator fighting for her life , @entity7 was easily revived and was already talking to paramedics responding on the scene			1
@entity7 was arrested and charged with attempted murder - charges her attorney @entity168 hoped to fight with an insanity plea			1
but @entity7 ruined those changes when she gave an interview with dr @entity172 from behind bars , ruining their case that the attempted murder was n't premeditated			2
two weeks before her murder case was set to go to trial , @entity7 conceded by taking a plea deal			2
on september 9 she pleaded guilty to charges of felony child abuse			0
at her exceptionally long sentencing , friends defended her as a good mother who baked her kids cookies after school			0
from the other side of the court , her ex-husband 's family spoke out to call her ' evil '			0
@entity7 herself let guilt get to her behind bars , letting her natural hair grow out and replace its usually black blonde and aging several years from the pretty football coach 's wife she was before			0
' i am not worthy to speak her name , ' @entity7 said of her daughter at sentencing , asking the judge for 15 years in prison			2
' she is not the monster			0
' @entity7 was sentenced to 10 - 22 years in prison			1
single parent : father @entity207 now has full custody of @entity12 and the other two children he had with now ex-wife @entity7			2

@entity7 is currently serving a 10 - 22 year prison sentence for attempting to kill herself and 14 - year - old autistic daughter @entity9
the mother of three says she came up with the murder - suicide plan after getting repeatedly beaten by her often - violent daughter
*authorities* foiled that plan when they found the mother and daughter passed out in a car filled with smoke from a hibachi grill
in - laws say @entity7 never planned to die , since she was easily revived and @entity12 spent days on a ventilator fighting for her life
