the 22 - year - old from @entity13 , @entity14 , now has her foot in the place of her knee , but rotated 180 degrees			1

she had been studying performing arts in @entity53 when doctors first discovered she had the disease in her thigh			2
she stayed in @entity57 for the next year , undergoing chemotherapy and an operation to remove the tumour			2
after being given the all - clear , she returned to @entity62 to the home she shared with her parents and two sisters			2

she is now waiting to be fitted with a new artificial lower limb , which will be attached to the joint created from her foot			2
she flew back to @entity62 and was taken to @entity91 in @entity92 for more tests where doctors confirmed the cancer had returned and she was facing the amputation of her leg			2
the 22 - year - old said : ' the pain was worse than ever and i just could n't move it			1
' it was so scary , especially in light of the fact that the more times you get cancer , the less likely chemotherapy is going to work			0
' in all honesty , you just have the fear that you are going to die			0
' it 's there in the back of your mind all the time			0
' doctors then told her she could either have a leg completely amputated or undergo the rotationplasty			2

miss @entity48 , pictured with her parents , @entity134 and @entity135 and her sister , @entity136 , is now waiting to be fitted with a new artificial lower limb , which will be attached to the joint created from her foot ' they told me they could get rid of my thigh and use the bottom part of my leg to replace the top part and my foot would become my knee			1
' they would have to turn it 180 degrees because of the way the foot bends so it would bend the same way as a knee			1
' it was really hard to hear			0
' when they told me i had an option to keep my leg , this was n't what i wanted to hear			0
' miss @entity48 said : ' it seemed like i would have a better quality of life as i could have a prosthesis fitted			0
' i have been on crutches since i had the first operation so it 's been a couple of years now			0
it is hoped miss @entity48 will be walking unaided again before @entity165 ' that 's my main way of getting around and i use a wheelchair			0
' hopefully , before @entity165 , i will be walking unaided again			0
' she added : ' i 've always been independent and i hate to feel dependent when i 'm in a wheelchair or having to use the walking aids			0
' there 's not so much going out now but i will be able to walk unaided if i get a prosthesis so that 's my aim now			0
' mr @entity175 , an orthopedic oncology surgeon at the @entity176 , @entity45 , carried out miss @entity48 's procedure			0
he said : ' @entity6 had already had treatment in @entity57 for a thigh tumour and unfortunately we needed to remove the whole of her thigh bone			1
' instead of leaving her without a leg , we connected her shin bone to the remaining thigh bone , creating a knee joint from her foot			1
' the idea of the operation is where we turn the foot around and move it up , so @entity6 could have a below the knee prosthesis			1
' otherwise she would have had to have an amputation and would have been left with no leg at all			2
' it is very technical surgery and i perform it about three a year - usually on young patients			1
' the aim of the surgery is so the patients can walk , and in clothes will look completely normal			0
' of course , out of clothes it looks a little unusual but we do it to offer patients the best functionality they can			0
most patients will eventually be able to walk unaided			0

@entity6 's bone cancer meant her thigh had to be amputated
the 22 - year - old 's lower leg was then moved up in the place of her thigh
now has a new knee joint made using the foot from her left leg
this has been rotated to 180 degrees , leaving her heel at the front
this provides a natural angle most similar to how a normal knee bends
