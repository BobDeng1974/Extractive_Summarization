he was less than chiselled as @entity1 in @entity2			1
but four hours a day of workouts and a virtually vegan diet transformed @entity5 into the trim hunk seen in his new film @entity7			1
‘ it was hard work and i had to change my metabolism , ’ says @entity5 , 31			1
he tackled gym circuits and weights in the morning and martial arts in the afternoon , with a trip to the gun range at lunchtime			1
changing it up : @entity5 has undergone a complete body overhaul for his new film , left , and is looking quite different from his days on @entity2 ‘ the martial arts is very interesting			1
it ’s about discipline and a focus which enables a certain change to take place , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’m more aware of what i ’m putting into my body			1
i worked with a nutritionist who ’d worked with other actors for this sort of physical preparation			1
' it ’s about an awareness of what you ’re eating rather than having a particular diet			1
we all metabolise things differently and respond to different forms of exercise			1
’ careful with the pressure : @entity41 may need to calm the campaign following new research in the last days of campaigning ahead of this thursday ’s @entity47 referendum vote , @entity44 and @entity45 should take heed of a new study that has revealed stressing out voters can directly affect turnout			1
scientists found that people with high levels of the stress hormone cortisol are less inclined to put a cross in the box			2
the study , published in @entity59 , found that cortisol played a role in people ’s willingness to vote			2
researchers at the @entity65 collected saliva samples from 105 volunteers who were either highly conservative or highly liberal			2
@entity68 was collected before and after an afternoon of activities designed to both increase and lower stress			2
levels of cortisol were measured , as well as voting behaviour in six elections			2
the researchers believe political participation is highly stressful and therefore those with a lower cortisol level would be more likely to vote			2
fish and chips are getting healthier			0
in march , @entity82 offered interested fish - and - chip shops 3kg of their low - sodium salt as well as shakers with fewer holes so that less salt is dispensed			0
this means customers eat 66 per cent less sodium			0
a bag of chips may contain 3.9g of salt , almost two - thirds of the recommended daily intake			0
so far , 400 fish - and - chip shops nationwide have signed up to the initiative			0
but as there are 10,000 chippies in the @entity100 , this is still a drop in the ocean			0
see @entity102 for your nearest participating chip shop			0
the healing powers of electromagnetic therapy have been given added credence by a new trial into the effects of the home - use product @entity110 – which delivers low - level , safe electromagnetic pulses to provide pain relief			0
the placebo - based double - blind study looked at 154 patients with knee pain			0
significant improvements were shown in three important measures associated with osteoarthritis : pain , ease of movement and quality of life			0
seventy - eight per cent experienced benefits , and pain reduction was over 50 per cent			0
how does it work ? blood flow in the body is regulated by electric signals that travel along nerves			1
electromagnetic therapy modifies the nerve signals , providing pain relief by enhancing blood flow , thus reducing inflammation and stimulating healing .			0
