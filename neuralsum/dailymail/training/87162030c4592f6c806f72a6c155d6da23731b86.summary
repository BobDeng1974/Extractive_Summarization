by @entity0 published : 16:13 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 20:24 est , 14 december 2012 price war : supermarkets are competing to offer the lowest priced @entity3			1
@entity5 champagne , pictured , is being sold by @entity6 for only £ 10 , usually costing £ 23.98 a bottle well , it looks like champagne and it tastes like champagne , but it does n’t clean out the wallet like champagne			1
this @entity3 , in an unprecedented supermarket price war , the cost of the most famous , most expensive of festive drinks has plummeted to record lows			1
@entity19 is selling its premier cru champagne for £ 14.99 a bottle			1
@entity22 is doing its @entity24 non-vintage brut for £ 12.75 , on a multi-buy deal			2
and @entity26 has halved the price of its @entity28 to £ 14.99			1
but the really staggering deals are on offer at the cheaper supermarkets			2
@entity6 ’s @entity32 normally goes for £ 23.98 a bottle — but you can now get it for £ 10 , until january 3			1
and the deal of deals comes from @entity37 , which is selling its sparkling for under £ 10 : its non-vintage @entity40 et @entity39 is going for only £ 9.99			1
and , just like a gift - wrapped puppy , it ’s not just for @entity3 — the deal will continue into the @entity44			0
the question is , how on earth can supermarkets afford to sell their champagne at such rock - bottom prices ? and , perhaps more importantly for consumers , is it drinkable ? in all its essential elements , the @entity37 champagne follows the time - honoured rules of the drink			1
it ’s made from traditional champagne grapes — a third chardonnay , a third pinot noir , a third pinot meunier — using the double fermentation method that produces the famous bubbles			2
its alcohol level is 12 per cent — a classic figure for champagne			2
and it does n’t taste too bad , either			0
‘ of course it ’s not a premier cru [ a top champagne ] at that price , but it ’s been well received ; it ’s won awards , ’ says @entity68 , spokeswoman for @entity37			1
the official @entity37 tasting notes proclaim that ‘ this award - winning champagne is elegant and fresh ’ , with an ‘ intense nose of baked apple , brioche and stone fruits with gorgeous flavours of apples , red fruit and minerality on the palate ’			1
luxury : @entity87 's @entity86 is known for its distinctive sparkling wines objective experts have n’t trashed it , either			0
one broadsheet wine writer calls it ‘ bright and fresh , if a little one - dimensional ’			0
still , even one dimension is n’t half bad for less than a tenner			0
but how exactly can @entity37 get the price so low ? the maths suggest it ’s near impossible to turn a profit on a bottle costing £ 9.99			1
you need 2.2lb of grapes for a single bottle of champagne			2
at current market rates , that will cost you £ 4.38			2
excise duty on top of that is £ 2.43 , and vat , at 20 per cent , must be paid on the total — another £ 1.36			2
already we ’re up to £ 8.17 , and we still have n’t paid for bottling , warehousing , shipping and distribution			0
those overheads vary but , altogether , the total cost price is almost certain to match or exceed the selling price of £ 9.99			1
until november 22 , @entity37 was selling it for £ 12.99 , but it has been slashed to its current price since then — and there it will remain well into 2013			1
so how do supermarkets like @entity37 and the others make their money , if at all ? the suspicion is that deals like these are loss leaders — they draw our attention , get us through the supermarket doors and then we spend money on other full - price items while we are there			1
they are also sometimes described as ‘ crosstown deals ’			0
they encourage customers to make a special trip to discount supermarkets — which are often on the fringe of town — to take advantage of these low prices , and then end up spending lots more money on other goods , too			1
and plenty of us are happy to make that trip — the @entity145 drink more champagne than any other nation except @entity87			2
though prices this year seem to have reached new lows , there have been one - off @entity3 deals like this before			0
several years ago , @entity153 offered a limited supply of champagne at £ 5 a go — that was clearly a loss leader and a publicity stunt which could not prevent the chain going bust			2
this year , the cuts are widespread and , in many cases , last well beyond @entity3			0
there is a genuine , long - term price war being waged			1
the supermarkets refuse to admit whether they are actually losing money on any of these deals			0
the last thing they want to be accused of is underpricing booze , just at a time when the government is considering introducing minimum alcohol pricing to deter problem drinkers			0
‘ @entity37 works with its suppliers to get the best possible deal , but we ca n’t really go into our business model , ’ says @entity68 of @entity37			2
‘ our buyers spend a lot of time looking for the right champagne , and they will go to the smaller suppliers to find it			0
’ one smaller supplier in question is the respected family champagne house of @entity189 , based near @entity190 , in the heart of the @entity86			0
‘ we ’re very happy with selling our champagne to @entity37 , ’ says @entity40			1
‘ yes , £ 9.99 is a very low price but that is marketing by the supermarket			1
it has nothing to do with us			0
it does n’t affect how much they pay us for our champagne			0
we still make a good profit on our sales to them			0
’ @entity6 has gone through a very similar process to end up with its £ 10 champagne , finding a small family company and building a close relationship with them			1
its @entity32 — winner of a bronze award in the 2012 @entity210 — is produced by the family company of @entity212 and is made with grapes harvested around the village of @entity215 in @entity216 , south of @entity190			0
cheap : @entity37 's @entity40 et @entity39 , left , is selling for £ 9.99 , while @entity19 's premier cru champagne , right , is selling for £ 14.99 @entity219 , @entity6 ’s champagne buyer , chose it because it is ‘ fresh and easy - drinking ’			1
tasting it myself , it has a certain amount going for it			0
just like the @entity37 champagne , it ’s made from a mixture of chardonnay , pinot noir , and pinot meunier grapes , and is 12 per cent in alcohol volume			1
@entity230 gold in colour , it has a distinctly christmassy nose of burnt apple			0
if i ’m brutally honest , it is ever so slightly acrid , with a lingering , bitter aftertaste			0
but give it a real @entity238 chill in the freezer just before @entity3 lunch , and your mother - in - law wo n’t tell the difference			0
once again , the question is : how is @entity6 managing to sell it so cheap ? ‘ we ’re able to sell champagne at such fantastic prices due to our size and the volume of our orders , ’ @entity6 ’s @entity219 says , before adding : ‘ we take our role as a responsible alcohol retailer seriously , which is why we committed to never selling alcohol as a loss leader and always sell at cost , plus vat and duty			1
’ with price cuts like this , the supermarkets are hoping to shift more champagne than ever this @entity3			1
@entity219 expects a 10 per cent uplift in sales of the drink , compared with last year			2
but you wo n’t find these sorts of prices on champagne from the famous houses — the @entity270 , the @entity271 and the @entity272			1
even in these recession - hit times , the gilt - edged names still gain their brand value from being reassuringly expensive			0
debate : the multitude of champagne being sold at bargain prices has stirred debate amongst wine critics expensive : wines from the region are usually expensive , leading some to question how supermarkets can afford the discount prices yet the very name champagne still carries a cachet even at the cheap end of the market — a cachet jealously guarded by the handful of vineyards in the @entity86 of northern @entity87 through their representative body , the @entity294			1
‘ @entity3 discounts are great value for money for the consumer , ’ says @entity295 , spokesman for the @entity294			0
‘ but they do n’t support the image of champagne in the best way			0
they make champagne look cheap when it is n’t cheap to make — thanks to the production process and the limited amount of produce			0
‘ and the price promotions at @entity3 are paid for by higher prices for the rest of the year			2
’ but the odd thing is that even the £ 10 bottle from @entity6 still carries a certain prestige thanks to the word ‘ champagne ’ , emblazoned in large letters on its label , metal cap and gold foil wrapper			1
it still has all the customary thrills of champagne : it opens with a satisfying pop , a blast of icy smoke and that overflowing stream of minuscule bubbles			0
and there is no mention of @entity6 anywhere on the bottle or its wrapper			2
of course , we want our champagne to be as dirt cheap as possible — but we do n’t want @entity339 to know exactly how cheap it is when she ’s knocking it back during the @entity343			0
@entity344 never goes out of fashion — nor does a bargain			0
the £ 10 bottle of champagne is a rare combination of the tw			1
