they dumped the body of the father - of - one in the @entity134 in south east @entity25 on may 22 last year			0
plot : @entity13 and @entity14 lay in wait near the barracks and picked @entity100 to kill after assuming he was a soldier because he was wearing a @entity138 hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack they dumped the body of the father - of - one in the @entity134 and then waited for armed police to arrive hoping they would be ' martyred ' @entity13 and @entity14 lay in wait near the barracks and picked @entity100 to kill after assuming he was a soldier because he was wearing a @entity138 hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack			2

explaining his decision to give @entity13 a whole - life term , trial judge @entity160 said he was the leader of the murderous plot and had ' no real prospect of rehabilitation '			2
