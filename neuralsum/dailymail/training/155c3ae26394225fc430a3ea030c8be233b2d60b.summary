by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 11:16 est , 9 may 2013 accident and emergency services have ‘ deteriorated significantly ’ , according to @entity4 officials			1
launching its @entity5 and @entity6 , @entity7 said the number of organisations failing to meet waiting time targets has doubled over the last year			1
the organisation said that many factors have contributed to the decline of the service including the increasing numbers of patients , seasonal illnesses such as the winter vomiting bug , and delays in admittance and discharge of patients			0
@entity7 said the number of organisations failing to meet waiting time targets has doubled over the last year the problems could also have been exacerbated by the introduction of the @entity4 service and pressure on social care budgets , an @entity7 document suggests			1
‘ @entity32 performance has deteriorated significantly over the last six months , ’ the document says			2
‘ long waiting times in @entity32 departments ( often experienced by those awaiting admission and hence ill patients ) not only deliver poor quality in terms of patient experience , they also compromise patient safety and reduce clinical effectiveness			1
’ in the last quarter of 2011/12 a third of hospitals did not meet the target of having 95 per cent of @entity32 patients seen and discharged or admitted within four hours			1
for the last quarter of 2012/13 , two thirds of hospitals failed to meet the target , figures show			1
@entity7 has ordered local health authorities to form ‘ urgent care boards ’ which will create plans to improve the service in place by the end of the month			2
‘ when pressure builds across the health and social care system , the symptoms are usually found in the @entity32 department , ’ said @entity7 's national director for acute episodes of care , professor @entity60			1
‘ i 've lived that environment for 30 years and i know just how tough it can be			0
the problems could have been exacerbated by the introduction of the @entity4 service and pressure on social care budgets ‘ what we all want is great service for patients that meets and often exceeds the minimum standards			2
‘ to get there , we need the whole @entity4 system , in the community and hospitals , to recognise the problems and help to relieve the pressure on their colleagues in @entity32			1
‘ in the longer term we need to combine all the expertise in the @entity4 to determine how best to organise emergency care in future so that people get appropriate , effective and rapid care whenever and wherever it is needed			0
’ the organisation has already launched a review to try and get to the root of the problems , and @entity7 medical director professor sir @entity96 is looking into the urgent and emergency care system across the country			0
the news comes after the health and social care regulator warned that demand on @entity4 accident and emergency departments is ‘ out of control ’ and ‘ totally unsustainable ’			2
@entity106 , chairman of the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) , said there should be widespread closures of hospital beds and investment in community care to tackle the increasing burden on emergency care			0
mr prior said that far too many patients were arriving at hospital as emergency cases - a crisis which could be averted by earlier intervention through care in the community			0
this has put such pressure on the health care system that it is at the brink of collapse , he said , meaning regulators can not guarantee that there will never be another care disaster such as that in @entity133			0
hundreds of patients may have died needlessly at @entity136 - many patients were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days , forced to drink water from vases or given the wrong medication			0
@entity142 , chairman of the public inquiry into the ‘ disaster ’ at @entity145 , highlighted ‘ appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people ’ at the trust between 2005 and 2009 .			0
