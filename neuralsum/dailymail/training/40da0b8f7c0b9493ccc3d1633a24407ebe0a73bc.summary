by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:36 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 17:58 est , 2 september 2012 @entity2 got a rave review during this week 's church service as his close friend hotel billionaire @entity5 praised the presidential candidate for bringing positive attention to their shared religion			1
' there has never been as much positive attention to the church , thanks to the wonderful campaign of @entity2 and his family , ' the 80 - year - old @entity5 said at sunday service at the @entity17 in @entity18			1
the quick note of praise comes just days after the @entity21 , where the candidate and his wife both spoke personally about their @entity25 beliefs and also highlighted members of their church who spoke to the nationally televised audience about @entity2 's role in the lay organization			1
devout : @entity2 and @entity31 have begun speaking more openly about their religious beliefs , including their speeches during the @entity21 though only a select few members of the candidate 's press pool were allowed into the @entity17 for today 's service , @entity35 reports that @entity40 feels that , because of the campaign , the church is ' coming out of obscurity			1
he also cited an unattributed statistic that 90 per cent of all media reports relating to @entity2 's faith have ' been favorable '			2
' that 's a great tribute to @entity2 and @entity31 and their family for living such an exemplary life , ' he said			1
' now that we 're out of obscurity , everybody is looking at us and saying , " are you as good as the @entity55 ? " ' @entity56 reports that @entity57 and mrs @entity31 , who were sitting in the sixth row of the church in @entity60 , had little visible reaction to the comments			2
the former @entity64 governor and hotel magnate have been close friends , as were generations of their family			1
@entity2 's father , @entity69 , was in fact so close to @entity72 's father @entity71 that @entity2 named his son after him			1
@entity2 is the politician 's middle name , and his legal first name is @entity77			2
friends in hand : @entity80 handed her umbrella to @entity31 as she walked into the service at @entity60 , @entity18 happy to see you : once inside , @entity80 's husband @entity5 praised the @entity55 and what their openness has done for the public perception of @entity87 the praise for the @entity55 from with their church comes as the candidate 's opponents continue to attack his convention speech last week for failing to mention the military			1
@entity21 campaign strategist @entity94 defended mr @entity2 , pointing out that the previous day he had ' talked about @entity95 ' in an address to a group of veterans			2
' governor @entity2 thought it was a privilege to be speaking to people who had served so nobly , ' mr @entity94 told @entity35			0
as the @entity103 convention starts up in @entity104 , @entity105 this week , the @entity101 will aim to remain in the spotlight by holding daily events on the sidelines , while @entity21 running mate @entity109 will make a speech in nearby @entity111 on monday			0
the @entity112 are n't the only ones who appear to be happy with the @entity2 campaign , as the latest @entity117 tracking poll alleges that mr @entity2 earned 48 per cent of the respondents support while president @entity119 trailed behind with 44 per cent			1
this increase marks a clear change since before last week 's @entity21 when @entity119 was leading			2
sunday was also memorable for mr @entity2 as the day he finally picked up his millionth follower on @entity123 , though he still remains some way behind the president , who has over 19million			0
verbally proud : @entity5 , of the hotel magnate family , praised @entity2 and @entity31 during church on sunday in addition to his verbal praise , mr @entity5 has also pledged a significant amount of financial support to his friend 's campaign			1
federal election filings show that he has pledged $ 1million in personal donations to @entity135 , a political action committee designed to help @entity2 's campaign			1
he is far from alone , as the @entity137 reported in july , about 20 well - connected @entity25 had donated almost $ 8million to the same pac			0
though mr @entity5 kept his remarks about the @entity55 brief , he did talk at length about an interview he had given nearly two decades ago to show how the times have changed regarding the public 's understanding of @entity87			2
he recalled a @entity148 interview with the now - deceased journalist @entity149 , and mr @entity5 talked about the long undergarments that @entity25 wear			2
besides just describing the custom , which involves wearing ' a t - shirt and pair of boxer shorts ' , he talked about how it nearly saved his life			0
' of course the one question that they put on the air was , i understand @entity25 wear different underwear , and i said yes , and he says , " do you ? " ’ mr @entity5 said			0
' i ’d been involved in a very serious boat accident , here in @entity18			0
i caught fire ; my polyester pants had burned off all the way to my waist			0
but my undergarments from my waist down to my knees had not even been singed			0
there was not a mark on them			0
and i said , these holy undergarments saved my life			0
' long - time friends : this undated photo shows @entity178 ( center ) , @entity2 's mother , and mrs @entity71 together			1
the couples were so close that @entity2 ( whose first name is @entity77 ) is named after the elder mr @entity5 mr @entity5 was not the only public figure to praise mr @entity2 this weekend - action star @entity184 also announced his support of the @entity21 in a video he filmed alongside his wife @entity187			1
the message , aimed primarily at evangelical christians , warned : ' our great country and freedom are under attack			0
' we 're at a tipping point and , quite possibly , our country as we know it may be lost forever if we do n't change the course in which our country is headed			0
' mr @entity184 added : ' we can no longer sit quietly or stand on the sidelines and watch our country go the way of socialism or something much worse , ' urging conservative voters to head to the polls on @entity204 .			0
