by @entity1 reporter published : 17:45 est , 23 december 2012 updated : 10:44 est , 24 december 2012 president @entity2 allegedly threatened speaker @entity3 with a public shaming if he held up a compromise on the fiscal cliff negotiations			1
mr @entity2 reportedly said that he was willing to blame the failed negotiations on stubborn republicans in either his inauguration speech or the @entity10 if the two parties were unable to reach an equitable decision			2
the @entity13 reports that mr @entity2 made the threat a number of times , and though nothing has been formally decided as the deadline looms one week from today , the move would be a drastic one , and seen by many as a divisive way to head into his second term			1
that was promptly shot down by the president , with him allegedly retorting : ' you get nothing			2
i get that for free			0
' on @entity40 , some @entity8 worry about the practical and political implications should the @entity8 block a compromise designed to avoid tax increases for most @entity44 and cut the nation 's deficit			2
' it weakens the entire @entity8 , the @entity8 majority , ' representative @entity47 , a @entity8 from @entity48 , said thursday night shortly after rank - and - file @entity8 rejected @entity3 's ' @entity50 ' - a measure that would have prevented tax increases on all @entity44 but million - dollar earners			1
@entity44 president @entity2 delivers a statement on the fiscal cliff at the @entity56 of the @entity57 thursday president @entity2 speaks to reporters about the fiscal cliff in the @entity61 at the @entity57 in @entity62 ' i mean it 's the continuing dumbing down of the @entity8 and we are going to be seen more and more as a bunch of extremists that ca n't even get a majority of our own people to support policies that we 're putting forward , ' @entity47 said			0
' if you 're not a governing majority , you 're not going to be a majority very long			0
' @entity8 are not the only ones bracing for a less - than - stellar situation , as president @entity2 has reportedly scaled back his ambitions for a sweeping budget bargain with @entity8			1
instead , he 's calling for a limited measure sufficient to prevent the government from careening off the ' fiscal cliff ' in january by extending tax cuts for most taxpayers and forestalling a painful set of agency budget cuts			1
in a @entity57 appearance friday , @entity2 also called on @entity86 to extend jobless benefits for the long - term unemployed that would otherwise be cut off for 2 million people at the end of the year			0
the future looked bright : the pair met in november , and were seemingly happy , but the same can not be said now @entity2 's announcement was a recognition that chances for a larger agreement before year 's end have probably collapsed			0
it also suggested that any chance for a smaller deal may rest in the @entity99 , particularly after the collapse of a plan by @entity3 to permit tax rates to rise on million - dollar - plus incomes			1
' in the next few days , i 've asked leaders of @entity86 to work toward a package that prevents a tax hike on middle - class @entity44 , protects unemployment insurance for 2 million @entity44 , and lays the groundwork for further work on both growth and deficit reduction , ' president @entity2 said			2
@entity115 skies cover the @entity116 in @entity62 as @entity86 closes down for the holiday without a compromise on the ' fiscal cliff ' speaker of the house @entity3 , ( left ) and senate majority leader @entity121 ( right with the president ) must compromise together along with president @entity2 on the looming ' fiscal cliff ' ' that 's an achievable goal			1
that can get done in 10 days			0
' maybe , maybe not			0
the latest plan faces uncertainty at best in the sharply divided @entity99			0
@entity8 leader @entity128 of @entity129 , who wields great power even in the minority , called friday for @entity99 action on a @entity57 bill from the summer extending the full menu of bush - era tax cuts			1
he promised that it will take @entity8 votes for anything to clear the @entity99 , where 60 votes are required to advance most legislation			0
@entity3 , giving the @entity8 weekly radio address , said , ' of course , hope springs eternal , and i know we have it in us to come together and do the right thing			2
