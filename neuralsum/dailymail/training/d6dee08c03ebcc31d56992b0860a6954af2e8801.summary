@entity1 @entity0 sen. @entity0 told a cheering crowd of conservatives saturday night that the next @entity5 president should shutter the much - maligned @entity6 and turn the agency 's 110,000 employees loose to police the @entity5 - @entity10 border			1
' that 's slightly tongue - in - cheek , ' he said in @entity13 at the @entity14			2
' but think about it for a second : you travel thousands of miles , you cross over and see 110,000 @entity6 agents ? you 'd turn around and go home ! ' his speech before a partisan crowd of hooting and hollering @entity0 was the main draw at a conference that brought an estimated 3,500 to hear pols including former vp candidate @entity27 , @entity5 sen. @entity28 and rising right - winger dr. @entity29			1
@entity0 delivered a speech full of @entity32 barbs saturday night , touching on immigration , education , foreign policy and religious freedom thousands came to @entity13 , the site of president @entity39 's 2008 presidential nomination , cheering for the man they hope will win the @entity41 in 2016 but @entity0 brought down the house with a speech that sounded as much like practiced campaign stumpery as a laundry list of grievances with @entity39 's administration			1
the normally stolid and bloated @entity49 establishment , @entity0 hinted saturday , is dismayed at his rise to prominence among tea party sympathizers and other grass - roots conservatives , and he wore his outsider status like a badge of honor			1
' i spent most of the week back in @entity58 , ' he began			2
' so it 's great to be back in @entity60			1
' @entity0 described @entity5 politics as a cross between ' poly , meaning many , and tics , meaning blood - sucking parasites			2
' his biggest applause line : ' if you see a candidate that @entity58 embraces , run the other way			2
' he called for the abolition of two conservative bugaboos – obamacare and the @entity74 education standards			1
' education is too important to be left to bureaucrats in @entity58 , ' said @entity0			1
' besides , we already have a " common core " in this country : it 's called the @entity81 of the @entity5			1
' but the @entity1 reserved a special brand of ire for the @entity39 administration 's management of @entity60 's southwest border , where more than 90,000 unaccompanied children from @entity60 will have streamed into the @entity5 illegally by the end of the government 's fiscal year on september 30			1
fresh from a visit to a @entity5 @entity93 station in @entity94 , @entity1 , he said agents told him they apprehended 622 illegal immigrants on friday at that location alone			0
' that was yesterday , ' he said			0
' and roughly 25 per cent of those coming in are unaccompanied minors – little kids brought in by violent drug cartels			0
' when he asked his hosts why they thought the flood of immigrants were risking life and limb to make harrowing journeys northward , @entity0 said , ' every single border patrol agent sitting in the room said the same thing : " they 're coming because the believe they will get amnesty "			0
' @entity0 's prescription for what @entity39 has acknowledged is a ' humanitarian crisis ' is to deport as many of the children back to their home countries as possible , and as soon as possible			1
' the compassionate thing to do is , humanely and expeditiously , to reunite them with their families back home , so we do n't have next year tens of thousands of little boys and little girls being victimized			0
' animated : a high - energy @entity0 told reporters after his speech saturday night that president @entity39 was to blame for providing families with an incentive -- immigration amnesty -- to send their children thousands of miles to the @entity5 with the children have come reports of sexual abuse , hostage taking , and worse			1
on saturday @entity0 re-told anecdotes he has shared publicly before , describing ' coyotes ' – paid human traffickers – extorting money from families in @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 , and sending home body parts of their children when they ca n't pay			2
in some cases , he said , the coyotes threaten some children with instant death if they refuse to cut off fingers and ears of others			0
' the people who are bringing these kids are not well - meaning social workers in @entity158 with long beards , ' he charged			0
' these are vicious , hardened , transnational drug cartels			0
' @entity161 is a @entity0 hobby horse @entity0 rides almost as much as immigration policy			0
on saturday he ripped into the @entity41 for pressing the position in court that religious organizations should n't be exempt from the health insurance law 's requirement to cover abortion - inducing drugs as part of qualifying policies they offer employees			1
in one case wending its way through the judicial system , the @entity173 are opposing that mandate			0
'' let me give you a simple rule of thumb , ' he cracked : ' if you 're litigating against nuns , you 've probably done something wrong			1
' rock star : in conservative circles , the 43 - year - old @entity0 is seen as the @entity39 of 2016 and signs autographs wherever he appears in public near the end of his remarks , @entity0 bulked up his arsenal of foreign policy critiques with broadsides about what he called @entity39 's ' return to @entity194			1
' the two presidents , he claimed , advanced ' the same feckless and naive foreign policy , making the world much , much more dangerous			0
' ' in the last five years we 've seen @entity60 recede from leadership in the world , ' said @entity0 , ' and into that vacuum have stepped nations like @entity203 and @entity204 and @entity205			2
and the world is a whole lot more dangerous place			0
' ' if there 's one principle from time immemorial , ' he said in a line that @entity0 will likely hear in @entity214 and @entity215 , ' it is that bullies and tyrants do n't respect weakness or appeasement			0
' ' and when you have the @entity222 being openly mocked by leaders of nations like @entity204 and @entity203 , it is profoundly dangerous			0
' in one momentary lapse that seemed almost scripted , @entity0 transposed @entity39 and president @entity226 , putting the former in @entity228 in april 1987 to challenge the @entity229			2
' we all remember , ' he said , ' when president @entity39 stood before the @entity231 and uttered the most important words uttered by any leader in modern times : " mr. @entity235 , tear down this wall "			1
' after audience members in the front row told him what he had just said , he conceded that it was ' an interesting slip			0
' recovering quickly , @entity0 asked : ' can we possibly imagine president @entity39 uttering such words ? ' ' look , ' he said , head suddenly bowed			2
' it is heartbreaking , the absence of leadership			0
