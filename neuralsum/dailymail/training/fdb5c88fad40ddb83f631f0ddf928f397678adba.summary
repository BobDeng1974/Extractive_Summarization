non-delivery : postmen in @entity8 have been ordered to boycott homes on ' unmade roads ' , such as @entity25 ( pictured ) because of health and safety fears the move means some residents must make a return journey of almost an hour to collect their post from the sorting office			1
@entity34 and @entity35 , aged 88 and 89 , of @entity25 in @entity7 are among those who have been told that the post they received on saturday was their last			1
mrs @entity35 said : ' @entity18 has said it 's not delivering any mail at all to the unmade roads , and there 's quite a lot in this area			1
' we all had the letter from @entity18 on saturday and it starts now so we did n't even get any warning			1
' the letter stated there had been ' on several occasions a number of near miss accidents ' which prompted a health and safety review that found an ' unacceptable risk ' for delivery to homes on unmade roads			1
but the couple have lived on the road since 1969 and said it had never been a problem before			2
mrs @entity35 said : ' what they could do is park in @entity62 and walk a couple of minutes down the footpath			0
that 's how they used to deliver the mail in the old days			0
' mrs @entity35 said they would now be forced to travel 25 minutes each way to the sorting office to collect their post			2
she said : ' we do n't want to be doing that every day , especially with winter coming			0
' lack of vans ? the move means some residents must now make a return journey of almost an hour to collect their post from the sorting office @entity79 , 66 , who also lives on @entity25 , said : ' the letter arrived on saturday and said this is your last post			2
all of a sudden they 've brought in these changes overnight			0
' it 's got to be a cost - cutting measure and taking vans off the route and someone 's going to lose their job			0
' @entity91 has lived in @entity92 for 30 years and said she will struggle to get to the sorting office because of a spinal disability			0
she said : ' the roads are not made up because we 're on greenbelt , but i 've never known one person to fall off their bike or slip on the road			1
' they 've done it without consultation from everyone or anyone			0
' @entity108 , 60 , of @entity109 has already submitted an initial stage one appeal against the ban			0
in his appeal letter , he wrote : ' i am a trained manager in both health and safety and the preparation of risk assessments so i am aware that you must have an accident record log which i request site of			2
' should you not be able to re-instate deliveries this will be essential at future stages , especially if the residents enlist professional help			0
' @entity18 has three months to respond to the initial appeal , before it can move to stage two and three appeals			1
residents in @entity130 and @entity131 have also been affected			0
@entity18 spokeswoman @entity132 said the decision to suspend deliveries is a temporary measure			1
she said : ' we have reluctantly decided to temporarily suspend deliveries to a number of addresses in a particular part of @entity7			1
' this is because the private , unpaved roads in the area are in a poor state of repair			0
' that poor state of repair has meant some of our vehicles have been damaged and there have been some near accidents for our postmen and women			2
' it is the responsibility of the residents to ensure that private roads are fit for purpose and do not constitute a safety risk			0
this is far from being a trivial matter and we will not compromise on the safety of our colleagues or the roadworthiness of our vehicles			0
