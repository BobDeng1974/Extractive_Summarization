by @entity0 published : 08:31 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 04:27 est , 3 may 2013 even in the brilliant sunshine it was a dark , depressing place to be			0
the blood had long since dried , and everything connected to that night was 60 miles away in evidence bags or captured on police photographs			1
the one thing everyone knew about @entity9 was that this was where @entity11 is said to have been taken when her innocent young life was snatched away			0
in the spectacular @entity48 countryside yesterday , nine women and three men on a murder trial jury visited the house which , the prosecution suggests , she was destined never to leave alive			1
precisely what happened here is something prosecuting lawyers say only one man must know			0
but @entity11 , the former lifeguard accused of april ’s murder , insists he accidentally ran her over and has ‘ no recollection ’ of driving her here to his home as she lay ‘ dead or dying ’ beside him in his @entity65			1
visit : jurors arrive by coach at the home of @entity11 , @entity9 in @entity69 , @entity48 , on the third day of his trial for the abduction and murder of @entity11			2
it is surrounded by trees , outbuildings and a river runs down its left side trial : @entity11 says that he ran april down with his car but can not remember what he did with her because he had been drinking heavily , claims which the prosecution refute poignant : floral tributes and a single candle burns outside the white - washed cottage this morning , which the jurors stopped to look at @entity90 says he was already trying to clean april ’s blood from the rooms as hundreds of volunteers were scouring streets and countryside in the hope of finding her alive			1
@entity99 , 47 , says he wishes only that he could remember where he put her			2
the strong smell of cleaning products that originally greeted detectives had evaporated , the jury were told earlier , but otherwise it was much the same as it would have been that night seven months ago			2
twelve pairs of feet paced quietly around the house ; twelve sombre faces came out , some visibly shaken			0
three bouquets and a teddy bear had been left beneath the @entity9 sign			0
case : the prosecution say dna and bone was uncovered in and around the fire and the bathroom door ( right ) despite a huge cleaning operation by the suspect , @entity11 home : around his possessions blood was also allegedly found on and surrounding this white leather sofa from photographs released by the court , it was possible yesterday to take a virtual tour of the tiny cottage perched on a hillside a short drive from @entity21 , the small market town where april lived			1
at first glance it looks little different from any rural home a middle - aged man might be renting , and certainly just as untidy			0
cans of strong cider that @entity99 bought with that day ’s benefit cheque are on the floor beneath a mounted rifle ; snapshots are framed on the walls ; clothes spill from a laundry basket			2
cottage : the property is in an isolated location , where witnesses say they saw @entity99 pull up there in his @entity65 on the day of her disappearance what is not immediately apparent is the significance of the wood - burning stove in the lounge , a typical feature of homes such as this			1
but this is where fragments of juvenile skull were recovered from the ashes , and where nearby specks of april ’s blood were found			1
not visible on the stove is the former abattoir worker ’s boning knife , which , the jury heard , had a charred handle			0
more blood spots were found in the hallway and bathroom , highlighted with green arrows placed by forensic experts who searched the cottage			1
prosecuting counsel @entity180 has told the jury that @entity99 was ‘ forensically aware ’ and went to extensive lengths to remove potentially incriminating evidence before or after disposing of the body			1
if that was the case , the jury would have seen at first hand the evidence that the attempt did not quite work			0
later they were taken to the roadside layby near where @entity99 was seen carrying a black bin bag some 13 hours after april disappeared			1
the jury ’s day trip from @entity193 began with the same chronology that unfolded on october 1 last year , with a visit to the spot where april was playing on the street outside her home that evening with a friend			2
the last anyone saw of her , according to the prosecution , was when she got into the passenger seat of @entity99 ’s distinctive @entity205 parked nearby			2
back then , almost the entire town took to the streets to search for april			0
now the same streets were virtually deserted as the jurors , plus a small battalion of court officials , held open - air sessions and a guided tour by coach			2
one face was missing , though – @entity99 , who denies abduction , murder and perverting the course of justice , did not join the tour			1
in the dock : @entity11 drawn in court yesterday , as the jury heard he claimed he had searched for april @entity224 all night , but was seen with a black bin bag by a river the next day had it not been for the police escort , the group might easily have passed as geography field trip enthusiasts of the kind sometimes seen in these parts			1
but the man in an anonymous grey suit was the judge , mr @entity231 , and the coach party included barristers from both sides of the case			0
each time one of them gestured with an arm towards some significant piece of evidence , twelve pairs of eyes followed it			0
among the sights were april ’s school , where @entity99 went on october 1 to his daughter ’s open evening ; the clock tower , where he claims to have ‘ panicked ’ before allegedly losing all recollection of what happened next , and the @entity252 cameras that picked up @entity99 ’s various movements that day until he drove off with april , allegedly to commit what the prosecution claims was a ‘ sexually motivated ’ crime			1
thus , the coach party effectively traced his known route to the point at which he has said his memory now fails him			0
on everyone ’s account , it was april ’s final journey			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
