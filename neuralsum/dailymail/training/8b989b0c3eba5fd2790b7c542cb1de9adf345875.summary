by @entity0 and @entity1 unseasonably cool temperatures will arrive next week in the @entity3 and as far south as @entity4 and @entity5			1
it is not , however , the second coming of a polar vortex , a phrase the @entity12 's @entity11 office tweeted earlier this week to describe the upcoming sweater weather			1
they quickly learned that was n't such a good idea , said @entity17 , a weather service meteorologist who spent a good chunk of friday morning fielding a flood of telephone calls from the media			2
' i think people are pretty sensitive to those words , ' she said			0
polar vortex : a cold front set to hit the @entity3 next week is not another polar vortex , just unseasonably chilly weather cooling off : six - year - old @entity30 runs through the water at the splash pad at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 on thursday			1
but the weather is set to turn chillier soon though @entity38 has weakened since hitting @entity39 , it altered the path of the @entity42 jet stream , allowing polar air behind a trough of low pressure to spill out of @entity46 and into the @entity3 , says @entity48 meteorology director @entity47			1
it 's similar to the polar vortex pattern from the winter that turned much of the country into a freezer for weeks at a time , breaking cold weather temperature records in numerous states			1
but there are key differences , @entity47 says			0
this air mass is coming from western @entity46 and not directly from the arctic , plus the polar vortex is not nearly as strong in the summer — and sometimes breaks down completely			2
between monday and wednesday , temperatures in the @entity3 will be as much as 15 degrees cooler than normal , with the biggest drops seen close to the @entity63 , though people in @entity5 and @entity4 will need to break out pants , too			1
meanwhile , the usually temperate @entity66 should get ready to sweat			0
places like @entity68 could reach 90 or higher next week , @entity47 said			1
january chill : the winter @entity71 brought freezing temperatures and mountains of snow to much of the @entity3 and @entity75 @entity11 would normally see highs in the 80s and lows in the mid- 60s , but the weather service says highs early next week will climb no higher than the mid- 60s — maybe 70 degrees — and lows could dip into the upper 40s			1
the cool spell is coming at the wrong time for some athletes who are preparing for a triathlon in @entity89 next weekend			0
if @entity91 is too cold , the swimming portion wo n't happen			2
' it 's disappointing because you 've done all the preparations for it , ' said @entity96 , who has been coaching several people from suburban @entity11			0
that sound you hear coming up from @entity5 might be thousands or people turning off their money - gobbling air conditioners			2
it could also be the cheers of those who make their living working outside , like the employees at a @entity109 nursery , whose job entails hauling trees and shrubs around town			0
not quite : it 's going to be cold in the midwest next week , but not ' polar vortex ' cold ' we love it , ' @entity117 , marketing manager for @entity118 , said of the forecast for temperatures running about 15 degrees lower than the typical 93 - or 94 - degree july days			1
' any day you do n't get above 100 degrees			0
' further north , the forecast is more bad news at the @entity126 in the western @entity91 community of @entity128 , along @entity129 , near @entity91			2
this summer 's cooler temperatures already have affected business			0
' we are fully booked for weekends here this summer but we are seeing less families spend a week up here , ' office manager @entity132 said			0
' last year , the stays were longer ( and ) i think this may have something to do with the weather			0

unseasonably chilly air is headed for parts of the @entity3 and *northeastern* @entity145 where *residents* have been *sweltering* in 90 degree heat
the @entity12 tweeted that it was part of the @entity71
the weather agency has since *clarified* , noting that the cold front is the result of a shift in the jet - stream
in parts of the @entity63 and @entity3 , the coolest air is *expected* and highs are forecast to be in the 60s and 70s
@entity162 will *struggle* to reach 80 and the chill could even impact @entity164
