mrs @entity6 's eggs were collected and harvested with her husband 's sperm			1
after the treatment they had three viable embryos and one was put back into her womb			0
but before the transfer , doctors at @entity82 suggested using the new glue to give the embryos a better chance of sticking to the womb , mrs @entity6 said : ' we had never heard of anything like this before , but we were willing to give anything a try			1
we had been trying for a baby for 15 years and i 'd never fallen pregnant before in all that time			1
' we knew that time was running out for us , so we wanted to give it everything we could			0

' @entity125 is a viscous ( thick ) solution containing high concentrations of an adherence ( sticky ) compound called @entity130			0
adherence of the embryo to the lining inside the womb will aid implantation			2
@entity130 is naturally present in the fluid in both the ovaries and the womb , and the level is known to rise in the womb at the time of embryo implantation			2
the exact mechanism by which @entity130 promotes implantation has not yet been identified , however scientists believe that it assists implantation by : @entity125 can be used for the transfer of cleavage stage embryos and blastocysts in both fresh and frozen cycles and can therefore benefit any patient undergoing @entity31 treatment			0
studies have demonstrated that @entity125 is particularly beneficial for patients who are over 35 years old , patients with a history of failed implantation and for patients with unexplained infertility .			0
