most children of her age would struggle to sit through an opera			1
but at just seven years old , @entity4 has already composed her own			1
the talented youngster has become a classical music sensation after her first major composition was highly commended by the @entity8			1
and not only is @entity9 an accomplished composer , she is also a skilled violinist and pianist			1
gifted : @entity4 can play both the piano and violin and , at the age of seven , has composed her own opera videos of her work have been viewed more than 300,000 times since her father shared them on @entity20 – and her abilities have led to comparisons with @entity23 , who by five had mastered the keyboard and violin and started composing			1
@entity9 wrote her own sonata at the age of six , followed by her opera , @entity28 , this year			1
she said : ‘ the music comes to me when i ’m relaxing			2
i go and sit down on a seat or lie down			2
i like thinking about fairies a lot , and princesses , and beautiful dresses			2
’ she added that her best compositions are created when she is on the swing in the garden at her home in @entity39 , @entity40 , but she keeps a tape recorder by her bed for when inspiration strikes			2
the idea for @entity28 – which narrowly missed out on a place in the final of an @entity8 contest for adult composers – came in a dream			1
take note : @entity9 had mastered the keyboard and violin and started composing by the time she was five she said : ‘ @entity23 composed this piece in my dream and when i got up , i sat down and played it and my father recorded it			1
’ @entity9 ’s father @entity60 , an @entity61 - born linguist and amateur flautist , said he realised his daughter had a connection with music when she was a baby			2
she was given her first violin for her third birthday and in less than a year she was playing @entity69 sonatas			2
supportive : sisters @entity71 and @entity9 with their parents @entity72 and @entity60 mr @entity75 and his wife @entity72 , 39 , who was an organ scholar at @entity76 , moved with @entity9 and her four - year - old sister @entity71 from @entity76 to @entity40 so that they could be closer to the specialist @entity80 in @entity81 and @entity9 has weekly piano and violin lessons with teachers from the school			0
the rest of the time , she is taught at home , and practises and composes for between four and five hours a day			0
but her parents refuse to let her take part in competitions or music exams , and have turned down invitations to appear on television shows			0
mr @entity75 added : ‘ she works hard but she has a very happy childhood and we are absolutely determined to protect this			0
’ @entity9 's still too little for her feet to touch the ground when she 's playing the piano			0
a pile of books help her when she practises and composes at home although comparisons with @entity23 are inevitable , @entity9 is determined to maintain her own identity @entity9 , meanwhile , is working on a cello sonata that she was commissioned to write after performing one of her compositions in @entity110			1
‘ it ’s not the same style as my first sonata , ’ she explained			1
‘ it ’s very dramatic			0
it ’s more like @entity116 than @entity23			0
’ when she is older , she wants a ‘ big house full of instruments , all sorts of pianos and violins , violas and cellos ’			0
‘ i do n’t mind if i am famous or not , i just want to be good , ’ she added			0
‘ i look at other composers but i ’m not trying to become exactly like @entity23			0
yeah , i like him , but i ’m going to be like @entity9 , not @entity23			0

first major composition highly commended by the @entity8
@entity4 is also a skilled violinist and pianist
she started composing at the age of five and wrote a sonata aged six
