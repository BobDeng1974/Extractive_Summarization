he and social worker @entity17 , 40 , acted out a violent robbery in which @entity17 attacked him minutes after he opened up the shop			1
but police later checked @entity11 's phone and found a picture of the robber 's outfit , including overalls and the mask			1
plot : @entity11 ( left ) staged a fake robbery on his shop with his boyfriend @entity17 ( right ) and the pair have now been jailed fatal error : detectives looked at @entity11 's mobile and found these pictures : him in the balaclava and the overalls used @entity11 and @entity38 , both of @entity16 , each admitted charges of theft and perverting the course of justice			1
@entity11 was jailed for 34 months and skate for 26 months			1
@entity45 heard everything initially went to plan with @entity38 , wearing a balaclava and overalls , bursting on the scene armed with a broom handle to give the impression he had a gun			1
items were rearranged in the shop to make it look as if a real robbery had taken place and a light fitting was smashed to give added effect			2
@entity11 was locked in a store room before @entity17 fled from the scene with £ 8,000 cash and £ 150 worth of cigarettes			1
the bogus robbery sparked a serious crime inquiry but he was caught out when officers checked his phone and discovered a photograph of the same set of clothes he had described the robber as wearing			1
the pair went on to confess that they specially bought the clothes for @entity38 to wear during the fake hold - up			2
now @entity11 is behind bars along with his partner skate , who switched careers late in life and obtained a degree from @entity83 as a mature student before finding employment with @entity86 working with vulnerable adults			1
the alarm was raised when an early morning customer called at the @entity91 's newsagents at the @entity92 , @entity16 , and found the door locked			1
she alerted staff at a nearby store and police were called			1
officers were at the scene within minutes			0
crime : @entity11 was locked in a store room at this @entity102 in @entity16 before @entity17 fled from the scene with £ 8,000 cash and £ 150 worth of cigarettes @entity106 , prosecuting , said : ' they found @entity11 cowering in a storeroom which had been secured from the outside preventing him from leaving			1
' he appeared to be in great fear			0
it was taken extremely seriously by the police			2
' @entity11 told officers he had been attacked by a man with an @entity116 accent and went on to make a 12 page witness statement in which he described the balaclava and overalls worn by the raider			1
mr @entity106 told the court : ' he described in close detail the man 's clothing and the fact that he had a shotgun with him			2
' police sealed off the shopping centre and set up a major incident investigation with officers poring over @entity132 footage from the area in a bid to identify the robber			2
but during the inquiry @entity11 told officers he had left his mobile at home that morning			1
mr @entity106 added : ' @entity11 referred to the fact that he owned a @entity141 which was at his house			1
the police went to check that and were somewhat surprised that mr @entity11 's mother told them he also had an @entity10 as well			1
' on the i - phone was a photograph of the set of overalls and the balaclava he had described as being worn by the robber			2
' defence : @entity11 acted out of desperation because of his financial situation and @entity17 says he was pestered into it by his partner the focus of the police investigation switched to @entity11 and skate who both went on to confess that they had staged the robbery			1
all but a few hundred pounds of the money was subsequently recovered from where it had been buried by @entity38 in a relative 's garden			0
mr @entity106 said : ' the two men were partners			0
@entity11 had taken out a joint mortgage with his mother on a property			2
that mortgage fell into arrears			0
that would seem to be the catalyst which caused him to hatch a plot to stage a fictitious robbery on the shop where he worked			0
' the plan was that @entity38 would dress up as a robber			0
he would go to the store and a fake armed robbery would be carried out			2
' judge @entity184 told them ' these sentences are to deter others from committing this kind of offending which is a very easy thing to do			0
' @entity190 , for @entity11 , said ' it was an act of desperation by mr @entity11			2
not only was he to be made homeless but his mother also			0
he was in a state of despair			0
he saw no other way out of his problems other than this severely misconceived notion of taking this money from his place of work			0
' @entity202 , for @entity38 , said ' he initially said no but he was pestered into getting involved			0
he was blinded by affection for his partner			0
he simply can not understand how he got himself involved in this			0
' @entity206 , @entity207 for @entity208 said “ the deception perpetrated by these two defendants caused widespread concern and fear within their community when it was suspected that an armed robbery had taken place			0
' they thought they had committed the perfect crime			0
however , nothing could be further from the truth			0
their deception was quickly uncovered and the evidence against them so overwhelming , they had no option but to plead guilty both for the theft and for perverting the course of justice in attempting to hide their crime			0
