by @entity0 it is 3,341 years since @entity2 was laid to rest in one of the most opulent tombs ever crafted by human hands			0
the gilded wood walls dotted with blue porcelain , giant casket , and 16 - foot shrine lay undetected until @entity11 archaeologist @entity10 found it in 1922			1
since then , billions have flocked to visit the 19 - year - old ruler 's resting place in @entity17 's @entity16 - and the delicate chamber is starting to crumble			1
recreation : designers , scientists and historians have worked for years using these 3d scanners to create exact replicas of the 19 - year - old ruler 's resting place in a desperate bid to protect the famous tomb , an exact replica has been built almost next door in the southern city of @entity32			1
a multinational team of scientists and historians have worked for years mocking up every detail with high - tech 3d scanners			1
it is hoped visitors will go to see the replica instead of causing further damage to the original , which could well be closed to the public eventually			2
without falsely ageing the chamber , the team insists it will feel authentic			0
' i want people to come in and actually say , " my goodness , i ca n't tell the difference ! " , ' @entity45 , the @entity11 head of @entity47 - based company @entity46 which is leading the project , told the @entity49			1
the original : this is @entity2 's mummified body in its original casket surrounded by painted and gilded wood walls that have survived 3,341 years replica : the team , backed by a multinational team of museums , has worked for years to reconstruct the tomb in the hope that they can close the original it will have exactly the same floor , ceiling , walls , gate , lights , sarcophagus and lid			2
scientists are also working to ensure the temperature is the same - but have had to wait until visitors started to arrive to accurately calculate the humidity			0
he added : ' the most important thing is really sound			0
' we have tried to ensure that the acoustics are similar - i have an acoustic archaeologist in my team - but this area of work needs more attention			2
' in a hall between the burial chamber and an antechamber hang photos and explanations of the discovery of the tomb and its treasures			0
the original casket ( left ) was intricately designed by @entity17 in 1327 for their revered 19 - year - old leader , and has now been replicated exactly in similar material ( right ) here , the first panels of the facsimile are erected in the underground chamber prepared near @entity102 in the @entity103 by a multinational team of museums the fascination with @entity10 's story and the perpetual promise of more discoveries has seen tourists pouring into the sun - drenched site although there has been a significant dip in tourism this year as the country has suffered from ongoing political protests			1
@entity45 , is hopeful that the replica will become as popular as the original as visitors ' become part of the force that protects it [ the original ] rather than a force that is leading to its destruction			0
' he told the @entity127 : ' they will have the thrill of visiting something they know is 3,000 years old and they have the guilt of knowing , as they look at it , that their presence is part of the reason why it wo n't be there in another 100 years ' time			0

opulent chamber lay undetected for until 1922 , when it was discovered by @entity11 archaeologist @entity10
billions flocked to @entity16 in @entity32 , south @entity17 , causing so much damage it will have to close soon
museums around the world have *funded* project to replicate every detail of the tomb with high - tech 3d scanners
