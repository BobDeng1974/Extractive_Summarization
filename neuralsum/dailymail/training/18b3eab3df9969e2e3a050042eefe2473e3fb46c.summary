the family of the @entity26 has taken exception to a new biography , @entity5 mirror : the life and art of @entity1 , which they say contains numerous inaccuracies and poses a ' phantom theory ' about his sexuality @entity1 , who lived in @entity33 , @entity34 , illustrated more than 300 covers for the @entity36			1
the family , in its statement , referred to one passage in the book in which @entity42 describes how @entity1 went to schools at recess and stopped little boys on the street , and that such behavior might be seen as problematic in today 's world			1
the passage ignores @entity1 's own explanation in his autobiography that after he persuaded a boy to pose for an illustration , they would go together to ask the child 's mother for permission , the family said			1
‘ she supports this unfounded claim with another phantom theory , that @entity1 was a closeted homosexual , ’ the statement read			1
‘ to link pedophilia and homosexuality in this way is offensive and clearly homophobic			0
’ @entity1 's 1954 work girl at mirror : author @entity42 described the girl 's doll , tossed on the floor as ' a bizarrely sexualized object ' the @entity16 accuses the author of ' highly selective ' use of @entity1 's own autobiography my adventures as an illustrator in an interview in october with @entity79 , @entity42 , who also authored biographies of artists @entity82 and @entity84 , was quoted as saying she did not believe @entity1 had homosexual relationships in his life , but added that he preferred male company and that it was possible to discern ‘ enormous homo - eroticism ’ from his work			1
in @entity92 , a painting of a burly cop and a little boy on adjacent cafe stools , the cop leans toward the boy ‘ as if to emphasize the ... tenderness that can form between a grown man and a little boy ... the hint of homo - eroticism ’ she writes			1
in @entity106 , ’ a young girl in a white slip studies her own reflection — ‘ actually , ’ says @entity42 , ‘ seen from the back , she could be a boy			2
’ and the girl ’s doll , tossed on the floor ? ‘ a bizarrely sexualized object			1
with her right hand buried in her petticoats , the doll could almost be masturbating			2
’ she said she was not attempting to speculate on his psychology			0
the author did not understand @entity1 as a person , the family said , and dismissed suggestions that he was lonely , moody or frequently depressed			1
the author did not understand @entity1 as a person , the family said , and dismissed suggestions that he was lonely , moody or frequently depressed the runaway : @entity42 writes of @entity1 's work that the cop leans toward the boy ' as if to emphasize the ... tenderness that can form between a grown man and a little boy ... the hint of homo - eroticism ' ‘ this is absurd			1
he did not mope , was not a chronic depressive , or a hypochondriac			0
he went through his trials and storms as we all do , but he was someone who ultimately affirmed life , ’ read the statement signed by @entity1 's son , @entity136 , and granddaughter , @entity138			2
the statement , issued by the @entity16 , was released on december 23 in response to a number of reviews that the agency found were to ready to accept @entity42 ’s version of events			2
the family also said it was troubled that the @entity155 , located in @entity33 , had endorsed the book			0
in an oct. 11 news release announcing an upcoming appearance by @entity42 , @entity159 , the museum 's director , called the book ‘ a well - researched and written biography that presents many unique theories and interpretations about the artist			1
’ in a statement provided to the @entity168 , the museum said it was a center for academic freedom and for scholarship about @entity1 's life and that @entity10 was one in a long line of books about the artist			1
author @entity42 accuses @entity1 of being gay , even though he was married three times including to miss @entity178 many of the reviews of @entity13 's @entity179 have accepted her account of his life and work			1
her account is essentially wrong			0
she has neglected or misused the sources which she cites			0
her use of @entity1 's autobiography , my adventures as an illustrator , is highly selective			1
as professor @entity194 of @entity195 states in his online review on @entity197 , ‘ @entity42 has a pronounced tendency to either distort or simply ignore evidence to the contrary			2
’ @entity202 states in today ’s review ( published in the @entity204 on dec 19 ) , ‘ she does seem awfully eager to find homoeroticism – poor @entity1 can not go on a fishing trip without his biographer finding sexual overtones			2
’ keillor comments on @entity42 ’s suggestion that the doll in @entity208 could be masturbating , ‘ well , i suppose that @entity209 could “ almost ” be masturbating ’			1
on page 94 of her book , @entity42 describes how @entity1 would ‘ hang about the schools at recess			1
. and stop little boys on the street			0
. ’ she then comments , ‘ today with our awareness of pederasty scandals ( meaning pedophilia ) this kind of behavior might seem problematic			0
. ’ she then omits a passage just below this in the autobiography that fully explains what really happened – after @entity1 would convince a boy to pose , they would go to ask the mother 's permission			2
on page 101 she comments on his relationship with his models : ‘ the integrity of the boys was never in question			0
but his own character was not nearly so straightforward			0
’ referring to @entity241 's novel , @entity242 , @entity42 writes , ‘ in a way @entity1 was @entity242 ’s discreet and careful twin brother , roused by the beauty of children but ( thankfully ) more repressed			1
’ many of the reviewers have ignored the claim of pedophilia , perhaps because the suggestion of it blows the credibility of the book out of the water			0
the @entity255 by @entity1 : @entity42 now claims that sex is only a ' tiny part ' of her book she supports this unfounded claim with another phantom theory , that @entity1 was a closeted homosexual			1
to link pedophilia and homosexuality in this way is offensive and clearly homophobic			0
we have found at least 68 of these sexual references throughout the book			0
on page 168 she comments on his search for costumes for his models : ‘			0
he did enjoy acquiring clothing from men who caught his eye , as if it were possible to acquire the less tangible parts of them as well			0
’ @entity42 now claims that sex is only a ‘ tiny part ’ of her book			2
but sex is a major theme of the book and her phantom theories color and distort everything , including @entity1 ’s entire character and her interpretations of his art. there is no way to separate her sexual theories from the rest of the book			2
her take on @entity299 is that the man standing is ‘ unattached and sexually available			0
’ @entity42 also omits from the autobiography many accounts of @entity1 's feelings and relationships with women			1
there are also many other factual errors and omissions - we have found at least 96			0
again , this is something that few reviewers seem to notice - they simply do not know enough about @entity1 's life , and are too dependent on @entity42 's flawed account			1
she inadequately interviewed @entity1 's three sons and therefore her account of his life is often inaccurate			2
she gives an incomplete account of a significant difficulty with the @entity36 when the art editor , @entity320 , painted out a horse from one of @entity324 's covers without consulting him			0
@entity42 omits @entity1 ’s difficulties when his abilities were failing - in one instance he painted portraits of the @entity330 family and they were so badly done that mr. @entity330 sent them back and @entity324 returned his check			1
most important of all , @entity42 does n't understand the man , who @entity1 was as a person			1
she says ‘ on most days he was lonesome and loveless			0
he did not mope , was not a chronic depressive , or a hypochondriac			0
he went through his trials and storms as we all do , but he was someone who ultimately affirmed life			0
people liked @entity1 and enjoyed being with him			2
he was interested in people and what they had to say			0
on a personal note , i always had a wonderful relationship with my father , we were especially close when i helped him with his autobiography			0
@entity42 claims that her book is based on an examination of his art and that @entity1 painted mostly men and boys			1
we counted all the @entity36 covers from 1916 - 1951 and all the early covers for life and @entity360			0
there are 172 covers with girls and women , and 141 covers with boys and men			0
her theory is demonstrably wrong			0
@entity1 also did 9 covers of @entity370			2
we 're not sure in which category @entity42 would place @entity370			2
we are troubled and mystified that the @entity155 at @entity33 has endorsed the book			0
this is our last word , we are no longer going to participate in the drama @entity42 has created			2
this book says a lot more about @entity13 than it does about @entity1			1

the family of iconic illustrator @entity1 have taken exception to a new biography
@entity10 author @entity13 has made ' highly selective ' use of her source materials , they claim
@entity42 writes that @entity1 was a closeted homosexual and that it is possible to discern ' enormous homo - eroticism ' from his work
in the painting @entity208 , she describes the girl 's doll as ' a bizarrely sexualized object ' and suggests it ' could almost be masturbating '
