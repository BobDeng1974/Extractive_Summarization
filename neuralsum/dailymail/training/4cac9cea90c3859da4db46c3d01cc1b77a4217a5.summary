customers have complained to clothing giant @entity1 after the chain used two black children to model monkey outfits			1
the apparent slip - up features in the popular out - of - town retailer 's new catalogue on a page advertising children 's animal onesies			1
it prompted one @entity14 user to accuse the firm of racism , while another customer complained the image was extremely unfortunate , deliberate or not			1
unfortunate : customers complained over a @entity1 catalogue which featured two boys ( one of whom is pictured ) in monkey onesies			1
both boys were black , while the other six children wore rabbit and ladybird outfits the two youngsters - both in ape suits - were pictured alongside six white boys and girls dressed as rabbits , a ladybird and a character from the smartphone game @entity37			1
a 40 - year - old father reported the image to @entity41 , complaining : ' we 're living in a sensitive time and you 'd have thought someone would have realised how bad this is			2
' the image also did not go unnoticed on @entity14			2
one user , @ @entity49 , wrote : ' flicking through my @ @entity1 book & i come across this ... they really put the black kids in the @entity55 ? ! @entity56 '			2
another , @entity58 , tweeted to the firm : ' i 'm finding it quite racist '			0
the retailer however said it was disappointed the photograph had been perceived in this way			0
' we regularly work with the two boys and they chose the outfits they wanted to wear , as did all the other children on the shoot			0
' their parents were with them the whole time and they all really enjoyed the day			0
it is very sad that some people have turned this into a race issue , ' a spokesman said			0
' @entity75 ' : one @entity14 user uploaded an image of the catalogue to express her disbelief at the image racist caricatures of black people as monkeys date back more than 100 years , when they were used in cartoons and postcards to dehumanise the people they mocked			1
earlier this year the @entity89 newspaper @entity90 apologised for running a digitally altered photo of @entity93 president @entity92 and his wife @entity94 , which was designed to make them look like monkeys			0
