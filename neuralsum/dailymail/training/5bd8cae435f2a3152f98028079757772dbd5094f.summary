your success at playing a musical instrument could be down to a fatty substance in your brain			0
scientists have discovered that an electrically insulating substance known as myelin is essential to our brains learning new skills			2
they claim that when a skill , such as playing the piano , is learned later in life , myelin must be made in order to retain the skill			1
your success at playing a musical instrument could be down to a fatty substance in your brain			0
scientists have discovered that an electrically insulating substance known as myelin is essential to our brains learning new skills			2
pictured are close up images of myelinated nerve fibres			0
the myelin is shown in pink however , researchers at @entity25 claim that once a new skill has been learnt , it is retained even after myelin production stops			1
they found myelin was produced by the brain and spinal cord into early adulthood as it is needed for many developmental processes			0
although earlier studies of white matter hinted at its involvement in skill learning , the study is the first to confirm it experimentally			1
lab mice tests showed that new myelin must be made each time a skill is learned later in life and the structure of the brain 's white matter changes during new practical activities by increasing the number of myelin - producing cells			1

once a new skill has been learnt , it is retained even after myelin production stops			1
these discoveries could prove important in finding ways to stimulate and improve learning , and in understanding myelin 's involvement in other brain processes such as in cognition , the study published in @entity61 suggested			1
when a child learns to walk or an adult masters a new skill such as juggling , new brain circuit activity is needed and new connections are made across large distances and at high speeds between different parts of the brain and spinal cord			2
@entity80 is a fatty material that coats and insulates nerves			1
it is sometimes compared to the insulating material around an electrical wire			0
its job is to quickly conduct impulses between the brain and different parts of the body			0
the result is faster reactions to danger and a better chance of survival			0
it is made up of around 40 per cent water , while its dry mass is around 20 per cent protein			2
flaws in making myelin result in a number of neurological diseases , including multiple sclerosis ( @entity107 )			0
for this , electrical signals fire between neurons connected by ' axons ' - thread - like extensions of their outer surfaces which can be viewed as the ' wire ' in the electric circuit			0
when new signals fire repeatedly along axons , the connections between the neurons strengthen , making them easier to fire in the same pattern in future			0
neighbouring myelin - producing cells called oligodendrocytes ( ols ) recognise the repeating signal and wrap myelin around the active circuit wiring			1
it is this activity - driven insulation that the team identified as essential for learning			2
but while the study showed young adult mice need to make myelin to learn new motor skills , new myelin does not need to be produced to recall and perform a pre-learned skill			1
the theory was established when normal mice and mice which had their their ability to produce ols and myelin switched off were made to run on an irregular spaced wheel			2
the ' abnormal ' mice could not master the wheel			0
these discoveries could prove important in finding ways to stimulate and improve learning , and in understanding myelin 's involvement in other brain processes such as in cognition , the study published in @entity61 suggested			1
pictured is an electron micrograph of myelin sheath but when ' normal ' mice used the wheel but were then switched off , they could still master the wheel			0
professor @entity158 , director of the @entity159 , said : ' from earlier studies of human white matter using advanced @entity164 technology , we thought ols and myelin might be involved in some way in skill learning , so we decided to attack this idea experimentally			1
' we were surprised how quickly we saw differences in the ability of mice from each group to learn how to run on complex wheel , which shows just how fast the brain can respond to wrap newly - activated circuits in myelin and how this improves learning			1
' this rapid response suggests that a number of alternative axon pathways might already exist in the brain that could be used to drive a particular sequence of movements , but it quickly works out which of those circuits is most efficient and both selects and protects its chosen route with myelin			0
' we think these findings are really exciting as they open up opportunities to investigate the role of ols and myelin in other brain processes , such as cognitive activities like navigating through a maze , to see if the requirement for new myelin is general or specific to motor activity			0
' i 'm keen to find out the precise sequence of changes to ols and myelin during learning and whether these changes are needed more in some parts of the brain than others , which might shed light on some of the mysteries still surrounding how the brain adapts and learns throughout life			2
