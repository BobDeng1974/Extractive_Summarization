by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:56 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 18:56 est , 12 november 2012 a top @entity3 has warned that @entity4 must testify to the @entity5 about the terror attack in @entity7 - and he could be forced to do so by legal means			1
@entity9 insisted it was ' unacceptable ' that the former @entity12 director had not yet given @entity13 an account of a trip to @entity16 he made shortly before his resignation last week , and threatened to seek a subpoena to obtain it			1
@entity4 was due to discuss the @entity12 's role in the raid which killed the @entity22 ambassador and three other @entity22 before @entity13 on thursday			1
however , after he stepped down from the agency when it was revealed that he carried out an extra-marital affair with his married biographer , it was announced that his acting replacement , deputy director @entity29 , would testify instead			2
@entity9 , the senator for @entity43 who is chair of the @entity44 , told @entity45 that the decorated former general would have to give details about a fact - finding mission he apparently made to @entity7 a few weeks ago			1
' i believe that there is a trip report , ' she said			0
' we have to asked to see the trip report			0
one person tells me has read it			0
and then we try to get it , and they tell me it has n't been done			0
we are entitled to this trip report , and if we have to go to the floor of the @entity5 on a subpoena , we will do just that			0
' threat : @entity9 warned that the @entity44 could subpoena @entity4 however , despite the controversy over the timing of @entity4 ' resignation , just three days after the presidential election and less than a week before his scheduled testimony , the long - serving senator said she had no reason to think it was linked to the @entity7 scandal			1
but she added : ' the skin of the onion is getting peeled off			0
we do n't know what we may find			0
' suspicions over how much @entity31 knew about the @entity7 probe could complicate @entity4 ' testimony over the controversial issue			1
@entity31 , a married army veteran who met @entity4 in 2006 , was speaking at the @entity81 on october 26 when she was asked about the september 11 attack			1
' now i do n’t know if a lot of you heard this , but the @entity12 annex had actually - had taken a couple of @entity16 militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back , ' she said , according to the @entity95			1
' so that 's still being vetted			0
' in response , the @entity12 denied that claim on sunday when the tape of @entity31 's talk surfaced , saying that it was not true			1
the agency confirmed that since 2009 they have not had the authority to detain prisoners			0
' any suggestion that the @entity106 is still in the detention business is uninformed and baseless , ' they told the site			0
the only other news station to report that claim at the time that @entity31 made her speech to the @entity81 was @entity112 , which she references moments before making the claim about the alleged prisoners			1
according to the clearest timeline of @entity31 and @entity4 ' alleged affair , which is said to have started in 2011 and ended in ' early summer ' of this year , they would have been broken up for at least a few months by the time of this conference			1
she went on to defend both the government 's controversial reaction to the crisis and the @entity12 's lack of disclosure			2
disclosing possible secrets : at the @entity129 talk in october , @entity31 spoke about a theory that the embassy was holding a number of @entity16 prisoners at the time of the september 11 attack making the rounds : she spoke regularly about @entity4 in an effort to promote her book ' the challenging thing for @entity4 is that in his new position he is not allowed to communicate with the press			1
so he ’s known all of this , they had correspondence with the @entity12 station chief in @entity16			1
within 24 hours they kind of knew what was happening , ' she said			0
' if you remember at the time , the @entity156 video , the @entity157 video that came out , the demonstrations that were going on in @entity154 - there were demonstrations in 22 other countries at the time , tens of thousands of people and our government was very concerned that this was going to become a nightmare for us			0
' so you can understand if you put yourself in his shoes , or secretary @entity168 's shoes , or the president 's shoes , that we thought it was tied somehow to the demonstrations in @entity154			0
it 's true that we have signal intelligence that shows the militia members in @entity16 were watching the demonstrations in @entity154 and that did galvanize their efforts			2
' as a former intel officer , it ’s frustrating to me because it reveals our sources and methods			0
i do n’t think the public needs to know all of that			0
@entity31 has come under intense scrutiny ever since @entity4 , the four star general credited with the surge in @entity186 , submitted his resignation citing an extramarital affair			1
working benefits : @entity31 wrote that she learned a great deal by being mentored by @entity4 out : @entity4 resigned on friday november 9 citing an extramarital affair during the lengthy discussion , @entity31 's high aspirations are clear as she spoke repeatedly about how she has had the life - long goal of becoming the @entity196			1
when asked if she had the chance to talk to any previous @entity196 's , she said that she had not but she considers ' @entity198 ' and ' @entity199 ' to be great role models , referring to @entity201 and @entity199 by their nicknames			0
@entity31 's high achieving personality and her unusually comfortable nature around @entity4 raised concerns among @entity4 ' close advisers in the year leading up to the revelation of the affair			2
to those outside the general 's tight - knit circle , however , news of the affair came as a big surprise when it was announced on friday			0
@entity4 was expected to make headlines when he was made to testify in front of @entity13 about what and when the @entity12 knew regarding the timeline of events in @entity16 when a group of terrorists stormed the consulate killing ambassador @entity222 and three other @entity22			1
the affair was discovered by the @entity225 when they responded @entity226 , a @entity227 woman and friend of @entity4 who allegedly received email threats from @entity31			2
both @entity226 and @entity31 are married with children , but that did n't stop @entity31 from becoming defensive of @entity4			2
she supposedly told @entity226 to ' stay away from my man '			0
though there were multiple threatening emails , none of them were considered criminal so the @entity225 has not charged the army reservist			0
news of the affair ' was like a lightning bolt ' , said @entity243 senator @entity9 who heads the @entity44			2
@entity4 was scheduled to testify in front of @entity13 on thursday , but that has since been pushed back in light of his resignation			2
now his replacement , @entity12 deputy director @entity249 , will appear instead of @entity4			1
@entity9 went on to say that just because @entity4 no longer works at the @entity12 , that does prohibit @entity13 from compelling him to testify about @entity7 at a later date			1
watch @entity9 's interview watch @entity31 speaking			2

@entity9 threatens to subpoena former @entity12 director after he pulls out of appointment to give evidence about @entity7 attack
replacement will speak instead but @entity4 promises to testify in *future*
his alleged mistress @entity31 talked about @entity16 at *college* lecture
said there were @entity16 prisoners in @entity22 consulate at the time of the september 11 attack that left four dead *including* ambassador
