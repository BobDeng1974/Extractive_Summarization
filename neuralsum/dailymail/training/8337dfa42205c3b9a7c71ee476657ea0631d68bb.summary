the @entity1 handed its own staff £ 369million in severance payments over eight years , the spending watchdog revealed yesterday			1
mps said the massive sum showed an ‘ outrageous disregard for licence - fee payers ’ money ’			2
the @entity9 said the @entity1 often breached its own guidelines and had ‘ put public trust at risk ’ by authorising the payouts , including £ 61million to senior managers			1
out : payments to ten top managers , including former director general @entity17 ( pictured ) and chief operating officer @entity18 , totalled £ 4.9million some staff were even paid twice , pocketing a payoff after working out their notice period in full			1
the average individual payments to senior managers rose steadily to £ 191,000 last year , demonstrating the @entity1 had a ‘ fat cat mentality ’ , mps said			1
culture secretary @entity26 said the damning report revealed a ‘ culture of payoffs that simply can not be justified ’			1
as director general @entity38 admitted the @entity1 had ‘ lost its way over payments ’ , pressure mounted on its governing body , the @entity31 , to explain why it had failed to ‘ get a grip ’ despite years of disquiet over payoffs to senior staff			1
culture secretary @entity26 condemned ' a culture of pay - offs ' at the corporation which could not be justified @entity38 will appear before the influential @entity42 of @entity22 next week alongside @entity31 chairman @entity43 and former director general @entity44 , who authorised some of the most contentious deals			1
the @entity9 revealed : the @entity9 report also accused the @entity1 of failing to keep proper records to document why individual payoffs were approved as it emerged some deals were simply agreed by divisional directors following verbal discussions			2
@entity9 head @entity54 said : ‘ the @entity1 has too often breached its own already generous policies on severance payments			2
weak governance arrangements have led to payments that exceeded contractual requirements and put public trust at risk			1
’ in an effort to reduce costs , the @entity1 has cut its senior management by more than 20 per cent since 2005			2
but 67 per cent of those who left claimed severance payments			0
these came under three categories : redundancy payments , money given in lieu of notice in return for their swift departure , and ‘ discretionary ’ payments			0
shockingly , the @entity9 discovered cases of senior managers claiming money ‘ in lieu ’ despite having served their full notice periods , effectively paying them twice for the same period of work			1
one unnamed manager , who earned £ 300,000 , was given a full years ’ salary in lieu of notice despite continuing to work for 14 months after agreeing a departure date			0
the payment was personally approved by mr @entity44 , who also agreed to give the manager a pension ‘ augmentation ’ of £ 266,288			0
in 2005/6 , the average individual severance payment was £ 128,000			0
this rose steadily to £ 191,000 in the last financial year			0
two staff members were offered £ 425,000 in lieu of notice even though they had already secured jobs with other employers before leaving			0
other managers were given ‘ discretionary ’ severance payments , the reasons for which were ‘ not fully recorded ’ , the @entity9 found			2
one received £ 219,000 – £ 141,000 more than they were entitled to , including £ 49,000 for ‘ training and information technology equipment to improve the individual ’s skills and career prospects ’			1
another received an ‘ ex-gratia ’ payment of £ 17,600 , four months extra pay in lieu of notice worth £ 71,000 , plus a redundancy payment of £ 88,100			0
in a separate development , the @entity1 revealed that mr @entity17 , who resigned on november 10 in the wake of the @entity110 after 54 days as director general , received a total of £ 802,000 during his final year with the corporation			1
as the @entity31 set his last day of employment on november 30 , he was given an extra three weeks ’ salary worth £ 25,000 on top of a severance payment of £ 470,300 and a series of generous benefits including legal support and private healthcare			1
criticism : new director general @entity38 admitted the @entity1 had ' lost its way ' with big money pay - offs for senior staff the @entity1 also admitted that mr @entity17 and mr @entity44 had racked up almost £ 200,000 in ‘ legal and related costs ’ between them for their appearances before the @entity131 into how the @entity1 handled the @entity133 scandal			1
last night @entity135 mp @entity134 , who chairs the @entity42 , said : ‘ i expect [ the @entity31 ] will say these payments are not their responsibility			0
but they are there to protect the licence fee payers ’ interest and provide oversight			0
they should have got a grip on it			0
’ she added : ‘ the @entity1 have shown an outrageous disregard for licence fee payers ’ money			1
it seems there has been a fat cat mentality in the @entity1			0
’ mrs @entity26 said : ‘ the @entity9 has exposed a culture of payoffs that simply can not be justified			2
’ despite accepting its processes were ‘ not robust enough ’ , the @entity1 said it had saved more than £ 35million overall by reducing senior managers			1
@entity38 said : ‘ i accept in full the conclusions of the @entity9 report			0
the level of some of these payments was wrong – i said so in my first week in the job			0
i believe the @entity1 lost its way on payments in recent years			0
i have already said that we will be capping severance payments at £ 150,000 and we have now begun to improve our processes			2
’ last year 71 per cent of the @entity1 ’s £ 5billion income was funded by the £ 145.50 licence fee			1
the rest was made up by selling @entity1 programmes internationally through its commercial arm , @entity172			0
one former @entity1 executive was so shocked that his £ 376,000 severance payment was not properly authorised that yesterday he wrote a cheque to the @entity1 repaying it			1
@entity176 , who was the director of archive content , left last year after 29 years ’ service to become chief executive of the @entity180			1
even though he was not made redundant , he was offered a full years ’ salary of £ 250,000 , as well as some £ 125,000 in lieu of serving his notice period			0
the @entity9 said the decision to award it was ‘ seriously deficient ’ and found the @entity1 agreed to pay the money because it believed he would not otherwise have accepted his new job , which had a salary of £ 150,000			1
the 51 - year - old , who was previously controller of @entity191 and @entity192 , left as the corporation was making redundancies and the future of his role was uncertain			0
after being contacted by the @entity9 , mr @entity176 wrote a letter to the @entity1 including a cheque for the entire sum			2
explaining his decision to @entity1 director general @entity38 , he wrote : ‘ you will understand that as a matter of principle i would never wish to benefit from a payment that could not be demonstrated to have been fully and appropriately authorised			1
‘ this week i was concerned to receive from the @entity9 ... new evidence , of which i was not and could not have been aware , concerning the @entity1 ’s internal process for approval of the payment to me			2
‘ this evidence has led the @entity9 to observe that the process in this case was “ seriously deficient ”			0
i therefore enclose with this letter a cheque payable to the @entity1 , amounting to the full sum i received as severance payment after tax was deducted by the @entity1 at source			2
’ the @entity1 declined to comment .			0
