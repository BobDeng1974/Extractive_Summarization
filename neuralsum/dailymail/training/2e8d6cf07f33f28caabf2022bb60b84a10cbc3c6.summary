@entity0 knows all about the glory of winning the @entity2 , having scored in the famous 6 - 2 win for @entity4 in @entity5 in 2009 and played in the 5 - 0 a year later when @entity6 was humbled on his debut as a manager in the fixture			1
on saturday he welcomes a new team - mate to the ‘ greatest show on earth ’ : the high - wire artist @entity14 , capable of wowing the crowds , but also of falling from great heights as he did at the @entity17			1
‘ i do n’t care if he bites , ’ says @entity0 , speaking in @entity18 ahead of saturday ’s game			1
‘ i do n’t care if he ’s bitten before , ’ he says			1
‘ he knows it ’s not the correct way to behave but as a player he is in the top three or five strikers in the world so i am really happy to have him in my team			1
’ @entity0 knows @entity14 will bring a toughness that has at times been missing from @entity4 ’s make - up over the last two seasons			1
@entity4 's @entity0 ( centre ) jokes with @entity14 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) at training on friday @entity4 manager @entity36 ( pictured , behind ) confirmed @entity14 is set to make his competitive debut in 10 years of @entity38 has seen tensions rise during the clashes between @entity4 and @entity5 ‘ he is a different style of player for us			1
we have @entity44 and @entity45 and they are sweet players and you can enjoy watching them on the ball , it ’s easy on the eye			1
he fights and scraps for the ball and finally gets the goal			0
in training you see that ultra-competitive streak			0
you can kick him and he just never goes down			0
you pull his shirt and he still goes towards the goal			0
it ’s true that he had a reputation in @entity18 ( for diving ) but you fall once in the @entity62 and it sticks			2
i have found him to be a very fair player			0
’ @entity0 has spent plenty of time up close and personal with the new man as @entity4 are put through their paces by @entity36 , the coach who is also preparing for his first clasico , as a manager at least			1
@entity0 , the joker , was never going to let last summer ’s event pass without training - ground comment			1
‘ of course we have been teasing him a little bit			2
last week we had a defensive drill to practise dealing with crosses			0
he was the attacker and i had to defend against him and two or three times we were fighting to get to the ball first and i ’d say , “ do n’t bite me ”			2
’ those training drills have also reinforced just what a natural finisher @entity14 is			1
‘ in training it ’s unbelievable , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ he has got that instinct that means when there are two or three rebounds in the box , the ball will always end up at his feet and he ’ll score			0
’ @entity14 shared the @entity92 last season with @entity93 , @entity0 ’s former @entity94 team - mate whom he will face on saturday and against whom he usually fares well			1
@entity0 admits that good record is in part owed to what were brilliant team performances as @entity4 reached near perfection under their greatest ever coach			1
@entity14 has said biting is ' like an impulse ' and that ' everyone has different ways of defending themselves ' ‘ in the first three or four years with @entity106 i think we played the best football i can remember			1
and we took that into the games against @entity5 , ’ @entity0 says			2
‘ in the last two or three years it has been a little bit more difficult for us but now we have changed the mentality with @entity36 and we are pressing very high again and @entity14 will definitely help that			1
’ to what extent the @entity115 can help power @entity4 ’s rediscovered high intensity after four months out will be tested on saturday			1
‘ in those first few training sessions you could see that he needed to train because he was dead after 10 minutes of work , ’ admits @entity0			1
‘ i would turn around and look at him and say , “ what happened to you , man ? ” but after two or three weeks he started to improve and now , as he showed against @entity127 in the last friendly for @entity129 , he is in good condition			0
’ the spotlight will also be on @entity132 on saturday			0
he has been left out at times this season — something that has never happened since the days of waiting in vain for @entity136 or @entity137 to pick up an injury or suspension at @entity94			0
the striker is set to make his competitive debut against @entity5 on saturday night after a four - month ban the @entity115 has also said that he is in now on the ' right path ' after seeking help for his impulses to bite @entity0 was a world champion with @entity146 and a @entity148 champion with @entity4 aged just 23			1
‘ it ’s been a strange career having hit such incredible heights so soon			2
it ’s not a strange career , it ’s a very good career , ’ he says			0
‘ and now here at @entity4 , it is the first time that i am not playing as much as i want to			1
it ’s a big challenge			0
’ in 10 years of clasicos he has seen tensions rise during the clashes between @entity106 and @entity6 , and fall since their departure			0
‘ to be fair i really kind of enjoyed it , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ it is true that maybe sometimes they crossed the line			0
and we crossed the line , too			0
it is just a game			0
but it is fine if you know how to control your emotions and everything on the pitch stays on the pitch and after the game you still have the same friendships			0
’ it somewhat underlines his point that former @entity5 player @entity178 now plays for @entity106 and former @entity4 team - mate @entity179 now plays for @entity6			2
one day you say you hate someone and the next day you ’re playing for them , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ we have a career and we always have to try to make the best of it			0
@entity179 loves @entity186 and so he went to @entity187 and @entity6 was there and @entity6 likes him so he said , “ ok , i will play there ”			0
’ @entity0 almost says that @entity179 loves @entity6 too but the old allegiances seem to prevent him getting the whole sentence out			2
well , i do n’t know if he loves @entity6 but i think he does because he ’s putting him in the team all the time and here at @entity4 it was more difficult for him , ’ he says			1
‘ you can see after two or three months there that he made the right decision			0
’ would @entity0 follow @entity179 back to the @entity62 if @entity94 came calling ? ‘ i left a lot of friends at @entity94 and i was really happy there even though i did not play as much as i wanted to , ’ he says			1
‘ but i always said that i want to retire here and if it is possible i want to stay here all my career			0
at this moment i am not thinking about leaving			0
i am really happy if it is true that @entity94 want me but i want to stay			0
i have been a @entity4 fan since i was a kid and all i want to do is to have success here			2
’ @entity0 ( right ) has been sidelined on occasion this season — something of a rarity for the @entity4 defender on the pitch he still believes he can reach the heights of four years ago and away from football he is thriving at the head of the small company @entity219 that has recently extended its golden manager online football game to mobile platforms			1
the game is popular with his own team - mates and involves each player picking his own team — which begs the obvious question : who ’s in your forward line , @entity230 ? ‘ @entity231 and @entity93 for sure , ’ he says			2
‘ and i had ( @entity233 ) @entity232 before but now			0
now it would have to be @entity14			2
’ l @entity235 is showing more of the games that matter in an unrivalled schedule of football , including @entity2 and @entity94 v @entity187 this weekend			0
play @entity0 's @entity239 at @entity240			2

@entity0 on @entity14 : ‘ i do n’t care if he ’s bitten before '
‘ he knows it ’s not the correct way to behave , ' said defender
@entity4 star says @entity14 is a different style to ' sweet ' @entity44 and @entity45
