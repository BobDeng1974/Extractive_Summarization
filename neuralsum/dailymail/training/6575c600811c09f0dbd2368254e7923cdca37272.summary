by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:02 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 02:46 est , 4 september 2012 @entity2 was facing disciplinary action last night over his extraordinary outburst after his defeat by a fellow blade runner			1
in one of the biggest upsets of @entity9 , @entity2 , who had not been beaten over 200m for seven years , was defeated in a thrilling finish by @entity13 @entity12			1
@entity12 ’s time was 21.25 seconds – slower than the world record @entity2 had set in the heats 24 hours earlier			1
@entity2 claimed his rival had an unfair advantage but after the race , the 25 - year - old @entity25 launched a tirade against his rival , accusing him of using blades that gave him an unfair advantage			1
@entity2 , the most famous paralympian in the world , declared : ‘ we are not running in a fair race here , absolutely ridiculous			2
the guy ’s legs are unbelievably long			0
‘ not taking away from @entity12 ’s performance , he ’s a great athlete , but these guys are a lot taller and you ca n’t compete ( with the ) stride length			1
’ @entity2 has twice previously complained about the rules on running blades to the @entity50 , ( @entity50 ) the governing body			2
officials said they would sit down with @entity2 in the next few days in a ‘ non emotional environment ’ to discuss his concerns and admitted the rules over the use of blades would be reviewed as technology progresses			2
close finish : silver medalist @entity2 and 200m winner @entity12 appeared to put the controversy behind them as they hugged at today 's medal ceremony yesterday @entity2 , who could face a £ 5,000 fine for his outburst , attempted to calm the outcry by apologising for the timing of his comments , both in writing and personally to the 20 - year - old			1
he also applauded the @entity13 as the pair received their medals in front of 80,000 spectators in the @entity75 , before giving each other a hug			1
but despite the mounting criticism , @entity2 did not change his sentiments			2
‘ that was @entity12 ’s moment and i would like to put on record the respect i have for him , ’ he said			0
‘ i want to apologise for the timing of my comments			0
’ he added : ‘ i do believe that there is an issue here and i welcome the opportunity to discuss it with the @entity50 but i accept that raising these concerns immediately as i stepped off the track was wrong			0
‘ i am a proud paralympian and believe in the fairness of sport			0
i am happy to work with the @entity50 who obviously share these aims			0
’ close contest : race winner @entity12 ( left ) wore longer prosthetic blades than @entity2 ( right ) , giving him a greater stride length disappointment : @entity25 's @entity2 looks dejected after finishing second in the race upset : @entity13 's @entity12 ( left ) celebrates in front of @entity25 's @entity2 ( right ) after claiming a shock victory in the 200m race ironically , @entity2 had faced similar opposition from those who claimed he should not be allowed to compete against able - bodied athletes as he did last month in the @entity104 – because his blades could give him an advantage			1
experts are still divided on whether blades provide an advantage for runners and there are rules governing the length of the blades that athletes can wear in proportion to their height			0
the @entity50 ’s @entity118 said that the length of the blades used by all eight athletes on sunday night had been measured and fully complied with the rules			2
mr @entity118 revealed that @entity2 had telephoned him personally to express concerns over the length of a rival athlete ’s blades six weeks ago although the athlete in question was not @entity12			1
triumphant : @entity12 embarks on a victory lap after winning gold at the @entity130 handshake : @entity2 congratulated @entity12 on his gold - winning performance , but claimed that athletes with longer blades had an unfair advantage the restrictions on blade lengths are worked out by taking two measurements from an athlete ’s body and then putting them into a formula that illustrates what that person ’s height would be if they were not disabled			1
what had so amazed @entity2 was that @entity12 was losing by eight metres in the home straight but was able to run him down			2
stunned by the weight of criticism , @entity12 said he was sad because @entity2 was his ‘ idol ’ and he said he believed he had known his blades passed all the accepted tests			1
‘ he is not a bad loser , ’ @entity12 insisted			0
‘ he is a great athlete			0
i am just sad with the interview where he said my blades were too big			0
' he was bothered by my time in the semi-finals and he wanted to get me with his polemic but it did not work			0
for me he is a really great idol and to hear that from a great idol is difficult			0
’ @entity161 to head : @entity12 's longer blades made him taller than @entity2 , which the @entity25 said gave him an advantage in the race video : @entity50 representatives @entity118 and @entity168 on the issue			1

@entity25 athlete came second in the @entity173 event as 80,000 spectators in the @entity75 watched in stunned silence
@entity2 claims @entity13 champion @entity12 had longer prosthetic blades that gave him greater stride length
apologises for timing of his bitter *post-race* outburst but wo *n't* back down over accusations
race *analysis* *suggests* superior leg speed rather than stride length was *key* to upset
@entity2 had complained twice this *summer* about *unnamed* athlete using unfair blades , official reveals
race and *subsequent* *row* brought best sunday ratings for @entity195 in seven years
