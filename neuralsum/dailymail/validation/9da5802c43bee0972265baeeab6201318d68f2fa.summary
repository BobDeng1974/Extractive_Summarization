playwright @entity0 , who has said that @entity1 is a nation of hypocrites and that @entity1 are ' better than all the rest ' at setting double standards we are a nation famed the world over for conquest , industry – and of course a good cup of tea			1

in each edition , the participants are asked to nominate what they believe to be one of @entity27 ’s world - class achievements			2
mr @entity0 , 80 , said he toyed with the idea of suggesting the @entity29 , medieval churches or the impressive landscape of @entity32			2
but in an interview with @entity34 , to be broadcast today , he says he believes that what the @entity1 are ‘ better than all the rest ’ at is setting double standards			1
he said : ‘ in @entity1 , what we do best is lip service			1
take @entity41 ; we extol its beauty and its dignity while at the same time we ’re happy to sell it off to the highest bidder			0
we glory in @entity48 yet we close our public libraries			0
‘ a substantial minority of our children receive a better education than the rest because of the social situation of the parents			2
‘ then we wonder why things at the top do not change or society improve			0
it ’s because we are hypocrites			0
’ he went on to claim that too often , the @entity1 are lazy in their assumptions that problems which affect other countries do not exist in their own , saying : ‘ our policemen are wonderful , provided you ’re white and middle class and do n’t take to the streets			1
‘ and dying in custody is what happens in @entity71			0
it does n’t happen here			0
’ he added : ‘ a memorable phrase in @entity74 , and one of the few that has n’t been picked up as a quotation or a title for something else , is when @entity81 is arranging for @entity74 to be arrested and executed when he gets to our shores			2
as part of his explanation , the writer says that policeman in @entity1 are wonderful , ' provided you 're white and middle class and do n't take to the streets ' ( file picture ) and in his letter he says ; “ do it @entity1 ”			1
