new research has found that more than half of @entity2 's most popular rice products - including @entity3 and @entity4 by @entity5 - exceed proposed new @entity7 limits for arsenic			1
while there are low levels of arsenic in most food and water , researchers are now concerned that arsenic can reach much higher levels in rice			1
@entity19 's dispatches , @entity4 : how @entity20 is our food ? which will be broadcast on monday night , tested 81 different products with the @entity24 at @entity25			0
tests have shown 58 per cent of rice products have exceeded proposed @entity7 recommended limits for arsenic in children 's products , which are expected to come into force next summer they discovered 58 per cent exceeded proposed @entity7 recommended limits for children , which are expected to come into force next summer			1
although there are strict limits for the amount of arsenic level allowed in water , there are currently no maximum levels in food - and now some scientists are speaking out as they are concerned about the effects of long - term exposure			1
as more evidence emerges about the harm high levels of arsenic might cause , particularly to children , new maximum levels have been proposed by the @entity7 with the support of the @entity55			1
the proposed new @entity7 recommendations will limit 200 parts of arsenic per billion for adults and just 100 ppb for children and babies			2
during the research products including @entity3 and @entity64 organic puffed rice cereal were tested multiple times - and some showed high levels of inorganic arsenic , far above the proposed limits			1
organic original puffed rice cereal by @entity70 was found to have 323 parts of arsenic per billion ( ppb ) while organic wholegrain baby rice by @entity74 was found to have 268 ppb – 168 per cent above recommended levels for babies and children			1
@entity3 by @entity77 were found to have 188 ppb , far above the recommended levels for babies and children			1
baby organic rice cakes by @entity79 were found to be 162 ppb , and organic wholegrain banana porridge by @entity74 at 142 ppb			2
these graphs show how much inorganic arsenic the rice products have in them by % above the proposed limits the graphs show that of these eight products which were tested , the highest levels of inorganic arsenic are found in @entity89 and @entity90 with @entity91 @entity4 by @entity5 was found to be 129 ppb – 28.9 per cent above recommended levels for babies and children under the proposed new @entity7 rules manufacturers may have to reformulate their recipes or risk having to remove them from shops			1
while not harmful in small quantities to humans , scientists say exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic over a prolonged period can lead to cancer or heart disease			1
professor @entity106 , professor of biological sciences at @entity25 , told dispatches : ' the @entity7 is going to set standards for arsenic levels in baby rice at 100 parts per billion			2
to my estimation that is far too high			0
it should be at least half that			0
' the limits are set so as not to disrupt the rice trade rather than on the risk to human health			2
' people in @entity2 consume five times the amount of rice they did 40 years ago			1
while it is rich in vitamins , fibre and protein , it is also the only common food item with high levels of arsenic			1
the levels of arsenic in rice vary by type			2
@entity136 brown rice has 160ppb , red rice from @entity139 310ppb and basmati rice from @entity141 has just 40ppb			0
dr @entity142 of the @entity55 told the @entity19 programme : ' the risks are related to long - term exposure to arsenic			0
we are taking action to reduce that exposure			0
' she added : ' parents should not worry			0
there are no immediate risks			0
' the @entity154 , which represents the rice industry in the @entity2 said it ' welcomes ' the initiative to establish new arsenic limits in rice			1
a spokesman said : ' we can be confident there is no health risk associated with regular consumption of rice purchased in the @entity2			2
' boots , @entity74 and @entity77 told dispatches they take the safety of their products seriously			0
boots said they will continue to work closely with suppliers and regulatory experts to ensure their baby food is safe and fully complies with any future regulations			0
@entity173 told the programme they test their foods rigorously and parents should have no cause for concern , and added : ‘ we welcome proposals for further regulation and we would meet future legislative changes			0
’ @entity3 's said their cereals are not in the category of foods for infants and young children , and said it 's a complex issue and a number of proposed limits are on the table			0
a @entity77 spokesman said : ' the testing we have done shows that the levels are within the limits of the most up to date proposals we have seen			0
we will continue to work with government agencies , scientists , academics and others in the food industry at a global level to review the data on this topic			0

experts warn some popular rice products contain high levels of arsenic
tests found 58 % exceeded new recommended arsenic limits for children
scientists say high levels over time could lead to cancer or heart disease
people in @entity2 consume five times more rice today than 40 years ago
