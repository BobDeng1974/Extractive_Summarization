by @entity0 swimming legend @entity2 faces losing the use of his left arm after developing an infection in hospital , friends fear			1
the five - time olympic gold medallist – who has battled depression – requires round - the - clock medical care after picking up the bug following a shoulder operation			1
it has reportedly become so bad that close friends are concerned he will no longer be able to use his left arm – denying his admirers the chance to ever see him in the pool again			1
the 31 - year - old @entity19 had undergone surgery for a shoulder injury near his home in the @entity25 town of @entity26 , according to @entity29 ’s @entity28 television network			1
it is not clear exactly where he picked up the infection			2
last night , his manager @entity43 said his condition was ‘ serious but not life - threatening ’			0
he added that @entity2 may not swim competitively again			1
the troubled star ’s latest crisis comes after he was admitted to rehab in february , suffering from depression			1
in recent years , his life appeared to be in turmoil , with questions about his sexuality – he has denied rumours that he is gay – and claims he used performance - enhancing drugs			0
before the @entity57 , the head coach of the @entity56 team accused him of cheating , insisting his physical attributes were symptomatic of steroid use			0
surgery complications : a report in @entity29 's media claims that the swimmer contracted a ' bug ' after surgery that threatens the use of his left arm a hospital - acquired infection usually first appears three days after admission to a hospital or other health care facility			1
the infection , which can be caused by viruses , bacteria , fungi or parasites , may develop from surgical procedures , catheters in the urinary tract or blood vessels or from material in the air which is inhaled into the lungs			2
these micro-organisms may already be present in the patient 's body or come from the environment , contaminated hospital equipment , healthcare workers or other patients			0
common hospital infections are @entity93 and @entity94			0
sometimes the infection can have devastating results and require a limb to be amputated , if the infection can not be treated			1
some of the common causes of infections are when the hospital : fails to carry out routine pre-screening for @entity93 or @entity94 prior to surgery ; delays in identifying and treating the infection when it has been acquired ; fails to treat or monitor the infection appropriately , to provide basic medical care and post-surgical treatment or a clean and safe environment			1
this was followed seven years later by claims in a @entity113 newspaper that he showed abnormal levels of two banned substances in a doping test			0
but the freestyle specialist was cleared of suspicion when the @entity119 dismissed any suggestion of wrongdoing			0
@entity2 made an ill - fated attempt to compete at the @entity123 , struggling in the trials			1
he told reporters afterwards : ‘ the fairytale has turned into a nightmare			0
’ @entity2 ’s manager , @entity43 , told the @entity129 in february : ‘ he made the decision [ last year ] that he would give up competitive swimming			1
there is plenty of things to do in life after swimming			0
he loves cooking , travel , and is a natural for television			0
‘ [ he needs to find something that will ] give him the same type of satisfaction [ as swimming ]			0
‘ there would n’t be an @entity19 who is living today who has n’t got the pride and joy of seeing @entity2 swimming and winning gold medals , and who would n’t wish him well , ’ mr @entity43 added			1
the nightmare continued away from the pool			0
in his 2013 autobiography , @entity155 , he confessed he had battled ‘ crippling depression ’ for more than a decade			0
he told how he had considered suicide and had been drinking huge quantities of alcohol to deal with his pain			0
yet he was determined to continue swimming and hoped to be picked for @entity19 ’s @entity164 team to compete in @entity165 this year			2
but then came the shoulder injury and he had to concede his career was over			2
in february , he sought help after being found outside his parents ’ home in @entity29 , disoriented from a combination of antidepressants and medication for the shoulder complaint			1
now the man whose power left the competition behind in the pool faces one of his biggest challenges – recovering from the infection that has left his friends so worried			2
breaking his silence : @entity2 has taken to @entity184 to congratulate @entity185 for her silver medal at the @entity187 @entity2 celebrated winning gold in the 200m freestyle at the @entity190			2

@entity2 is in intensive care in @entity29 being treated for an infection
his associates fear he may lose the use of his left arm
