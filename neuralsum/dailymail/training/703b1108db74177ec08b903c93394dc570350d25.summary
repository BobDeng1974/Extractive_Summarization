by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 14:47 est , 11 december 2012 an international study has revealed that students in @entity4 schools perform better than the global average , but still lag behind many of their peers in @entity8 and @entity9			1
fourth - graders have improved their scores in reading and math over the past four years , according to a study released tuesday			1
but progress seems to fall off by eighth grade , where math and science scores are stagnant			2
meanwhile , kids in countries like @entity21 and @entity22 are outperforming @entity4 fourth - graders in science and reading			1
lagging behind : @entity25 is leading in fourth - grade reading , with the @entity4 in sixth place , while @entity22 is no 1 in fourth - grade math , 10 spots ahead of the @entity4 by eighth grade , @entity4 students have fallen behind their @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 counterparts in math , and trail students from @entity25 , @entity38 and @entity39 in science			1
‘ these 2011 international assessments provide both encouraging news about our students ' progress and some sobering cautionary notes , ’ said education secretary @entity42 , who applauded gains among fourth - graders but warned those gains are n't being sustained in later grades			1
‘ that is unacceptable if our schools are to live up to the @entity4 promise of giving all children a world - class education			2
’ the results of the study , conducted every four years in nations around the world , show mixed prospects for delivering on that promise			0
a nation that once took pride in being at the top of its game can no longer credibly call itself the global leader in student performance			0
wringing their hands about what that reality portends for broader @entity4 influence , policymakers worry it could have ripple effects on the economy down the line , with @entity4 increasingly at a competitive disadvantage in the international marketplace			0
numbers game : @entity4 eighth - graders are behind their @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 peers , with @entity39 and @entity22 in the forefront elevating the skills needed to compete with emerging countries has been a priority for president @entity88 , who has pledged to train 100,000 new math and science teachers over the next decade			1
‘ think about the @entity4 within our reach : a country that leads the world in educating its people			0
an @entity4 that attracts a new generation of high - tech manufacturing and high - paying jobs , ’ he said this year in his @entity92 address			0
the @entity4 has a long way to go to reach those goals			0
in the meantime , other countries are making significant strides			0
@entity33 eighth - graders were about tied in math with their @entity4 peers in 2007 , the last time the study was conducted			1
four years later , @entity33 's scores have surged and now surpass the @entity4 by a significant margin			0
@entity114 skills are a major strength for @entity4 students			2
only a few points separate @entity4 students from the top - scoring students in the world			2
in @entity121 , which took part in the study separately , reading scores are second only to @entity25			0
@entity8 continues to dominate the top echelon of scores across subject fields			0
the tiny city - state of @entity22 takes first place in eighth - grade science and fourth - grade math , with @entity39 scoring nearly as high			1
@entity22 takes second place to @entity39 in eighth - grade math , with @entity35 in third			1
under the microscope : @entity22 takes first place in eighth - grade science , while @entity4 is only in the 10th spot @entity138 marks : eighth - graders in @entity140 and @entity141 score far better in math and science than the @entity4 average the results also lean toward @entity8 nations when it comes to advanced levels of learning			1
in @entity22 , four in 10 eighth - graders achieved the ‘ advanced benchmark ’ in science , which requires an understanding of complex and abstract concepts in physics , chemistry , biology and other sciences			1
about two in 10 make the grade in @entity34 , @entity39 and @entity35			2
in the @entity4 , it 's about one in 10			0
‘ there are a small handful of countries or systems that are managing to get a much larger percentage of their students over the advanced benchmark , ’ said @entity163 , commissioner of the @entity164			2
‘ there 's clearly some room for improvement			0
’ unimpressive : one one in 10 @entity4 eighth - graders achieved the ' advanced benchmark ' in science , compared to four in 10 in @entity22 the @entity179 and its sister test , the @entity178 , are used to measure knowledge , skills and mastery of curricula by elementary and middle school students around the world			1
students in rich , industrialized nations and poor , developing countries alike are tested			0
in 2011 , 56 educational systems — mostly countries , but some states and subnational entities like @entity25 — took part in math and science exams			2
fifty - three systems participated in the reading exam , which included almost 13,000 @entity4 fourth - graders			1
‘ these kinds of tests are very good at telling us who 's ahead in the race			0
they do n't have a lot to say about causes or why countries are where they are , ’ said @entity201 senior fellow @entity200 , who in previous years represented the @entity4 in the international group that administers the test			0
some @entity4 states that were measured separately were clear standouts , performing on par with or better than some top - performing @entity8 countries			2
eighth - graders in @entity140 and @entity141 score far better in math and science than the @entity4 average			1
but in @entity223 and @entity224 , eighth - graders fell short of the national average			2
racial and class disparities are all too real			0
in eighth grade , @entity4 in the schools with the highest poverty — those with 75 per cent or more of students on free or reduced - price lunch — performed below both the @entity4 average and the lower international average			1
silver lining : only a few points separate @entity4 students from the top - scoring students in the world when it comes to reading gender gap : boys do better than girls in fourth - grade science and eighth - grade math , but girls lead in reading students at schools with fewer poor kids performed better			1
in fourth - grade reading , all ethnic groups outperformed the international average , but white and @entity8 students did better than their black and @entity256 classmates			1
boys in the @entity4 do better than girls in fourth - grade science and eighth - grade math. but girls rule when it comes to reading			1
on a global level , the gender gap appears to be closing			0
about half of the countries showed no statistically meaningful gap between boys and girls in math and science			2
the tests are carried out by the @entity271 , a coalition of research institutions			0
the @entity4 portion of the exams is coordinated by the @entity275 's @entity164 .			0

@entity25 is leading in fourth - grade reading , with the @entity4 in sixth place
@entity22 is no 1 in fourth - grade math , while the @entity4 is in the 11th spot on the list
@entity4 eighth - graders are in ninth and 10th place respectively in math and science , with @entity39 and @entity22 in top spots
only one in 10 @entity4 students has achieved ' advanced benchmark ' in science , compared to four in 10 in @entity22
eighth - graders in @entity140 and @entity141 score far better in math and science than the @entity4 average
eighth - graders in schools with the highest poverty performed below both the @entity4 and global average
boys in the @entity4 do better than girls in fourth - grade science and eighth - grade math , but girls lead in reading
