a federal judge has slammed @entity1 for refusing to delay demolition of a soldier 's home while he trained in @entity5 for deployment to the @entity7			1
the soldier 's kids and pregnant wife were kicked to the curb and the house was razed in 2011 after @entity14 staff sergeant @entity13 did not heed numerous county requests to fix building code violations			1
@entity13 had repeatedly asked for extensions to fix the problems while he training or on a mission			2
at one point his commanding military officer also weighed in , asking to officials to stay the hearing 90 days while @entity13 was conducting training on how to defuse improvised explosive devices in @entity26			2
homeless : @entity13 , his wife , @entity29 , and their newborn son in 2011 after their house was demolished before @entity13 deployed to @entity34 for the second time demolished : the couple 's home was razed for code violations and @entity13 's wife did n't even have time to take out all their belongings the family was able to save soem of their belongings , but much of what they owned was lost -- including a piano -- when the home was demolished			1
' they did n't care , ' 32 - year - old @entity49 told the @entity51			0
@entity53 judge @entity52 sided with the father of four , last week , scheduling a september trial to decide what the county owes @entity13			1
but he urged both sides to first attempt a settlement			0
at issue is a @entity62 - era law , reinstated in 2003 , that allows for the temporary suspension of legal or administrative proceedings that could affect active duty military members ' civil rights			0
' while it is possible that the @entity68 employed dilatory tactics to avoid remedying the violations on their property and complying with the applicable building ordinances , ' @entity52 wrote , ' their behavior does not negate the ( county 's ) failure to stay the proceedings ...			1
' the county argued that @entity13 was in the @entity77 when it issued the violations			1
but @entity52 ruled that since @entity13 was on active duty when he requested the stay , he should have been protected			1
before : the county complained the @entity13 home had a deteriorated roof and porch beams and @entity13 asked for more time to fix it , but to no avail @entity88 ? the county placed this notice on the home two months before they razed it county officials declined to discuss the case with the @entity51 , citing the ongoing litigation			1
but in court filings , @entity1 representatives said they 'd given @entity13 more than enough time to fix the violations between deployments			1
the family rented seven rooms in two houses without permission			0
among the problems with their home that sparked the initial code enforcement citations : deteriorating porch beams and a deteriorated roof , as well as a damaged door and an uncovered electrical junction box			0
@entity13 says he tried to fix the initial problems but did n't have the money to take out the necessary construction permits			2
then he was sent to a @entity117 training base and was fined for failing to complete the work			0
meanwhile , inspectors reviewed the house more closely and ordered more improvements , including covering exposed wiring and other hazards			0
after more failed negotiations over the home , the family 's power was shut off			0
eventually , @entity13 hired an engineer and an architect to make the necessary changes , but the county said the problems were so extensive it would be better to start from scratch			2
@entity13 says the county targeted his family while ignoring other similar houses in the neighborhood			2
his attorney wants the city to drop all liens , suspend code - enforcement activities and pay $ 395,000 in 20 days			0
in exchange , the family would agree to sell the property where the house was demolished , as well as two other neighboring homes they own			0
fighting back : this sign now stands in place of the home , blasting the county for demolishing it			0
