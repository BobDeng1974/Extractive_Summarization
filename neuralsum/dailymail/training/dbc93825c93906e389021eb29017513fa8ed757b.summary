he got very publicly naked in @entity1 and was last seen twerking on a yacht in @entity3			1
so it might be thought that prince @entity5 has very few secrets left to reveal			1
but the fourth in line to the throne admitted today that he still gets ridiculously nervous when asked to speak publicly			0
@entity5 , 30 , was confessing all in his role as founder of @entity12 , the charity he set up in 2006 to help children afflicted by @entity15 in the poverty - stricken @entity17 kingdom of @entity18			1
in his video clip , which can be viewed online , the royal says : ' on today , @entity28 , my secret is , believe it or not , i get incredibly nervous before public speaking , no matter how big the crowd or the audience			1
' despite the fact that i laugh and joke all the time , i get incredibly nervous , if not anxious , actually , before going into rooms full of people when i am wearing a suit			0
‘ and now i have confessed that i ’ll probably be even more worried that people are looking at me			0
‘ the prince ’s secret , while not exactly revelatory , is surprising as he has become an increasingly assured speaker with a developing public role in recent years			2
over the summer he launched the inspiring @entity54 for injured servicemen as with a moving speech in front of thousands and ad - libbed to a sell - out crowd in the @entity61 at a closing concert			0
no fear : despite @entity5 's claims , he has proved an assured public speaker - notably at the @entity54 campaign : @entity5 's revelations came as part of a social media campaign for his charity @entity12 celebrities supporting the initiative included @entity75 , who said : ‘ my secret is sometimes i do n’t feel like i ’m enough , i ’m worth it and i do n’t fit in but # feelnoshame			1
’ boxer @entity77 said ; ‘ my secret is a big embarrassing in that when i was one years of age my next door neighbour ’s cat had just take it upon itself to scratch me down my face and taken near enough half my skin off			0
‘ ever since that day i have been scared of cats and whenever one comes across my path now i ’m petrified of them			0
i know it ’s a bit strange a secret like that coming from a world champion but i am absolutely scared and terrified of cats			0
’ singer @entity94 also admitted – rather too candidly , perhaps : ‘ when i was 11 i drank rather too much tea when i was out with my mum and then i went into @entity97 [ the chemist ] and weed myself			0
' now , today , i can not stop at a service station , at a petrol station , without going to the loo even though i do n’t need the loo			0
it ’s ingrained in my brain , i know it wo n’t happen again but i feel no shame			0
’ @entity17 : @entity12 's work focuses on helping those with @entity15 and @entity15 in the tiny country of @entity18 stigma : the new campaign aims to encourage sufferers to speak up and get the help they need on a different tack , actress @entity116 admitted she had never seen @entity118			1
the campaign , which was created by charity @entity12 – which prince @entity5 co-founded – aims to raise awareness of how eradicating this shame and stigma can save the lives of @entity15 sufferers , empowering them to seek medical support and education about their condition , and preventing the virus from spreading			1
in a video released to mark the start of the initiative , the prince said : ‘ globally , @entity15 is the second highest cause of death amongst those aged between 10 - 19 years old , and it is the number one cause of death across @entity17			1
' one tragic issue in particular is the shame and stigma linked to @entity15			1
this causes thousands of children to needlessly die each year because they ’re keeping their illness a secret and not getting the medical attention they need			0
‘ to show our support for the children of @entity18 [ where @entity12 works ] , and help reduce the stigma for all those affected by @entity15 , we are turning this @entity28 into a day in which no one should feel any shame about their secrets			1
' together , we can tackle the stigma surrounding @entity15 and give the young people carrying it the childhood they deserve			1
the childhood so many of us take for granted			0
’ secret : @entity94 also revealed her deepest secret - that she once wet herself in @entity97 aged 11 revelations : @entity116 has never seen @entity118 while @entity77 was once scratched by a cat @entity166 , ceo of @entity167 , said : ‘ this @entity167 is launching an important campaign			2
too many children are not receiving the treatment and care they so desperately need due to the stigma attached to @entity15			1
' today we will celebrate the sharing of secrets with # @entity25 , to help spread the word that eradicating the stigma surrounding @entity15 will help save the lives of many hiv - positive children			1
’ prince @entity5 co-founded @entity167 in 2006 with prince @entity179 , following a visit to the country two years earlier , when he was struck by the effect the hiv / aids pandemic was having on the country , particularly its children			2
@entity18 has the third highest @entity187 in the world			0
more than 37,000 of @entity18 ’s 500,000 children are @entity15 positive , and approximately 200,000 have lost parents to @entity15 , forcing them out of school and into hazardous forms of labour including prostitution and trafficking			2
since 1996 , the country ’s average life expectancy has fallen from 59 years to below 48.7 years			0
@entity167 provides accommodation , hot food , access to medication and education for @entity18 ’s children – preventing the virus from spreading – as well as vital psycho - social support to help them tackle stigma and cope with the emotional repercussions of their condition and live normal lives			2
it also encourages children and young people to come together through week - long @entity215 camps and regular clubs , to talk about their health issues and fears of living with @entity15			2
often for the first time they learn to talk openly to one another about being @entity15 - positive , learning about their medication , building friendships and a sense of normality , as they realise that , with the correct medication , it is possible to lead a long and healthy life .			2

@entity5 admitted to his fear of public speaking in @entity15 video campaign
