frustration was clear in the voices of @entity2 and @entity3 as they fended off repeated enquiries about @entity7 's future more than a year after he had seemingly been banished from international cricket for good			2
well , there is only one person to blame — and that is @entity12			0
the incoming @entity14 chairman has been responsible for the mixed messages that leave the @entity17 team in as big a state of turmoil and internal rebellion as ever			1
@entity12 has forged an excellent reputation in @entity23 cricket as chairman of @entity25 for the way he bankrolled and transformed the club , but his initial forays into the international game have been little short of an embarrassment			2
@entity12 has made a habit of talking before thinking since being announced as @entity14 chairman he has become the loose cannon of @entity23 cricket — and he has yet to take up office			1
it all started on march 1 when he gave an interview to @entity38 of the @entity39 , who is known for his persistence and admirable success in coaxing ear - catching sound bites from interviewees			0
so when @entity12 said that @entity7 — exiled for valid reasons after the last @entity47 debacle before producing a nasty autobiography that only supported the @entity14 's decision — had to be playing county cricket to earn an @entity17 recall , it was put down to @entity25 straight - talking			1
yet subsequently , most importantly in a phone conversation with @entity7 , @entity12 has done little to play down the 34 - year - old 's chances — even if privately the chairman is said to be perplexed at the media 's ' spin ' on his apparent opening of the @entity17 door			1
if @entity12 , who has apparently assured senior figures that he does not want @entity7 back , really had no intention of encouraging the maverick , then he has made a right old mess of it			2
for he has created a soap opera that will run and run now @entity7 has rejoined @entity66 and put huge pressure on a fledgling @entity17 middle order who made significant @entity71 progress last summer			2
@entity17 head coach @entity2 ( left ) and @entity3 answer questions at a press conference not to mention completely undermining managing director @entity74 and national selector @entity75 , who have repeatedly clarified @entity17 's stance on the batsman over the last 14 months			0
and if @entity12 disagreed with the original decision to axe @entity7 , then he had a duty as deputy chairman of the @entity14 to say so then , not wait until he had taken over from @entity81			1
since his @entity7 outburst , @entity12 has said that there will be an inquiry if @entity17 do not beat a ' mediocre ' @entity87 in the upcoming three - @entity71 series			1
this prompted the respected @entity91 commentator @entity90 to liken the comments to @entity94 's infamous intention in 1976 to make the @entity87 ' grovel '			0
then @entity12 came out with the ridiculous notion of reducing @entity71 matches to four days			1
this would be achieved by introducing the unrealistic target of playing 105 overs a day — a move that would destroy the primacy of the ultimate game			0
former @entity17 batsman @entity7 has been linked with a return to the national side recently if @entity12 wants to make himself useful , then he should concentrate on his supposed main aim of introducing a 10 - team @entity108 franchise @entity107 competition			1
everybody bar a few myopic counties wants that			0
he could also do something about a crippling fixture list that will see @entity17 play 17 tests in the next 10 months — a key factor in why they have fallen so far behind in the 50 - over game and just endured the worst @entity117 in their history			0
there is much for the @entity14 's new regime — which includes new chief executive @entity121 and communications director @entity122 — to do , but all the new chairman has done so far is make things worse			0
@entity12 should think very carefully in future before he speaks .			0

incoming @entity14 chairman @entity12 has handled the *potential* return of @entity7 very poorly
@entity12 has pitched several *outlandish* ideas about reducing test matches to four days
he should focus his attention on addressing the @entity17 fixture *congestion*
