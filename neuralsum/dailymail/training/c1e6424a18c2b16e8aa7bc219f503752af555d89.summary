like most youngsters , their play can get a little wild			2
but five - month - old grizzly bear @entity4 and 16 - month - old @entity6 are the most unlikely friends			1
for while together they resemble a pair of cuddly toys , they would normally live on different continents			0
and when they grow up , @entity4 is likely to be about nine times the size of his chimp pal			1
but the young males have been inseparable since being introduced at the @entity17 in @entity18 , where they were born			0
@entity4 the grizzly bear cub and @entity6 the chimp have become firm friends the five - month - old bear and 16 - month - old chimp live at the @entity24 in @entity18 the pair love to play together and have been best of friends since they were introduced visitors delight in watching them wrestling and playing tag			1
in the wild , @entity4 would live in the wilds of @entity32 , while @entity6 ’s natural home is the jungle of @entity35			1
park owner @entity36 said staff decided to see whether the pair would hit it off when @entity4 reached the same size as @entity6 – even though bears grow much faster than chimps			1
‘ we got them out there playing on a sunny day and they went on and on for hours , ’ he said			0
‘ neither of them wanted to quit			0
they would lie down and fall asleep at our feet , wake back up and start wrestling again			0
’ dr @entity36 added : ‘ @entity4 has more power , but @entity52 tricks him			1
