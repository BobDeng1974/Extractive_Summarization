by @entity1 reporter published : 17:09 est , 26 april 2012 updated : 08:10 est , 27 april 2012 a voicemail message in which @entity4 's mistress makes fun of her lover 's cancer - stricken wife has been released as the former @entity10 politician stands trial accused of using campaign money to hide his affair in 2008			1
@entity15 , who was pregnant with @entity4 's child as he vied to become @entity18 's running mate , left the message for his aide @entity20 as she watched the then senator on television			1
she can be heard laughing down the phone as she points out the awkward body language between @entity4 and his wife - who had terminal cancer			1
' the have footage of it on @entity29 , @entity18 leaving the house shaking his hand , um , and @entity32 , and , and , @entity33 and @entity32 could n't be further apart from each other ( laughter ) , ' she says			1
so , so , yea , interesting , ' she continued			2
the video that @entity54 was referring to , shown above , was captured from a helicopter who spotted mr @entity18 , who was the front - runner in the @entity10 race , making a private visit to the @entity4 ' @entity61 home after a meeting with the senator			1
in the short clip , it shows mr @entity18 leaving their house , shaking @entity4 ' hand and giving him a hug before riding off in his black suv			1
once mr @entity18 leaves , @entity4 and @entity32 walk back into the home standing several feet apart from one another			1
then and now : @entity15 appeared on extra in 2008 ( left ) and was seen more recently with her daughter @entity74 ( right ) who she had with @entity4 the voicemail messages come on day four of the @entity77 's corruption trial and was one of about 13 between @entity4 , @entity20 , and @entity54 that the prosecution put into the record of evidence			1
a number of the other voicemails consist of @entity4 calling @entity20 and ' checking in '			1
at the time , @entity20 and his family were travelling with the pregnant @entity54 , after @entity20 initially claimed the paternity in order to keep the heat off of @entity4			1
in several of the messages , @entity4 makes mention of his wife being in his presence , effectively stifling what he really wants to say			1
the prosecution also put pictures of the expensive hotels where the @entity96 and @entity54 stayed during this trip , allegedly on the campaign 's dime			0
@entity4 ' defense lawyer on thursday picked apart ex-aide @entity20 's story that he was asked to conceal @entity4 ' affair with a mistress with campaign money , accusing him of making up stories about the former presidential contender to make money off of the scandal			1
letter from donor : this handwritten note from @entity112 shows her lamenting over the fact that the press skewered @entity4 ' $ 400 haircuts , and she said that she would take care of bills payments : ms @entity122 would write that her donations were for expensive furniture , like the table this $ 10,000 check was for , rather than the alleged payments to hide @entity54 @entity20 took the witness stand for a fourth straight day at @entity4 ' campaign finance fraud trial			1
the star prosecution witness is key to the government 's case that while campaigning for the @entity133 in 2008 , @entity4 directed a scheme to use nearly $ 1million in secret payments from two wealthy donors to conceal an affair with his pregnant mistress			1
@entity4 has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts and faces up to 30 years behind bars if convicted			1
the defence argued in opening statements that @entity20 spent most of the money at issue in the case to build a $ 1.5million house for his family , not to buy the silence of @entity4 ' mistress , @entity15			1
the defence sought to undermine @entity20 's credibility and paint him as a pathological liar			0
defence lawyer @entity153 pointed out inconsistencies with @entity20 's account of the scandal at trial this week and in multiple other accounts , including grand jury testimony and his 2010 tell - all book about @entity4			2
repeatedly , @entity153 accused @entity20 of lying			0
referring to the timing of a conversation with a law partner of @entity4 , @entity153 asked , ‘ and you made that up too , did n't you ? ’ conflicting stories : @entity4 ( left ) and his former aide @entity20 ( left ) are detailing the 2008 affair troubles : @entity20 told the court yesterday that @entity4 described life with @entity32 as a ' living hell ' after she found out about the affair december 14 , @entity174 to @entity175 , if that 's , if i 'm calling saying what happened , how did this happen , what 's goin ' on , then that 's because @entity32 's standing there with me			1
' cause i have to , i think i 've got ta tell her about this because it 's moving			0
' december @entity184 to @entity185 'm just checkin ' in with you and , and makin ' sure you 're safe and , and in a place where you 're good and you can just call me back january 8 , @entity188 to @entity175 , just wanted for all of you , including her , to know that i am thinking about you			0
' january 10 , @entity190 to @entity20 ' ( @entity4 ) wants you to know that he 's not taking your call or her call right now because of , uh , his circumstances with , uh , the @entity196 , and not to take it personally , but it 'll get better soon			2
but right now he 's in a bad place			0
so , do n't get your feelings hurt if your calls are not being returned or her calls are not being returned			0
' february 17 , 2008 @entity15 to @entity20 ' they have footage of it on @entity29 tonight , @entity18 leaving the house shaking his hand , um , and @entity32 , and , and , @entity33 and @entity32 could n't be further apart from each other ( laughter )			1
i mean , on either side , like of the driveway			0
so , so , yea , interesting			0
' ‘ no , sir , ’ @entity20 responded			0
@entity153 asked @entity20 whether he first learned @entity54 , was pregnant in may 2007 , as his book says : in june 2007 , as he testified ; or in early july , a date backed by phone records and @entity54 's medical records			0
the timeline issues could challenge the accounts of conversations @entity20 said he had with @entity4 in a car discussing who to ask for money to help take care of @entity54 and discussing @entity54 's pregnancy			2
@entity20 said he could n't recall the exact date for either event			0
@entity153 also challenged @entity20 on which amount of secret money a wealthy heiress said she would provide to help make @entity4 president - $ 1.2million , as he testified this week , or $ 900,000 and $ 925,000 , figures he had previously given			2
@entity20 said the number he provided this week is the correct one			0
@entity20 had falsely claimed paternity of @entity4 ' daughter , @entity234 , while @entity4 was campaigning for president			2
@entity4 acknowledged he had fathered the child two years later			2
as @entity238 's detailed questioning continued , some jurors appeared distracted and even @entity241 district court judge @entity239 grew impatient			0
‘ i 'm not quite following , ’ the judge told @entity238 after he asked @entity20 a question about whose idea it was for @entity20 to claim paternity of @entity54 's child			0
‘ we 're about to beat a dead horse here			0
’ she warned the attorney she might cut off his questions if they were n't relevant to the criminal charges facing @entity4			2
‘ you 're going to get to the money , right ? ’ she asked @entity153			0
@entity20 was expected to remain on the stand throughout all of thursday			0
his wife , @entity257 , could take the stand on friday			2

@entity15 laughs in message to aide at the awkward body language between @entity4 and his wife as she watched them on television
@entity267 showed @entity18 visiting the @entity4 home
other voicemails include @entity4 ' checking in ' with aide who was *chaperoning* mistress
