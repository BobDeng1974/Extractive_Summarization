two leading players questioned why there was no ambulance on site after @entity4 was struck on the head by a ball in the @entity7 on thursday			1
@entity4 was on the 16th fairway at @entity9 when he was hit by an errant drive from @entity12 's @entity11 on the 14th			1
according to the @entity14 , @entity4 did not lose consciousness and received treatment on the course from a doctor and a paramedic before he was taken to hospital			1
@entity4 was later discharged from hospital and wrote on @entity40 that he would now take a few weeks off , but the incident caused a delay of almost two hours and left @entity44 pair @entity43 and @entity45 particularly unhappy			1
in reference to the death of caddie @entity48 in @entity49 earlier this season , @entity43 wrote on @entity40 : ' seems like @ fabrizanotti is ok			1
how is it possible there is no ambulance on site after what happened in @entity49			0
' @entity45 added on @entity40 : ' let 's hope now that the second incident will guarantee ambulances on site for everybody 's safety			1
' in a statement released to @entity64 , tournament director @entity62 said : ' @entity4 received impeccable medical care and attention from the team of doctors and paramedics who were already on site as part of the tournament and who are fully equipped to deal with any medical emergency			1
' they subsequently deemed it necessary for @entity4 to go to hospital as a precaution for further assessment and we are pleased to report that he has been discharged after receiving the all clear			2
' @entity7 director @entity80 added : ' we have worked with @entity81 to upgrade the medical provision at this year 's @entity7			2
' unfortunately , there was not an ambulance on site , as requested by @entity81 , since we took the decision not to have one because the first aid provision on site was capable of dealing with an incident like this , and indeed any other medical emergency			0
@entity45 said he hoped the second accident in a short time period would lead to a change in policy ' let 's hope now that the second incident will guarantee ambulances on site for everybody 's safety , ' he tweeted ' the hospitals nearby and the ambulance system in @entity104 could respond quickly if further assistance was required , and indeed the ambulance responded within the parameters of @entity109 law			1
in light of what happened with @entity4 , we now have an ambulance on site for the remainder of the tournament			2
' @entity4 had started his round from the 10th and was level par after six holes when the incident occurred			2
@entity43 carded an opening 66 to lie one shot off the lead held by defending champion @entity122 and @entity124 's @entity123			1
@entity122 carded four birdies , an eagle and just one bogey in his 65 , while @entity123 joined the @entity109 on five under with a birdie on the 16th just before play was suspended for the day			0
play in the first round will resume at 8am on friday			0
@entity11 looks nervous as he watches his fellow professional receive treatment after being hit ' it is always nice to shoot a 65 , ' said @entity122 , who had downplayed his chances of a repeat victory on wednesday			0
' i played well and did n't make any mistakes			0
that 's the key on this course , keep the ball in play and take your chances			0
for me it was a good solid round and i hit some nice spots			0
' sometimes you can be conservative and take irons off the tee but if you feel good with the driver you have to hit it and make a tough hole into a birdie hole			0
it all depends how the winds are but i was hitting my drive well and i tried to take advantage of that			0
' @entity44 's @entity159 and @entity12 's @entity160 were alongside @entity43 on four under , with @entity162 player @entity161 and vice-captain @entity163 off the pace on one over .			2

@entity4 struck on the head by @entity11 's shot
@entity34 and @entity36 withdraw from @entity7 to take their friend to hospital
@entity4 did not lose consciousness and was treated on course by a doctor
incident follows death of caddie @entity48 earlier this season
@entity43 questions how it is possible there are still not ambulances on site
