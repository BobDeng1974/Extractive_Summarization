@entity1 the baby koala is looking for a friend after being brought into a wildlife shelter at @entity4 , 20 km east of @entity5			1
the joey was orphaned when timber workers failed to see him and his mother in a tree they were felling in the @entity12 rushed the 250 gram joey to koala expert @entity14 who has nursed the little boy around the clock for the past two months			1
' koalas are actually incredibly maternal and the mothers will often manage to fall in a way that protects their babies over themselves , ' says @entity21 from the @entity22			2
' this is how we think little @entity1 survived			1
' @entity1 is now five months old and after a special ' every four hour ' feeding routine , has almost doubled in weight			1
@entity21 says he is inseparable from his friend @entity26 the teddy bear , but she needs to find a real life companion to help the joey learn how to survive on his own			2
' it 's very funny , people will see me feeding and they look at this teddy bear and they look at me really strangely until i tell them : " no , there 's a real @entity35 under there , behind @entity26 !			0
@entity21 and volunteers at the @entity22 will tag him and other koalas to track how they 're doing in their natural habitat			0
' we monitor them over the years and there 's just nothing more rewarding than to see a female you 've nursed since it was a joey having young of its own in the bush			0
' according to @entity21 , about 78 per cent of injured or orphaned koalas that are released will survive			1
' we always try to release them close to the areas they come from because they 'll seek those places out - but sometimes this is problematic , ' she says			0
' we 've had some koalas return to bushfire damaged areas and some have died after falling from weak branches that just snap			2
we have problems with cows ; cows hate koalas and will call the rest of the herd to stomp on them - and we have the chlamydia disease which they pick up from other animals like cattle and which is just horrific			0
' @entity21 , who began caring for injured wildlife 19 years ago , says the biggest threats to koala populations in @entity85 are increased habitat destruction , fires and the drying out of the landscape because of climate change			2
' we really do n't know enough about koalas in @entity41 and this is a big concern , we need more research , ' she says			0
@entity1 required special feeds every four hours when he came to the shelter because his stomach had not yet developed the enzymes to breakdown eucalyptus leaves wildlife carer @entity14 said @entity1 was ' borderline ' when he came to the shelter ; ' we usually would n't accept joey koalas under 250 grams because they will rarely make it ' she says , but @entity1 has almost doubled in weight since he first came to the shelter three months ago with joey season starting early this year , @entity21 says she will soon see a lot of babies coming in because of road hits , dog attacks , tree - felling accidents and bushfires			1
she says more than 200 baby koalas came in to the centre last year , and the numbers are growing			2
but for now , @entity1 will continue to enjoy his padded tree fork stand , heated to the temperature of his mother 's pouch			1
and he will most likely be paired up with another adult female to help him socialise			0
' he 's a very lucky boy , ' says @entity119			0
' he 'll do fine			0
' @entity1 and his ' inseparable ' companion @entity26 wildlife carer @entity14 with little @entity1 , who she says has developed a good set of teeth and is now eating native eucalyptus leaves like a proper koala			1
