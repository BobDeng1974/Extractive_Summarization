fighter ace : @entity2 's story is to be told in a @entity4 film dubbed ‘ @entity5 ’ the story of how @entity2 recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of @entity10 ’s greatest fighter aces is remarkable enough			1
but now another astonishing but little - known chapter of his war career is to be told in a @entity4 film being dubbed ‘ @entity5 ’			1
@entity2 – who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 – was shot down over @entity17 in august 1941 and ended up in a @entity19 prison camp in @entity20			1
it was there that the officer , who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick , was involved in a mass break - out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in @entity29 starring @entity30 and @entity31			1
@entity2 ’s life story has already been the subject of the successful film @entity34 in 1956 starring @entity36			2
this latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the @entity20 escape by historian @entity41 called @entity42			1
it was a plot hatched by @entity45 lieutenant @entity44 , 23 , and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire			2
major @entity48 , of the @entity50 , teamed up with @entity2 on the planning			2
the fighter ace went on to describe it as ‘ the most brilliant escape conception of this war ’			0
the ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp ’s music room , where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments			0
they were disguised as bookshelves			0
on the night of the break – august 30 , 1942 – the prisoners managed to fuse the camp ’s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence			2
one ladder collapsed , so only 28 made it over the wire , of which three made a ‘ home run ’ back to freedom			0
@entity29 : @entity2 's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring @entity30 and @entity31 ( pictured ) @entity2 was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the @entity19 that he ended up in the ‘ escape - proof ’ @entity86 and remained in captivity until the end of the war			1
more than 40 @entity91 prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from @entity95 near @entity20 , @entity19 , in 1942			2
major @entity48 , a larger than life 37 - year - old from @entity98 captured while serving in the @entity50 , teamed up with @entity2 on the planning			2
while the @entity5 relied on its famous tunnels , the @entity20 mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders			1
@entity2 described what happened as ' the most brilliant escape conception of this war '			2
months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp 's double perimeter fences			0
@entity2 ’s life story has been the subject of 1956 film @entity34 starring @entity36 ( pictured ) a series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp 's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut			1
they were crafted in the camp 's music room , where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments			0
the escape was codenamed @entity129 because it involved troops from across the @entity10 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			1
the rights to dr @entity41 ’s book ( pictured ) have been bought by production firm @entity136 as the night of the breakout loomed , the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards			1
after the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights , 41 of them carrying four 12 - foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed - wire fence and clambered over			0
one ladder collapsed , so only 28 made it over the barbed wire , of which three made a ' home run ' back to freedom			0
@entity2 later ended up in @entity86 and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war			1
@entity156 and another leading light of the escape @entity159 , also of the @entity50 , survived the war and lived into their 70s			0
both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on august 30 1942			0
but now their story could trump the @entity5 after @entity4 bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian @entity41 's book about the escape @entity42 into a blockbuster			1
the rights to dr @entity41 ’s book have been bought by the makers of 2013 ’s @entity174 with @entity175			1
production firm @entity178 , the makers of the 2013 @entity175 and @entity177 hit saving mr @entity179 , is now working on a script			0
dr @entity41 said a number of ' a-list ' @entity4 stars were queuing up for roles and essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads , although he could not reveal who was interested			1
he said : ' i 'm very , very pleased			0
it 's very , very exciting			0
essential 11 did a fantastic job with saving mr @entity179 and to have that same team working on this is very pleasing			0

@entity2 recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of @entity10 ’s greatest fighter aces
was shot down over @entity17 in 1941 and ended up in @entity19 prison camp
and he was involved in a mass break - out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in @entity29
now , @entity4 bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian @entity41 's book about the escape into a blockbuster
