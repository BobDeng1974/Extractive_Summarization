a couple appeared in court in @entity2 yesterday accused of stashing some £ 50 million - worth of stolen @entity4 art treasures in their garage			1
@entity6 , 74 , and his wife @entity7 , 73 , face up to 10 years in prison for handling the goods , but insist that they were all ‘ presents ’ from the legendary @entity12 artist			1
it was in november 2010 that 271 lithographs , cubist paintings , notebooks and a watercolour were found at their modest home in @entity19 , in the @entity20			2
@entity7 and @entity6 arrive at court for the beginning of their trial in which they stand accused of stashing stolen @entity4 treasures a painting of a hand by @entity4 that was among 271 undocumented , never - before - seen works estimated to be worth at least £ 50million a painting ' still life glass sand ' and a drawing ' @entity34 ( sitting nude ) ' which feature among the 271 hitherto unseen works by @entity4 produced by the artist 's odd job man in a court in nearby @entity40 lawyers for six of @entity4 ’s descendants accused them of hiding the ‘ fraudulently obtained ’ haul			1
mr @entity6 , 75 , claims he was given the collection by the artist and his second wife , @entity45 , when he was an odd job man at their home in @entity48 in @entity49 , near @entity50			1
mr @entity6 installed a burglar alarm at the luxury villa before the artist died in 1973 , and said he accepted them as ‘ thank you ’ gifts			1
referring to @entity4 , mr @entity6 said he ‘ often invited me in to have some cake or a coffee			1
me and the master talked about all things great and small			0
one evening , i was leaving my work , when @entity62 handed me a little package saying : " this is for you "			0
' but @entity4 , the artist ’s son , said that his father was noted for his generosity , but that he always dedicated , dated and signed his gifts , as he knew that some recipients might try to sell the works one day			1
@entity71 , @entity4 ’s barrister , said : ‘ they do n’t remember whether they received the so called gift in 1970 , 71 or 72			2
if you are given @entity76 , you remember it			0
‘ you have to imagine that @entity4 kept hold of them for 70 years and suddenly decided to give the lot away			2
that ’s does n’t make sense			0
’ @entity4 pictured two years before he died in 1973			2
his works are the most stolen of any artist in history @entity4 and @entity85 , @entity87 's son and daughter , pictured outside court yesterday the only document with the name @entity6 on is a signed brochure for a @entity4 exhibition , said mr @entity71			1
adding : ‘ when you give a present , you choose something precise that fits the person			0
‘ @entity4 here is giving away works that have nothing to do with each other - notably extremely precious cubist collages that represent 10 per cent of his production , ’ he said			2
‘ but also two notebooks of drawings , work tools that he would never have given away			0
the issue is not whether @entity4 was generous or not			0
@entity4 was n’t someone who was careless about his works – he did n’t give away just for the sake of it			0
’ @entity112 - @entity111 , lawyer for the couple , said the works came from the artist ’s ‘ @entity119 ’ studio on @entity118 ’s @entity117			0
