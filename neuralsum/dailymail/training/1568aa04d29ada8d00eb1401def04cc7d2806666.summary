keeping your beloved pet happy and occupied can be demanding			2
but photographer @entity2 , 53 , found a novel way of ensuring her ten - year - old border collie , @entity5 , did nâ€™t get bored			1
using nothing more than a few simple commands and a bit of patience , she trained him to balance a stunning array of objects on his head			1
from sausages and bacon to oranges and even three eggs on spoons , it seems there is nothing @entity5 ca n't balance on his head or hold in his mouth			1
@entity5 could already turn on the tv and close doors behind people before he began the balancing act mrs @entity2 , 53 , who lives with husband @entity46 , 55 , a management consultant , in @entity47 , @entity48 , trained @entity5 to stand perfectly still when she says the word ' steady '			1
he will remain in that position until she says ' what a good dog ' , at which point he knows she is about to remove the object and reward him with a biscuit			2
bred for use as sheep dogs , border collies are very intelligent and are known for their ability to pick up commands extremely quickly			0
they are also full of energy and become bored easily , and so need to be kept constantly occupied			0
stock still : mrs @entity2 uses the command ' stay ' , meaning @entity5 will freeze until she says ' what a good dog ' , at which point he knows she is about to remove the objects and give him a treat say cheese : mrs @entity2 , a photographer , lives with husband @entity46 , 55 , a management consultant , in @entity47 , @entity48 , along with the endlessly obedient @entity5 festive : @entity5 is also a hit at any @entity74 party , after being trained to balance mince pies and a fully decorated miniature christmas tree on his head mrs @entity2 had already trained him to turn on her television and close the door behind her , before beginning the balancing act			1
she said : ' border collies are working dogs and like to be kept busy			0
@entity5 always wants to be doing something and he likes to help us			2
' when he was six months old he could already recongnise the names of all his toys and since then he has learned so many commands i have lost count			0
' we were just messing about when we started balancing things on him			0
he loves to please - plus he always gets a treat afterwards			0
' teaching him such tricks is just one way of keeping him busy , and it 's a bit of fun			0
he enjoys being the centre of attention			0
plus there 's nothing worse than a bored border collie			1
' what a cracker : mrs @entity2 said teaching @entity5 the balancing tricks are a god way to keep him busy , adding that ' there 's nothing worse than a bored border collie ' intelligent : mrs @entity2 says @entity5 learned the names of his favourite toys when he was just a few months old and has learned so many commands since then ' i 've lost count ' obedient : mrs @entity2 said @entity5 loves performing his tricks because he wants to be the centre of attention			1
