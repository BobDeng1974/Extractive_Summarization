by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 today claimed it had failed to breakthrough in @entity4 despite its success in the rest of the country - because voters in the capital are more ' media savvy and educated ' than elsewhere			1
@entity13 's party picked up more than 100 seats from @entity15 , the @entity16 and the @entity17 in council elections nationally and is expected to top the @entity20 vote on sunday			1
but mr @entity13 's campaign flopped in the capital , where @entity15 picked up key swing councils from the @entity16			1
@entity2 failed to do as well in @entity4 as it did in the rest of the country			1
the party blamed the capital 's ' educated , cultured and young ' for the snub labour leader @entity29 greeted supporters and councillors at @entity32 in @entity33 , north east @entity4			1
the party 's success in the capital helped stem the national tide to @entity2 @entity15 gained @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity32 councils , while the @entity16 picked up @entity43 upon @entity44 from the @entity17 and held on to @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity2 was asked to explain the party 's poor performance in @entity4			1
speaking on @entity50 ms @entity2 admitted the party had difficulty appealing to the ' educated , cultured and young '			1
she said : ' i think it 's simple and i think most people understand			0
@entity4 is its own person , its own body , its own individual character			0
' it 's very different from the rest of the country			2
look at the social demographic - you have the sort of metropolitan elite who can not really understand the heartache and the pain people around the country are feeling			1
' we have n't really got our message across in @entity4			0
' @entity74 , speaking during a campaign rally this week , was successful in heading off a @entity2 surge - but saw @entity16 voters siphoned off by @entity15 she said @entity4 had a more ' media savvy , well educated population '			1
she added : ' they are more likely to have read some of the negative press there has been about us			0
and i think they are more likely yo have believed it			0
' people outside @entity4 have been far more cynical about the media campaign and the campaign the other parties have waged against us			0
' @entity29 's close ally @entity93 is being credited with masterminding @entity15 's successful campaign in @entity4 the contrast between @entity4 and the rest of the @entity97 is set to pile pressure on the party 's election co-ordinator @entity101			2
in @entity4 , mr @entity29 chose his close ally @entity93 , the shadow justice secretary , to take charge of campaigning up to 2016			0
mr @entity93 ’s campaign focussed on bread and butter help for squeezed families , including higher pay , rent curbs , more housing and the cost of fares			0
@entity15 looks set to come first in both the contest for @entity4 ’s eight @entity114 seats and in @entity4 - wide borough elections			0
@entity2 is expecting to top the @entity20 elections when the results are announced on sunday			2
it was polling 27 per cent as voters went to the polls - followed by @entity15 on 26 and the @entity121 on 22 with the @entity17 one point behind the @entity123 on nine			0
but in @entity4 , @entity2 was trailing a distant third on just 20 per cent - behind @entity15 on 27 per cent and the @entity121 23			2
