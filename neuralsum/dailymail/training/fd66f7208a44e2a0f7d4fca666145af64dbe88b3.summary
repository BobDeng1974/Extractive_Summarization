lying among a pile of papers at the hideout in @entity3 where @entity4 was shot dead was a carefully worded 21 - page letter			1
it warned of the rise of a new and ruthless group of @entity10 extremists capable of such extreme brutality that @entity12 should sever all links with them			1
in fact , it claimed the @entity16 ( or @entity16 ) had such complete disregard for civilian life that it could damage the reputation of @entity12 – if such a thing were possible for an organisation that has long traded in murderous terrorism			1
in essence , the letter said that @entity16 was simply too extreme even for the group that killed thousands in the @entity39 on september 11 , 2001			1
today , @entity16 , which now styles itself as simply @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , has become a powerful military force that has control of an area larger than @entity47			1
living under its ultra-conservative interpretation of @entity10 are six million people , a population larger than that of @entity53 , @entity54 or @entity55			1
its trademark black jihadi flag has fluttered in the background of chilling ‘ promotional ’ videos of executions – including crucifixions and beheadings – as the militia seizes vast areas of @entity65 and @entity66			1
in short , the ‘ caliphate ’ – or @entity10 state – it claims to have established represents the biggest shift in the political geography of the @entity69 since the borders of modern @entity65 and @entity66 were drawn under the @entity74 drafted between @entity47 and @entity75 in 1916			1
discovery : a letter warning of the rise of @entity16 was discovered at the hideout in @entity3 where @entity4 was shot dead to understand the threat @entity42 poses to the region , it first needs to be appreciated how it has grown into a force to rival @entity12			1
the group was founded by 43 - year - old @entity86 , a firebrand cleric held prisoner for four years by @entity90 troops in @entity65			1
the leader , a @entity92 who despises the @entity94 - run @entity65 government , now commands more than 10,000 fighters , many of them former @entity97 - era soldiers or disenchanted @entity98 who lost power and influence after the fall of the dictator ’s regime			1
more worryingly , foreign @entity10 extremists , including about 500 @entity105 , have joined is to fight in @entity66 and @entity65			2
the group controls valuable oil fields and , with the help of wealthy @entity92 backers from the @entity110 , is estimated to have amassed a staggering £ 1.2billion			2
it has even sold 8,000 - year - old antiquities it has seized			2
' too extreme ' : the letter found in the hideout used by @entity4 ( left ) catalogued some of the acts of barbarism undertaken by the group founded by cleric @entity86 ( pictured right in a @entity90 ' wanted ' poster ) but its real assets lie in the fanatical loyalty of its fighters ( they all swear allegiance to @entity43 ) and the state - of - the - art weaponry they now possess			1
much of its armoury was seized during a lightning advance several weeks ago , when fleeing @entity65 troops abandoned the artillery and armoured vehicles that they had been given by @entity90 forces			2
with captured @entity90 humvees and the latest precision firepower , it is more than a match for the formidable @entity141 peshmerga – which defends the @entity141 ’ semi-autonomous region in the north – and its 12.7mm @entity145 - era machine guns and outdated @entity147 t - 55 tanks			2
as @entity152 , a former @entity90 official who advised @entity90 generals in @entity65 , has said : ‘ they are literally outgunned by an is that is fighting with hundreds of millions of dollars of @entity90 military equipment seized from the @entity150 , which abandoned it			0
’ so it would be naive in the extreme to think of @entity42 as a motley crew of scrappers			1
a force capable of meting out so much wanton violence is invariably led by commanders who rule with an iron will			0
chilling : @entity43 's trademark black jihadi flag has fluttered in the background of chilling ' promotional ' videos as the militia seizes vast areas of @entity65 and @entity66 but what marks them out as being particularly savvy is the way they have used social networking sites like @entity173 and @entity174 to create a digital ‘ public relations ’ machine to promote their jihad and strike fear into the hearts of their enemies			2
any fighter on the ground can film an act of brutality and upload the footage in a matter of minutes – although some videos of botched amputations or killings have led to a clampdown by @entity43 commanders			0
one @entity196 fighter promised to upload a film of a man being crucified for his friends back home , but was quickly reprimanded by his superiors			0
his later contrite posting simply read , ‘ our leadership forbade anyone filming it			0
’ however , the videos already in circulation have already created a climate of terror			0
some opposition soldiers , particularly in @entity66 , are defecting to the group			0
after all , @entity43 has money – some of which is said to have come through private donations from @entity216 and @entity217			0
equally , those captured by the militia face a stark choice – defect or die			0
despite being trained by @entity90 troops , the @entity65 army has proven worryingly ineffective in taking on this threat			0
it ’s why the terrorists now control much of the north of the country			2
they have also seized a former chemical weapons plant and a large dam that could be blown up to flood the regions downstream			0
escape : thousands of @entity233 trapped in the @entity235 mountains as they tried to escape from @entity42 forces , are rescued by @entity238 forces and @entity239 ( @entity240 ) in @entity241 , @entity65 the populations of the @entity141 capital of @entity244 , as well as the national capital @entity35 , are now in no doubt as to the fate that would befall them if these @entity92 extremists prevail			1
if @entity43 can not be stopped , they are clinging to the hope that rescue will come in the form of @entity254 , which supports @entity65 ’s @entity94 - led government , or the @entity90			2
however , both countries are reluctant to commit troops on the ground in the political and religious quagmire of @entity65			0
@entity86 knows this only too well			0
it is why his is troops have been so emboldened to sweep across much of @entity66 and northern @entity65 in recent weeks			0
in the past fortnight they have fought on five fronts : against the @entity65 army , the @entity141 peshmerga , @entity270 ’s @entity66 regime , the @entity66 opposition and the @entity273 army			0
when he was released by the @entity90 military police from the @entity277 detention facility in @entity278 , where he was held as an insurgent , @entity86 said ominously : ‘ i will see you guys in @entity283			0
’ a fanciful threat ? perhaps not , when you consider that the greatest threat @entity42 poses to the world is that this so - called caliphate becomes a training ground for international terrorism , and unleashes an army of extremists against the @entity293 to kill and maim far from the bloodsoaked deserts of @entity65 .			1
