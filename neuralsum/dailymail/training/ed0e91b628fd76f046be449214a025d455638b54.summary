by @entity0 published : 10:36 est , 29 april 2012 updated : 11:38 est , 30 april 2012 a murderous seagull that gobbled up a duckling got more than it bargained for when it returned for another helping			1
it swooped on the ducklings as they swam with their parents in @entity8 , @entity9 , last week			1
but the mother duck , who initially had eleven ducklings in tow , finally forced the gull away by aggressively flapping her wings			1
foiled : the seagull scoops the chick out of the water , but drops it when the mother swoops in brave : the fearless mother is not deterred by the seagull 's size advantage in a flap : the angry mother proved she was no sitting duck and chased the attacker away taking flight : the seagull is in no mood to hang around photographer @entity33 said : ‘ i was taking pictures in the park and saw this gull watching the young family			1
‘ this is the time of year ducks raise their young , so predatory birds like gulls are always on the look out for an easy meal			2
‘ the gull was waiting for one of the ducklings to stray from the group and when it finally spotted one it swooped in for the kill			2
murder most fowl : the seagull successfully securing a first course ‘ the gull was able to grab hold of a duckling in its beak			2
‘ but when it came back for a second helping mum was ready and fought the gull away until it had to turn tail and fly off			0
‘ the chick ducked under the water			0
there was a lot of quacking and squawking going on			0
‘ it was a stressful moment for the mother , but in the end she saved her family			0
’ happy family : the ducklings with their protective mother			0
