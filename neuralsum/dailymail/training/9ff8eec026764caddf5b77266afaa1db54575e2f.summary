by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 03:17 est , 26 february 2013 @entity3 's webbing really could stop a train if it recreated what exists in nature , research has shown			0
in the film @entity8 , the superhero shoots strands of the material at surrounding buildings to prevent a runaway train plummeting to disaster			0
the scene seems far fetched even by @entity17 standards , but not according to a group of young @entity20 scientists investigating the amazing properties of spider 's silk			1
in @entity24 , @entity3 used his spider 's web to stop a train			2
researchers now say a spider has been found that actually has silk strong enough to so this the spider , from @entity32 creates orb - shaped webs tougher than any other known and more than 10 times stronger than @entity34			1
juvenile males also weave spider webs , but once they become adults , they abandon this behaviour and instead direct their energies solely to sex			2
for survival , the @entity42 's bark spider relies in part on its mottled , jagged appearance , which camouflages the spider against trees and - along with @entity42 - inspired its name			1
an analysis of the @entity42 's bark spider 's silk indicates it 's the toughest biological material discovered to date			1
they calculated that , scaled up to @entity3 proportions , it would be strong enough to halt a four - car @entity56 subway train travelling at full speed			2
the three @entity60 physics students worked out the force needed to overcome the train 's momentum - an enormous 300,000 newtons			0
to avoid breaking , every cubic metre of @entity3 's web would have to soak up almost 500 million joules of energy			0
incredibly , they found one spider spins silk that is up to the job			2
@entity42 's bark spider , from @entity32 , creates orb - shaped webs tougher than any other known and more than 10 times stronger than @entity34			1
one of the young scientists , @entity76 , 21 , from @entity77 upon @entity78 , @entity79 , said : ' it is often quoted that spider webs are stronger than steel , so we thought it would be interesting to see whether this held true for @entity3 's scaled up version			1
' considering the subject matter , we were surprised to find out that the webbing was portrayed accurately			0
' the @entity42 's bark spider , from @entity32 , creates orb - shaped webs tougher than any other known and more than 10 times stronger than @entity34 the research is published today in the latest issue of the @entity60 's @entity91			1
each year the journal features original short papers written by master of physics degree @entity95 - author @entity94 , 22 , from @entity97 , @entity98 , said : ' while our work may not seem to be very serious it has helped teach us about applying physics to varying situations as well as the peer review process through which scientific journals operate			0
' this makes it an invaluable experience to anyone who wants to go into research later in life			0
' @entity111 as @entity3 in the film based on the @entity114 comic book character : researchers now say that spider silk is strong enough to stop a train - if enough is used course leader dr @entity118 , a lecturer in the @entity119 , said : ' a lot of the papers published in the journal are on subjects that are amusing , topical or a bit off - the - wall			1
' our fourth years are nothing if not creative			0
' but , to be a research physicist - in industry or academia - you need to show some imagination , to think outside the box , and this is certainly something that the module allows our students to practice			0

young scientists calculated exactly how strong spider silk would be if used in large *quantities*
found the @entity42 's bark spider , from @entity32 , creates orb - shaped webs tougher than any other known and more than 10 times stronger than @entity34
