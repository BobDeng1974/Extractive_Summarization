@entity3 's most dangerous roads are in @entity1 , a new report has revealed			1
the county was named as the place where more drivers , passengers and pedestrians were killed than anywhere else in the country			1
the study also found that residents living in rural communities nationally were more likely to be ' killed or seriously injured ' on the roads			2

@entity22 , pictured , had the highest road casualty rate on roads in @entity3 , according to a new study this is compared to more urban areas where casualty rates were well below the national average			1

those in the @entity35 of @entity36 had the highest in @entity3 , with both @entity1 and @entity37 having three constituencies each in the top ten			1
it concluded that @entity41 , @entity1 , had the highest road casualty rate in @entity3			1

' traffic danger has a significant negative influence on society , it discourages people from walking or cycling , restricts the freedom of children and means vulnerable road users feel intimidated			0
' despite great improvements in emergency services and trauma care , thousands of victims of road collisions are left with life - changing injuries while the families of casualties also find their lives changed forever			0

' now , for the first time , mps have specific road casualty information based on their constituency boundaries and its residents			0
' we hope the @entity131 will provide a catalyst for action aimed at reducing deaths and injury at a local level , as the diversity of results demonstrate there is a no ' one size fits all ' solution			0
' @entity142 will become a vital tool in helping improve the safety of @entity3 's roads .			1
