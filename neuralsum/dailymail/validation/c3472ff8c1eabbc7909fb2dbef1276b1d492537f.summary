as five years as prime minister @entity0 should have a decent stock of anecdotes to keep a room of voters entertained			1
but in an advert break for last night 's tv election contest the @entity6 leader took the chance to perform his own party trick			1
in front of more than 100 voters and studio crew , he recited a verse from his favourite childhood song : @entity16 ( the @entity17 in the @entity18 )			1
during a break he told @entity31 presenter @entity30 how the chart - topping song by @entity33 was the only one he could sing in full			1
she tweeted : ' just heard from @entity26 that he can sing @entity16 and nothing else ... ' the @entity35 could not be persuaded to showcase this talent , but did prove his love of the song by reciting the first verse			1
@entity39 added : ' he did n't sing but he did recite ' you could hear the hoof beats pound as they raced across the ground ... ' mr @entity0 's love of the song first emerged in 2006 when he appeared on @entity47 and revealed it would be one of the songs he would take to the fictional island			1
' this really just reminds me of my childhood , ' he said at the time			1
' when you are asked to sing a song , this is , i 'm afraid , the only song whose words i can remember			1
' the private rendition for the audience in last night 's tv studio might explain why he got a relatively easy time from them when the cameras went live			1
while mr @entity0 was asked about treating the elderly with dignity and the depth of spending cuts , mr @entity67 faced a series of aggressive questions			1
mr @entity0 waves to the audience after taking questions in the first tv contest of the general election campaign the @entity6 leader 's first question from the audience was : ' what do you think are @entity67 's best qualities ? ' one of the few off - the - cuff questions from @entity39 to the pm was : ' have you ever had three shredded wheat ? ' when mr @entity67 face the audience , he was first asked : ' you sound gloomy most of the time , are things really so bad ? ' another asked : ' do you not think that your brother would have done a better job ? he was better qualified and better positioned			1
' mr @entity0 and mr @entity67 faced the wrath of voters - and @entity94 - last night as they were forced to defend their broken promises , judgement and ability to lead the country in the first prime - time tv contest of the general election			1
they were interviewed by @entity94 for 18 minutes each , and also took questions from a studio audience with ms @entity30 acting as moderator on the show broadcast on @entity31 and @entity108			2
this afternoon @entity109 had received 254 complaints - all of which were about perceived bias against the @entity115 leader			1
it is thought they have been generated by a social media campaign sharing a link to the watchdog 's website and urging people to complain			2
@entity94 appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing prime minister @entity0 an @entity109 spokesman said : ' we are assessing the complaints before deciding whether or not to investigate			1
' a @entity108 spokeswoman said it had received around 300 complaints , but was unable to say specifically what they were about			1
' both politicians , one of whom is likely to be the next prime minister , agreed to the format and were prepared for and actively participated in robust questioning about their policies and abilities			1
neither party has expressed any dissatisfaction to @entity108 , ' she added			2
labour insiders privately noted that they thought @entity39 ' intervened and followed up aggressively a number of times '			2
at one point @entity39 told mr @entity67 : ' that 's a politicians answer there is n't it ? ' she also pressed him on the impact of his leadership victory over his brother @entity154			1
when the @entity115 leader said family relations had been strained , @entity39 responded : ' your poor mum			2
' in a series of posts on @entity161 , @entity39 took on her critics			2
hundreds of people have lodged complaints with tv watchdogs that @entity30 and @entity94 were biased against @entity67 you could hear the hoof beats pound as they raced across the ground , and the clatter of the wheels as they spun ' round and ' round			1
and he galloped into market street , his badge upon his chest , his name was @entity16 , and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west			2
now @entity16 loved a widow , a lady known as @entity184 , she lived all alone in @entity186 at number 22			2
they said she was too good for him , she was haughty , proud and chic , but @entity16 got his cocoa there three times every week			2
they called him @entity22 , ( @entity195 ) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west			2
she said she 'd like to bathe in milk , he said , ' all right , sweetheart , ' and when he 'd finished work one night he loaded up the cart			0
he said , 'd ' you want it pasturize ? ' cause pasturize is best , ' she says , ' @entity16 , i 'll be happy if it comes up to my chest			0
' that tickled old @entity16 , ( @entity195 ) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west			0
now @entity16 had a rival , an evil - looking man , called two - @entity210 from @entity211 and he drove the baker 's van			0
comedian @entity33 pictured as @entity16 receiving a ticket from a policeman he tempted her with his treacle tarts and his tasty wholemeal bread , and when she seen the size of his hot meat pies it very near turned her head			1
she nearly swooned at his macaroon and he said , ' if you treat me right , you 'll have hot rolls every morning and crumpets every night			0
' he knew once she sampled his layer cake he 'd have his wicked way , and all @entity16 had to offer was a pint of milk a day			0
@entity16 , ( @entity195 ) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west			0
one lunch time @entity210 saw @entity16 's horse and cart outside her door , it drove him mad to find it was still there at half past four			0
and as he lept down from his van hot blood through his veins did course , and he went across to @entity16 's cart and did n't half kick his ' orse			0
whose name was @entity252 , ( @entity253 ) and he pulled the fastest milk cart in the west			0
now @entity16 rushed out into the street , his gold top in his hand , he said , ' if you wan na marry @entity260 you 'll fight for her like a man			0
' ' oh why do n't we play cards for her ? ' he sneeringly replied , ' and just to make it interesting we 'll have a shilling on the side			0
' now @entity16 dragged him from his van and beneath the blazing sun , they stood there face to face , and @entity210 went for his bun			0
but @entity16 was too quick , things did n't go the way @entity210 planned , and a strawberry - flavoured yogurt sent it spinning from his hand			0
now @entity260 ran between them and tried to keep them apart , and @entity22 , he pushed her aside and a rock cake caught him underneath his heart			0
and he looked up in pained surprise and the concrete hardened crust , of a stale pork pie caught him in the eye and @entity16 bit the dust			0
@entity16 , ( @entity195 ) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west			0
@entity16 was only 52 , he did n't wan na die , and now he 's gone to make deliveries in that milk round in the sky			0
where the customers are angels and ferocious dogs are banned , and the milkman 's life is full of fun in that fairy , dairy land			1
but a woman 's needs are many fold and soon she married @entity210 , but strange things happened on their wedding night as they lay in their bed			0
was that the trees a-rustling ? or the hinges of the gate ? or @entity16 's ghostly gold tops a-rattling in their crate ? they wo n't forget @entity16 , ( @entity316 ) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west .			0
