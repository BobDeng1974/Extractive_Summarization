by @entity0 published : 10:24 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 19 february 2013 a widow who lost her husband to cancer three years ago is now fighting a battle with @entity5 to create end - of - life sympathy cards			1
activist and artist @entity7 has been petitioning for the immensely popular card company to create a line of hospice cards that are meant to say goodbye to friends , loved ones , and acquaintances			1
though the greeting card company has plenty of ‘ @entity21 ’ cards and sympathy cards if the worst should happen , there are no cards specifically designed for someone in terminal care			2
last respects : artist and activist @entity7 , pictured , is trying to get @entity5 to create a series of cards meant for hospice patients available options now : two current options from @entity5 's ' @entity21 ' section , neither of which mrs @entity7 believes appropriate for a person who is terminally ill speaking to @entity35 from her home in @entity37 , mrs @entity7 said that she hopes to change the way the card giant looks at end of life , saying that the flow of cards to her husband @entity44 stopped as soon as he was moved into hospice care for his terminal liver cancer			1
fear of the unknown : mrs @entity7 says thatnot knowing what to say or how to say it stops many people from sending cards to people in hospice care ‘ when my husband @entity44 and i were in rehab , we had all these great cards saying fight the good fight , you can do it , cheering you on , thinking you could actually have an effect on cancer			1
’ but when mr @entity67 ’s cancer worsened and he was moved to hospice , the flow of well - wishes and cards stopped abruptly			1
‘ people did n’t know what to say , ’ the mother of two explained			0
‘ some people would send “ @entity72 ” and a few sent “ @entity76 ” cards			2
my husband actually chortled and said , “ i ’m not dead yet ! ” ’ mr @entity67 passed away from cancer on june 17 , 2009			2
mrs @entity7 , who worked several years at a retail store that sold greeting cards , said she started working on the idea when her husband was still alive			1
adding a row of cards clearly labled as ‘ end of life , ’ she said , will show people there ’s an option for that difficult time in life , and start a dialogue on how to say goodbye to loved ones			2
‘ people are scared to say goodbye			0
and because they ’re so scared , they do n’t do it , ’ she said			0
mrs @entity7 wrote on her blog that @entity5 did not recognize the word ‘ hospice ’ or ‘ end of life ’ in its search engine , instead pointing out a card for a @entity100			1
according to @entity101 , mrs @entity7 tried for a year to get in touch with company representatives to address end of life cards			1
loss : @entity67 was diagnosed with @entity106 cancer and passed away in 2009 in hospice care options : in response to mrs @entity7 's request , @entity5 offered a series of cards like these ; the widow points out that the card on the right still does n't have the right message in her latest effort , she created the @entity120 petition , which has more than 3,200 supporters			1
finally , @entity5 introduced nine greeting cards specifically for people in hospice care			1
one card features a curly script with the words ‘ caring thoughts are with you ’ on the cover			0
inside , the card reads : ‘ nothing can ease the difficulty of what is happening in your life , but every day – you are wished a little peace of mind			0
’ another more twee card shows an illustrated sheep with the accompanying text : ‘ i ’m not sure what to do , i ’m not sure what to say … but one things ’ for sure – i promise to pray ! ’ ' i began advocacy before @entity44 died			0
he saw this beginning and he 's incredibly proud			0
he got to see that and i know he ’d be so happy			0
' another one reads : ‘ cancer is tough , but you are tougher ! ’ mrs @entity7 told @entity35 that while this is a step in the right direction , the message is still off , especially to patients who are not religious or who simply will not win the battle against the disease			2
‘ if you ’re going to talk about win and lose , cancer just won , ’ she said , adding that people may mean well with their words of encouragement , they may not be the words a very ill person wants to hear			0
family : mr @entity67 pictured in hospital with their two sons , now seven and 14 ; she says he would be proud of the work she 's doing @entity5 spokesperson @entity170 told @entity35 that while it is true the company does n't carry cards ' that specifically say " hospice , " we do have quite a few that address the need @entity177 has quite accurately expressed tp provide support and care for people at the end of life			1
' she added that many of @entity5 's cards can be personalized ' if the suggested message is not quite what the individual is looking for			2
' the company also wrote in a recent news release that they have ‘ nearly 100 cards to help people share words of support for a range of life situations , including cancer treatment , terminal illness , grief support , recovery / rehab , and other difficult times , as well as cards for caregivers			2
’ the new line of hospice care cards will be appearing in @entity5 stores throughout the year			1
‘ i began advocacy before @entity44 died			0
he saw this beginning and he ’s incredibly proud			0
he got to see that and i know he ’d be so happy			0
‘ before we hit hospice , it was the worst part of our lives , and i ’m so glad that i can do this for him , ’ she said .			0
