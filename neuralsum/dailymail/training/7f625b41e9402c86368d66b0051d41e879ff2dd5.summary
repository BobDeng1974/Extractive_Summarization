labour politicians in attendance included mr @entity9 , deputy leader and media spokesman @entity40 , her special adviser @entity41 , former lord chancellor @entity41 and labour chief whip @entity42			2
@entity24 leader @entity24 was also present for most of the discussion			1
fuelled by @entity45 and delivery pizza , the talks lasted until 2.30am			0
@entity4 sources insisted mr @entity2 had discussed the prime minister ’s ‘ red lines ’ with him beforehand and made only ‘ tiny ’ concessions			0

‘ it delivered cross-party support and that means it is much harder for the press to make politics out of this by divide and rule			0
‘ it is true to say that in the negotiations last night concessions and gains were made by him in terms of scope and the timing of exemplary damages – those are the only significant changes that were made that they had requested			0
