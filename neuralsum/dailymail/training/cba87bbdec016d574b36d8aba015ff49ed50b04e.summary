residents in the wealthy @entity13 commuter belt town of @entity14 , which has its own castle ruins , are taking up the cudgels over whether to welcome the discount store			1
the town already has a @entity20 and @entity19 , while @entity21 has won permission to open one of its ‘ @entity26 ’ convenience stores without any sign of controversy			1
@entity41 against them is @entity44 ’s second biggest supermarket chain , and more than 370 locals who have signed a petition supporting the scheme			1
the rhetoric in the battle of the online petitions is distinctly earthy with accusations of snobbery and claims opponents are nothing more than ‘ stuck up , toffee nosed twits ’			0
@entity3 is making a concerted effort to move into @entity4 – as is its @entity44 rival @entity59 – by snapping up sites in locations where homes cost more than £ 1million			1

the woman behind the petition opposing @entity3 in @entity14 , @entity84 , insists the town does not have the roads and services to support a new supermarket and the 30 flats above			1
she said : ‘ our town is becoming overcrowded with new homes and no extra infrastructure to support them			0
‘ @entity14 does not need another supermarket , budget or otherwise			1
what it needs is new schools , doctors ’ surgeries and other services that a community expects its governing bodies to provide			0
’ other supporters of her petitions complained it would lead to overdevelopment of the main high street leading to congestion , while many felt it did not match @entity14 ’s @entity113 brand			2
one wrote simply : ‘ do n’t want to lower the tone of the town			2
’ another said : ’ personally do n’t think it fits in @entity14 branding			0
’ a third complained : ‘ we are a @entity119 keep it that way ! and yes @entity121 is pricey but we have a good looking town ! ’ another wrote : ‘ i think our traditional high streets should be protected against these poxy low budget corporations that wipe out local trade			0
’ one contributor joked : ‘ one good thing about @entity3 coming to @entity14 : it ’ll keep the riff - raff away from @entity20			1

’ another said : ‘ @entity163 said @entity132			0
i am sure they would welcome another @entity20 but do n’t want @entity121 to be known as a @entity3 town			1
’ a third supporter wrote : ‘ there may be good reasons to criticise @entity3 but let ’s face , the only reason these moaners are trying to stop this is because a low - budget shop will lower the tone of the area and bring their precious house prices tumbling down			1
bring it on , i say ! ’ @entity3 is enjoying enormous success in the @entity180 with some 600 outlets and sales growing at more than 17per cent a year as it takes customers from the big four – @entity19 , @entity186 , @entity187 ’s and @entity188 ‘ deluxe ’ range is particularly designed to win middle class shoppers			2
