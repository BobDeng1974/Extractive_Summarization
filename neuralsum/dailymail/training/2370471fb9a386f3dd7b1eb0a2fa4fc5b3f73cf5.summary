@entity0 open their new £ 200million training centre on monday , and it belongs among the finest football centres of excellence in the world			1
but @entity0 have not always enjoyed such luxury			1
@entity6 remembers the club 's more humble roots , from their iconic old @entity10 training ground to training side - by - side with rivals @entity12 at @entity13 , complete with scary security guard			1
welcome to @entity0 's new £ 200m @entity15 ... with circular dressing rooms , cookery classes and altitude training for many years now , a tiny corner of rural @entity20 has been purely football			1
past the @entity22 , throw a right at the roundabout , through the lights and you get to @entity13 , home – among other things – to the training grounds of @entity20 's two football clubs			1
take a five - iron and strike it well from @entity12 's northerly pitches and the chances are those picking the ball up will be wearing @entity0 blue			1
so close they could hardly escape each other even if they wanted to			2
an aerial view of @entity0 's new £ 200m @entity40 - which is being hailed as the best training facility in the world the complex is attached to the club 's @entity44 via a footbridge over @entity47 @entity0 have come a long way from their old home at @entity50 - here they play against @entity51 in 1936 @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 ( left to right ) are put through their paces at the new complex @entity0 's legendary goalkeeper @entity59 , who played for the club between 1949 and 1964 , sits on a terrace at @entity50 when @entity12 manager sir @entity63 talked of his club 's ' noisy neighbours ' this is what he meant			1
today , however , it changes			0
@entity69 's players are turning their sports cars and their suvs east towards the previously neglected @entity20 suburbs of @entity73 and @entity74			2
here , opposite their own @entity44 , lies their new training ground			2
@entity77 columnist @entity76 was given an exclusive tour of the world - class new training facility by @entity81 , @entity0 's head of @entity83			1
click here to watch a fun , quick - fire q&a with the two former @entity87 , including how the old friends describe each other in just three words ... and you can read the full , brilliant interview as @entity76 met @entity81 from 10pm on monday night by visiting www.dailymail.co.uk/sport hailed – admittedly by @entity0 themselves – as one of the best sporting facilities in the world , the @entity40 has cost in the region of £ 150million to build , has 16 pitches , its own 7,000 - seater reserve stadium , an accommodation block and even a sixth - form college to serve its local community			1
@entity13 , it must be said , was somewhat different			1
@entity0 's home for more than a decade - they previously trained at the rather iconic @entity10 centre in @entity20 's inner - city – it did n't even have a security barrier for many years			1
instead it had a rather fierce looking @entity110 named ' @entity111 ' who spent his days peering at you from inside a one - man sentry booth decorated with @entity0 calendars , posters and gifts from the players			1
if he knew you , @entity111 would tell you his latest joke			0
if he did n't , he would probably scare the life out of you			0
this was @entity122 , though			0
things were different , then			0
the first manager i encountered there was @entity127			0
' @entity128 to meet you , i hate your paper , ' were his first words to me in the winter of 2001			0
back then the media used to walk round the back of the main building , up some rather fragile - looking stairs that always needed painting and in to a room that doubled up as an analysis ' suite ' – it had a round table and some chairs – when we were n't there			2
on a shelf on the side was a never ending supply of footballs and black marker pens			0
once a week the players would file past and sign			0
@entity127 was often late , usually because he had been playing head tennis with his coaches out the back			0
' do n't say i admitted that , ' he once said			0
' it will invalidate my medical insurance on my back			0
' in the @entity162 , the days of @entity0 stars like @entity161 , left , players were put through their paces on an athletics track at @entity165			1
here , the former @entity167 international is given tips by @entity171 @entity170 one - mile runner @entity169 after the @entity174 break in 1969 , @entity0 players were sent on a 30 - minute run at @entity176 to shed off any excess pounds @entity0 's former first - team training ground @entity10 is now used by the club 's academy for matches the club 's younger ranks are put through their paces ahead of their friendly against @entity184 in september 2013 city under 18s take on @entity187 at the old @entity10 training ground in those days , players such as @entity190 and @entity191 ruled the roost at @entity13 , waiting round the corner to fire footballs at team - mates emerging in to the complex 's wide open spaces from a changing block that looked rather like something out of the film @entity201			1
it was all very high school			0
@entity203 , meanwhile , used to use that area as his own private driving range , golf balls pinging high in to the distance from his driver			0
a very good golfer , maybe @entity203 was aiming at sir @entity63 across the other side of the hedge			0
@entity127 once made his exit from @entity13 under a blanket on the back seat of a car			1
his crime ? to make a joke about @entity219 and hub caps as he signed @entity190			0
the @entity222 newspaper sent reporters dressed in black curly wigs to ambush him			0
' @entity111 ' on security would have eaten them for his breakfast			2
as time passed , things changed			0
the essence of @entity13 never did , though			1
even to this day – when @entity0 had to erect a big , cold tent to host @entity233 press conferences – the throwback feel of the place remains			1
@entity236 liked to hold press conferences at 8am			0
i think it was a macho thing			0
the problem was that , as results faded , the media just stopped turning up			0
maybe that was the plan all along			0
@entity0 entered a new era when @entity244 introduced a table to sit behind when he spoke to journalists at press conferences @entity244 made sure he knew everybody 's name at @entity13 during his time at @entity0 , and when he was sacked there were tears from some @entity244 , meanwhile , finally introduced a table to sit behind for press conferences			1
for @entity0 , that was progress			1
they loved @entity244 at @entity13 , especially the women			1
he knew everybody 's name			2
when it emerged that he paid for the £ 2,000 - a - night top - floor suite at @entity20 's @entity262 out of his own pocket every night , the @entity259 's legend only grew			1
@entity0 were n't bad on the field under @entity244 , either			1
when he was sacked – unjustly – they cried at @entity13			1
on his arrival , @entity265 did his best to tart things up a bit			0
he thought @entity13 was ' unfit for purpose ' and he was probably right			1
given that he had come from @entity271 , though , it said everything			0
@entity265 was unhappy with @entity0 's @entity13 training ground facilities upon his arrival from @entity271 @entity265 disliked the media getting too close so they built us a pre-fabricated hut just inside the entrance while money was spent on the dressing rooms , too			1
pretty soon , @entity111 on security was no more			2
someone did n't like his tattoos apparently			0
with the @entity285 money that soon arrived , @entity13 got new signage and some trees lining the driveway that were rumoured to cost £ 1,000 each			1
the training ground soon got @entity290 and @entity291 , too			2
@entity290 often used to cycle to work – with his faithful aide ' @entity293 ' driving behind him in case of ' emergencies ' – while the photographers that lined the public footpath nearby feasted on the punch - ups that , for a while , became part of the @entity0 story			1
i once suggested to one of @entity290 's coaches that the club just erect a big fence to protect the sessions from the lenses			2
' the council wo n't let us , ' he replied			0
' anyway , it would be cheaper if the players just stopped fighting			0
' @entity316 ( centre ) and @entity291 ( right ) get a telling off after coming to blows during a training session in december 2011 @entity320 ( left ) had to be restrained back by his @entity0 team - mates after his spat with @entity291 at @entity13 the maverick @entity324 forward ( left ) had to be led away by @entity325 ( right ) as things turned violent @entity290 ( left ) tries to laugh off the feud between @entity291 and @entity320 ( right ) after their fight former @entity0 boss @entity290 ( left ) came to blows with @entity291 ( right ) during a training session in january 2013 for a while the bad publicity was a problem for @entity0 but , on the whole , they were impressively sanguine			1
across the fence , @entity63 was paranoid about the secrecy of his training sessions , as indeed is @entity338 now			2
@entity0 , though , took a different view			2
on learning that one geeky fan was climbing a tree to view sessions through binoculaurs , they did n't set the dogs on him			2
instead they invited him inside for a guided tour and a meet - and - greet session			1
the @entity349 site pictured during its early stages of redevelopment from a brownfield site into the training complex the 7,000 - capacity academy stadium during the middle of construction and before any turf was laid for the pitch city youth players play head tennis before construction begins , with the @entity44 in the background at the ' @entity364 ' i suspect things may be a little different			1
that 's what they call progress			2
if you want to spy on training this week , you may wish to hire a drone			2
@entity373 and his players will want for nothing , that 's for sure			2
the @entity377 is a different place now			0
they will still moan , though			0
for a start – from their homes in the @entity384 enclaves of @entity385 , @entity386 and @entity387 – the new place is a lot more difficult to get to .			0

@entity0 *unveil* new state - of - the - art £ 200m training centre on monday
@entity77 's @entity76 was given a guided tour of the complex by @entity81
@entity0 have left their old base at @entity13 - next to where @entity12 train
@entity13 's facilities pale in *comparison* with new set - up , and used to have just one security guard
