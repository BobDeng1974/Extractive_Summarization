’ angelman syndrome is a rare genetic condition first identified in 1965 by a @entity19 doctor , @entity14			1
dr @entity14 had noticed similarities between a small number of previously undiagnosed children that seemed to indicate they had a common problem			2
after seeing a painting in the @entity143 museum in @entity144 , @entity145 , entitled a boy with a puppet , he was inspired to write a medical paper titled @entity149			0
the syndrome - originally called ' @entity6 ' because of the characteristic happy demeanour and stiff jerky movements of the children - was renamed @entity14 syndrome in 1982			1
although at first little was known and indeed few other cases identified , in recent years much more has been learned			0
during the 1980s advances in genetic medicine made it possible to diagnose increasing numbers of cases and also to start identifying the cause			0
most as children are diagnosed between the ages of three and seven when the characteristic physical and behavioural features become evident			0
