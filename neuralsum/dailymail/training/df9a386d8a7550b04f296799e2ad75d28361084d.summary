by @entity1 reporter published : 12:49 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 14:05 est , 23 may 2013 two hungry young galaxies that collided 11 billion years ago are rapidly forming a massive galaxy about 10 times the size of the @entity7 , astronomers have discovered			1
researchers say the groundbreaking discovery is ' the equivalent of discovering a missing link between winged dinosaurs and early birds ' , and sheds new light on how the @entity15 formed			1
the new mega-galaxy , dubbed @entity18 , ' is the brightest , most luminous and most gas - rich submillimeter - bright galaxy merger known , ' the authors write in @entity21			2
the red data are from the @entity29 's @entity28 ( @entity28 ) atop @entity30 , @entity31 , and show dust - enshrouded regions of star formation			0
the green data , taken by the @entity36 's @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , near @entity37 , @entity38 , show carbon monoxide gas in the galaxies			2
in addition , the blue shows starlight			0
a bridge of material connects the two galaxies , showing they are interacting			2
the blue blobs outside of the circle are galaxies located much closer to us the galaxy pair was initially identified in the @entity53 data as a single bright source , named @entity18			2
follow - up observations showed that it is in fact two galaxies , each boasting a stellar mass equal to about 100 billion @entity61 and an equivalent amount of gas			1
the galaxies are linked by bridge of gas , indicating that they are merging			2
capturing the creation of this type of large , short - lived star body is extremely rare , the team said , @entity18 is fading away as fast as it forms , a victim of its own cataclysmic birth , the researchers say			0
as the two parent galaxies smashed together , they gobbled up huge amounts of hydrogen , emptying that corner of the universe of the star - making gas			0
' these galaxies entered a feeding frenzy that would quickly exhaust the food supply in the following hundreds of million years and lead to the new galaxy 's slow starvation for the rest of its life , ' said lead author @entity88 of the @entity89 in @entity90			1
' this monster system of interacting galaxies is the most efficient star - forming factory ever found in the @entity15 at a time when it was only 3 billion years old			1
' finding this type of galaxy is as important as the discovery of the archaeopteryx was in understanding dinosaurs ' evolution into birds , because they were both caught at a critical transitional phase , ' @entity88 said			1

the new mega-galaxy , dubbed @entity18 , ' is the brightest , most luminous and most gas - rich submillimeter - bright galaxy merger known , ' the authors write in nature ' the @entity18 system is unusual not only because of its high mass and intense star - forming activity , but also because it exposes a crucial , intermediate step of the merging process , providing valuable insight that will help us constrain models for the formation and evolution of galaxies , ' said co-author @entity146 , also from @entity147			1
the onset of the merger has sparked a star - formation frenzy , with the system spawning stars at a phenomenal rate equivalent to roughly 2000 stars like the @entity154 every year			0
by comparison , a galaxy like the @entity7 today only manages to produce the equivalent of one @entity154 - like star per year			0
the discovery solves a riddle in understanding how giant elliptical galaxies developed quickly in the early universe and why they stopped producing stars soon after			1
other astronomers have theorized that giant black holes in the heart of the galaxies blew strong winds that expelled the gas			0
but cosmologist @entity146 , the @entity147 team 's leader , said that they and colleagues across the globe found definitive proof that cosmic mergers and the resulting highly efficient consumption of gas for stars are causing the quick burnout .			0

two galaxies collided 11 billion years ago and are rapidly forming a massive new mega-galaxy
@entity181 sheds new light on how the @entity15 formed
described as ' the equivalent of discovering a missing link between winged dinosaurs and early birds '
