the smiley toddler from @entity7 suffers from arthritis			1
he has it in his jaw , spine , hips , knees , legs , elbows , feet , ankles , each finger and every toe			1
every 12 weeks , @entity2 goes with his mother @entity19 , 23 , to have eighty of his joints drained under general anaesthetic at @entity22			1
he also undergoes chemotherapy treatment to ease his pain at home every week			1
@entity2 was diagnosed with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis when he was 18 months old			1
mrs @entity27 , who is currently pregnant with her fifth child , and her husband @entity29 , aged 41 , knew something was wrong as they watched @entity2 attempting to take his first steps			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ his feet kept on turning outwards when he tried to walk			1
he would be very clumsy			2
we took him to our doctor to get him checked out			2
‘ but we would never have imagined that he could have arthritis			1
‘ i only thought it was something you got if you were elderly			2
‘ i was absolutely gobsmacked			2
the doctor told me " i know it 's a lot to take in "			2
‘ i still remember the words - it was quite a shock			2
‘ i was worrying that my other children could have it as well , but they said it was very unlikely two siblings will have it			2
’ mrs @entity27 , who is three months pregnant and has three children , @entity52 , four , @entity49 , also four , and @entity50 , seven months , said she struggled to accept that her son had to have chemotherapy at first			1
crippling : @entity2 has to go to @entity22 every 12 weeks with his mother , @entity19 ( pictured left ) , to have eighty of his joints drained under general anaesthetic side - effects of the treatment can include liver failure , kidney failure and blood cancer			1
mrs @entity27 added : ‘ @entity2 can walk			1
on good days he 's still very wobbly and he falls over quite a lot			2
then , on bad days , he ca n't move			2
‘ he screams for hours			0
he 'll just push himself against a wall to try to get up , or bum - shuffle around the floor			0
about three or four months after he was diagnosed he literally could not move , he could n't stand and he was that way constantly , every day			0
‘ his brother and sister would go and play in the back garden and he would n't go out with them			0
‘ when we have good days now , it is a relief			0
family support : @entity2 with his brother and sisters , @entity52 , @entity49 4 , @entity50 7 months , and his mother , @entity19 , and father , @entity29 ‘ to see him stand up actually amazes me , it is like i have been given my son back			1
‘ the other kids are brilliant with him , they play with him			0
he wants to do , and he does try to do , all the things that @entity52 and @entity49 will do but he ca n't always do them			0
but he still gives it a go			0
‘ to see him smile is really nice , having seen him in so much pain			0
it 's like he is showing me that i 'm doing something right to try to control his condition			0
‘ it was a big decision for me to actually accept his chemo treatment every week , because of the side effects it can have			1
‘ i panicked , thinking " i do n't want him to have more problems "			0
then i thought " i 've got to , otherwise it 's not helping him "			0
i think it 's the best thing i 've done			0
‘ you do n't know what each day holds			0
one day he could get up and be running around , the next day he could not move			0
he ca n't talk so it 's difficult for him to let us know how he is feeling			0
‘ sometimes he might scream in pain , but he 's always still got a smile on his face			0
it makes me feel happy			0
@entity110 : @entity2 manages to keep a smile on his face despite being in pain and receiving treatment ‘ when he 's screaming in pain it just feels horrible , i ca n't do anything to stop it			1
