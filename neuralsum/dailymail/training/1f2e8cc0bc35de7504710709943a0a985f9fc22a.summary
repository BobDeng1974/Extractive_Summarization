we spend a third of our lives doing it			0
now scientists have finally discovered why we need to spend so much time sleeping - it helps clear the mind of the day ’s chemical clutter			0
while our body is at rest , the brain is hard at work removing toxins produced during our waking hours			0
scientists have finally discovered why we need to spend so much time sleeping - it helps clear the mind of the day 's chemical clutter ' @entity17 , they 've come to drain your toxins ' left to build up , these compounds can result in @entity21 ’s and other neurological diseases			1
the researchers conclude the clean - up process is so energy intensive , it would hinder our thinking if done when we are awake - hence the need to sleep			1
‘ this study shows that the brain has different functional states when asleep and when awake , ’ said lead researcher dr @entity31 , from the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , in @entity33			0
‘ in fact , the restorative nature of sleep appears to be the result of the active clearance of the by - products of neural activity that accumulate during wakefulness			1
’ the purpose of slumber has been debated for centuries , with @entity45 branding it ‘ a criminal waste of time			0
’ and although practically every species needs to sleep , many have suggested it is a faulty evolutionary hang - up that makes us more vulnerable to predators			0
the team found that unlike the rest of the body , which depends on the lymphatic system to drain away toxins , the brain has its own separate method of rubbish removal			0
scans on mice revealed the amount of energy used by the brain did not dramatically fall during sleep			1
this is because its cleaning activities increased 10-fold at times of rest , according to the researchers , who observed that significantly higher levels of toxins were also removed			1
the amount of brain power needed to clean up toxins means we would be unable to think clearly if the process took place during waking hours , the team speculated			1
while our body is at rest , the brain is hard at work removing toxins produced during our waking hours the findings , published in the journal @entity87 , go some way to explain the biological purpose of sleep and could lead to new ways to treat neurological disorders			2
‘ the brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choice between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up , ’ said dr @entity31			1
‘ you can think of it like having a house party			0
you can either entertain the guests or clean up the house , but you ca n’t really do both at the same time			0
’ and to aid the clean - up operation , scientists found brain cells can shrink by up to 60 per cent during slumber , to allow waste to be removed more effectively			1
they also observed that a hormone called noradrenaline is less active during sleep , suggesting it could be controlling the contraction and expansion of the brain ’s cells during sleep - wake cycles			2
‘ these findings have significant implications for treating “ dirty brain ” diseases like @entity21 ’s , ’ said dr @entity31			2
‘ understanding precisely how and when the brain activates the glymphatic system [ brain ’s cleaning system ] and clears waste is a critical first step in efforts to potentially modulate this system and make it work more efficiently			2

sleep is required to clear the by - products of neural activity that build - up when **people** are awake - if they build up they cause diseases like @entity21 's
the clean - up process is so energy intensive , it would hinder thinking if done while **people** were awake - this is why humans need to sleep
the amount of energy used by the brain does *n't* fall much during sleep
this is because its cleaning activities increase 10-fold at times of rest
brain cells can shrink by up to 60 *%* during slumber , to allow waste to be removed more effectively
