a string of gcse subjects deemed to be ‘ too easy ’ are facing the axe as part of a radical overhaul by the government ’s exam watchdog			1
courses such as @entity8 , and @entity9 – which teaches pupils about finding and applying for jobs – could be stripped of their status as gcses			1
education secretary @entity15 is already toughening up core subjects such as maths and @entity18 to boost the exam ’s academic reputation			1
now regulator @entity21 is set to draw up rigorous guidelines that are expected to result in a swathe of ‘ soft ’ qualifications losing their gcse label			1
critics believe many of these qualifications are popular with head teachers because they have allowed less academically gifted children to achieve passes in nationally recognised exams , so boosting the school ’s position in league tables			1
figures released last week show the number of pupils taking @entity8 this summer is 7,461 – a 120 per cent rise compared with the previous year			1
in 2013 , more than two - thirds of students achieved at least a c grade in the subject			0
@entity44 is being studied by 18,193 pupils this year , up 44 per cent on 2013 , when more than half scored a c or above			2
and just over 30,000 youngsters are taking @entity49 , which focuses on the hotel and restaurant trade – up 21 per cent on last year			2
again , more than half of students achieved a c grade or higher last summer			0
one question in last summer 's @entity8 exam included : ' @entity57 is the home of @entity58			1
this is an example of a major sports venue			1
name one other example of a major sports venue ' other ‘ soft ’ gcse subjects where pupils did particularly well last year included @entity65 , and @entity66			1
detractors say many of these gcses , introduced under the last @entity69 , lack academic discipline and ‘ discredit ’ the system			1
they want them axed or else become vocational courses			0
@entity21 , which approves courses drawn up by exam boards , has said that the number of non-academic subjects available ‘ devalues ’ the gcse ‘ brand ’			1
the organisation said that while it would not make rulings on individual subjects , it would be drawing up criteria that exam boards would have to meet if their papers were to keep their gcse status after 2016			2
thousands of students at some of the @entity92 ’s top universities have been caught cheating , new figures reveal			2
some take mobile phones into exams or copy coursework from the internet , while others rely on traditional methods such as hiding notes in the toilets and writing answers on their arms			0
the survey of nine of @entity92 ’s leading universities , including @entity107 and @entity108 , has uncovered nearly 4,000 cases of cheating in exams , plagiarism and malpractice since 2009			2
one student used a memory stick in the exam while another wrote notes on a water bottle			0
the guidelines will call for more rigorous content and assessment			0
one question in last summer ’s @entity8 exam included : ‘ @entity57 is the home of @entity58			1
this is an example of a major sports venue			1
name one other example of a major sports venue			1
’ in 2011 , the paper asked : ‘ which of the following is an example of a natural attraction ? @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 or the @entity135 ? ’ in @entity44 , questions over recent years have included : ‘ starting school is associated with which life stage ? middle adulthood , early childhood , adolescence or puberty ? ’ , and ‘ @entity143 was recently diagnosed with diabetes			2
he is obese , has a poor diet and drinks heavily			0
assess how @entity143 ’s lifestyle may affect his health and wellbeing			0
’ @entity150 , of the @entity151 , said : ‘ these are far too easy for gcses			2
this is obviously a dilution of academic standards and a sad reflection on our examiners that they expect so little			0
it is a tragic situation			0
‘ we must get rid of these @entity153			0
they discredit the entire exam system			0
’ professor @entity163 , director of the @entity164 at @entity165 , said : ‘ gcses have spawned in all sorts of directions , some of which look mainly to be a way of occupying the time of non-academic pupils rather than being qualifications that mean something and lead somewhere			1
‘ it does n’t make sense to have them as the equivalent of , say , physics or history			0
‘ the revision of the gcse structures is the ideal opportunity to decide which are of the right standards and which can be pruned to the benefit of everyone			0
’ prof @entity163 said many of them could be reclassified as vocational qualifications			2
other gcse subjects popular in colleges could also lose their status , including catering , @entity197 , and @entity198 and @entity199			0
the government has already indicated that , apart from maths , @entity18 , science and languages , it wants to retain gcses in religious studies , design and technology , art and design , drama , dance , music , physical education , computer science and citizenship studies .			0

critics believe ' @entity219 ' qualifications are popular with teachers as they allow less academically gifted children to achieve passes
