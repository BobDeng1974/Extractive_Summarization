by @entity0 published : 04:55 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 2 january 2013 a high school football player who clashed heads with an opponent during a game thought little of the knock			2
but after hitting his shoulder during practice days later , he was left in a coma with a huge brain swelling and internal bleeding			1
six years later , aged 23 , he struggles to remember things from just hours earlier and can not walk unaided			1
@entity12 , from @entity13 , is one of dozens of promising young footballers to have fallen victim to the terrifying ' @entity16 '			1
' it 's probably something to do with the immature brain , because our brain really keeps growing until you 're 18 , 19 years old , ' said dr @entity25			2
for years , doctors believed teenagers who suffered from @entity16 had blood clots from their first concussions , which went unnoticed until the second impact triggered brain swelling and further bleeding			1
but @entity12 had had a ct scan after the head clash , the first to exist for an @entity16 patient between hits , which showed nothing			1
dangerous : @entity16 is thought to cause blood vessels to swell and push against the brain , causing the loss of ability to walk , talk and recall simple things no one had been especially worried about @entity12 , because he had not passed or thrown up as a victim of concussion normally would			1
after taking the second hit , however , the 17 - year - old walked off the field and toppled forward into another player , dizzy , his legs numb			1
then he collapsed , his body shaking with seizures			1
dr @entity25 now believes that @entity12 's brain sent a message to the rest of his body for more blood , which filled the veins and arteries in his head and caused his brain to swell against the skull , causing further injury and damage			1
the ambulance technicians told his mother @entity74 that they did n't think he would make it to the hospital , she told @entity77			1
@entity12 had to spend 55 days in the intensive care unit - the same number as the one on his football jersey - and a further 43 in its rehab unit			1
he had suffered temporary cardiac arrest , hypertension , pneumonia , renal failure and sepsis			0
he could not walk or talk			2
@entity16 occurs when a person - most often a teenager - sustains a second head injury before recovery from an earlier head injury is complete			1
the second hit causes the brain to swell catastrophically , but it is the first injury that makes the player a walking time bomb			0
if , within several weeks , the victim suffers a second head injury , brain swelling , internal bleeding and death can occur within minutes			2
experts believe that after the second hit , the brain loses its ability to auto - regulate			0
blood vessel walls become less stiff and expand like a garden hose that becomes fatter as it ages			0
if enough blood vessels swell , it makes the brain bigger , squashing tissue up against the skull			0
there is serious concern about this problem in sport because so many players suffer head injuries			0
nobody knows the true number because they are often dismissed as ' dings ' and ' bell - ringers '			0
@entity12 has regained the ability to speak , but still lacks short - term memory			1
he can walk on a treadmill for six minutes at a time with someone at his side , but he ca n't balance on his own and depends on a wheelchair to get around			0
' for someone who was n't supposed to make it through , he 's beaten all the odds , ' said mrs @entity133 , adding that she now sees a different side to her son that had previously been reserved only for his school friends			0
' he was a class clown			0
he was hilarious , but we did n't see that much at home			0
' dr @entity25 said @entity12 's case showed that athletes need to get off the playing field if they 've had head injuries			2
the @entity146 has released guidelines suggesting that players with signs of concussion should be removed from play and not return until they have permission from their doctor and show no symptoms with exertion			0
in august 2011 , 22 - year - old starting fullback @entity156 died a week after collapsing at football practice at @entity158			1
his uncontrollable brain swelling led doctors and his father to believe it was @entity16			2
an estimated 1.7million people receive a traumatic brain injury , including concussions , each year , according to the @entity146			2
@entity12 's mother @entity133 added : ' i think the biggest thing is we have got to get the kids to understand to listen to their bodies			2
' we have this gladiator mentality out there , ' she said			0
take one for the team ... we 've got to change			0
' video : how a head knock could endanger your child 's life unfortunately your browser does not support @entity181 .			0
