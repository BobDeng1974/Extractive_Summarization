a generous attorney who overheard how a defendant could not afford restitution in his theft case has given the young father $ 983 so he avoids becoming a felon			1
@entity6 was sitting in @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 last thursday as he waited for his case , when he heard lawyers and the judge discussing @entity14 's predicament			1
@entity14 , a 27 - year - old married father of a 17 - month - old girl , paid $ 150 to $ 200 for a stolen @entity18 truck last year and then sold it for $ 275 to another buyer , who in turn sold its parts , authorities said			1
the defendant , who had one other conviction for a fourth - degree assault in 2011 , pleaded guilty to a felony charge of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle , but the deputy district attorney agreed for it to be classified as a misdemeanor if he paid $ 983 to the owner of the truck , @entity34 reported			1
generous : @entity14 , left with his wife , was ordered to pay $ 983 to the owner of a stolen truck in order to avoid a felony but could not pay up			1
an attorney , @entity6 , right , overheard and offered the money scene : @entity6 had been waiting for his case to start in @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 last thursday when he heard @entity14 's lawyer telling the court that his client could not afford the sum the vehicle 's owner , @entity47 , also lost camping equipment that was inside the car , as well as hundreds of dollars to cover his insurance deductible			1
but @entity14 said he was unable to pay the money			2
arrested : @entity14 admitted to buying a stolen truck for $ 150 - $ 200 and then selling it for $ 275 last year failing to pay the sum meant that the plea deal would fall through and he would be convicted of a felony			1
@entity6 , who has never met @entity14 before , said he knows how much a felony can affect employment and housing prospects			1
he said he felt the court simply wanted to compensate the truck 's original owner while not overly penalizing the defendant			0
the deputy district attorney , @entity65 , said he did not want to punish @entity14 too harshly because he was the most minor player in a much larger scheme , and he had admitted to the crime			2
so @entity6 stepped forward and offered the $ 983			2
@entity14 became emotional at the generous offer , his attorney , @entity68 , said			2
he shook the man 's had and expressed his thanks			0
' i 've never experienced anything like this , not for even a smaller amount , ' @entity68 told @entity76			0
' this is unique and i 've been practicing for 22 years			0
' under the state 's law , an attorney is not allowed to give or loan his client money , but @entity6 does not represent @entity14 and mostly works in business law			2
@entity68 , who had never seen @entity6 before , said the attorney gave him a check that day			0
the judge told @entity14 that he should eventually pay @entity6 back			1
scheme : the truck was then taken to @entity88 , pictured , and sold for its parts , but the deputy district attorney concluded that @entity14 had been a tiny part of a much larger operation ' if i get paid back , great , ' @entity6 said			1
' if i do n't , no problem			0
i 'm not going to hold the kid to it			0
' @entity6 said he was happy to give the man a chance			0
' all of us sometime in our lives have done something we would rather not have done , ' he told @entity34			0
' and the time will come when perhaps we are going to be held accountable			0
and i think at that point we would like to have somebody show us mercy			0
