an @entity1 agent who authored a highly sensitive @entity1 interrogation manual submitted the document for copyright protection - making it available at the @entity6 for anyone with a library card to read			1
the inexplicable mistake has been reported by @entity11 journalist @entity10 who viewed the document , which was written in 2008 and submitted for copyright at the @entity14 in 2010			2
@entity10 reports that the filing is baffling for several reasons , not least that any member of the public can read the document that the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) fought for years to gain access to			1
publicly available : the @entity1 interrogation manual has been available for any member of the public to read at the @entity6 since 2010 the @entity1 did eventually provide the @entity20 with a copy of the interrogation guidebook in 2012 , but it was heavily redacted , reports @entity11 , with whole pages blacked out			1
unlike the very similar version which has been sitting in the @entity6 since 2010			0
interrogation : the @entity1 's interrogation methods have previously been made available only in heavily redacted form to the @entity20 in addition , the 70 - page manual is a secret government document and government documents can not be copyrighted : anything ' prepared by an officer or employee of the @entity41 government as part of that person 's official duties ' is not subject to copyright in the @entity41			1
' a document that has not been released does not even need a copyright , ' @entity46 , a government secrecy expert at the @entity47 told @entity11			0
' who is going to plagiarize from it ? even if you wanted to , you could n't violate the copyright because you do n't have the document			0
' calling the copyright filing ' a comedy of errors , ' @entity46 says it seems to be the result of ' gross incompetence and ignorance			0
' according to @entity11 , agent who authored the manual and then filed it for copyright is an @entity1 supervisory special agent who once worked as a unit chief in the @entity1 's counter-terrorism division			1
he registered the work under his own name , effectively claiming rights for the document for himself and not for the @entity1			0
@entity10 was able to compare the document obtained by the @entity20 with the unredacted @entity1 manual and find out what the blacked out parts in the @entity20 version might have contained			2
' a redacted sentence in the manual says the document is intended for use by the @entity1 's " clean " teams - investigators who collect information intended for use in federal prosecutions , ' writes @entity10			2
' that raises the question of whether teams collecting information that 's not for use in federal courts would have to follow the manual 's ( already permissive ) guidelines at all			0

the author of a sensitive @entity1 interrogation manual submitted the document for copyright protection
in doing so , the @entity1 agent made it available to the public at the @entity6
experts are baffled at the security lapse and why the officer *believed* the secret document needed copyright protection at all
the manual does n't even *qualify* for copyright because it is a government document
the @entity20 fought for years to gain access to the @entity1 interrogation manual
the @entity20 was given a heavily redacted version of the document last year
the officer who filed the document is a supervisory special agent who once worked as a unit chief in the @entity1 's counter-terrorism division
