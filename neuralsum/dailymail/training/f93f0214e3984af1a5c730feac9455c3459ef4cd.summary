warning : lord @entity0 , the geneticist and @entity2 peer , said there was a ‘ risk ’ the new @entity5 could lead to treatments which could do harm to people rather than improving their lives plans to allow terminally - ill patients to be given untested treatments without proper safeguards were branded ‘ dangerous ’ by a top scientist last night			1
lord @entity0 , the geneticist and @entity2 peer , said there was a ‘ risk ’ it could lead to treatments which could do harm to people rather than improving their lives			1
but another peer , lord @entity20 , who has multiple sclerosis , made an impassioned plea for the law to be changed , saying he was willing to try innovative jobs which could improve his quality of life			2
lord @entity29 , the former marketing expert for @entity30 , has introduced a @entity5 in the @entity31 aimed at allowing some people dying of cancer to be voluntarily treated with unlicensed drugs			1
it gained government backing earlier this week after further safeguards were proposed requiring doctors to get the agreement of another specialist in prescribing drugs			2
but the medical and legal professions are divided over the measure and the @entity45 advertising mogul faces an uphill struggle with nearly 40 amendments tabled to the @entity48			2
lord @entity29 has been campaigning for law changes to enable more innovation in treatment since his wife , novelist @entity53 , died from a form of ovarian cancer in 2011			2
yesterday , he denied that the legislation could give comfort to ‘ quacks or cowboys ’ and insisted that with the new safeguards it would provide greater certainty to doctors , helping them to innovate			2
the @entity5 would give legal protection to doctors who want to try different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options			1
but lord @entity0 warned that as currently drafted , the proposals would increase uncertainty and would create a lack of clarity , adding : ‘ the @entity5 as it stands is quite a dangerous @entity5			1
’ he said his medical career had been based on consistent innovation and lord @entity29 was mistaken if he thought practitioners were concerned about the risk of litigation in trying new treatments			1
‘ the risk is that if we encourage innovation , as we are inclined to do and as is happening in private practice at the moment for quite large fees , there is a real risk in the long term , ’ he said			0
as an example , he pointed to the decision of two internet companies which have offered to freeze the eggs of their employees to try to delay their childbearing			0
this could lead to the risk of high blood pressure , heart disease , osteoporosis or dementia among older mums who take up the offer and have children late in life			0
@entity2 ’s @entity106 , a former professor of medicine , warned the @entity5 as currently drafted left open ‘ to too great a degree the potential for harm by unorthodox , unregulated practitioners ’ and called for the safeguards to be tightened			1
backing : lord @entity29 ( right ) , the former marketing expert for @entity30 , has introduced a bill aimed at allowing some people dying of cancer to be voluntarily treated with unlicensed drugs lord @entity29 said he was happy to hold talks with peers on the @entity5 ’s provisions before the next stage of debate			1
‘ i am trying to deliver an @entity123 which is simple , completely straightforward and totally clear - providing clarity and certainty at the point of treatment , both to the doctor and the patient , he said			0
@entity45 former minister @entity131 , who suffers from multiple sclerosis , said : ‘ i suspect that i am typical of many who will try any innovative treatment			0
i am 16 days into a treatment with a new drug , @entity137 , which is approved for use in this country but only , i think , in the national neurological hospital in the wonderful @entity141			0
‘ at the moment there is no cure for @entity145 but these innovative treatments are making life better			0
after just 16 days of my experimental treatment , i certainly feel a marginal improvement — at least i am not declining further			0
‘ that may be the only hope one can offer many people — not that we can fix them but we will make the quality of their lives better for the long term and we will try to hold the disease at bay			0

new @entity5 aims to allow those dying of cancer to be given unlicensed drugs
it would give legal protection to doctors who want to try different treatments
but lord @entity0 said there was a ' risk ' it could do harm to patients
