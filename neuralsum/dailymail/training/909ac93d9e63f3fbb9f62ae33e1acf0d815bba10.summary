by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 05:21 est , 25 january 2013 a pensioner was arrested last night after allegedly throwing a banana at the referee during @entity5 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity6			1
the 74 - year - old @entity8 fan was interviewed by police before being released on bail			1
the incident harks back to the days when black footballers regularly had bananas thrown at them , but it is not thought to have been racially motivated			1
arrest : the referee of a game between @entity5 and @entity6 removes a banana from the pitch that was allegedly thrown from the crowd removal : the referee hands the fruit to another official after the incident in last night 's game ' we saw the banana thrown on to the pitch and then reviewed television coverage , ' football intelligence officer @entity28 told this is @entity30			1
' it appears a supporter was angered by a decision by the referee and aimed a banana at him			2
it was not aimed anywhere near any player			2
' the @entity39 game at @entity40 in @entity41 - upon - @entity42 finished 2 - 2 , leaving the host club at the top of the table in the division			2
@entity5 fans took to the internet to blast the pensioner 's actions			1
shameful : @entity52 winger @entity51 pictured in 1987 kicking away a banana which was thrown at him ' hopefully the stupid person who threw the item onto the pitch gets a lifetime ban from @entity59 , ' one supporter wrote on an online fan forum			0
' we do not want you back			0
' another added : ' not sure what 's worse , the fact that some t * * * threw something on the pitch or the fact that he was n't immediately pointed out or given a good kicking by those around him			0
' bananas being thrown on to the pitch has long been associated with the racism that blighted football in the 1980s			0
a famous image shows @entity79 legend @entity51 flicking a banana off the pitch after it was thrown at him while playing for @entity52			0
thankfully , racism is now only a rare occurrence in the stands , although the football authorities and police continue to work together to combat any incidents .			0
