by @entity0 moved on : @entity0 is happy as a divorcee the day of the wedding was perfect : the sun shone , the bride looked radiant and the food and drink flowed			1
posing with my three children and their father for the photos , i could n't have felt more delighted			1
except , unlike me , @entity11 was n't there as a guest			1
given that we 'd split four years earlier after he left - nearly destroying me in the process - it seems incredible i was invited to his nuptials , and that i 'd even wanted to attend			2
it was important for me to be there because i strongly believe the best way forward for scorned exes - particularly when there are children involved - is not revenge , but to accept every part of an ex 's new life without complaint			1
that includes his new partner			2
when our ten - year relationship ended , i could never have imagined attending @entity11 's wedding , nor giving him his own set of keys to my new family home so he could pop in			1
not when he had betrayed my trust in such a devastating way			2
until that point , @entity11 was my whole life			1
we 'd met in our late 20s , and within a few months , had moved in together and were planning a family			1
after four years , we had our first child , our daughter @entity43			2
he worked hard as a factory manager to provide for us , and my career as a script editor in the film industry dwindled when our third child came along , so i became increasingly dependent upon him financially and emotionally			2
i remember thinking : ' if he ever left me it would be like someone cutting off my right arm '			2
little did i know how much of a premonition that was			0
one night in 2003 , @entity11 announced he wanted to leave me and our children , then aged six , four and 18 months - and my world came crashing down			1
he 'd sobbed on my shoulder as he told me he 'd been having a fling with a local woman , a relationship which had now ended			1
and now we 'd probably have to sell our home			0
i realised there was no future for us as a couple and , for the first time , contemplated a terrifying future as a single mother with no home and a career long past			1
worst of all , i was about to turn 40			1
not much of ' a catch ' for any new man either			0
surely , if anyone should be in floods of tears it should be me ? but at the time i was too angry and broken to cry			1
i was hurt and ashamed			0
my self - esteem was gone			0
the aftermath of that catastrophic night was horrendous			0
at first , i waded through the days in a state of complete shock			0
first family : @entity0 and @entity11 and their three children when they were still together then the anger and emotional pain started to take hold			1
i moved into a rented house and would cry and shout at him down the phone , and avoid conversations when we swapped the kids over at weekends			0
but very quickly i realised i had to make a choice about how to deal with what had happened , or it was going to eat up my life and harm the children into the bargain			1
i could choose to let my bitterness and rage rule my thinking - and become one of those angry women who are always slagging off their ex and never seem to find any real joy in life any more			1
or , i could put on a brave face and do what was right for the children while my soul slowly died inside			1
but i knew that by keeping anger and hurt hidden , it would eventually find its way out in the form of illness or depression			0
or might there be a third way ? but what was this third way ? how could i possibly build a healthy relationship to co-parent children with someone who had metaphorically ripped out my heart , then carved it up with a chainsaw for good measure ? although i was livid with what he 'd done , i knew that punishing him was not going to help anyone			2
after all , they were half of both of us			0
if i said bad things about their dad that meant i was also attacking half the child			2
one day , fighting back the desire to vent my anger , i sat @entity11 down and said : ' our children do n't care who 's done what ; they do n't judge us			1
all they care about is how we deal with this from now on			0
they are learning from us how to manage relationships - we need to show them a better way			0
' he went quiet and i knew that through his grief , confusion and guilt he understood what i was saying			0
but it all hinged on me finding a way to forgive and move on			0
so i put myself on what i can only describe as a crash course on how to see myself not as a victim , but as a woman blessed with a chance to start again			2
second wife : @entity11 is now married to @entity164 and @entity0 is happy for them i may not have chosen for my family to be broken up in such a painful way , but i realised that the choice of how i dealt with the situation was mine			1
it was tough at times			0
i had to accept some responsibility for what had happened			0
instead of hating my beloved man for throwing away our relationship for a meaningless fling , i tried to see things from his point of view			0
clearly , the stress of supporting us all was huge			0
he was deeply unhappy and just because we had made three beautiful babies together did n't mean he had to spend the rest of his life with me			2
painfully , i began to see that outside of the children , @entity11 and i had very little in common			1
i devoured every self - help book friends could lend me , ignored negative comments and ' advice ' about my ex ( many friends deemed my attitude ' weird ' ) and determined to transform myself from bitter single mother to someone free to have fun again			2
within a few years , i had been on some wonderful dates and realised i could actually enjoy sex more in my 40s than when i was in my 20s			1
because i was n't bitter about the past and refused to believe all men were untrustworthy , i was complimented on being easy to date			2
i launched a website , the @entity203 , to show couples there is a better way to manage break - ups			0
i also set up a directory where they could find mediators , collaborative lawyers and counsellors			0
amicable split : @entity0 , @entity11 and their children pose for a family photo on his wedding day to @entity164 i danced joyfully at parties and made new friends			1
of course , it bothered me when @entity11 announced he was seeing @entity164 , a beautiful young woman 20 years my junior			1
and there was a flash of jealousy but , after getting over the initial strangeness of it all , she and i got along brilliantly			0
i genuinely adored my children 's new stepmother			2
i was heartened when she confided her relief that an angry divorce like that of her parents was not something my - now our - children would have to suffer			1
when they married , four years after @entity11 and i split , my friends considered it beyond bizarre that i wanted to go to the wedding			1
i was delighted to be invited			0
was n't this what i 'd set out to achieve ? this was surely how the perfect female ex behaved			0
as the photos were taken , on @entity247 beach , the photographer turned to @entity11 , the children and me and asked us to gather for a photograph			1
i could sense people around us were clearly uncomfortable with the line - up and there were a few double - takes			0
and even i took some persuading			0
he could see that the kids and i were still very important to @entity11 , and that it was only right to have a family photo of us at the wedding			1
unlikely alliance : @entity0 with her ex husband 's new wife , @entity164 , who she gets on with famously and i 'm so grateful he did , as i look back at that photo with real pride now			1
i do n't think i 'd feel the same if instead i 'd chosen to play the blame game			0
@entity11 and i have three perfectly well - balanced children who do not feel torn between warring parents			1
they live with me , but stay with him and his new wife frequently and @entity11 visits them at my house often			1
when i read about the terrible increase in the numbers of children self - harming due to the stress of divorce , i thank @entity280 that i had it in me to be magnanimous and forgive			2
to put the needs of my children first			2
so , if you are battling through a break - up and want to build a new and healthy relationship with your ex , do n't listen to the people who raise their eyebrows when you tell them you are doing breakfast for the whole family on christmas morning - including your ex and his new wife			0
or , if they think it 's strange that your ex is building you a new kitchen in his rare moments of spare time , because he knows that will make life much easier for you as a mum			0
what 's so wrong with being nice to your ex ? it 's hard to be a perfect wife , even harder to be a perfect ex - but the rewards are beyond measure			0

@entity0 met @entity11 when they were in their 20s

but just before she turned 40 , he had an affair
they separated and @entity0 was bitter and bereft
but she realised being angry would have a bad effect on their children
so she made an effort to get along with her ex
she even went to his wedding when he *remarried* a younger woman
believes other women and their children will be happier if they are like her
